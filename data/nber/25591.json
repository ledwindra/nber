    "abstract": "\n\nWe estimate whether consumers respond to local energy costs when purchasing appliances.  Using a dataset from an appliance retailer, we compare demand responsiveness to a measure of energy costs that varies with local energy prices versus purchase prices.  We strongly reject that consumers are unresponsive to local energy costs under a wide range of assumptions.  These findings run counter to the popular wisdom, which motivates energy standards, that energy costs are a shrouded attribute.  Capital investments are an important channel for electricity demand response and may explain some of the large differences between short and long run electricity price elasticities.\n\n",
