Are Engel Curve Estimates of CPI Bias Biased?

NBER Working Paper No. 13870

JEL No. D1,E3,J1,N3
ABSTRACT
A recent literature has advanced the use of Engel curves to estimate overall CPI bias. In this paper,
I show that the methodology is sensitive to the modeling of household demography. Existing estimates
of CPI bias do not account for the changing effect of household size on budget shares, and this can
lead to omitted variable bias. Since the effect of household size on demand changes over time the drift
in Engel curves attributed to CPI bias is partially explained by this effect. My estimates of the annual
rate of CPI bias from 1888 to 1935 are changed by at least 25%, and usually more than 50%, once
the changing effect of household size is accounted for.

Introduction
Estimates of historical real income are only as accurate as the price series used to de‡ate them.

Although there are numerous methodologies proposed to detect and correct the bias in contemporary
price series, for the past we are left with few (if any) options. Even if one is uninterested in the sources
of bias themselves, many would be interested in the results–the revised estimates of real income that
result from corrected estimates of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Indeed, our estimates of economic
performance would change considerably if we …nd that our historical price series contain substantial
bias.

To the extent that macroeconomic models hope to …t the historical data, corrected income

estimates for the past have numerous implications.
Measuring changes in the cost-of-living is a central goal of economic analysis and measurement.
Without accurate measures of in‡ation, the in‡ation-targeting of monetary policy would be seriously
compromised.

Similarly, without estimates of real income, it is impossible to accurately measure

economic growth, or to test empirical relationships between economic performance and other factors.
While there are numerous problems with estimating changes in the cost-of-living, Hausman (2003)
identi…es four broad classes of bias in the CPI. Substitution bias occurs when consumers move to
relatively less expensive goods, new goods bias arises because the CPI fails to incorporate the introduction of new items in a consumer’s basket of goods, quality change bias occurs when the CPI
fails to measure improvements in existing goods over time, and outlet bias occurs when consumers
purchase items at low-priced stores. These sources of bias have been known for some time and there
are solutions for each problem (Boskin, et al. 1996). Implementation of some corrections, however,
has lagged.
In addition to the large literature that looks at CPI bias in or for speci…c goods, recent studies
have documented the fact that the CPI contains a substantial overall upward bias. Using household
level data, Costa (2001) and Hamilton (2001) use Engel curves to estimate CPI bias. Engel’s Law,
which says that the share of the budget devoted to food decreases with total expenditure, is one of the
most persistent regularities in empirical economics. Costa and Hamilton use this regularity and argue
that, conditional on household characteristics and income, di¤erences in real income and predicted
expenditures would be due to bias in the prices that are used to de‡ate income.

Essentially, drift

in Engel curves over time for similar households would be due to mismeasured real income. There
are three key advantages to this approach. First, it allows us to estimate the extent of overall bias
in the CPI, not only the bias of particular goods.

Secondly, since the method uses survey data to

estimate CPI bias, one could derive cost-of-living indices for separate groups in the population, or for
groups whose cost-of-living may be unknown.

For example, Costa (2001) was able to produce the

such CPI bias can be estimated for both present and past populations if su¢ cient data exist. Given
these strengths, others have adopted the approach and have estimated CPI bias for other countries.
Beatty and Larsen (2005) use Engel curves to estimate bias in the Canadian CPI; Gibson, Stillman,
and Le (2004) for Russia; Larsen (2007) for Norway; and de Carvalho Filho and Chamon (2006, 2007)
for Brazil and Mexico. Others have extended the approach–Papalia (2006) estimates regional CPIs
for Italy and Almas (2007) extends the methodology across countries to estimate Purchasing Power
Parity (PPP) bias.
A weakness of the approach is that it is based on a time residual– the drift in the Engel curve
not explained by household characteristics or CPI-de‡ated income. Any omitted variable that e¤ects
demand and is correlated with time will be con‡ated with CPI bias. In this paper, I concentrate on
a straightforward example–household size. Household characteristics are a determinant of household
demand systems. There are several reasons to expect household size to exert an independent e¤ect on
demand, holding household composition …xed. Indeed, Engel’s Second Law notes that households of
the same proportional composition but di¤ering sizes could be welfare equated at di¤erent expenditure
levels.

This e¤ect could naturally change over time for the same reasons that the CPI may be

overstated– large households may purchase more goods in bulk– lowering the price paid for them
(a type of outlet bias).

Larger households may exhibit di¤erent shopping patterns than smaller

households. If there are scale economies in the household, large households will face lower prices for
public goods than private goods, and this would lead to di¤ering substitution bias for larger households,
although the direction of that bias is not clear.1 This is important insofar as the Engel approach to
CPI bias will capture outlet bias and substitution bias, but will not capture quality change or new
goods bias (Hausman 2003).

As such, both of the bias types captured by the Engel method may

While the income and substitution e¤ects for public goods go in the same direction, they move in opposite directions
for private goods. See Barten (1964), Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), and Nelson (1988) for more on the theory of
household economies of scale.

be in‡uenced by the e¤ect of household size on demand–the open question is whether the impact of
household size on these biases can be considered a form of CPI bias, especially in light of the fact
that the interpretation of the e¤ect of household size on demand has proved controversial (Deaton and
Paxson 1998, Gan and Vernon 2003, Logan 2007).
Costa (2001) and Hamilton (2001) do not estimate CPI bias independent of changes in the e¤ect of
household size on demand. In this paper I revisit the estimates of CPI bias from 1888 to 1935. The
period from the late nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century is important for several
reasons. First, the growing pace of industrial production in the United States during this time led it
to become the world’s leading economic power. As such, this is the period of American ascendancy.
Second, the peak of output in the late 1920s serves as the point where we measure the trough of
the Depression era– the severity of the decline in real output, consumption, and investment are all
sensitive to bias in price series. Third, unlike our contemporary estimates of CPI bias, the methodology
proposed by Costa and Hamilton is the only one available for the vast majority of historical periods.
It is therefore very important that we establish the method’s accuracy.
In this paper, I show that the e¤ect of household size, separate from the e¤ects of household
composition, has changed dramatically over time.

I then show that the Hamilton-Costa CPI bias

methodology, which attributes di¤erences in food shares over time not explained by household characteristics and relative price changes to CPI bias, implicitly assumes that the e¤ect of household size
is unchanged over time, although this is not the stated intent of their methodology. Although this
problem falls under the category of omitted variable bias, it is bias of a peculiar type– the e¤ect of
household size was not omitted in the traditional sense of the phrase, but was explicitly assumed not
to vary at all over this time period. Given the large changes in the e¤ect of household size on demand,
estimates of CPI bias may be overstated.
To gauge the magnitude of the bias I modify the estimation procedure, using an Engel curve that
controls for both household composition and size but also allows the e¤ect of household size to vary
over time independent of CPI bias.

the measurement of real income as well.

Much of what the methodology attributes to CPI bias is

actually the changing e¤ect of household size on demand.

2

The Changing E¤ect of Household Size on Demand

To consider the e¤ects of household size on demand I estimate the demand for food with American
household survey data covering 1888 to 1935. The survey data used here comes from three national
consumer expenditure surveys taken in 1888-1890, 1917-1919, and 1935-1936, the same as those used
in Costa (2001).

The surveys are the Department of Labor’s Cost of Living of Industrial Workers

in the United States and Europe (1888-1890), the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Cost of Living in the
United States (1917-1919), and the Department of Labor’s and Department of Agriculture’s Study
of Consumer Purchases in the United States (1935-1936).

Each survey is a large national survey

of consumer expenditures and these surveys are comparable insofar as they each detail household
expenditures, income, and household composition. Similarly, each survey used a similar methodology, interviewing subjects in their homes, verifying expenditures where possible, and using consistent
categories for goods.2 In addition, each survey has comprehensive demographic information on all
household members, which allows us to measure the e¤ect of household size separate from the e¤ects
of household composition. As Costa (2001) notes, since the surveys are broadly consistent with one
another it is possible to derive trends in demand from them.
Since the goal here is to look at the e¤ect of household size on demand, the Engel curve will need
to distinguish between the two e¤ects.

I use the standard Rothbarth speci…cation to separate the

e¤ect of household size from household composition on the budget share. The regression takes the

comparability with later consumer expenditure surveys, this paper concentrates on the oldest suverys.

of household size on demand is .
Table 1 shows summary statistics from the three historical surveys.

The average share of the

budget devoted to food does decrease over time, but household size changes little in the surveys from
1888 to 1917. Table 1 also shows estimates of the e¤ect of household size on the food share in 1888,
1917, and 1935. The coe¢ cients in the table show the e¤ect of household size on the budget share
devoted to food ( ) for each year using an OLS regression. For example if household size were doubled
in 1888, the share of the food budget share would decrease by roughly 2.3%.4 There are several items
of interest in Table 1. As the table shows, the e¤ect of household size on demand, holding household
composition constant, changes signi…cantly over time. We can also compare these historical estimates
of the scale economy to contemporary estimates. Deaton and Paxson’s (1998) estimate for 1990 from
the Consumer Expenditure Survey, -.008, is signi…cantly lower than any of the historical estimates in
Table 1. As such, the e¤ect of household size on demand has changed signi…cantly over time both in
the historical data and in comparison to contemporary estimates.

CPI Bias and Household Size

3.1

Measuring CPI Bias with Engel Curves

There are several reasons to use consumer expenditure surveys to estimate CPI bias.

As Hamil-

ton (2001) argued, estimates of CPI bias for particular populations would tell us more about living
standards than aggregate estimates of real income. Similarly, household surveys can act as a check
against our estimates of real income by seeing if consumer expenditures agree with the estimates of
price changes.

Costa (2001) has argued that, due to data limitations, household surveys are likely

the only source available to estimate CPI bias in the past. Using Engel curves to capture CPI bias
hinges on the fact that Engel curves relate the budget share to real household income. If food’s share
of the budget moves more or less than we would predict given estimates of changes in prices (from,

say, the CPI), then movements in real income, measured directly from the Engel curve, would tell us
about mis-measurement of real income from sources such as the CPI. The methodology is entirely
general, any expenditure category could be used. The availability of price indices for food over long
time spans leads food to be the primary expenditure category used since changes in relative prices
must be controlled for.
Estimating CPI bias from Engel curves requires a number of assumptions. Decomposing food and
non-food expenditures into a price index and quantity index requires that food be additively separable
in the household’s utility function.
of food and non-food.

Furthermore, there must be homotheticity in the subutilities

With these conditions the bias of non-food does not e¤ect the foodshare

through complementarities of substitutabilities through some unmodeled channel. Hamilton (2001)
further notes that food is chosen because (1) it has an income elasticity that is sensitive to the
measurement of income, (2) it is non-durable and therefore not subject to stock and ‡ow e¤ects (this
would, naturally, be stronger in the past than today), (3) food does not involve the troublesome
"de…nitional problems" of other expenditure categories and (4) because the Working-Leser Almost
Ideal Demand System (AIDS) has a functional form that has successfully estimated the demand for
food. It is also important to note that the method requires the dependent variable to be the budget
share for food–food consumption and expenditure are likely to contain CPI bias themselves.
Beginning with the Almost Ideal Demand System for food

where w is the share of the budget devoted to food, P is the true, unobserved price index for food
(F ), nonfood (N ), and all goods, Y is household expenditure, X is a vector of household characteristics,
and u is the error term; note that the true cost of living in year t, in place j, Pj;t , is a weighted average
of the prices of food and non-food
ln Pj;t =

ln PF;j;t + (1

) ln PN;j;t

and those prices are measured with error (which is CPI bias) such that

+ ln (1 + Ej;t )

(3)

is the CPI, and E is the cumulative measurement error in

the price index from year 0 to year t. Note that the measurement error would also apply to the prices
of food and non-food in the same manner, and that aggregate error would also be a weighted average
of the errors in food and non-food. Substituting (3) into the Almost Ideal Demand System (2) and
rearranging terms yields

since two households with the same in‡ation

adjusted expenditures and demographic composition should have the same shares of the budget devoted
to food, since changes in relative prices are accounted for and income has been de‡ated. If the Engel
curve is stable over time, changes in the foodshare would be due to the mis-measurement of real income
over time–CPI bias.

Since we now have

if we assume that the bias between food and non-food is constant and that both food and nonfood

would have an e¤ect on the demand for food.
If data on CPI measured relative price changes by region are unavailable, estimates of relative price
changes over time would collapse into the time dummy as there would be no regional variation. This
is the circumstance for the 1888-1917 estimates of CPI bias. In this instance, the Engel cure used to
estimate CPI bias is

I use the estimate of ' from the 1917/1935 CPI bias regressions to estimate the 1888/1917 CPI
bias, which is the same methodology adopted in Costa (2001).
The issue of changing household size e¤ects concerns variables in the matrix X, which contains
the household’s composition. Since a household of size n can be disaggregated into a …nite number

of distinct groups, such that n =

The functional form in (4) controls for household composition and the e¤ects of household size
simultaneously. The Hamilton-Costa form cannot separate the e¤ects of household size and composition, it implicitly assumes that not only composition, but also household size induce the same change
on the food budget share over time. While one can change composition and not household size, one
8

cannot change household size without changing composition. It is impossible to estimate CPI bias
while controlling for changes in the e¤ect of household size on demand with the demographic modeling
that Hamilton and Costa use. While one may want to assume that household composition has the
same e¤ect on demand over time, the empirical results in Table 1 give us strong evidence that the
e¤ect of household size on demand varies over time. Since the e¤ect of household size does vary with
time, the estimates of

t

that Hamilton and Costa attribute to CPI bias may be due to household size

e¤ects’ correlation with time.5 As Hausman (2003) notes, the "key identifying assumption (besides
functional form) is that the expenditure elasticities remain constant over time for a given category of
expenditure after controlling for demographic characteristics" (p. 38). If the e¤ects of demographic
characteristics themselves change over time, these will be con‡ated with CPI bias.

3.2

Correcting the Household Size Bias

Hamilton (2001) concedes that the method, which is indirect, attributes all movement in the Engel
curve unexplained by the other variables to CPI bias. If there are missing variables from the regression,
or if there are errors in variables, then estimates of CPI could be spurious, overstated, or understated
depending on the particular speci…cation problem. Fortunately, incorporating changes in the e¤ects of
household size on demand is straightforward. Since the regression is an Engel curve (and di¤ers from
the Hamilton Costa form only in being in per capita terms) the methodology employed earlier can
be used to estimate CPI bias while at the same time controlling for changing household size e¤ects.6
Recall that the earlier regression took the form
wf =

ln

x
n

+ ln n +

KP1

+ z+"

which disaggregates the e¤ects of household composition and changes in household size on demand
by design. This functional form can be easily augmented to estimate CPI bias by including terms for
changes in relative prices, de‡ating per capita income, and including variables for time and region.7
The regression now becomes
5

Hamilton (2001) describes robustness checks to his speci…cation, which included adding covariates, interacting income
with other covariates, and an instrumental variables speci…cation. None of these robustness checks interacted household
demography measures with time.
6
None of the assumptions needed to estimate CPI bias with Engel curves is violated by using the functional form
outlined here.

Note that regional (state) e¤ects were controlled for in the estimates of scale economies discussed in the previous
section.

so that changes in the Engel curve that derive from changing household size e¤ects can be estimated
separate from estimates of CPI bias. If changing household size e¤ects have an e¤ect over time on
movements in the Engel curve (if
will capture it, and estimates of

is statistically di¤erent from zero) then the speci…cation in (6)
t

will not su¤er from the omission of changing size e¤ects.

This

reformulation not only corrects for omitted variable bias due to changing household size e¤ects, but
also formally test the proposition that household size e¤ects have changed over time, independent of
changes in real income.
There are two important caveats to this approach. First, the magnitude of the omitted variable
bias is a function of the type of data that one wishes to use to estimate CPI bias.

For example,

the correction noted above is unlikely to result in signi…cant revisions for annual panel data based
estimates of CPI bias. Indeed, part of the reason that this issue may have been overlooked is due to
the fact that Hamilton used the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to estimate CPI bias in the
1970s, and this gave him annual observations of the same families over time. One of the arguments for
use of the methodology, however, is that it allows us to estimate the cost of living for speci…c groups
in the population, and we are unlikely to have annual panel data for every population whose living
standards we are interested in. In fact, it is most likely that we would be interested in populations
(both historical and contemporary) that we have relatively few repeated samples from, and as such
this correction may be needed most for populations whose cost of living would be best estimated by
this approach because they would be di¢ cult to estimate from other sources.
Secondly, it is useful to distinguish the issue here, about estimates of CPI bias that may su¤er from
omitted variable bias, from the general issue of modeling demographic variables in demand analysis. I
am concerned with the fact that household size may have a time varying e¤ect on changes in demand,
and should therefore be included in estimates of CPI bias that seek to control for changes in household
composition.

A separate issue is the modeling of demographic variables in demand equations in a

way that is theoretically consistent. See Pollack and Wales (1979, 1980, 1981) and Lewbel (1985) for
classic references on this issue, and Blundell, et. al. (2003) for the non-parametric case. While I make
no claims about the proper modeling of demographic variables in demand systems, it is important

10

to note that the discussion above is an example of the modeling of demographic variables in demand
systems. If Engel based estimates of CPI bias are sensitive to the e¤ects of household size on demand,
estimates of CPI bias should purge the e¤ects of household size from estimates of CPI bias.
Naturally, there are concerns about the method given above as well. For example, one has to argue
that preferences stay …xed over this (admittedly long) time period, and the welfare interpretation of
family size is unclear in the literature. Similarly, there are limits to the data at hand, which is not
a probability sample of the US population but targeted household surveys. But a defense of such
critiques can be made. First, concerns about stable preferences and data limitations would also apply
to Costa’s original estimates. Secondly, what I term here as omitted variable bias is a peculiar type–
the variable was not omitted in the traditional sense of the phrase, but it was explicitly assumed not
to vary at all over this time period. Indeed, it is Costa and Hamilton’s methodology that assumes
that household size’s e¤ect remains unchanged over time, which seems to be the more restrictive
assumption.

Third, although Costa and Hamilton concede that anything correlated with time will

in‡uence the results, what I note above is that a variable available to them in their original formulation
has the potential to revise the estimates of CPI bias substantially. As such, this is not a correction
involving an additional variable, but a problem in their econometric speci…cation. As noted earlier,
such a correction is important if one would wish to use this method to correct for CPI bias in the past.

CPI Bias and Household Size

4.1

Revised Engel Estimates of CPI Bias

Table 2 shows estimates of CPI bias with and without controlling for changing household scale
economies.

As further con…rmation of the changing economies of scale over time, the year and

household size interaction terms are statistically signi…cant in both sets of regressions. As predicted,
estimates of CPI bias decrease once the changes in household size are included, and the di¤erences in
the estimates of CPI bias are striking, reduced by 25% or more.8

For 1888 to 1917, controlling for

changes in household size reduces the estimate of CPI bias by nearly three-fold. For 1917 to 1935,
controlling for changes in scale economies reduces the estimate of CPI bias by 25%.
8

As expected,

These estimates of CPI bias should not be considered revisions of Costa’s (2001) estimates. Our baseline CPI bias
estimates will di¤er both because of methodology and the CPI series being corrected di¤er (Costa uses estimates of CPI
from the 1975 edition of the Historical Statistics of the United States while my estimates come from the 2006 edition).
The focus here is on the di¤erence between the household size corrected and uncorrected estimates.

11

the inclusion of the interaction decomposes the Hamilton-Costa "CPI bias" into the changing e¤ect
of household size and a time residual. For example, if one adds the coe¢ cient on the "Year is 1917"
variable to the household size-year interaction evaluated at the mean in Column II of Table 2, the
result is equal to the "Year is 1917" coe¢ cient in Column I.9 Unless one wished to argue that the
changing e¤ect of household size on demand is a form CPI bias, the lessened size of the time residual
substantially reduces the CPI bias estimates.
The stated goal of the Hamilton-Costa speci…cation is to assume that composition e¤ects are time
invariant.

As Costa (2001) explains "If the O’Grady’s in 1919 had the same total CPI-de‡ated

household expenditures as the Svensons in 1935 and both families had the same number of children,
then I attribute di¤erences in their food and recreation shares to CPI bias, controlling for changes in
relative prices" (p. 1292). To the extent that compositional e¤ects do change over time, however, the
Hamilton-Costa framework may attribute changes in compositional e¤ects of demand to CPI bias. In
Table 8 I fully interact household composition and size with time, and this results in further re…nement
of the CPI bias estimates. When household composition is allowed to have time varying e¤ects, the
estimated CPI bias changes dramatically.

For 1888-1917, the fully interacted model resulted in a

"Year is 1917" coe¢ cient estimate of 0.015, which was not statistically signi…cant.

For 1917-1935,

the "Year is 1935" coe¢ cient changes sign (0.029), but is statistically signi…cant.

In short, fully

interacting the model with compositional change causes the CPI bias to disappear from 1888 to 1917,
and a change in the direction of the bias from 1917 to 1935.
Figure 1 shows these di¤erences in CPI estimates from the historical CPI. In the …gure the
di¤erences between the new and historical CPI estimates are plotted against time.

As the …gure

shows, both the household size and fully interacted estimates revise downward CPI bias estimates
from 1888 to 1917, but from 1917 to 1935 the CPI bias estimates vary widely based on the modeling
of household size and composition changes. Figure 2 shows estimates of the CPI itself from 1888-1937
with and without household size bias corrections. These new estimates of CPI bias revise estimates of
consumer expenditures/consumption as well. Figure 3 shows CPI de‡ated real expenditures from 1900
to 1937. As the …gure shows, the household size corrected estimates of real expenditures are closer to
the CPI de‡ated real expenditure estimates than the uncorrected estimates, and the Hamilton/Costa
estimates are the lowest estimates of real expenditure from 1888 to 1917 and the largest for 1917 to
9

In general, it should hold that t;uncorrected = t;corrected + (Dt ln (n)). In the case of Columns I and II of Table
2, this is .026 + (.025)*(ln 5)=.066, which is close to the coe¢ cient from Column I of Table 2 (.065).

bias and real expenditure in the past.

explain CPI bias.

Secondly, changes in household size do not fully

Even after controlling for changing household size and composition with time,

there is still drift in the CPI that can be attributed to CPI bias, and it is signi…cant in the 1917/1935
regression. The inclusion of other time varying variables (such as changing household compositional
e¤ects) further revises the CPI bias estimates, however, suggesting that the Hamilton-Costa form is
sensitive to changes in household size and composition.

4.2

Further Estimates of CPI Bias

As mentioned earlier, CPI bias can be estimated for other consumption categories besides food, given
that they satisfy the conditions noted above. To see how the CPI estimates vary for di¤erent consumption categories I estimated CPI bias based on expenditures for entertainment and clothing. An
important caveat with these results (that does not apply to the food estimates) is that price indices
for clothing and entertainment may over- or under-estimate the regional di¤erences in prices more so
than the food estimates, since the food estimates were derived from city-level estimates. Given that
we do not have estimates of entertainment and clothing price indices for this period I interpolated the
regional price indices for these items using the food and overall price indices by region for 1917 to
1935. This may cause problems for the estimates of baseline CPI bias, especially since the 1888/1917
estimates require the estimate of ' from the 1917/1935 regressions. Even with this caveat, the sensitivity of the results to the modeling of household size and composition should be una¤ected, unless
household size is somehow correlated with the price index in the Historical Statistics of the United
States, which seems unlikely.
Table 3 shows estimates of CPI bias based on entertainment expenditures. From 1888 to 1917, the
correction for household size and the interaction of household composition with time actually increase
the estimates of CPI bias. From 1917 to 1935, the correction and interactions have little e¤ect on the
estimates of CPI bias. Table 4 shows estimates based on clothing expenditures. For 1888 to 1917,
the household size correction and composition interaction change the sign of the CPI bias, and the

13

magnitude of the di¤erences is large as well, larger than the di¤erences for food from 1888 to 1917.
For 1917 to 1935 the correction and composition interactions decrease the size of the bias, although
all of the estimates are in the same direction.

These estimates are strong con…rmatory evidence

that the Hamilton-Costa methodology is sensitive to the modeling of household size and composition,
regardless of consumption category considered.

Conclusion

Estimating bias in the overall CPI is important, and the Engel approach has been advanced as a
method that could correct our CPI estimates. I explored here how Engel curve estimates of CPI bias
may be biased themselves if changes in household size’s e¤ect on demand are not accounted for. The
results here suggest that estimates of CPI bias are changed by at least 25%, and usually more than
50%, once changes in size e¤ects are controlled for.
to commend the Engel based approach.

Even with this correction, there is still much

As the results here showed, the household size correction

does not eliminate the CPI bias. The open question is whether the household size correction modi…es
our estimates of CPI bias or decomposes it.

For example, if it is true that larger households are

more prone to outlet bias than smaller households, then part of the household size correction should
be attributed to outlet bias, and added into the overall CPI bias estimates. Is this e¤ect CPI bias,
household size bias, or a combination of the two? Since more than one type of CPI bias may be present
the household e¤ect itself, or at least the portion due to CPI bias, could be decomposed further. To
do so one would need to assert that households of di¤erent types face di¤erent price changes over time,
and that remains a controversial issue in CPI theory and empirics. If one holds that all households
face the same prices then the results alter our Engel based estimates of CPI bias.
The results here with respect to household size are consistent with calls for group-speci…c CPIs.
Although Boskin, et al. (1996) rejects the idea that prices may change more rapidly for some groups as
opposed to others, Pollak (1995, 1998) has held that these sorts of di¤erences are important, and that
group level CPIs should be investigated further. Since households of di¤erent sizes may be more or
less prone to di¤erent types of CPI bias, it may be useful to know how this decomposition of HamiltonCosta CPI bias should in‡uence our notion of overall CPI corrections. More research is needed on
whether this household size e¤ect may be attributed to consumption patterns that constitute CPI bias
or is a time varying e¤ect that was erroneously attributed to CPI bias.

Data Appendix
The Consumer Expenditure Surveys

I used three consumer expenditure surveys in this paper, covering the years 1888-1890, 1917-1919,
and 1935-1936. While theses surveys are not nationally representative, they are broadly comparable
and have been used extensively to estimate historical demand systems. For the 1888-1890 survey, the
sample was selected only from the following nine industries: pig iron, bar iron, steel, bituminous coal,
coke, iron ore, cotton textile, wool textile and glass. Sample families, limited to those representing
more than two persons, were chosen from employer records. These households were then selected to
provide detailed expenditure information to survey respondents, and in most instances expenditures
were veri…ed by local merchants. Twenty-four states were covered. In total, nearly 7,000 American
families were surveyed. For more on the sampling see Logan (2006).
The 1917-1919 data were obtained from the surveys over 12,000 families of wage earners or "small
salaried workers." As with the 1888-1890 survey, households were selected from employer records.
Sample families were chosen such that there are only husband and wife families with at least one
child; the salary earners had to earn less than $2,000 per year; families had to reside in the community
at least one year prior to the interview; families could not have more than three boarders; families
could not be “slum”or "charity"; and non-English-speaking families had to reside in the United States
for more than …ve years. All the selections are from ninety-nine cities throughout 42 states.
In the 1935-1936 survey, only native-born families living in the United States were selected. The
sample covered 51 cities, 140 villages, and 66 farm counties throughout 30 states. Except for New
York City; Columbus, OH; and the South, only white families were chosen. Families in large cities
had to earn more than $500 a year and those in smaller localities had to earn more than $250 a year.
There was no income limit on households in this survey, and self-employed households were included
as well. The data used in this paper comes from a random sample of 6,000 families of the 61,000
who provided both income and expenditure information. Since the 1935-1936 survey was explicit in
its desire to capture the expenditure of rural households, while the 1917-1919 and 1888-1890 selected
almost exclusively on urban households, I used only the urban households from the 1935-1936 survey
in the analysis, which is more than half of the 6,000 observations. For the estimates of CPI bias, I
used the rural data as well, although due to missing values this added only 116 households from rural
areas from the 1935-1936 survey and does not e¤ect the CPI bias results.
Construction of household size in each survey was complicated by the fact that households include
a non-negligible number of boarders. All of the results presented in the paper include boarders as
household members. This could potentially bias the results, but in estimating the e¤ect of household
size on demand with and without boarders the qualitative results were the same, and the estimates of
CPI bias (baseline compared to household change corrected) are similar. Construction of household
expenditure for the three surveys was similar. While the construction of the clothing and food
categories was straightforward, entertainment varies somewhat by survey. Entertainment in 18881890 is comprised of expenditures on books, newspapers, vacations, and "other amusements." For
1917-1919 entertainment includes expenditures on movies, concerts, plays, lectures, dances, billiards,
excursions, books, and "other amusements." For 1935-1936 entertainment includes movies, radios,
sports clubs, social clubs, camping, …shing, hiking, sports (golf, baseball, horseback riding, tennis,
etc.), bikes, skates, skis, billiards, boats, cameras, vacations, and "other recreational expenses." For
more on the di¢ culties of constructing time-invariant measures of entertainment, see Costa (1999).

Price Indices

Overall price change for 1888-1917 and overall and food price changes for 1917-1935 were calculated
from the Historical Statistics of the United States, Millennial Edition (2006). For 1917-35, regional
price indices were calculated using the Handbook of Labor Statistics: 1950 Edition (U.S. Bureau of the
Census 1951) which contains price indices for 1917-1935 for food and all items for a sampling of cities
in the United States. These were applied to the states from which the prices came, to construct a
regional price index using the Census Bureau’s regions (this gives four regions for the US). Assuming
that the price index is a weighted average of food and non-food, the price indices are used to create
regional price indexes for food, non-food and all items for 1917-1935.

Note:
The dependent variable in all regressions is the share of household expenditure devoted to clothing.
Robust t-statistics are listed under coefficient estimates in parentheses. The regressions above include
relative price changes between food and non-food (by region), deflated household expenditure (by region),
regional dummies, household demographics, and the fraction of the household employed.
Regressions are weighted by population size of the US to control for sample size differences (as in Costa
(2001)).
Full demographic * time interaction are regressions where each household share is interacted with
the "Year is 19XX" time variable.
See section 3 of the text for details on the functional form in the CPI bias regression.
