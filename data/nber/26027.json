    "abstract": "\n\nI analyze skill\u2019s role in active management under general equilibrium with many assets and costly trading. More-skilled managers produce larger expected total investment pro\ufb01ts, and their portfolio weights correlate more highly with assets\u2019 future returns. Becoming more skilled, however, can reduce a manager\u2019s expected pro\ufb01t if enough other managers also become more skilled. The greater skill allows those managers to identify pro\ufb01t opportunities more accurately, but active management in aggregate then corrects prices more, shrinking the pro\ufb01ts those opportunities o\ufb00er. The latter e\ufb00ect can dominate in a setting consistent with numerous empirical properties of active management and stock returns.\n\n",
