    "abstract": "\n\nDiscrimination against women has been alleged in hiring practices for many occupations, but it is extremely difficult to demonstrate sex-biased hiring.  A change in the way symphony orchestras recruit musicians provides an unusual way to test for sex-biased hiring.  To overcome possible biases in hiring, most orchestras revised their audition policies in the 1970s and 1980s.  A major change involved the use of  blind' auditions with a  screen' to conceal the identity of the candidate from the jury.  Female musicians in the top five symphony orchestras in the United States were less than 5% of all players in 1970 but are 25% today.  We ask whether women were more likely to be advanced and/or hired with the use of  blind' auditions.  Using data from actual auditions in an individual fixed-effects framework, we find that the screen increases   by 50%   the probability a woman will be advanced out of certain preliminary rounds.  The screen also enhances, by severalfold, the likelihood a female contestant will be the winner in the final round.  Using data on orchestra personnel, the switch to  blind' auditions can explain between 30% and 55% of the increase in the proportion female among new hires and between 25% and 46% of the increase in the percentage female in the orchestras since 1970.\n\n",
