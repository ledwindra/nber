A New Index of Debt Sustainability
Olivier J. Blanchard and Mitali Das
NBER Working Paper No. 24068
November 2017
JEL No. F32,F34
ABSTRACT
Debt sustainability is fundamentally a probabilistic concept: Debt is rarely sustainable with
probability one. We propose an index of external debt sustainability that reflects this uncertainty.
Namely we construct the index as the probability that, at the current exchange rate, net external
debt is equal to or less than the present value of net exports. Constructing this index involves
three steps: (1) deriving the distribution of the present value of net exports at the current
exchange rate; (2) deriving the distribution of exchange rates associated with the condition that,
for each realization, the present discounted value of net exports is at least equal to the value of
current net debt; and (3) assessing where the current exchange rate stands in the distribution of
exchange rates and thus the probability that debt is sustainable. Having shown how this can be
done, we then compute the index for two countries, the United States and Chile. Our main
conclusion is the large degree of uncertainty implied by the presence of large gross asset and
liability positions, together with uncertainty about rates of return on these assets and liabilities.
The size of the distribution of exchange rate adjustments implies that one should be careful in
concluding that debt is or is not sustainable at the current exchange rate and that strong measures
are potentially needed to reestablish sustainability. Exchange rates that appear overvalued in the
baseline may still imply a reasonably high probability that debt is sustainable at the current
exchange rate; symmetrically, exchange rates that appear undervalued in the baseline may still
come with a reasonably low probability that debt is unsustainable at the current exchange rate.

Debt is said to be sustainable if the borrower can service it now and in the future.
In the case of the external debt of a country, this is often stated as: External debt
is sustainable if net debt today is less than or equal to the present value of net
exports.1
This definition however falls short of the mark in two ways:
• The first is that the present value of net exports is a random variable. For
very bad outcomes, it is likely that the condition above will not be met. This
implies that sustainability must be a probabilistic statement, for example, a
high probability that the condition above will be met.
• The second is that net exports, as well as the value of net debt, depend on
the exchange rate, and that, except in pathological cases (when a depreciation
increases net debt more than it increases the present value of net exports),
there is always an exchange rate depreciation that makes debt sustainable.
This suggests the following definition: External debt is sustainable if there is a
high enough probability that, at the current exchange rate, net debt is equal to or
less than the present value of net exports.
This is the definition we start from in this paper. Our goal is to construct a
corresponding index of sustainability, defined as the probability that, at the current
exchange rate, net debt is equal to or less than the present value of net exports.
To do so requires three steps:
• Deriving the distribution of the present value of net exports at the current
exchange rate.
• Deriving the distribution of exchange rates associated with the condition that,
for each realization, the present discounted value of net exports is at least equal
to the value of current net debt;
• Assessing where the current exchange rate stands in the distribution of exchange rates, and thus the probability that debt is sustainable.
As will be clear, the construction of such an index raises a number of conceptual
and empirical issues. Our approach to the various trade-offs is to propose an index
that can be easily constructed based on existing data and available forecasts, and
may for example be used by the IMF country desks in their assessment of a country’s
external position.
1

So if the country is a net debtor, trade surpluses must be large enough. If the country is a
net creditor, trade deficits must be small enough. Note that sustainability is a necessary but not
a sufficient condition for optimality. For example, a positive net asset position together with a
positive present value of trade surpluses imply that debt is sustainable, but not necessarily optimal.

1

The paper is organized as follows.
Section 1 goes through the basic derivation under the assumption of certainty
and identical rates of return for assets and liabilities. Section 2 discusses a first
complication, the fact that the relevant discount factor may sometimes be greater
than one. Section 3 discusses a second complication, the fact that the rates of
return on assets and liabilities can be quite different. Section 4 discusses how to
introduce uncertainty about net exports and rates of return. Section 5 applies the
methodology to the United States. Section 6 applies it to Chile. Section 7 concludes.

1

The basic derivation

Assume that external debt accumulation is given by:
Dt+1 = (1 + rt )Dt − N Xt

(1)

where Dt is net debt at the beginning of period t, N Xt is net exports in period t,
and rt is the real interest rate from t to to t + 1
Solving forward recursively gives:
j
n Y
n
X
Y
−1
Dt =
( (1 + rt+i ) ) N Xt+j + ( (1 + rt+i )−1 ) Dt+n+1
j=0 i=0

(2)

i=0

Or, in terms of ratios to GDP:

dt =

j
n Y
n
X
Y
1 + gt+i
1 + gt+i
nxt+j +
dt+n+1
1 + rt+i
1 + rt+i
j=0 i=0

(3)

i=0

where d denotes the ratio of external debt to GDP, nx denotes the ratio of net
exports to GDP, and g denotes the rate of growth of GDP.
The condition that the ratio of debt to GDP does not explode implies that the
last term must be non positive as n tends to ∞, so:
dt ≤

j
∞ Y
X
1 + gt+i
nxt+j
1 + rt+i

(4)

j=0 i=0

Sustainability requires that the ratio of net debt to GDP be equal to or less
than the present value of the ratio of net exports to GDP. (For simplicity, we shall
continue to refer in what follows to nx as ”net exports” (rather than the ratio of
net exports to GDP), and to d as ”net debt” (rather than the ratio of net debt to
GDP))
As of time t, future values of both nx, r and g are random variables, and so, by

2

implication, is the present value of net exports. Suppose for the moment that we actually knew with certainty both future values of nx conditional on the exchange rate
remaining at its current level, and future values of r and g. Then, the computation
of sustainability would be straightforward. We would:
• Compute the present value of net exports. If it exceeded net debt, we would
conclude that external debt was sustainable.
• If, at the current exchange rate, the present value was smaller than net debt,
we would then compute the value of the exchange rate that made the equality
hold. This would require computing the effect of the exchange rate on both
net debt and net exports.2
• The answer would then be a simple one. If the inequality held at the current
exchange rate, external debt would be sustainable. Otherwise it would not.
If it did not, the computation would give us the adjustment of the exchange
rate which would make it sustainable.
Under uncertainty however, we will have to compute the exchange rate associated
with each potential realization, and thus obtain a distribution of exchange rates.
The comparison will be not between two exchange rates, but between the current
exchange rate and this distribution. Before we get there, we have however to deal
with a number of complications, to which we now turn.

2

Discount Factors

A major issue in constructing the present value of net exports is the choice of the
discount factor (1 + g)/(1 + r). A simple computation will make the point. Using
historical averages of annual growth rates and rates of return on liabilities for 24
countries over various periods (depending on data availability) yields a discount
factor between 0.95 and 1.05, with 3 countries having a discount factor equal to or
above one (see Appendix Table 1). Using instead rates of return on assets yields
a discount factor between 0.96 and 1.09, with 9 countries having a discount factor
equal or above 1.0. This raises both conceptual and empirical issues.
The conceptual issue is clear. A discount factor above 1 implies that debt is
automatically sustainable: For any arbitrary level of net exports, net debt eventually
reaches a constant value, positive if net exports are positive, negative otherwise.
2

Note the analogy with the determination of the price level in the fiscal theory of the price level
(Cochrane 2001). In that theory, sustainability of government debt requires that the price level be
such that real government debt is less or equal to the present value of primary surpluses.

3

One may however conclude that a discount factor permanently above 1 is unlikely, so that sustainability is still potentially an issue.3 What is clear however is
that, even if below 1, the discount factor may be close to 1. This implies that net
exports far in the future get a substantial weight in the present value computation.
To the extent that we do not have such far ahead forecasts, and indeed have little
confidence about the distant future, this raises an empirical issue.
Faced with these theoretical and empirical issues, we take the following short
cut. We ask what exchange rate is needed to keep debt at some date in the future
equal to or less than debt today. In terms of equation 3, we impose that dt+n+1 = dt ,
so the condition becomes:
j
n
n Y
Y
X
1 + gt+i
1 + gt+i
dt (1 −
) ≤
nxt+j
1 + rt+i
1 + rt+i
i=0

(5)

j=0 i=0

Note that if nx, g, r were to be constant in the future, the exchange rate which
satisfied equation (5) would be the same as that which satisfies equation (3). Otherwise, if for example a major change in net exports is likely to happen after time
n, the two will differ. Also, our modified index will come with a tighter distribution
of exchange rates than the index implied by (3), and this is an important warning
about the interpretation of the index later. We see however no way to avoid such a
shortcut.4
What should n be? Ideally it should be as high as we have informed forecasts for.
The required forecasts are available from the World Economic Outlook (WEO)for
up to 5 years ahead. By then, much of the cyclical movement in net exports is likely
to be gone. This suggests using n = 5, and this is what we do later.

3

Different rates of return on assets and liabilities

We have derived the conditions above under the assumption that the rates of return
on assets and liabilities were the same so we could just look at net debt. If however,
the two rates are different, the composition of net debt between assets and liabilities
matters, a point emphasized in a number of recent papers (Gourinchas and Rey
2013). And indeed, the evidence is that the two rates are often different. The
United States typically pays a much lower rate on its liabilities than it receives on
3
This sweeps under the rug a number of relevant issues, namely whether an average interest rate
on debt lower than the average growth rate is sufficient to allow for Ponzi schemes, in which debt
can be issued and never repaid. For a discussion of these issues in the context of domestic public
debt, see Blanchard and Weil (2001)
4
A straightforward alternative would be to require that debt at some date does not exceed some
level d∗ , chosen on the basis of other considerations. In its macroeconomic imbalance procedure,
the European Union for example uses a value of d∗ of 35% as a trigger to assess whether a member
is in a situation of “excess macroeconomic imbalances”.

4

its assets, and is thus able to limit the increase in debt while running a trade deficit.
Some emerging market countries are in the opposite situation (see Appendix Table
1). For example, the difference between the average rate of return on liabilities and
the average rate of return on assets was 5.2 % for Russia, 3.8% for Malaysia, 2.9%
for Thailand; by contrast, the average difference was -1.1% for the United States,
-1.7% for Japan.56
Given often large gross asset and liability positions, these differences in rates
can play an important role in debt dynamics. Thus, we extend our earlier condition
to take these differences into account. Let A and L denote gross assets and gross
liabilities respectively, so that net debt is equal to D = L − A. Let rA and rL be
the rates on gross assets and gross liabilities respectively. Debt dynamics are now
given by:
Lt+1 − At+1 = (1 + rL t)Lt − (1 + rAt )At − N Xt

(6)

which can be rewritten as:
Lt+1 − At+1 = (1 + rLt )(Lt − At ) − (rAt − rLt )At − N Xt

(7)

Or equivalently
Dt+1 = (1 + rLt )Dt − [N Xt + (rAt − rLt )At ]

(8)

The relevant flow, in brackets, is now equal to net exports plus the difference in
rates times the gross asset position. Dividing by GDP, solving forward as before,
and imposing the non-explosion condition gives the following inequality:
j
∞ Y
X
1 + gt+i
dt ≤
[nxt+j + (rAt+j − rLt+j )at+j ]
1 + rLt+i

(9)

j=0 i=0

Sustainability requires that the ratio of net debt to GDP be equal to or less than
the present value of the ratio of net exports to GDP plus the interest differential
times the ratio of gross assets to GDP, denoted by at .7
5

These averages are computed over different periods, reflecting data availability. See appendix
for dates.
6
Here again, these facts raise some difficult conceptual issues, whether these differences between
average rates of return reflect differences in marginal products or differences in risk or in liquidity
across assets. To the extent that they reflect differences in risk, these will be partly reflected in the
stochastic simulations we do below when we introduce uncertainty. Countries with more risky assets
will experience higher rates of return, but also more uncertainty about the evolution of debt over
time. A higher expected rate of return may not imply a higher probability of debt sustainability.
7
Note that we could have rewritten debt dynamics alternatively as Dt+1 = (1 + rAt )Dt − [N Xt +
(rAt − rLt )Lt ], which in turn would have given the following condition:
dt ≤

j
∞ Y
X
1 + gt+i
[nxt+j + (rAt+j − rLt+j )lt+j ]

+ rAt+i
j=0 i=0

dt (1 −

) ≤
[(nxt+j + (rA t+j − rL t+j )at+j ] (10)
1 + rLt+i
1 + rLt+i
i=0

j=0 i=0

Were all the right hand side variables known for certain, the computation of the
index would remain straightforward; the only change is the need to have values for
the ratio of gross assets to GDP, a ratio which is not tied down by the debt dynamics
condition (a given net debt position may correspond to small or large gross asset
and liability positions). But, again, the values of the variables are not known for
certain, and this takes us to the next section, about introducing uncertainty.

4

Uncertainty

Neither future net exports, nor growth, nor rates of return on liabilities and assets,
are known for certain. As a result the present values above are also random variables.
The WEO (or other) forecasts give us the means of the relevant variables but not
their distribution. It seems reasonable, in this context, to treat the WEO forecasts as
the means of the distribution, but to obtain the higher moments from the historical
evidence. Thus, we propose the following approach:
Define the vector X = [nx, g, rL , rA , a]0 , where rL and rA are realized rates of
return on liabilities and assets, excluding the capital gains from changes in the exchange rate (as the computation of the present discounted value is done conceptually
holding the exchange rate constant). Then, one can run the following VAR:8
"

X
e

#

"
=

#
A11 (L) A12 (L)
A21 (L) A22 (L)

"
×

X(−1)
e(−1)

#

"
+

X

#

e

While the VAR gives the joint movements of all variables including the exchange
rate, the forecasts needed to construct the two sides of equation (10) refer to joint
movements of the variables in X assuming a constant exchange rate. These can be
obtained by using the subsystem (and ignoring the Lucas critique, which may well
be relevant in this case):
X = A11 (L)X(−1) + X

(11)

where l is the ratio of gross liabilities to GDP. By construction, and despite the fact that the two
expressions look rather different, with the present values using different discount factors, they are
equivalent.
8
This assumes that one can construct those adjusted rates of return, and that one has long
enough time series and enough degrees of freedom to run the VAR. The two conditions are satisfied
for example for the United States, but not necessarily for other countries. We discuss the issue
further when looking at Chile below.

6

The joint distribution of the variables in X, and by implication the joint distribution of the two sides of equation (10) can then be obtained through stochastic
simulations of equation (11). Just as before, for each realization, one can compute
the exchange rate required to achieve debt sustainability, and obtain the resulting
exchange rate distribution.
Before moving on to applications, we want to note the relation of our index to
two other measures of external debt sustainability.
The first is the measure used by the IMF as part of the CGER exercise (IMF
2006). It differs from our index in four ways. Three of them are minor. The first
is the requirement that debt at some time in the future be equal to debt today,
compared to our assumption that properly discounted debt in the future be equal
to debt today; when the discount factor is close to 1, which it is in practice, this
difference is quantitatively small. The second is in the explicit treatment of rate of
return differentials; this is typically not taken into account in the IMF computation,
except for a few countries. The third is that the adjustment of the exchange rates
affects both the left and right hand side of equation (10); the revaluation of debt,
however, is not taken into account in the CGER. The fourth is the most important,
namely the explicit treatment of uncertainty. Debt is rarely sustainable for sure, or
unsustainable for sure; our index of sustainability gives a more informative signal as
to the state of external debt and the need for an adjustment of the exchange rate.
The second is the index proposed by Martin Evans, (Evans 2012) which pays
careful attention to rate of return differentials, but uses a different set of approximations from ours in order to get a loglinear approximation to equation (10). Again,
the main difference is in our explicit treatment of uncertainty about future returns,
net exports, and growth.

Application to the United States

We now apply our approach first to the United States in this section and to Chile
in the next.
Table 1 gives WEO forecasts for 2017 to 2022, as of the beginning of 2017,
together with the asset and liability positions at the end of 2016.

9

Net debt is forecast to increase from 44% at the end of 2016 to 52% of GDP in
2022. Gross assets are forecast to increase from 129% of GDP at the end of 2016
to 165% of GDP in 2022. Liabilities are forecast to increase from 172% of GDP in
2015 to 217% of GDP in 2022.
The ratio of net exports to GDP is forecast to remain negative, increasing from

3.8% in 2017 to 4.2% in 2022.10 Real GDP growth is forecast to be higher than the
real rate of return on liabilities, implying a discount factor (using rL as in equation
(10) slightly above 1. The rate of return on liabilities is forecast to be lower than
the rate of return on assets, reflecting the large foreign holdings of US government
bonds on the liability side, and the larger share of FDI and portfolio holdings on
the asset side.

Suppose, to start, that these forecasts were held with certainty.
The computation of the two terms in equation (10) would then be straightforward. The present discounted value of the truncated sum of net exports plus the
yield differential times assets (let us call it the ”present value” for short), on the
right hand side, is equal to -14.5%. The corresponding value of net debt times one
minus the relevant discount factor (let us call it “adjusted net debt” for short), on
the left hand side, is equal to -0.6%; note that it is actually negative, despite the fact
that US net debt is positive, because the relevant discount factor is slightly above
1. Thus, if we took the forecasts as holding with certainty, we would conclude that
debt is not sustainable at the current exchange rate.
The next step would to compute the exchange rate which would make it sustainable. The exchange rate affects both the left and the right-hand side of equation
(10):
Starting with the left hand side, computing the effect of the exchange rate on
net debt requires knowing the proportion of gross assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currency. In 2012, which is the most recent date for which data appears
10
We include the secondary income balance (transfers) in net exports. Transfers are, however,
small relative to net exports.

8

to be available (Benetrix et al (2015)), about 68% of US assets were denominated
in foreign currency, while only 16% of US liabilities were denominated in foreign
currency. Assuming that these proportions remained roughly the same at the end
of 2016, and using the numbers in Table 1 for the ratio of assets and liabilities to
GDP, implies that a real depreciation of 10% decreases net debt by about 7% of
GDP.
Turning to the right hand side of equation and using the semi-elasticity of net
exports to the real exchange rate from the IMF’s external balance assessment, a real
depreciation of 10% increases net exports by about 1.5% of GDP.
Putting the two together, the conclusion would be that, as of the beginning
of 2017, and under the assumption that forecasts were held with certainty, debt
sustainability would require a real depreciation of about 9.2%.
We now reintroduce uncertainty and follow the approach developed in the previous section. The variables in the VAR are constructed as follows: nx is net exports
as a ratio to GDP. g is the growth rate of real GDP. Because the ratio of gross
assets and gross liabilities to GDP increases steadily over time, a is defined as the
deviation of the ratio of assets to GDP from a linear trend.11 e is defined as the
real effective exchange rate.
For the rates of return, rA and rL , we consider two alternatives. Conceptually,
one wants to use the realized real rates of return, including capital gains or losses
from changes in asset prices, but not including capital gains or losses due to changes
in the exchange rate—as the forecasts are based, both conceptually and empirically
(for the WEO forecasts), on the assumption of constant exchange rates. What one
can do depends however on data availability. For most countries, one can compute
and use real yields on assets and liabilities, defined as nominal yields minus CPI
inflation, but ignoring all capital gains and losses.12 This is our first alternative.
For the US, one can go further, and construct real yields plus realized capital gains or
losses due to changes in asset prices in their domestic currency.13 This is our second,
and clearly better, alternative. Which alternative is chosen makes a substantial
difference to the results. As shown in Figure 1, the variability of capital gains on US
assets and liabilities far exceeds that of yields, leading to a much wider distribution
of outcomes in simulations below.

11

The use of the deviation of a from trend is only to get a characterization of the second moments
of a. In the construction of the present discounted value of net exports, we use the IMF forecasts
of a, which reflect the trend increase in a, as the baseline.
12
Nominal yields are constructed as the ratio of net investment income (credit or debit) from
BOP data, to corresponding assets or liabilities from IIP data. For emerging market countries,
data on assets and liabilities are often available only from the mid-1990s or later.
13
We found similar information for only one other country, Germany.

We estimate the VAR over 1977-2016 under the first alternative (1976 is the first
year for which data on assets and liabilities are available), and over 1989-2015 under
the second alternative (1989 and 2015 are the first and latest years for which the
decomposition of rates of return is available). The VARs are assumed to be of order

A few correlations stand out: The lower the growth rate, the higher net exports,
reflecting the effect of lower output on imports. Rates of return on assets and
liabilities excluding capital gains are highly correlated; the correlation is lower when
rates of return include capital gains. The tables also show the much larger standard
deviations of rates of return including capital gains, 2.7% for rL and 3.8% for rA when
including capital gains versus 0.6% and 0.6% respectively when they are excluded.

Given the non linearities involved in the present value, rather than solve for the
distributions analytically, we use equation (11) to draw 10,000 realizations under the
assumption of joint normality of the innovations and use the resulting distributions
in what follows.

Figure 2a shows the role of the term reflecting rate of return differentials (rA −
rL ) a in the computation of the present value. It plots the distribution of the present
value either excluding this term (so that the present value is just the present value of
net exports) or including it. In both cases, the rates of return on assets and liabilities
are measured by yields, excluding capital gains. Without the term reflecting rate of
return differentials, the relevant distribution is the distribution to the left, centered
around -26%. With the term reflecting rate of return differentials, the relevant
distribution is the distribution to the right, centered around -15%, reflecting the
fact that, for the United States, the positive net rate of return differentials offset a
large proportion of the trade deficits.

Figure 2b shows the role of the large uncertainty associated with capital gains.
It plots the distribution of the present value using either yields, or yields plus capital
gains, for rA and rL . In both cases, it includes the term reflecting rate of return
differentials in the computation of the present discounted value. The means of the
distribution are roughly similar, but the striking feature is how much larger the
distribution of the present value is when uncertainty about capital gains is taken
into account (as it should). The standard deviation of the distribution increases
from 9% when using yields to 33% when using yields plus capital gains. We see this
result not as a shortcoming of our approach, but as a central fact about the degree
of uncertainty about the future, and by implication about the required adjustment
of the exchange rate. We return to this issue below.
Figure 3 turns to the left hand side of equation (10) and plots the distribution
of the adjusted net debt including or excluding capital gains for rL (rA does not
appear in the formula for net debt). The means of the two distributions are close,
12

-0.9% versus -1.2%. The main feature is again the larger distribution when capital
gains are taken into account. The standard deviation of the distribution is 5.5%
when excluding capital gains versus 6.9% when they are taken into account.

Figures 4a and 4b put the two parts together, and look at the implications for
the exchange rate. For each simulation, using the same elasticities of debt and net
exports to the exchange rate as in the certainty case above, we can compute the
13

exchange rate adjustment such that equation (10) holds as an equality, and report
the distribution.
Figure 4a parallels Figure 2a, showing the role of the term reflecting rate of
return differentials (rA − rL ) a in the computation of the present value. It plots the
distribution of the exchange rate adjustments either excluding this term from the
present value (so that the present value is just the present value of net exports) or
including it. In both cases, the rates of return on assets and liabilities are measured
by yields, excluding capital gains. Including rate of return differentials moves the
distribution to the right, implying a smaller decrease in the exchange rate. The
mean of the distribution is -9.1%, compared to a mean of -16.4% when rate of
return differentials are excluded. The standard deviations of the two distributions
are rather similar, 5.6% and 5.1%.

Figure 4b shows the role of uncertainty associated with capital gains. It plots
the distribution of exchange rate adjustments excluding or including capital gains.
In both cases, it includes the term reflecting rate of return differentials in the computation of the present discounted value. The means of the distribution are roughly
similar, -9.1% and -8.2% (they would be the same is the present value was linear
in the random variables), but the striking feature is again how much larger the distribution of the present value is when uncertainty about capital gains is taken into
account. The standard deviation of the distribution is 5.6% when capital gains are
excluded versus 22.6% when they are taken into account. The probability that the
exchange rate has to depreciate is nearly 100% when excluding capital gains, but
only 64% when they are included.
14

To summarize, we have shown how our index of sustainability can be constructed
using US data. Our conclusion is that, looking at the US economy as of the beginning
of 2017, and assuming forecasts are held with certainty, the mean exchange rate
depreciation needed to maintain debt sustainability is about 8.3%. But, because of
the uncertainty associated with net exports and rates of return, the distribution of
exchange rate adjustments has a large support. The probability that debt is actually
sustainable at the current exchange rate is fairly high, equal in our computation to
36%.

We now use the same methodology to look at an emerging market country, namely
Chile.

Table 3 gives WEO forecasts for 2017 to 2022, as of the beginning of 2017,
together with the asset and liability positions at the end of 2016.
Net debt is forecast to increase from 20% of GDP at the end of 2016 to 25% of
GDP by 2022. Gross assets are forecast to increase from 134% of GDP at the end
of 2016 to 142% of GDP in 2022. Liabilities are forecast to increase from 154% of
GDP at the end of 2016 to 167% of GDP in 2022.
The ratio of net exports to GDP is forecast to be positive, around 2%. In contrast
to the United States, the rate of return on liabilities is forecast to be higher than
the rate of return on assets, reflecting the large foreign holdings of US government
bonds on the asset side, and the larger share of FDI and portfolio holdings on the
liability side.
Suppose again that we held these forecasts with certainty. Going through the

15

same steps as before, the present value is equal to -7.5%, reflecting the fact that
the projected trade surpluses are not sufficient to offset the higher rateof return on
liabilities than on assets. The value of adjusted debt is small, 0.6%, reflecting both
the fact that net debt is small and the discount factor is close to 1. A negative
present value and a positive adjusted debt both imply that the condition given by
equation (10) is not satisfied at the current exchange rate.
The next step is to compute the exchange rate that would satisfy that condition.
Computing the effect of the exchange rate on net debt requires knowing the proportion of gross assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. As of 2012 (data
from Benetrix et al (2015)), nearly all foreign assets were denominated in foreign
currency. About 30% of foreign liabilities were denominated in foreign currency.
Assuming that the proportions have not changed since, and using the numbers in
Table 3 for assets and liabilities, this suggests that a depreciation of the peso of 10%
improves the net debt position of Chile by roughly 8.8% of GDP. Turning to the
present value and using the semi-elasticity of net exports to the real exchange rate
from the IMF’s external balance assessment, a real depreciation of 10% increases
net exports by about 3.0% of GDP. Putting the two together, under the assumption
that forecasts were held with certrainty, the conclusion would be that, as of the
beginning of 2017, debt sustainability required a real depreciation of about 3.2%.
We now reintroduce uncertainty. While data on yields on assets and liabilities
are available, series for rates of return, including capital gains on asset prices but
excluding capital gains coming from movements in exchange rates are not available.
And, as we saw in the previous section, much of the uncertainty about the future
comes from capital gains, and this uncertainty has a large effect on the distribution
of exchange rate adjustments. Thus, we must first construct the relevant series.
We first obtain realized rates of return by computing the change in the value of
assets and liabilities, adjusted for outflows and inflows respectively. Then, using the
approach proposed by Benetrix et al (2015), we compute the change in the value
of assets due to exchange rate movements, and do the same thing for liabilities.
We then subtract these valuation effects from the realized rates of return. (See
Appendix 2).
Figure 5 shows net capital gains from exchange rate changes (in blue) and those
from changes in asset prices (in orange) since 1998. As with the United States,
the variability of net capital gains is significantly larger than that of yields, which
will be reflected in the wider distributions in the simulations below. Note the large
deviations between capital gains from exchange rates and asset prices in 2008 and
2009. In 2008, the large depreciation of the peso caused large capital gains from
exchange rate changes while asset price declines caused large capital losses. The
opposite was observed in 2009, reflecting the large appreciation of the peso and a

16

recovery of asset prices.

The next step is to construct the VAR. Because we have a short sample for some
of the variables, we run two restricted VARs. To capture the correlation between
net exports and growth, we run a VAR of order 1 in nx, g, using data from 1980 on.
To capture the correlation between the rates of return on assets and on liabilities,
we run a VAR of order 1 in rL , rA , a, e, using data from 1998 on. (One may want to
keep 2008 and 2009 or leave them out on the assumption that they were sui generis,
and a similar crisis is unlikely in the future. We leave them out. Leaving them in
increases the standard deviations of the residuals for rL and rA but does not make
a major difference to the conclusions below.) We then use the covariance matrix of
the innovations from the two VARs for our simulations.15
The correlation matrix is given in Table 4. Note the large negative correlation
between nx and g innovations, reflecting the effect of output on imports. Note also
that the standard deviations of the residuals for rA and rL are about 50% larger
than those for the United States

15
This amounts to running one VAR with zero restrictions on some of the off-diagonal elements
of the matrix A11 .

We can then go through the same steps as we did for the United States. We just
present the two final figures giving the distribution of the exchange rate adjustments,
corresponding to figures 4a and 4b for the United States earlier.
Figure 6a shows the role of the term reflecting rate of return differentials (rA −
rL )a in the computation of the present value. It plots the distribution of the exchange rate adjustments either excluding this term from the present value (so that
the present value is just the present value of net exports) or including it. In both
cases, the rates of return on assets and liabilities are measured by yields, excluding
capital gains. In contrast to the United States, including rate of return differentials moves the distribution to the left, implying a larger decrease in the exchange
18

rate. The mean of the distribution is an appreciation of 4.2% when rates of return
differentials are excluded, compared to a depreciation of 2.7% when rate of return
differentials are included. The difference reflects the fact that Chile has large gross
asset and liability positions, and pays a higher rate on average on its liabilities than
it receives on its assets.

Figure 6b shows the role of uncertainty associated with capital gains. It plots the
distribution of exchange rate adjustments excluding or including capital gains for
rA and rL . In both cases, it includes the term reflecting rate of return differentials
in the computation of the present discounted value. The means of the distribution
are close, -2.7% and 0.9%, but the striking feature is again how much larger the
distribution of the present value is when uncertainty about capital gains is taken into
account. The standard deviation of the distribution is 5.3% when excluding capital
gains versus 31.0% when they are taken into account. The probability that the
exchange rate has to depreciate is 69% when capital gains are not taken into account,
but 49% when they are (reflecting the fact that the support of the distribution is so
wide as to make it nearly uninformative).
We draw two conclusions from this examination of Chile, and they parallel those
obtained for the United States:
First, just looking at trade balances may be misleading and one has to look at
rate of return differentials. In the case of Chile, as opposed to the case of the United
States, negative rate of return differentials yield a more negative assessment of the
required exchange rate adjustment.
19

Second, and to our mind, most importantly, the uncertainty associated with
realized rates of return implies a very large distribution of required exchange rate
adjustments. Even if forecasts imply that, ignoring uncertainty, debt is unsustainable at the current exchange rate, the probability that a downward adjustment of
the exchange rate will be required can be substantially less than one. In the case
of Chile, while baseline numbers suggest the need for a (small) depreciation, the
probability that the exchange rate has to depreciate is only 49%.

Remarks and conclusions

Our paper makes two contributions.
The first is methodological. We propose a new index of debt sustainability,
namely the probability that debt is sustainable at the current exchange rate. We
show how to take into account both the role of differential rates of return on assets and liabilities, as well as the implications of uncertainty, in determining this
probability.

The second is empirical. We show how much both dimensions matter. One
major fact about today’s world is the size of the gross liability and asset positions
relative to the net debt position. These, together with large variations in rates of
20

return on these assets and liabilities, imply substantial uncertainty about whether
debt is sustainable or not. This is best illustrated by considering a counterfactual
experiment, in which we assume that U.S. gross and net liability positions are the
same. Specifically, we assume that US gross liabilities are 44% of GDP, gross assets
are equal to zero, and so net debt is 44%, as it is in Table 1. The counterfactual
distribution of exchange rate adjustments is given by the distribution in green in
Figure 7. The actual distribution, repeated from Figure 4b, is shown in red. It shows
the dramatic increase in the support of the distribution going from the counterfactual
to the actual distribution, the difference being due to the size of the gross positions
relative to the net position. In the counterfactual distribution, the probability that
the exchange rate must depreciate is nearly 100%. Given the large gross positions,
the probability decreases to 64%.
We have stayed away from policy implications. Our results make it clear that
debt sustainability depends much more on shocks to the capital account than to
shocks to the current account.16 Given a ratio of assets to GDP of nearly 150% as
in the case of Chile, a one-standard deviation shock to the rate of return on assets
of 5.3% moves debt by 8% of GDP, overwhelming likely movements in the trade
balance. Put another way, dramatic measures taken to adjust the trade balance
may only move the probabilities a bit, and any adjustment in the trade balance can
easily be offset by capital gains or losses on gross assets and liabilities. This does not
mean that governments should ignore trade deficits, but they should be aware that
trade balance adjustments, which maybe potentially painful, may well be swamped
by capital account shocks.

16

This echoes the theme developed by Obstfeld (2012).

Appendix 2

Following Benetrix (2012), this appendix shows how to approximate realized returns
on foreign assets and foreign liabilities excluding capital gains from movements in
exchange rates. The steps are described for returns on foreign assets; they are the
same for foreign liabilities.
Realized rates of returns (yield plus capital gains) on foreign assets are given by:
rAt = (IAt + KGAt )/At−1
where IA and KGA are respectively the investment income and capital gains
realized on the existing stock of assets. Capital gains realized between the end of
year t − 1 and the end of year t are given by:
KGAt = At − At−1 − KOt
where KOt are capital outflows (or net acquisition of assets) during t. All
variables are measured in local currency.
Realized capital gains on foreign assets reflect both changes in asset prices,
KGAP , and changes in exchange rates, KGAE . We compute KGAE as follows:
Let the share of assets denominated in foreign currency i at the end of year t be
P
denoted by ωit . And let αt = ni=1 ωit be the overall share of assets denominated
in foreign currency.
Denote by ∆eit the rate of change of the ith bilateral exchange rate from the
end of year t − 1 to the end of year t (∆e > 0 is a depreciation), and define the
weighted rate of change of the exchange rate as:
∆et =

n
X

ωit−1 ∆eit

i=1
E
We then approximate KGAE
t by KGAt = αt−1 At−1 ∆et , and subtract it from

KGAt to obtain KGAPt .
