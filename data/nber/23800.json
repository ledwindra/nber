    "abstract": "\n\nWe assess how the African slave trade\u2014which had enduring effects on social cohesion\u2014continues to influence financial systems. After showing that the intensity with which people were enslaved and exported from Africa during the 1400 \u2013 1900 period helps account for overall financial development, household access to credit, and firm access to finance, we evaluate three potential mechanisms linking the slave trade to modern finance\u2014information sharing institutions, trust in financial institutions, and the quality of legal institutions. We discover that the slave trade is strongly, negatively related to the information sharing and trust mechanisms but not to the legal mechanism.\n\n",
