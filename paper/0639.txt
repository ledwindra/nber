Nested Tests of Alternative Term—Structure Theories

ABSTRACT

Controversies in term—structure theory center around the existence and

variability of term premia in securities yields. In this paper, the term
premium
its

on a default—free n—period bond

observable

is defined as the difference between

yield to maturity and the average expected per—annum rate of

return on an n—period strip of rollover investments in one—period bonds. To

alternative term—structure theories without introducing ex post proxies
for expectational variables, this paper uses a set of cross—section interest—
test

rate

forecasts collected jointly with Burton Malkiel of

from a
single

Princeton

University

population of large institutional lenders at four different phases of a

interest—rate cycle. Statistical tests strongly confirm the existence

of nonzero term premia at each survey date, thereby rejecting the pure—
expectations theory of the term structure. Additional tests are unable

to

reject restrictions implied by the liquidity—premium hypothesis that term
premia should be positive and increase with

maturity. Finally, contrary to

the martingale hypothesis, ex ante term—premium data vary significantly over
time and show a positive association with the level of interest rates.

NITED TFSFS OF ALTERNATIVE

ThRM—STRUC'1JRE TREORIES*

Edward J. Kane**

Traditional theories of the term structure of interest rates

may be interpret-

ed as arbitrage theories of equilibrium bond prices (Malkiel,
1962). Of course,
unless explicit forward, futures, and spot markets for bonds
are complete in
themselves, the arbitrage pressure takes place in the subjective
space of participant expectations rather than in the objective space of observed bond
prices.
Arbitrage theories are necessarily

efficient—markets theories, inasmuch as wasted

information would in itself raise

opportunities for arbitrage (Ross, 1977). Alternative term—structure theories differ in their views of: (1) the

specific contractu
elements of a long-term bond contract that the market must
price, and (2) the
forecastability of short-run movements in long—term interest rates.

Translated to the conventional

interest-rate metric, controversies in term-

structure theory revolve about the existence and variability of term
premia in
market yields. A term premium, T, may be defined for
every finite term-to-.
maturity, n, where n=1,2,3
Each T is the difference between the observable
yield on n-period bonds and the

average expected per-annum rate of return on an nperiod strip of rollover investments in one-period bonds. From the
perspective of
modern finance, term premia are best conceived as
"market-completion premia"

(Kane, 1980). They are algebraic transforms of the net price of whatever
package

2

of services (e.g., of providing guarantees or accepting specific portfolio risks) is
deemed necessary to "complete" bond markets. In suggesting that term premia be

interpreted as equilibrating allowances necessary to compensate marginal lenders

or borrowers for the extra service of holding or issuing debt whose terms-to—
maturity are longer or shorter than their preferred maturity "habitats," Modigliani
and Sutch (1966) offer an almost equally broad interpretation.

Requirements for market completeness provide an intuitive justification for

expecting positive term premia to exist. This paper presents a series of empirical

tests that confirm the existence and variability of positive term premia in the
market for U.S. Treasury securities. These tests comçre market yields on longterm securities with cross-section forecasts of future interest rates collected at
four different survey dates.

I. Alternative Term-Structure Hypotheses

With respect to the existence of term premia, the most restrictive theory is
the pure-expectations theory, PET (Lutz, 1940). According to the PET, investors'

expectations of future short rates completely explain the differential between
short and long rates. Because additional market-completion services are not
needed, term premia are identically zero. The alternative hypothesis to PET is
tat unspecified market—completion "rvices are required, so that nonzero term
premia exist. As portrayed it Figure One's Venn diagram, this alternative
hypothesis — which we dub term-premium theory (TPT) — is itself an aggregation

of several narrower hypotheses, each of which assigns the task of completing bond

markets to a disparate set of borrower or lender services. Different versions of
TPT may be developed intuitively from PET by relaxing differentially various of its

restrictive assumptions. The least-restrictive versions of TPT may be called
unconstrained-premium theories (UPT), since in the absence of extraneous informa-

3

tion they place no restrictions on the signs or relative magnitudes of the term
premia observable in different maturity sectors. UPT interprets term premia

either as risk premia (e.g., Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross, 1978) or as habitatdisplacement allowances (Modigliani and Sutch, 1966). Within TPT, alternative

hypotheses to UPT may be divided into the Hicksian
(LPT) and other Constrained-premium theories

liquidity-premium theory

(OCPT). LPT requires term premia

to be positive and to increase with maturity in a monotonically nondecreasing
manner. OCPT covers the possibility that only one of the two LPT restrictions

holds. From the point of view of statistical testing, OCPT is merely a logical
alternative to LPT and UPT, not a fully interpreted prior hypothesis.
Term—premium theories also concern themselves with explaining the behavior

of term premia over time. The hypothesis of time-invariant term premia
plays a
pivotal role in rnartingale theorists' attempts to denigrate traditional theories of
the term structure. Several studies exploring restrictions that forecast rationality
and market efficiency place on the joint processses of expectations formation and

term—structure arbitrage have attempted to repudiate the expectations—based
approach. These authors (e.g., Phillips and Piggenger, 1979) take the position that

short-run movements in long-term interest rates are so nearly random as to be
intrinsically unforecastable. The evidence reported here shows that term prernia

vary over time in systematic ways. Systematic variation shifts the burden of
Occam's Razor argumentation back onto critics of the traditional
approach, since
it suggests that the approximation (Sargent, 1976) involved in the
martingale

approach is conceptually deficient (Fama, 1976; Pesando, 1979).
II. Derivations and Underlying Concepts
Notation

Traditional term-structure theory focuses on single-payment securities, uncomplicated by default risk or special features of any kind. The unit price,

of

4
a

security that matures in n periods is the discounted preseri t value of a dollar at

the maturity date. We find this value by discounting this future dollar n times at
Rat, the yield to maturity for an n-period bond:

1/(1 +

Rt), for n

1,2,3,.

(1)

In this discrete-time conception, the term to maturity of any bond bounds a set of

n unit maturities. We presume that the "unit maturity" is a minimum period for
economical investment in open-market securities. Our empirical work treats this
interval as the calendar quarter and takes Rit as exogenous.
PET Bond-Pricing Framework

Alternative expectations-based theories of the term structure disagree as to
what basis elements span the space of bond prices. According to PET, logarithms

of current and expected bond prices lie in a linear vector space. The equilibrium
price of every long-term security is the product of the prices of any combination of

spot and forward transactions in shorter bonds that spans the same term-to—
rnLturity. The most convenient basis elements for the space of log-prices are the
eurrent and expected intervening future kg-prices of one—period bonds (or "bills").
The familiar PET equilibrium condition expresses precisely this linear dependence.

To derive testable implications from the PET condition, it is convenient to

introduce the auxiliary concept of an investment strategy of maturity n. An

investment strategy is an n-tuple, (), that lists, for each of the n component
periods, the maturity in which the present discounted value of each dollar of a
planner's matured portfolio is to be held. Two focal strategies may be identified:
(1) the "unit" or "rollover" strategy, whose entries are all ones, and (2) the "hold—to--

maturity" or 'tfactorial" strategy, whose entries are the successive factors of n—
factorial. In vector notation:

5

The unit strategy: () = (1, 1, 1, ...,

1);

The factorial strategy: (n9 (n, n-i, n—2,...,l).

PET makes an expected future dollar just as valuable as a certain one and

requires, for each and every investment period n, that all feasible investment
strategies (including the factorial strategy) have the same equilibrium price as the

unit strategy,

Clearly,

equals the price of n-period bonds,

We

can factor the price of an n-period unit strategy into the product of the price and

quantity of bills an investor must buy at t to roll over into an expected dollar at

t+n. We let Et(...) represent the expectations operator and leave implicit the
conditioning information that investors use at time t in formulating their expectations of future prices.

It is convenient to proceed recursively. To buy a claim to an expected t+2

dollar via the unity strategy, one must first buy Et(Pit÷i) bills at the price P1.
Putting PitEt(Pi,t+i) in bills at t promises to produce Et(Pi,t+i) dollars at t+i. On
an expected—value basis, the proceeds may be rolled over into just—enough t+i bills

to produce an expected dollar at t+2. Since all 2—period investment strategies must

sell at the same price, Pt(12), which equals PitEt(Pit+i), must also equal the price
of two—period bonds.

Similarly, the price of the three-period unit strategy may be expressed in
terms of the price of two-period bonds and the number of them one must purchase
today to be able to acquire Et(P1,t+2) worth of bills at t+2. Summarizing, we have

established that:

2t =

= PitEt(Pi,t+i);

(2a)

6

3t =

t!3

P2tEt(Pit÷2)

(2b)

Substituting from (2a) into (2b), we obtain (2c):

3

3t =

P2tEt(Pit÷2) lt k=2 Et(Pl,t+k_l) •

(2c)

For arbitrary n, this equation easily generalizes into:
=

Pt

=

P_i,

Et(Pi,t÷_1) = P1

k2 Et(Pl,t+k_l), n=2,3,...

(2d)

Term Premja

Term premia are defined in the interest-rate metric. T is the difference
between the yield to maturity on an n-period bond and the expected per-annum
yield on the unit strategy:

T=

—1/n

—1/n

n=2,3,...

(3)

T1 is zero by construction, while equation (2d) assures us that all term premia
equal zero under PET.
Term-Premium Theory (TPT)

According to TPT, transactions costs and maturity preferences prevent
factorial and unit strategies from

being equivalent portfolios, either for borrowers

or for lenders.

However, a number of conceptually distinct microeconomic
explanations exist as to what accounts for this nonequivalence: Hicks (1946);
Green (1967); Hirshleifer (1972); Kane (1980); Modigliani and Sutch (1966);

7

McCulloch (1973); Roberts (1980); Roll (1971); Stiglitz (1970); Tuttle, Lee, and
Maness (1978). All versions agree in postulating that for each possible investment

period the anticipated price of an investment strategy must vary not only with the

length of the holding period n, but potentially with the maturity of every
component in the strategy chosen.
Liquidity-Premium Theory (LPT)

Under the liquidity-premium theory (LPT), for any holding period n, the
maximum price is paid for the unit strategy. By investing in a succession of one-

period securities, an investor momentarily liquidates his investments at the
beginning of every component period. When transactions costs are nonzero, this
gives him the option of responding cheaply to new information (e.g., to unfolding

rates of unanticipated inflation). To give up this flexibility in favor of holding in
any component period a k-period security (where k >

1),an

investor must receive a

positive premium in yield, Lk. Moreover, because a bond's liquidity may be
presumed to decrease with its maturity, Lk must increase (or at least not decrease)
with k.

Under LPT, the ex ante yield on any n-period strategy, R(), increases
monotonically with a ceteris paribus increase in any element of the investment-

strategy vector .

R() includes a specific liquidity premium to compensate

investors for each and every component-period departure from the unit strategy.
Letting arithmetic averaging of component-period yields approximate the compli-

cated geometric averaging envisaged in equations (2a) to (2d), we can establish

that:

T2 = L2/2

(4a)

T3 = (L3 + L2)/3

(4b)

8

= L + jfl_ 1'n-2 +...+ L2

=

L

4-

(n-i);

.

(4)

Properties of the average-marginal relationship assure us that LPT restric-

tions on the Lk carry through to the T0. If every Lk is positive, so must every T

be.

Even in the limiting LPT case where all Lk would have exactly the same value,

the T would still increase with maturity.
Variability of

over Time

Panel A of Table 1 summarizes the implications of alternative term—structure

theories for term premia.

Panel B indicates that. disagreement also exists

concerning the sign of the effect that interest rates might have on term premia.

Briefly, Kessel and Cagan portray the Tk as payments made to compensate
for the imperfect moneyness of bonds. Bonds are imperfect substitutes for money
and bills. Since the opportunity cost of increased moneyness is forgone yield, they
hypothesize that lack-of-moneyness allowances should increase with market inter-

est rates. Van Home and Nelson depict the Tk instead as payments made to offset
expected capital losses. Making expected changes in any bond price proportional to

the difference between its current interest rate and its expected long-run average

(r "normal") level, they derive a negative relation between current rates and the

expected capital losses their Tk are supposed to offset. Subsequent research by
Pesando (1975) and Friedman (1979) have affirmed the Kessel-Cagan hypothesis.

With Rt directly entering the calculation (3) of T , additional tests are desirable
because measurement error in distributed-lag proxies for R(1) could easily bias
the results toward positive association.

It is also important to investigate the logically prior hypothesis that term
premia do not vary over time at all. As the following stylized theorems indicate,

9

the assumption that term premia are time-invariant plays a pivotal role in
martingale representations of the term structure:
1. In the absence of time—varying term premia, market efficiency
requires that long-term interest rates follow a random walk or
martingale sequence if short—term rates do (Sargent, 1976).

2. Even if short-term rates do not follow a random-walk (and the

predictability of Federal Reserve reactions to business and
electoral cycles provides strong reason to believe that U.S.
short rates do not), as long as term premia are time-invariant,
long-term interest rates may still be well approximated by a
martingale (Sargent, 1976).

3. On the other hand, if term premia can be shown to vary over
time in systematic ways, the approximation involved in the
martingale approach must be viewed as conceptually deficient

(Pesando, 1980).

III. The Kane-Ma]kiel Survey Data

To explain the data set, it is necessary to emphasize the difficulty of
confronting term-structure theories with time—series data. The focal issue is not

whether "soft" survey data sets are as good as "hard" time-series evidence. The
issue is how well cx

measurements

can approximate cx ante forecasts. Term-

structure theories contemplate an unobservable experiment.

Proper experimentation would develop information on expectational variables that are not
recorded in market transactions. Substituting cx
proxy variables whose
relevance depends on the validity of untested auxiliary hypotheses about expecta-

tions formation loosens scientific rules of evidence. Even worse, because term

premia are estimated as residuals and interest rates are serially correlated,
commonly used distributed-lag proxies for expectations make it doubly hard to test

for the effect of interest rates on term premia.

Instead of experimental

observations collected systematically, researchers apply untested assumptions to

accounting data to generate numbers that are interpreted as "observations" on
R(1), the expected holding-period return on the n-period unit strategy.

10

The Kane-Malkiel surveys were conceived as away to test term—structure
theory on its own terms. We collected from the population of institutional lenders

ex ante data on the expectational variables the iieory manipulates. Although the
individuaLs that fill out our questionnaires are not observed in the experimental act

of buying or selling securities, we Jirected our questionnaires to firms likely to be

active in securities markets and to individuals within these firms whose job-titles
suggest that they would conceive or execute securities transactions. Although the

artificiality of the reporting context is an inescapable source of measurement
error, at the very least, our data provide an opportunity to covalidate time-series
results.

Data are presented for each of our last four survey dates: January 1969,
July 1969, October 1970, and January 1972. These dates were chosen in part to
sample different phases of the interest-rate cycle to let us investigate hypotheses

about the effect of interest rates on term premia. Two earlier surveys (April 1965

and January 1966) are ignored here because we had not yet honed our survey
instrument to develop R(1) for long holding periods.

We distributed by mail an average of 170 questionnaires at each date.1 An

abbreviated version of the questionnaire is presented as an appendix. Our tests
make use of the data reported in the last column of question 1 and of the first half

of question 3. Holding-period yields are calculated as geometric averages of the
value of the 91-day bill rate on the survey date and relevant forecasts of this rate

at intervening future dates. Answers to questions 4 and 10 were used to develop
subsamples by which to assess the representativeness of the aggregate sample.

11

Representativeness of Respondent Opinion

Representativeness is a central issue in survey research. Our designated
population is the opinion of market participants, weighted by their market activity.

In recognition of this, our surveys focus on large institutional investors: banks,
nonfinancial corporations (NFCs) insurance companies (ICOs: including both life
and casualty companies), and a smattering of securities dealers.2 Treasury surveys

of ownership indicate that firms in these industries owned over 40 percent of the
public marketable Treasury debt outstanding at each survey date.

According to Bierwag and Grove (1967), we would want ideaily to weight
each response by the size of the respondent's portfolio, by the confidence it has in
its estimates, and by its aggressiveness or willingness to commit funds in support of

its forecasts. Question 4 attempts to sidestep this weighting problem by letting us

identify a group of investors who consider themselves in equilibrium at current

yields. We treat their expectations as a norm against which to measure the
representativeness of aggregate—sample results.

Questions 9 and 10 (which we did not develop until the 1972 survey) let us

investigate the extent to which sample subjects are representative of portfolio

decisionmakers ("bosses") at respondent firms. A few interesting differences
emerge between this "boss" group and the rest of the sample.3

Finally, although our response rate averaged well over 65 percent, non—

response bias must be considered.

This bias is best assessed by obtaining

information from nonrespondents. We are fortunate in this respect since (to obtain

information on the summary distributions of respondent forecasts promised as an

incentive to respondents) many nonrespondents wrote us to explain their reasons
for not completing our form. Two principal reasons were cited. First, especially in

the insurance industry, some firms have a strict policy against letting their

12

employees "waste" time completing external questionnaires.

Second, nonre-

spondent NFCs in particular often excused themselves as lacking in current
knowledgeability due to recent nonparticipation

government—securities markets.

Far from being a problem, this second type of nonresponse is better for our
purposes than an ignorant response.
Measuring Yields on U.S. Treasury Securities

To determine a respondent's perceived term premium, Tk, it is necessary to

subtract his forecasted R(lk), from the market yield, Rk. Our calculations use
data on Rk calculated by Salomon Brothers. Salomon Brothers' yield curves are
widely regarded on Wall Street, but for our purposes they have three weaknesses.

First, since they are reported on a semiannual true-yield basis, they are not
immediately comparable to the 3—month Treasury-bill rate forecasts impounded in

our estimates of R(lk). Treasury bills are typically quoted on a bank-discount
basis. Because an unknown number of respondents may have either reported true-

yield figures or based their bank—discount calculations on a 360-day rather than

365-day year, it is not possible to align market yields exactly. For four different

caturities at each survey date, Table 2 presents three alternative sets of market
yields.

Since bank-discount rates are lower than true yields, using them to

calculate term premia is a conservative procedure, biased against finding large

premia. We focused on 365-day yields on the grounds that at least some
respondents were reporting bill rates on a true-yield basis and that 365-day yield
quotations have become more common than 360-day figures. We present the 360-

day yields for anyone who wants to test the sensitivity of our results to this
assumption. 360-day Tk run about four basis points (a basis point is 1/100 of a
percentage point) less than our 365-day estimates.4

Two other sources of measurement error are discussed in Section V. The
effects of variation in the dates on which individual questionnaires were filled out

13

and of distortions in market yields caused by differential taxability are handled in a
post—mortem sensitivity analysis of our principal findings.

IV. Cross-Section Tk and Tests of Alternative Theories
Our cross-section focus lets us address meaningful hypotheses with elemen-

tary statistical tests. In this study, inference is based upon: (1) t-tests of
significant difference of respondents' mean Tk from zero; (2) Mann-Whitney tests

of differences between the means of two samples (t—tests being rendered less
reliable by frequent significant differences in sample variances); (3) binomial tests

focused on the percentage of observed premia that are positive; and (4) rank—
correlation and concordance tests of the influence of interest rates on the level of
term premia.
Evidence for Rejecting PET for TPT

Table 3 summarizes the data used in our first and most important test. For

both the aggregate sample and the maturity—indifferent subsample, the table
presents mean values, measured in basis points, for four premia at each survey
date. For 1972, mean Tk are also calculated separately for the "Boss" subsample of

each group. Four maturities are covered: half-year, one year, two years, and ten
years. Only one of the 32 sample means is not significantly greater than zero. In
the single case (January, 1969 T112) where the mean premium is not significantly

greater than zero, even using 360-day yields, one must also reject the hypothesis

that the premium is significantly less than zero. A near-zero premium is least
damaging to TPT when it attaches to the shortest maturity distinguishable in the
data.5
In 1972, we can focus specifically on a subsample of respondents who make

portfolio decisions for their firms. For this boss group, PET is rejected even more

emphatically. Bosses' mean term premia prove generally higher than those for

14

other respondents.6 These differences are statistically significant in the aggregate
sample, but not in the smaller maturity-indifferent ..ubsample.

Table 4 investigates whether the averege premia reported in Table 3 owe
their significance to a few large outliers. We
investigate this possibility by asking
whether the proportion of respondents reporting a positive term premium significantly exceeds fifty percent. In these tests, the January 1969 T112 continues to be
troublesome, but only one other observation (aggregate-sample T2 in 1972) fails to

produce a ratio significantly larger than fifty percent.
Evidence Affirming LPT and OCPT over PHT

Tables 3 and 4 establish that term premia are generally positive, refuting
the pure-expectatiors theory. In Table 5, we inquire whether term premia increase

significantly with maturity as LPT predicts. Using Occam's Razor, we should be
prepared to neglect institutional information such as the distribution of borrowers'
and lenders' maturity habitats featured in the preferred—habitat theory if both LPT
restrictions are upheld.
By LPT, a longer-maturity term premium always exceeds a shorter one. At

euh date, our data set generates six pairs of premia. In most cases, the longer
premium does significantly exceed the shorter one. In the aggregate sample, only
five of the 24 pairs fail to show a significant difference and a sixth case

(T2 versus

T10 in July 1969) shows countersignificance. (Post-mortem analysis undertaken in
Section V suggests that this anomaly traces to tax bias.) In the focal maturity-

indifferent group, only eight of the twenty-four pairs fail to show a significant
difference and no countersignificant evidence is observed. Within the parallel boss
groups in 1972, the evidence in favor of LPT is much the same.

Behavior of Term Premia over Time

Except for one anomalous observation, Table 5 upholds the monotonically
nondecreasing restriction of LPT, though the gap between two and ten years

15

maturity leaves open the issue of an intermediate peak. Table R tests the
straightforward null hypothesis that at each maturity the term premium is the

same at each survey date. The alternative hypothesis does not specify any
particular pattern of expected differences across dates. Because two-thirds to
three-fourths of the paired premia differ significantly across survey dates, we
reject the null hypothesis (critical to the interpretation of martingale research)
that the premium structure is time-invariant.

This finding sets up our next task: to see if we can explain the changes in
Tk that we observe. Neglecting other potential determinants, we investigate the

relation between term premia and market interest rates. Both for the aggregate
sample and the maturity-indifferent subsample, rank correlations between the Tk
and the k-year yields recorded in Table 2 are strongly positive. Because each such

correlation shows only three degrees of freedom, it is convenient to focus our
significance tests on coefficients of concordance, W (see Siegel, 1956). Concordance calculations let us pool ranks across maturities and survey dates. For both

sample groupings, W is 0.83 (after correcting for a tie in the case of maturity—
indifferent respondents). This value is significant even at the one-percent level.
V. Post-Mortem Analysis
Comparing Cross-Section and Time-Series Premium Estimates

Table 7 collects parallel time-series measurements of term premia. The
upper panel compares McCulloch's (1975a) mean estimates of T112, T1, T2, and T10

during 1951-1966 with the mean values achieved in our surveys. Our cross-section

premia are much higher, but rise proportionately as steeply as McCulloch's values.

Because the generally higher values of the cross-section estimates are drawn from
the higher interest—rate era of 1969-1972, they may be said to reinforce the rank—

correlation evidence in favor of the hypothesis that interest rates impact positively
on term premia.

16

Table 7's second panel develops time—series estirnate for only two premia,
T112 and T1, for dates one month in advance of our first three survey dates. These

are rough figures calculated from worksheets that esando (1975) graciously made
available. The dates are closely enough aligned to support comparison. Pesando's
and our results show similar values for T112 at each date and the lowest values for

both premia occur at the first date. The major differences concern much-lower
time-series estimates of T1, especially on the first two survey dates when they are

below T112 and on one occasion even negative. Lacking standard errors for these

premia, we cannot formally test the significance of these discrepancies, but it is
clear that these data could not reject PHT or OCPT as alternative hypotheses to
LPT.
Allowing for Measurement Error in Yields

Precisely because our approach to measuring term premia is so straight—
forward, it is important to identify potential sources of measurement error and to

discuss whether and how these might affect the qualitative pattern of results
observed.

We have dealt throughout with the danger that respondent forecasts might
not be representative of market opinion. But two other sources of bias remain:
1.

Since questionnaires wee completed at different dates, various respondents' forecasts made use of different information sets.

2. The capital-gains tax preference and 4.25—percent interest ceiling on
coupon bonds combined to bias long—term Treasury yields downward.7

1. Response-Timing Bias. In principle, we want to measure each respondent's
anticipations of yield on alternative unit strategies on the survey date itself. In
practice, it is unreasonable to expect busy executives to complete questionnaires

the moment they receive them. Our mail brought a batch of questionnaires each

17

day for about two and a half weeks after our mailings, with dribs and drabs arriving

even later.
If we adopt the convenient hypothesis that compounded forecast revisions
would be positively related to movements in market rates between the survey date

and the date shown in respondent postmarks,8 Table 8 allows us to make some

rough corrections for differences in the timing of responses. In January 1969,
yields showed little net movement during the months after the survey date. Since
the ten—year yield moved up relatively steadily, R(110) may have been overstated
slightly. Correcting for this would tend to raise T10 above its Table 3 value.

After July, 1969 the ten-year yield was unchanged, but the other yields rose

between 17 and 32 basis points. These movements would tend to raise near-term

yield forecasts, resulting in underestimates of T112, T1, and T2. Correcting for
this would tend to flatten the slope of the term-premium curve and to accentuate
the LPT-refuting decline from T2 and T10.

After October 1, 1970, short yields fell more sharply than ten-year ones.
This would tend to lower near-term forecasts more than distant ones, making our
calculations underestimate October 1 forecasts. Correcting for this would lower

term-premium estimates generally but especially in the short end. This would
steepen the term-premium structure and might drive T112 close to zero.

After January 1, 1972, half-year and one-year rates fell, while longer rates
rose. This suggests that R(1112) and R(11) may have been understated and R(12)
and R(110) overstated. Correcting for this would lower T112 and T1 (possibly to

near-zero levels) while raising T2 and T10. This correction would steepen the
term-premium structure and might very well remove the LPT-refuting decline
between T1 and T2.

In summary, correcting for the timing of responses would steepen the
structure of term premia on three of the four survey dates. It would also lower the

18

mean value ot T112 across surveys, perhaps substantially. Thm the point of view
of LPT, the only di.sconfirming effect is to heighten the July 1969 decline observed

between T2 and T10. However, the next section in'icates that much (if not all) of
this decline reflects tax bias.

2. Tax Bias. Although the Tax Reform Act of 1969 denies this privilege to
financial institutions, price appreciation on U.S. Treasury bonds is generally
treated as a capital gain. Because capital gains are taxed more lightly than coupon
yields, at equal yields a discount security would promise a higher after-tax return.9

If we suppose that the law of one price applies to after-tax holding-period yields,
equilibrium yields to maturity on discount securities ar' systematically understated

(Pye). Because long-term Treasurys sold at substantial discounts at every survey

date (thanks to the 4.25 percent ceiling then allowed on bond coupons), this
understatement of yields biases downward our estimates of

T10.

For ten-year yields, Table 9 provides rough estimates of the size of this bias

at each survey date. The bias should be negligible for the shorter maturities, since
high—coupons securities—and below one-year even Treasury bills—were available.

Using the assumptions stated in the note to the table, tax bias is calculated by
equalizing after-tax running yields on a 4.25-percent coupon issue and a hypotheti-

'al new issue selling at par. Adding only half of this bias to the T10 estimates
reported in Table 3 is enough to wipe out the bothersome decline between T2 and
T10 observed in July 1969.
VI. Summary and Implications

Our cross-section estimates strongly confirm TPT over PET and are unable

to reject the restrictions on term premia implied by LPT. In general, whatever
one's holding period, one can expect to earn more by investing in a long-term
instrument than in a shorter one. This higher expected yield may be interpreted as

19

compensation for the risk and inconvenience to lenders of accepting a long-term
coin iriitrnent.

Statistical tests reject the inartingale—theory hypothesis that term premia

are time-invariant and indicate that observed variation is positively associated
with the level of interest rates.

1The number distributed varied primarily because of respondent requests for
deletion and because of a follow-up focus adopted in the July 1969 and January
1972 surveys (to test theories of expectations revision) that reduced the size of

these mailings.

2Our sampling frame relied heavily on Fortune's "largest" lists. Kane and Malkiel
(1967) explains our procedures in more detail arid reports term premia observed in
our first (April, 1965) survey.

3We also tested the homogeneity of estimated term premia across different classes
of institutions at each survey date. About five percent of institution pairs showed
differences that proved significant at five percent. No differences were significant at one percent.

4We might point out that converting the market yields to a bank-discount basis
requires only sixteen calculations. Converting respondent estimates of R(i) to a
true-yield basis would require almost two—thousand calculations.

5Appendix Table 1 illustrates how term premia are calculated and shows that term
premia average even higher and exhibit much the same qualitative pattern when
the mean bill-rate forecasts are converted to bond yields and subtracted from
continuously compounded yields on hypothetical single-payment bonds.

6Means for nonbosses differ in the opposite direction from the aggregate—sample
means. The latter figures are best interpreted as a weighted average of the means
for the boss and nonboss subsamples.

7Additioal downward bias due to the preponderance of "flower bonds" (those
acceptable at par in payment of federal estate taxes) among long-term Treasury
securities is presumably corrected away in Salomon Brothers' calculations.
8This is the error-learning hypothesis. For evidence, see Meiselman (1962), Malkiel
and Kane (1969), Diller (1969), and Kane (1970).
9See Pye (1965), hobichek and Niebuhr (1970), and MeCulloch (1975b).
