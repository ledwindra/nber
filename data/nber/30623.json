    "abstract": "\n\nHow do firms set wages across space? Using job-level vacancy data and a survey of HR managers, we show that 40-50% of a job\u2019s posted wages are identical across locations within a firm. Moreover, nominal posted wages within the firm vary relatively little with local prices, a pattern we verify with other measures of job level wages. Using the co-movement of wage growth across establishments, we argue these patterns reflect national wage setting---a significant minority of firms choose to set the same nominal wage for a job across all their establishments, despite varying local labor market conditions.\n\n",
