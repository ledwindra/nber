    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the consequences of the differences in the timing of information disclosure between the U.S. and Japanese patent systems.  Under the Japanese system it is possible for a firm to apply for a patent knowing the exact specifications of a rival's patent application.  In contrast, in the U.S. the only way a firm learns about a rival's innovation is upon the actual granting of the rival's patent.  We argue that this difference enables Japanese firms to coordinate their R&D efforts better than their U.S. counterparts and that this, in turn, leads to smaller quality improvements under the Japanese system.  We show that the creation/diffusion tradeoff of patents can be influenced not only by the scope and length of patent protection but also by other features of the patenting process.\n\n",
