    "abstract": "\n\nThe\"new view\" of the property tax is reformulated within the context of a model with interjurisdictional competition, endogenous local public services, individuals who are segregated into homogeneous communities according to tastes for local public services, a simple form of land use zoning, and a political or constitutional constraint on the use of head taxes by local governments. Expressions for the \"profits tax\" and\"excise tax\" effects of the property tax are derived. The effects of a \"consumption distortion\" away from government services due to local reluctance to tax mobile capital are also examined.\n\n",
