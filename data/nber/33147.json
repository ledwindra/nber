    "abstract": "\n\nWe evaluate the impact of Step Up, a cognitive behavioral therapy program administered to inmates at the Lubbock County Detention Center in Lubbock, Texas. Step Up aims to address self-destructive thought and behavior patterns through a combination of group classes, one-on-one counseling, and a structured workbook. We compare individuals over time who enter the Step Up program to a group of eligible and interested nonparticipants in an unbalanced two-way fixed effects framework. Despite similarities in observable characteristics and initial behavior metrics, individuals who enter Step Up exhibit a 49% reduction in monthly behavioral incident rates compared to the untreated group, which is about an 8-percentage point decline. The typical participant spends about 3 months in the program, and we find evidence that the behavioral improvements persist after program completion.\n\n",
