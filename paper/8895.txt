ABSTRACT
A number of studies have identifed patterns of positive correlation of returns, or comovement,
among different traded securities. We distinguish three views of such comovement. The traditional
"fundamentals" view explains the comovement of securities through positive correlations in the rational
determinants of their values, such as cash flows or discount rates. "Category-based" comovement occurs
when investors classify different securities into the same asset class and shift resources in and out of this
class in correlated ways. A related phenomenon of "habitat-based" comovement arises when a group of
investors restricts its trading to a given set of securities, and moves in and out of that set in tandem.
We present models of each of the three types of comovement, and then assess them empirically
using data on stock inclusions into and deletions from the S&P 500 index. Index changes are noteworthy
because they change a stock's category and investor clientele (habitat), but do not change its fundamentals.
We find that when a stock is added to the index, its beta and R-squared with respect to the index increase,
while its beta with respect to stocks outside the index falls. The converse happens when a stock is deleted.
These results are broadly supportive of the category and habitat views of comovement, but not of the
fundamentals view. More generally, we argue that these non-traditional views may help explain other
instances of comovement in the data.

1 Introduction
Researchers studying the structure of asset returns have uncovered numerous patterns of
comovement. There is a strong common factor in the returns of small-cap stocks, for example,
and also in the returns of value stocks, closed-end funds, stocks in the same industry, and
bonds of the same rating and maturity. There is common movement within national markets
and across international markets.
Common factors such as these have attracted considerable attention because of the possible role assets' loadings on them play in explaining average rates of return. However, little
work has been done on understanding why the common factors arise in the rst place. Why
do certain groups of assets comove while others do not? What determines loadings, or betas,
on these common factors? In this paper, we consider three theories of comovement { one
traditional, two more novel { and present new evidence in support of the non-traditional
theories.
The traditional view, derived from economies without frictions and with rational investors, is that comovement in prices re ects comovement in fundamental values. Since, in a
frictionless economy with rational investors, prices equal fundamental value { in other words,
the sum of an asset's rationally forecasted cash ows, discounted at a rate appropriate for
their risk { any comovement in prices must be due to comovement in fundamentals.
An asset's fundamental value can change either because rational investors revise their
expectations about future cash ows or because they apply a di erent discount rate to
those cash ows. Under the traditional view, then, correlation in returns is due either to
correlated changes in rationally expected cash ows or to correlated changes in rationally
applied discount rates. Correlated discount rates can in turn arise because of news about
interest rates or risk aversion, which a ects all discount rates simultaneously, or because
of correlated changes in assets' rationally perceived risk. There is little doubt that this
\fundamentals" view of comovement explains many instances of common factors in returns:
stocks in the oil industry move together because there is a common component to news
about their future earnings, while the market factor in stock returns is at least in part due
to changes in interest rates.1
A number of recent papers, however, present evidence suggesting that the traditional
view of comovement is incomplete. Froot and Dabora (1999) study Siamese-twin stocks,
which are claims to the same cash- ow stream, but are traded in di erent locations. Royal
Dutch, traded primarily in the U.S., and Shell, traded primarily in the U.K., are perhaps

The ndings of Shiller (1989) illustrate the importance of accounting for changes in discount rates when
examining patterns of comovement. He shows that the U.S. and U.K. stock markets comove more than can
be explained by correlation in news about dividends alone; however, he also shows that allowing for plausible
changes in discount rates can potentially explain the residual comovement.

the best known example. If return comovement is purely a re ection of comovement in news
about fundamentals, these two stocks should be perfectly correlated. In fact, as Froot and
Dabora show, Royal Dutch comoves more with the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks than Shell
does, while Shell comoves more with the FTSE index of U.K. stocks.
Hardouvelis, La Porta, and Wizman (1994) and Bodurtha, Kim, and Lee (1995) uncover
related evidence in their studies of closed-end country funds, whose assets trade in a di erent
location from the funds themselves. Since funds and their underlying assets represent claims
to similar cash- ow streams, the fundamentals view of comovement predicts that fund returns
and returns on their net asset values should be highly correlated. In fact, closed-end country
funds comove much more with the national stock market in the country where they are
traded than with the national stock market in the country where their assets are traded.
For example, a closed-end fund invested in German equities but traded in the U.S. typically
comoves more with the U.S. stock market than with the German stock market.
Fama and French (1995) investigate whether the strong common factors detected in
the returns of value stocks and small stocks by Fama and French (1993) can be traced to
common factors in the earnings of these stocks. While they do uncover a common factor
in the earnings of small stocks, as well as in the earnings of value stocks, these cash- ow
factors line up poorly with the return factors. Once again, there appears to be comovement
in returns that has little to do with comovement in news about fundamentals.
Finally, Pindyck and Rotemberg (1990) nd strong comovement in the prices of seven
commodities { wheat, cotton, copper, gold, crude oil, lumber, and cocoa { that are chosen to
be as independent of one another as possible. They are neither complements nor substitutes,
are grown in di erent climates and are used for di erent purposes. Under the traditional
view of comovement, the only plausible source of price correlation is news about aggregate
demand. However, even after experimenting with a variety of forecasting models, Pindyck
and Rotemberg are unable to nd suÆcient volatility in news about aggregate demand to
fully explain the comovement.2
These examples suggest that investor trading patterns, and not just fundamentals, determine comovement. In this paper, we consider two speci c models of such trading-induced
comovement. The rst model is based on the \category" view of comovement, recently analyzed by Barberis and Shleifer (2003). They argue that when making portfolio decisions,
many investors rst group assets into categories such as small-cap stocks, oil industry stocks,
or junk bonds, and then allocate funds at the level of these various categories rather than at
Pindyck and Rotemberg (1993) uncover similar evidence in an analogous study of stock returns. They
construct groups of stocks that are in completely di erent lines of business and nd that even though
the stocks within each group are in di erent industries, their returns still comove strongly. This \excess"
comovement remains after controlling for any cash- ow or discount rate correlation induced by news about
future macroeconomic conditions.

the individual asset level. If some of the investors who use categories are noise traders with
correlated sentiment, and if their trading a ects prices, then as they move funds from one
category to another, their coordinated demand will induce common factors in the returns of
assets that happen to be classi ed into the same category, even if these assets' cash ows
are largely uncorrelated.
Our second model of trading-induced comovement, which we refer to as the \habitat" view
of comovement, starts from the observation that many investors choose to trade only a subset
of all available securities. Such preferred habitats may arise because of transaction costs,
international trading restrictions, or lack of information (Merton, 1987). As these investors'
risk aversion or sentiment changes, they alter their exposure to the securities in their habitat,
thereby inducing a common factor in the returns of these securities. For example, Lee,
Shleifer, and Thaler (1991) argue that closed-end mutual funds are a preferred habitat of
individual investors, and that therefore their market prices comove with the demand shifts
of individual investors even when their fundamentals do not. More generally, this view of
comovement predicts that there will be a common factor in the returns of securities that are
held and traded by a speci c subset of investors, such as individual investors.3
Trading-induced comovement is a simple way of understanding the empirical evidence
described above. If small-cap stocks and value stocks form natural categories in investors'
minds { and the large number of money managers and mutual funds focused on such stocks
suggests that they do { then the category view of comovement predicts that there will be
common factors in the returns of such stocks that are only weakly related to any common factors in their cash ows. Moreover, if many individual investors in the U.S. con ne themselves
to holding domestically traded securities, then the habitat view of comovement predicts that
closed-end country funds traded in the U.S. will comove substantially with U.S. stocks even
if their holdings consist of foreign equities.
The idea that trading unrelated to news about fundamental value might generate comovement builds on earlier evidence that such trading a ects prices. Some of the best-known
evidence of this type comes from stock index rede nitions. When an index is rede ned, investors who follow it must reduce their holdings of securities that have been downweighted
in the index and buy those whose weighting has increased. Under the eÆcient markets view,
these demand shifts should not a ect prices, as they carry no information about fundamental
value. However, Harris and Gurel (1986), Shleifer (1986), and Lynch and Mendenhall (1997)
nd strong price e ects for S&P 500 inclusions, while Kaul, Mehrotra, and Morck (1999) and
Greenwood (2001) nd similar e ects in the Toronto Stock Exchange TSE 300 and Nikkei

Other models which consider investor habitats are motivated by similar information and transaction
cost considerations as our own, but focus on di erent issues. Merton (1987) analyses the cross-sectional
implications when investors apply standard mean-variance analysis, but only over a subset of available
assets. Our focus is on the e ects of habitat-level demand shifts that a ect all stocks in the habitat equally.

225 indices, respectively.4
In this paper, we return to the S&P 500 inclusion and deletion data. The same data
that has proved useful in showing that uninformed demand can a ect prices may also be
helpful in showing that such demand can generate comovement. Since addition to the S&P
500 does not a ect fundamental value, a stock's inclusion should not cause a change in the
correlation of its fundamental value with the fundamental values of other stocks already in
the index. Under the fundamentals view of comovement, then, it should not cause a change
in the correlation of the stock's return with the return of the S&P. In particular, a univariate
regression of a stock's return on the S&P return both before and after the stock's inclusion
should produce similar slope coeÆcients, or S&P betas, and similar R2 s.
On the other hand, the vast popularity of S&P-linked investment products suggests that
the index is a preferred habitat for some investors, and is viewed as a natural category by
many more. Category-based investors include investors pursuing passive portfolio strategies
through index funds as well as index arbitrageurs exploiting discrepancies between cash and
futures prices. The trading-based theories therefore di er from the fundamentals view in
their predictions about patterns of comovement before and after a stock's inclusion. In
particular, simple models of the category and habitat views predict that in the univariate
regression described above, the S&P beta and R2 should increase after inclusion; that in
a bivariate regression of a stock's return on both the S&P and a non-S&P \rest of the
market" index, the S&P beta should rise after the stock's inclusion while the non-S&P beta
should fall; that these patterns should go in the opposite direction for deletions; that these
e ects should be stronger in more recent data as the S&P becomes more widely used as a
category and habitat; and that there should be a decrease in the correlation between S&P
and non-S&P returns over time, again as the S&P becomes a more important category.
Our evidence supports the trading-based theories. Over a range of data frequencies,
stocks added to the S&P increase their beta and R2 with the S&P, while in bivariate regressions that control for non-S&P returns, increases in S&P beta are even more pronounced.
Signi cant results in the opposite direction are observed when stocks are deleted from the
index, and e ects for both inclusions and deletions are stronger in more recent data. We
also con rm a signi cant decrease in the correlation of S&P and non-S&P returns over time.
While adding a stock to the S&P 500 should not cause a change in the cash- ow covariance matrix, it is possible to construct alternative explanations for our results under which a
stock's inclusion coincides with a shift in the covariance matrix. To rule these explanations
out, we also conduct a \matching" analysis: for each \event" stock included into the S&P
index, we search for a matching stock, drawn from the same industry as the event stock
Numerous other papers present evidence consistent with uninformed demand a ecting prices. These
include French and Roll (1986), Lamont and Thaler (2000), Goetzmann and Massa (2001), Gompers and
Metrick (2001), and Mitchell, Pulvino, and Sta ord (2002).

and with similar market capitalization and recent growth in capitalization, but which is not
added to the S&P. We nd that at daily and weekly frequencies, the matching stocks display
much smaller shifts in S&P and non-S&P betas than do the event stocks.
Our univariate regression results t well with the evidence of Vijh (1994), who investigates
whether the rise of S&P-linked products a ects stocks' beta with respect to the overall
market. He nds a signi cant increase in stocks' betas after inclusion, which is consistent
with the increase in S&P beta we detect, given the dominant contribution of S&P stocks to
the value-weighted market return.
In a recent paper, Greenwood and Sosner (2002) also test our model. Instead of focusing
on the S&P 500, they use data on additions to and deletions from the Nikkei index. They
nd evidence of increases in beta and R2 following a stock's addition to the index, and of
decreases following deletions. Their evidence is thus also consistent with the predictions of
our model; if anything, the results for the Japanese data are even stronger than those for
the U.S. data.
In Section 2, we present some simple models illustrating the various views of comovement,
as well as their distinct predictions. In Section 3, we test a number of these predictions using
data on S&P 500 inclusions and deletions. Section 4 concludes.
2 Three Models of Comovement
In this section, we lay out three theories of return comovement. The models we present are
simple, but they nevertheless allow us to illustrate the predictions of each theory. These
predictions motivate the empirical work in Section 3.
In all three models, the economy contains a riskless asset in perfectly elastic supply and
with a zero rate of return, and also 2n risky assets in xed supply. Risky asset i is a claim
to a single liquidating dividend D to be paid at some later time T . The eventual dividend
equals
D = D 0 +" 1 +:::+" ;

Fundamentals-based Comovement

Under the fundamentals view, comovement in returns is due to comovement in news about
fundamental value. This prediction emerges from a wide range of models. We present a
simple example below. This model provides a natural benchmark that we can compare to
our alternative models of comovement.
The economy contains a large number of identical agents known as \fundamental traders."
They have CARA utility de ned over the value of their invested wealth one period later,
and take price changes to be normally distributed.6 They therefore solve
max E ( exp[ (W + N 0(P +1 P ))]);
(3)
where
P = (P1 ; : : : ; P2 )0
N = (N1 ; : : : ; N2 )0 ;
and where N is the number of shares allocated to risky asset i, governs the degree of risk
aversion, E denotes fundamental trader expectations at time t; and W is time t wealth.

Equation (9) shows that in this economy, return comovement simply re ects comovement
in news about fundamental value. More speci cally, since discount rates are constant, it
re ects comovement in news about future cash ows.7 This model is useful for understanding
many instances of common factors in returns. The strong market and industry factors in
returns, for example, are at least in part due to market-level and industry-level factors in
cash- ow news.

Category-based Comovement

Barberis and Shleifer (2003) argue that when making their portfolio decisions, many investors
rst group assets into categories based on some characteristic, and then allocate funds at
the level of these categories rather than at the level of individual securities. Thinking about
investments in terms of categories is particularly attractive to institutional investors who,
as duciaries, must follow systematic rules in their portfolio allocation. Investing by category simpli es the investment process, and also provides a consistent way of evaluating the
performance of money managers.
To test any predictions that emerge from a category-based model, it is important to have
a concrete way of identifying categories. One place to start is to look at the labels mutual
and pension fund managers use to describe their products to clients. If money managers are
responsive to client needs, they will choose labels that correspond to the categories people
like to use when thinking about investments. For example, since many money managers o er
funds that invest in value stocks, \value stocks" may be a category in the minds of many
investors. This way of thinking suggests that Treasury bonds, junk bonds, large stocks, small
stocks, growth stocks, or stocks within a particular industry, country, or index are also all
examples of categories.

Discount rates are constant because the riskless rate is constant, as are investors' risk aversion and their
perception of risk.
7

7

The category view of comovement holds that some of the investors who use categories
are noise traders with correlated sentiment. As their sentiment changes, they channel funds
in and out of the various categories. If these fund ows a ect prices, they will generate
common factors in the returns of assets that happen to be classi ed into the same category,
even if these assets' fundamental values are uncorrelated. For example, if \value stocks" is
a popular category, then as noise traders move funds in and out of value stocks in line with
their changing sentiment about value stocks, they will create a common factor in value stock
returns even if value stock earnings are completely uncorrelated.
To see this in a formal model, suppose that there are just two such categories, X and
Y , and that risky assets 1 through n are in category X while assets n + 1 through 2n are
in Y . It may be helpful to think of X and Y as \old economy" and \new economy" stocks,
respectively. We write noise trader demand N for shares of an asset i in category X at
time t as8

The fact that the demand for all assets within a category is the same underscores the fact
that these investors allocate funds at the category level and do not distinguish among assets
in the same category.
This economy also contains fundamental traders whose objective function is the one in
(3). In this case, they double up as market makers, treating the noise trader demand as a
supply shock. Given their expectations about future prices, current prices are given by
P = E (P +1 ) V (Q N );

We simplify this further by imposing a more speci c structure on the cash- ow covariance matrix  . In particular, we suppose that the cash- ow shock to an asset has
three components: a market-wide cash- ow factor which a ects assets in both categories, a
category-speci c cash- ow factor which a ects assets in one category but not the other, and
a completely idiosyncratic cash- ow shock speci c to a single asset. Formally, for iX ,

f and f are idiosyncratic factors;
and are constants which control the relative
importance of the three components. Each factor has unit variance and is orthogonal to the
other factors. This implies

correlation between any two assets in di erent categories is also the same.

con rming fundamental traders' conjecture about the structure of the conditional covariance
matrix of returns: cov(P +1 ; P +1) is constant for all distinct assets i and j in the same
category, and it is also constant for all assets i and j in di erent categories. We study
equilibria in which the speci c values of 2 , 1 , and 2 conjectured by fundamental traders
are also con rmed by (20).9
Equation (20) shows that in this economy, there can be a common factor in the returns
of a group of stocks simply because those stocks happen to belong to the same category.
When noise traders experience a positive sentiment shock u +1 about category X , they
invest more in all securities in X , pushing the prices of these assets up together.
The intuition for why u +1 a ects the return on stock 1 is clear enough: when noise
traders become bullish about old economy stocks, they channel funds into X , pushing the
prices of all securities in that category up. Why u +1 also a ects the return on stock 1 is
less obvious. Suppose that noise traders become bullish about new economy stocks, pushing
up the prices of securities in Y . Fundamental traders, seeing an overvaluation, will short
stocks in Y , and hedge themselves as much as possible against adverse fundamental news
by buying stocks in X . In this way, the sentiment shock about category Y , u +1; is also
transmitted to stocks in X .
The fact that in our model, noise traders a ect prices { and hence also, patterns of
comovement { relies on the assumption that fundamental traders have horizons which end
before cash- ow uncertainty is resolved at time T . If fundamental traders only cared about
wealth at time T , they would be more aggressive in countering the e ect of noise traders.
However, since they have a one-period horizon, they are forced to worry about future noise
trader demand, which makes them invest less aggressively. Equations (20) and (21) show
that a high risk aversion or perceived stock volatility 2 make them particularly reluctant
to bet against the noise traders, increasing the impact of the sentiment shocks on returns.

It is straightforward to show that such equilibria exist for a wide range of values of the exogeneous

The idea that fundamental traders may have short horizons has been emphasized by
earlier work on limits to arbitrage (De Long, Shleifer, Summers, Waldmann 1990, Shleifer
and Vishny 1997). That such constraints might limit arbitrage capacity is supported by the
considerable empirical evidence, cited in the introduction, suggesting that demand unrelated
to news about fundamental value a ects security prices. Moreover, Wurgler and Zhuravskaya
(2001) con rm that arbitrageurs are particularly wary of countering noise traders when the
risk of doing so is greater. They show that the price jump on inclusion into an index is much
larger for stocks with poor substitutes, in other words, for those cases where arbitrageurs
face higher risk.
To uncover evidence of category-induced comovement, we look for testable predictions
that are unique to this economy. One set of predictions describes what happens when a
stock enters a new category. Such reclassi cation can occur in many ways. For example, if
the market capitalization of a large-cap stock declines suÆciently, it will enter the small-cap
stock category. More simply, stocks are regularly added to indices like the S&P 500 and
Russell 2000 to replace stocks that have been removed due to bankruptcy or merger.
Our rst prediction is:
Proposition 1: Suppose that risky asset j , previously a member of Y; is reclassi ed into X .
Then, assuming a xed cash- ow covariance matrix D , and as the number of risky assets
n ! 1, the OLS esimate of j in the univariate regression

as well as the R2 of this regression, increase after reclassi cation.10

The intuition is straightforward: when asset j enters category X , it is bu eted by noise
traders' ows of funds in and out of that category. This increases its covariance with the
return on category X , P , and hence also its beta loading on that return. For simplicity,
we assume that the cash- ow covariance matrix remains xed. A more general version of the
proposition would predict that beta increases more than can be explained by any increase
in cash- ow correlation.
A similar intuition lies behind the following prediction:

Proposition 2 identi es a test that is potentially more powerful than the test in Proposition 1. The essential prediction of the category view of comovement is that when a stock
enters category X , it becomes more sensitive to the category X sentiment shock u . Of
course, P is not a clean measure of this sentiment shock; a substantial part of its variation comes from news about market-level cash ows, f . In regression (24), P can be
thought of as a control for such news, making the coeÆcient on P a cleaner measure of
sensitivity to u .
Note that Propositions 1 and 2 will not hold if, as in Section 2.1., there are no noise traders
with demand function (10) in the economy, or if fundamental traders are able to counteract
their e ect. In these cases, return correlation is completely determined by correlation in
news about fundamental value. Therefore if, as assumed in the propositions, the cash- ow
covariance matrix  remains constant, the correlation structure of returns will also remain
constant. In other words, and R2 in Proposition 1 and and in Proposition 2 will
remain unchanged after reclassi cation.

is lower than it would be in an economy that contains only fundamental traders.

When the economy contains only fundamental traders, the correlation of the returns of
categories X and Y is completely determined by the correlation of the fundamentals of those
two categories. Introducing noise traders adds less than perfectly correlated shocks to the
returns of categories X and Y; lowering the correlation between them.
Proposition 3 becomes testable in the time series if the fraction of investors with demand
functions in (10) grows over time; in that case, assuming a xed cash- ow covariance matrix,
the correlation of the two categories' returns should fall over time.

2.3

Habitat-based Comovement

The habitat view of comovement starts from the observation that many investors trade only
a subset of all available securities. Such preferred habitats may arise because of transaction
costs, international trading restrictions, or lack of information (Merton, 1987). For example,
suppose that one group of investors { \habitat X " investors { trades only securities 1 through
n, a set we again refer to as X , while another group { habitat Y investors { trades only
n + 1 through 2n, set Y . We can think of assets 1 through n as U.S. stocks, and assets
n + 1 through 2n as U.K. stocks; there are many investors in both countries who restrict
themselves to trading only domestic securities. We emphasize that X and Y play di erent
roles here than in Section 2.2. There, they represent groups of assets that some investors
do not distinguish between when allocating their demand. Here, they represent groups of
assets that are the sole holdings of some investors.
Now suppose that habitat X investors experience an increase in risk aversion. They will
then reduce their positions in all the risky assets they hold, generating a common factor in
the returns of securities in X , even if those risky assets' fundamental values are uncorrelated.
More generally, the habitat view of comovement predicts a common factor in the returns
of any group of stocks that happens to be the primary holdings of a particular subset of
investors.
To compare this view to the category-based view, suppose that habitat X investors'
demand for risky assets is given by
(25)

We think of u as tracking their level of risk aversion, changes in which lead them to alter
their exposure to all assets in X . Of course, u can also be interpreted as an indicator of
sentiment about the future returns of assets in X , although the model does not require such
an interpretation. By de nition, habitat X investors' demand for assets in Y is zero.
Similarly, habitat Y investors' demand is

As before, we close the economy with fundamental traders who behave as in (3). Given
13

their expectations about future prices, current prices are given by
P = E (P +1 ) V (Q (N 1 + N 2 ))
(27)
= E (P +1 ) V (Q N );
exactly as in (12). In other words, even though investors' demand functions are motivated
di erently here than in the case of category-based comovement, prices are the same. Once
again, there will be a common factor in the returns of assets in X even if there is no common
factor in their fundamentals.
The equivalence in equation (27) means that Propositions 1 through 3 also hold in this
economy, with X and Y signifying investor habitats, not categories. For example, Proposition
1 should now be interpreted as predicting that if a stock becomes part of the habitat of a
speci c group of investors, it will comove more with the other assets in that habitat than it
did before.
It is important to note that the habitat-based view of comovement depends on limits
to arbitrage, just as the category-based view does. The fact that some investors trade only
certain securities means that habitats X and Y can trade at di erent prices, even if their nal
cash ows are similar, thus opening up potentially attractive opportunities for unconstrained
arbitrageurs. Since fundamental traders have short horizons in our model, they are unable
to exploit these opportunities very aggressively.

3 Empirical Tests
Propositions 1 through 3 lay out predictions that hold in an economy where return comovement is in part due to category-based or habitat-based trading ows, but which do not
hold in an economy where return comovement is entirely a function of comovement in news
about fundamentals. We now test these predictions to see if we can uncover any evidence of
trading-induced comovement.
To test the propositions, we need to identify a group of securities with three characteristics. First, the group must be viewed as a natural category, or must be a preferred habitat
for many investors, or both. Second, since our rst two propositions concern reclassi cation,
there must be clear and identi able changes in group membership over time. Finally, in
order to control for fundamentals-based comovement, a security's inclusion or removal from
the group should not cause a change in the correlation of the security's fundamental value
with the fundamental values of other securities in the group.
One set of securities that satis es these requirements is the S&P 500 index. Earlier
we suggested identifying categories by looking at the products money managers o er their
14

clients. The immense popularity of S&P-linked products suggests that this index may be
a natural category in many investors' minds: S&P index funds and depositary receipts are
important investment vehicles for both institutions and individuals, while S&P 500 futures
are heavily traded by index arbitrageurs. The S&P 500 may also be a preferred habitat for
U.S. investors who are reluctant to invest in foreign stocks and who doubt that active fund
managers can outperform passive indices.
The S&P also has the second characteristic we require: there is clear and identi able
turnover in its membership. In a typical year there are about 30 changes; our full sample,
which we describe in Section 3.1, includes 455 additions and 76 deletions.
Finally, the act of adding a stock to the S&P 500 should not cause a change in the
covariance of the stock's cash ows with other stocks' cash ows. The stated goal of Standard
and Poor's is to make the index representative of the U.S. economy, not to provide signals
about future cash ows. Deletions from the index, however, are another matter. Stocks
are usually removed from the index because a rm is merging, being taken over, or nearing
bankruptcy. In these situations cash- ow characteristics may well be changing, so we exclude
these cases from our deletion sample.
We therefore test Propositions 1 through 3 for the case where X is the S&P 500, and Y
is stocks outside that index. In Section 3.2., in line with Proposition 1, we test whether a
stock's beta with the S&P and the fraction of its variance explained by the index increase
(decrease) after the stock's inclusion in (removal from) the index. In Section 3.3., in line
with Proposition 2, we test whether a stock's beta with the S&P, controlling for the return of
non -S&P stocks, goes up (falls) after inclusion (deletion). Finally, in Section 3.6., motivated
by Proposition 3, we test whether the correlation of S&P and non-S&P stocks has fallen in
line with the growing importance of the S&P as a category.
Our null hypothesis, laid out in Section 2.1., is that return comovement is primarily a
function of comovement in news about fundamentals, so that the betas and R2 just described,
as well as the correlation of S&P and non-S&P stocks, do not change. The alternative
hypothesis is that trading ows do induce comovement, and that the betas, R2, and crosscategory correlation change as predicted in the propositions.
While adding a stock to the S&P 500 should not cause a change in the cash- ow covariance matrix, it is possible that a stock's inclusion may coincide with a shift in the covariance
matrix, and that this may drive some of our results. We address this possibility in Section
3.4.

15

3.1

Data

We consider S&P 500 index inclusions between September 22, 1976 and December 31, 2000
and deletions between January 1, 1979 and December 31, 2000. Standard & Poor's did not
record announcement dates of index changes before September 1976 and we were unable to
obtain data on deletions before 1979.
There are 590 inclusion events in the inclusion sample period and 565 deletions in the
deletion sample period. Inclusion events are excluded if the new rm is a spin-o or a
restructured version of a rm already in the index, if the rm is engaged in a merger or
takeover around the inclusion event, or if required return data is not available. Deletion
events are excluded if the rm is involved in a merger, takeover, or bankruptcy proceeding,
or if required return data is not available.11 These circumstances, determined by searching
the NEXIS database, exclude the vast majority of deletions. The nal sample includes 455
inclusions and 76 deletions.12
3.2

Univariate Regressions

If category-induced or habitat-induced trading ows cause return comovement, Proposition
1 predicts that stocks which are added to (deleted from) the S&P 500 will comove more
(less) with the other members of the index after the addition or deletion event.
For each inclusion and deletion event, we run the univariate regression
R = + R 500 + v
(28)
separately for the period before the event and for the period after the event, and record
the change in slope coeÆcient,  , and the change in R2 , R2. R is the return of the
stock involved in the change between time t 1 and t, while R 500 is the contemporaneous
return on the S&P 500 index, obtained from the CRSP Index on the S&P Universe le.13
We run these regressions for three data frequencies: daily, weekly, and monthly. With
daily and weekly data, the pre-event regression is run over the 12-month period ending the
month before the month of the inclusion announcement, while the post-event regression is
run over a 12-month period starting the month after the month of the inclusion implementation. In the case of monthly data, we use a 36-month period ending a month before the

This last possibility may arise if the event occurs so close to the end of the sample that it prevents us
from estimating post-event betas.
12 The S&P 500 inclusion and deletion data are available upon request.
13 In order to avoid spurious e ects, we remove the contribution of the stock in question from the righthand side variable. For addition events, this means that there are 500 stocks in the right-hand side variable
before the addition, and 499 afterward. The reverse applies for deletion events.
11

16

announcement month and a 36-month period starting a month after the implementation
month for the pre-event and post-event regressions, respectively.14
Table 1 reports the change in slope coeÆcient, averaged across all events in the sample,
 , as well as the average change in R2, R2 . It con rms that stocks added to the S&P
500 experience a strongly signi cant increase in daily and weekly betas and R2: In the full
sample of additions, the mean increase in daily beta is 0.151 and in weekly data, 0.11. At
the monthly frequency, though, we are unable to detect a signi cant increase in either beta
or R2: Other than a weakly signi cant change in daily beta, we do not detect signi cant
drops in beta or R2 around deletion events.
Another prediction of trading-based comovement is that since the importance of the S&P
as a category has grown over the course of our sample, the e ects predicted by Proposition
1 should be stronger in the second half of our sample. Table 1 con rms that at daily and
weekly frequencies, the increases in beta and R2 across inclusion events are statistically
stronger over the second subsample.
The standard errors in the table deserve comment. If two events are close together in
calendar time, there may be substantial overlap in the time periods covered by the regressions
associated with each event. This means that the disturbances v may be correlated across
events, which in turn implies that the  may not be independent but rather autocorrelated
at several lags.
We use simulation methods to compute standard errors that account for this dependence.
We generate a simulated data set, consisting of an S&P return and returns on included stocks,
and set the cross-sectional correlation of the disturbance terms to whatever value generates
a rst-order autocorrelation in the  's equal to that observed in our results. We then
compute  in this sample, under the null that betas do not change after inclusion. By
generating many such data sets, we obtain the distribution of  under the null, and hence
also, appropriate standard errors.15

Up until October 1989, inclusions and deletions were made e ective on the day of their announcement.
Since then, the changes have been announced a few weeks in advance of their actual implementation. It is
not clear whether to view the to-be-added stock as being in the index, or not in the index during the time
between announcement and implementation; signi cant price e ects have been documented on both days
(Lynch and Mendenhall, 1997). To avoid these issues entirely, we do not use data from the month of the
announcement or of the implementation; these are almost always the same month.
15 It turns out that at least for daily and weekly frequencies, cross-correlation of disturbances does not a ect
the standard errors by very much. The reason is that such cross-correlation produces positive autocorrelation
in the  j at the rst few lags but negative autocorrelation at higher lags. As a result, the variance of 
is only slightly higher than if the disturbances were uncorrelated.
14

17

3.3

Bivariate Regressions

The univariate regressions provide evidence of trading-based comovement at higher frequencies. Stronger evidence comes from tests of Proposition 2, which predicts that controlling
for the return of non -S&P stocks, a stock that is added to or removed from the S&P will
experience a large change in its loading on the S&P return. To test this, for each inclusion
and deletion, we run the bivariate regression
R = +
(29)
500 R 500 + non 500 Rnon 500 + v
for the period before the event and the period after the event, and record the changes in
S&P and non-S&P betas,  500 and  non 500. Rnon 500 is the return on non-S&P
stocks in the NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq universe between time t 1 and time t. This is
inferred from index return and capitalization data using the identity that the capitalizationweighted average return of S&P stocks and of non-S&P stocks equals the overall CRSP
value-weighted return on NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq stocks.
As before, we run the regressions at daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies. Daily and
weekly regressions are run over a 12-month period ending the month before the announcement month and over a 12-month period starting the month after the implementation month.
The monthly regressions use 36-month periods before announcement and after implementation.
Table 1 reports the change in S&P beta, averaged across all events in the sample,  500,
as well as the average change in non-S&P beta,  non 500. The results are stronger than
the univariate results. At all three data frequencies, S&P 500 inclusion is associated with a
substantial and signi cant increase in beta with the S&P and a substantial and signi cant
decrease in beta with the rest of the market. For example, daily beta with the S&P 500
goes up by an average of 0.357 and daily beta with other stocks drops by -0.373. Large
and signi cant results also obtain for deletion events at the daily and weekly frequencies.
Moreover, the table con rms that at all three data frequencies, the changes in S&P and
non-S&P betas are statistically stronger in the second subsample.
Figure I uses rolling regressions to show the dynamics of these changes. Panel A shows
how the daily betas change over event time. The solid line shows the mean daily S&P beta
and the dashed line shows the mean daily non-S&P beta. These coeÆcients are re-estimated
each month using the prior 12 months of daily data. Therefore coeÆcients plotted to the left
of the left vertical line use only pre-event returns. CoeÆcients plotted to the right of the right
vertical line use only post-event returns. CoeÆcients in between use both pre- and post-event
data. In terms of these gures, the beta changes reported in Table 1 are the average beta
as of event month +12, which uses data from months [+1, +12] minus the average beta as
of event month -1, which uses data from months [-12, -1]. There are fewer data points in

the gures than in the table, however, because the gures include only rms with available
return data for a full 24 months after inclusion. To be clear, the steady change in estimated
betas between the two vertical lines should not be interpreted as a steady change in true
betas. Rather, it arises from mixing data from the pre- and post-event regimes.
Our results on changes in S&P and non-S&P betas are consistent with the ndings of
Vijh (1994), who studies whether the rise of S&P-linked products has a ected the standard
measure of stock risk, namely beta with respect to the overall market return. He nds that
over the 1975-1989 period, a stock's daily beta with the market goes up by a statistically
signi cant 0.08, on average, after inclusion. Since a large fraction of overall market value
comes from S&P stocks, this ts with the increase in S&P beta we detect over a similar time
period. Given our result that non-S&P beta falls signi cantly, it also makes sense that the
rise in overall market beta should be considerably smaller than the rise in S&P beta.16
3.4

Evaluating Alternative Explanations

We now consider two alternative explanations for the results in Table 1 and Figure I. One
possibility is that stocks in the S&P 500 index di er from other stocks in terms of some
characteristic, and that the stocks Standard and Poor's chooses to include are stocks that
are increasingly demonstrating that characteristic. If the characteristic is also associated
with a cash- ow factor, this may explain our results.
The most obvious such characteristic is size. Stocks in the S&P have considerably higher
market capitalizations than stocks outside the index, and the stocks Standard and Poor's
includes into the index have often been growing in size prior to inclusion. Moreover, size
is associated with a cash- ow factor: there is a common component to news about the
earnings of large-cap stocks. Our nding that S&P betas increase around inclusion may
simply re ect the fact that included stocks are growing in size around inclusion and are
therefore increasingly loading on the large stock cash- ow factor. More generally, this is a
story in which inclusion into the S&P coincides with a change in the cash- ow covariance
matrix, even if it does not cause it.
Another potential explanation is based on industry e ects. Suppose that some industry
becomes increasingly dominant in the economy. This increases the fraction of the value of
the S&P made up by stocks in this industry. Moreover, in an e ort to keep their index
representative, Standard and Poor's may start drawing an increasing number of new inclusions from this industry. Since S&P beta is computed using the value -weighted S&P return,

Under the CAPM, an increase in overall market beta after inclusion predicts that stocks should drop
in price when they are added to the index. The fact that such stocks actually display large price increases
upon inclusion clearly rejects this prediction.
16

19

this simultaneity can in principle explain our results: if Yahoo! is included into the S&P
at precisely the time that other technology stocks in the index are growing in value { as
indeed it was, having been added in December 1999 { it may covary more with the S&P
after inclusion than before.
To address both these competing explanations, we perform a matching exercise. For each
event stock included into the S&P during our sample period, we search for a \matching"
stock, drawn from the same industry as the event stock and in the same size decile as the
event stock, both at the time of inclusion and 12 months before inclusion, but which is not
included into the index. In other words, since the matching stock matches the event stock on
industry and on recent growth in market capitalization, it is as good a candidate for inclusion
as the event stock itself, but simply happens not to be included. If the matching stocks do
not demonstrate the same increase (decrease) in S&P (non-S&P) betas as the event stocks,
it strengthens the case that the results in Table 1 and Figure I are due to trading-based
comovement, rather than to the alternative explanations.17 In the case of deleted stocks,
the matching stock is a stock in the S&P which matches the deleted stock on industry, and
recent change in market capitalization, but which is not removed from the index.
Table 2 and Figure II contain the results of the matching exercise. Figure II, constructed
in a parallel fashion to Figure I, presents the evolution of S&P and non-S&P betas in event
time for matching stocks. Table 2 reports the change in betas and R2 in univariate and
bivariate regressions for event stocks relative to the analogous changes for matching stocks.
Figure II suggests that at daily and weekly frequencies, the alternative stories can explain
only a small fraction of our results: the matching stocks exhibit much smaller shifts in betas
than do the event stocks. However, it also suggests that at the monthly frequency, the
characteristic- and industry-based explanations do have some bite: even for matching stocks,
S&P betas increase around inclusion and non-S&P betas decrease.
Table 2 con rms these impressions. At the daily and weekly frequency, the changes in
beta and R2 in univariate regressions and in S&P and non-S&P betas in bivariate regressions,
remain strongly signi cant across inclusion events, even after subtracting o the corresponding changes for matching stocks. At the monthly level, however, a substantial part of the
strong bivariate regression results in Table 1 are explained by the matching stocks. Nonetheless, in the second subsample, the increase in S&P beta for event stocks is still signi cantly
At the monthly frequency, in order to match the window betas are computed over, we look for matching
stocks that match the event stock on size both at inclusion and 36 months before inclusion. At all frequencies,
we initially try to match by SIC4 industry code. If no match can be found, we allow the matching stock
to be in the same SIC3 industry class, then to be within one size decile at inclusion, then to be within one
size decile 12 months before inclusion, then to be in the same SIC2 industry class, then to be within two
size deciles at inclusion, then to be within two size deciles 12 months before inclusion, and nally to be
within three size deciles 12 months before inclusion. Events for which no such matches can be found are not
included in the matching exercise samples.
17

20

greater than that for matching stocks.18
Overall, it appears that trading-based comovement operates strongly at daily and weekly
frequencies; at the monthly frequency, its e ects are still present, but are less pronounced.
3.5

Calendar Time Tests

The methodology we use to test Propositions 1 and 2 in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 is often called
an \event time" approach. An alternative methodology is a \calendar time" approach. This
technique is often used to address a common statistical problem in event studies, namely
correlation of returns across events. As described in Section 3.2., we use simulations to deal
with this issue. Performing calendar time tests o ers a second way of checking that our
results are robust to these statistical considerations.
The calendar time approach requires the construction of two portfolios: a \pre-event"
portfolio whose return at time t, R , is the equal-weighted average return at time t of all
stocks that will be added to the index within some window after time t; and a \post-event"
portfolio whose return at time t, R , is the equal-weighted average return at time t of
all stocks that have been added to the index within some window preceding time t. In our
analyses of daily and weekly data, we take the window to be a year, and extend it to three
years for monthly data.
The calendar time test of Proposition 1 then calls for running two regressions:
R =
+ R 500 + v
(30)
and
R
= + R 500 + v
(31)
and checking whether
>
and whether the R2 in the second regression is greater
than in the rst.
Similarly, the calendar time test of Proposition 2 calls for running the following two
regressions,

non 500Rnon 500 + v
and

In Table 1, we conducted simulations to correct the standard errors for possible correlation in disturbance
terms across regressions. This problem a ects matching stock regressions just as much as it does event stock
regressions, but it does not a ect di erences in slopes across the two sets of regressions. The Table 2 standard
errors are therefore the usual ones { no simulation-based correction is required.

Table 3 reports the changes in slope coeÆcients and R2s. In general, the results are as
supportive of trading-based comovement as the event time tests. In the univariate regressions, signi cant increases in beta and R2 occur at the daily and weekly frequencies, and
for R2 ; even at the monthly frequency. In the bivariate regressions, the results for inclusion
events are strongly signi cant at all three data frequencies, although the results for deletion
events are weaker than before: there is no statistically signi cant e ect at any frequency.

Comovement Across Categories

Proposition 3 predicts that the correlation of the returns of two groups of securities will be
lower than the correlation of their fundamentals if these groups form natural categories or
habitats. This proposition is testable in the time series under the condition that the groups'
importance as categories or habitats has grown over time.
The S&P 500 satis es this last condition: its use in various investment styles has grown
dramatically in the last few decades. Consistent with this trend, Wurgler and Zhuravskaya
(2001) nd that the size of the inclusion price jump has grown with the volume of funds
devoted to S&P indexing, and our earlier results show increasing comovement e ects in more
recent years.
Table 4 reports the trends in comovement between the S&P and other stocks over the
past thirty years. The left column shows that the relative size of the S&P and whole market
has remained constant. The declining correlations in the right columns show that at all
three data frequencies, the returns on the S&P 500 have grown increasingly divorced from
the returns on the rest of the market. The correlation in returns remains high today, but it
is not as high as it was prior to the advent of the S&P 500 as a category. Another interesting
pattern is that the decline in the daily correlation seems to have halted in recent years, while
the weekly and monthly correlations continue to decline.
In Table 5 we determine whether the decreasing correlation between S&P and non-S&P
stocks is statistically signi cant, or whether the correlation between two random groups
would on average display a similar decline. We construct value-weighted returns on a random
group of 500 stocks and compute their correlation with the value-weighted returns on the
rest of the market over consecutive ve year periods. By repeating this procedure for many
random groups of 500 stocks, we can construct sampling distributions for the change in
correlation over various intervals. We can then determine whether the decline in the S&P
correlation is unusually large.
The left columns of Table 5 report the sampling distribution of the changes in correlation
22

between the random 500 and the rest of the market. The correlations between random
groups of stocks have declined. Panel A shows that, from the early 1970s to the late 1990s,
the daily return correlation between random groups has fallen by a median of -0.043. For
comparison, the second column from the right reports the experience of the S&P 500. Over
this same period, Table 4 indicates that the daily return correlation between the S&P and
the rest of the market has fallen by -0.118. The last column indicates that this is a much
greater decline than expected by chance. A similar conclusion emerges for weekly data. At
the monthly level, the decline in correlation between S&P and non-S&P stocks is below the
average decline for randomly-chosen stocks, but is not statistically unusual.
Our simulation controls for the possibility that the decline in the S&P and non-S&P
return correlation is due to a general decline in the correlation of stock fundamentals. Indeed,
the results of Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001) suggest that such a decline in
fundamental correlation has occured, making it important to control for. Our simulation does
not, however, rule out the possibility that our results are due to an especially large decline
in the correlation of S&P 500 stocks' fundamentals with remaining stocks' fundamentals,
as compared to the decline in the correlation of a random 500 stocks' fundamentals with
remaining stocks' fundamentals. However, we see no obvious reason why this would be the
case, since the S&P 500 index has always been constructed to be representative of the overall
economy.19
4 Conclusion
In this paper, we present and examine empirically three models of comovement. The traditional model attributes comovement to correlation in news about fundamental value. The
two alternative models we consider explain comovement by correlated investor demand shifts
for securities in a given category, or by demand shifts by speci c investor clienteles.
To assess these theories, we consider the well-studied phenomenon of stock inclusions
into, and deletions from, the S&P 500 index. While previous studies have noted signi cant
immediate price e ects associated with inclusions and deletions, we focus on changes in the
patterns of comovement of newly included (or deleted) stocks with stocks already in the
index. We nd that stocks included into the index begin to comove more with other stocks
in the index, and less with stocks out of the index. The converse holds for deletions. Because
inclusion into the S&P 500 index conveys no news about fundamentals, this evidence is hard

Panel A of Table 4 also shows that the abrupt halt in the decline of the daily S&P correlation after 1990
is not mirrored by the random-500 correlation, while the weekly and monthly S&P correlations continue to
decline relative to the typical random-500 group. One explanation is that arbitrage has checked the decline
in the daily correlation, but has yet to stop the decline in the weekly and monthly correlations. De Long et
al. (1990) point out that long-horizon arbitrage is likely to be weaker than short-horizon arbitrage.

to reconcile with the fundamentals view of comovement, but supports the theories based on
shifts in demand.
This evidence adds to the growing range of phenomena identi ed by nancial economists
that reveal the importance of asset classi cation, and of demand shifts among asset classes,
for valuation. From this perspective, a security's price may depend not only on its fundamentals, but also on which asset categories it belongs to, and on which investors trade
it.

Before reclassi cation, C +1 = C and C +1 = V , while after reclassi cation,

C +1 = V
does indeed increase after reclassi cation, while +1 falls. This proves Proposition 2.
Finally, given the expressions for var(P +1 ), var(P +1 ), and cov(P +1 ; P +1)
in equation (35), it is immediate that
corr(P +1 ; P +1) < corr(D +1 ; D +1):

Table 3. Changes in comovement of stocks added to and deleted from the S&P 500 Index: Calendar time.
Differences between the comovement characteristics of two portfolios of stocks: those about to be added to the S&P
500 and those just recently added. The sample includes stocks added to and deleted from the S&P 500 between 1976
and 2000 which were not involved in mergers or related events, and which have sufficient return data on CRSP. A
capitalization-weighted return index of non-S&P 500 stocks (RnonSP500 ) in the NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq is inferred
from the identity described in Table 1. Returns from October 1987 are excluded. In daily data, for example, each day
we form an equal-weighted portfolio of stocks that will be added to the S&P 500 within the next year and a portfolio
of stocks that were added within in the past year. We then run separate univariate regressions for each portfolio on
the S&P 500 index,

R pre, t = α pre + β pre R SP500, t + υ pre, t and
R post,t = α post + β post RSP500, t + υ post,t ,
denoting the difference in slope and fit between the “post” and “pre” regressions as

∆β and ∆R 2 , respectively.

We also run separate bivariate regressions for each portfolio,

R pre, t = α pre + β pre, SP500 RSP500, t + β pre,nonSP500 RnonSP500,t + υ pre, t and
R post,t = α post + β post, SP500 RSP500,t + β post, nonSP500 RnonSP500,t + υ post, t ,
denoting the difference in the slopes as

∆β SP500 and ∆β nonSP500 , respectively. The mechanical influence of the pre

and post portfolio stocks is removed, as appropriate, from the independent variables. In daily and weekly data, the
pre portfolio includes stocks that will be added within one year and the post portfolio includes stocks that were
added in the past year. In monthly data, these windows are extended to three years. We require at least 10 stocks in
each portfolio in order for that observation (day, month, or year) to be included in the regressions. Standard errors
are reported in parentheses.

Table 5. Trends in the correlation between returns on the S&P 500 and the rest of the market: Relative to random 500 stocks. The decline in correlation
between returns on the S&P 500 and the rest of the market is evaluated relative to the null hypothesis that a similar decline applies to random categories of
stocks. The distribution of changes in the correlation between the return on 500 random stocks from NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq and the value-weighted return
on the rest of the market is determined by simulation. The following procedure is repeated 500 times: (i) A sample of 500 random stocks from the NYSE,
AMEX, and Nasdaq is identified from all stocks that CRSP lists for 1970. The complementary set of stocks, i.e. the rest of the market, is also identified as of
1970. (ii) The daily, weekly, and monthly correlation between these two portfolios is computed and recorded each year from 1970 through 1999. If a stock drops
out of the random 500 sample, it is replaced with a stock randomly taken from the rest of the market sample. Returns from October 1987 are excluded. (iii) These
two return series represent one sample path, over which correlations and changes in correlations can be estimated. Panels A, B, and C show results for daily,
weekly, and monthly returns, respectively.

bivariate regressions of returns of stocks added to the S&P 500 on returns of the S&P 500 Index and the non-S&P
500 rest of the market. The sample includes stocks added to the S&P 500 which were not involved in mergers or
related events (described in the text), which have complete returns data over the entire event horizon examined in
each figure (-12 to +24 months in daily and weekly returns data and –36 to +72 months in monthly returns data), and
which remain in the Index for the full post-event horizon. For each added stock j, the bivariate model

R j,t = α j + β j, SP500 RSP500,t + β j ,nonSP500 RnonSP500,t + υ j ,t
is estimated in rolling regressions where the sample intervals are [-12,-1] months for daily and weekly returns and [36,-1] months for monthly returns. Returns on the S&P 500 (RSP500 ) are from the CRSP Index on the S&P 500
Universe file. Returns on a capitalization-weighted index of the non-S&P 500 stocks (RnonSP500 ) in the NYSE,
AMEX, and Nasdaq are inferred from the identity described in Table 1. Returns from October 1987 are excluded.
The mechanical influence of the added stock is removed, as appropriate, from both independent variables. The mean
of each coefficient is plotted in event time. The left vertical line indicates the addition date; coefficients to the left of
this line are estimated using only pre-event data. Coefficients to the right of the right vertical line are estimated
using only post-event data. In between, coefficients are estimated using both pre- and post-event data. Panels A, B,

Figure II. Changes in comovement of stocks with matching characteristics to those added to the S&P 500
Index.

Each stock in the event sample is paired with another stock which matches it on industry, market

capitalization and growth in market capitalization over the pre-change estimation period (described in the text). The
event sample includes stocks added to the S&P 500 which were not involved in mergers or related events, which
have complete returns data over the entire event horizon examined in each figure (-12 to +24 months in daily and
weekly returns data and –36 to +72 months in monthly returns data), which remain in the Index for the full postevent horizon, and for which a matching stock with complete data could be found. For each corresponding matching
stock j, the bivariate model

R j,t = α j + β j, SP500 RSP500,t + β j ,nonSP500 RnonSP500,t + υ j ,t
is estimated in rolling regressions where the sample intervals are [-12,-1] months for daily and weekly returns and [36,-1] months for monthly returns. Returns on the S&P 500 (RSP500 ) are from the CRSP Index on the S&P 500
Universe file. Returns on a capitalization-weighted index of the non-S&P 500 stocks (RnonSP500 ) in the NYSE,
AMEX, and Nasdaq are inferred from the identity described in Table 1. Returns from October 1987 are excluded.
The mean matching stock coefficient is plotted in event time. The left vertical line indicates the addition date for the
corresponding event stock; coefficients to the left of this line are estimated using only pre-event data. Coefficients to
the right of the right vertical line are estimated using only post-event data. In between, coefficients are estimated
using both pre- and post-event data. Panels A, B, and C show results for daily, weekly, and monthly returns,
