    "abstract": "\n\nLarge current account deficits, and the corresponding reliance on capital flows from abroad, can increase a country\u2019s vulnerability to periods of heightened risk and uncertainty. This paper develops a framework to evaluate such vulnerabilities. It highlights the central importance of two financial factors:  income on international investments and changes in the valuations of those investments. We show how the characteristics of a country\u2019s international investment portfolio \u2013 the size of its international asset and liability holdings, their currency denominations, their split between equity and debt, and their return characteristics \u2013 affect the dynamics of these financial factors. Then we decompose those dynamics into their drivers, explore how they are affected by domestic and global risk shocks, and apply this framework to 10 OECD economies. These examples, including a more detailed assessment for the UK, show that a substantial degree of international risk sharing can occur through current accounts and international portfolios. Our flexible framework clarifies which characteristics of a country\u2019s international portfolio determine whether a current account deficit is \u201cmenacing\u201d or \u201cmitigating\u201d.\n\n",
