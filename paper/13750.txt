Planning and Financial Literacy: How Do Women Fare?

NBER Working Paper No. 13750
January 2008
JEL No. D91
ABSTRACT
Many older US households have done little or no planning for retirement, and there is a substantial
population that seems to undersave for retirement. Of particular concern is the relative position of
older women, who are more vulnerable to old-age poverty due to their longer longevity. This paper
uses data from a special module we devised on planning and financial literacy in the 2004 Health and
Retirement Study. It shows that women display much lower levels of financial literacy than the older
population as a whole. In addition, women who are less financially literate are also less likely to plan
for retirement and be successful planners. These findings have important implications for policy and
for programs aimed at fostering financial security at older ages.

Planning and Financial Literacy: How Do Women Fare?
Annamaria Lusardi and Olivia S. Mitchell∗
Many Baby Boomers are approaching retirement with perilously low levels of financial
wealth and virtually no assets other than their homes (Annamaria Lusardi and Olivia S. Mitchell
2007a). This is a particular concern for female-headed households who face many lean years
ahead (David R. Weir and Robert J. Willis 2000). Yet little is known about why people fail to
plan for retirement and how planning as well as information costs shape retirement saving
decisions. Lack of planning has important consequences for saving and portfolio choice: those
who do not plan tend to accumulate far less wealth than those who plan, and nonplanners are also
less likely to invest in stocks and tax-favored assets (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007b).
This paper examines the factors central to women’s retirement planning, relying on a
purpose-designed module we have developed for the 2004 Health and Retirement study (HRS)
on planning and financial literacy. In this module, we have inserted several questions that
measure basic levels of financial literacy, as well as questions to assess how respondents plan
and save for retirement. Our research shows that older women in the US have very low levels of
financial literacy, and the majority of women have undertaken no retirement planning.
Furthermore, financial knowledge and planning are clearly interrelated: women who display
higher financial literacy are more likely to plan and be successful planners.

Our findings can be of help to those seeking to enhance older women’s retirement
security. Both employers and governments have devoted efforts to seminars, educational
programs, and retirement planning products in the last decade, but such efforts have had only a
very mixed effect on saving patterns (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007b). One-size-fits-all programs
are unlikely to successfully address saving shortfalls among many different groups. Specifically,
insofar as financial illiteracy is widespread among women, it is doubtful that a one-time financial
education seminar can reshape long-term planning and saving decisions. Instead, programs
targeted specifically at women may be better suited to address fundamental differences in their
preferences, saving needs, and financial knowledge.
I. Empirical Strategy
The decision of how much to save for retirement is a complex one, as it requires
collecting and processing information on a large set of variables including Social Security and
pensions, inflation, and interest rates, to name a few, and also making predictions about future
values of these variables. It is also necessary for the consumer to understand compound interest,
inflation, financial markets, mortality tables, and more. Nevertheless, little research has asked
exactly how households make saving decisions, how they overcome the difficulty of making
those decisions, and whether they are financially literate enough to make well-informed choices.
These topics are of paramount importance, particularly when older households are increasingly
required to take responsibility for investing and allocating their pension wealth.
To gain insight into how households make saving decisions, we devised a module on
planning and financial literacy for the 2004 Health and Retirement Study (see Lusardi and
Mitchell 2006). The module includes three questions on financial literacy, as follows:

3

1. Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After 5
years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow:
more than $102, exactly $102, less than $102?
2. Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2%
per year. After 1 year, would you be able to buy more than, exactly the same as, or less than
today with the money in this account?
3. Do you think that the following statement is true or false? Buying a single company stock
usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.
The first two questions, which we refer to as “Interest Rate” and “Inflation,” help evaluate
whether respondents display knowledge of fundamental economic concepts and basic numeracy.
The third question, which we refer to as “Risk Diversification,” evaluates respondents’
knowledge of risk diversification, a crucial element of an informed investment decision.
The HRS module also asks respondents how they calculated their retirement saving
needs. Retirement planning is a very strong predictor of wealth accumulation (Lusardi and
Mitchell 2007a). The questions about retirement planning calculations we devised for the module
are as follows:
4. Have you ever tried to figure out how much your household would need to save for
retirement? Yes or No.
5. Have you developed a plan for retirement saving? Yes; more or less; no.
6. How often have you been able to stick to this plan: would you say always, mostly, rarely, or
never?
In what follows, we tabulate the prevalence of financial literacy and retirement calculations
among a sample of age 50+ women respondents in the 2004 HRS module on planning and

4

literacy. In addition, we assess whether the women who lack insight into these simple economic
facts also appeared to have particular difficulty devising and carrying out plans.
II. Financial Literacy and Retirement Planning
Table 1 reports the responses to the financial literacy questions for our sample of 785
women respondents to the 2004 HRS module. The Table shows that 61.9 percent of women
correctly answered the interest rate calculation question. This is a relatively easy question, so it
is surprising that so many were unable to respond correctly, particularly because these older
women have most likely made numerous decisions involving interest rates over their lifetimes
(e.g. credit card rates, mortgage financing rates, etc). Respondents were more accurate about the
inflation question, with 70.6 percent answering correctly. By contrast, only 47.6 percent of the
women respondents knew that holding a single company stock implies a riskier investment than
a stock mutual fund.

Note: This table reports the percentage of correct, incorrect, “do not know” and refusal responses

Note also that only less than half of all respondents could answer correctly both the interest
rate and inflation questions. This is a remarkably low ratio, taking into account the complex
financial calculations that households on the verge of retirement have almost surely engaged in
over their lifetimes. Also disturbing is the fact that only 29 percent of respondents could answer
all three questions correctly.

5

It is also useful to further distinguish between those offering correct answers and those
giving an incorrect answer or responding “don’t know” (abbreviated DK). The proportion of
incorrect or DK responses varies according to the question. For example, for the interest rate
item, only 11.6 percent did not know, but over one-fifth (24.7 percent) gave an incorrect answer.
On the inflation question, 12.8 percent did not know, while 14.5 percent gave a wrong answer.
The question about risk diversification elicited the most “DKs”: 39.6 percent of the sample did
not know, while a smaller fraction (12 percent) gave a wrong answer. “DK” responses are
highly correlated within individual respondents: that is, women are consistently financial
illiterate or literate. For instance, there is a 70 percent correlation between those who reply “DK”
to both the interest and the inflation questions. Erroneous answers are more scattered, with
mistakes having a correlation of only 10 percent (the highest correlation among incorrect
responses). These results confirm other findings about widespread financial illiteracy among
older adults (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007b).
Turning to the question about retirement planning, fewer than one-third of all women
respondents (30.9 percent) indicated that they had ever attempted to undertake a retirement
saving calculation. This group of respondents we call Simple Planners. The fact that we find
such a small number of planners confirms results in other papers that use a different measure of
planning (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a). It is also consistent with findings in Alan L. Gustman
and Thomas L. Steinmeier (2004) that people know little about their Social Security and pension
benefits, two of the most important components of retirement wealth.
A key advantage of our HRS module compared to previous surveys is that we are further
able to distinguish among types of planners. For the women we examine, only 58.5 percent of
those who tried to figure out how much they need to save for retirement did actually develop a

6

plan, while another handful “more or less” developed a plan (7.3 percent). Both of these we refer
to as Serious Planners. The high failure rate in terms of developing a plan underscores the
difficulty of developing retirement projections. Furthermore, of the subset of Serious Planners,
fewer than one-third (31.8 percent) were always able to stick to the plan. Close to half of the
Serious Planners said they were “mostly” able to stick to their plans (53.9 percent). The
respondents who are “always” or “mostly” able to stick to a plan are called Committed Planners.
Thus, in the sample as a whole, fewer than one-third (30.9 percent) of the older women are
Simple Planners and one-fifth (20.3 percent) are Serious Planners, leaving only 17.4 percent as
Committed Planners. Of course, households may face unexpected shocks that make them deviate
from plans, but the fact remains that few respondents have tried and succeeded at planning. In
other words, planning for retirement is difficult, few do it, and fewer still think they get it right.
III. Does Financial Literacy Affect Retirement Planning?
One explanation for why women fail to plan for retirement, or do so unsuccessfully, may
be that they are financially illiterate. Table 2 report results of a multivariate regression analysis
that sheds some light on the importance of financial literacy and its relationship to planning. The
three dependent variables reflect whether the respondent is a planner, whether she said she
developed a plan, and whether she was able to stick to her plan. The dependent variable in
Column I, in each case, takes on a value of 1 if the respondent was correct regarding the literacy
questions (else= 0); Column II adds an indicator equal to 1 if the respondent indicated she did
not know the answer to the question (else= 0); and Column III has the same dependent variable
but adds a set of demographic controls (age, race, educational attainment, marital status, being
born in the US, and being a Baby Boomer). The results depicted are marginal effects from Probit
analysis.

Financial literacy is strongly and positively associated with planning, and the results are
statistically significant at conventional levels. That is, those who give a correct answer to the
financial literacy questions are more likely to be planners (Column I). In particular, those who
understand risk diversification are much more likely to plan. In addition, knowledge about risk
diversification strongly differentiates the sophisticated from the unsophisticated respondents. Not
only does it have a much larger estimated marginal effect than being able to correctly answer the
interest and the inflation questions, but it also remains statistically significant even after
accounting for the demographic characteristics of the respondent. We also find that those who
answer “don’t know” are different from the rest of the respondents. That is, the DK group is
much less likely to plan and succeed in a planning effort, even compared to those who give an
incorrect response (Column II). Most crucial is a lack of knowledge about the working of interest
rates, which is perhaps understandable since basic numeracy is crucial for doing calculations
about retirement savings.
Column III indicates that some financial literacy indicators remain statistically significant
after controlling for demographic characteristics. For example, financial literacy still affects
planning above and beyond the effect of education. This is a particularly important result for
women in this sample, many of whom are unlikely to have higher education and are relatively
likely to be unmarried (widow, divorced or separated). In other words, there is reason to believe
that these financial literacy variables may prove very useful in explaining observed differences in
retirement savings among households.
One may argue that unobservable variables or a third factor may affect both planning and
literacy or that the desire to plan may affect financial literacy, i.e., the direction of causality does
not necessarily go from literacy to planning. In other work (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007c), we use

9

a much larger set of controls in the empirical specification and show that our results are robust.
Moreover, we address reverse causality and find strong evidence that literacy causes planning,
not the reverse.
IV. Concluding Remarks
Policymakers seek to learn whether households are effectively protected for many years
in retirement, which we have argued is intimately related to whether they know how to plan for
retirement and whether they can execute these plans effectively. Indeed, we posit that this topic
is of particular interest for women who tend to live longer than men and have shorter work
experiences and lower earnings. Our research shows that older women in the US display very
low levels of financial literacy. Moreover, the large majority of women have not done any
retirement planning calculations. Further, financial knowledge and planning are closely related:
women who display higher financial literacy are more likely to plan and be successful planners.
Our findings raise concerns about the ability of women to make sound saving and
investment decisions over a long retirement period. In an environment where individuals rather
than employers and governments are charged with handing retirement finances, it is essential that
consumers become more financially literate in order to be more successful at retirement.
Several questions are left unexplained, such as why women are so financially illiterate
and what might be the best ways to address financial literacy among this segment of the
population. We plan to address these questions in future research.
