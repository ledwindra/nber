    "abstract": "\n\nWhat explains the mixed evidence from laboratory tests of K\u0151szegi and Rabin\u2019s (2006 and later) model of expectations-based reference-dependent preferences? We investigate one hypothesis: to become (behavior-affecting) reference points, probability beliefs have to sink in\u2014being merely lagged, as the theory requires, is not sufficient. Past experiments with conflicting findings exogenously endowed subjects with beliefs that were equally lagged, but possibly unequally sunk-in. In four experiments, whose designs replicate past KR-nonsupporting experiments, we add new sink-in manipulations that endow individuals with additional, visual/physical probability impressions. Our findings are more KR-supporting in an endowment-effect setting but not in an effort-provision setting.\n\n",

I also thank Danny Kahneman for triggering off the train of thought that initiated this research, when in December 2010 he wrote in an email: \u201cThese are very clean instructions but they are almost ridiculously complicated. The students might be able to figure out how to answer the questions at the end, but I don\u2019t think any psychologist would agree that this is a good manipulation of expectations.\u201d This research project was supported by the I-CORE program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee and the Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 1821/12), and by the S.C. Johnson Graduate School of Management. The views expressed herein are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\n\n"
