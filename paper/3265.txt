DYNAMIC OPTIMAL INCOME TAXATION WITH GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT
ABSTRACT
The optimal income taxation problem has been extensively studied in oneperiod models.

This paper analyzes optimal income taxation when consumers work'

for many periods.

We also analyze what information, if any, that the

government learns about abilities in one period can be used in later periods to
attain more redistribution than in a one-period world.

When the government

must commit itself to future tax schedules, intertemporal nonstationarity of
tax schedules could relax the self-selection constraints and lead to Pareto
improvements.

The effect of nonstationarity is analogous to that of

randomization in one-period models.

The use of information is limited since

only a single lifetime self-selection constraint for each type of consumer
exists.

These results hold when individuals and the government have the same

discount rates.

The planner can make additional use of the information when

individual and social rates of time discounting differ.

In this case, the

limiting tax schedule is a nondistorting one if the government has a lower
discount rate than individuals.
