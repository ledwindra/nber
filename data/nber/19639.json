    "abstract": "\n\nEvidence from behavioral economics reveals that decision-making in health care settings can be affected by circumstances and choice architecture.  This paper conducts an analysis of choice of private Medicare plans (Medicare Advantage plans) in Miami-Dade County.  We provide a detailed description of the choice of MA plans available in Miami over much of the program's history and the composition of Medicare beneficiaries in Miami over the 2000s.  Our analysis suggests that first becoming eligible for Medicare is the key transition point for MA, and that there is significant status quo bias in the MA market.  This consumer behavior has important implications for policy that regulates the MA market.\n\n",
