Introduction
The theory of the multinational enterprise has traditionally been rather disjoint from the

theory of international

trade.

International

trade theory developed from a general-equilibrium

tradition, usually relying on the twin assumptions of constant return to scale and perfect competition
in production.

The theory of the multinational enterprise has tended to be a branch of a more

general theory of the firm, focussing on individual firms and their incentives to internally integrate
activities across geographic space.
During the last fifteen years, the theory of international trade has broadened considerably,
incorporating models based on increasing returns, imperfect competition, and in some case product
differentiation.

But the treatment of individual firms remains limited, generally detached both from

the theory of the multinational enterprise and empirical evidence. Firms are modelled as single-plant,
single-product organizations with all equity concentrated in the country of (single-plant) production.
Yet industries with strong scale economies and oligopolistic market structures are often dominated
by multinationals.
More recently, there have been attempts to endogenize multinational firms into generalequilibrium trade models. Firm-level characteristics combine with country-level characteristic

and

trade wsts to determine what types of firms exist in equilibrium. Yet the various papers are limited
in generality, in part due to severe technical challenges. Perhaps the most difficult of these is that
characterizing the types of firms in existence as a function of parameter values is inherently an
exercise in comparative statics on inequalities. Second, the dimensionality of even a minimal partialequilibrium model is large when their are alternative configurations of firms and plants.
Two branches of literature in particular remain separate.

In one, multinationals

are multi-

plant firms producing roughly the same product in different locations, substituting international
production for trade (Markusen, 1984). These models of “horizontal” multinationals are particularly

1

2
relevant empirically for investment

among the developed economies.

In the second branch,

multinationals are firms that separate activities geographically with investment leading to intra-firm
trade (Helpman,

1984).

These models of “vertical” direct investment

seem more relevant to

investments into developing economies, a category which has been historically small but which has
grown substantially during the last five years.
The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrated treatment of these models, so that
various combinations of vertical multinationals, horizontal multinationals, and strictly national firms
can arise endogenously as a function of parameter values. The parameters in question are trade
costs, differences between countries in relative and in absolute factor endowments, and investment
barriers.

and Markusen

(1992), Brainard (1993), and Markusen and Venables (1995, 1996a,b) emerges as a special case as
does the vertical model of Helpman, with extensions by Helpman and Krugman (1985), Konan (1996)
and Zhang (1996).
The model begins in a traditional fashion with two countria, two goods, and two factors. One
sector has increasing returns both at the firm (e.g., R&D) and the plant level. Trade costs may exist
between countries.

The increasing-returns indust~ has six possible firm “types”, with the types of

firms active in equilibrium denoted a “production regime”.

There are two types of single-plant

national firms (type-n firms), one for each country. These firm locate their “headquarters” activities
in the same country as their single plant.

differ significantly in size.

The “trade regime” (the direction of imports and exports), is of considerable interest in that
it can differ substantially from standard Heckscher-Ohlin theory and its trade-industrial-organization
extensions (e.g., Helpman and Krugman). While the increasing returns sector (X) is assumed skilledlabor intensive overall relative to the competitive sector (Y), multinationals can unbundle this sector
into separate activities, one of which is more skilled-labor intensive than Y (headquarters)
of which is less skilled-labor intensive (final production).

reverses the direetion of trade, with the skilled-labor-abundant

The ratio of sales by affiliates of multinationals to the sum of trade flows and affiliate sales
is of some interest.

If trade costs are low, this ratio is highest when the muntries differ significantly

in relative endowment but are of similar size (type-v firms dominate).

If trade costi are high, the

ratio is highest when the countries are similar in both relative endowments and size (type-m firms

lHorizontal multinationals do have a verticat component to them, in that the headquarters services are
supplied to the foreign branch plant. This is surely true of all multinationals: there are service flowswithin the
firm. Our distinction between vertical multinationals and horizontal multinationals is in a sense simply one of
deftition. The form is a “vertical”relationship in the sense that servicesflow in one direction and final output

We then inquire into the effects of multinationals by comparing an unrestricted equilibrium
to one in which multinationals are banned by assumption.

Results include the following.

First,

investment liberalization can, in some cases, reverse the direction of trade and/or increase the volume
of trade.

Second, investment liberalization (like trade liberalization in more traditional models)

produces a strong tendency toward factor-price equalization.

Thus direct investment and trade can

be complements in both a volume-of-trade sense and in a welfare sense.
Throughout the paper, we will try to indicate the empirical relevance of certain situations and
the potentially testable predictions generated by the model.

Model Structure
The model has two countries (h and f) producing two homogeneous goods, Y and X. There

are two factors of production, L (unskilled labor), and S (skilled labor). L and S are mobile between
industries but internationally immobile. Y will be used as numeraire throughout the paper. Skilled
labor is used for the Grin-specific f~ed cost of producing X, and plant-specific f~ed wsts use a
combination of the two labor types. Unskilled labor is used in variable rests, and in addition there
are transport nsts between countries, specified as units of unskilled labor per unit of X exported.
Subscripts (i)j) will be used to denote the countries (f,h). The output of Y in country i is a
CES function, identical in both countries. The production function for Y is

(1)

where LiYand S iYare the unskilled and skilled labor used in the Y sector in country i. The elasticity
of substitution (1/(1-•)) is set at 5.0 in the simulation runs reported later in the paper.
Superscripts (n,v,m) will be used to daignate a variable as referring to national firms, vertical
multinationals,

and horizontal multinational firms respectively.

(m i , vi , n i ) will also be used to

indicate the number of active m, v, and n firms based in country i. Hopefully, it will always be clear
from the context what is being represented (e.g., ni as a variable in an equation always refers to the
number of national firms in country i).
The quantification of fwed costs in the X sector is of considerable importance in this model.

requirements.

Several assumptions guide us in specifying the relative values of freed-cost parameters.

But type-v firms will need to draw some of this skilled labor from the

country in which the plant is located (F; > O). For type-n firms, all of these skilled labor
requirements will be drawn from the headquarters’ country.

required for single-plant type-n and type-v firms, but much less than double the amount (2F~ > F?

are no type-vfums. The technology-transfercost (F7 > F?) is motivated by empirical results, especially those

cost penalty these two fums could be exchanged for one type-v~ f~m and one type-vf firm and we would still
have an equilibrium (total factor demands in each country are unchanged, etc.). Thus the equilibrium is
degenerate. Our assumption of the l~o cost penalty seems very realistic, and avoids this technical problem.
4We assume that sktied workers cannot be used in X production (e.g., “unskilled workers” actually have
manual/mechanical skiUs that cannot be used in R&D, and vice versa for the skiUs of “skilled workers”). We
could assume that skilled workers have the same productivity in X as unskitled workers, effectively binding the
skilled-uskilled wage ratio to a lower bound of 1. This would add 12 more inequalities to the model. In the

parameterization we use, such a lower bound is almost never binding, exceptwhen mtitinationals are prohibited
(used for compwison purposes), in whichcase the ratio is less than one in equilibrium in about 10% of the factor
box.

we assume to be the same in both directions. In our calibration, national firms in the X sector are
moderately more skilled-labor intensive that Y-sector firms.
A horizontal multinational based in country i has sales in country j, X~j . It operates one
plant in each muntry incurring freed costs, (Gm, F~ ) in its base country, and fixed costs (Gm, F;
) in country j. Sales are met entirely from local production not trade. L~j (S~j ) denotes a country
i horizontal multinational firm’s demand for unskilled (skilled) labor in country j. A firm type m i thus
has a cost function

In our calibration, horizontal multinational firms are generally more skilled-labor intensive
than national and vertical multinational firms, using more skilled labor for branch-plant fixed rests
versus the additional unskilled labor for transport costs used by national or vertical firms.

In a Cournot model with homogeneous products, the optimal markup formula is given by the

To summarize the X sector in the model, the twelve inequalities (9)-(14) are associated with
the twelve output levels (two each for six firm types), the twelve equations in (15) are associated with
the twelve markups, and the six inequalities in (16)-(21) are associated with the number of firms of

11
each type. Additionally goods prices are given by (8), income levels from (6) and factor prices from
factor market clearing equation (5) together with labor demand from the Y sector.
The model is quite complex for two reasons. First, a bare-bones partial equilibrium version
of the model would involve 30 non-linear inequalities as just noted.

Second, it is a problem of

comparative statics on inequalities, making traditional analytical, comparative-statics

methods of

limited value. The problems introduced by inequalities are compounded by the factor that we have
five different

production

multinational-firm

activities (Y, X-sector output,

national-firm

fixed costs, horizontal

fried costs, vertical multinational-firm fixed costs), all using factors in different

proportions. 5
We did manage to make considerable analytical progress in two of our earlier papers,
Markusen and Venables (1995, 1996a,b). In the former we did this by examining a simplified partial
equilibrium model (a model of the model) and in the latter by adopting a monopolistic-competition
framework with f~ed markup rules, and only three firm types. In both models, production and all
fixed cost activities use factors in the same proportion and there are no vertical multinationals are
permitted.

In the next section, we will try to gain some intuition by reviewing analytical results from

our earlier papers with appropriate extensions, and later in the paper simulate the full model which
involves 51 non-linear inequalities using Rutherford’s (1995) non-linear complementarily

solver.

5Reviewing points made separately earlier, type-m fums are moderately more skilled-labor intensive than
type-vf~ms which are moderately more skilled-laborintensive than national firms which are moderately more
skilled-labor-intensive than Y production in our calibrations. But many of the interestbg factor-mmket effects
that we identify are driven by geographical rearrangement of activities when multinationals are allowed to enter
rather than by the skilled-labor intensities of type-n or type-v fums versus type-m fums versus Y production per
se.

General

Discussion

A brief review of our earlier separate results maybe in order (Markusen and Venables, 1995,
1996a,b Konan, 1996, Zhang, 1996), along with some conjectures about how they will relate to one
another in a more general model. First, consider the basic determinants of the production regime,
defined as the set of firm types active in equilibrium. A basic feature of the model is that horizontal
multinationals have multi-plant economies of scale, in that the total freed costs for a two-plant firm
are less than double the f~ed costi for a one-plant firm. Given the parameterization

of the model

noted above, at the equilibrium factor prims prevailing in free trade the f~ed costs of a type-m firm
are about 1.52 times the f~ed costs of a type-n or type-v firm.

The latter are low freed-cost

organizations, but they must incur transport costs in serving a foreign market.

The advantage of a

type-v firm over a type-n firm in turn lies in the possibility of international differences in factor prices:
large difference give the type-v firm an advantage in that it can locate each of its two activities in
different countries according to factor-price differences. The broad determinants of the equilibrium
production regime are as follows.
Production Re~ime
Type-m firms will tend to dominate when
Firm-level scale economies are high relative to plant-level scale economies
Total world demand is high
Trade costs are moderate to high
Countries are similar in relative factor endowmenk
Countries are similar in size.
TWe-n firms will tend to dominate when
Trade costs are low and countries are similar in relative endowments and si~
Trade costs are moderate and countries are ve~ different in size.
Type-v firms will tend to dominate when
Trade costs are moderate to low, and countries differ significantly in relative endowments.
Some of this is fairly obvious, but a few comments about the roles of relative endowments and
muntry sizes are appropriate.

When trade barriers are moderate, type-m firms tend to have an

13
advantage over type-n or type-v firm when the countries are similar in relative endowments and size.
Neither country has an advantage in terms of a single plant, and the added fixed costs of having two
plants outweighs the trade costs incurred by a one-plant firm. But if the muntries are very different,
then one of them has an advantage, either in terms of being a much larger market or in terms of
having factor prices that favor X sector production.

Single-plant firms located in this advantaged

muntry then have an advantage over two-plant horizontal multinationals in that the latter must locate
costly capacity in a small and/or high-rest market. Thus the association of horizontal multinationals
with similar countries.
When single-plant firms dominate, the qumtion of type-n firms versus type-v firms turns on

offsetting advantage.

If factor prices are roughly equalized with type-n firms dominating, then
There is a cost penalty to splitting headquarters

and plant, and no

When factor-prices are very different across the two countries, then there is

an advantage in splitting the two activities, with the headquarters in country with cheap skilled labor
and the plant in the country with cheap unskilled labor. Our conjecture is then that type-v firms
should be able to enter when the two countries are very different in relative endowments so that
factor prices are not equalized when only type-n firms produce.

But differences in country sizes

should not support type-v firms in equilibrium.
In the earlier work of Markusen and Venable, the mmparison of horizontal multinationals
with national firms suggested that multinationals tend to reduce the volume of trade in goods as
exports of “producer services” (e.g., blueprints,

managerial services) substitutes

for trade in

commodities. The addition of type-v firms make that less clear, as articles by Konan and Zhang show.
Investment liberalization can lead to a reversal in the direction of trade as previously integrated firms,
for example, begin to export component and producer sefices and re-import a large share of finished
(assembled) products from a subsidia~ in a smaller, unskilled-labor abundant country.

Similar

14
circumstance might lead to an increase in the volume of trade following trade liberalization.
Another possibility that investment liberalization can increase the volume of trade lies in the
fact that, in the absence of multinationals,

“comparative advantage” in X is determined

by a

combination of country size and relative endowment factors. The country relatively well endowed
with skilled labor has a comparative advantage in X, but the larger of two countries also has such a
comparative advantage due to a “home market effect” familiar from the trade-industrial organization
literature.

When a count~ is large, but scarce in skilled labor it may export X, but have a high price

for skilled labor constraining its specialization and exports.

The entry of type-v firms in such a

situation basically relaxes this constraint by locating headquarters in the small, skilled-labor abundant
country thereby leading to an increase in the volume of trade.
There is an interesting question about the volume of sales by affiliates of multinationals
relative to trade, something that is amenable to empirical examination. Our model should predict that
this ratio is high under the circumstance outline above so that horizontal multinationals dominate in
equilibrium. But it may also be moderately high when vertical multinationals dominate in equilibrium.
Unfortunately,

this leads to a less-than-sharp prediction.

If trade costs are high, then affiliate

production relative to trade should be highest when the countries are similar in size and in relative
endowments (type-m firms dominate). If trade costs are low, then affiliates should have a high share
when the countries are very different in relative endowments (type-v firms dominate).

These

conjectures are summarized as follows.
Trade Repime
The entry of multinationals (removal of an investment ban) may reverse the direction of trade in X
when the muntries differ significantly in relative endowments.
The entry of multinationals may increase the volume of trade when one country is larger but is
relative well endowed with umkilled labor.

15
The ratio of affiliate sales to the volume of trade plus affiliate sales is high when (a) trade costs are
low and the muntries differ significantly in relative size, (b) trade barriers are moderate to high and
the countries are similar in both relative endowments and size.
Finally, there are interesting questions concerning how multinationals affect factor prices, a
subject we addressed in Markusen and Venables, 1996a. We noted that the ent~ of horizontal
multinationals generated a tendenq

toward international factor-price equalization in almost all cases.

Those results should be reinforced herewith the addition of vertical multinationals.

As noted above,

type-v firms in this model are creatures of situations where factor prices are unequal in their absence.
Allowing direct investment leads firms to fragment and rearrange X-sector activities, putting more
R&D in the skilled-labor-abundant

country and more production in the unskilled-labor-abundant

country, thus moving the world toward factor-price equalization.

we use, the skilled-unskilled wage rate at the center point of the

factor box is very steep; although this wage ratio is about 1.4S though the center, there are actually
many more units of unskilled labor than skilled labor, so that geometrically the factor-price ratio is
very steep. The point of mentioning this is that country size effects are very important in this model
in some cases, and in effect country h is smaller (in total income) at all points left of column 10 and
larger at all points to the right of column 10 in all of the diagrams.

national firms operate, flanked by areas in which there is a mixture of type-n and type-v firms. In
the northwest corner only type-v (v~ ) firms are active in equilibrium and similarly an area of only
type-v (v ~) firms in the southeast corner. Obviously, these are regions in which only the unskilledIabor-abundant country produces X while all headquarters are located in the skilled-labor abundant
country. b

an opportunity for type-v firms to enter. The middle panel of Figure 1 shows similar results, with a
quantitative difference in that the region in which only national firms are active shrinks.
The bottom panel of Figure 1 with

T =

.10 provides an integrated case that cannot be found

in previous writings (Zhang, 1996) suggests this in a partial-equilibrium model. All six firm types exist
in some region of the factor box (again, see the appendix for a complete characterization).

In the

central region, type-m firms exist; only type-m firms exist in the core of this region while the outer
edges are generally a mixture of type-m and type-n firms. Horizontal multinationals exist when the
countries are relatively similar in size and in relative factor endowments, a point emphasized by
Markusen and Venables (1995, 1996a,b). 7
As the countries become increasing different in relative factor endowments, factor prices
become unequal, creating an opportunity for type-v firms to enter in the manner we have already
discussed. When countries differ in relative endowments but are also veq different in size, there is
a mixture of national and multinational firms (relevant to all three panels).
For example, near the lower left-hand edge of all three panels, types n ~and v ~firms exist in
equilibrium (see appendix). Country h is relatively well endowed with skilled labor making it suitable
for headquarters activities, but it is too small to support all such activity. Thus type n ~firms exist as
well. All final production occurs in the large, unskilled-labor-abundant

country.

This case may be

relevant to some small, but skilled-labor abundant countries such as Sweden, Switzerland, and The
Netherlands.

These countries are home to many multinationals, but much of their production occurs

abroad.
Zhang (1996) notes an interesting hypothesis that follows from these results: as a developing
country begins to catch up in both size and in relative endowments, we might see it first attract

Trade Regimes

three panels corresponding to Figure 1. By “exports of S“, we are referring to services of skilled labor
embodied in the headquarters services supplied to foreign plants by multinationals (skilled labor in
not itself internationally mobile).

Thus there are two traded goods in the model, X and Y, and a

traded service. If for example only type-v~ firms existed in equilibrium, then these firm are providing
headquarters services to country f in exchange for markup revenues which would likely be repatriated
in terms of X. Country h might either import or export Y, but statistics would show a net deficit for
country h in trade in goods only, the balancing item being the “invisible” service flow to foreign plants.
The top panel of Figure 2 (costless or free trade) shows that country h exports X for points
above, but not too far above the diagonal.
skilled-labor-intensive

This follows from the fact that the X sector overall is

relative to the Y sector.

But when the difference in relative endowments

becomes large, factor-price equalization fails to hold and it bemmes profitable for type-v~ firms to
enter.

These firms unbundle the X-sector activities into headquarters services (more skilled-labor-

intensive than Y) and final production (less skilled-labor-intensive than Y). In the northwest corner
area of Figure 2, country h then exports Y and S, and imports X.
The large unshaded region to the northwest of the center point in the middle panel in which
country h imports X and exports S and Y requires some explanation (types v ~and n ~firms are active
in equilibrium over most of this region). Some point in this region actually lie below the diagonal.
Driving this result is a country size effect, which will appear several times in our results. Two effects
drive “comparative advantage” in this model as we noted earlier: relative endowments and country
size. Due to the scale economies in X and the nature of markup determination, location in the larger
market is advantageous for a firm in the presence of trade costs, because most of the firm’s sales are
in its low-cost market. In the absence of multinationals, the larger country will be the headquarters

20
country for most national firms (out of proportion to country size differences) and be the exporter
of X along the SW-NE diagonal of the factor box. But since the relative endowments of the two
countries are the same, this must in turn imply that the relative price of skilled labor is higher in the
large country. That in turn implies that if multinationals are permitted, type-v firms headquartered
in the small country will enter in equilibrium.
The bottom panel of Figure 2 adds a central region in which there is no trade in X (all X is
produced by type-m firms), with peripheral regions in which one country imports both X and Y in
exchange for exports of services. For example, in cell row 17 and column 8 in the lower panel, type
v~ and m ~firms exist in equilibrium (see appendix). All firms are headquartered

in h and a very high

service export volume is matched by imports of both X and Y.
Some recent empirical evidence suggests that the volume of direct investment in the world
economy has been growing faster than the volume of trade, ~pecially among the developed countries,
over the last two dwades.

There has been a large increase in the flow of direct investment from

developed to developing countries over the las five years, although the stock of direct investment in
developing countries remains fairly small.
Figure 3 considers the volume of sales by foreign affiliates of type-m and type-n firms divided
by that amount plus the total volume of trade in X and Y. 8 It takes on a value of zero when there
are only type-n firm in existence and may have a value of one when there are only type-m firms. 9
When trade costs are low or zero, the statistic is small or zero near the center of the factor box and
when the countries differ in size but not in relative endowments (type-n firms dominate in these

%here are several alternative statistics which could be used. One is to consider ordy arm’s length trade in
X in the denominator, so that for example X export by type-vh fums from the plant in f to h are not counted.
We found no strong reason to prefer one statistic over another.
9Having ordy type-m firms is not sufficient for a value of one. If more of these firms are headquartered in
one country, that country will be a net exporter of S and a net importer of Y. Thus some commodity trade still
occurs in equilibrium.

21
areas). But it can take on values in the .30-.50 range when the countries are significantly different
in relative endowments but similar in size (type-v firms dominate).
unequal factor prim

Once again, this is the result of

in spite of free trade that create opportunities for type-v firms.

As trade costs bemme higher in the bottom panel of Figure 3, the central region changes very
substantially with horizontal multinational firms replacing national firms. The statistic at and near the
center in fact jumps from zero to one. Now the affiliate sales ratio is highest when the countries are
similar in both size and in relative endowments.

But it remains moderately high when the countries

are very different in relative endowments but similar in size, and near zero when the countries are
very different in size. This gives us some sharp empirical predictions, but unfortunately the affiliate
sales ratio between very similar countries is greatly sensitive to the level of trade costs.

Assessing the Effects
Suppressed

of Multinationals

by Counterfactual:

Multinationals

While much has been written on the “effects on multinationals”, often it is not clear to what
multinationals are being mmpared.

What is the munterfactual

against which to judge these effects?

In our case, the most obvious alternative is to simply compute equilibria in which multinationals are
banned by assumption, thus suppressing type-v and type-m firms. Only types n~ and n ~can exist in
equilibria, converting the model into a standard example of the “new trade theory”.
Figure 4 illustrates the trade regime for the three values of trade costs used in the preceding
figures, ~ = .00, .05, and .10. The striking feature of all three diagrams is the tension of relative
endowment

versus country size in determining the direction of trade in X. Since X cannot be

fragmented, it is skilled-labor-intensive overall relative to Y, and so the skilled-labor-abundant

country

tends to export X. But the X sector has increasing returns to scale and hence has this home-market
effect mentioned

several times earlier.

This gives the larger of two countries

a “comparative

advantage” in X production and exports. 10
These effects come across quite clearly in all three panels of Figure 4. If auntry
relatively skilled-labor-abundant

h is

(points above the SW-NE diagonal), it exports X unless it is

“significantly” smaller, where the critical value of size decreases with the difference in relative
endowments.

Converse comments apply to country f. Some non-monotonicity

occurs in the top

panel (free trade) such as row 10. Moving from left to right, country h first imports X as the countryside effect dominates, and then exports X as the relative-endowment effect dominates.
diagonal the direction of trade reverses again (but this is the relative-endowment

Crossing the

1°Recti that the factor-price ratio through the center point is very steep, so effectivelycountry h is larger
in income at all points to the right of column 10. If ~
country size mattered, the hatched area of country h
exporting X in Figure 4 would be all points in the right-hand half of the diagram. If only relative endowments
mattered, the hatched area would be all point above the SW-NE diagonal as in the Heckscher-Ohlin model. The
Helpman-Krugman (1985) reproduces the usual Heckscher-Ohlin result because, with freed markup rules, there
are no country size effects.

23
to dominate) and eventually trade reverse a final time as the country-size effect once again dominates.
Figure 5 puts the information of Figura 2 and 4 together to produce maps of regions where
the direction of trade is reversed with the removal of the investment ban. In all three panels, trade
in X reverses direction in the northwest and southeast regions. Basically, this is intuitive in terms of
previous results.

With multinationals banned, X sector production integrated in one location is

skilled-labor-intensive

relative to Y production.

Thus the skilled-labor abundant country exports X

as just noted. But factor-prices are unequal in these regions, with skilled labor being cheaper in the
skilled-labor-abundant

country.

Thus if multinationals can enter, type-v ~ firms will enter in the

northwest corner, fragment production, concentrating headquarters activities at home and locating
more unskilled-labor-intensive

final production in country f.

The shaded regions of trade reversal in the top panel of Figure 5 are considerably harder to
understand,

in part because our intuitive stories tend to follow partial-equilibrium

reasoning.

Consider the shaded region in the southwest area of the top panel. Without multinationals, country
h imports X since the country-size effect dominates the relative-endowment
earlier.

effect as we noted

But muntry h also has a relatively low price for skilled labor in this region.

Thus if

multinationals are permitted, type-v ~firms will enter, relocating headquarters activities toward country
h. But this drives up the price of skilled labor in country h. In general-equilibrium,

the solution is

to reallocate resources in country h, from the Y sector to final X production, the latter being less
skilled-labor intensive than Y. So invatment
most skilled-labor-intensive

liberalization leads to a reallocation of resources to the

activity (headquarters)

and to the least skilled-labor-intensive

activi~

(final production) and out of the intermediate activity Y. This reversal in the direction of trade in
X in this SW region does not occur in the bottom two panek of Figure 5 (increased trade costs affect
the direction of trade with multinationals (Figure 2), but not without (Figure 4) in this SW region).
Figure 6 plots results as to how the volume of mmmodity trade changes with investment

24
liberalization, the hatched areas being regions of increased trade following investment liberalization.
Investment and trade in goods could be termed complements in a volume sense in these regions.
Roughly speaking, the results indicate that the investment liberalization increases the volume of trade
when the moderately skilled-labor abundant country is also moderately smaller.
These results are not easy to interpret.

In each of the panels of Figure 6, some of the

hatched points of increased trade volume coincide with point of trade-direction reversal in Figure 5
while the majority do not. What is true is that all of the hatched points in all panels of Figure 6
involve mixed regimes type-n and type-v firms when multinationals are permitted.

No points involve

type-v firms only (and obviously not type-n firms only).
The second interesting feature of these hatched point of increased trade volume is that almost
all of them involve essentially no change in the gross volume of X sector trade, indeed many involve
a small fall in this volume. What accounts for the increased trade volume is an increase in the net
volume of X sector trade and a rise in the volume of Y trade (note that net trade in X and trade in
Y need not be the same because of trade in services). Thus, while the gross volume of trade in X
is not increasing, there is a fall in intra-industry (cross-hauling) trade in X as countries become more
specialized.

The country with the lower price for skilled labor in the absence of multinationals

bemmes more specialized in headquarters’ servi~s and less specialized in final production when
investment is liberalized.

In the left-hand “blob” of hatched points in the middle panel of Figure 6

for example, country h becomes more specialized in Y and S and less specialized in X production
when investment is liberalized. At some of the upper points in this blob the direction of trade in X
is reversed, from exporting to importing X while in the lower point imports of Y are reinforced by
investment liberalization.
The only exception to this result is some points at the extreme right and left-hand edges of
the upper panel of Figure 6, where investment liberalization does lead to increased intra-industry

25
trade in X, and to very little change in the net volume of trade in X.
example, invatment

At the left-hand edge for

liberalization leads to a switch in the direction of trade in X as we noted above,

with country h exporting X after liberalization (country h switches from being relatively specialized
in Y to being relatively specialized in headquarters services and final X production).

This generates

more cross hauling of X with little increase in the net trade in X (just a reversal in direction).

equalization.

In each diagram, most of the area in the top panel has a value of z fi~ of between 98%

and 102.0470 (inverse of 98Yo) of its value at the center point of the factor box. It is interesting to
note that the size of this region is not very sensitive to the level of trade costs.
The bottom panels in Figures 7-9 tell a rather different story. Factor prices diverge rather
sharply from the center point as muntries become different in relative endowments.

The degree of

divergence again is not very sensitive to trade costs, except that the size of the 98Yo-102% region
bemmes very small with non-zero trade costs.
The diagrams suggest that investment liberalization generates a strong tendency toward factorprice equalization regardless of whether the entering firms are type-v firms or type-m firms (central
region of Figure 9). We have already commented on the role of factor-price differences in inducing
entry of type-v firms. Briefly, unequal factor prices induce the entry of type-v firms, which fragment
the X sector, locating skilled-labor-intensive headquarters activities in the country where S is cheap
(generally the skilled-labor-abundant

country) and final production where L is cheap.

creates a pressure toward factor-price equalization.

This then

In the case of type-m firms, they do something

similar. Since there is only one headquarters, the potential type-m firm chooses the country in which
skilled labor is cheaper.

In general equilibrium, this creates a similar pressure toward factor-price

27
equalization.
Our final results in Figure 10 plot areas in which the removal of a prohibitive investment ban
might lead to a fall in welfare (hatched areas). 11 Using good Y as numeraire

and setting

expenditure shares equal to 1/2 as in our simulations, the indirect utility function for country h is

Thus changes in welfare can arise either from factor-price changes or a change in the price of X.
Although the general-equilibrium

effects do not permit a very simple answer, most of the hatched

points in Figure 10 are associated with a rise in p, for country h following the removal of an
investment ban. In the hatched areas in the upper left-hand corners, recall that the direction of trade
actually reverses following investment liberalization, with country h having to import X from country
f. In the hatched regions on the far right, the removal of the investment ban is associated with a
transfer of production of X from country h to country f in most but not all of the hatched cells. We
think that this is interpreted as a loss of home-market advantage for country h, with an associated
loss of X production and rise in price. In any case, it is possible for invatment

liberalization to leave

a country worse off if it is (a) small but very well endowed with skilled labor, or (b) large and
somewhat abundant in unskilled labor.

llWe have tried to avoid putting any emphasis on quantitative results in this paper. Since this is a pure
simtiation model, numericaJ values seem to have no particular interpretation. We break the silence here and
note that in ahnost all of the hatched points of Figure 10, the welfare loss following trade liberalization is less
than 1%.

Summa~ and Conclusions
The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrated treatment of a number of strand of

literature in which one sector of the economy produces with increases returns to scale and imperfect
competition.

One branch is often referred to as the “new trade theory” in which single-plant national

firms compete with national firms of another country in the international market place. A second
branch involves endogenous “horizontal” multinational firms which choose between serving a foreign
market by exports and serving it by building a branch plant.

A third branch involves “vertical”

multinationals which maintain single plants, but which geographically separate headquarters
from production.

activity

In the present paper, all of these models arise as special cases for some set of

parameter values.
(1) Our first task was to characterize the production regime: the types of firms active in
equilibrium.

Broadly speaking, single-plant national firms (with headquarters

and the plant in the

same location) dominate in equilibrium when the countries are similar in relative endowments and
dissimilar in size. They can also arise when sizes are similar provided trade costs are low. Vertical
multinationals

(one plant with headquarters

and plant in different countries) dominate when the

countries are sufficiently dissimilar in relative endowments but somewhat similar in size. Two-plant
horizontal multinationals dominate when the countries are similar in size and in relative endowments,
and trade costs are moderate to high.
(2) We then examined the trade regime: which countries export X, Y, and services. Here
the assumptions on factor intensities are crucial. Integrated production of X is more skilled-laborintensive than Y but decomposing X, headquarters
production is less skilled-labor-intensive

activities use only skilled labor and final X

than Y. Results indicate that the skilled-labor-abundant

country is like to import X (vertical multinationals headquartered in that country dominate) when the
countries are different in relative endowments but not extremely different in size.

29
(3) An interesting statistic which is often cited empirically (although measured in a variety

of ways) is the ratio of sales by affiliate of multinationals to that amount plus the volume of
commodity trade.

Our results indicate that this ratio is moderately high when the countries differ

significantly in relative endowments (vertical multinationals dominate).

It is very high if trade costs

are moderate to high and the countries are similar in both relative endowments and size (but zero
under the latter circumstance if trade costs are zero).
(4)

We introduced

an explicit munter-factual

against which to judge the effects of

multinationals by running the model with multinationals suppressed (e.g., a prohibitive investment
ban).

Several interesting results follow. First, over a considerable subset of the parameter space

examined, the removal on an investment ban reverses the direction of trade in X. The multinational’s
ability to fragment production into skilled-labor-intensive and unskilled-labor-intensive
means, for example, that the skilled-labor-abundant

activit ies often

country switches from exporting to importing X

(but exporting headquarters services) following the removal of a ban.
Investment

liberalization can also lead to an increase in the volume of trade.

In most

instances when this happens, it appears to be driven by increased specialization within the X sector
and a fall in intra-industry trade in X. So, for example, the skilled-labor-abundant
concentrate

on headquarters

country may

activities following investment liberalization and the other country

concentrate more on final production.

While the total trade in X may not change at all, net trade

increases and so the balancing volume of trade in Y increases.
(5) A final section of the paper considered factor prices and welfare, again using the counterfactual of an investment ban as a standard for comparison. We showed that investment liberalization
created a strong tendency toward factor-price equalization at all levels of trade costs. The overall
welfare effects of investment liberalization for a country are more complex and puzzling.

Cases

where a country loses from liberalization are generally associated with the country having high levels

30
of X production

and exports without multinationals, but having that advantage eroded following

investment liberalization.

This is consistent with established understanding

about “home market

advantages” in scale-intensive industries.
(6) A a final comment, we might point out how fragile the “strategic-trade-policy” literature
looks in light of our results.

That literature focusses on cases of single-plant, domestically-owned

brrns competing against like firms from the other country. This type of situation does exist in our
model, but over a very small part of parameter space (whatever that might measure). And of course,
it is clear that small changes in trade costs or other policy parameters might induce a regime shift,
so that the policy prescription based on an exogenous regime may be completely inappropriate.
