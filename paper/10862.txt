ABSTRACT
The Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study shows a large increase in
reported total wealth between 1993 and 1995. Such an increase is not found in other US household
surveys around that period. This paper examines one source of this difference. We find that in
AHEAD 1993 ownership rates of stocks, CDs, bonds, and checking and saving accounts were underreported, resulting in under-measurement of wealth in 1993, and a substantial increase in wealth
from 1993 to 1995. The explanation for the under-reporting is a combination of question sequence
and wording in the AHEAD survey instrument.

1. Introduction
The Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study collects panel
data from households with at least one person who was 70 or over at baseline in 1993.
Because of its large sample and broad coverage of life domains, the AHEAD is widely
used to study the behavior and economic status of the elderly population in the US.
However, simple descriptive analysis shows a remarkable feature: average total wealth
increased from $165 thousand in 1993 to $256 thousand in 1995, an increase of about
$90 thousand or more than 50%. Yet, average household income was just $26 thousand
in 1993 and subsequent waves exhibit no such strong increases in total wealth. Taken at
face value, the implication is the AHEAD cohorts had extraordinarily high rates of return
between 1993 and 1995 because they could not possibly have saved the wealth increase
out of income.
Comparison with other US household surveys shows that this pattern is unique to
the AHEAD study. The most comparable household study in sampling and survey design
is the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). According to the HRS, the increase in wealth
among those aged 51-61 in 1992 was 14% between 1992 and 1994 and 11% between
1994 and 1996. These returns suggest a rate of increase of 12-13% between 1993 and
1995, which is much lower than in AHEAD despite the HRS cohort being in its high
saving ages. Similarly, the 1992 and 1995 cross-sections of the Survey of Consumer
Finances (SCF) show no large wealth increases in the age bands 65-74 and 75 or over.
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the details of the large increase in
wealth between waves 1 and 2 of AHEAD. We conclude that a large part of the increase
was the result of an underestimation of the frequency of ownership in several financial

2

asset categories in wave 1 and that the underestimation was due to an anomaly in the
design of the survey instrument in that wave.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives some
background information on the AHEAD study. Section 3 provides further details on
asset ownership in the various waves. Section 4 describes the aspects of the
questionnaire that we argue are responsible for the underreporting of asset ownership in
wave 1. The final Section concludes.

2. The AHEAD Data
Our data come from the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest-Old
(AHEAD).1 This study is a panel survey of individuals born in 1923 or earlier and their
spouses. At baseline in 1993 it surveyed 8,222 individuals from the community-based
population, including oversamples of blacks, Hispanics, and Floridians. When weighted,
the sample is representative of the national community-based population. Wave 2 was
fielded in 1995, wave 3 was collected in 1998, and thereafter, households have been reinterviewed every two years.
The main goal of AHEAD is to provide panel data from the three broad domains of
economic status, health and family structure. In wave 1 individuals and couples were asked
for a complete inventory of assets and debts and about income sources. Through the use of
unfolding brackets, nonresponse to asset values was reduced to levels much lower than
would be found in a typical household survey such as the SIPP.2 To reduce respondent
burden and to improve data quality, couples were requested to designate the person most

knowledgeable about financial matters to be the financial respondent. All questions about
income and assets for the household were then put to the financial respondent.
Although we mainly use waves 1 and 2, we will also present data from waves 3 and
4 for comparative purposes.

3. Wealth Components
Table 1 shows mean and median wealth (nominal dollars) in AHEAD and HRS. In
AHEAD average wealth increased by about 55% between 1993 and 1995. The increase
in the median was much smaller, 21%. Such a large increase does not accord with the
life-cycle model in which households of this age should be dissaving and it does not
accord with observed rates of saving in other data.3 Furthermore there is no comparable
change between 1995, 1998 and 2000, as would be suggested by a continuation of the
behavior between 1993 and 1995.
The contrast with HRS is obvious, as is seen in Table 1: over the same period
wealth increased in a steady manner and continued to do so beyond 1996. The increase
observed in the HRS data accords with life-cycle behavior and with other data.4
Table 2 shows the components of wealth in AHEAD. The majority of the
increase in mean total wealth in AHEAD between 1993 and 1995 stems from the large
increase in mean financial assets of about $70k. All components of financial assets
increased over the two years. This increase is particularly notable because financial
wealth was approximately constant in subsequent waves. The remainder of the increase

3

For example, in the first wave of the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS), the average rate
of saving out of after-tax income among those 75 or over in 2001 was –5.6% (Hurd and Rohwedder, 2004).
In CAMS saving is measured as the difference between disposable household income and total household
spending and so it has no dependence on capital gains.
4
In CAMS wave 1 the saving rate among households aged 55-59 was about 20% out of after-tax income.

4

in total wealth was in IRA/KEOGH accounts and in business wealth. This suggests that
we ought to study further the reasons of the increases above all in financial wealth, but
also investigate the increases in value of IRAs and business.
We observe very large increases between 1993 and 1995 in all the components of
financial wealth. In contrast the values of these components were quite stable from 1995
on. By itself this table does not establish that the increase in total wealth is the result of a
survey flaw: stock holders could have experienced very large gains between 1993 and
1995 and reallocated some of those gains to the other asset categories. We note,
however, that the large sustained gains in the stock market began at about the beginning
of 1996.5 For stock market gains to be the explanation, AHEAD stockholders would
have achieved much higher rates of return than the returns experienced by the broad stock
market. We will return to this issue below.
Table 3 shows ownership rates among AHEAD households for each of the
components of financial assets in the various waves. These are cross-section prevalence
rates. Thus in 1993, 20.2% of households owned stocks or mutual funds whereas by
1995 the ownership rate had increased to 30.8 percent.6 In the two subsequent waves the
ownership rate increased gradually in line with a slow population-wide increase in stock
ownership that accompanied the stock market boom. Ownership rates in the other
components of financial wealth show similar strong increases between waves 1 and 2.
Checking and saving accounts are widely held and the ownership rate varied by just 0.7
percentage points over waves 2, 3 and 4, yet the rate of ownership increased by eight
percentage points between waves 1 and 2. Similarly, between waves 1 and 2, CD

5

From June 1993 to June 1995 the New York Stock Exchange Index increased at an annual rate of about
8%. From June 1995 to June 1996 it increased by about 23%.
6
These ownership rates exclude item nonresponse to ownership status. Item nonresponse to ownership is
low and stable: for example, for stock ownership it was 2.4% in 1993, 1.7% in 1995 and 2.7% in 1998.

5

holdings increased by 10 percentage points, and bond holdings increased by 3.6
percentage points, representing a relative increase of 61%.
We would expect some increase in IRAs and Keoghs as people roll DC accounts
into them. Indeed we see a modest increase from wave 1 to 2, which does not seem out
of line with the increases in subsequent waves. The rate of business ownership increased
by about 3.4 percentage points. The increase is at least partly explained by the inclusion
of farm ownership in business assets in waves 2 through 4 but not in wave 1.
This increase in the ownership rates of financial assets is unparalleled in other
surveys. Table 4 displays the ownership rates for the same asset categories in the HRS.
Stock and mutual fund ownership increased by 3.2 percentage points between 1992 and
1994 and by an additional 0.1 percentage point between 1994 and 1996. The ownership
rate of checking and savings increased slightly but the rates of ownership of CDs and
bonds actually decreased between 1992 and 1994.
For comparison, Table 5 shows ownership rates for financial assets in the SCF.
These rates were stable or possibly even falling between 1992 and 1995. For example, in
the age bands 65-74 and 75 or over the ownership rate of stocks increased by about two
percentage points between 1992 and 1995 but the ownership rates of mutual funds fell.
Without knowing the overlap in stock and mutual fund ownership we cannot give an
ownership rate that corresponds to the AHEAD aggregate category, but there is certainly
no suggestion of any large increase. Both bond ownership and CD ownership fell in the
SCF data.
The AHEAD evidence we have presented is from successive cross-sections. To
show that changes in composition in the cross-sections are not responsible for the
observed change in ownership rates, Table 6 presents ownership rates for households that
were interviewed in all of the first three waves of AHEAD. We observe similarly large
6

increases in the rates of ownership of stocks and mutual funds, checking and saving
accounts, CDs and bonds.
We conclude that ownership of financial assets as measured in AHEAD increased
sharply between waves 1 and 2 and was approximately stable in later waves, and that the
increase deviates from changes in ownership rates as recorded in other U.S. surveys.

4. Our Hypothesis
We believe that the ownership rates of stocks and mutual funds, checking and savings
accounts, CDs, and bonds in AHEAD wave 1 were substantially underreported and that
the reason for this lies in the survey design. AHEAD wave 1 asks about income from
assets in several broad categories and records the answers as income from “stocks or
bonds/dividends” and “saving accounts/CDs/ interest.” See the Appendix for the exact
question wording and response codes. In a later section of the survey the ownership of
each specific asset is queried. This sequencing aspect and the wording of the ownership
questions are important. We believe that a number of respondents who reported income
from “stocks and bonds” in the income section fail to mention the ownership of stocks or
bonds or both later in the asset section because the ownership question begins with the
phrase “Aside from anything you have already told me about….” and then continues
“Do you own any stocks or mutual funds?” There are similar questions for ownership of
bonds, CDs, and checking and saving accounts. It seems likely that a number of
respondents thought that, because they had already told about income from stocks and
bonds, they should not now report ownership of these items when prompted with the

7

phrase “aside from anything you have already told me about.”7 Such an interpretation
could lead some respondents to report that they do not own any (additional) assets and
other respondents to report only on the subset of assets that were not income-producing.8
In what follows we present several pieces of evidence that support our hypothesis.

4.1. Relationship between Ownership Rates, Income Reporting and “Aside From”
Language
Table 7 categorizes assets according to whether income from the asset was queried in the
income section (which preceded the asset section in wave 1) and whether the query about
ownership used the language, “Aside from anything you have already told me about….”
For example, the income section asked about income from IRAs, and the “Aside from”
language was not used in the query about IRA values in the asset section. The shading
shows the four asset categories with the large increase in ownership rates, and the table
shows that with all four of those assets the “Aside from” language was used and that
income from the asset was queried.9 Thus, the large changes in ownership are confined
to the asset categories that used the “Aside from” language and that asked about income
from the asset prior to asset ownership and asset value. This would be expected
according to our hypothesis.

7

The phrase “Aside from anything you had already told me about…” was intentionally put in as a lead-in
to the question to avoid double counting of asset values. At the beginning of the asset section the
respondent had been queried about IRA ownership and value, so there was a risk that stocks held in IRAs
would be counted both as part of the value of the IRA and in response to the question about stock
ownership following immediately after the questions about IRAs.
8
AHEAD wave 1 asked only about the most important (other) sources of income received so that
households with only minor income from, say stocks and bonds, might not have reported it in the income
section.
9
As mentioned previously, the business asset question was changed after the 1993 wave to include farm
assets as well. Therefore, although there was a large increase in business ownership between 1993 and
1995, we do not shade this asset type because the increase can be attributed to this wording change.

8

4.2. Inconsistent Reports: Asset income reported, yet ownership denied
In AHEAD wave 1, 924 households reported income from stocks or bonds or both, yet
about 40% (359 households) denied ownership of both assets later in the asset section of
the survey. This is a clear inconsistency in the reports. Note that because AHEAD wave
1 records income from stocks and bonds jointly we can only identify a subset of the
inconsistencies: those who deny ownership of both assets while reporting income from
one or the other or both. The number of inconsistent cases (359 households) that we have
identified is therefore a lower bound for the underreporting of actual ownership.

4.3. Higher Transitions into Asset Ownership for Households who report Asset Income
in Wave 1
862 of the 924 households with income from stocks and bonds in wave 1 were reinterviewed in AHEAD wave 2. Because households tend to maintain ownership of
assets over a number of years, we would expect that owners in AHEAD wave 1 would
tend to be owners in wave 2. If reporting income from an asset is an indicator of
ownership, households that had income from an asset but did not report ownership,
should have high rates of ownership in wave 2 under our hypothesis. Table 8 offers
evidence that this is the case. It has transition rates from not owning in AHEAD wave 1
to owning in AHEAD wave 2 stratified by reporting of income from the asset in wave 1.
Thus, among those who had no income from stocks or bonds the transition rate to
ownership of either or both was 9.7 percent whereas among those who reported income
from stocks or bonds (but did not affirm ownership in wave 1) the transition rate was

9

81.3%. For reference, we show the transition rates from not owning to owning in HRS
waves 1 to 2 because we do not expect there to be the same classification error. As the
table shows the HRS transition rates are similar to the transition rates in AHEAD among
those who did not report income from the asset (and denied ownership), but the transition
rates are substantially higher in AHEAD among those who did report income (and denied
ownership).10 We find qualitatively the same results of unusually high transition rates
into ownership for CDs and for checking and savings accounts for households who
reported income from these assets but denied ownership (also shown in Table 8).

4.4. Comparison of Characteristics of Consistent and Inconsistent Reporters
Table 9 offers further evidence about the under-reporting of ownership in AHEAD
wave 1. It shows household and personal characteristics by report of income receipt and
ownership of stocks and bonds. We adopt a definition of “asset holding” that facilitates a
comparison with the reporting of income from “stocks and bonds” in AHEAD wave 1: we
consider a household “holding the asset” if it owns either stocks, or bonds, or both and “not
holding the asset” if it owns neither one of the two. Thus, in our classification in Table 9,
column (1) “no asset income, no asset” refers to those households that reported no income
from either source and denied ownership of both stocks and bonds; column (2) “household
owns asset” refers to households that affirmed holding stocks or bonds or both; Column (3)
“asset income reported, no asset” refers to households that reported income from stocks or
bonds or both but denied ownership of both.

10

Section N of the AHEAD wave 2 questionnaire asks about purchases and sales of assets between waves 1
and 2. We found these data to be sparse and uninformative possibly due to the skip patterns used in that
section.

10

As shown in column (1) 4,293 households report owning neither asset and in
column (2) 1,181 apparently owned one or both assets. The personal and household
characteristics of the two groups are very different. For example about 34% of the
nonowners are married whereas 55% of the owners are married. This is consistent with
marital status being a strong predictor of wealth. Just 17% of the owners have less
education than high school compared with 56% of the nonowners. Owners are much more
likely to own other assets: 85% own houses compared with 65% of nonowners, and asset
values in those other assets are considerably higher. Total wealth in wave 2 among owners
was $528 thousand compared with $107 thousand among non-owners. The subjective
probability of leaving a bequest has been shown to be strongly correlated with total wealth
(Smith, 1999). In the table the average probability of leaving a bequest of more than $100
thousand was 58.7% among owners and just 31.5% among nonowners.
Comparing the inconsistent reports in column(3), that is those who reported income
from the asset but denied ownership later, with the remaining households of AHEAD wave
1 in columns (1) and (2) shows that the inconsistent reporters have very similar
characteristics to owners in terms of education levels, ownership of housing, and total
wealth in wave 2. They have even greater total stock and bond wealth in wave 2 than
owners. This is plausible because column (3) only contains asset holders who reported
income from stocks and bonds as an “important source of income” which is an indicator for
more sizeable holdings; column (2) contains a mixture of asset holders with and without
important income receipts from the asset. The average probability of leaving a bequest of
more than $100 thousand is greater among inconsistent reporters, indicating that their true
wealth levels were probably greater in wave 1 even though their measured wealth levels
were considerably less (due to the lack of measured ownership of stocks and bonds).
11

4. Magnitude of the Problem and Potential for Correction
To gauge the importance of underreporting of ownership in wave 1 for the large gain
in total wealth in AHEAD between 1993 and 1995, we performed the following
calculation. We assumed that ownership rates of the four financial assets were the same
in 1993 as in 1995 and that the average amounts conditional on ownership were
accurately recorded in 1993. From these assumptions we calculated what population
wealth of each component would have been in 1993. Then we assumed that each
component changed value as it would have due to recorded capital gains between 1993
and 1995. For example, we assumed stock ownership was 30.8% in 1993 rather than the
recorded rate of 20.2% and that stock owners gained 32.4% between AHEAD wave 1 and
AHEAD wave 2.11 The result is that stocks and mutual funds held from 1993 to 1995
would have been worth $39.6 thousand in 1995. For the other three components of
financial wealth we assumed no change in price except for inflation because interest rates
were approximately constant over the two-year period. The overall result is that financial
wealth would have been worth $80.2 thousand in wave 2 of AHEAD. However, actual
wave 2 financial wealth was $117.0 thousand. We conclude from this exercise that the
underreporting of ownership was not by itself the only cause of the apparent undermeasurement of financial wealth in AHEAD wave 1.
The above calculation overlooks two other potential sources of underestimation
associated with the same design problem:

11

This is the gain in the New York Stock Exchange Index between February, 1994 and February, 1996.
Although wave 1 of AHEAD is said to occur in 1993, it actually was fielded in October, 1993. February
1994 was about the mid-point of the data collection.

12

First, average asset values of those households for whom ownership was
underreported due to the “aside from language” were likely higher than average. This is
because the income questions in wave 1 asked for “largest (other) income” and therefore
the survey design problem is more likely to occur for households with large asset
holdings. Table 9 lends support to this interpretation in that inconsistent reporters in
column (3) have substantially higher total wealth in wave 2 than the average asset holders
in column (2).
Second, suppose that just some stocks paid dividends and that income from those
stocks was reported in the income section. Then a respondent might have not reported
the value of that part of the portfolio when reporting ownership and the value of the other
part of the portfolio. Thus average stock holdings would have been underreported. We
recognize that this explanation is speculative and we do not have a good method for
investigating it.
As for corrections to the problem of underreporting, a number of difficulties have
to be recognized. Asset income in AHEAD wave 1 is not queried separately for each
asset. As a result we can only identify a subset of the observations where the misreports
occur. For example, we can clearly identify inconsistencies for those who reported a
source of income, say income from stocks and bonds, and who subsequently stated not
owning either one of these assets. However, it is possible that households that report
income from the combination of assets but own only one of the assets could also
misreport ownership. Observing only combinations of income also implies that
imputations of ownership will have to be performed jointly for the assets for which
income is observed jointly. This not only makes the imputation task more complex but
also will leads to less reliable imputations at the individual level.
13

One possible correction is to use observed asset ownership in AHEAD wave 2 and
ownership transitions between waves 2 and 3 to “backcast” asset ownership in wave 1.
However, asset ownership and asset ownership transitions between AHEAD waves 2 and
3 encompass approximately three years rather than the two years that separated waves 1
and 2. Moreover, observations between 1995 and 1998 will be affected by the very large
increase in the stock market during that period; that is, there are important time effects.
Alternatively, we might think of using observed asset ownership and ownership
transitions in HRS between wave 1 and wave 2 or between wave 2 and wave 3.
However, HRS covers a different cohort so that ownership rates and transitions observed
in those years cannot be transferred directly to the AHEAD cohort. Using observations
from the HRS when the sample is older does not help because age effects are very
important in stock ownership and values.
We conclude that strategies for imputations at the individual-level will be affected by
various sources of error. Depending on the use of the imputations, the trade-off among
these various sources of error may be different, and thus it is not possible to offer one
solution as being preferred.

5. Conclusions
We have offered what we believe to be good evidence of systematic underreporting
of financial asset ownership in AHEAD wave 1. The most likely explanation for the
underreporting is that avoiding one problem (double counting of the financial assets)
inadvertently caused another problem. The effect of this underreporting is that, at the
population level, wealth was measured to increase much more than is plausible. A lower
14

bound estimate of how much of the increase in wealth is accounted for by the survey
problem we identified is about $31 thousand or 46% of the difference. We believe that
the real impact is higher but it is difficult to provide a reliable estimate. From our
discussion of possible ways of fixing the identified problem by means of imputation at
the individual level, we conclude that the chances are slim of recovering the information
in a sufficiently reliable manner to allow the study of general behavioral questions.
Therefore, studies should consider the potential impact and potential solutions for this
problem on a case by case basis.

Appendix: Details on the AHEAD wave 1 Questionnaire
Order of Questionnaire Sections
In AHEAD wave 1 the income section, which also queries about income from financial
assets, is asked separately from the assets section and it is asked before the asset section.
In AHEAD wave 2 the income and the asset sections are integrated; income from
financial assets is only asked if the financial respondent states that the household holds
the asset.
Question wording of the income and asset questions in AHEAD wave 1 relevant to
this paper
1. Questions in AHEAD wave 1 that record income from financial assets
J19 The next questions are about regular sources of income.
IF R MARRIED or LIVING WITH PARTNER:

I will start by asking about income that you yourself receive. Later I will ask you
about income that your (husband/wife/partner) receives.
Do you yourself receive any (other) regular income payments; for example, from
retirement pensions, Veterans Benefits, annuities, payments from an IRA account, or
anything like that?
IF R DIVORCED/SEPARATED or WIDOWED or NEVER MARRIED:
Do you receive any (other) regular income payments; for example, from retirement
pensions, Veterans Benefits, annuities, payments from an IRA account, or anything
like that?

2. Excerpts from the Asset Section in AHEAD wave 1
For financial assets the AHEAD questionnaire first asks about IRAs and Keogh accounts
(K7):
K7 “Do you [or your (husband/wife/partner)] have any Individual Retirement
Accounts, that is, IRA or Keogh accounts?”
After a few IRA related questions the survey asks about stock ownership:
K10 (Aside from anything you have already told me about,) “Do you [or your
(husband/wife/partner)] have any shares of stock in publicly held corporations, or
mutual funds?”
The questions about ownership of other financial assets (checking and savings accounts;
CDs; and bonds) follow the same format as the one on stocks and mutual funds in K10.
