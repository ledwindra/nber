Birthing a Nation: The Effect of Fertility Control Access on the 19th Century Demographic
Transition

ABSTRACT
During the 19th century, the US birthrate fell by half. While previous economic literature has emphasized
demand-side explanations for this decline—that rising land prices and literacy caused a decrease in
demand for children—historians and others have emphasized changes in the supply of technologies
to control fertility, including abortion and birth control. In this paper I exploit the introduction during
the 19th century of state laws governing American women’s access to abortion to measure the effect
of changes in the supply of fertility technologies on the number of children born. I estimate an increase
in the birthrate of 4 to 12% when abortion is restricted, which lies within the ranges of estimates found
for the effect of fertility control supply restrictions on birthrates today. The importance of legal abortion in
reducing 19th-century birthrates helps to account for a previously unexplained portion of the demographic
transition. This paper posits that there has long been a demand, often unmet, for fertility control that
should be considered in future demographic research as well as in policy formulation.

Introduction
At the start of the 19th century, the US birthrate was among the highest in the
world. During the 1800s, however, the US experienced one of the world’s largest decline
in fertility. Total female fertility dropped from seven children per woman in 1800 to less
than four per woman at the end of the 19th century (Degler 1980). This drop is referred to
as the 19th Century Demographic Transition. Economic and demographic studies have
largely focused on the demand-side for fertility control during this transition. Why were
people demanding smaller families during this time period?
The demand hypotheses that have found the most support in the literature are the
land availability hypothesis (Degler 1980, Easterlin 1971, 1976a, 1976b, Forster and
Tucker 1972, Haines and Guest 2008, and Yasuba 1962) and the related bequest
hypothesis (Carter et al. 2004, Easterlin, Alter and Condran 1978, Haines 1987, Steckel
1992, Sundstrom and David 1988). There is a negative correlation between child-woman
ratios and population density at the state level (Yasuba 1962) and the county level
(Forster and Tucker 1972). Easterlin presents a sociological hypothesis that the reason
for this correlation is that parents, wanting to divide their property equally between their
heirs, would rather keep their children close than send them West where land was
cheaper, and thus have fewer children (Easterlin 1976a). Haines and Hacker (2006)
argue that parents wanted this proximity as a form of old-age insurance. However, this is
more of a motivation for parents to keep the most productive children nearby than to keep
all of them. In addition, in the tradition of primogeniture that British settlers brought to
the early United States, there was no need to divide up land among heirs (Easterlin

3

1976b). Nonetheless, Steckel (1992) finds that the strongest predictive variables for
fertility were financial institutions and labor market structures, and Carter et al. (2004)
and Sundstrom and David (1988) suggest that the land-availability hypothesis does
poorly in the South is because slaves provided a version of old-age insurance. Carter et
al (2004) presents and excellent analysis of these literatures.
There is also some support in the literature for the increased education hypothesis
(Degler 1980, Easterlin 1976b, McLaren 1990, Reed 1978). Easterlin (1976b) finds a
small negative correlation between literacy of parents and fertility rates among farm
families, although Carter et al. (2004) find mixed results of literacy and education on
fertility. McLaren (1990) and Degler (1980) report that literate wives had lower fertility
than did illiterate wives married to men of the same class. Education may change
attitudes towards fertility and raise the cost of children by increasing women’s income
potential. A similar hypothesis is the “outside opportunities for women” hypothesis. In
this hypothesis, women are attracted to paid employment at the expense of childbearing.
However, differences in fertility rates are found even between more and less densely
populated rural areas in the 19th century, where education and literacy levels were high
for all women and there were very few employment opportunities outside of the “farmwife” role. Therefore these hypotheses cannot entirely explain the decrease in fertility
rates (Easterlin 1976a).
Other hypotheses that have not found as much support include the child labor
hypothesis and the burden of aged dependents hypothesis. As the US industrialized,
child labor was less useful than it had been in an agricultural economy (Gordon 1976).
Again, examining fertility differences among agricultural areas finds that fertility was

4

actually higher in areas where child labor was less useful (Easterlin 1976a). Therefore
this hypothesis cannot explain the entire decline. Similarly, little evidence has been
found to support the idea that families in newer areas were less likely to be supporting
aging relatives.

Perhaps the most convincing argument against this explanation is

Easterlin’s (1976a) assertion that there were not enough aged persons relative to primeaged working adults to account for any differences in fertility.
Early economics theories also touched on fertility control as a side-effect of
delayed marriage or increased breast-feeding (Degler 1980, Reed 1978, Sanderson 1979,
Wahl 1986). Although these methods may have been in part responsible for some of the
earlier, 18th-century, demographic transition, especially in France, they cannot explain all
of the increase in child spacing or the termination of childbearing within marriage before
a woman’s fertile years had ended.

Easterlin (1976b) provides a summary of the

evidence that marital fertility limitation was more important than delayed marriage in the
19th-century U.S. demographic transition (c.f. Degler 1980, Reed 1978). These and other
hypotheses are discussed in greater detail by Easterlin (1976a, 1976b), and Haines and
Hacker (2006). Similarly, urbanization and industrialization have been cited as sources
of lower fertility, but the drop precedes the greater part of these phenomena, and the drop
in the rural birth rate matched that of the urban birth rate (Degler 1980, Reed 1978).
Outside of the field of economics, the supply side of fertility control technology
has been explored more thoroughly. Historians, using letters and other print evidence,
have pointed out that there has always been a demand for fertility control (Degler 1980,
Mohr 1978), but the 19th century provided information and access to abortion and birth
control through word of mouth, print literature, lecture tours, and the new catalogue

5

market (Brodie 1994, Mohr 1978, Scott Smith 1973, Smith-Rosenberg 1985, van de
Walle and de Luca 2006). Put in economics terms, transaction costs for fertility control
access had decreased with improved information transfer, product markets, and decreased
transportation costs.
Why has this supply-side view been substantially ignored by economists?2 Some
argue that there were no birth control or abortion inventions in the 19th century (Degler
1980). Indeed, much of the birth control and abortion technology had been invented in
Roman times or earlier. The only major fertility control invention in the 19th century was
the 1844 vulcanization of rubber, which greatly improved the quality of condoms and
decreased prices. However, just because the technology had been invented does not
mean that it was available to the average American. Innovation and information transfer
played an important role in 19th century fertility, as they did in many spheres during the
second industrial revolution. A parallel can be made to the steam engine, invented during
the time of Archimedes, but not used for practical purposes until the 18th century, and
having its largest effect on the economy when applied to railroads with increasing
refinements in the 19th century.3
A second reason for this lack of interest in supply-side causes of the demographic
transition is that only recently have economists taken an interest in the effects of birth
control and abortion access on major economic outcomes (cf. Angrist and Evans 2001,
Bailey 2006, Donohue and Levitt 2012, Goldin and Katz 2002, Levine 2004, and others).
2

But not all economists—David and Sanderson (1986) specifically address the supply-side of 19th century
family limitation and its “quiet percolation” throughout the 19 th century. Haines (1986) and Haines and
Guest (2008) also mention the need for more research on information diffusion about the means to control
fertility.
3
There is some disagreement among economic historians as to the validity of this analogy. It is true that
many technological advances needed to be made before Archimedes steam engine could be harnessed for
practical use.

6

Haines (1986) also argues that the availability of 19th century data may also have limited
previous activity in this area.
Information transfer and innovation can help explain the correlations that have
been found between fertility rates and land prices (which are directly related to
population density), between fertility rates and railroadization (Carter et al. 2004 and the
author’s calculations), and between fertility rates and literacy rates. Higher population
density means that women can communicate different birth control techniques to each
other, and that there is a market to support midwife and abortion services. Places with a
large enough population center might also be included on the lecture circuit, which grew
dramatically over this period (Degler 1980). Population density is also tied to canals and
railroadization, which facilitated the circulation of paper information in the form of
newspapers, advertisements, mail-order services, pamphlets, and books.4 Higher literacy
rates allow people to digest the flow of information.
This paper focuses on the effects of limiting availability to fertility-control
information, products, and services, specifically those of abortion. It finds that fertility
rates are higher in states and times when access to this technology has been cut off by
state laws restricting abortion. When the costs of obtaining fertility control are higher,
people will not limit their fertility as easily as when costs are lower, even when demand
for fertility control does not change. Therefore, the fertility ratio will be higher in areas
where access to products and information has been cut off by legislative action. This
paper’s estimates that abortion restrictions led to an 4-12% increase in births are

strikingly similar to results on the effects of limited abortion access for modern
populations (cf. Levine et al. 1999, Angrist and Evans 1999).
The value added to recent discussions of fertility control by the approach of
examining the 19th century is twofold. First, identification of effects is easier—fertility
has been completed, so regressions do not need to censor for potential future children.
Second, laws changed over a long period of time rather than providing, as in the case of
1970s abortion legalization, just a few years of differences between states (in addition,
higher travel costs make contamination between states less of an issue). In a companion
paper (Ananat and Lahey, mimeo), the long period since these law changes means that
full lifecycle effects on the cohorts of children born to women who had more versus less
fertility control can be observed. These effects include not only education, marriage, and
childbearing, but even longevity and mortality.

Background
Nineteenth-century women seeking to abort often used herbal remedies before
resorting to surgical ones. Some of these herbs, such as cotton root, black or blue cohosh,
rue, or savin, were potentially effective abortifacients, and some herbs made women ill
enough that their bodies aborted on their own (see, for example, Ernst 2002, Madari and
Jacobs 2004). Other herbal remedies were not actually abortifacients, but emenogogues
that did help regulate menstrual cycles and so gave the appearance of being effective
abortifacients. Others were purgatives, causing illness and intestinal problems, or were
harmless but useless. These remedies were widely advertised and available through mail

8

order until changes in the legal environment in the latter part of the 19th century made
them more difficult to obtain (Brodie 1994, King 1992, Smith-Rosenberg 1985).
As in the early to mid 20th century, membrane rupture through the use of metal
rods (knitting needles and crochet hooks are reported to have been popular) or sharp
sticks was a common surgical method of abortion used by “irregular” abortionists and
women themselves. Once the membrane was ruptured, the body would expel the fetus on
its own. This method was very dangerous and could easily injure the woman’s internal
organs if performed incorrectly (King 1992).
Dilation and cutterage, though invented in ancient Greece, was only reintroduced
to the Western world in the 1840s; it became prominent among regular physicians
sometime in the 1860s or 1870s (King 1992). This method first dilates the cervix, then
uses surgical tools to scrape fetal tissue out of the uterus. It is still common today, but
must be performed with the appropriate tools. Although thought to be safer and more
effective than membrane rupture when performed by a trained professional, it can still
lead to infection.
It is not known whether abortion or childbirth was the more dangerous option
during the 19th century (King 1992).5 Observers from that time period have made the
claim in either direction depending on their agenda (King 1992), and scattered statistics
also point in either direction (Degler 1980, Gordon 1976, Mohr 1978, Tribe 1990). The
relative danger may have varied over the time period, as both childbirth technology and

5

Initial examination of death records provided by Fogel and by Ferrie suggests that reported deaths from
childbirth were several times larger than those from abortion and miscarriage during this time. When
including child bed deaths (a form of sepsis), this fraction is even larger. It should be noted that death by
“abortion” in these early death certificates may mean the same as death by miscarriage (personal
communication Noelle Yetter). However, it is not clear that all deaths from botched abortions would be
coded as such.

abortion technology were changing throughout the century. Increases in hospital birthing
have been shown to have increased maternal mortality in Europe in the 19th century and
the United States in the early 20th century (maternal mortality statistics are not available
for the US before the 20th century) because hospitals introduced more germs than did
home births (Loudon 1993). Hospital births did not really become “safe” until the 1940s
with the invention of sulpha drugs (McLaren 1990, Thomasson and Treber 2008). The
germ theory of disease and the spread of dilation and cutterage may have made surgical
abortions safer, if performed by trained professionals with the appropriate tools.
However, the legal environment that this paper exploits made these safer abortions
difficult to obtain in the second half of the 19th century.
Doctors began to notice an increase in abortions in the late 1830s and 1840s
(Degler 1980, McLaren 1990). The most famous abortionist, New York City’s Madame
Restell, began her practice in 1838. Abortions early in the century were generally sought
by poor, unmarried women. The increase in professional abortions, however, drew from
the married middle-class (Degler 1980, Mohr 1978, Reagan 1991).

Two thirds of

abortion cases cited in the medical journals in the second half of the 19th century were of
married women (Mohr 1978). Mohr (1978) and Scott Smith (1971) separately estimated
that there was one abortion for every 25-30 live births in the early 19th century, but one
abortion for every 5-6 live births in the mid to late 19th century.6 Some authors estimate
as many as one abortion for every 4 live births (McFarlane and Meier 2001, McLaren
1990, Tribe 1990). A study by the 1891 Michigan Board of Health cited one abortion for
6

David and Sanderson (1986) argue that the 1 in 5 number was caused by a typographical error in the
original source material and should actually be 1 in 50, a number they estimate as much too small because
the rate of natural miscarriage is 1 in 5. However, the rate of natural miscarriage that they obtain is from a
1979 source, after the advent of home pregnancy tests, and thus overestimates the number of miscarriages
likely to be known in the 19th century.

10

every 3 pregnancies, 70-80% of which were obtained by middle and upper class women,
and a 6 percent mortality rate (Gordon 1976, Smith-Rosenberg 1985). Gordon (1976)
suggests that earlier estimates of the number of abortions were understated and the death
rates overstated because successful abortions were undercounted by contemporaries. On
the other hand, David and Sanderson (1986) argue that these numbers are overestimates
because they underestimate the natural rate of miscarriage. However, Sanderson (1979)
suggests that somewhat under half of all births averted by ever married women were
averted through induced abortion rather than birth control.
The 19th century U.S. saw many major changes besides declining fertility rates.
Transaction costs were decreasing—in modern parlance, the world was getting “flatter.”
The United States was undergoing an early information revolution: as railroads spread
across the country, mass production and distribution became a reality, and the growth of
printing presses, combined with faster transportation and mass literacy, allowed for more
information transfer (Smith-Rosenberg 1985). The Second Industrial Revolution brought
significant changes in economic organization and modes of production.

All these

changes, however, were gradual, in contrast to the sharp changes that occurred within
states when abortion restrictions were enacted.
History of abortion laws
Early abortion laws, beginning in the 1830s and 1840s, were some of the first
instances of malpractice laws. They regulated who could legally give abortions and
punished unlawful abortionists, especially if the woman died, but they did not punish
women seeking abortions (Brodie 1994).

Traditionally under British common law,

abortions before “quickening,” when the woman could feel movement, were not

11

considered immoral both because the fetus was generally not thought to be alive at that
point and because proving pregnancy before quickening was difficult (Degler 1980,
Gordon 1976, King 1992). During this time period, many state supreme courts ruled that
abortion before quickening was not a criminal offense (Brodie 1994). Moreover, many
of the early state abortion laws were the result of automatic criminal code revisions and
were not well publicized (Brodie 1994).

Many others were parts of omnibus laws

protecting consumers from dangerous poisons or protecting women in general (Degler
1980, Lader 1966, Mohr 1978, Polsky 1970).
In 1860s through 1880s, however, states began to pass more restrictive antiabortion laws that outlawed advertisements, closed loopholes, and made women liable for
seeking an abortion. Many of these laws also prohibited abortions before “quickening.”
Unlike previous laws, these laws specifically focused on preventing abortion and were
not part of omnibus law changes as the earlier laws had been (Degler 1980). Although
the courts were often sympathetic to women and abortionists, the publicity and
questioning during a trial could permanently tarnish a reputation and in many cases the
official investigations and court trials amounted to harassment (Reagan 1991).7
Social Movements Towards Restriction
There are many theories as to why the more restrictive abortion laws were passed
after the 1860s. The American Medical Association (AMA) was the leading force behind
anti-abortion legislation. The leading theory on the subject, put forth by Mohr (1978) and

7

Anne McCants (personal communication) suggests that even if anti-abortion laws did not directly affect
ability to procure an abortion (for example, if purported abortifacents do not actually work, or women and
abortionists do not actually fear the laws) they could still increase fertility if men believe that any attempts
to restrict fertility in an environment where such attempts are illegal. In this case, husbands may worry that
having fewer children would be indicative of lower masculinity and would thus increase their reproductive
efforts in order to prevent gaining a negative reputation.

12

taken up by many others (Brodie 1994, King 1992), is that the fledgling AMA used
abortion as a focal point in its fight to distinguish its doctors from quacks and other
“irregulars.” One argument made by some historians is that the AMA had originally tried
to use prostitution regulation as their core issue but that effort had failed dramatically and
lent strength to their opponents. Abortion better served their purpose (Reed 1978). A
similar but less Machiavellian explanation for the actions of the AMA is that regular
doctors believed that the Hippocratic oath disallowed abortions and did not want others
practicing abortions (and, in addition, possibly stealing patients) if they could not (Mohr
1978). Another, less mainstream, theory of AMA involvement suggests that through
advancing medical technology of the time, doctors had a better understanding of
conception and gestation and viewed fetal growth as a continuous process, rather than
one in which life was infused at “quickening,” or when the mother could first feel
movement (generally around 18-20 weeks) (Degler 1980). Reed (1978) suggests that
physicians saw each abortion as a lost potential paying customer, especially as well-off
middle class women began to be the primary recipients of abortions.
Some feminist historians emphasize that the leaders in both the anti-abortion and
anti-birth control movements, such as Storer and Comstock, were themselves infertile.
Recent modern evidence that legislators who are also fathers are more likely to favor
abortion rights if they have daughters (Washington 2008) lends plausibility to the
argument that 19th-century views on abortion were affected by such personal
characteristics—that “the personal is political.” A final argument is that since white,
middle class women were practicing family limitation in greater numbers, middle class

13

white men (which included the members of the AMA) were worried about immigrants
and other undesirables populating the country (Smith-Rosenberg 1985).
Data
Abortion Laws
A number of secondary sources exist describing abortion laws. Contemporary
activists from both sides of the abortion debate provided snapshots of the laws as they
existed at the time (Dennett 1926, Storer 1859, 1868). Additionally, historians have
compiled lists of these laws for various time periods, and legal scholars have discussed
specific laws in depth (Dellapena 2006, Lader 1966, Mohr 1978, Quay 1961). To
identify all state laws regulating abortion, I compiled and compared these secondary
sources.

The original laws were also obtained from the Harvard Law Library’s

microfiche of superceded state statutes and the UCLA law library superceded state
statutes. Additional laws were obtained via Google books and state law librarians.
In addition to the existence of the law, various characteristics of these laws were
coded.

These include laws regarding: obscene supplies (“articles or instruments of

immoral use,” such as devices, appliances, apparatuses, drugs); obscene information (any
material containing obscene language or images, including information on how to obtain
supplies); and laws specifically outlawing information or actions related to “procuring a
miscarriage” (abortion). For each law, it is noted how what share of possible activities it
restricted: importing; sale; advertisement; distribution (including circulating or printing
information); verbal communication (including “uttering” or giving oral information);
using the postal service; possession; possession with intent to sell or distribute; or
singing. Each law’s severity was also recorded: whether the offense was classified as a

14

misdemeanor or a felony (or left unclassified), as well as the punishment, if specified.
Exemptions include coding for each law whether it contained a clause indicating that it
did not apply to the following: scientific or medical works or books; medical colleges;
practitioners of medicine (which could refer to physicians, nurses, druggists, midwives,
etc.); artists and works of art; or activities for saving the life of the mother.
Fertility rates
Fertility behavior is observed at the level of state and decade. Ideally, to test the
effect of the introduction of laws on childbearing behavior, there would be individual
birth cohort data by year, i.e., the number of children born in each state in 1850, in 1851,
etc. Cohort size could then be predicted using an indicator for whether there was a law in
place in that state in the year before that cohort was born, when abortion policy would
have been relevant for that cohort. Ideally there would also be information on individual
characteristics of women linked with childbearing, in order to test hypotheses such as
those in the literature on recent fertility control legal innovations that access affected the
behavior of groups (such as teens, or poor women) that had relatively high demand for
fertility control differently from other women.
Unfortunately, Census information on single years of birth is not available for the
full sample—the Census tables only provide population data by five-year age groups (04, 5-9, etc).

Moreover, historical Census tables do not provide information on

childbearing linked to mothers. Instead, the standard measure of 19th century fertility is
the child:woman ratio, calculated as the ratio of the number of children aged 0-9 to the
number of women of childbearing age, or 15-44 (some authors use ages 20-44 or 20-49).
Child:woman ratios were calculated by state-decade from 1800-1910 using tabulated

15

census data from Haines Census tables in the Historical Statistics of the United States
(Carter et al. 2006), which is Census data cleaned by Haines (many earlier studies used a
version of the data presented by Kuznets). For the 1880 census, I replaced the Haines
data with collapsed cells from the IPUMs 100% sample.8 The sample contains white
women aged 15-44 (using the Yasuba interpolation for 40-44 year olds from data for 3039, 40-49 and 50-59 year olds9)—see Figure 1. This measure captures fertility rate and
spacing between children; it is also highly correlated with total fertility (Haines and
Hacker 2006).

More thorough discussions of the benefits and limitations of these

measures can be found in Easterlin (1976a), Haines and Hacker (2006) and Yasuba
(1966).10

Methodology
To examine the impact of abortion restrictions on the number of children born, I
exploit the quasi-experiment provided by the variation across states in the timing of
passage of laws prohibiting abortion (shown in Figure 2).11 Analysis is limited to 1850
and later for several reasons. First, many states did not exist before 1850 and did not
have state law books. Second, as discussed above, there is reason to believe that there are
actually two phenomena occurring in the 19th century: an increase of technology and
information transfer in the first half of the century, and a legal brake on this flow in the

8

Approximately half of the cells do not differ between the two datasets, most of those that do differ at the
100s place, several differ at the 1000s place, and three cells (Arkansas women age 10-14, Indiana women
age 15-19, and Missouri women age 20-24) differ at the 10000s place. The results are very similar using
the 1880 Haines census tables (generally changes only occur at the third decimal place on coefficients if at
all).
9
The interpolation formula is (A+8B-C)/16, where A is the 30-39 cohort, B is 40-49, and C is 50-59.
10
IPUMs cell sizes for 1850-1870 are too small to be representative of the population needed.

States in the chart that are not included in the regressions (because of late state-hood and/or lack of
population data) are: Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Utah.

second half. Whereas early abortion laws tended to focus on malpractice and may have
actually made abortions safer for the women seeking them, later laws made abortions
more dangerous and difficult to obtain. States that did not exist before 1890 were also
excluded. (Most of the states gaining statehood between 1850 and 1890 had law and
population information collected while territories).

The Dakotas are also excluded

because population information is not collected for the separate states in the early
decades.12
Because only the entire number of children born over the ten years prior to each
Census (i.e., those aged 0 to 9) is observable, the relationship between a law passed in a
given year and the number of children born the next year cannot be identified. To
capture the fact that a law passed between Censuses affected only those pregnancies that
began afterward, a measure of for how much of a decade there was a valid law in place is
defined. This measure captures the share of the decade for which the law was relevant to
childbearing. This variable is lagged one year, because abortions in year 0 cause a
change in births in year 1.
For a law to be relevant to the cohorts of children aged 0 to 9 in 1880, the law
must have been passed in the period 1870-1879. A law passed in 1876 was relevant to
those children born in 1877, 1878, and 1879—that is, it was relevant for roughly 30% of
the children who were aged 0 to 9 in 1880. Therefore such a law is coded as 0.3 for the
decade ending in 1880. A law passed in 1870 or earlier was coded with an indicator
value of 1.0 for the decade ending in 1880. If a state did not have a law for any of the

12

Population information is available for West Virginia, and I double checked the state ratio in Carter et al.
(2006) with county-level data. WV laws are coded as the same as those in VA prior to the split until WV
updated its law sometime after the split.

17

period 1870-1879, the indicator has a value of 0 for the decade ending in 1880. Details
of the laws, such as restrictions, were coded by decade in a similar fashion.
The empirical specification is as follows:
(1)

Fds = β1 havelawds + δd + δs + d*δs + eds

where Fds represents alternative measures of ten-year fertility in decade d in state s, and
havelawds is a continuous indicator variable ranging in value from 0 to 1 that reflects the
share of the decade for which a state has a law restricting abortion. State-specific (δs) and
decade-specific (δd) fixed effects are included to capture longstanding differences in
fertility patterns across states over time as well as aggregate patterns of changing fertility
preferences over time. In some specifications I also allow the state-specific differences to
trend over time by including an interaction between δs and decade d.

In some

specifications, I include d2*δs, the square of the state-specific time trend. The main
specification is unweighted to study the effect of the experiment, other specification
checks were weighted by total population to provide information for back of the envelope
calculations on the overall effect of the changes or women age 15-44 as a specification
check. The coefficient β1 measures the difference in ten-year fertility between states for
which a law was in effect for the entire decade (havelawds =1) and states for which a law
was never in effect in that decade (havelawds =0). In some specifications Fds is measured
as the level of the child:woman ratio, and in others as the log of that ratio. When using
the ratio itself, β1 represents an estimate of the change in the number of children born per
woman; when using the logged ratio, β1 represents the percent change in childbearing.

Results

18

The results of OLS estimates of equation (1) are shown in Table 1, Panel I. Log
and level regressions give similar results. Estimates suggest that laws restricting abortion
led to an increase of between 106 and 137 children born over a decade per 1000 women,
or a 9% to 12% increase in the number of children per woman from a base of about 1100
on average. These results are statistically significant at conventional levels in most
specifications, depending on decisions about weighting. The preferred specification is
that in column (4), with a full set of state and year fixed effects and state trends,
suggesting a 12% increase. Including state-specific time trends generally increases the
estimated strength and significance of the relationship between legal restrictions and birth
rates, suggesting that it is important to include controls for secular trends.
The second panel of Table 1 estimates the overall affect of these laws on the
population of the United States. Unlike Panel I, which tests the effect of the natural
experiment, Panel II includes weights by total population, giving more power to the
actions of larger states. The point estimates for these results are somewhat smaller and
less significant, particularly when state trends are included in the estimation. These
results suggest that the laws increased the national child/woman ratio by 4 to 12%.
Table 2 tests the different aspects of these laws that may have strengthened or
weakened the effects of the laws. The effect of a medical exemption signed as expected
and not significant, however it increases the effect of having an abortion law on fertility
to an increase of 15%. This variable indicates that an abortion is legal if there is a
therapeutic exception to save the life of the mother or child or that physicians and
medical texts are exempt from the law. Controlling for laws that allow for a crime to be
committed only if the fetus dies also strengthens the impact of the have law variable to

19

13%. With this exception, a woman can seek an abortion or a practitioner can perform
one without being prosecuted. Since early abortions with abortifacients are difficult to
detect as abortions, the law essentially allows early abortions prior to quickening as had
been allowed by common law. Holding the female at fault increases fertility, but not
significantly so and controlling for female fault does not affect the effect of having a law.
However, this results should be interpreted with caution as only a few laws deem the
female at fault. Prohibiting sale, ads, and mailing of abortion information does not seem
to affect fertility beyond the effect of the original law.13 Classifying abortion as a felony
seems to have no impact on the law; this lack could be because judges and juries were
generally sympathetic to abortion cases in terms of finding fault and sentencing, but the
true penalty for those accused came from the publicity associated with the trial (Reagan
1991).14
One controversy in the literature is on the effects of the legality of abortion prior
to quickening. Mohr (1978) holds that the change in legality of abortions prior to
quickening is important and makes the laws more restrictive. Later and openly pro-life
scholars (e.g. Dellapenna 2006, Olansky 1995) disagree, arguing that abortion before
quickening was always prohibited. King (1992), in contrast to either faction, takes a
more pragmatic view and argues that physicians could not determine pregnancy prior to
quickening. Columns (7) and (8) in Table 2 examine the effect of laws restricting
abortion prior to quickening and find no effect of these law characteristics. This null
13

Disallowing any information about abortions has similar results. It may be that the availability of
effective early abortifacents was limited and that the majority of the action of these laws is occurring with
later term abortions. However, I do not want to put too much weight on this conclusion.
14
Coefficients are remarkably similar when all characteristics are included in the same regression; the
effect of having a law increases to 16% with all characteristics included. Other law characteristics
discussed in the literature but not presented here include poison and instrument prohibitions. These do not
seem to have much of an impact, probably because the majority of laws include poison and instrument
prohibitions so there is not much variation in these restrictions.

20

result suggests that how quickening was treated was not that important in the 19th
century.
Another Mohr hypothesis that can be examined is the relationship between AMA
strength and passage of anti-abortion legislation. Figure 3a provides a scatter-plot with
the date of a physician licensing law (Marks 2009) on the X-axis and year of first antiabortion law on the Y-axis. The thought would be that an upward slope would indicate a
positive relationship between physician political power and passage of anti-abortion laws.
There appears to be no such effect. Figure 3b uses a different measure of physician
power, the year that the first medical school was passed (US Bureau of Education
1898).15 Here there is an upward trend suggesting that the relationship is worth looking
into. Table 3 shows the standard regression including whether or not a state has a
physician licensing law in columns (1) and (2) or a medical school in columns (3) and
(4). The lack of effect of physician licensing law is borne out in the first two columns.
Column (3) suggests that having a medical school may impact the effect of an antiabortion law, however, that effect goes away once state specific time trends are
controlled for as in column (4). Thus physician strength does not seem to be related to
passage of anti-abortion legislation. However, the measures of physician strength are
crude and better measures may find an effect.

15

Year medical school was passed includes regular and eclectic schools and does not include homeopathic
and postgraduate. Dates of first medical school after 1898 were taken from later editions of The Report of
the Commissioner of Education Made to the Secretary of Education and from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_the_United_States , confirmed on each medical
school’s webpage as the earliest. Later editions of The Report of the Commissioner of Education have
different definitions of what is counted as a medical school, but we use the 1898 definition for all schools
prior to 1898. The results are very similar using different definitions.

21

Laws restricting abortion are positively correlated (correlation is .47) with those
restricting birth control.16 Putting the two types of fertility restriction laws together as in
Table 4, controlling for birth control laws does not seem to change the effect of having an
abortion law. Different methods of measuring birth control laws also do not seem to
affect the effect of an abortion law.
If, rather than childbearing patterns changing in reaction to laws, in fact the
passage of laws reflected legislative reaction to changes in childbearing, then these
estimates could not be interpreted as the effects of changes in access to fertility control.
The falsification check shown in Table 5 tests for this possibility; I attempt to predict the
passage of a law in the next decade using the child to woman ratio in the current decade.
These tests find no consistent or statistically significant relationship between fertility and
subsequent passage of a law in any specification, as shown in column (1). There is also
no evidence for an effect of the percent immigrant, the female-male ratio, or the percent
of the population lost in the Civil War on the probability that a law was passed in the next
decade, as demonstrated in columns (2)-(4) respectively.17
Another worry is that these laws prohibiting abortion are merely symptomatic of
changes in social mores that themselves affect fertility. Therefore I collected information
on legislation that prevented obscene singing, something that should be correlated with
social mores, but presumably would not affect fertility directly. I also used data from
(Eskridge 2009) on state laws banning public indecency and public exhibition which

16

I collected laws restricting birth control from primary sources and compared them to those collected by
Bailey (2010). However, the passage of these laws is predicted by previous fertility rates and thus the laws
do not exogenously predict current fertility.
17
Pretending the law was introduced 10 or 20 years earlier in results available from the author also
decreases the magnitude and significance of the coefficient (eventually flipping the sign), further
suggesting that the laws are not endogenous to fertility.

22

should be similarly correlated with social mores but should not directly affect fertility. 18
Table 6 shows that all of these laws have a negative rather than a positive effect on
ln(fertility) in specifications without a state-specific time trend included. Indecency laws
are significant at the 5% level in column (1) but this significance disappears and the sign
flips once a state specific time trend is accounted for. Exhibition laws show a similar
sign flip from column (3) to (4). Obscene singing laws remain negative and insignificant
in both column (5) and (6).
Finally, Table 7 provides additional specification checks. The magnitudes of the
coefficient of havelaw are smaller when weighted by the number of women age 15-44 as
in column (1). Percent black in a state does not affect the coefficient of havelaw in
column (2). Although a south dummy is positive and significant, it does not change the
coefficient of havelaw once state dummies and state trends are also controlled for as in
column (3). Clustering by state, column (4), or by state*year, column (5), does not affect
the results. Results are also nearly identical when fertility is measured with children age
0-9/ women age 20-44 or when measured with children age 0-4/women age 15-44 as in
columns (6) and (7). The coefficient is somewhat larger when the sample is limited to
1860-1910 rather than 1850-1910, despite the larger sample size, as in column (8).

Discussion and Conclusion
These estimates are highly consistent with research on recent (1970s-era) changes
in legal access to abortion and birth control, which find effects from 5% for the overall
population to 15% for groups that are particularly likely to want to decrease childbearing

18

Eskridge (2009) also included laws on indecent liberties, enticement, contributing to sexual delinquency,
and schoolyard loitering but these laws tended to be passed later than anti-abortion laws.

23

(e.g. poor women, teenagers) (Ananat and Hungerman 2006, Levine et al. 1999).

The

consistency of the birthrate response to restrictions on fertility control is remarkable
particularly because of the lower efficacy and higher risks associated with 19th-century
methods of abortion. These results suggest that demand for increased fertility control has
been persistent since the 19th century, rather than being a recent social development
driven merely by shifting gender roles or increased labor market opportunities.

How

much lower would fertility have been in the absence of these laws? A back of the
envelope calculation, shown in Table 8, suggests that in the absence of abortion laws,
fertility would have been 5.23% lower without abortion laws in 1900 and 5.72% lower in
1910 and 13.81% lower in 1920.
The flow and eventual cutting off of information and product availability for
fertility control did have real effects on fertility rates in the 19th century United States.
Using laws restricting abortion as a source of variation in availability, reducing the
availability of abortion increased fertility rates in the 19th century. These estimates of the
effects of abortion access are similar to those found in more recent times, and suggest that
when studying the 19th century U.S. demographic transition, explanations based on
supply factors cannot be neglected relative to those based on demand.

Note: Robust standard errors are in parentheses. Regressions report the results from equation 2, the
probability that a state got a law in the following decade. Regressions with civil war independent
variables also include an indicator for missing Civil War information. Years included are 1850-1910
and states include all states extant before 1890 excluding the Dakotas for which population information
is available. Regressions include state fixed effects, year fixed effects, and linear state trends. There
are 291 observations.
