    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop an empirical Bayes ranking procedure that assigns ordinal grades to noisy measurements, balancing the information content of the assigned grades against the expected frequency of ranking errors. Applying the method to a massive correspondence experiment, we grade the race and gender contact gaps of 97 U.S. employers, the identities of which we disclose for the first time. The grades are presented alongside measures of uncertainty about each firm\u2019s contact gap in an accessible report card that is easily adaptable to other settings where ranks and levels are of simultaneous interest.\n\n",
