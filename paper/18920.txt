ABSTRACT
We revisit the relationship between foreign investment and productivity of acquired firms. First,
we construct a panel firm-level dataset for eight advanced European countries covering domestic
and foreign acquisitions together with detailed balance sheet information for the years
1999{2012. Second, we address the challenge of identifying a causal relation. To that end, we
compare foreign to domestic acquisitions in addition to accounting for the impact of majority
versus minority acquisitions after controlling for country and sector trends. The productivity of
foreign acquired affiliates increases modestly after four years, but only when majority stakes are
acquired by foreigners. Our results are driven by foreign acquisitions and not by foreign
divestment.

Introduction

The stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) inward positions in the OECD was a
staggering 21.7 trillion dollars in 2017—a magnitude that makes the policy relevance
of any potential impact self-evident.1 FDI typically takes the form of take-overs of
existing firms (Barba-Navaretti and Venables (2004)) and FDI is likely to increase the
productivity of acquired firms because foreign owners may bring superior technical,
marketing, and/or management skills to the acquired firm. Firms are heterogeneous
and multinational firms that invest abroad are more productive than purely domestic firms (see Blonigen, Fontagne, Sly, and Toubal (2014)).2 It is therefore likely
that a domestic firm which is acquired by a foreign (likely high-productivity) firm
will see an increase in productivity since technological knowledge (Aitken and Harrison (1999)) or good management practices (Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2012))
can be transferred to subsidiaries. Guadalupe, Kuzmina, and Thomas (2012), for
example, show that foreign majority investors in Spain employ new equipment and
production processes leading to higher productivity of acquired firms.
We revisit the question of whether investment by foreign firms leads to higher
productivity growth of acquired firms in advanced economies. The existing results
from the literature on the magnitude of productivity gains from FDI vary widely
from nil to a high of 16% across studies conducted for different developed countries.
Considering the wide range of estimates for single countries, there is a need for a crosscountry study to provide estimates of the typical effect in advanced economies. We
measure productivity as revenue total factor productivity, which we refer to simply
as “productivity,” although, at places, we also consider labor productivity, which we
will refer to as such.
We make several contributions. Our first contribution is the construction of a
large-scale multi-country firm-level panel dataset using the Orbis database, available
1

OECD International Direct Investment Statistics 2018.
Even in the advanced economy of the United States, foreign owned firms are more productive
than domestic firms as shown by Doms and Jensen (1998) and Helpman, Melitz, and Yeaple (2004).
These authors argue that the fixed cost of setting up foreign operations explains why only the most
productive firms in an economy engage in foreign investment.

from Bureau van Dijk (BvD)-Moody’s. Orbis is the only harmonized multi-country
dataset that has accounting data and ownership information, needed for studying
FDI, with near-universal coverage of registered firms of all sizes, with the distribution
of firms by size and industry resembling the official data.3 In order to obtain a dataset
which allows for estimation without survivorship bias, we put together a longitudinal
firm-level dataset from annual vintages of Orbis data, an endeavor which is in itself
a non-trivial research undertaking. In Section 2, we highlight the strengths and
weaknesses of this unique dataset for empirical research.
Our second contribution lies in the matching of foreign acquisitions to acquisitions by purely domestic firms in the same country as the FDI target: the large
size of our dataset allows us to study the effects of FDI in a sample where firms acquired by foreign firms are matched to similar firms acquired by domestic investors,
thereby isolating the “foreign” component of acquisitions from the acquisition itself,
as previously done by Chen (2011) and Wang and Wang (2015) for the United States
and China, respectively. By matching foreign acquisition to domestic acquisitions of
similar domestic firms and further showing that productivity effects materialize only
after four years and only when foreign owners take majority positions, we provide
evidence for a causal effect of foreign investment on productivity. The four-year lag
is consistent with new foreign owners reorganizing production, which takes time. If
our estimates were plagued by reverse casuality and/or selection bias, where foreign
owners were superior at identifying firms with future growth potential, it is unlikely
that this effect would show up only after four years. We further show that foreign
investment increases productivity while foreign divestment has no significant effect.
We show that our results are robust to changes in the definition of productivity, to
the choice of inputs in the production function, to the inclusion of a novel rich set of
fixed effects, and to variation in the sample of countries and periods. Specifically, the
results hold whether we: (1) measure productivity as labor productivity or total factor
productivity, (2) estimate productivity using Cobb-Douglas or translog production
3

The work to validate and compare this data to the official sources continues as described in
Kalemli-Ozcan, Sørensen, Villegas-Sanchez, Volosovych, and Yesiltas (2015), who provide detailed
evidence supporting the validity of the Orbis data.

functions, (3) measure labor input as employment or wage bill, or (4) measure capital
stock as tangible assets or the sum of tangible and intangible fixed assets. In addition,
the results are robust to using alternative methods for estimating productivity (the
one-step GMM estimation method of Wooldridge (2009) and the two-step control
function approach of Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015)).
Furthermore, the results hold for subsets of countries (for example, dropping Germany for which Orbis has less good coverage at the beginning of the sample, dropping
Norway and France for which only aggregate manufacturing producer price index deflators are available, or dropping Spain for which the tangible fixed asset series has a
break in 2008). The results also hold for the years before or after the Great Recession
and they are robust to using Generalized Least Squares (GLS) or Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS), to the inclusion of country-, sector-, or country-sector fixed effects,
and to some further permutations described in the empirical section and in the online
appendix.
For causal identification, we use propensity score methods (PSM) to match foreign
acquisitions with domestic acquisitions as similar as possible in observable characteristics prior to the acquisition. We estimate the impact of foreign acquisitions using
reduced-form linear regressions following the vast majority of papers in this literature.
The literature mostly matches foreign acquisitions with domestic firms not acquired
by foreign entities and interprets the estimates as the causal effect of FDI on productivity. Target firms are not randomly selected by foreign investors, but PSM is
designed to account for selection patterns that may lead to bias; in particular, the
tendency for foreign investors to acquire firms that are already highly productive.
As matching is based on variables that are observable to researchers, such as current
productivity, it cannot be ruled out that investors select firms that are likely to become more productive in the future. If foreign investors screen potential targets more
strongly and have a better sense of future growth potential, then PSM that matches
acquired firms to non acquired firms may not be causal. A PSM that matches firms
acquired by foreign investors to firms acquired by domestic investors, on the other
hand, is less likely to suffer from this issue unless foreign investors are somewhat
4

“smarter” than domestic investors in seeing the future growth potential. To further
guard against this low probability outcome, we do our PSM with considerable lags
and leads. We find that FDI affects productivity only after four years. These delayed
productivity effects strengthen the likelihood that the effects are casual as it is highly
unlikely that foreign investors forecast four-year ahead productivity-growth better
than domestic investors at the time of acquisition.
The FDI literature performs regressions in levels or in growth-rates (first-differences).
Firms with high productivity are more likely targets of FDI and in order to isolate the causal impact of FDI, researchers using levels-regressions typically include
firm-specific constants (“firm fixed effects”) in order to identify results from “within
variation;” that is, the relation between firm-level changes in FDI and productivity
over the sample period. Many authors (Aitken and Harrison, 1999; Javorcik, 2004;
Liu, 2008) find that the estimated effect of foreign acquisition on productivity is zero
when firm fixed effects are included in levels-regressions. An alternative to levelsregressions with firm fixed effects is to estimate relations in first-differences or growth
rates, where firm-specific constants difference out. We find this preferable as the error
terms are closer to white noise, therefore improving inference. Further, growth rates
of FDI at different lags are much less correlated than levels of FDI at different lags,
and for this reason, using growth-rate regressions it is possible to properly identify
coefficients to different FDI lags, thereby pinning down potential time delays in the
impact of FDI on productivity.
In order to control for potential effects coming from technology shocks taking
place at country and sector levels which may correlate with FDI, we include countrysector fixed effects.4 We also include lagged firm productivity, which controls for the
omitted variable bias that otherwise would occur due to the fact that firm productivity is mean-reverting. This is important and different from capturing unobserved
heterogeneity in current observed productivity with PSM and firm fixed effects. If
foreigners invest in current high-productivity firms, any productivity decline due to
4
Damijan, Kostevc, and Rojec (2015), who use firm-level data from seven recent Eastern European EU members to study pre- and post-acquisition performance of acquired firms, also use
country- and sector fixed effects.

5

mean-reversion in productivity will create an omitted variable bias if initial firmlevel productivity is not controlled for, therefore leading to a downward bias in the
estimated effect of foreign acquisitions on productivity.
Our work is related to extensive previous research. In terms of econometric specification, recent papers match foreign acquisitions to non-acquisitions (domestic firms)
or to domestic acquisitions and estimate productivity using methods similar to the
ones we use. They consider the impact on the growth rate or the log of productivity consistent with our specification. All the studies we are aware of focus on the
extensive margin by using dummy variables for foreign ownership. Some authors
allow for minority versus majority ownership (e.g., Chen (2011)) and some authors
(e.g., Wang and Wang (2015)) experiment with cut-offs in terms of foreign ownership
share when defining acquisition, but still use dummy variables for foreign ownership.
We estimate productivity regressions using either dummies for majority and minority
foreign ownership (the extensive margin) or continuous changes in foreign ownership
(the intensive margin) in order to examine which margin is more important and, in
particular, whether majority ownership—which imparts control—is crucial.
In terms of the data, we significantly depart from the existing literature by using
Orbis in a multi-country setting, covering a large representative set of domestic and
foreign firms with full financial information. Most existing research papers in this
field use survey data or more narrow datasets that only cover acquisitions, and hence
their control group of domestic firms are much smaller than our near-universe firms
coverage. For example, Javorcik and Poelhekke (2017) study disinvestment by foreign companies in Indonesia using survey data. Other papers with survey data are
Guadalupe, Kuzmina, and Thomas (2012) for Spain and Arnold and Javorcik (2009)
for Indonesia. These papers, and most others we are award of, have much smaller
samples than we have, with the exception of Wang and Wang (2015) who use a large
survey with about 125,000 firm-level observations per year for China. Papers using
acquisitions data in general focus on large firms for which financial information is
available. For example, Chen (2011) uses Compustat financial information and SDCThompson data on acquisitions and limits herself to very large (listed) U.S. firms
6

for which financial information is available in the Compustat database. In our data,
listed firms comprise less than 1% of the sample.
Some studies use total factor productivity as the dependent variable while others
use labor productivity. The results of studies using total factor productivity for
advanced countries vary between finding no effect of a foreign acquisition (e.g., Harris
and Robinson (2003) and Criscuolo and Martin (2009) for the UK, and Balsvik and
Haller (2010) for Norway) and finding a small effect in the 4% range (e.g., Karpaty
(2007) for Sweden and Fukao, Ito, Kwon, and Takizawa (2008) for Japan).
The literature for advanced countries using labor productivity tends to obtain a
large effect of foreign acquisitions: Guadalupe, Kuzmina, and Thomas (2012) find
an increase of 16% in Spain for majority foreign acquisitions, Chen (2011) finds an
increase of 13% for the United States (compared to a domestic acquisitions), and
Conyon, Girma, Thompson, and Wright (2002) document an increase of 13% for the
UK. An exception is Hanley and Zervos (2007), who find a decline of 9% after a
foreign acquisition for the UK. It may not be surprising that the impact is larger on
labor productivity as foreign owners may increase or improve the capital stock; indeed
Balsvik and Haller (2010) find an increase in labor productivity of 10% for Norway
even as they found no effect on total factor productivity. Overall, the literature for
advanced countries points to moderate effects on total factor productivity and larger
effects on labor productivity.
The effect of a foreign acquisition is likely to be different in developing countries
and is likely also dependent on local institutions. Arnold and Javorcik (2009) find a
large 15% productivity increase (after three years) for Indonesia, while Stiebale and
Vencappa (2018) find no effect for India and Wang and Wang (2015) find no effect for
China (compared to a domestic acquisitions). Damijan, Kostevc, and Rojec (2015)
find, for Eastern European countries, a large effect on labor productivity for targets
with previously low productivity—an issue that we do not explore.
The studies that allow for dynamics, as we do, tend to find a delayed effect: in
Blonigen, Fontagne, Sly, and Toubal (2012) productivity at first declines and then
recovers while Guadalupe, Kuzmina, and Thomas (2012) and Arnold and Javorcik
7

(2009) find positive effects that grow larger with time.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the data, discusses
the benefits and drawbacks of the Orbis data, and describes the construction of the
variables. Section 3 discusses our empirical methodology. Section 4 introduces the
empirical specification. Section 5 presents the results and Section 6 concludes.

Data and Construction of Variables

We use the Orbis database assembled by Bureau van Dijk (BvD) (a Moody’s company). Orbis allows us to perform a multi-country study on a dataset that is harmonized across countries. BvD collects data from various sources, in particular, national
business registries, and harmonizes the data into an internationally comparable format. The Orbis database covers more than 200 countries and over 200 million firms
(private and publicly listed), with the longitudinal dimension and representativeness
of the firms varying from country to country depending on whether the smallest firms
are required to file information with business registries. The Orbis database is not
a census, as it is based on firms’ filings of accounts and the requirements for filing
varies by country as listed in the online appendix. We believe that the productivity
effects from foreign acquisitions that we document based on the Orbis data are very
informative and provide a value supplement to existing work, but because the data
construction is an independent contribution of this paper, we outline the strengths
and weaknesses of our dataset in more detail.

2.1

Strengths of the dataset

Most previous studies using cross-country datasets are based on listed companies
(often the Worldscope database, which is now a part of ThomsonONE product by
Thomson Reuters). One advantage of Orbis is that it includes private firms and,
importantly, small firms which are key if we are to derive implications for the aggregate
economy. Another advantage of Orbis is that it provides (foreign and domestic)
information about the owners of both listed and private firms, including name, country
8

of residence, and type (e.g., bank, industrial company, private equity, individual)
allowing us to identify changes in ownership that, with some effort, can be compiled
into time-series of ownership over time. Exploiting time-varying information on the
percentage stakes of foreign entities allows us to evaluate, among other things, whether
intensive margin changes have different effects than extensive margin changes. In the
current paper, we document that our results are mainly driven by transitions to
foreign majority ownership. Besides detailed time series of ownership information,
the Orbis dataset has detailed financial information which, among other things, is
important for matching purposes. No other dataset has both types of information for
private firms in a large set of countries.
Further, no other representative dataset has information on the percentage of capital stock owned, nationality of the owner, type of owner, and financial information
of the owner and the target, over time. For example, the Thompson SDC Platinum
database (also merged into ThomsonONE) gives the information on the ownership
stakes and financial information based on M&A deals and, therefore, is limited to
these transactions only. Orbis feeds in the M&A data from Zephyr, a source similar
to Thompson SDC, and fills in missing information on the full ownership structure
of the companies involved in M&A deals from alternative sources. In addition, Orbis provides ownership information for firms that were not directly involved in an
M&A transaction (greenfield investments both by foreign and domestic owners).5
For each firm, we have full balance sheet information over time and sector codes at
the four-digit NACE level. Firms are linked to their domestic and foreign parents
through unique ID numbers, which allows us to construct precise firm-level measures
of changes in foreign investment in firms over time based on changes in ownership
stakes by foreigners.
5

To asses the coverage of the foreign ownership information, we compare the turnover reported
by Orbis firms in our sample to the turnover reported by MNCs in the OECD AMNE database
(Activity of Multinational Enterprises). Table A.3 in the online appendix shows high correlation
between the two datasets and levels are also close, though in most cases our data captures a higher
level of foreign output.

9

2.2

Weaknesses of the dataset

Orbis provides ownership information as a snapshot of the year for which data are
purchased and time series information on foreign ownership can only be achieved
by using separate vintages and merging these into time series. This is a labor intensive process as explained in detail in Kalemli-Ozcan, Sørensen, Villegas-Sanchez,
Volosovych, and Yesiltas (2015), but it is necessary to go back to historical vintages
in order to avoid the survivorship bias that would results because more productive
and/or foreign-owned firms are more likely to survive. In that paper, we discuss several practical issues when merging information across vintages (e.g, changes in the
sector classification over time, differences in currencies, differences in units, etc.).6
Coverage varies across countries because of different filing requirements which
we list in online appendix Table A.1 for the countries in our sample. The choice
of countries included in this paper is made aiming at mitigating concerns about low
coverage. In online appendix Table A.2, we show how coverage varies by country with
more details available in Kalemli-Ozcan, Sørensen, Villegas-Sanchez, Volosovych, and
Yesiltas (2015). We focus on Western European countries for which our data covers
at least 30% of the manufacturing output once we have imposed the condition of
non-missing sales, capital stock, wage bill, and material expenditure—variables that
are necessary for computing total factor productivity. Austria and Portugal are not
included despite fulfilling these conditions because their coverage is unstable over our
time frame.
Coverage improves over time and more very small firms are added in later vintages;
however, very small firms are not often targets of foreign acquisition and therefore
the matched regression sample is hardly affected by this. We display extensive sets
of robustness regressions which show that our main results are unlikely to be affected
by uneven coverage. To further alleviate concerns about uneven and time-varying
country coverage, we focus on a sample of firms with more than ten employees. This
choice also allows us to better benchmark our results to the existing literature, which
6

A new dataset, called “Historical Product,” launched by BvD in 2017 is intended to alleviate
these problems.

10

is mainly based on manufacturing censuses of firms with more than ten (or even
twenty) employees (see Arnold and Javorcik (2009) for Indonesia, Javorcik (2004) for
Lithuania, or Haskel, Pereira, and Slaughter (2007) for the UK).
Orbis is unsuited for studying entry and exit decisions and we refrain from studying
those in this analysis. In general, entry can be better measured because the date of
company incorporation is available for most firms; however, it is not possible to
accurately distinguish between exit from the sample and exit from production. We
show that our results are similar if we perform our analysis on a sample of firms
present during the whole sample period, so it unlikely that the result of this paper
are biased due to exit and entry. We choose to start our sample in 1999 when coverage
for European countries was improved due to Financial Sector Action Plan (FSAP)
rules that were launched together with the Euro.
We next describe the main firm-level variables used in the analysis. More details
on the cleaning process and firm-level statistics are provided in the online appendix.

2.3

Firm-Level Productivity

Our main dependent variable is total factor productivity at the firm-level. We assume
that firm i’s output is determined by a Cobb-Douglas production function (CD),
Yit = T F Pit Lβit` Kitβk ,

(1)

where firm value added, Yit , is a function of productivity (T F Pit ) and firm inputs
(Lit , Kit ). Lit is labor input, Kit is capital input, βk is the output elasticity of capital,
and β` is the output elasticity of labor. We measure nominal value added, Pit Yit ,
where Pit stands for the price of output of firm i, as the difference between gross
output (operating revenue) and expenditure on materials. As is the case for almost
all relevant datasets, prices are not available at the firm level, and we calculate “real”
output, Yit , by dividing nominal value added with Eurostat two-digit industry price
deflators. This is still a revenue based measure because firm level prices are not

11

available to deflate revenue.7 Labor input, Lit , is measured as the firm’s wage bill
(deflated by the same two-digit industry price deflator).8 Finally, we measure the
capital stock, Kit , as the book value of tangible fixed assets, deflated by the price of
investment goods.9
We obtain firm-level revenue total factor productivity estimates as a residual:
log(T F Pit ) = log(Yit ) − β̂` log(Lit ) − βˆk log(Kit ) ,

(2)

where the output/revenue elasticity measures, β̂` and βˆk are primarily estimated
following the GMM approach suggested in Wooldridge (2009).
There is a broad literature on various methodologies for estimating production
functions (see Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015) for a review) and we apply the two
most recent methods: the one-step GMM estimation method of Wooldridge (2009)
and the two-step control function approach of Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015).
This literature was pioneered by Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin
(2003). The estimation methods rely on an observable—the “proxy—being a function
of the unobserved productivity level. The early contributions to the literature on
estimating production functions differed mainly by the choice of proxy, investment in
the case of OP and materials in the case of LP. Wooldridge’s approach uses materials
as a proxy. Wooldridge’s method uses a system estimation rather than a two-step
estimation but it takes into account the Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015) critique,
that if labor is partly hired before productivity is known, the coefficient on labor input
7

Norway and France do not have industry price deflators at the two-digit level, and we use the
total manufacturing industry price deflator for these two countries. In Table 4, we show that our
results are robust to excluding France and Norway from the analysis. Our baseline estimates of total
factor productivity include time-year dummies and therefore control for changes in aggregate prices.
8
Using the wage bill, rather than the head count, helps adjust for differences in the quality of
workers across firms because more skilled workers normally are paid more. However, as noted by
Hsieh and Klenow (2009), wages could be impacted by rent sharing within the firm, leading to biased
measures of revenue productivity. We re-estimated total factor productivity using employment as a
measure of labor input and show in the online appendix Table A.10 that our results are robust.
9
We use country-specific prices of investment from the World Development Indicators to deflate
the book value of tangible fixed assets. Spain experienced a change in the accounting system in
2007 (leasing items that until 2007 had been part of intangible fixed assets were from 2008 included
under tangible fixed assets). We show that our results are robust to using the sum of tangible and
intangible fixed assets as our measure of capital stock in online appendix Table A.10. In addition,
Table 4 shows that the results are robust to excluding Spain from the analysis.

12

will not be correctly identified in the first step of the estimation. We estimate the
production function by country and two-digit sector and winsorize the resulting firm
level productivity distribution at the 1st and 99th percentiles by country.
While our baseline results follow the Wooldridge (2009) estimation procedure,
we show that the results are robust to alternative production function estimation
methods, to alternative assumptions about common technology across countries, to
the choice of functional form of the production function, and to the use of more simple
productivity measures, such as labor productivity. We estimate production functions
by country and two-digit industry; but we also show results from estimating a common
production function by two-digit industry, assuming that the production function is
sector-specific but common across countries. We also consider a more flexible translog
production function (TL). Finally, we consider two measures of labor productivity,
value added over number of employees and sales over number of employees; however,
the correlation between the growth rates of these measures is very high as shown in
online appendix Table A.9.

2.4

Firm-Level Foreign Ownership

To construct our main independent variable, we calculate for each firm the share of
foreign ownership using Orbis data. The database refers to each record of ownership
as an “ownership link.” An ownership link indicating that an entity A owns a certain
percentage of firm B’s equity (voting shares) is referred to as a “direct” ownership link.
BvD records direct links between two entities even when the ownership percentages
are very small (sometimes less than one percent). For listed companies, very small
stockholders are typically unknown.10 We compute “foreign ownership” of firm i at
time t, FOit , as the sum of all percentages of direct ownership by foreigners in that year,
and we repeat this calculation for every year.11 We define a firm to be “domestic” if
10

Countries have different rules for when the identity of a minority owner needs to be disclosed
for listed firms. France requires listed firms to disclose all owners with a stake larger than 5%, while
Italy requires listed firms to disclose all owners with a stake larger than 2%.
11
For example, if a company has three foreign owners with stakes of 10, 15, and 35%, the foreign
ownership fraction for this company is 60%. The following year, the company may have a fourth
foreign owner with a stake of 10%, in which case foreign ownership would become 70% and the

13

it did not have any foreign owner during the sample period.
Figure 1 displays the distribution of foreign ownership across firms. Panel (a)
shows that close to 90% of firms in the sample are domestic firms (i.e., firms that
never had a foreign owner during the period of analysis). Panel (b) shows that among
foreign-owned firms (i.e., those that had at least one foreign owner during the sample
period) more than 80% were majority-owned.

Notes: Panel (a) shows the distribution of domestic, minority and majority-foreign owned firms,
respectively, in the full sample. Panel (b) focuses on the sample of foreign-owned firms and shows
the distribution of minority and majority owners.

Because we are interested in the effect of changes in foreign ownership on the
productivity of target firms after acquisition, we follow Guadalupe, Kuzmina, and
Thomas (2012) and focus on the sample of firms that have no foreign ownership the
first time they appear in the sample. We define a firm to be a majority-owned foreign
firm if the foreign ownership is 50% or more after the acquisition. If ownership were
very dispersed across owners (for example, if majority foreign-owned firms were owned
by 50 different foreign owners, each holding a 1% ownership stake) our interpretation
of 50% ownership as controlling ownership would be problematic. We therefore control
for the number of owners, although most majority foreign-owned firms have only
one owner. Specifically, 75% have a single owner, while the 95th percentile of the
year-to-year change would be 10 percentage points.

Endogenous Selection and Identification

In Figure 2, we plot the initial productivity of firms that are acquired versus those
that are not. More precisely, the figure shows the density distribution of initial productivity (in terms of deviations from country and sector means) for the sample of
domestic firms which are not acquired, and for the sample of firms which are initially
domestic but have some foreign ownership four years later.

Notes: Initial productivity at the firm level is measured by total factor productivity (log TFP) in the
first year the firm appears in the sample, demeaned by sector and country over the sample period.
The solid line represents (log TFP) of domestic firms (firms that originally do not have any foreign
ownership and remain non-acquired after four years (t+4)). In panel (a), the dashed line refers to
foreign owned firms (those that are originally domestic but were acquired at some point during the
next four years (t+4)). In panel (b), the dashed line refers to foreign majority-owned firms (those
that are originally domestic but were majority owned by a foreign investor four years after (t+4));
the dotted-dashed line refers to minority owned foreign firms (those that are originally domestic but
were minority owned by a foreign investor four years after (t+4)).

The distributions of the two groups of firms in panel (a) in Figure 2 are quite
similar, but among the firms that are acquired, there is less mass at the overall
average productivity level and more mass at the highest level of productivity. So
while there is a large spread in the distribution of the initial productivity of acquired
15

firms, there is also a clear tendency for foreign acquisitions to be concentrated in
firms with the highest level of productivity. It is evident that foreign investors do not
select firms randomly.
In panel (b), we separate the sample of firms that are acquired by foreigners with
total majority and minority foreign stake. The distribution of initial productivity
of firms that are subsequently acquired and have foreign minority ownership have
a higher variance than those acquired by foreign majority owners. Some foreign
minority owners invest in a priori low-productivity domestic firms while other foreign
minority owners invest in a priori high-productivity firms; that is why we see two
humps in the distribution. However, both majority and minority foreign investors,
on average, invest in firms with above-average productivity. In the next section, we
explore the relationship between foreign ownership and productivity using regression
analysis, controlling for country- and sector-level trends, and for mean-reversion in
initial productivity, using propensity score matching techniques to control for possible
non-random selection of firms by foreign investors.

3.1

Matching

Foreign-acquired firms tend to be different from non-foreign-acquired firms and a
regression of an outcome on foreign acquisition without correcting for this, might
interpret a positive coefficient as a causal effect of the foreign acquisition even if it
may be reflection of other differences between foreign-acquired and other firms. It is
therefore common to match the foreign-acquired firms to similar domestic firms (with
not foreign ownership) in order to interpret the estimated coefficients causally.We
match foreign-acquired firms to similar domestic-acquired firms. We define a foreign
acquisition as the event that a foreign entity acquires any stake (no matter how small)
in a company with no identified foreign owner before the event. A domestic acquisition
is the event that a domestic investor acquires any stake (no matter how small) in a
company where this investor was not previously a shareholder. To identify domestic
acquisitions, we need to identify unique owners (as opposed to the nationality of the
owner in the foreign case) and trace their changes over time. Our firm-owner-year
16

data allows us to achieve this goal.
We drop firms that remained foreign throughout the sample period and we drop
firms that experienced multiple foreign acquisitions. We retain for our initial sample
all domestic acquisitions except firms that experienced multiple domestic acquisitions.
We use a combined set of these two sets of firms to construct the matched sample based
on observable characteristics (“matching variables”). Matching is done by estimating
a probability (logit) model of the probability of being acquired by a foreign firm and
selecting a subset of foreign and domestic firms with similar probabilities.
Our choice of variables to include in the probability estimation is guided by existing papers on foreign acquisitions (such as Arnold and Javorcik (2009); Javorcik and
Poelhekke (2017)) and we follow the general advise of Roberts and Whited (2013).
Specifically, we use as explanatory variables the second lags of the following variables:
the log of productivity, log employment, log wage bill, log tangible fixed assets to employment, log total assets, log company age, the squares of log assets and log age, the
growth of assets; and the first and second lag of the growth rates of productivity (our
outcome variable). Lagged values of the dependent variable are included in order to
hedge again the regressions spuriously picking up pre-existing trends with the foreign
acquisition variables. The estimated coefficients are reported in online appendix Table A.5. The fitted probability value is known in this literature as the “propensity
score.”
We match firms based on this propensity score to domestic acquisitions in the
same country, two-digit industry, and year. We drop foreign-acquired firms for which
the propensity score is higher than the maximum or less than the minimum propensity
score of the domestic-acquired firms. For each remaining foreign-acquired firm, we
match with up to two domestic firms, but domestic firms can be chosen as a match
more than once, resulting in a “many-to-many” matched sample.12 We delete matches
for which the probability of selection differs by more than twenty percentage points (“a
0.2 caliper of the propensity score”). As a test of validity, we verify that the average
values of the observable firms’ characteristics do not statistically differ between the

a specification where the country-sector dummy is replaced with a country and a
sector dummy φs4 + δc ), and i,t is a mean zero error term. The lag length of four
is chosen from pre-testing: as reported in online appendix Table A.11, we find no
effect of foreign ownership with three lags and if we include five lags, the fifth lag is
insignificant.14
We regress productivity growth on the logarithm of (1+percent foreign ownership
share).15 Productivity may depend on foreign ownership concentration, so we control
13
We conducted a thorough robustness analysis by estimating the regressions on alternative
matched samples. We found that the results are robust to a number of changes in the matching procedure. In particular, we tried a) changing the domestic sample to include both domestic
acquired and domestic non-acquired firm (this was reported in the first version of this paper); b)
changing the foreign-acquired sample to include any foreign-owned firm and changing the definition
of “acquisitions” to be any change in foreign ownership; c) using nearest-neighbor one-to-one matching rather than two-neighbor caliper matching; d) changing the set of matching variables, matching
using various measures of productivity (productivity based on tangible K (the reported results), labor productivity rather than total factor productivity, and using measures of productivity calculated
using tangible plus intangible K), and using different values for the caliper. The permutations all
delivered similar results for impact of foreign acquisition on productivity.
14
The finding of a four period lagged effects is very robust but, for brevity, we only report these
lags for the alternative specification using dummies for foreign majority acquisition.
15
We add the number 1 in order to allow for zero values of x. log (1 + x) ≈ x when x is small, so

18

for the number of foreign owners—the number of foreign owners correlates with the
share of foreign ownership, potentially leading to omitted-variable bias if that variable
is omitted. Productivity may be mean-reverting and because foreign investors target high-productivity firms, changes in foreign ownership may mechanically correlate
with changes in productivity. In this case, one would underestimate the productivity
impact of foreign investment if one does not control for lagged productivity because
the high-productivity firms are likely to be acquired by foreigners at the same time as
they are likely to have productivity declining from a high level. We therefore include
the previously existing productivity level in the regression.16 We assume that the
error term is orthogonal to the regressors and independent across firms, but the error
variances may vary across firms, in which case feasible GLS is asymptotically efficient
and our firm-clustered standard errors are consistent in the case of auto-correlation
in the residuals.17 We estimate our relations using feasible GLS, allowing for firmspecific weights but in robustness tables we display OLS results. The weights are the
inverse of the square root of firm-level mean squared residuals from an initial OLS
estimation.

Empirical Results

In Table 1, we display results using our full (non-matched) sample and various definitions of productivity. Our main variable of interest is total factor productivity;
however, we also show robustness using labor productivity which is simply value
added divided by the number of workers—while we are mainly interested in total
factor productivity, it lends credence to our results if they are not solely the result
of sophisticated and somewhat opaque calculations of productivity. We also show
the regression coefficient on foreign ownership is best interpreted as a semi-elasticity.
16
In a previous version of the paper, we used productivity in the first period the firm is observed
in order to minimize correlation with the foreign ownership regressors, but here we simply use the
first lag of the productivity level. This choice has little to no effect on the results of interest. In
the previous version, we also used a presample lagged value as an instrument, following the logic of
Arellano and Bond (1991), and this also had little effect on the results. .
17
Using the residuals from the differenced regression, we find an AR(1) coefficient of −0.2. This
is significantly different from 0, but close enough to zero that correcting for this autocorrelation in
the regressions would matter little.

19

results using output (operating revenues) per worker as a rough measure of labor
productivity. In addition, we address sensitivity to how total factor productivity is
estimated—with parameters of the production function estimated by sector or by
country-sector, by the method of Wooldridge (2009), or the method of Ackerberg,
Caves, and Frazer (2015) (ACF). We also explore if a translog production function
delivers different results.
The regressions include the change in the number of foreign owners and lagged
productivity, but we do not report the estimated coefficients in most tables. Lagged
productivity is highly significant and the inclusion of this variable is important for
our findings—indeed, omitted variable bias from its exclusion may explain why some
studies in the literature has found not effect of foreign acquisition.18
Columns (1)–(5) display results for total factor productivity while columns (6)–(7)
show results for labor productivity. The first two columns show results using total
factor productivity estimated following Wooldridge while the next three columns show
results using productivity estimated following ACF. Across all those specification, we
find that an increase in foreign ownership increases productivity after four years, while
the impact is not robustly statistically significant for previous years, with the exception of labor productivity for which we also find a significant impact after three years.
The magnitude of the four-year impact is very robust although the “ACF estimates”
at 1.4–1.7% are slightly (not significantly) smaller than the “Wooldridge estimates”
of 2.7–2.9%.19 The impact on foreign acquisition on labor productivity measured
as value added over labor is larger (but not significantly so) than the “Wooldridge
estimates,” while the impact on operating revenue per worker is at about the same
size. Overall, the data supports a small but significant delayed productivity effect of
an increase in foreign ownership.
“Post hoc ergo propter hoc” (after this, therefore resulting from it) has long been
18

The estimated coefficients for these variable are tabulated in the online appendix for one specification in Table A.11.
19
We do not tabulate p-values for test of similarity of coefficients because we are not testing any
formal hypothesis. But if the difference between coefficients are not at least two times the largest
standard error in absolute value, the coefficients are not significantly different from each other at
the 5% level.

20

recognized as a potential fallacy, but a four-year delay in the productivity pick-up
seems consistent with a causal effect of new owners reorganizing the firm. Causality
would be broken if foreigners identified domestic firms which, regardless of actual
changes in ownership, would become more productive in four years. The regressions
in Table 1 compares changes in foreign ownership with firms that have no foreign
owners; however, the results may confound effects of any changes in ownership with
effects of FDI. In order to address this possibility we, in Table 2, compare foreign
acquisitions to domestic acquisitions using a sample of firms with changes in foreign
ownership matched to domestic firms with changes in ownership.20 We show results
using the Wooldridge productivity estimates but results are robust to alternative productivity estimates.

indicates one-year changes. The dependent variable in columns (6) and (7) is the change in firm-level labor productivity ( value added over number
of employees and output over number of employees, respectively). In columns (1) and (3) the productivity elasticities are estimated by country and
two-digit industry while in columns (2), (4) and (5) elasticities are estimated by two-digit industry. In columns (1) and (2) the productivity estimation
method follows Wooldridge (2009) (WLP). In columns (3) to (5) the productivity estimation method follows Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015)
(ACF). Columns (1) to (4) estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function (CD) while column (5) estimates a translog production function (TL).
∆ log(FO) is the yearly change in the log(FO + 1) where FO stands for percent foreign ownership. t − 1, t − 2, t − 3 and t − 4 refers to lags one, two,

TFPi,t ).

The estimated parameters (0.019–0.021%) for the impact of foreign investment
after four years in Table 2 are slightly smaller than those found for the full sample.
While the difference is only borderline significant (from a comparison of the difference with the standard errors), it is intuitive that the coefficient is slightly smaller
contrasted with domestic acquisitions as some domestic investors improve the productivity of their targets. In this table, we highlight that the results are not sensitive
to the inclusion of sector- and country-fixed effects or sector-country fixed effects and
that the lag structure is exactly as it was for the previous sample. We will mainly
show results using the large set of country-sector fixed effects going forward, but this
choice does not impact our results.

The results in Table 3 include four types of variables: (i) change towards a foreign
majority ownership; (ii) change away from a foreign majority ownership; (iii) change
towards a foreign minority ownership; and (iv) change away from a foreign minority
ownership. We introduce four lags for each of these variables, leading to a total of 16
estimated coefficients presented in the table. The table is heavily parameterized, in
order to attempt to sort out the effect of foreign minority and majority acquisitions
and “divestments,” so some coefficients are significant in some columns and not in
others and we do not in general comment on those.21 The estimated coefficient for
the 4-year lagged change towards a foreign majority ownership is robustly estimated
at around 0.012–0.019%.
A move out of foreign minority ownership after one year has a positive effect on
productivity—if this is associated with a change towards a foreign majority ownership, the net effect in column (3) is 0.08 (0.018—0.010) which is clearly not significant.
A change to domestic ownership would have a positive effect of 0.018, but the cumulative impact will be nil as the impact after four years is –0.023 leading to a cumulative
impact of –0.005. Javorcik and Poelhekke (2017) found a negative effect on divestment in Indonesia, but it is intuitive that divestment to domestic owners may have no
effect in advanced economies. However, our focus is on the effect of foreign acquisitions and, in column (2), we drop dummies for changes away from foreign ownership.
In this column, the effect of majority foreign acquisition after four years is 0.017.
There is a negative effect of majority acquisition after one year, but this is only significant at the 10% level and not robust in column (3). The effect of foreign minority
acquisition is significant at the 10% level after four years which may reflect that some
minority owners take control and improve on productivity, but given the low level of
significance, we drop the dummies for foreign minority acquisition in column (3). In
this more parsimonious regression, there is a significant impact on productivity after
four years of being acquired by a foreign firm with a majority stake, but not earlier.
We will focus on the impact of a change to foreign majority ownership and turn to
21
We do not have enough degrees of freedom to include even more terms, so we do not have
separate dummies for whether a foreign minority holding changes to a foreign majority holding or
to a domestic holding, so the term “divestment” is used loosely.

Table 4: Foreign Ownership and Productivity - Robustness

Table 4 displays the results of a number of robustness exercises. For easy reference,
we repeat the last column of Table 3, which we refer to as our baseline specification.
In all columns, the impact of foreign majority acquisition is significant while other
coefficients are not, apart from one coefficient that is significant at the 10% level in
column (3) only. Our comments about this table therefore are all about the impact
of foreign majority acquisition after four years. Column (2) displays OLS estimates.
Again, foreign majority acquisitions have a positive impact only after four years—
the OLS-estimated coefficient is larger at 0.026 but it is not more significant than
the GLS-estimated coefficient as the standard errors are larger for the less efficient
OLS-estimator.
The following columns return to using GLS and columns (3)–(5) examine the
sensitivity to certain countries. Column (3) drops Spain, for which there was a change
in accounting rules in middle of our sample, and column (4) drops Germany, for which
coverage is relatively low in early years, but the results in either case are similar to
the baseline. Column (5) drops France and Norway for which we do not have sector
specific deflators. The coefficient, at 0.022, is somewhat larger than the baseline
coefficient, but the overall result remains, that there is a small impact on productivity
only after four years.
Column (5) examines if our results are driven by foreign-acquired firms surviving
longer than domestic-acquired firms. This could lead to bias if foreign-acquired firms
with low productivity do not survive four years in which case they will not be in
our regression sample. We therefore examine if the results remain when we use a
balanced sample of acquired firms where there is no exit for neither foreign-acquired
nor domestic-acquired firms. The estimated coefficients are very close to the baseline
results, implying that the outcomes we find are not an artifact of relatively more exits
of weakly performing foreign-acquired firms. Column (7) revisits the effect on labor
productivity and finds a slightly larger coefficient than the baseline results, but with
the same pattern of a small effect on productivity after four years. Columns (8) and
(9) show that results are robust to following ACF estimation strategy. Column (9)
shows results when productivity is calculated under a translog production function;
29

the fourth lag is still significant and of the same order of magnitude as the previous
results.
We conclude that there is robust evidence for a small positive effect only after
four years. In the online appendix, we further show that the results are similar when
comparing the years before and after the Great Recession and robust to alternative
ways of measuring of capital (include intangibles or not) and labor inputs (wage bill
or number of workers).

Summary and conclusion

We construct a panel dataset for eight advanced European countries tracking foreign
investment over time at the firm level. Our dataset is based on the Orbis database
which provides data for both listed and unlisted firms. To generate consistent time
series, we combine several vintages of the raw data, because each Orbis vintage only
provides a snapshot of foreign investment in a given year. For identification, we use
PSM and match foreign acquisitions to domestic acquisitions. We find that the productivity of firms acquired by foreign investors increases modestly after four years
and only when they are acquired by foreign majority owners. This finding survives
several permutations of the way we perform the productivity estimation and variations of sample used. The results suggest that the productivity benefits of foreign
investment are realized only when foreigners acquire corporate control and affect production decisions. We believe our large multi-country dataset helps us pin down the
average effect in developed countries and our finding of a small delayed effect may
partly explain why some authors have concluded that no effect exists.
Our results have the following policy implications. First, if foreign investors acquire a majority ownership, this delivers positive productivity benefits; hence, hostility to large take-overs by foreign firms in Europe may be misguided. Second, the
effect of foreign investment on acquired firms’ productivity is gradual and quite small.
This implies that explanations for the high macroeconomic correlations found between
growth and foreign investment has to come from elsewhere. While this is a topic for
30

further research, we speculate that they may be due to either reverse causality where
growth-enhancing structural reforms and improved policy attracts multinationals or
due to knowledge spillover effects from acquired to non-acquired domestic firms.

Online Appendix

In this appendix, we provide more details about the data, showing coverage of financial information—aggregated firm level operating revenue compared to the corresponding series from Eurostat statistics—and give details by country about the firms’
filing requirements that underly the coverage of the dataset; and ownership coverage
comparing to official OECD MNCs activity series as well as describe the number of
acquisitions and compare to other sources like Thompson SDC and Zephyr. We give
details about our matching procedure in terms of probability estimation and balancing test and we display tables that show robustness with respect to data construction,
countries included in the sample, and specification issues such as number of lags to
include. Finally, we give details about the estimation of total factor productivity.

Further Data Details
Table A.1 provides a detailed tabulation of filing requirements by country. In
some countries, very small firms do not have to file accounts, but the details vary
by country. Table A.2 compares, by country, operating revenue aggregated over the
firms in our sample with aggregate operating revenue as reported by Eurostat. We
show numbers for our full sample as well as for the sample of firms for which we are
able to calculate total factor productivity. We do not have data for the self-employed
and firms that do not file accounts with official sources—these firms are typically
very small as can be gleaned from Table A.1, which reports filing requirements by
country. Very small firms are unlikely to be acquired by foreigners, so this type of
non-perfect coverage is unlikely to affect our estimates, which we confirm by a number
of robustness exercises.
For brevity, we comment only on the sample of firms reporting operating revenue.
Belgium: 75% coverage (relative to Eurostat) in 1999, stable over time. Finland: 30%
coverage in 1999, increasing (monotonically) to 51% in 2012. France: 64% coverage
in 1999, increasing to 95% in 2012. Germany: 21% coverage in 1999, increasing to

36

48% in 2012. Italy: 61% coverage in 1999, increasing to 86% in 2012. Norway: 66%
coverage in 1999, increasing to 88% in 2012. Spain: 75% coverage in 1999, increasing
to 83% in 2012. Sweden: 60% coverage in 1999, increasing to 78% in 2012. The
average coverage varies across countries and so does the rate at which it increases.
Because of this, we show that the results are robust to leaving out subsets of countries,
in particular Germany, which has the lowest coverage in early years.
In Table A.3, we show, by country, the operating revenue of foreign owned firms
in our Orbis sample (where we define a firm as “foreign owned” if the sum of foreign
ownership shares is at least 10%) and the operating revenue of MNCs as identified by
the OECD. In panel A, we report the sum of turnover by country and year while in
panel B, we report the sum of turnover by country and year where the turnover of each
firm is weighted by the foreign ownership share. The Orbis numbers are in general
quite close to those of the OECD, although the numbers in Orbis are substantially
higher for Norway and Finland in panel A. Using turnover weighted by the foreign
ownership shares, the data are of the same order of magnitude between the OECD
data and Orbis, although far from identical (for example, for Germany $247 Bill.
using OECD and $147 Bill. using Orbis). The Orbis data are not constructed the
same way as the OECD data and one should not expect a perfect match; however, the
similar magnitudes are reassuring. The Orbis numbers are based on foreign shares
of equity for each firm with foreign investment, while the OECD data are based on
surveys of the investing MNCs (where the definition of MNC may vary by country).
The very different approaches should give similar magnitudes but cannot be expected
to give identical numbers. The time series correlations reported in each panel are
positive for all countries but France (which we verify can be dropped without changing
estimated coefficients significantly) and for most countries are around 0.70 in panel A
and slightly lower in panel B.
Table A.4 documents how we arrive at our sample of 1,063 foreign acquired firms
and 9,481 domestically acquired firm in the matched sample. In the overall sample, we
have 23,200 foreign firms and 3,174 foreign-acquired firms. The table shows, among
other things, how this number gets whittled down when we leave out financial com37

panies, require non-missing values for the variables needed to calculate productivity,
and require at least four lags. A number of foreign-acquired firms are also left out by
the matching algorithm because no good domestic-acquired match exists.

Matching
We match the foreign-acquired firms to a sample of similar domestic-acquired
firms. As explained in a the text, we estimate a logit regression with the probability
that any share of a firm is acquired by a foreign entity. owned as a function of observable characteristics, measured before the firm becomes acquired. As independent
variables, we include, for the first year the firm appears in the sample, the levels
and squares of employment, assets, age, the level of value added per employee, the
logarithm of capital stock per employee, and wages per worker. Roberts and Whited
(2013) recommend to match on growth rates of outcome variables to ensure similarity
of pre-treatment trends. We include productivity growth in the first year the firm is
in the sample, and productivity in each of the two years before the foreign firm was
acquired. For firms which were not acquired, we use the level of productivity in the
first year the firm is in the sample and the first two years for growth.
We pre-clean the sample entering the matching by dropping firms that remained
foreign throughout the sample period and firms which experienced multiple foreign
acquisitions. We retain all domestic acquisitions to be used as control events but drop
firms which experienced multiple domestic acquisitions. We construct the matched
sample based on observable characteristics, relying on the existing papers on foreign
acquisitions (such as Arnold and Javorcik (2009); Javorcik and Poelhekke (2017)) and
the survey by Roberts and Whited (2013). Specifically, we match on the second lags
of the following variables: log of productivity, log of employment, log wage bill, log
of tangible fixed assets to employment, log of total assets, log of company age, the
squares of log-assets and log-age, the growth of assets; and the first and second lag of
the growth rates of productivity (our outcome variable), which helps ensure similarity
of pre-treatment trends.
38

Matching is done by estimating a probability (logit) model of the probability of being acquired by a foreign firm and and selecting a subset of foreign and domestic firms
with similar probabilities. The logit estimation results are tabulated in Table A.5. It
is clear that firms that are large in terms of assets, have high employment, have high
wage bill are significantly more likely to be acquired. Conditional on the other regressors, the coefficient to productivity two years prior to acquisition is negative as are
the productivity growth rates in each of the two years before acquisition. However,
the specification is intended to obtain the best fitted probability value (known as the
“propensity score”) and, therefore, heavily parameterized, so individual coefficients
should not be structurally interpreted.
Using this predicted probability of foreign acquisitions, we match within the same
country, two-digit industry, and year.22 We match with replacement and drop observations whose propensity score is higher than the maximum or less than the minimum
propensity score of the controls. In the baseline implementation, for each treated
company, we keep the two closest domestic acquisitions except we delete matches for
which the probability of selection differs by more than twenty percentage points (“a
0.2 caliper of the propensity score”) and we drop foreign-acquired firms for which the
propensity score is higher than the maximum or less than the minimum propensity
score of the domestic-acquired firms. For each remaining foreign-acquired firm, we
match with up to two domestic firms, but domestic firms can be chosen as a match
more than once, resulting in a “many-to-many” matched sample consisting of 1,141
foreign-acquired firms and 1,539 domestic-acquired firms, as reported in the appendix
Table A.4.
In Table A.6, we test if the selected domestic-acquired firms are similar to the
foreign-acquired firms in our sample—“balancing” tests. The main takeaway is that
in all cases the differences between the means of includes variables for the foreignacquired and the domestic-acquired firms are statistically insignificant. We further
examine if variances are similar between the foreign-acquired and domestic-acquired
firms. For most variables, the range is in range normally considered acceptable while
22

We use the popular Stata psmatch2 command written by E. Leuven and B. Sianesi.

39

for lagged asset and unemployment, the variance is somewhat higher for the foreignacquired firms; however, the ratios between 1.35 and 1.53 are not extreme.23 —

Summary Statistics Table A.7 shows mean, median, standard deviations, maximum, and minimum values for the full sample, while Table A.8 shows the same
statistics for the matched samples. The growth in the productivity measures is slightly
negative on average (except for labor productivity) but there is large variation across
firms as witnessed by the standard deviations. In the full sample, only about a tenth
of a percent of firms experience changes in the foreign ownership dummies while 1-2%
of firms see changes in these in the matched sample. Transitions into the foreign ownership categories are much larger than transitions out of them. In the match sample,
the average foreign ownership share is 13.7% while it is only 1.5% in the full sample.
Table A.9 shows the correlations between the growth rates of different productivity measures in the full and matched samples. The measures of (the growth rate
of) total factor productivity have correlations of 0.892 and higher in both samples
while the correlation with labor productivity (value added per worker) is lower in the
60-70% range. The correlations of total factor productivity with operating revenue
are positive but as low 41.2%; however, operating revenue per worker has a quite
different interpretation than the other measures.

Robustness We show further robustness of our results.
Table A.10 explores if the results are sensitive to how we measure “labor” and
“capital” in the productivity estimations, with the alternatives being employment/wage
bill and tangible/(tangible+intangible) fixed capital. We show results for the full sample with a continuous FDI variable and for the matched sample using the indicator for
change to foreign majority ownership. More observations are missing for employment
23
More precisely, the reported variances are of the residuals from regressing each variable on
a linearized version of the propensity score, in order to isolate the components not used in the
matching. This adjustment is recommended by Rubin (2001).

40

than for wage bill, so columns (3) and (4) show results for the sample where employment is available. The table delivers a consistent picture: the result are very robust
to the choice of labor or capital measures and to whether employment is missing in
the sample. For the full sample, the impact of an increase in foreign ownership is
significant for lags two, three, and four, which reflects that foreign acquisition in the
larger sample is compared to (in the main) no acquisition. For the matched sample which is our main focus, the effect of transition of foreign majority ownership is
robustly significant after four years, but not earlier.
Table A.11 examines robustness with respect to lag-length and examines if the
inclusion of the lagged level of productivity is important. In this table, we report
the coefficients to the lagged level of productivity and the number of foreign owners.
We estimate the relation using the change in foreign ownership allowing for three- or
five-year lags, using the matched sample.
Column (1) repeats our baseline regression (column (3) of Table 3) while column (2) drops the lagged productivity level which potentially results in omitted variable bias. Indeed, we find an insignificant estimate for the effect foreign acquisition
after four years while the first- and second-year impacts are negative and significant
at the 10% level. The lagged level of productivity is robustly estimated with a coefficient of –0.095 with sky-high levels of statistical significance. The level of initial
productivity is not typically included in existing studies, but it is well known that
foreign investors target high productivity firms and combined with mean reversion
in productivity, it is intuitive why there may be omitted variable bias affecting the
coefficients to foreign acquisition. The absence of this control may partly explain why
some previous studies found no effect of foreign acquisition.
In the specification with three lags in column (3), there is no significant effect
of foreign ownership and, in the specification with five lags in column (4), only the
lag-four coefficient is significant. The coefficients to the change in the number of
foreign owners is significant for the first and second lags at the 5% level with values
around 0.005. We do not posit hypotheses for the impact of the number of foreign
owners, but with a standard deviation of 0.25-0.35 for the number of foreign owners
41

(see Table A.8) the impact is not of much economic importance.
Table A.12 shows results for a “levels regression” with a sample split pre- and
post-the Great Recession. Using four lags, it is not attractive to use our preferred
differenced specification when we split the sample, because either the lags of the second period resides in the first period or alternatively, we lose the first four years after
the Great Recession, leaving us with too small a sample. In the first column, we show
results for the full sample. We include initial productivity times a time-trend, which
upon differencing will become initial productivity (the results are virtually unchanged
whether we use initial or lagged productivity in the differenced regressions). We prefer initial productivity to lagged productivity in this regression, in order to minimize
the endogeneity of this term (the results are similar if we instrument for it).24 The
county-sector fixed effects are also multiplied by a trend in this regression. Firm fixed
effects are included and are important in order to control for selection of more productive firms (firm fixed effects washes out in differences). The estimated coefficient
for foreign ownership is almost identical to the comparable difference specification
Table 1 in the main text (0.026 here, versus 0.027 there). Splitting the sample into
pre- and post-the-Great Recession reveals that the coefficients are very robust, 0.020
before the Great Recession and 0.017 after the Great Recession. From quick inspection of the standard errors these values are insignificantly different from each other
and from the pooled values. (The sub-period estimates are both smaller than the
pooled values but this can happen because the fitted fixed effects and trends change
values by sub-period.) In conclusion, the small effect is very robust over time.

24

A previous version of this paper us initial productivity in the differenced regressions and obtained
similar results.

Notes: The table shows the share of total output covered in by the BvD data relative to official gross output data from Eurostat, for the manufacturing
sector in our sample countries. We show the ratios in two different samples: total sample (“Total”) and TFP sample (“TFP”). The Total sample
consists of firms that report data for employment or wage bill and gross output (operating revenue), and the TFP sample consists of firms that in
addition report data on tangible fixed assets (TFAS) and materials (MATE). (For these firms we can calculate total factor productivity for these
firms). The country codes within these classifications are as follows: BE (Belgium), DE (Germany), ES (Spain), FI (Finland), FR (France), IT (Italy),
NO (Norway), and SE (Sweden). Percentages correspond to the ratio of aggregation of the output measure over all firms in the Orbis sample to the
corresponding number in the Eurostat sample. The percentages based on turnover are obtained by comparison of our data and the Eurostat SBS
data, which includes self-employed workers.

Notes: The table reports average turnover of foreign affiliates in manufacturing in billions of constant U.S. dollars with 2010 base, as reported in the OECD’s AFA and AMNE database (under
“Avg OECD turnover”) and Orbis database (under “Avg BvD turnover”). The average values are
computed for 1999-2012, by country. In line “Corr(OECD, BvD),” we report the correlations of
the annual turnover series, by country, for 1999-2012. Foreign multinational activity in the OECD
data is the sum of the multinational turnover in manufacturing reported by the AFA and AMNE
databases of the OECD. With the Orbis data, we follow the usual convention of FDI investment and
compute the multinational activity from the turnover of firms with at least 10% foreign ownership.
In panel A, we add-up the turnover of foreign-owned companies from Orbis, following our definition
of foreign-owned companies; in panel B, we add-up only a fraction of the firm turnover according to
the observed foreign ownership stakes reported by Orbis. The country abbreviations are Belgium
(BE), Germany (DE), Spain (ES), Finland (FI), France (FR), Italy (IT), Norway (NO), and Sweden
(SE).

Notes: We define foreign acquisition as the event that a foreign entity acquires any stake in a
company with no identified foreign owner before the event. Firms may experience multiple foreign
acquisitions, for example, an acquisition, divestment to domestic firm, and then acquisition by
foreigners again. The domestic acquisition is the event that a domestic investor acquires any stake
in a company where this investor was not a shareholder of this company before.
Sample cleaning steps are as follows. The starting sample (Step 0) are manufacturing firms in
our 6 countries with available financial data (pre-cleaning). In Step 1, we a) drop firms that change
4-digit sector over time; b) drop firms that in any year reported less than 10 employees; c) construct
firm age and drop firms with negative values; d) drop firm-years with zero total assets; e) drop firms
with missing output; f) clean firms that have extreme values for some important rations (if cost
of employees to tangible fixed capital (L/K)>1000 (99 percentile); if tangible fixed capital to total
assets >1; if cost of employees to value added, tangible fixed capital to value added, and tangible
fixed capital to cost of employees are greater than the 99th and less than the 1st percentile. In Step
2, the cleaning is based on M&A events.

Notes: The table reports the results of the first step in our matching procedure. The sample includes
both domestic and foreign-owned acquisitions. The dependent variable is an indicator variable of
whether the firm experienced an acquisition on that year. log TFPt−2 is the log revenue productivity
lagged two periods. ∆ log TFPt−1 and ∆ log TFPt−2 are the yearly changes in firm revenue productivity
lagged one and two periods, respectively. ∆ indicates one-year changes. log Lt−2 and log WAGEBILLt−2
represent the log of employment and the wage bill lagged two periods. log (K /L)t−2 stands for the
log of the ratio of tangible fixed assets to employment lagged two periods. log ASSETSt−2 stands for
the log of assets and log AGEt−2 for the log of firm age. *** denotes 1% significance; ** denotes 5%
significance; * denotes 10% significance.
In the matching procedure, we first estimate this logit model of the treatment indicator (foreign
acquisition) on the pre-treatment outcomes, predict the probability of acquisition (the propensity
score), and re-define the propensity score to include transformations of acquisition year, country
number, and the 2-digit sector number in order to force matching within the year-country-sector
triplets. Finally, we match the firms using this new propensity score (using the psmatch2 routine in
Stata) with replacement and impose a common support. In the baseline implementation, for each
treated company, we keep the two closest matched controls and use a 0.2 caliper of the propensity
score.

Notes: The sample includes domestic and foreign acquisitions. “U” stands for “Unmatched” while “M” stands for “Matched”. log TFPt−2 is the log
revenue productivity lagged two periods. ∆ log TFPt−1 and ∆ log TFPt−2 are the yearly changes in firm revenue productivity lagged one and two
periods, respectively. ∆ indicates one-year changes. log Lt−2 and log WAGEBILLt−2 are the logarithms of employment and wage bill lagged two periods.
log (K /L)t−2 stands for the log of the ratio of tangible fixed assets to employment lagged two periods. log ASSETSt−2 stands for the log of assets and
log AGEt−2 for the log of firm age. The standardized % bias is the % difference of the sample means in the treated and non-treated (full or matched)
sub-samples as a percentage of the square root of the average of the sample variances in the treated and non-treated groups. Ve (T )/Ve (C) is the ratio
of the variance of the residuals orthogonal to the linear index of the propensity score in the treated group (foreign-acquired) over the non-treated group
(domestic-acquired) for each covariate. This ratio should equal 1 if there is perfect balance. Following common usage, one asterisk (*) is displayed
for variables with ratios in the intervals [0.5, 0.8) or (1.25, 2].

Notes: ∆ log refers to one year log changes. ∆ indicates one-year changes. TFPWLP is total factor
productivity from a Cobb-Douglas (CD) production function estimated following Wooldridge (2009)
by country-sector. TFPACF is total factor productivity from CD production function estimated following Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015) by country-sector. TFPACFTL is total factor productivity
from a translog (TL) production function estimated following Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015)
by sector. LPVA is labor productivity (LP) measured as value added over number of employees.
LPY is labor productivity (LP) measured as output over number of employees. ∆ log(FO) is the
yearly change in the log(FO + 1) where FO stands for the percentage of foreign ownership divided by
100. DFOmaj + is a dummy variable that equals one if the firm went from minority or domestically
owned to majority owned (majority refers more 50% ownership). DFOmaj − is a dummy variable that
equals one if the firm went from foreign majority ownership to minority or domestic ownership.
Nr For Owners stands for the number of foreign owners.

Notes: The dependent variable is the change in log revenue firm-level total productivity at time t
(∆ log TFPi,t ). ∆ indicates one-year changes. Column (1) shows our baseline results where TFP is
estimated using wage bill as the measure of labor and tangible fixed assets for capital. Columns (2)
and (3) show results for TFP estimated using wage bill as a measure of for labor. In column (2) TFP
is estimated using the sum of tangible and intangible fixed assets for capital. Column (3) uses the
same measure of TFP as used in column (1) but for the sample of firms reporting employment. In
column (4), the dependent variable is TFP is estimated using employment as the measure of labor
and tangible fixed assets as the measure of capital. Panel A reports our main results for the total
sample of firms, while Panel B reports results for the matched sample of firms. ∆ log(FO) is the
yearly change in the log(FO + 1) where FO is the percentage of foreign ownership. DFOmaj + is a
dummy variable that equals one if the firm went from minority or domestically owned to majority
owned ( majority refers to more than 50% ownership). Standard errors are clustered at the firm level.
Results are obtained by a weighted (GLS) regression where the weights are the square roots of each
firm’s mean squared predicted residuals from an initial OLS estimation. All specifications include
the lag one, two, three, and four change in number of owners and lag one log firm productivity. ***

Notes: The dependent variable is log revenue firm-level productivity at time t. The main regressor
is log(FO + 1) where FO is the percentage of foreign ownership, Nr For Owners is the number of foreign
owners in the firm, and log TFP1 is productivity of the firm the first year the firms is in the regression
sample. FIRM TREND is the number of years since firm i was first observed in the data in the given
time sub-sample (all years, up to and including 2007, starting from 2008); i.e., it equals unity the
first time we observe the firm in the sub-sample, regardless of the actual calendar year. Standard
errors are clustered at the firm level. Results are obtained by GLS estimation using as weights the
square root of each firm’s mean squared predicted residuals from an initial OLS estimation. ***
denotes 1% significance; ** denotes 5% significance; * denotes 10% significance.
