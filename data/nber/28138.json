    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine how 17 behavioral biases relate to each other, to other decision inputs, and to decision outputs. Most consumers exhibit multiple biases in our nationally representative panel data. There is substantial heterogeneity across consumers, even within similar demographic/skill groups. Biases are positively correlated within person, especially after adjusting for measurement error, and less correlated with other inputs\u2014risk aversion, patience, cognitive skills, and personality traits\u2014with some expected exceptions. Accounting for this correlation structure, we reduce our 29 decision inputs to eight common factors. Seven common factors load on at least two biases, six on clusters of theoretically related biases, and two or three are distinctly behavioral. All but one common factor is distinct from cognitive skills. Factor scores strongly conditionally correlate with decisions and outcomes in various domains. We discuss several potential implications of this taxonomy for various approaches to modeling influences of behavioral biases on decision making.\n\n",

We thank Shachar Kariv and Dan Silverman for helping us implement their (with Choi and Muller) interface for measuring choice consistency, Charlie Sprenger for help with choosing the certainty premium elicitation tasks and with adapting the convex time budget tasks, Georg Weizsacker for help in adapting one of the questions we use to measure narrow bracketing, Julian Jamison for advice on measuring ambiguity aversion, Josh Schwartzstein for many conversations, and Doug Staiger and Erik Snowberg for advice re: measurement error.
