International

Trade, Indebtedness,
and Welfare Repercussions
Among Supply—Constrained
Economies under Floating
Exchange Rates

ABSTRACT
Almost all developed economies at some time during the 1970s seemed
supply—constrained. Even much of measured excess capacity was arguably
redundant due to energy price shocks, environmental policy, and other structural flux of the 1970s. Little analytical work has been carried out on the
macroeconomics of open economies under such supply constraints. This paper
attempts a beginning. Its focus is on the international transmission of
various macroeconomic shocks, and on their implications for the current
account, capital account, and exchange rate. The paper captures both the
foreign repercussions and the terms—of—trade effects of various shocks.
Conclusions are based on an analytical model that assigns behavior to
each of two regions relating to one nontradeable input, one tradeable output,
and one tradeable financial asset. International exchange between the two
regions is characterized by sequential "temporary equilibria," each consistent with economically and institutionally constrained optimization, yet
each simultaneously consistent with failure of output and input markets to
clear. International transactions take place in capital markets and through
a foreign exchange market that do clear continuously through flexible exchange
rates.

The abstract reduced form of the model is derived, then applied empirically,
using parameters and initial values that incorporate data and consensus beliefs
about the U.S. and the rest of the world in the 1970s. The most important
conclusions of the exercise are:

(1) Floating exchange rates fail to insulate either supply—constrained
economy from unanticipated shocks in the other. International transmission
is direct —— the impacts on the two regions of any shock have the same sign.
(2)

Exchange rates and the terms of trade between the supply—constrained

economies are moderately sensitive to incomes policies and changes in technology!
productivity trends (elasticities of 0.5 to 1.5 in absolute value) and relatively
insensitive to fiscal policy and distributionally neutral wage—price guidelines.
Wage—favoring incomes policies, liquidity—financed fiscal expansion, tighter
wage—price guidelines, and slackening of technology/productivity growth all cause
depreciation of the domestic currency and deterioriatlon of the terms of trade.
(3)

These same shocks all promote "internationalization" of commodity

and financial markets. Export volume, import volume, claims on foreigners,

and indebtedness to them all grow as a result, sometimes by significant
amounts (elasticities as high as 1.5 in response to each shock taken independently of the others, and larger elasticities in response to combinations
of shocks).

I. INTRODUCTION

The analytical foundation of traditional international macroeconomics
has been as shaken by recent events as that of closed—economy macroeconomics.
Its usefulness has been clouded by enduring stagflation, globally parallel

declines in capital formation and productivity trends, synchronous cyclical
movements even under floating exchange rates, and puzzling volatility and
unpredictability of exchange rates.

One of several problems with traditional international macroeconomics
is that it often supposes stylized equilibrium states of the world, with

thoroughgoing market—clearing. Yet its concerns have much more the flavor
of "disequilibrium" states of the world, especially during the past fifteen
years, with measures of excess capacity, unemployment, inflationary gaps,
labor shortages, and current—account flux suggesting enduring excess supply
or demand.

A "disequilibrium" characterization seems especially appropriate to
the recurrent global overheating in the 197 Os, coupled with widespread

recourse to wage—price guidelines and incomes policies. To the extent that
such policies were successful (President Carter's were enforced by Federal
purchasing threats, for example), output markets have been frequently supply—
constrained (with transactions rationed or deferred), and input markets have
featured unemployment or shortages depending on whether incomes policies
over— or undervalued factors of production.
During the late 1970s, almost all developed economies seemed supply—

constrained. Even much of measured excess capacity was arguably redundant

12

due to energy price shocks, environmental policy, and other structural flux

of the 1970s. In the U.S., labor markets seemed

similarly supply—constrained

even in the presence of unprecedented unemployment, because of the large
number of job—seekers who were "structurally unemployed" ——

possessing skills

or preferences that made them a non—competing group for vacant positions at

ruling wages. In European labor markets, by contrast, excess supply seemed
more aptly to characterize the l970s, given the rapid 1972—74 run—up in real
wages that was preserved by inertia and indexation (International

Monetary

Fund (1980), Chapter 1).

Little analytical work has been carried out on the macroeconomics of

open economies under such constraints, despite the intriguing
correlation of widespread wage—price guidelines, exchange—rate volatility,
and the explosion of international trade and investment relative to other

economic activity in the early 1970s. This paper attempts a beginning..
Its focus is on transmission of various macroeconomic shocks between

output—

supply...constrajnd economies and on their implications for the current account,

capital account, and exchange rate. For empirical relevance the paper
abandons the small—country and fixed—exchange—rate assumptions that have

characterized antecedent related research.1 Unlike the latter, the
analysis in this paper treats both the foreign repercussions and the terms—
of—trade effects of various shocks.

Section II of the paper describes an analytical model that assigns
behavior to each of two regions relating to one nontradeable input, one

tradeable output, and one tradeable financial asset. International exchange

13

between the two regions is characterized by sequential "temporary equilibria,"
each consistent with economically and institutionally constrained optimization, yet each simultaneously consistent with failure of some markets to

clear. International transactions take place through a foreign exchange
market that does clear continuously through flexible exchange rates.
Section III and the Appendices describe the reduced form of the model
and apply it empirically, using parameters and initial values that incorporate
data and consensus beliefs about the U.S. and the rest of the world in the

late 1970s. The most important conclusions of the exercise are:
(1) Floating exchange rates fail to insulate either supply—constrained
economy from unanticipated shocks in the other. Their international
transmission is direct ——

the impacts of any shock on the two regions

are qualitatively similar. Cross—region spillover effects are, however,
quantitatively small relative to the own—region effects.

(2) Exchange rates and the terms of trade between the Supply—constrained
economies are moderately sensitive to incomes policies and changes in technology!
productivity trends (elasticities of 0.5 to 1.5 in absolute value).

They are

relatively insensitive to fiscal policy and to distributionally neutral wage—

price guidelines (elasticities of 0.0 to 0.2

except that the terms of trade

are moderately sensitive to the wage—price guidelines).

Wage—favoring incomes

policies, liquidity—financed fiscal expansion, tighter wage—price guidelines, and slackening of technology/productivity growth all cause depreciation of the domestic currency and deterioration of the terms of trade.

(3) One percent changes in incomes policies and technology/productivity
trends in the supply—constrained economies have quantitative impacts on all

14

variables that are generally 3 to 5 times the impact of one percent changes
in government spending or in distributionally

neutral wage—price guidelines.

(4) Wage—favoring incomes policies, liquidity—based fiscal expansion,
tighter wage—price guidelines, and slackening of technology/productivity
growth all promote "internationalizatio&' of commodity and financial markets.

Export volume, import volume, claims on foreigners, and indebtedness to them
can grow significantly in response to each (elasticities up to 1,5), and
especially so in response to several taken together.

II. AN ABSTRACT MODEL

The abstract model that we work with is a structurally symmetric
generalization of Malinvaud (1977). Malinvaud explores a closed economy
with one input (labor), one output (goods), and one asset (money, also the

numeraire). His focus is on the temporary equilibrium attained when
economic agents optimize subject to quantity constraints consistent with
sluggish prices and the absence of barter.

Our model posits for each economy one input (with others,
entrepreneurship and fixed physical capital, implied), one output,
one asset (liquid wealth or money), each unique to that economy. Input
markets are bounded by national borders; output markets and asset—holding

span them. All international transactions are financed through a foreign
exchange market with a potentially flexible exchange rate. The model pushes
beyond other "internationalizations" of Malinvaud's model by Dixit (1978)

and Neary (1979): (i) by eschewing their small—country assumption (which
allows them to ignore the terms of trade and foreign repercussions that are
an important focus of our work, and to lump exportables and importables into
one aggregate "commodity"); and (ii) by analyzing floating in the foreign
exchange market in addition to their fixed—exchange—rate regimes.
Each of the two trading economies is subject to potential price sluggishness or government policies that cause output and input markets to clear
only slowly compared to foreign—exchange and financial capital "markets".
When this happens, the short side of the input or output market rules, in
the sense that the volume of transactions carried out matches the smaller

of supply and demand. Frustrated sellers or buyers on the

11—2

long side of such markets are induced by their rationing there to alter
their demands for and supplies of different goods elsewhere, alterations

that are referred to as "spillover effects."
Each economy is populated by three groups of agents: households, firms,
and government. Households and firms act as price—takers, although the
economy as a whole (being large) influences the world price for the unique

commodity it produces. The foreign currency price of each country's output
is flexible to the extent that the exchange rate is.2 Governments have
the capacity to alter prices and wages by legislative decree. Expectations
of future prices and wages are formed taking this into account, but only
unanticipated shocks are examined below.

Households are buyers in two markets, for the outputs of firms in

both countries. They are sellers in one market, for inputs to domestic
firms. The only such input is labor services, the supply of which is fixed

exogenously. Households may be constrained in any of these markets in
principle, as buyers of either good or as sellers of labor. If rationed
as buyers in a product market, households will tend to increase demands in

other markets. If rationed as sellers in the labor market, i.e., if unemployed, households will tend to reduce demands in other markets. These

are spillover effects of rationing. Households hold liquid financial claims
denominated in both domestic and foreign currencies. If such claims pay
interest, the interest rate is taken to be invariant given the assumptions
of stable wage—price trajectories and a fixed physical capital stock mentioned

above. These claims are the means of transferring purchasing power to
the future. Households are never rationed in their acquisition of liquid
assets, making them and whatever deferred purchases they represent a sink

11—3

for current spillover effects.

Firms are sellers in one market, selling their (domestic) output to
households in both countries and to the domestic government, and buyers in

one market, purchasing only domestic labor services. Firms may be rationed
as buyers of labor, in which case their output will be less than they would
like, or as sellers of output, in which case the spillover effect is a

reduction in their demand for labor services. Firms hold domestic
financial claims in an amount equal to current profits
(the reward to the implied factors, entrepreneurship and fixed
capital), which are then fully distributed to household—shareholders in the
subsequent period (see below).

Governments purchase domestic output only (government imports are

neglected), and are never rationed. They finance their purchases by
creating new domestic money or other liquid assets. Taxes and transfers
(including any interest payments on liquid debt) are assumed to balance.

The optimizing behavior of the three groups of agents is expressed in
algebraic detail as follows:

Households: Households maximize utility that is defined over current
and future3 consumption of commodities.

When households are not rationed in any market, the maximization is

Households may be rationed in principle as buyers of country l's commodity,

or of country 2's commodity, or of both. Excess demand then exists in
commodity markets. In these cases, household maximization is further
constrained in that consumption cannot exceed available supplies:4

When firms are rationed as buyers of labor services, excess demand and

labor shortages characterize labor markets, and N (the labor force)

replaces N (employment) in (5). When firms are rationed as sellers of
commodities, incipient excess supply characterizes output markets. Optimizing firms will produce only what they can sell (X.. + X.. + C1,

financial market that is the locus for trade between the two countries'

familiar requirement that variation in the exchange rate brings about budget—

III. AN APPLICATION TO A U.S./REST—OF-WORLD
REGIME OF BINDING OUTPUT SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS

As outlined in the introduction, the model of Section II can be
usefully applied to global settings of recent vintage (the 1970s), that

may also characterize the near future. "Supply constrained" economies
are those with measured and "repressed" inflation (Malinvaud (1977)) in
markets for their output, where the elements repressing inflation, i.e.,
rationing or deferring demand, might include contractual sluggishness and

any price guidelines or incomes policies of a central government. These
same elements plus explicit wage guidelines might lead labor markets to
be similarly supply—constrained, but can conceivably cause excess supply as
well, for which case the label "classical unemployment" is usually applied
(Malinvaud (1977)), and Europe in the 1970s cited as an example.
In this setting both commodity and factor markets will fail to clear,

the first being characterized by excess demand, and the second by either

excess supply or demand. All these excesses will spill over into markets
that are not subject to rationing. These will include financial and
foreign exchange markets that seem realistically to clear continuously.

Spillovers into financial markets are more accurately thought of as
spillovers into future purchases, one counterpart to deferred purchases
in current periods.

Since price controls and guidelines are not traditionally applied
to exports and imports, excess commodity demand domestically will also
spill over into current imports, a spillover that will be accommodated
readily by foreign suppliers who are not constrained in export sales and

111—2

pricing. Thus although domestic buyers may find themselves rationed,

foreign buyers (importers) will not. This last phenomenon has the
potential to create infinitely profitable arbitrage, since the prices
that suppliers receive on foreign sales can rise relative to those they

are allowed on domestic sales. But since export markets for most suppliers
are usually smaller than domestic markets, modest reallocations of sales
toward exports will generally be sufficient to reduce the export price to
its traditional relationship to domestic price,7 and the arbitrage

opportunity will be eliminated. This elimination of infinite arbitrage
profits should be immediate and continuous, even when overall markets

do not clear. (Suppliers will, of course, make profits on infra—marginal
sales adjustments due to arbitrage, thus justifying the arbitrage.)

There is more than a suggestion in this discussion that supply—
constrained regimes may be afflicted with volatile responses of exports,
imports, capital movements, and exchange rates to wage—price guidelines

and other familiar policies. And indeed the potential for volatile international transactions and exchange rates can be confirmed in the abstract

using the appropriate version of the model of Section II. But any such
demonstration is worthless if these spillovers could not even in principle

be quantitatively important determinants of observed volatility. Empirically sensible measures of their impact are not immediately clear.
To address both the empirical and the abstract concerns, we describe
below the results from investigating a "central—value version" of Section

II's model. Parameter values were chosen "centrally" in the sense that

111—3

they reflect well—established empirical regularities: approximate medium—
term invariance of budget and factor shares to most changes, and the
tendency of estimated own—price and income elasticities of demand to center

(in absolute value) around one. Log—linear utility and production functions
yield precisely these properties, and, as side benefits, both empirical
8

measurability (shares) and analytical tractability:

V1(X11, X21, M1, M21) = v1

as the specific forms of V1( )

be considered, where a's, s's, and '"s

(10)

log Y. =

log

a. + 5.

log

N

as the specific form of (5), where 6. denotes a factor share and a1
denotes a constant.

Maximization subject to the constraints that characterize supply—
constrained economies as described above, in which all consumers are
rationed, yet only in their respective domestic markets, yields the

following system of equations. For country l's commodity exports and imports (2's imports and exports, respectively), effective demands are:

p1X12 =

p2X21 =

Cr)

(w2N2 +

(l/r) (w1N1 +

+ N°2/r ÷

-

p2C22);

+ rM1 - p1C11).

Spillover effects on trade as a result of domestic rationing are
reflected in the first and last terms on the right—hand side of (11).

If

wages and prices could vary to clear markets, then the denominators l_2
and 1—a2 would be replaced by 1, and the pVC.. terms would vanish.
Unrationed international commodity trade in turn feeds back on domestic output
rationing, as reflected in the last term of the domestic demand equations,
given the assumed constraints:

C..
=Y.
—G
—x

This sets commodity trade apart from international capital movements, which
are subject to spillover influences from domestic output rationing, but do

not feed back on It. Net international claims (stocks) are given by:

M12 =

(13.2)

M21 =

(f') (l/r)

(w1N1 + +

+ M2/r + M2 - p2C22);
+ rM1 -

p1C11).

The exchange rate is sensitive to the spillover effects of domestic rationing on trade and capital movements, as well as reflecting its standard role
in valuing relative asset stocks (implicit in the

below):

In the absence of rationing and spillovers, the exchange rate would reflect
only the relative nominal output trends and valuation of national financial
asset stocks, in a manner familiar from the monetary/portfolio approach to

floating exchange rates)°
Wages (w.), prices

government spending (p1G.), and beginning—of—

period values (superscript o) are exogenously fixed by assumption. When
firms are rationed in the labor market (repressed inflation), then einpioy—

ment (N.) and output supply (Y.) are fixed by the exogenous labor force

Ci) and by the rule that quantities are dictated by the short side of the
market. When households are rationed in the labor market (classical unemployment), then employment and output vary as determined by the production

function and the labor demand curve implied by profit maximization. In
any event, other variables that are determined endogenously and simultaneously
by the system include commodity trade (X12, X21), rationed domestic purchases
(C11, C22), international financial claims (M12, M21) and the exchange rate
12
(r).

The simultaneity of the system would be reduced in a fixed exchange—rate
regime, as discussed in Appendix A.

Reduced—form equivalents of (11) through

(14) are derived in Appendix B. Empirical approximations to the reduced form
of (l1)—(l4) are calculated

111—6

in Appendi,c C. Parameters and initial values were chosen to create a
stylized but "central—value" representation of the U.S. and the rest of
the world in the late 1970s.

The discussion below is based on this

empirically stylized reduced form, the elements of which are summarized
in Table 1.

The multipliers of exogenous variables on endogenous are displayed

in elasticity form in Table 2. The table is divided, the left—hand side
recording the impact of shocks in country 1, the "stylized U.S.," and the
right—hand side recording those in country 2, the "stylized rest—of—the—

world."3 Each column on each side represents a different experiment:
Columns labelled "—w.,p" display the impacts of an unanticipated one
percent tightening of wage/price guidelines in some overall price controls
program.

Columns labelled "WI" display the impacts of an unanticipated incomes
policy that favors labor by one percent (specifically a policy that allows

wages to rise one percent faster than prices).14 Without intending to
prejudice we will occasionally refer to such policies below as "progressive"
incomes policies.
Columns labelled "a11' display the impacts of an unanticipated one
15
percent increase in growth due to disembodied technological progress.

Columns labelled "gj" display the impacts of unanticipated one—percent
fiscal expansion, financed either by monetization or by borrowing in liquid
financial instruments (see equation (7)).

The impact of one percent looser price
guidelines, with no change in wage
guidelines (dp1/p1 = 0.01),
can be obtained by adding the entries in the
column to those in the
WI column, then reversing the sign. These results would
represent the Impacts from an unanticipated
incomes policy within wage—price
guidelines that favored "capital" instead of labor. For the parameters
the table (specifically
underlying
0.757), a one percent increase in price with no change
61
in wage represents an increase In returns to "capital" of 4.12
percent.
**
For every experiment except those in the w.
columns, there are no employment
(N1) or output (Y1) effects even when households are rationed in labor markets, so
that firms are on their labor demand
curves, and employment is negatively responsive
to the real wage
(wi/pi). This is because neither equiproportjonai
wage—price
guidelines (—w1,p1), technological improvement (a1), nor fiscal policy
(g1),
alters the real wage
(w1/p.). w1 policy, by contrast, does, and hence causes N1
and
to fall when there is excess
supply in labor markets (not otherwise). One
percent looser wage guidelines in either
region, for given price guidelines
(dw./w. = 0.01)
causes employment to fall (and unemployment to rise) 4.12 percent,
and causes output to fall 3.12
percent. Such employment_output adjustments do not
alter the elasticites recorded in the
w1 columns, except in the case of Ci., for
reasons outlined In Appendix C.
These entries are appropriate only to the case of supply constraint (excess
demand) in the labor market. When,
by contrast, households are rationed in the
labor market and firms are on their labor demand curves, the
appropriate entries
are: for C11, —4.55 for C22, —4.22

111—11

It is an interesting property of the log—linear utility and production
functions employed to establish central values that the results of Table 2
are, with two exceptions, invariant to whether the labor market features

excess demand or excess supply. In the former case, employment (N1) and
output (Y.) are unaffected by any of the shocks (being fixed at

and

in the latter, both respond negatively to an increased wage (w1),

but in a quantitatively offsetting way.'6
Table 2 reveals the following conclusions:

(1) Cleanly floating exchange rates do not insulate either supply—

constrained region from shocks in the other. They would have done so only
if financial claims on foreigners and indebtedness to them had been zero.
With positive international claims and indebtedness, each exogenous change
causes exchange—rate—related capital gains and losses on national portfolios
that alter real demands for goods and assets.

(2) The international transmission of shocks between supply—constrained

regimes under floating exchange rates is direct. Each policy, and productivity—
based growth as well, generates an effect abroad that is qualitatively sim-

ilar to that at home. Additional rationing at home causes increased spillover
purchases of unconstrained imports from foreign producers (at flexible prices)

and these ration out additional foreign buyers. In symmetric fashion, relief
from domestic rationing creates repercussions abroad that relieve foreign

rationing as well. Such "rationing repercussions" increase the sensitivity
of domestic shortages to any given domestic policy or change.

(3) The quantitative size of this international transmission is important
only for real welfare (national purchasing power).

Otherwise, own—country

influences are generally 3 to 40 times larger than cross—country influences)7

The results provide little practical support for international policy
coordination that is rooted in avoiding the import of foreign vice (e.g.

111—12

imported rationing and inflationary pressure) or In encouraging the import
of foreign virtue (e.g. locomotive or convoy approaches).

(4) The quantitative impacts of what might be loosely called "supply—
side" policies —— towards factor shares (w. columns) and growth (a
columns) ——

are,

with a few exceptions, from 3 to 5 times larger than the

quantitative impacts of more traditional wage—price controls (—w.,p.) and
fiscal initiatives (g.).

(5) Distributionally neutral wage—price guidelines, "progressive" (in
the sense of favoring wages) incomes policies, and liquidity—based fiscal

expansion all have qualitatively similar effects. All such policies weaken
a nation's currency in the foreign exchange market, with consequent terms—
of—trade deterioration and a decline in its standard of living (as measured

by national purchasing power). (The impacts on real national welfare are,
however, quantitatively small.) Technology—based output growth, by contrast,
strengthens a nation's currency, improves its terms of trade and standard
of living, and loosens up the ration that constrains domestic purchasers,

thereby reducing shortages and order backlogs.18 Under fixed exchange rates
the national welfare effects of these policies are hidden in official—
reserve changes, as Appendix A implies.

(6) Tighter wage—price controls, more "progressive" incomes policies,
and fiscal expansion all ration domestic consumers more tightly (reduce

as one would expect. And...
(7) ...frustrated purchasing power spills over toward unconstrained
imports of commodities (rp2X21 for 1; p1X12/r for 2) and toward claims on
future commodities (M11 and rM21 for 1; N22 and M12/r for 2);
(8)

...

such international spillovers of purchasing power cause

111—13

exchange—rate depreciation that, in turn, causes
(9)

.

. .real

exports of both commodities and ownership of domestic

assets (X1 and M. stocks for country i) to vary positively with wage—price
controls, "progressive" incomes policies, and fiscal expansion, counter to
casual intuition, but consistent with the remarkable burgeoning of export
volume and international liabilities during the inflation—prone early l970s
in which each of these policies enjoyed some unanticipated prominence.
(10) Finally, because these policies cause spillover increases in
imports and claims on foreigners, as well as exports and liabilities to
them,19 they could all be characterized as increasing the "internationalization" of commodity and financial capital markets, in a way that again
seems consistent with observation in the 1970s.

(1l)—(15) Conversely to (6)—(10), technological progress, productivity
growth, and supply expansion shrink supply constraints and rationing
dramatically, leading to currency appreciation, larger imports
and exports, symmetric changes in international asset positions, and
declining "internationalization" of world commodity and asset markets.

APPENDIX A
REDUCED FORM OF AND CONCLUSIONS
FROM MODEL UNDER FIXED
EXCHANGE RATES

If the exchange rates were fixed between two supply—constrained
economies as described in the text, then equations (1l)—(13) could describe
them, with (14) being overruled by the authorities' exchange—rate target,

enforced by the requisite foreign—exchange—market intervention. The
reduced form of the system is recorded below, and is established by solving
(11) and (12) simultaneously for X12, X21, C11, and C22, then using these
solution values to solve (13) recursively for M12 and

Table Al records selected results from a "central—value" version of

equations (llA)_(l3A),A2 where the parameters underlying the calculations
are those described in Table 1 of the text and in Appendix C. Table Al is
directly comparable to Table 2 of the text, the former giving results under
rigidly fixed exchange rates and the latter under cleanly floating exchange
rates.

The conclusions from Table A2 are qualitatively the same as those

from Table 2. Even the absolute size of the quantitative differences is
not great, suggesting that supply—constrained economies as large and
"closed" as these do not respond very differently to unanticipated shocks

from exchange—rate system to exchange—rate system. Two differences are
notable, however, and are summarized in the following:

(1) Floating exchange rates do provide a measure of insulation. Under
floating, domestic shortages and rationing are less affected by foreign
influences than under fixed exchange rates.

(2) Under floating exchange rates, wage—price guidelines, incomes
policy, growth/technology flux, and fiscal/monetary initiatives all have
less pronounced effects on imports of goods and ownership of assets, and

more pronounced effects on exports of goods and ownership of assets than

under fixed exchange rates. Exchange rate adjustment wipes out a large
portion of the import effect and creates most of the export effect.

floating exchange rates would guarantee insulation: X12, C11, and

H12 would depend on the country 1 variables in Z1 alone, and not on

X21, C22, and

would depend on Z2 alone, and not on Z1. A peculiarity

of such insulation would be that each supply—constrained region could
independently influence its real exports and the domestic—currency value of
its liabilities to foreigners, but would have no ability to influence its
real imports or the foreign—currency value of its claims on foreigners.

3Financial assets are the means by which consumption can be transferred between the present and the future. Current household stocks of
assets thus vary directly, ceteris paribus, with intended future consumption, and can be taken to represent it. That is one reason why they appear
in the household utility function. Another is any intrinsic "utility value"
that they may have. Expectations are, as mentioned, assumed to be stable
because of our principal focus in this paper on shocks that are difficult
or impossible to anticipate.
4When both countries' households are rationed in either goods market,
then rationing rules must be defined to allocate available supplies (Y1 —

G1)
between domestic and foreign buyers. Such rationing rules further constrain
the household maximization process. For examples: (i) ration according to

5lnstantaneous clearing In the foreign exchange market remains characteristic even under "fixed" exchange rates and managed floating, once account is
taken of both private (firm and household) and official (government) supplies
and demands. Excess private supply of or demand for foreign exchange still
exist in this case, however, and hence a "balance of payments" can be defined.
But the exchange rate is nevertheless flexible, and responsive to both government intervention and private action.
6This can be seen by summing the household and government budget constraints ((2) and (7)), adding and subtracting exports of goods (p1X12 if
unconstrained) and rearranging the result in order to apply the sub'stitution

7mere are many reasons why export prices will differ in equilibrium
from domestic prices, including taxes, transport costs, and price discrimination (Kravis and Lipsey (1971, 1977)). The text describes how price
controls and extraordinary sluggishness can cause the actual wedge between
export and domestic prices to diverge temporarily from the equilibrium
wedge, creating supplier arbitrage that restores the equilibrium wedge.
Note that this would imply that uncontrolled export prices would change
at the same rate as domestic prices subject to control. In the U.S.,
between 1971 and mid—1980, the ratio of U.S. export unit values to wholesale prices rose at an average annual rate of only 0.7 percent per year
(International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics).
8The use of specific and empirically plausible functions in this way
has illustrative precedent as a means of easing computational burdens and
alleviating indeterminacy in both the disequilibrium—macroeconomics literature (Malinvaud (1977), Muellbauer and Portes (1978, Appendix), Ito (1978))
and in the exchange rate—dynamics literature (Dornbusch (1976), Flood (1979)).

(i4) is obtained by substituting (11) and (13) into (8) and partially
for r —— "partially solving" in the sense that r remains on the

right—hand side of (14) as well, in both numerator and denominator.
10This can be seen in (14) by observing that the

without rationing, and the w1N's could be rewritten is nominal output
(p.Y.) less current profits, where current profits are exactly equal to

firms' stocks of financial assets. See equation (j) nd oQtnQte 6 abQve.
11We do not highlight these for reasons cited in footnote 12. But
they are easily calculated — see note** to Table 2.
12We have ignored certain other endogenous variables, such as domestic
asset stocks (M11, M22) and measures of the "inflationary gap" because of

the international focus of our paper. They are easily examined, however,
using the results from Table 2, because they are recursively determined
with respect to the impacts recorded there. They, too, are influenced
fundamentally by spillovers, even with respect to their functional determinants, making conclusions that rely on "stable" behavior (e.g., the
demand for cash balances or the Phillips curve) doubtful at best. Each
country's aggregate "inflationary gap" or "shortage" (D1,D2) would be
best measured by the excess of notional demand facing its domestic
producers over available supply:

It is worth noting the implicit international interdependence of inflationary

be reflected in D1). International transmission of rationing, gaps, and
shortages is discussed below and in Appendix A.

13Comparisons of the left—hand side results to their counterparts on the
right—hand side provide an elementary sensitivity analysis for the calculations. All of the results are quantitatively robust to the one change in
parameters implicit in focussing on one region compared to the other. The
(i) the U.S. is wealthier
two stylized regions are asymmetric in that:
relative to its income than the rest of the world (about 20% better endowed
with liquid wealth relative to income); (ii) the U.S. is more "open" than the
rest of the world taken together (trade is about 10 percent of output, rather
than 5 percent; liquid liabilities to foreigners are around 9 percent of
liquid wealth, rather than 4 percent); and (iii) the U.S. is a net debtor
on liquidity account (net international indebtedness equal to roughly 2 percent of liquid wealth) whereas the rest of the world is a net creditor (net
claims on the U.S. equal to roughly 1 percent of rest—of—world liquid wealth).

14Note * to Table 2 describes the way to determine the impacts of an
incomes policy that favors profits.

15The impacts of a guidelines program that allowed permissible wage
increases to exceed permissible price increases by the amount that productivity increases exceeded a critical value (maybe zero) can be calculated
by adding the entries in the "w" column to those in the "a1" column. It

will be observed that this kind of productivity—conditioned incomes policy
has qualitatively opposite effects to unconditional incomes policies that
favor wages.
16See Appendix C below and note **

to

Table 2.

17This conclusion has nothing to do with "small—country effects." The
two regions are in ratio roughly 1:2 in size. See footnote 13.
18The effect of a region's output growth on its inflationary gap (D.

from footnote 12) is negative and substantial ——
of 15 or so in absolute value.

on asset stocks rather than asset flows. It is worth noting that
all shocks cause real commodity exports (X.. for country i) to move
parallel with commodity imports (X,. for country i), and also to move
parallel with stocks of liabilities to foreigners

which themselves

move parallel with the stock of claims on foreigners (M21). This seems
to suggest the possibility of simultaneous surpluses (or deficits) on both
"real" current account and capital account. Such "real" changes are of
course consistent with cleanly floating exchange rates, and are actually
accommodated by them to bring about market—clearing in the foreign exchange
market through re—valuation of commodity trade and through capital gains or
losses on existing portfolio positions (M2 and

FOOTNOTES TO APPENDIX A

Alintervention in the foreign exchange market (purchases of or
sales from official currency hoards) would necessarily alter stocks of
liquidity available to the public, and would have to be added to or subtracted from the right—hand side of equation (8) (the government's budget
constraint). Official—reserve transactions with the public would also
provide a sink for any excess stock supply/demand of liquidity, additional
to those discussed in footnote 6.
A2Table Al records only elasticities of

X12, X21, M12, M21, C11, and
C22 with respect to various shocks. These are all "real" magnitudes. The

corresponding elasticities for domestic—currency values of the same variables
are either identical or differ numerically by 1. The corresponding elasticities for foreign—currency values are, under fixed exchange rates, equal to
those for domestic—currency values. Terms—of—trade and welfare effects are
not immediately relevant under fixed exchange rates, since current— and
capital—account changes are financed out of official reserves (although one
might attach welfare significance to such changes in reserves, and reserve
losses may just postpone the exchange—rate, terms—of—trade and welfare
effects described in Table 2 of the text).

Measures of liquid wealth were chosen because of the belief that it,
rather than illiquid wealth, would be the sink for spillover effects due
to temporary non—market—clearing. For the same reason, only it appears
explicitly in household budget constraints (equations (2) of the text),
and as an influence on the exchange rate (equation (8) of the text).

c3m15 proportion may seem unduly large, since given log—linear utility
functions (unit—price—elastic demand functions), and given repressed
inflation and the fixed output supply (Y1) that would accompany excess demand

in the labor market, 6 percent gaps would correspond to sluggish or controlled prices that were roughly 6 percent below market—clearing levels.
Given classical unemployment, however, with excess supply in the labor market
and output supply elasticities of roughly 3 (S/(l_6), as shown below) with
respect to price, 6 percent gaps would correspond to holding prices only 1.5
percent below market—clearing levels. ?thd in any event: (1) outright
shortages represent only a fraction of inflationary gaps, the remainder
being accounted for by delivery delays; (ii) shortfalls of current production over "normal" demand may be considerably smaller than 6 percent,
which is a proportion that is mushroomed by previous periods' accumulated
shortages, deferred purchases, and spillover effects.
