Noncontractible Investments and Reference Points
Oliver D. Hart
NBER Working Paper No. 16929
April 2011
JEL No. D23,D86,K12
ABSTRACT
We analyze noncontractible investments in a model with shading. A seller can make an investment
that affects a buyer’s value. The parties have outside options that depend on asset ownership. When
shading is not possible and there is no contract renegotiation, an optimum can be achieved by giving
the seller the right to make a takeitorleaveit offer. However, with shading, such a contract creates
deadweight losses. We show that an optimal contract will limit the seller’s offers, and possibly create
ex post inefficiency. Asset ownership can improve matters even if revelation mechanisms are allowed.

1.Introduction
In the last twenty five years or so a formal literature on asset ownership and firm boundaries—
known as property rights theory — has developed. This theory is based on the idea that parties
write incomplete contracts ex ante and that the allocation of asset ownership influences how
contracts are completed ex post. In the standard model parties reach an ex post efficient outcome
through renegotiation once the state of the world is realized. However, the ability to exercise
residual control rights increases the incentive of an asset owner to make noncontractible
relationship‐specific investments, and, as a consequence it is optimal to assign asset ownership
to those whose investments are most important.1 Empirical support for the idea that
noncontractible investments are influenced by asset ownership can be found in a number of
papers, including Woodruff (2002), Baker and Hubbard (2003, 2004), and Acemoglu et al.
(2010); see also the discussion of franchising in Lafontaine and Slade (2007).
As is now well known, one weakness of the property rights theory is that in the standard model
only a particular class of contracts is considered. Specifically, revelation mechanisms of the
Moore‐Repullo‐Maskin‐Tirole type (in combination with third parties and/or lotteries) can do
better and indeed often achieve the first‐best. Such mechanisms are not observed in reality but
they pose a challenge to the theory.
Partly to overcome this weakness, an alternative approach has recently been developed based on
the idea that contracts are reference points.2 According to this approach a contract, negotiated
under (relatively) competitive conditions, circumscribes or delineates parties’ feelings of
entitlement. Parties do not feel entitled to outcomes outside the contract, but they may feel
entitled to different outcomes within the contract. When a party does not receive his entitlement,
he feels aggrieved and shades in noncontractible ways, hurting the other party, and creating
deadweight losses. Under these assumptions a more open‐ended contract leads to more
aggrievement and shading, and there is an optimal degree of contractual flexibility. Revelation
mechanisms do not achieve the first‐best because they depend on the existence of many possible
outcomes, and therefore cause shading. In Hart (2009) and Hart and Holmstrom (2010), this
approach is used to develop theories of asset ownership and firm boundaries.
So far the literature on contracts as reference points has focused on ex post inefficiency and has
downplayed noncontractible investments. An open question is whether the newer approach can
incorporate such investments and whether it is consistent with the empirical findings, referred
to above, that asset ownership influences such investments. The purpose of the present paper is
to provide a positive answer to this question.
We develop a simple model in which a seller invests in the quality of a good or service provided
to a buyer (thus the investment is a “cross‐investment” in the sense of MacLeod and Malcomson
1 See Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990), and Hart (1995). For a recent summary of this theory and
its applications, see Aghion and Holden (2011).
2 See Hart and Moore (2008). For some experimental evidence supporting this theory, see Fehr et al. (2011).
Another approach that has been pursued explores the idea that revelation mechanisms may not be robust. See
Aghion et al. (2010).

(1993) or Che and Hausch (1999)). The investment is discrete (invest or don’t invest), while ex
post trade is continuous and can be any level between zero and one. The buyer’s value can be
high or low, and the seller’s investment affects the probability that the value is high. Value is
observable to both parties but not verifiable. The buyer and seller have outside options that
depend on the ex ante allocation of asset ownership and the value of the good. There are always
gains from trade and so in an ideal world trade would always take place at the level one.
In our model, in contrast to much of the literature on contracts as reference points, specific
performance is allowed. Therefore, in the absence of investment the first‐best could easily be
achieved with a contract that mandates trade at a fixed price. Specific performance generates no
shading since the contract is rigid and contains only one outcome. In such a setting, asset
ownership would have no role.
However, a specific performance contract does not achieve the first‐best in the presence of
investment. The seller has no incentive to invest since she receives the same price whether value
is high or low. In order to encourage investment the parties will choose a more flexible contract;
for example, they might allow the seller to make a take‐it‐or‐leave‐it offer to the buyer. In this
paper we will rule out renegotiation and so in the absence of shading such a contract would
achieve the first‐best: the seller receives all the surplus and so has the socially correct
investment incentives. However, in the presence of shading such a contract does not achieve the
first‐best since the buyer will feel aggrieved when the seller chooses a high price. We will show
that the first‐best is generally no longer attainable, and that the parties face a trade‐off between
providing investment incentives, achieving ex post efficiency, and avoiding shading.
We find that there are two leading candidates for an optimal contract if investment is desired. In
one ex post efficiency is achieved but the parties restrict the range of prices from which the seller
can choose ex post to be as small as possible subject to the seller having an incentive to invest.
This contract will lead to some shading. The second contract introduces some ex post
inefficiency by allowing the seller to choose between two ex post outcomes: trade at a level of
one at a high price or trade at a level below one at a low price. The outcomes are designed so that
the buyer is indifferent between the two outcomes if value is high, but strictly prefers the low
trade outcome if value is low. In this contract there is no shading. In Section 2, we show that, in
the absence of asset ownership and outside options, one of the above two contracts, or specific
performance (which yields no investment), is second‐best optimal.
In Section 3, we introduce asset ownership and show that this can improve matters. First,
suppose that the optimal contract is one that allows the seller to choose from a range of prices.
Then an allocation of asset ownership that yields a high outside option for the seller in the high
value state can reduce the buyer’s feelings of aggrievement, and hence shading, to the extent that
the buyer does not feel entitled to a price that would cause the seller to quit. Second, suppose the
optimal contract is one that creates ex post inefficiency. Then a judicious allocation of asset
ownership can increase total surplus by providing higher value when trade does not take place.
In Section 4 we show that our results are robust to the introduction of revelation mechanisms.

As noted, in this paper we rule out renegotiation. We do this mainly because revelation
mechanisms are most powerful if parties can commit not to renegotiate and we want to show
that even under these conditions asset ownership matters. However, the absence of
renegotiation can also be justified on the grounds that (opportunistic) renegotiation can lead to
(even) higher levels of aggrievement and shading and so parties may be discouraged from
attempting it (see Hart and Moore (2008) and Hart (2009) for discussions).We discuss briefly
how renegotiation would affect our results in Section 5.
The paper is organized as follows. The model is presented in Section 2 for the special case where
outside options are zero. Asset ownership and outside options are introduced in Section 3.
Sections 2 and 3 focus on a particular class of contracts. In Section 4 general revelation game
contracts are considered and the contracts of Sections 2 and 3 are shown to be optimal under
certain conditions. Section 5 concludes.

2. The Model
We consider a buyer and seller who can trade a good. There are three dates. At date 0 the parties
meet and contract. At date ½ the seller can make a noncontractible investment that affects the
quality of the good. At date 1 trade occurs.
For the moment we suppose that the parties’ outside options are zero; we relax this assumption
in Sections 3 and 4. We assume that the value of the good can be vH or vL , where vH > vL > 0. The
seller can affect the probability of high value through her investment. If the seller invests, the
probability that v = vH is π , where 0 < π < 1. For simplicity, we suppose that, if the seller does
not invest, v = vL with probability 1. The seller incurs a nonverifiable cost c > 0 if she invests.
Both parties learn the value of v just before date 1 (and hence before they trade); however, v is
not verifiable. The seller’s variable costs at date 1 are zero. There is no discounting and both
parties are risk neutral and have no wealth constraints.
In the first‐best trade would always occur at date 1 since vL > 0; and investment would take place
as long as the social gain exceeds the social cost:
(2.1)

π vH + (1 – π) vL – c > vL ,

that is,
(2.2)

π ( vH – vL ) > c.

We will be interested in the case where (2.2) holds. In contrast to the previous literature on
contracts as reference points, we suppose that, if trade fails to occur, it is clear who is
responsible and so that party can be penalized. Thus, if (2.2) does not hold, it is easy to achieve
the first‐best with a specific performance contract: trade is mandated at date 1 at a fixed price; a
party who refuses to trade has to pay large damages. However, if (2.2) holds, a specific
performance contract does not achieve the first‐best since the seller has no incentive to invest:
she receives the same price whether v is high or low. (Of course, if v were verifiable, price could
be made contingent on v.)
In the second‐best a contract will consist of a set of trade‐price vectors and a mechanism for
choosing among them at date 1. This mechanism will be played after v is realized. We will
assume that partial trade is feasible; this is never optimal in the first‐best. Denote a typical trade‐
price vector by ( λ,p), where 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 is the quantity traded and p is the price. That is, the buyer
pays the total amount p for receiving the quantity of the good λ. The buyer’s payoff is
, and
the seller’s payoff is p (ignoring investment costs).

We follow Hart and Moore (2008) in supposing that a contract is a reference point for
entitlements. Thus a contract can generate aggrievement and shading and this will affect not only
ex post surplus but also the seller’s incentive to invest. In this section, but not in Section 4, we
will restrict attention to voluntary trade contracts in which each party can quit ex post without
penalty. In this case we compute aggrievement as in Hart and Moore (2008). A party is entitled
to the best outcome in the contract. That is, a party’s entitlement is given by his maximized
payoff over all possible contractual outcomes, subject to the other party’s (ex post) participation
constraint being satisfied; that is, the other party does not quit. (In the background there is an
assumption that there is a competitive market at date 0 and so both parties feel that the initial
contract is “fair”. See Hart and Moore (2008) for further discussion of this.) Aggrievement is the
difference between the party’s entitlement and what the party actually receives. A party who is
aggrieved shades (shading is not contractible). Shading equals aggrievement multiplied by θ ,
where 0 < θ < 1. This shading reduces the other party’s payoff (by the amount of shading)
without affecting the payoff of the shading party.
Let’s start with the case where there is no shading: θ = 0. Since in this paper we rule out
renegotiation (but see the discussion in the conclusions), it is then easy to achieve the first‐best.
The parties can simply agree in advance that the seller will make a take‐it‐or‐leave‐it offer to the
buyer at date 1. The seller will propose price p = vH in the good (high value) state, price p = vL in
the bad (low value) state, the buyer will accept and the seller will capture all the surplus. This
gives the seller the socially correct investment incentives. (Lump sum transfers can be used to
divide up the surplus ex ante.)
If θ > 0, however, a contract that allows the seller to pick pH= vH or pL = vL does not achieve the
first‐best. In the good state the seller will propose vH , and the buyer will accept this, but he will
feel entitled to the lower price vL and will shade by θ (vH – vL). The buyer will not shade in the
bad state since he receives the lowest possible contractual price, and the seller will not shade in
the good state since she receives the highest possible contractual price. Finally, the seller will not
shade in the bad state since she does not feel entitled to an outcome in which the buyer makes a
loss (i.e., quits).
One way the parties can reduce shading is to restrict the range of allowable prices. Suppose that
they agree that the seller can choose either pH, where vH ≥ pH > vL, or pL = vL . Then the buyer’s
shading in the good state is reduced to θ (pH ‐ vL ). The seller’s payoff in this state net of shading
costs is pH – θ (pH – vL ) 0. The condition for the seller to invest is thus:
(2.3)

π ( pH – θ (pH – vL )) + (1 – π) vL – c ≥ vL ,

that is,

5|Page

(2.4)

π (pH – vL )(1 – θ) ≥ c .

Shading is minimized if (2.4) holds with equality, and so we can solve for pH . We need to check
that the buyer is willing to pay pH in the good state:
(2.5)

vH ≥ pH ,

that is,
(2.6)

vH ≥

π

θ

+ vL .

((2.6) will not hold if θ is close to 1.) Gross social surplus (ignoring the investment cost c) is
given by
(2.7)

S1 = π ( vH – θ (pH – vL)) + (1 – π) vL
= π vH + (1 – π) vL –

θ
θ

.

For future reference we call this contract, where λH = λL = 1, pH =

π

θ

+ vL , pL = vL , the

“efficient trade” contract, since λ=1 in both states.
Another way for the parties to reduce shading is to make the ( λ , p) outcome in the bad state less
attractive to the high value buyer. As in the asymmetric information literature this can be
achieved by reducing λL. Let ( λH , pH ), (λL , pL ) denote the trade‐price vectors in the good and
bad states respectively. Keep λH = 1 and choose λL so that the high value buyer is indifferent
between ( λH , pH ) and (λL , pL ). This yields
(2.8)

vH – pH = λL vH – pL .

Since the high value buyer is indifferent, he is not aggrieved and does not shade. Thus the
condition for the seller to invest is now
(2.9)

π (pH – pL ) ≥ c .

Combining (2.8)‐(2.9) yields
(2.10)

λL

1–

π H

.

For ex post efficiency reasons we want λL to be as large as possible and so (2.10) will hold with
equality. We continue to set pL = L vL, so that the buyer breaks even in the bad state. This

ensures that the seller chooses (λL , pL ) in the bad state and that there is no seller aggrievement:
the seller does not feel entitled to an outcome where the buyer would quit. The gross surplus
from this contract is

+ λL vL , pL = λL vL, the

“no aggrievement” contract.
The general analysis in Section 4 allows us to establish that either specific performance (yielding
no investment) or one of the above two contracts—“efficient trade” or “no aggrievement” ‐‐ is
optimal.

Proposition 1.
(1) If max (vL , S1 – c, S2 – c) = vL the optimal contract is specific performance. Net surplus is vL.
(2) If max (vL , S1 – c, S2 – c) > vL then there is an optimal contract of the following form: the seller
chooses between (λH , pH) and (λL , pL) at date 1 and the buyer can reject without penalty (leading
to no trade), where
(2a) If max (vL , S1 – c, S2 – c) = S1 – c, λH = λL = 1, pH =

π

θ

+ vL , pL = vL (the “efficient trade”

contract). Net surplus is S1 – c.
(2b) If max (vL , S1 – c, S2 – c) = S2 – c, λH = 1, λL = 1 –

π VH

, pH =

π

+ λL vL , pL = λL vL (the “no

aggrievement” contract). Net surplus is S2 – c .

Note that in Case 2a, S1 – c > vL , and it is easy to show that this implies (2.6).3
It follows immediately from Proposition 1 that, if investment is first‐best efficient ((2.2) holds),
then the second‐best is strictly inferior to the first‐best: in (1) there is no investment, and in (2)
there is shading or inefficient trade. At the same time note that, if θ is close to zero, the “efficient
3

One important assumption that we are making implicitly is that the buyer is not aggrieved about the seller’s investment
decision per se. If he were then a specific performance contract might cause some shading as a result of the buyer being
disappointed that the seller has not invested. One might even imagine that the seller would invest to forestall the buyer
becoming angry and shading. Investigating situations where aggrievement is a result of ex ante as well as ex post actions
is an interesting topic for future research, but lies outside the scope of the current paper.

trade” contract approximates the first‐best, since there is very little shading; and, if vL is close to
zero, the “no aggrievement” contract approximates the first‐best, since the efficiency losses from
inefficient trade in the bad state are small.

3. Asset Ownership and Outside Options
We have seen in Section 2 that if (2.2) holds the first‐best cannot be achieved. It is thus natural to
ask how the second‐best outcome might be improved. The property rights literature suggests
that asset ownership helps. We explore this here.
We take a simple view that asset ownership affects outside options. In particular, an allocation of
asset ownership at date 0 permits the seller to achieve rHS , rLS in the high value and low value
state, respectively, without trading with the buyer; and the buyer to achieve rHB , rLB in the high
value and low value state without trading with the seller. More generally, we suppose that the
parties’ payoffs are linear in the level of trade. Thus, under the trade‐price vector (λ, p) in state j
(j = H, L) the buyer’s payoff is equal to λ times his payoff under the contract (1,p) plus (1‐ λ )
times his payoff under the contract (0,p); that is, the buyer’s payoff is
(3.1)

λ v

p

1

λ)( r B – p )= λ vj + (1–λ r B – p .

Similarly, the seller’s payoff is
(3.2)

λ p+ 1

λ) r S +p)=p + (1 – λ) r S .

We assume
(3.3)

rHB ≥ rLB ≥ 0, rHS ≥ rLS ≥ 0,

and that ex post trade is always efficient:
(3.4)

vH > rHB + rHS , vL ≥ rLB + rLS .

We also suppose
(3.5)

vH – rHB – rHS ≥ vL – rLB – rLS

and
(3.6)

π (vH – rHB – vL + rLB ) ≥ c.

(3.5) says that the net surplus from the relationship is higher in the good state than in the bad
one. In other words the investment enhances the value of the relationship. (3.6) ensures that the
seller will want to invest in the case of no shading when she can make a take‐it‐or‐leave‐it offer
9|Page

to the buyer.4 Note that if the seller’s investment is purely an investment in the seller’s human
capital, then rHB = rLB . In contrast if the buyer can appropriate some of the investment then we
can have rHB > rLB . (3.5) and (3.6) both limit how much rHB can exceed rLB .5
As in Section 2, if no investment is desirable, the first‐best can be achieved with a specific
performance contract. From now on we focus on the investment case. It is helpful to divide our
analysis into two subcases. We start with the situation where the seller’s outside option does not
vary with her investment, e.g., because the seller’s investment is specific to the buyer:
(3.7)

rHS = rLS .

(3.7) is restrictive, but it turns out that this case is tractable.
It is useful to compute the analogous contracts to the “efficient trade” and “no aggrievement”
contracts in Section 2. The “efficient trade” contract is characterized by
(3.8) λH = λL = 1, pH

π

θ

+ pL , pL = vL – rLB .

In (3.8), the buyer’s participation constraint is binding in the bad state. The buyer is aggrieved by
pH pL
in the good state since the seller earns above her outside option when receiving
π

θ

pL ((3.4) and (3.7) imply that vL – rLB ≥ rLS
rHS ); hence, the buyer feels entitled to pay pL .The
seller is indifferent between investing and not (see (2.3) with vL replaced by pL ). The condition
that the buyer does not quit in the good state is
(3.9)

vH – rHB – vL

rLB ≥

θ π

.

Surplus from this contract is given by S1 , as in (2.7).
Turn next to the “no aggrievement” contract. The condition that the high value buyer is
indifferent between the high and low value outcomes, which implies that he does not shade,
becomes
(3.10)

vH – pH = λL vH + (1–λL rHB – pL ,

In the absence of (3.6), revelation schemes in combination with third parties and/or lotteries may be required to
achieve the first‐best even when θ = 0.
5 Note that we suppose that the parties cannot restrict the impact of outside options on payoffs in (3.1)‐(3.2) except
though the choice of λ , e.g., they cannot write exclusive dealing contracts.
4

and the condition for the seller to be just willing to invest is
(3.11)

pH = pL + + (1 – λL) rLS .
π

Finally, the condition that the buyer’s participation constraint is binding in the bad state is
λ vL + (1–λ rHB – pL =rHB ,

(3.12)
that is,

pL = λL (vL– rLB ).

Then:

(1) If max (vL, S1 – c, S – c) = vL the optimal contract is specific performance. Net surplus is vL .
(2) If max (vL, S1 – c, S – c) > vL, then there is an optimal contract of the following form: the
seller chooses between (λH, pH) and (λL, pL) at date 1 and the buyer can reject without penalty
(leading to no trade), where

surplus is S – c.

Remark: If contract (2a) is optimal then it must be superior to specific performance. (3.16) then
implies that (3.9) is satisfied.
If we compare S2 with S we see that the presence of an outside option for the seller strictly
increases surplus: S = S2 when rLS = rLB
rHB 0 and S is strictly increasing in rLS . However,
the effect of an outside option for the buyer is ambiguous. S strictly increases if rLB goes up , or
if rLB , rHB go up equally, but it strictly decreases if rHB goes up. The intuition is that an increase in
rLS has two effects. It decreases the seller’s incentive to invest and hence λL in (3.14) must fall to
compensate for this; but it also decreases the effects of inefficient trade since value outside the
relationship is higher. The second effect dominates. An increase in rLB
has only the second effect and so increases surplus. Finally, an increase in rHB unambiguously
decreases surplus because it reduces the amount the seller can be paid in the good state and
hence λL in (3.14) must fall to restore the seller’s investment incentives; and the increase in rHB
has no beneficial effect on ex post efficiency since λH
1, i. e., rHB is never earned.
In sum, seller outside options are unambiguously good for surplus (given (3.7)), whereas buyer
options need not be (given that it is the seller who is investing).
We now turn to the case where rHS > rLS . Unfortunately, this case is more complex, the results of
Section 4 do not apply, and I have been unable to solve for an optimal contract. Thus we will
simply characterize some leading contracts.

12 | P a g e

Consider the contracts in Proposition 2. Make one small change in the assumption about
aggrievement. Suppose that if pH , pL are the contractual prices then the parties feel entitled to
any price in the range [pL , pH ], not just to pL,pH.6 Start with the “efficient trade” contract in (3.8).
In the presence of outside options the buyer does not expect to pay less than rHS in the good
state and so if rHS > vL – rLB , his aggrievement and shading in the good state will be lower than
before. In fact, if π rHS
rLB – vL
c, we can achieve the first‐best: set pL = vL – rLB , pH = rHS .
The buyer is not aggrieved in the good state because he does not feel entitled to an outcome
where the seller would quit; and the buyer does not quit himself since, by (3.4), vH rHS rHB .
The buyer is not aggrieved in the bad state since he pays the lowest price and the seller is not
aggrieved in the good state since she receives the highest price. The seller is not aggrieved in the
bad state since the buyer’s participation constraint is binding. Finally, the seller has an incentive
to invest since π rHS
rLB – vL
c.
Next assume that rHS > vL – rLB , but that π rHS + rLB
vL ) < c . Now the first‐best cannot be
achieved. The constraint that the seller is just willing to invest becomes
(3.17)

π (pH –pL – θ (pH – rHS )) = c ,

that is, if we set pL = vL – rLB , so that the buyer’s participation constraint is binding in the bad
state,

The third case is where rHS vL – rLB . Here the analysis is as in Section 2. Combining the above

set λH = 1 and pH = rHS . Then because the buyer does not expect the seller to earn less than her
outside option the buyer will not be aggrieved in the good state even if he strictly prefers (λL, pL)
to (λH, pH) . Now choose (λL, pL) so that the buyer’s participation constraint is binding in the bad
state and the seller has an incentive to invest:

To emphasize again: this contract produces no aggrievement or shading since in the good state
the buyer does not feel entitled to pay less than the seller’s outside option and the seller is
getting the highest price; and in the bad state the buyer prefers (λL, pL) to (λH, pH), but the buyer’s
participation constraint is binding and so the seller does not feel entitled to more.
Note the importance of the assumption that rHS

not prefer (λL, pL) to (λH, pH), the seller would choose (λH, pH) in the bad state, and this would not
give her the right incentive to invest. To sum up:

need to include these inequalities as extra conditions in Proposition 3 (see (*)).
Armed with Propositions 2 and 3, let us now turn to the effects of asset ownership. Suppose that
there is a fixed set of assets at the disposal of the buyer and the seller, where these assets can be
individually or jointly owned. We would expect that the more assets a party owns, and therefore
can walk away with if the relationship breaks down, the higher will be that party’s outside
option. We might also expect that asset ownership would affect the outside option in the good
state more than in the bad state (this is the assumption made in much of the property rights
literature). We therefore assume:
(**) If an asset that was previously owned by the buyer, or was jointly owned, now becomes
owned by the seller then rHS , rLS and rHS rLS rise weakly, and rHB , rLB and rHB rLB fall
weakly; and vice versa if ownership shifts from the seller to the buyer.
Let’s start with the case where rHS rLS and (3.16) holds. Then Proposition 2 tells us that outside
options matter only if the “no aggrievement” contract in (2b) is optimal. In this case it follows
from (3.15) that, keeping rHB rLB constant, it is optimal to allocate assets to maximize rLB rLS
and, keeping rLB rLS constant, it is optimal to allocate assets to minimize rHB rLB . The first goal
improves ex post efficiency whereas the second goal helps with investment incentives.
According to (**), the second goal is achieved by allocating ownership to the seller. However, it is

relative to the first‐best (see (3.15)). The second “no aggrievement” contract is not feasible since rHS < vL ‐ rLB . Now
consider the following contract: λH = 1, λL =1, pH = 10, pL =10 ‐ 2c , where the buyer chooses between the two at date
1 and the seller can quit. There is no longer any buyer aggrievement in the good state since the seller’s participation
constraint is binding (and there is no buyer aggrievement in the bad state since the buyer gets the lowest possible
price). There is no seller aggrievement in the good state because the seller gets the highest possible price. However,
there is seller aggrievement in the bad state: the seller receives 10‐2c but feels entitled to 10 since this would still
satisfy the buyer’s participation constraint. It is easy to see that the seller invests. Gross social surplus is given by S
= π vH + (1 ‐ π) vL ‐ π θ (pH – pL) = π vH + (1 ‐ π) vL – θ c. In other words the loss relative to the first‐best is θc,

possible that the buyer has greater use for the assets than the seller if the relationship breaks
down in the bad state, in which case the first goal—maximizing rLB rLS —would be achieved by
allocating ownership to the buyer. Thus in general there is a trade‐off.
One case where we can make a clear prediction is if an asset is idiosyncratic to the seller: we
define this to mean that the asset yields a zero outside option for the buyer and a positive outside
option for the seller.

Proof. Compare S2 with S and note that S is strictly increasing in rLS .
Proposition 4 implies that joint ownership of an asset (or separate ownership of strictly
complementary assets) is suboptimal. An asset that is jointly owned yields a zero outside option
for the buyer but would yield a positive outside option for the seller if ownership were
transferred to her.
Proposition 4 does not generalize to the buyer. It may not be optimal for the buyer to own assets

Let’s turn now to the case where rHS
characterized an optimal contract. We will content ourselves with the following observation.
Take the view that, if all the assets are jointly owned, then outside options are zero: we are in the
situation of Section 2. From Proposition 1 (or Proposition 2) we know what the optimal contract
is in this case: surplus is max {vL, S1 – c, S2 – c}. Now allocate all the assets to the seller. Given (**)
the seller’s outside options rise at least weakly and the buyer’s outside options remain at zero.
Apply Proposition 3. This tells us that surplus rises (at least weakly) since S

Thus, we have

ownership of each asset is allocated to the seller, surplus rises weakly. Furthermore it rises

Proof. It remains only to establish strictness. But this follows from the fact that, if rLS 0 and
rHS
vL rLB , and rLB rHB = 0, the right‐hand side of (3.20), (3.15) exceeds that of (2.7),
(2.11), respectively.
Q.E.D.
Note that Proposition 5 also applies when rHS

rLS .

Proposition 5 provides some support for the idea, that, taking joint ownership as a starting point,
allocating ownership of all the assets to the seller can bring us closer to the first‐best. The
intuition is that an increase in rLS reduces ex post inefficiency if λL < 1 , raising S (see (3.15));
and an increase in rHS makes it easier to reward the seller in the good state without causing
buyer aggrievement: S rises (see (3.20)). The buyer’s outside options do not change since they
were zero under joint ownership and are also zero when the seller owns all the assets. Finally,
the new outcome yielding S3 may become available (see (3.24)).
It is interesting to compare the results on asset ownership in this section with Hart (2009). In
that paper there is no investment and assets are allocated to avoid ex post hold‐up, which causes
large amounts of aggrievement and shading. It is shown that a party whose payoff is relatively
uncertain should own more assets and that a party should own an asset if it is idiosyncratic to
him. In the present paper, where seller investment incentives are crucial, seller incentives
replace uncertainty as a driving force and push us in the direction of seller ownership. Also, we
saw in the discussion of Proposition 4 that, although the seller should own assets idiosyncratic to
her, the buyer should not necessarily own assets idiosyncratic to him since this can interfere
with the seller’s investment incentives.

17 | P a g e

4. More General Contracts
In this section we show that, for the case where the seller’s outside options are state
independent—rHS rLS r S , say—the contracts described in Propositions 1 and 2 are optimal
among a class of contracts that includes revelation mechanisms.
As in Hart and Moore (2008), a (general) contract is a set ∑ of trade‐price vectors (λ,p) and a
stochastic mapping from a pair of messages β, σ, reported by the buyer and seller, respectively,
onto ∑ . Since stochastic combinations of (λ,p) vectors are themselves equivalent in payoff terms
to (λ,p) vectors (given the risk neutrality of parties), we can write the outcomes of this
mechanism in the good and bad states as (λH,pH), (λL,pL), respectively, and suppose that they lie
in ∑. (We do not allow for third parties in the contract; we doubt that they would add anything in
the present context.)
Each party feels entitled to the best contractual outcome for him subject to the other party
realizing some reservation payoff. In the case of voluntary trade this reservation payoff is the
party’s outside option since each party can quit without penalty. But what is it more generally
(e.g., if one party cannot quit at all or can quit only by paying some penalty or must play some
other game to determine the quitting price)? Following Hart and Moore (2008) we take the view
that a party’s reservation payoff is the maximum that the party can achieve from the contract
whatever the other party does, where, in the present context, the other party’s actions can
include unlimited shading. In effect we suppose in the above message game that the first party
maximizes his payoff and the second party minimizes the first party’s payoff. Given unlimited
shading, the payoff of the first party will be ∞ whenever λ>0 and will equal his outside option
whenever λ=0.
Since this game is zero‐sum it has a unique equilibrium in payoff terms. Player 1’s reservation
payoff is his equilibrium payoff in this game. (It might be ∞.) We can carry out a similar
exercise for the second player. This will be a different game since the roles are reversed: player 2
maximizes his payoff while player 1 minimizes player 2’s payoff. Player 2’s reservation payoff is
his equilibrium payoff in this game.
Note that a party’s reservation payoff will generally differ from his outside option. For example,
under a specific performance contract a party’s outside option is irrelevant.
Denote the seller’s reservation payoff by RS and the buyer’s by RB. By assumption the seller’s
outside option is state‐independent and thus so is RS. However, the buyer’s reservation payoff
can vary with the state and hence we write RBH for the buyer’s reservation payoff in the good
state and RBL for his reservation payoff in the bad state.
18 | P a g e

Armed with these reservation payoffs, we can compute aggrievement levels for the buyer and
seller in the two states as follows:

where j=H, L denotes the state and ∑ is the convex hull of ∑. The reason for replacing ∑ by its
convex hull is that we take the view that if (λ1,p1) , (λ2,p2 ) ∑, and (λ1,p1) is below player 1’s
reservation level while (λ2,p2 ) is above, then player 2 feels entitled to a convex combination of
(λ1,p1) , (λ2,p2 ) such that player 1’s reservation level is satisfied in expected terms.
An optimal contract, which induces investment, is a choice of ∑ and a message game that
maximizes the expected social surplus subject to the investment constraint; that is, which
maximizes

would not be possible if the seller’s outside options varied with the state.) It follows that

Consider the relaxed problem in which we replace (4.1)—(4.2) by (4.6) —(4.7), and choose
(λH,pH), (λL,pL) directly, ignoring the constraint that they must be the equilibrium of some
mechanism. In other words, we maximize S subject to (4.4) and (4.6) —(4.7). It is immediate
that in the relaxed problem it is optimal to set aSH
aSL 0. Also, if λH
1, S can be raised by

increasing λH and pH such that pH λH r stays constant, since this increases λH vH rHB
pH and hence reduces the right‐hand side of (4.6), and does not disturb (4.4). Hence λH 1. In
addition we always want aBH as low as possible. Hence (4.6) holds with equality. Finally, if (4.4)
holds strictly, we can increase S by lowering pH. Hence (4.4) holds with equality.
We can thus consider the further relaxed problem:

only if aBL > 0. In this case reducing aBL a little and raising pH to keep (4.9) satisfied increases S.

S is decreasing in λL by (3.5) and so it is optimal to reduce λL to the point where either aBL = 0 in

Hence λL will be such that aBL = 0 and we can solve (4.12) to obtain

Hence λL = 0 is optimal. But substituting λH = 1, λL = 0 in (4.8) shows that surplus is weakly
lower, and strictly lower if aBL > 0, than in the “no aggrievement” contract identified in Case 2.
Hence λH = 1, λL = 0, aBL >0 cannot be optimal.
We are left with the case where aBL = 0. Since S is linear in λL, either λL = 0 or λL = 1 is optimal (or
all 0 ≤ λL ≤ 1). We have already argued that λH = 1, λL = 0 is (weakly) dominated by the “no
aggrievement” contract in Case 2. All that remains is λH = λL = 1. But this is the other contract
considered in Proposition 2.

Let pL vL rLB in the first contract and pL λL vL rLB in the second. Then it is easy to
check that the outcomes in (4.18) and (4.19) can both be implemented by allowing the seller to
choose between (λH,pH) and (λL,pL) at date 1 with the buyer able to say no, i.e., to quit without
penalty. Note that (3.16) implies that, if the λL λH 1 outcome in (4.18) is superior to specific
performance, (3.9) is satisfied.
Thus we have found a mechanism that implements the solution of the relaxed problem.
Moreover, it satisfies all the constraints of the original problem, (4.3)‐(4.4). Therefore it must
solve the original problem. We have thus proved Propositions 1 and 2.
Remark: It is worth considering why this argument does not apply when rHS rLS . The reason is
that in the good state of the world (λL,pL) may be below the seller’s reservation level and so the
buyer may not feel entitled to it. However, following our earlier discussion, if (λH,pH) provides
the seller with strictly more than her reservation payoff in the good state, the buyer will feel
entitled to a convex combination of (λH,pH) and (λL,pL) such that the seller receives her
reservation payoff in expected turns. Convexification destroys the linearity that made the above
analysis relatively simple, and I have been unable to characterize an optimum in this case.
Among other things it is possible that an optimal contract will now consist of more than two
trade‐price vectors. (This may also be a feature of an optimal contract when (3.16) fails to hold.)

5. Conclusions
In this paper we have studied a model where the purpose of a long‐term contract is to encourage
a seller to make a quality‐enhancing investment, as well as to achieve ex post efficiency and to
avoid shading. We have shown that, if contracts are reference points, the first‐best cannot be
achieved even when the parties can commit not to renegotiate. We have also shown that asset
ownership can increase efficiency.
One obvious question to ask is, what happens if we suppose instead that parties can always
renegotiate. This will change the analysis in a number of ways. First, inefficient ex post outcomes,
where λ <1, will no longer be sustainable. Second, certain kinds of (opportunistic) renegotiation
may lead to (even) higher levels of aggrievement and shading. Third, the possibility of
renegotiation will make it harder to allocate surplus to the seller: even if the seller has the right
to make take‐it‐or‐leave‐it offers, the buyer can reject the seller’s offer and renegotiate. As
Moore and Repullo (1988) and Maskin and Tirole (1999) have shown, third parties and/or
lotteries can help under such conditions. Solving for an optimal contract in the presence of
shading, third parties and/or lotteries is a (challenging) topic for future research. However, there
seems no reason to think that the main result of this paper—that asset ownership matters—will
be overturned.
