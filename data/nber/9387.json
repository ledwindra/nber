In addition, U.S. tariff data at the HS level have been added for the years 1989-2001. Earlier CD-ROMs distributed by the NBER described data on U.S. imports and exports from 1972-1994, and these values have been slightly modified for 1989-1994 and then updated to 2001. Together with the earlier data, there are now 30 years of disaggregate U.S. trade data available to researchers.\n\n",
