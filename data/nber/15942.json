    "abstract": "\n\nWe conduct an empirical study of the impact of consumer price-search on the shifting of cigarette excise taxes to consumer prices.   We use novel data on the prices smokers report actually paying for cigarettes.  We document substantial price dispersion.  We find that cigarette  taxes are shifted at lower rates to the prices paid by consumers who undertake more price search - carton buyers, and especially, smokers who buy cartons of cigarettes in a state other than their state of residence.  We also find suggestive evidence that taxes are shifted at slightly higher rates to the prices paid by non-daily smokers, less addicted smokers, and smokers of light cigarettes.\n\n",
