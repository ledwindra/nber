AI and Jobs: the role of demand
James Bessen
NBER Working Paper No. 24235
January 2018
JEL No. J2,N10,O3
ABSTRACT
Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies will automate many jobs, but the effect on employment is
not obvious. In manufacturing, technology has sharply reduced jobs in recent decades. But before
that, for over a century, employment grew, even in industries experiencing rapid technological
change. What changed? Demand was highly elastic at first and then became inelastic. The effect
of artificial intelligence on jobs will similarly depend critically on the nature of demand. This
paper presents a simple model of demand that accurately predicts the rise and fall of employment
in the textile, steel and automotive industries. This model provides a useful framework for
exploring how AI is likely to affect jobs over the next 10 or 20 years.

There is widespread concern today that artificial intelligence technologies will create
mass unemployment during the next 10 or 20 years. One recent paper concluded that new
information technologies will put “a substantial share of employment, across a wide range of
occupations, at risk in the near future” (Frey and Osborne 2013).
The example of manufacturing decline provides good reason to be concerned about
technology and job losses. In 1958, the U.S. broadwoven textile industry employed over
300,000 production workers, and the primary steel industry employed over 500,000. By
2011, broadwoven textiles employed only 16,000, and steel employed only 100,000
production workers. 1 Some of these losses can be attributed to trade, especially since the
mid-1990s. However, overall since the 1950s, most of the decline appears to come from
technology and changing demand (Rowthorn and Ramaswamy 1999).
But the example of manufacturing also demonstrates that the effect of technology on
employment is more complicated than a simple story of “automation causes job losses” in
the affected industries. Indeed, Figure 1 shows how textiles, steel and automotive
manufacturing all enjoyed strong employment growth during many decades that also
experienced very rapid productivity growth. Despite persistent and substantial productivity
growth, these industries have spent more decades with growing employment than with job
losses. This “inverted U” pattern appears to be quite general for manufacturing industries
(Buera and Kaboski 2009; Rodrik 2016).
The reason automation in textiles, steel and automotive manufacturing led to strong
job growth has to do with the effect of technology on demand, as I explore below. New
technologies do not just replace labor with machines, but, in a competitive market,

automation will reduce prices. In addition, technology may improve product quality,
customization or speed of delivery. All of these things can increase demand. If demand
increases sufficiently, employment will grow even though the labor required per unit of
output declines.
Of course, job losses in one industry might be offset by employment growth in other
industries. Such macroeconomic effects are covered by other papers in this volume (Sachs;
Aghion et al.). This paper explores the effect of technology on employment in the affected
industry itself. The rise and fall of employment poses an important puzzle. While a
substantial literature has looked at structural change associated with technology, I argue that
the most widely accepted explanations for deindustrialization are inconsistent with the
observed historical pattern. To explain the inverted U pattern, I present a very simple model
that shows why demand for these products was highly elastic during the early years and why
demand became inelastic over time. This model forecasts the rise and fall of employment in
these industries with reasonable accuracy: the solid line in Figure 1 shows those predictions.
I then explore the implications of this model for the future impact of artificial intelligence
over the next two decades.
Structural change
The inverted U pattern in Figure 1 is also seen in the relative share of employment in
the whole manufacturing sector, shown in Figure 2. Logically, the rise and fall of the sector
as a whole in this chart results from the aggregate rise and fall of separate manufacturing
industries such as those in Figure 1. Yet, explanations of this phenomenon based on broad
sector-level factors face a challenge because individual industries show rather disparate
patterns. For example, employment in the automotive industry appears to have peaked

3

nearly a century after textile employment peaked. Data on individual industries are needed to
analyze such disparate responses.
The literature on structural change provides two sorts of accounts for the relative
size of the manufacturing sector, one based on differential rates of productivity growth, the
other based on different income elasticities of demand. 2 Baumol (1967) showed that the
greater rate of technical change in manufacturing industries relative to services leads to a
declining share of manufacturing employment under some conditions (see also Lawrence
and Edwards 2013; Ngai and Pissarides 2007; Matsuyama 2009).
But differences in productivity growth rates do not seem to explain the initial rise in
employment. For example, during the 19th century, the share of employment in agriculture
fell while employment in manufacturing industries such as textiles and steel soared both in
absolute and relative terms. But labor productivity in these manufacturing industries grew
faster than labor productivity in agricultural. Parker and Klein (1966) find that labor
productivity in corn, oats and wheat grew 2.4 percent, 2.3 percent and 2.6 percent per
annum from 1840-60 to 1900-10. In contrast, labor productivity in cotton textiles grew 3
percent per year from 1820 to 1900 and labor productivity in steel grew 3 percent from 1860
to 1900. 3 Nevertheless, employment in cotton textiles, and in primary iron and steel
manufacturing grew rapidly then.
The growth of manufacturing relative to agriculture surely involves some general
equilibrium considerations, perhaps involving surplus labor in the agricultural sector (Lewis
1954). But at the industry level, rapid labor productivity growth along with job growth must
mean a rapid growth in the equilibrium level of demand — the amount consumed must

2

Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008) also propose an explanation based on differences in capital deepening.

increase sufficiently to offset the labor-saving effect of technology. For example, although
labor productivity in cotton textiles increased nearly 30-fold during the 19th century,
consumption of cotton cloth increased 100-fold. The inverted U thus seems to involve an
interaction between productivity growth and demand.
A long-standing literature sees sectoral shifts arising from differences in the income
elasticity of demand. Clark (1940), building on earlier statistical findings by Engel (1857) and
others, argued that necessities such as food, clothing and housing have income elasticities
that are less than one (see also Boppart 2014; Comin, Lashkari and Mestieri 2015;
Kongsamut, Rebelo and Xie 2001; and Matsuyama 1992 for more general treatments of
nonhomothetic preferences). The notion behind “Engel’s Law” is that demand for
necessities becomes satiated as consumers can afford more, so that wealthier consumers
spend a smaller share of their budgets on necessities. Similarly, this tendency is seen playing
out dynamically. As nations develop and their incomes grow, the relative demand for
agricultural and manufactured goods falls and, with labor productivity growth, relative
employment in these sectors falls even faster.
This explanation is also incomplete, however. While a low income elasticity of
demand might explain late 20th century deindustrialization, it does not easily explain the
rising demand for some of the same goods during the 19th century. By this account, cotton
textiles are a necessity with an income elasticity of demand less than one. Yet, during the 19th
century, the demand for cotton cloth grew dramatically as incomes rose. That is, cotton
cloth must have been a “luxury” good then. Nothing in the theory explains why the
supposedly innate characteristics of preferences for cloth changed.
It would seem that the nature of demand changed over time. Matsuyama (2002)
introduced a model where the income elasticity of demand changes as incomes grow (see
5

also Foellmi and Zweimueller 2008). In this model, consumers have hierarchical preferences
for different products. As their incomes grow, consumer demand for existing products
saturates and they progressively buy new products further down the hierarchy. Given
heterogeneous incomes that grow over time, this model can explain the inverted U pattern.
It also corresponds, in a highly stylized way, to the sequence of growth across industries seen
in Figure 1.
Yet, there are two reasons that this model might not fit the evidence very well for
individual industries. First, the timing of the growth of these industries seems to have much
more to do with particular innovations that began eras of accelerated productivity growth
than with the progressive saturation of other markets. Cotton textile consumption soared
following the introduction of the power loom to U.S. textile manufacture in 1814; steel
consumption grew following the U.S. adoption of the Bessemer steelmaking process in 1856,
and Henry Ford’s assembly line in 1913 initiated rapid growth in motor vehicles.
Second, there is the general problem of looking at the income elasticity of demand as
the main driver of structural change: the data suggests that prices were often far more
consequential for consumers than income. From 1810 to 2011, real GDP per capita rose
thirtyfold, but output per hour in cotton textiles rose over eight hundredfold; inflationadjusted prices correspondingly fell by three orders of magnitude. Similarly, from 1860 to
2011, real GDP per capita rose seventeenfold, but output per hour in steel production rose
over 100 times and prices fell by a similar proportion. The literature on structural change has
focused on the income elasticity of demand, often ignoring price changes. Yet these
magnitudes suggest that low prices might substantially contribute to any satiation of demand.
I develop a model that includes both income and price effects on demand, allowing both to
have changing elasticities over time.
6

The inverted U pattern in industry employment can be explained by a declining price
elasticity of demand. If we assume that rapid productivity growth generated rapid price
declines in competitive product markets, then these price declines would be a major source
of demand growth. During the rising phase of employment, equilibrium demand had to
increase proportionally faster than the fall in prices in response to productivity gains. During
the deindustrialization phase, demand must have increased proportionally less than prices.
Below I obtain estimates that show the price elasticity of demand falling in just this manner.
To understand why this may have happened, it is helpful to return to the origins of
the notion of a demand curve. Dupuit (1844) recognized that consumers placed different
values on goods used for different purposes. A decrease in the price of stone would benefit
the existing users of stone, but consumers would also buy stone at the lower price for new
uses such as replacing brick or wood in construction or for paving roads. In this way, Dupuit
showed how the distribution of uses at different values gives rise to what we now call a
demand curve, allowing for a calculation of consumer surplus.
This paper proposes a parsimonious explanation for the rise and fall of industry
employment based on a simple model where consumer preferences follow such a
distribution function. The basic intuition is that when most consumers are priced out of the
market (the upper tail of the distribution), demand elasticity will tend to be high for many
common distribution functions. When, thanks to technical change, price falls or income rises
to the point where most consumer needs are met (the lower tail), then the price and income
elasticities of demand will be small. The elasticity of demand thus changes as technology
brings lower prices to the affected industries and higher income to consumers generally.

7

Model
Simple model of the Inverted U
Consider production and consumption of two goods — cloth and a general
composite good — in autarky. The model will focus on the impact of technology on
employment in the textile industry under the assumption that the output and employment in
the textile industry are only a small part of the total economy.
Production
Let the output of cloth be 𝑞𝑞 = 𝐴𝐴 ∙ 𝐿𝐿, where L is textile labor and A is a measure of

technical efficiency. Changes in A represent labor-augmenting technical change. Note that

this is distinct from those cases where automation completely replaces human labor. Bessen
(2016) shows that such cases are rare, and that the main impact of automation consists of
technology augmenting human labor.
I initially assume that product and labor markets are competitive so that the price of
cloth is
(1)

𝑝𝑝 = 𝑤𝑤 ⁄𝐴𝐴,

where w is the wage. Below, I will test whether this assumption holds in the cotton and steel
industries.
Then, given a demand function, 𝐷𝐷(𝑝𝑝), equating demand with output implies
(2)

𝐷𝐷(𝑝𝑝) = 𝑞𝑞 = 𝐴𝐴 ∙ 𝐿𝐿

or

𝐿𝐿 = 𝐷𝐷(𝑝𝑝)/𝐴𝐴.

We seek to understand whether an increase in A, representing technical
improvement, results in a decrease or increase in employment L. That depends on the price

8

elasticity of demand, 𝜖𝜖, assuming income is constant. Taking the partial derivative of the log
of (2) with respect to the log of A,

𝜕𝜕 ln 𝐿𝐿 𝜕𝜕 ln 𝐷𝐷(𝑝𝑝) 𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑝𝑝
=
− 1 = 𝜖𝜖 − 1,
𝜕𝜕 ln 𝐴𝐴
𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑝𝑝 𝜕𝜕 ln 𝐴𝐴

𝜖𝜖 ≡ −

𝜕𝜕 ln 𝐷𝐷(𝑝𝑝)
𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑝𝑝

If the demand is elastic (𝜖𝜖 > 1), technical change will increase employment; if demand is

inelastic (𝜖𝜖 < 1), jobs will be lost. In addition to this price effect, changing income might
also affect demand as I develop below.
Consumption
Now, consider a consumer’s demand for cloth. Suppose that the consumer places
different values on different uses of cloth. The consumer’s first set of clothing might be very
valuable and the consumer might be willing to purchase even if the price is quite high. But
cloth draperies might be a luxury that the consumer would not be willing to purchase unless
the price is modest. Following Dupuit (1844) and the derivation of consumer surplus used in
industrial organization theory, these different values can be represented by a distribution
function. Suppose that the consumer has a number of uses for cloth that each give her value
v, no more, no less. The total yards of cloth that these uses require can be represented as f(v).
That is, when the uses are ordered by increasing value, f(v) is a scaled density function giving
the yards of cloth for value v. If we suppose that our consumer will purchase cloth for all
uses where the value received exceeds the price of cloth, 𝑣𝑣 > 𝑝𝑝, then for price p, her demand
is

𝐷𝐷(𝑝𝑝) = � 𝑓𝑓(𝑧𝑧)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 1 − 𝐹𝐹(𝑝𝑝),
𝑝𝑝

𝑝𝑝

𝐹𝐹(𝑝𝑝) ≡ � 𝑓𝑓(𝑧𝑧)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

9

where I have normalized demand so that maximum demand is 1. With this normalization, f
is the density function and F is the cumulative distribution function. I assume that these
functions are continuous, with continuous derivatives for p>0.
The total value she receives from these purchases is then the sum of the values of all
uses purchased,
∞

𝑈𝑈(𝑝𝑝) = � 𝑧𝑧 ∙ 𝑓𝑓(𝑧𝑧)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 .
𝑝𝑝

This quantity measures the gross consumer surplus and can be related to the standard
measure of net consumer surplus used in industrial organization theory (Tirole 1988, p. 8)
after integrating by parts:
∞

∞

∞

𝑈𝑈(𝑝𝑝) = � 𝑧𝑧 ∙ 𝑓𝑓(𝑧𝑧)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = � 𝑧𝑧 ∙ 𝐷𝐷′(𝑧𝑧)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝑝𝑝 ∙ 𝐷𝐷(𝑝𝑝) + � 𝐷𝐷(𝑧𝑧)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.
𝑝𝑝

𝑝𝑝

𝑝𝑝

In words, gross consumer surplus equals the consumer’s expenditure plus net consumer
surplus. I interpret U as the utility that the consumer derives from cloth. 4
The consumer also derives utility from consumption of the general good, x, and
from leisure time. Let the portion of time the consumer works be l so that leisure time is
1 – l. Assume that the utility from these goods is additively separable from the utility of cloth
so that total utility is
𝑈𝑈(𝑣𝑣) + 𝐺𝐺(𝑥𝑥, 1 − 𝑙𝑙)

where G is a concave differentiable function. The consumer will select v, x, and l to
maximize total utility subject to the budget constraint

Note that in order to use this model of preferences to analyze demand over time, one of two assumptions
must hold. Either there are no significant close substitutes for cloth or the prices of these close substitutes
change relatively little. Otherwise, consumers would have to take the changing price of the potential substitute
into account before deciding which to purchase. If there is a close substitute with a relatively static price, the
value v can be reinterpreted as the value relative to the alternative. Below I look specifically at the role of close
substitutes for cotton cloth, steel, and motor vehicles.

10

𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 ≥ 𝑥𝑥 + 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(𝑣𝑣)

where the price of the composite good is taken as numeraire. The consumer’s Lagrangean
can be written
ℒ(𝑣𝑣, 𝑥𝑥, 𝑙𝑙) = 𝑈𝑈(𝑣𝑣) + 𝐺𝐺(𝑥𝑥, 1 − 𝑙𝑙) + 𝜆𝜆�𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 − 𝑥𝑥 − 𝑝𝑝 ∙ 𝐷𝐷(𝑣𝑣)�.

Taking the first order conditions, and recalling that under competitive markets, 𝑝𝑝 = 𝑤𝑤 ⁄𝐴𝐴,
we get

𝑣𝑣� = 𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙

𝑝𝑝 𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙
= ,
𝑤𝑤 𝐴𝐴

𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙 ≡

𝜕𝜕 𝐺𝐺
.
𝜕𝜕 𝑙𝑙

𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙 represents the marginal value of leisure time and the second equality results from applying
assumption (1). In effect, the consumer will purchase cloth for uses that are at least as

valuable as the real cost of cloth valued relative to leisure time. Note that if 𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙 is constant,

the effect of prices and the effect of income are inversely related. This means that the price
elasticity of demand will equal the income elasticity of demand. However, the marginal value
of leisure time might very well increase or decrease with income; for example, if the labor
supply is backward bending, greater income might decrease equilibrium 𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙 so that leisure
time increases. To capture that notion, I parameterize 𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙 = 𝑤𝑤 𝛼𝛼 so that
𝑣𝑣� = 𝑤𝑤 𝛼𝛼 ⁄𝐴𝐴 = 𝑤𝑤 𝛼𝛼−1 𝑝𝑝,

(3)

𝐷𝐷(𝑣𝑣�) = 1 − 𝐹𝐹(𝑣𝑣�).

Elasticities
Using (3), the price elasticity of demand holding wages constant solves to
𝜖𝜖 = −

𝜕𝜕 ln 𝐷𝐷 𝜕𝜕 ln 𝐷𝐷(𝑣𝑣�) 𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑣𝑣�
𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(𝑣𝑣�)
=
=
𝑤𝑤 𝛼𝛼−1
𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑝𝑝
𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑣𝑣� 𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑝𝑝 1 − 𝐹𝐹(𝑣𝑣�)

and the income (wage) elasticity of demand holding price constant is
𝜌𝜌 =

𝜕𝜕 ln 𝐷𝐷 𝜕𝜕 ln 𝐷𝐷(𝑣𝑣�) 𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑣𝑣�
=
= (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜖𝜖.
𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑤𝑤
𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑣𝑣� 𝜕𝜕 ln 𝑤𝑤
11

These elasticities change with prices and wages or alternatively with changes in labor
productivity, A. The changes can create an inverted-U in employment. Specifically, if the
price elasticity of demand, 𝜖𝜖, is greater than 1 at high prices and lower than 1 at low prices,

then employment will trace an inverted U as prices decline with productivity growth. At high
prices relative to income, productivity improvements will create sufficient demand to offset
job losses; at low prices relative to income, they will not.
A preference distribution function with this property can generate a kind of industry
life cycle as technology continually improves labor productivity over a long period of time.
An early stage industry will have high prices and large unmet demand, so that price decreases
result in sharp increases in demand; a mature industry will have satiated demand so further
price drops only produce an anemic increase in demand.
A necessary condition for this pattern is that the price elasticity of demand must
increase with price over some significant domain, so that it is smaller than 1 at low prices but
larger than 1 at high prices. It turns out that many distribution functions have this property.
This can be seen from the following propositions (proofs in the Appendix):
Proposition 1. Single-peaked density functions. If the distribution density function, f,
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
has a single peak at 𝑝𝑝 = 𝑝𝑝̅, then 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 ≥ 0 ∀ 𝑝𝑝 < 𝑝𝑝̅.
Proposition 2. Common distributions. If the distribution is normal, lognormal,
exponential or uniform, there exists a 𝑝𝑝∗ such that for 0 < 𝑝𝑝 < 𝑝𝑝∗ , 𝜖𝜖 < 1, and for
𝑝𝑝∗ < 𝑝𝑝, 𝜖𝜖 > 1.

These propositions suggest that the model of demand derived from distributions of

preferences might be broadly applicable. The second proposition is sufficient to create the
inverted U curve in employment as long as the price starts above 𝑝𝑝∗ and declines below it.

12

Empirical estimates
This very simple model does not consider numerous factors that might influence
demand. It does not consider the role of close substitutes or the effect of the business cycle
on demand. New technology might create new products that generate new demand, altering
the distribution, or new substitutes that decrease demand. Global trade might alter
downstream industries, affecting the demand for intermediate goods such as cloth or steel.
Nevertheless, the model appears to predict actual demand over a historical timeframe
reasonably well.
Assuming that the preference distribution is lognormal, I estimate the per capita
demand functions for these three commodities (see Bessen 2017 for details). The model fits
the data quite closely, realizing R-squareds of .982 or higher. Using these predictions, I
estimate the price elasticity of demand at each end of the estimation sample:

The demand was initially highly elastic, but became highly inelastic.
Using estimated per capita demand, labor demand can be calculated incorporating
population size, import penetration, labor productivity and hours worked. These estimates
are shown as the solid lines in Figure 1. The estimates appear to be accurate over long
periods of time. There are notable drops in employment during the Great Depression and
excess employment in motor vehicles during World War II. Finally, employment falls below
the estimates when globalization takes a bite out of employment in textiles after 1995, and
steel after 1982.

13

Thus, even though this overly simple model does not account for all of the factors
that affect demand, it nevertheless provides a succinct explanation of the inverted U in
employment in these manufacturing industries.

Implication for AI
The importance of demand
Although the model presented here appears to provide a good explanation for how
demand mediated the impact of technology in the past, what is the relevance of this analysis
for new technologies? There is, of course, no guarantee that AI or other new technologies
will be applied in markets with preference distributions similar to those of the textile, steel
and automotive industries.
The relevance of this history is more general. Specifically, the responsiveness of
demand is key to understanding whether major new technologies will decrease or increase
employment in affected industries. Productivity-enhancing technology will increase industry
employment if product demand is sufficiently elastic. If the price elasticity of demand is
greater than one, the increase in demand will more than offset the labor saving effect of the
technology. And demand will likely be sufficiently elastic if the technology is addressing large
unmet needs affecting people with diverse preferences and uses for the technology. This
situation corresponds to the upper tail of the distribution function. If, on the other hand, AI
is targeted at more satiated markets, then jobs will be lost in the affected industries, although
not necessarily in the economy as a whole.
The pace of change of a new technology is not sufficient by itself to determine the
impact of that technology on employment. For example, a common view holds that faster
technical change is more likely to eliminate jobs. Some people argue that because of Moore’s
14

Law, the rate of change will be fast for AI and this will cause unemployment (Ford 2015).
However, my analysis highlights the importance of demand in mediating the impact of
automation. If demand is sufficiently elastic and AI does not completely replace humans,
then technical change will create jobs rather than destroy them. In this case, a faster rate of
technical change will actually create faster employment growth rather than job losses.
The demand response to AI is, of course, an empirical question and, therefore, an
important part of the AI research agenda.
Research agenda
To understand the interaction between AI and demand over the next 10 or 20 years,
empirical researchers will need answers to several specific questions.
First, to what extent will AI replace humans and to what extent will it, instead,
merely augment human capabilities? That is, to what extent will AI completely automate
occupations and to what extent will it, instead, merely automate some, but not all, tasks
performed by an occupation. If humans are completely replaced, demand no longer affects
employment because there isn’t any demand for humans. In the past, despite extensive
productivity growth, technology has almost always only partially automated work. Consider
what happened to the 271 detailed occupations used in the 1950 census by 2010. Most
occupations listed then still exist in some form (sometimes grouped differently) today. Some
occupations were eliminated for a variety of reasons. In many cases, demand for the
occupational services declined (e.g., boardinghouse keepers); in some cases, demand declined
because of technological obsolescence (e.g., telegraph operators). This, however, is not the
same as automation. In only one case — elevator operators — can the decline and

15

disappearance of an occupation be largely attributed to automation. Nevertheless, this 60year period witnessed extensive automation; it was just mostly partial automation.
This same pattern is likely to be true for AI over the next 10 or 20 years for the
simple reason that although AI can outperform humans on some tasks, today’s AI fails
miserably at other tasks that humans perform. A casual review of current developments
suggests that over the near term AI may be able to completely automate some jobs of drivers
and warehouse workers, but most AI applications are targeted toward automating just some
subset of tasks performed by specific occupations. Nevertheless, a more rigorous empirical
investigation is needed to measure the extent to which AI is bringing or will bring complete
versus partial automation.
To the extent that automation continues to be partial rather than complete in the
near term, demand will be key. This raises a second question: to what extent will the effect of
AI on demand and employment during the next 10 or 20 years be similar to the effect that
AI and computer automation generally had over the last several decades? Computers have
been used to automate work in activities such as accounting and loan making since the
1950s. The first fully automatic loan application system was installed in 1972. In 1987, an
artificial intelligence system was first put into commercial operation in a system used to
detect credit fraud. Since then, AI applications have been used to automate a variety of tasks
in other industries and occupations, such as the electronic discovery of legal documents for
litigation.
This means that we already have some evidence of the effects of AI and computer
automation generally. It does not seem that computer automation or AI has so far led to
significant job losses; the booming market for electronic discovery applications, for instance,
has been associated with an increase in the employment of paralegals. A few studies have
16

made estimates of the employment impact of computer technology (Gaggl and Wright 2017;
Akerman et al. 2015), finding, if anything, a modest increase in employment following
technology adoption. 5 Further studies could deepen our understanding of the impact of
computer automation on employment, and how this impact differs across occupations and
industries.
Also, we need to understand how AI applications in the near future will differ from
those of the recent past. The model above provides a framework to analyze this question. In
particular, to the extent that the new applications target the same services and industries as
did the computer automation of the recent past, then we should expect the elasticity of
demand to remain similar over the next 10 or 20 years, perhaps with a modest decline. That
is, the elasticity of demand is not likely to change very quickly. On the other hand, AI might
introduce entirely new products and services that tap into otherwise unmet needs and wants.
In this case, there may be new and unanticipated sources of employment growth. Research
can help determine the extent of change in the sorts of applications, occupations and
industries affected by new AI applications that are also addressed by existing technologies.
To the extent that AI creates wholly new applications, prediction will be more difficult.
Indeed, in the past, predictions about technological unemployment have reliably failed to
anticipate major new applications of technology and major new sources of demand.
A critical aspect of this research concerns the unevenness of the potential impact of
AI. While AI might not create overall unemployment in the near future, it will likely
eliminate jobs in some occupations while creating new jobs in others. The need to retrain
and transition workers to new occupations, sometimes in new locations, might be highly
disruptive even though the total employment rate remains high.
5

And, importantly, impacts that differed across skill groups.

17

Finally, it is important to note that this analytical framework and research agenda are
very much limited to the next 10 or 20 years for two reasons. First, beyond a couple of
decades, markets might well become saturated. Suppose, for example, that demand is highly
elastic for many financial, health and other services today so that information technology
increases employment in these markets. If AI rapidly reduces costs or improves the quality
of these services, the elasticity of demand will decline. That is, these markets might see the
kind of reversals in employment growth seen in Figure 1.
Second, in the future, AI might very well be able to completely replace many more
occupations. Then the effect of AI on demand will no longer matter for these occupations.
For now, however, understanding how and where AI affects demand is critical to
understanding employment effects.

Note that the second and third terms in parentheses are positive for 𝑝𝑝 > 0; the first term
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

could be positive or negative. A sufficient condition for 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 ≥ 0 is

(A1)

𝑓𝑓′

𝑓𝑓 1 − 𝐹𝐹

Proposition 1. For a single peaked distribution with mode 𝑝𝑝̅, for 𝑝𝑝 < 𝑝𝑝̅ , 𝑓𝑓 ′ ≥ 0 so that
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

≥ 0.

Proposition 2. For each distribution, I will show that
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
≥ 0,
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

lim 𝜖𝜖 = 0,

𝑝𝑝→0

lim 𝜖𝜖 = ∞.

𝑝𝑝→∞

Taken together, these conditions imply that for sufficiently high price, 𝜖𝜖 > 1, and for a
sufficiently low price, 𝜖𝜖 < 1.
a. Normal distribution
𝑓𝑓(𝑝𝑝) =

1
𝜑𝜑(𝑥𝑥),
𝜎𝜎

𝐹𝐹(𝑝𝑝) = Φ(𝑥𝑥),

𝜖𝜖(𝑝𝑝) =

𝑝𝑝
𝜑𝜑(𝑥𝑥)

𝜎𝜎 (1 − Φ(𝑥𝑥))

𝑥𝑥 ≡

𝑝𝑝 − 𝜇𝜇

where 𝜑𝜑 and Φ are the standard normal density and cumulative distribution functions
respectively. Taking the derivative of the density function,

A well-known inequality for the normal Mills’ ratio (Gordon 1941) holds that for x>0, 6
(A2)
𝑥𝑥 ≤

𝜑𝜑(𝑥𝑥)
.
1 − Φ(𝑥𝑥)

Applying this inequality, it is straightforward to show that (A1) holds for the normal
distribution. This also implies that lim 𝜖𝜖 = ∞. By inspection, 𝜖𝜖(0) = 0.
𝑝𝑝→∞

b. Exponential distribution

Then

𝑓𝑓(𝑝𝑝) ≡ 𝜆𝜆𝑒𝑒 −𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆 ,

𝐹𝐹(𝑝𝑝) ≡ 1 − 𝑒𝑒 −𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆 , 𝜖𝜖(𝑝𝑝) = 𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆,

𝜆𝜆, 𝑝𝑝 > 0.

𝑓𝑓 ′
𝑓𝑓

= −𝜆𝜆 + 𝜆𝜆 = 0
𝑓𝑓 1 − 𝐹𝐹

so (A1) holds. By inspection, 𝜖𝜖(0) = 0 and lim 𝜖𝜖 = ∞.
𝑝𝑝→∞

Cancelling terms and using Gordon’s inequality, this is positive. And taking the limit of
Gordon’s inequality, lim 𝜖𝜖 = ∞. By inspection lim 𝜖𝜖 = 0.
