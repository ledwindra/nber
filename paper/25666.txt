ABSTRACT
We compare the spatial distribution of emissions from Southern California’s pollution-trading
program with that of a counterfactual command-and-control policy. We develop a normatively
significant metric with which to rank the various distributions in a manner consistent with an
explicit well-behaved preference structure. Results suggest trading benefited all demographic
groups and generated a more equitable overall distribution of emissions even after controlling for
its lower aggregate emissions. Upper-income and white demographics had more desirable
distributions relative to low-income and some minority groups under the RECLAIM trading
program, however, and population shifts over time may have undermined anticipated gains for
African Americans.

Tension can exist between the goal of environmental protection and concern for individuals in historically disadvantaged communities. Initially, environmental justice concerns focused on the question of whether permits for
facilities generating hazardous waste were more likely to be issued in poor
or minority neighborhoods (e.g., United Church of Christ, 1987). More recently, focus has shifted to policy mechanisms themselves (Fann et al., 2011;

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

Fowlie et al., 2012).
Traditional performance-based command-and-control air pollution regulations typically allow a regulated source to emit pollution per unit of input
or output up to the amount written in its permit. In efforts to reduce the
cost of environmental protection, recent decades have seen the introduction
of programs that would allow individual sources to increase emissions if they
pay a tax or purchase credits from other sources that reduce emissions.
The distributional question is whether such market-based mechanisms
cause low income and minority populations to be worse off than a system in
which each source has to comply with its own permit. In principle, marketbased mechanisms could cause a reallocation of pollution to low income or
minority neighborhoods for a variety of reasons. It may be economically efficient to do so if marginal control costs in these areas are relatively high.
Alternatively, it is possible that the flexibility inherent in market mechanisms may allow plant managers to make pollution control decisions on the
basis of informal political or discriminatory, rather than purely economic,
motives. More affluent neighborhoods may be more effective at pressuring
plant managers to reduce emissions, for example. Or, managers may experience greater disutility from increasing emissions in white versus minority
neighborhoods (Hamilton, 1995).
There is a large literature showing a correlation between pollution exposure and demographic characteristics such as racial minority or low income
status (see, for example, Ringquist, 2005). Less evidence exists regarding
the relationship between exposure and environmental policy design. Early
work compared anticipated air quality improvements from command-andcontrol policies to baseline levels, generally finding that low income and

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

minority populations tended to receive larger benefits (Harrison and Rubinfeld, 1978; Gianessi et al., 1979). Fowlie et al. (2012) found no evidence that
emissions sources surrounded by minority and low income populations emitted more under a NOx emissions trading program than in a counterfactual
command-and-control policy. Using the same emissions data, but looking
at air pollution dispersion models rather than simple circles around facilities, Grainger and Ruangmas (2018) find limited evidence suggesting that
facilities “upwind” from African American communities may have higher
emissions with a market based instrument.
The question is not merely academic, particularly in light of recent policies
to reduce CO2 emissions. One of the most cost effective means of reducing
emissions is to move production from more to less carbon intensive sources,
e.g., shifting electricity generation from coal to natural gas burning power
plants. Although CO2 itself is not toxic in atmospheric concentrations, fossil
fuel combustion typically generates local co-pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) and nitrogen oxides (NOx ) that are. Thus, the concern
is that the facilities that increase production may be disproportionately
located in poor or minority communities. A California court temporarily
stayed the state’s fledgling carbon emission trading program due to a suit
on such grounds.1
The literature uses many descriptive statistical tools (group means, correlations, etc.) to consider whether a particular distribution of environmental
harm poses an environmental justice problem (Maguire and Sheriff, 2011).
None of these measures are normatively significant, in the sense that there
is not a relationship between a distributional ranking based on their math1

ematical value and the way that a “reasonable” human being would rank
them (Blackorby et al., 1999).
Here, we take an approach commonly used in the income distribution literature (Lambert, 2001). We begin with a well-behaved preference structure.
From that we derive a mathematical function for a given distribution of environmental outcomes such that its value is consistent with the underlying
preference ordering. A key advantage of this normative approach is that it
allows us to make statements such as distribution A is better than B based
on a transparent set of explicit value judgements.
Comparative assessment of distributional implications of policy alternatives is complicated by the lack of an observed counterfactual. Similarly to
Fowlie et al. (2012), we use matching techniques to generate counterfactual
emissions outcomes. Specifically, we evaluate the distributional implications
of the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) program implemented in Southern California’s South Coast Air Quality Monitoring District (SCAQMD). RECLAIM created a market-based program for reducing
industrial NOx emissions. Using data from both RECLAIM participants and
firms operating under a traditional command-and-control regime we predict
the counterfactual emissions of participating firms. We then compare actual
to counterfactual emissions patterns to evaluate the distributional implications of the two regulatory approaches.
Our approach provides answers to the following types of questions. At
baseline, did disadvantaged demographic groups in the SCAQMD have a
worse distribution of NOx pollution from regulated facilities than the population as a whole? Did the distribution for these groups improve after
the RECLAIM program came into effect? Would they have been better off

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

5

under traditional command-and-control regulation? Did population sorting
over time undermine benefits of RECLAIM for disadvantaged demographic
groups? In short, did the efficiency of the RECLAIM program come at the
expense of historically disadvantaged socio-economic groups?
Although to our knowledge ours is the first study to apply welfare concepts
developed in the context of income distribution to analyze environmental
justice concerns, previous research has applied inequality indexes to environmental policy issues.2 To evaluate the equity of proposals to limit GHG
emissions, Heil and Wodon (2000) calculated Gini coefficients for projected
country-level per capita CO2 emissions under various mitigation scenarios.
A related literature (e.g., Fankhauser et al., 1997; Anthoff and Tol, 2010)
combines equity weights with integrated assessment models to calculate international damage from climate change. Millimet and Slottje (2002) calculated Gini coefficients for state and county-level per capita toxic release
exposures to understand whether uniform federal environmental standards
ameliorate disparities in environmental outcomes.
More recently, indexes originally developed for measuring income inequality have been used to compare distributions of pollution outcomes across
individuals at a relatively fine level of spatial disaggregation, typically calculated at the U.S. Census Block Group level. The most common measure
has been the Atkinson inequality index (Levy et al., 2007, 2009; Fann et al.,
2011; Clark et al., 2014), although studies have also employed other measures such as Gini coefficient (Bouvier, 2014; Boyce et al., 2016; Holland
2

Many studies use the related concept of concentration indexes to rank joint distributions of health attributes and socioeconomic status. This approach, however, only applies
to cases in which the latter can be clearly ranked (e.g., income). It less useful for analyzing distributions across categorical variables, such as race, that lack a natural ordering
(Fleurbaey and Schokkaert, 2011).

6

et al., 2019) and Generalized Entropy indexes (Boyce et al., 2016). Unlike
our approach, using inequality indexes to compare distributions with different means has the disadvantage that they are not welfare measures, and
consequently lack normative significance (Kaplow, 2005). In other words, a
person with well-behaved preferences would not necessarily prefer a pollution distribution that has a lower Gini coefficient or Atkinson index.
We find little evidence to suggest an environmental justice concern regarding the emissions from RECLAIM facilities during the 1990–1993 baseline
period. The distributions of exposures for whites and individuals from households above twice the poverty line are worse than the distributions for all
other demographic groups. Both the counterfactual command-and-control
policy and RECLAIM changed the relative ordering of demographic groups.
Although the black demographic has the most desirable exposure distribution under all three scenarios, under RECLAIM the white distribution
is preferable to the Hispanic distribution. With respect to income, under
RECLAIM the wealthiest group has the most desirable distribution.
Despite this shift in relative positions across groups, each individual group
is better off under RECLAIM than at baseline or command and control. This
improvement is due to both a reduction in average exposure levels as well
as a reduction in the inequity of the dispersion in exposure levels within
groups. That is, there is no evidence to suggest that the gains accruing to
RECLAIM for one demographic group came at the expense of any other
group, nor that average improvements within a group came at the expense
of increased “hotspots” within the group.
The paper is organized as follows. Section I provides a brief comparison
between the RECLAIM program and command-and-control policies (for a

Section II describes the microeconomic foundation for the social evaluation
functions used to rank emission distributions. Section III describes the raw
emissions and demographic data and the statistical techniques used to calculate counterfactual emissions. Section IV presents analytical results, and
Section V offers concluding comments.
I.

California’s Regional Clean Air Incentives Market

Air quality regulation in the Los Angeles basin falls under the jurisdiction of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. In 1989, in an
attempt to reduce some of the highest smog (ozone) levels in the country,
SCAQMD introduced strict NOx emission control standards for stationary
sources (NOx is a precursor pollutant to ozone). At the federal level, an innovation in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments allowed local regulators to
use market based mechanisms to attain ozone ambient air quality standards.
SCAQMD took advantage of these provisions to replace 40 prescriptive
rules with the RECLAIM market based incentive program. Under RECLAIM, facilities were granted a limited quantity of RECLAIM trading
credits (RTCs) based on historical fuel consumption and production technology characteristics. Each credit entitled the owner to emit one pound of
NOx emissions during a 12-month period. From the program’s inception in
1994, SCAQMD gradually reduced the total annual supply of RTCs such
that by 2003 aggregate emissions would be equivalent to the target emissions level hoped to be achieved by the command-and-control requirements
that RECLAIM replaced.
The program initially included almost all facilities in the region with an-

8

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

nual NOx or SO2 emissions of four tons or more (public facilities were not
included). The 392 facilities initially included in RECLAIM comprised over
65 percent of stationary source NOx emissions in SCAQMD (Zerlauth and
Schubert, 1999). During the California electricity crisis, power plants dramatically increased their demand for RTCs leading to a price spike and
some noncompliance. RECLAIM rules were subsequently amended in 2001
to remove 14 power producing facilities from the market, instead requiring
them to install pollution control devices. We exclude these electric plants
from the analysis.
During the early years of the program there was an excess of RTCs, such
that only after 1999 did the aggregate “cap” bind (SCAQMD, 2001). The
effects of the early RTC surplus were unlikely to affect later years, however, since the credits could not be banked, i.e., they were only valid in the
designated year.
II.

Ranking NOx distributions

The fundamental question of interest is determining the relative desirability of pollution distributions arising from different policy scenarios. To do
so, we make the standard assumption that individuals attach utility to the
outcome (pollution exposure) not the magnitude of the change in outcomes
between policy scenarios (Bernoulli, 1738). A first step, therefore requires
specifying a relationship between NOx emissions, measured in tons per year,
and individual welfare.
The primary goal of the RECLAIM program was to reduce NOx emissions.
NOx are created when extremely high temperatures cause atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen to react with each other. Common manmade sources are

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

9

fossil fuel-fired industrial boilers and internal combustion engines.
Epidemiological evidence suggests that NOx directly affects human health
via the respiratory system (U.S. EPA, 2008). NOx emissions indirectly affect human health by contributing to the formation of ground level ozone
and PM2.5 . Ozone is created by a photochemical reaction between NOx ,
atmospheric volatile organic compounds and sunlight. NOx reacts with atmospheric ammonia to create components of PM2.5 .
There is sufficient uncertainty about the direct health impact of NOx that
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not estimate these
impacts when quantifying the benefits of NOx reduction. The relationship
between ozone, PM2.5 , and human health is sufficiently well documented,
however, that the EPA routinely monetizes national benefits from a given
reduction in NOx emissions via these indirect channels in its regulatory
benefit-cost analysis (e.g., U.S. EPA, 2015).
Ideally, we would be able to trace a clear link between a unit of NOx
emissions from a particular source and an individual’s health at a given
location. To do so would require identifying the individual vulnerability to
changes in exposure levels caused by changes in ambient NOx concentrations
arising from a marginal ton of NOx emissions from a particular source. We
would similarly need to estimate individual health impacts from changes in
ozone and PM2.5 concentrations corresponding to the NOx emissions.
There is considerable uncertainty in each of these steps. Models can disagree sharply even in predicting NOx dispersion. The Hybrid Single Particle
Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model used by Grainger and
Ruangmas (2018), for example, generates significant NOx dispersion in areas
50 miles from a source, whereas the ICST3 model used by Lejano and Hirose

10

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

(2005) shows dispersion tapering off within 3 miles. Schlenker and Walker
(2016) find a similar result regressing airport impacts on monitored NO2
levels, with marginal effects reducing substantially 3–6 miles downwind.
Moreover, the factors involved in time and place of ozone and PM2.5 creation are extremely complex, as the process depends on sunlight, wind speed
and direction, elevation, ambient temperature, and concentrations of various
atmospheric chemicals. In some cases, for example, increases in NOx can actually reduce ozone concentrations (Jacob, 1999). Combined with a lack of a
clear dose-response function for NOx health impacts, it is therefore difficult
to estimate changes in the geographical distribution of these chemicals and
their ensuing health effects arising from a change in NOx emissions from a
particular source with a reasonable degree of precision.
We take a different approach, viewing NOx emissions as a proxy for undesirable, yet not well understood, adverse health impacts from RECLAIM
facilities. We are agnostic regarding whether these impacts arise from NOx
itself, ozone, PM2.5 , or other unmeasured air toxics, such as heavy metals,
that may be emitted in the combustion process that creates NOx . We assume that a representative individual believes that these health damages
increase with the tons of NOx emitted by nearby facilities, where nearby is
defined as within 3 km of her home.
We also examine sensitivity to two alternative dispersion models. Given
the prevailing wind direction in most of the region (see figures in Lejano
and Hirose, 2005; Schlenker and Walker, 2016; Grainger and Ruangmas,
2018), we consider a specification that places greater weight on facilities to
the west; rather than assuming a facility’s impacts fall evenly within a circle
of 3 km radius, we model facility emissions as falling within a semicircle of

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

11

1 km radius to the west and a semicircle of 4 km radius to the east. We
also consider a specification using the more sophisiticated HYSPLIT model
results of Grainger and Ruangmas (2018).
Our policy evaluation framework is explicitly welfarist, being based on individual utility. As shown by Kaplow and Shavell (2001), any non-welfarist
method has the potential of preferring a policy that makes everyone worse
off. In particular, we rank pollution distributions based on the preferences
of a hypothetical representative individual. We use the veil of ignorance
(Harsanyi, 1953; Rawls, 1971) to ensure her impartiality. That is, the rankings are based on the ex ante preferences of a representative individual who
believes she will randomly receive an ex post outcome from the distribution.
Importantly, we assume that all other characteristics, both internal and
external, are held constant. Consider, for example, a comparison of distributions of pollution for low income and high income demographic groups.
The ranking would be based not on receiving the poor pollution distribution and being poor versus the rich distribution and being rich, but only on
the expected utility of the two pollution distributions, evaluated at a given
reference income. Similarly, we assume that external factors are constant
across the scenarios being evaluated, thus abstracting from possible hedonic
adjustments à la Roback (1982) to wages and housing prices arising from
differences in pollution.
Formally, under a given policy scenario let xn be the NOx emissions received from RECLAIM facilities by census block group n. In our main specification this exposure is the sum of annual emissions from all RECLAIM
facilities within a 3 km radius of the census block centroid. The vector
x = (x1 , x2 , ..., xN )0 ∈ <N
+ denotes NOx exposures for the N census block

12

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

groups. Behind the veil of ignorance, the vector x generated by a given policy
can be framed as an ex ante lottery in which each ex post outcome xn occurs
with a probability πn equal to census block n’s share of the population.
Ranking distributions is then equivalent to determining which lottery
would be preferred by the representative individual. To do so requires imposing structure on the individual’s preferences.
We first impose the Pareto criterion: increasing pollution for at least one
ex post outcome while leaving all others unchanged makes a lottery less
desirable. Suppressing the probability vector, π, let U (x, y) be the ex ante
utility generated by an emissions lottery conditional on a deterministic numeraire good (income) y. The Pareto criterion can then be expressed as
x ≥ x0 ⇐⇒ U (x, y) ≤ U (x0 , y).
As is common in the income distribution literature we also impose that
U is Schur concave in x (e.g., Lambert, 2001). Schur concavity implies that
transferring a unit of pollution from a low exposure ex post outcome to a
high exposure outcome makes a lottery less desirable, i.e., a mean-preserving
regressive reallocation of pollution does not increase welfare. It is consistent
with the representative individual being risk averse.
In addition to evaluating the desirability of an emissions distribution over
the total population, we are interested in evaluating the relative desirability
of emissions distributions of demographic groups within the population. In
this context, it is useful to be able to rank the pollution distributions of
policies A and B for a demographic group independently of the outcomes
of these policies for another group. This property requires a separability
assumption for the individual’s preferences by demographic groups.
This separability in demographic groups assumption can be stated as fol-

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

13

lows. Let xd denote the vector of outcomes corresponding to individuals in
demographic group d, and x−d denote the vector of outcomes for individuals outside the group. Then U (x, y) can be expressed U (xd , x−d , y). Without
further structure, a ranking between alternative distributions for group d depends upon the distributions of outcomes for everyone else. Separability in
population subgroups allows us to express U (x, y) = Ũ (Ud (xd , y), x−d , y).
That is, we can rank changes in xd , the lottery for group d, independently
of the outcomes for all other individuals (Blackorby et al., 1981).
These preference restrictions are sufficient for Generalized Lorenz (GL)
curve dominance (Shorrocks, 1983) to serve as a partial ordering of pollution
distributions for each subgroup and for the population as a whole. GL curves
are generated by plotting the cumulative pollution exposure per capita as
a function of population percentile ranked in decreasing order of exposure.
For a good outcome, the population would be ranked in increasing order,
e.g., from poorest to richest. It is similar to the standard Lorenz curve in
which the cumulative percent outcome is replaced by the cumulative percent
multiplied by the mean. By construction, the height the curve at 100 percent
of the population equals the mean exposure. The shape of the GL curve
reflects both the equity of a distribution (a perfectly equitable distribution
would be ray from the origin) and the level of pollution (all else equal,
higher average pollution levels raise the curve). Distribution A dominates
distribution B if A’s GL curve is somewhere below and nowhere above B’s.3
GL dominance is only a partial ordering since it cannot rank distributions
whose GL curves cross. To evaluate such distributions it is necessary to impose further preference structure. We begin with an assumption that is only
3

This condition is equivalent to second order stochastic dominance (Thistle, 1989).

14

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

implicitly imposed by much of the income distribution literature: separability in utility between consumption of numeraire y and consumption of the
environmental outcome of interest.

Separability in consumption implies that the ex ante utility function U (x, y)
can be expressed as U ∗ (u(x), y). It ensures that the marginal rate of substitution between any two ex post realizations xm and xn , and therefore the
ranking of any lotteries, is independent of the reference income level y. It
is consistent with a marginal utility of y that is decreasing (multiplicatively
separable) or constant (additively separable) in ex post pollution exposure
(Rey and Rochet, 2004). It is not compatible with preferences in which the
marginal utility of y is increasing in ex post exposure, for example if exposure is equivalent to lost consumption (Hammitt, 2013). Evans and Viscusi
(1991) use survey data to explore a similar problem of how marginal utility
of income is affected by health. Their findings are ambiguous, suggesting
that less severe adverse health outcomes may increase the marginal utility of income, while more severe outcomes may decrease it. Multiplicative
separability is commonly assumed in the health economics literature (e.g.,
Garber and Phelps, 1997; Murphy and Topel, 2006).

Although U (·) is measured in utility, preferences over distributions can be
represented by a social evaluation function measured in cardinal units of x,
also independently of y. Let Ξ(x) be the scalar value of pollution exposure
that, if allocated to each individual, would generate the same ex ante utility

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

15

as the actual distribution:
Ξ(x) ≡ {x̃ : U (x̃ · 1, y) = U (x, y)}
= {x̃ : U ∗ (u(x̃ · 1), y) = U ∗ (u(x), y)}
(1)

= {x̃ : u(x̃ · 1) = u(x)} .

The income distribution literature commonly refers to Ξ as the “equally
distributed equivalent” (EDE) value of x (Atkinson, 1970) Note that higher
values of the social evaluation function Ξ(x) correspond to less desirable
pollution distributions. Consequently, Schur concavity of U (·) implies Schur
convexity of Ξ(x) since the latter is increasing, rather than decreasing in
pollution.

We impose that the social evaluation function satisfies translatability:
Ξ(x + λ · 1) = Ξ(x) + λ for any λ ∈ <1 (Blackorby and Donaldson, 1980).
This property implies that the rankings of alternative emissions distributions
are independent of common shifts in background pollution levels. Combined
with separability in demographic groups, translatability requires that u(x)
be specified as the expectation of Pollak (1971) functions for ex post values
of xn (Blackorby and Donaldson, 1980):

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

These assumptions also imply that the social evaluation function satisfies
consistency in aggregation, i.e., rankings of distributions do not change if
the EDE is calculated for the entire population versus calculated for each
demographic group then aggregated (Blackorby and Donaldson, 1980).
The parameter κ can be thought of as a measure of the representative
individual’s aversion to inequality in adverse environmental outcomes. The
elasticity of marginal utility with respect to a change in an individual’s
pollution allocation is κxn . Preferences vary from no aversion to maximin
as κ goes from zero to negative infinity. (For a good, κ would be positive.)
GL dominance and EDEs rank distributions in a way that takes into account both overall pollution levels as well as the equity of the distribution
across the population. It is sometimes of interest to compare the equity
of distributions independently of the overall pollution levels. Suppose, for
example, it were found that historical market-based mechanisms tended to
result in emissions distributions that are less equitable than command-andcontrol regulations. This result might suggest that future market-based policies should be designed to have greater overall pollution reduction than a
command-and-control alternative in order to generate similar benefits.
To evaluate equity in a way consistent with translatability, we employ absolute Lorenz (AL) curves (Moyes, 1987). AL curves effectively de-mean the
GL curves; their height is the difference between height of the respective GL
curve at a given population percentile (the cumulative exposure per capita)
and the height of a ray from the origin to the mean exposure evaluated
at that percentile (the cumulative exposure per capita if everyone were to
receive the mean exposure). A perfectly flat curve along the horizontal axis
would depict a perfectly equal distribution. The curvature represents the

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

17

inequity of the distribution from this ideal, independent of overall average
reductions in pollution. AL dominance occurs if a curve is somewhere below
and nowhere above another. AL dominance is a partial ordering since it
cannot rank distributions whose curves cross.
Analogous to the relationship between EDEs and GL curves, inequality
indexes can be calculated to generate a complete ordering of distributions
whose AL curves intersect. Kolm (1976) defined an absolute income inequality index as the mean minus the EDE. For a bad, however, the EDE is
greater the mean. To ensure I(x) increases as the distribution becomes less
equal, we use this alternative specification:

(4)

I(x) ≡ Ξ(x) −

N
X

xn π n .

n=1

The index value indicates the maximum increase in per capita emissions exposure the representative individual would accept to replace the
actual distribution with a perfectly equal distribution. It enables analysis
of whether an improvement in average emissions levels comes at the cost of
increased disparity of outcomes, e.g., reducing emissions at relatively clean
sources while exacerbating emission hot spots. The translatability assumption of u(x) implies that I(x) is an index of absolute inequality. That is,
the measured level of inequality is unaffected by an arbitrary common background pollution level λ: I(x) = I(x + λ · 1) for any λ ∈ <1 .
The conditions imposed on u(x) also allow calculation of an index of intergroup inequality,

18

in which πd and Ξd (xd ) are the population share and EDE pollution exposure levels corresponding to each of the D groups. It measures the amount by
which total per capita pollution exposure would need to be reduced to move
from a distribution in which each member of the population receives the
EDE value of the actual distribution to an unequal distribution that generates that allocates to each member of a demographic group the EDE value of
the group’s actual distribution. By construction the three distributions (actual, everyone receives the overall EDE, everyone receives her demographic
group’s EDE) all generate the same expected utility. The higher the requisite exposure reduction, the greater the inter-group inequality (for greater
detail in the context of income distribution, see Blackorby et al., 1981).

Recently, several studies have used income inequality indexes to compare
distributions of environmental outcomes. The inequality indexes typically
used in this literature, the Atkinson index (Levy et al., 2007, 2009; Fann
et al., 2011; Clark et al., 2014), the Gini coefficient (Boyce et al., 2016),
and the Generalized Entropy index (Boyce et al., 2016), are all indexes of
relative inequality. For these, an equiproportional increase in pollution for
all individuals does not increase inequality.

While relative indexes are convenient for comparing nominal incomes from
different time periods or across countries with different currencies, they are
less justified for measuring inequality of pollution exposure. It seems unsatisfactory for a distribution with individuals exposed to trivial amounts
of pollution, say 0.1 tons and 0.001 tons, to be as equitable as one with
exposures of 0.1 ton and 10 tons. For the index defined in Eq. (4), such proportional increases in pollution increase measured inequality (Kolm, 1976).

Data

Emissions and industrial classification for NOx emitting facilities come
from the California Air Quality Resources Board (ARB). California law
requires polluting facilities to report emissions to their local Air Quality
Management District, and the ARB maintains a database of these reports
(Fowlie et al., 2012). We use these data to calculate emissions for two periods: the 1990–1993 pre-RECLAIM period (period 1) and the 2004–2005
period in which RECLAIM was fully implemented (period 2). Only the 212
facilities reporting emissions in both periods are included in the analysis.
We use a matching algorithm similar to that employed by Fowlie et al.
(2012) to calculate counterfactual estimates for what NOx emissions would
have been had facilities been regulated under command-and-control rather
than RECLAIM. Our approach consists of four steps. First, for each RECLAIM facility we generate a pool of potential controls from non-RECLAIM
facilities of the same industrial classification in California ozone nonattainment areas subject to command-and-control regulation. Second, from
this pool we select the three nearest neighbors: those facilities whose preRECLAIM period emissions are closest to those of the RECLAIM facility. Third, we calculate the average percent change in emissions for these
matched controls. Fourth, we apply this percent change to the RECLAIM
facility’s period 1 emissions to generate the period 2 counterfactual.4
Table 1 summarizes actual and counterfactual emissions data for the RECLAIM facilities over the two periods. Actual emissions correspond to emissions under the RECLAIM program, and counterfactual emissions corre4
Our approach differs from Fowlie et al. (2012) by using percent, rather than absolute,
changes to estimate counterfactual emissions. We do this to avoid negative predicted
emissions for some facilities.

spond to the emissions that would have occurred under command and control as estimated by the matching procedure. The table shows that both
policy scenarios resulted in a decline in both total emissions and the dispersion of emissions relative to the baseline. The RECLAIM program, however,
resulted in substantially lower emissions than the counterfactual, and with
lower dispersion across facilities.
Block group demographic data come from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Censuses. The affected population analyzed here consists of all individuals living
in a census block group in the SCAQMD. We divide this population along
race/ethnicity and income. The Hispanic ethnicity consists of all individuals who self-report as being Hispanic, regardless of their race. The Black,
White and Other race categories consist of individuals who self-report as
those races, but do not report as Hispanic. Individual income is reported
by the Census relative to the poverty line. We use three classifications, belonging to a household below the poverty line, between one and two times
the poverty line, and more than two times the poverty line (the latter is the
highest income category reported in the Census).

Table 2 reveals substantial demographic changes between the two decennial censuses. Although total population increased by about 10 percent, the
White population fell and the Black population remained roughly constant.
The Hispanic population grew significantly, overtaking White as the largest
group. All three income categories grew during this period, with the above
2 times the poverty line group growing the slowest.
To analyze the impact of neighborhood demographics on facility emissions,
Fowlie et al. (2012) use the common tactic of taking the facility as the unit
of analysis and calculating demographic information for surrounding areas
within a given radius. That approach answers the question of how facility RECLAIM emissions can be predicted by demographics of surrounding
communities. Here, we take the opposite approach, basing our analysis on
individuals. This approach answers the question of how a given demographic

is affected by RECLAIM. We aggregate emissions from all facilities within
3 km of the block group centroid to calculate cumulative stationary source
NOx emission exposure for each individual in a given census block group.
Figure 1 depicts kernel density functions representing the distribution of
cumulative emission exposure over census block groups for each policy scenario. Cumulative emissions are the total annual average emissions from
all RECLAIM facilities within 3 km of a census block group (census block
groups with zero exposure from RECLAIM facilities are not included in the
diagrams). Consistent with the facility-level data presented in Table 1, the
figure shows a leftward shift in the distribution under both the RECLAIM
and counterfactual command-and-control policies relative to the Period 1
baseline. This shift suggests that the RECLAIM emissions reductions did
not come at the expense of creating pollution hotspots. To the contrary, the
cumulative emissions experienced by the most exposed block groups falls
from 4000 tons under the baseline to just over 1000 tons under RECLAIM.

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

23

These diagrams do not, however, indicate how many individuals of each
demographic group live in the affected block groups. Normatively ranking
emissions distributions requires such individual-level information.

Using individuals as the unit of analysis allows us to analyze welfare implications of emissions distributions in a way that facility or census-block
level analysis does not. Figure 2 illustrates another potential importance of
this distinction in the context of environmental justice. Consider three facilities, two identical large emitters and one small. Let the circles represent
a 3 km radius from each facility, and “P” and “R” represent predominantly
poor and rich census blocks of equal population size. Using a facility-level
unit of analysis might suggest there is no environmental justice concern;
large emitters are surrounded by rich communities, while the small emitter
is be surrounded by the poor community. Using the individual as the unit of
analysis would identify the potential hotspot in which the poor community
is exposed to over twice the cumulative emissions.

In the next section, we apply these methods to actual and counterfactual NOx distributions associated with the RECLAIM program. We begin
by focusing on GL dominance, imposing as few restrictions on preferences
as possible. Although this partial ordering is sufficient for answering several important policy questions, to obtain a complete ordering of pollution
distribution requires more preference structure. To do so, we use Eq. (3)
to calculate EDEs. Finally, recognizing the substantial differences in average emissions between policy options, we calculate inequality indexes, effectively rescaling the counterfactual command-and-control scenario so that it
achieves the same average emissions exposure as RECLAIM.

Results

Here we present rankings of the emissions distributions from the three
policy scenarios (baseline, counterfactual command-and-control, and RECLAIM) across four racial/ethnic groups (Black, White, Hispanic, and Other),
three income groups (below poverty, 1–2 times the poverty line, and more
than twice the poverty line), and the affected population as a whole, using
demographic data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses. We define the affected
population as everyone living in a census block whose centroid is within 3
km of a RECLAIM facility.
The analysis answers four questions relevant to environmental justice concerns with market-based environmental policy instruments. First, did any
demographic group suffer a welfare loss under the RECLAIM program relative to the command-and control-alternative? Second, did the RECLAIM
program favor particular demographic groups in relative terms compared
with command and control? These questions consider both pollution levels and the equity of the pollution distribution. Since there are substantial
differences in total pollution levels between the three scenarios, it may be

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

25

the case that these differences overwhelm the distributional implications of
the policies. To examine the pure distributional implications, we de-mean
the distributions to conduct an absolute Lorenz curve analysis. This analysis answers the following question: Which policy would each demographic
group choose if they each had the same average pollution levels?
The preceding analysis uses demographic information available at the creation of RECLAIM, the 1990 U.S. Census. Over time, geographic concentrations of demographic groups shift. Most of these changes are likely to be
independent of the RECLAIM program. It is possible, however, that some
population shifts may stem in part from changes in environmental quality. Improvements in air quality in some neighborhoods may have increased
property and residential rental values which in turn may have attracted
wealthier households and induced poorer households to leave (see, for example, Banzhaf and Walsh, 2008).
Understanding the impact of such population shifts is important for environmental justice analysis. Even if environmental programs are targeted
towards poor and minority populations, it is possible that population shifts
may undermine their benefits over time. To address this concern, we repeat
the analysis using the 2000 census. By comparing these results to those using
1990 data we can answer the question of whether demographic shifts led to a
less desirable pollution distribution for low income or minority populations.
A key advantage of the GL analysis is that it imposes few restrictions on
preferences. This flexibility comes at the cost not being able to rank distributions whose GL curves cross. GL curves also do not provide information
regarding the equity of distributions across demographic groups. That is, it
may be of interest whether a policy treats demographic groups more or less

A.

Ranking policy outcomes by generalized Lorenz curve dominance

Figure 3 addresses the question of which policy would the representative
individual prefer, conditional on belonging to a given demographic group. It
depicts GL curves for baseline, command-and-control, and RECLAIM NOx
exposure levels by race/ethnicity and income, holding population fixed at
1990 levels. For all demographic groups, RECLAIM GL curves dominate the
counterfactual command-and-control curves which in turn dominate baseline
curves. In other words, there is not evidence to support a concern that
RECLAIM caused low income or minority populations to suffer relative to
pollution levels they would have otherwise experienced. In this case, the GL

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

27

curve ranking is equivalent to ranking distributions based on mean exposure
alone (the height of the curve at the 100th percentile); any differences in
intra-group inequality do not outweigh differences in average exposure.
Our main results were calculated under the assumption that the impact
of NOx emissions are evenly spread within 3 km of each facility. Due to
prevailing westerly winds in the Los Angeles region, there may be concern
that emissions may affect neighborhoods to the east. To address this issue we
generate two alternative exposure patterns. The first assumes that emissions
affect census block groups 4 km to the east but only 1 km to the west of
each facility. The second uses the weighted treatment area generated by
the HYSPLIT model runs used in Grainger and Ruangmas (2018). The
appendix provides details on how we calculated exposure levels based on
these alternate patterns.
Figures 4 and 5 present the results of this sensitivity exercise. The overall relative patterns are similar, although absolute exposure levels differ. For
each demographic group, RECLAIM performs better than the other two scenarios. The Black group consistently has the best distribution, while White
and Hispanic groups have the worst. Only under the HYSPLIT model does
the Hispanic group fare relatively well. The fact that overall exposures are
higher under the west wind dispersion indicates that on average more people
of all demographic groups are affected to the east of facilities than in a symmetric circle. In contrast, the low exposure levels using the HYSPLIT model
arise from the fact that the same emissions are spread over much greater distances, affecting areas with relatively low population density. These results
suggest that adjustments for dispersion patterns are unlikely to substantially
alter the environmental justice implications of RECLAIM.

The maps in figure 6 help explain why the different dispersion models
do not generate qualitatively different environmental justice implications.
Panels (a) and (b) depict the spatial distribution of total emissions generated
by the 3 km radius and HYSPLIT dispersion models. Panels (c) and (d)
respectively depict the distribution of block groups in terms of the share
of population that is low income (less than 2 times the poverty line) and
Hispanic or non-white. The black dots represent the 15 highest emitting
RECLAIM facilities (all of which had over 300 tons average annual emissions
at baseline). To focus attention on emissions that meaningfully affect the
distributional rankings, we do not include the most sparsely populated block
groups (below the 10th percentile in terms of population). The maps show
that under both dispersion models, the most highly affected areas tend to be
the predominantly white and upper income block groups along the coast. In
contrast, the interior portions of Los Angeles most dominated by low income
and minority residents have relatively low exposure.
Despite this pattern of overall improvement, there may be concerns that
RECLAIM exacerbated a disparity between demographic groups. Figure 7
reframes the question, considering which demographic group has the preferred pollution distribution, conditional on a given policy scenario.
Consistent with Figure 6, among racial/ethnic groups Black had the most
desirable distribution of NOx outcomes at baseline, while White had the
least desirable distribution. Although the Black distribution is unambiguously better than the other groups for the two policy scenarios, the relative position of White improves. For the command-and-control scenario,
the White GL curve intersects the Hispanic and Other curves, while for
the RECLAIM scenario the White distribution is strictly preferred to these

is room for concern that RECLAIM left the White group better off than say
the Hispanic group.
A similar story emerges with respect to income groups. Under the baseline
and command-and-control scenarios, individuals below the poverty line had
the most favorable distribution, whereas those whose incomes were more
than twice the poverty line had the worst. Under RECLAIM, the relative

position of the wealthiest appears to have improved.
A potential drawback to using GL curves calculated from 1990 census data
is that neighborhood composition may have changed over time, perhaps even
due to RECLAIM itself. Improvements in air quality in some neighborhoods
may have increased property and residential rental values which in turn may
have attracted wealthier households and induced poorer households to leave
(e.g., Banzhaf and Walsh, 2008). In such cases, GL curves in Figure 7 may
overstate exposure reductions for poor communities. Such sorting would also
complicate the welfare interpretation of GL curves since the rankings hold
all else constant. If individuals living in areas with improved air quality were
to face higher rents, their increase in utility would be lower.

Figure 8 depicts the potential impact of such demographic sorting over
time. It compares RECLAIM GL curves calculated using 1990 versus 2000
census demographic information. This analysis is only suggestive at best,
since we do not have a counterfactual population distribution, i.e., an estimate of 2000 demographic locations in the absence of RECLAIM. We can,
however, observe how actual population shifts in 2000 affected distributions
relative to what would have been predicted using 1990 demographic data.
Sorting does not appear to have played a major role for most demographic
groups. The notable exception is for the Black group. It is the only group
for which benefits predicted by the 1990 census would have over-estimated
the improvements relative to 2000. The data do not allow us to determine
whether this phenomenon was due to obstacles to moving to or remaining in
cleaner neighborhoods or some other cause. Interestingly, however, income

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

does not appear to drive these results since there is no evidence of a similar
shift for any income group.
B.

Ranking policy outcomes by absolute Lorenz curve dominance

One reason that NOx distributions from RECLAIM dominate those for
other policy scenarios is that the overall level of emission exposure is much
lower. It is unclear why RECLAIM had such a strong reduction in pollution
levels since it was intended to achieve the same reductions as the commandand control-regime, but at lower cost.
Fowlie et al. (2012) speculate that cost reductions may have provided
political cover for regulators to achieve more ambitious pollution targets.
Another possible explanation is that regulations are typically limited to reducing emissions on the intensive margin, e.g., emissions per unit of output.
Market-based mechanisms allow sources to meet an absolute quantitative
limit by changing behavior on the extensive margin as well (by reducing
output). Moreover, command-and-control regulations commonly face legal
constraints regarding their maximum stringency. Under the Clean Air Act,
for example, existing major NOx sources in heavily polluted ozone nonattainment areas are subject to reasonably available control technology (RACT)
requirements. RACT is determined on a source-by-source basis, taking into
account “technological and economic feasibility”. Such constraints would
not, in principle, apply to the determination of a sector-wide cap in an
emissions trading program.
Regardless of the reason, it is natural to question whether focusing on
GL curves obscures the larger question of the relative equity of commandand-control and market-based mechanisms behind the differences in total

emissions. An alternative comparison would be between RECLAIM and a
command-and-control policy with the same average exposure.

To address this question, figure 9 presents AL curves. In terms of equity
only, the RECLAIM distribution dominates both the baseline and counterfactual distributions for each demographic group and the for the population
as a whole. Since the AL curves for different demographic groups intersect,
it is necessary to calculate inequality indexes to make comparisons of equity
implications across demographic groups as well as to rank distributions from
the perspective of inter-group equity.

Ranking policy outcomes using equally distributed equivalents and
inequality indexes

Parameter κ in Eq. (2) is a key element in calculating EDEs and inequality
indexes. The choice of κ reflects a value judgement regarding the degree
to which the representative individual is averse to inequality in pollution
lotteries, with higher values corresponding to higher aversion. Using Eq. (2)
the elasticity of marginal utility with respect to pollution is κx.
The literature provides little guidance regarding “reasonable” values of
this elasticity, and such estimation is beyond the scope of this study. In the
context of income distribution, experiments have found values in the neighborhood of 0.25 (Amiel et al., 1999), and the U.S. Census Bureau often
reports results using elasticities of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 (e.g., Jones and Weinberg, 2000; DeNavas-Walt et al., 2012). The only study to our knowledge
that has attempted to estimate this elasticity for an environmental good (a
hypothetical cleanup program) found higher values, with a mean of 0.72 and
median of 2.8 (Cropper et al., 2016).
These studies implicitly assume that preferences are scale invariant, rather
than translatable, meaning that inequality can be expressed with a relative,
rather than absolute index. As such, the calculated elasticity, α, is constant,
rather than varying with exposure as is the case for an absolute index. To
present results for a range of κ that generates elasticities comparable to those
in the above-cited literature we first identify a value of κ that is consistent
with a given constant elasticity α.
To establish a correspondence between an elasticity α and a vector of
elasticities κx, we choose the (negative) value of κ that minimizes the sum
of squared differences between the absolute value of individual elasticities

We use κ(0.50) to calculate the main results, presenting results for κ(0.25)
and κ(0.75) in the appendix. Although EDE and index magnitudes vary
with different parameter values, the ordering remains largely unchanged.
GL curves only enable ordinal ranking of distributions in which they do
not cross. Tables 3 and 4 display the mean, EDE, and inequality index values
for baseline, command-and-control, and RECLAIM NOx exposure distributions using 1990 and 2000 demographics respectively. By further restricting
preferences as in Eq. (2), this table allows cardinal welfare comparisons for
all distributions.
Rankings by EDE in Panel B can only differ from those made by comparing
means in Panel A for cases in which the respective GL curves cross. Under
the command-and-control policy using 2000 demographics, for example, the
distribution for the White group is less desirable than that of the Hispanic
group despite the fact that its average exposure is lower. Looking at the
inequality index values, this relative ranking is due to the fact that the
White distribution is less equitable (index value of 7.4 relative to 3.1 tons).
EDE values enable the determination of whether a policy generated welfare improvements for a given demographic group. They do not, however,
indicate whether improvements come at the cost of increased disparity of
outcomes. Such a concern is particularly relevant for emissions trading programs like RECLAIM. It is possible that the dirtiest facilities may also face

the least pressure to reduce emissions. It may be more costly to retrofit
pollution controls onto older dirtier sources, for example. Or, perhaps communities near these sources lack the power to exert political pressure to
reduce emissions.
The inequality indexes presented in Panel C of Table 3 indicate how RECLAIM impacted the disparity of outcomes. A higher index value signals a
more unequal distribution, independent of the mean. These results suggest
that RECLAIM’s improvement in average exposure relative to commandand-control regulation displayed in Panel A did not come at the expense
of increased disparity of outcomes. Index values for all demographic groups
are the same or slightly lower for RECLAIM using 1990 census data.
There is little change in RECLAIM inequality index values using 2000
census data, suggesting that overall residential sorting played little role in
the dispersion of outcomes within groups. Notably, however, between race
inequality, as calculated by Eq. (5), increased for all scenarios from 1990
demographics to 2000 demographics.

Conclusion

With the implementation of cap and trade programs for carbon emissions
in California and RGGI and recent ballot initiatives for carbon taxes in
Washington state, market-based programs for reducing pollution have received increased attention. The flexibility of these programs relative to a
regulatory command-and-control regime offers cost savings, but also raises
questions about potential distributional implications.
Environmental justice advocacy groups have expressed concern that polluting facilities in low income and minority neighborhoods may respond to

40

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

carbon trading programs by buying permits to increase emissions beyond
what would have been allowed under a command-and-control regime. The
concern is not with CO2 per se, but with other co-pollutants that have
adverse health impacts.
Southern California’s RECLAIM program provides a useful test case for
evaluating such concerns since it replaced command-and-control regulations
with a NOx emissions trading program. There are two key challenges to
rigorously evaluating its distributional impact.
First, it is necessary to generate data for a credible counterfactual emissions scenario. It is not sufficient to compare plant emissions under RECLAIM to emissions prior to the program since many other changes affecting
pollution decisions may have taken place during the intervening years. Instead, we match RECLAIM facilities with similar California facilities outside
the program which continued to be subject to traditional NOx regulations.
We then map actual and counterfactual emissions onto nearby census blocks
whose populations are broken down into various demographic groups.
Second, it is necessary to develop an approach for ranking the alternate
emissions profiles in a way that is consistent with how members of the affected populations would rank them. To do so, we postulate a hypothetical
representative individual and effectively ask her to identify which emissions
distribution she would prefer among the various policy scenarios and demographic groups. To ensure her choices are broadly applicable, we impose
minimal restrictions on her preferences. To ensure her choices are fair, she
ranks distributions from behind a veil of ignorance. When making a choice,
she knows how a given distribution will affect each member of the population, but she doesn’t know how it will affect her specifically. Instead, she will

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

41

be randomly assigned a pollution exposure from the distribution chosen.
The results of this analysis are striking. Each racial/ethnic group and
each income category would prefer the RECLAIM distribution over the corresponding command-and-control alternative. Moreover, there is little evidence to suggest that RECLAIM systematically favored the White or high
income groups over minority or low income groups. Although the pollution
distribution for the White group under RECLAIM was preferable to that
of the Hispanic group, for example, it was worse than that of Black group.
These results are robust to alternative specifications regarding spatial emissions patterns and individual preferences. Moreover, comparing demographic
information from the 2000 to 1990 census suggests that migration patterns
did little to alter these conclusions. Although some of the gains for the
Black group were reduced by demographic changes, it was still better off
with RECLAIM.
One reason RECLAIM performed so well was that total pollution under the program was substantially less than under the counterfactual, regardless how equitably the remaining emissions were distributed across the
population. Looking forward, it would be useful to understand whether the
RECLAIM distribution was more equitably distributed than the counterfactual independently of average pollution levels. Were RECLAIM to generate a
less equitable distribution then there might be cause to require that a future
market-based mechanism be more stringent than an alternative commandand-control regulation in order to compensate for its adverse distributional
implications. Our approach allows us to disentangle overall pollution levels
from the equity of the distribution itself. We find that the RECLAIM distribution was more equitable than the counterfactual for each demographic

Appendix A: Calculating exposure using HYSPLIT weights
Our main specification assumes that the full impact of a facility’s emissions
is felt in census block groups with centroids within a 3 km radius of the
facility. In contrast, Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory
(HYSPLIT) Model used by Grainger and Ruangmas (2018) assumes that
wind and other meteorological and topographical factors spread the impact
out out over a much larger geographic area. In this section, we describe how
we use weights derived from the Grainger and Ruangmas (2018) HYSPLIT
model runs to generate exposure levels in each census block group such that
the aggregate amount of pollution generated is comparable to the levels
generated by our main specification.
HYSPLIT models the impact of each facility’s emissions on ambient NOx
concentrations on a grid of approximate 1 × 1 km cells using meteorological data obtained twice daily from 1990. As described in their technical
appendix Grainger and Ruangmas (2018) apportion these gridded impacts

48

RANKING EMISSIONS DISTRIBUTIONS

to census block groups according to the area of each block group covered by
each grid cell. Pollution concentrations are normalized such that they sum
to 1 for each facility. The block group weight is the proportion of total emissions from facility j accruing to block group i. The authors kindly shared
with us a file containing the weights for each facility-block group pair.

We use the following methodology to use these weights to allocate facility
emissions across census block groups such that the total emissions generated by each facility is comparable with our main 3 km radius dispersion
specification.

Let the index k denote the two dispersion models, with k = M corresponding to our main specification, and k = H corresponding to the HYSPLIT
model. We begin by modeling exposure of individual n in block group i
under dispersion model k, xkin , as the sum of scaled weighted emissions, ej ,
across all facilities (indexed by j):

are the weights calculated by Grainger

and Ruangmas (2018). As detailed below, the scaling factors skj are chosen
to make the aggregate impact of each facility comparable under the two
dispersion model specifications.
The total “effective” emissions within block group i, Eik , are defined to be
