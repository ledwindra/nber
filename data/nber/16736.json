    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper surveys recent empirical studies on the economic impacts of immigration.  The survey first examines the magnitude of immigration as an economic phenomenon in various host countries.  The second part deals with the assimilation of immigrant workers into host-country labor markets and concomitant effects for natives.  The paper then turns to immigration's impact for the public finances of host countries.  The final section considers emerging topics in the study of immigration.  The survey particularly emphasizes the recent experiences of Northern Europe and Scandinavia and relevant lessons from traditional destination countries like the US.\n\n",
