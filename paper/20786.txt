The Long and the Short of It: Sovereign Debt Crises and Debt Maturity
Raquel Fernández and Alberto Martin
NBER Working Paper No. 20786
December 2014, Revised September 2015
JEL No. F33,F34,F36
ABSTRACT
We present a simple model of sovereign debt crises in which a country chooses its optimal mix of
short and long-term bonds subject to standard contracting frictions: the country cannot commit to repay
its debts nor to a specific path of future debt issues, and contracts cannot be made state contingent
nor renegotiated. We show that, in order to reduce incentives to engage in debt dilution, the country
must issue short-term debt. This exposes it to roll-over crises and inefficient repayments. We examine
the effects of alternative restructuring regimes, which either write-down debt or extend its maturity
in the event of crises, and show that both necessarily improve ex ante welfare if they do not decrease
expected payments to creditors during crises. In particular, we show that the way in which these regimes
redistribute payments between short- and long-term creditors, which has been a central point in recent
policy debates, is inconsequential.

Introduction
Sovereign debt is once again at the center stage of the academic and policy debate. This attention has
been largely fueled by the growth of public debt within the Eurozone, which has raised concerns regarding
the ability of the current debt-restructuring framework to deal e¢ ciently with large-scale debt crises. These
concerns were vindicated by the experience of Greece, where the debt restructuring of 2012 is widely perceived
to have come ine¢ ciently late, after years of low growth and increasing o¢ cial indebtedness.
It is against this backdrop that various reforms of the international lending framework are being discussed.1 Broadly speaking, the goal of these proposals is to make it easier for countries to deal e¤ectively
with large stocks of outstanding debt by facilitating restructurings. These proposals have generated a lively
debate. Adherents stress their ex post bene…ts, i.e., they will help countries deal more e¢ ciently with debt
crises. Opponents emphasize instead their ex ante costs, i.e., by making restructuring easier, they will raise
the cost of borrowing. A feature of several proposals is the option of a lighter restructuring –“repro…ling”
–in the form of a lengthening of the maturity of debt that is coming due.2 This has raised the concern that
short-term creditors will be negatively impacted, as they are more likely to be a¤ected by the lengthening
of maturity.3 As short-term debt is thought, for a variety of reasons, to play a critical role in the …nancing
of sovereign debt, any change in its price may have signi…cant repercussions.
Clearly, any reform of the restructuring process a¤ects both the distribution of payo¤s both between
countries and their creditors and also among creditors themselves.

Assessing their merits requires an

analytical framework to address the following questions: What are their costs and bene…ts? What are their
e¤ects on short and long-term interest rates?

How do they a¤ect the likelihood and cost of debt crises?

How will they impact a country’s choice of maturity structure? The sovereign debt literature provides few
models that allow an analysis of policy reforms in a simple and transparent fashion. The objective of this
paper is to provide a simple framework that can be used to address these questions.
We develop a model that incorporates several features that are key to the study of sovereign borrowing.
First, borrowing is subject to standard contracting frictions: debt contracts are non-contingent, they cannot
be renegotiated ex post, and the country is unable to commit to a path of future debt issues or repayment.
Second, the timing of payments can matter.

When there is uncertainty regarding future outcomes, the

refusal by existing creditors to roll-over their debt can result in the country taking measures that impact
negatively on its overall ability to repay and to generate future output. Lastly, the country’s debt maturity
structure is endogenous.
The model features a small-open economy that borrows resources from the international …nancial market

such reform has been prominently advocated by the International Monetary Fund (see IMF 2014b). The call for the

automatic repro…ling of debt also features in a proposal by the Bank of Canada and Bank of England (see Brooke et al (2013)).
3 For an expostision of these arguments, see “Creditors likely losers from IMF Rethink" (Financial Times, 6/4/2013), “IMF
sovereign debt plans in jeopardy" (Financial Times, 1/26/2014), and “Finance: In search of a better bailout" (Financial Times,
1/26/2014).

in order to …nance an ex-ante pro…table investment opportunity. The project takes time to fully mature:
early payments divert funding from the project (or from complementary infrastructure) and decrease its
associated expected output.

The country is subject to shocks, which a¤ect its productivity and thus its

ability and willingness to repay its debt. In this environment, short-term debt is costly because creditors
may be unwilling to roll it over in the face of bad economic prospects, triggering a debt crisis.

If the

country could commit to a path of future debt issues, these risks could be avoided by issuing long-term debt.
Absent this ability to commit though, long-term debt is also problematic. The reason is that, once issued,
the country will be tempted to dilute it by issuing more debt in the future. In this regard, as in much of
the recent sovereign debt literature that incorporates debt maturity, short-term debt plays a “disciplinary”
role by reducing the incentive to dilute. This gives rise to a set of incentive compatible maturity structures
that keep dilution in check. Key to choosing among these possible maturity structures is how they a¤ect
both the likelihood and the cost of debt crises. In equilibrium, the country’s choice of maturity structure
optimally trades o¤ the costs and bene…ts of short-term debt.
We use the model to analyze the e¤ects of alternative debt restructuring regimes. In particular, we assume
that the country can request help from an international …nancial institution (e.g., the IMF) and that the latter
chooses whether to intervene, i.e., restructuring is an equilibrium outcome. In the event of intervention, the
IFI halts all payments to creditors as well as new borrowing by the country, and restructures outstanding
debt following the guidelines of the regime, e.g. this regime could write down all debt proportionally or only
that of a subset of creditors or it could lengthen the maturity of debt due that period.4
Any restructuring regime has both ex post and ex ante e¤ects.

Restructuring can enhance ex post

e¢ ciency by preventing ine¢ cient payments during times of crises, which decrease the total net present
value of resources to be shared between the country and its creditors. But restructuring regimes also a¤ect
the ex post distribution of resources between creditors and the country and among creditors themselves.
Both ex post redistribution and e¢ ciency enhancement will have ex ante e¤ects on the relative cost of debt,
on the optimal maturity structure, and on welfare.
Our main welfare result is as follows: a su¢ cient condition for a restructuring regime to increase ex ante
welfare is that it not decrease the expected total value of payments to creditors during times of crises. This
result is intuitive yet surprising. It implies that, despite the central role played by short-term debt, the way in
which a regime distributes payments between short-term and long-term creditors during crises is irrelevant.
What matters instead are total payments to creditors as a whole in these critical periods. This suggests that
the debate over the merits of restructuring regimes should not be centered on the distribution of payments
among creditors, but rather on the distribution of surplus between creditors and the debtor country.

In

addition, we show that restructuring regimes may need to o¤er ex post incentives in order for a country to
be willing to restructure, potentially creating tension between ex ante and ex post e¢ ciency.
4 Given

the large literature that already exists on the topic of solvency crises.(e.g., Calvo 1988, Cole and Kehoe 2000, Corsetti

et al. 2006), we ignore self-ful…lling crises and the role for an IFI as a potential lender of last resort.

2

Our paper complements the literature on the optimal maturity structure of debt. Most theories build on
the notion that, in a context of incomplete markets, debts of di¤erent maturities allow for greater hedging
of risk.5

More relevant for our purposes, the maturity structure of debt may also impact the repayment

prospects and incentives faced by a borrower who is unable to commit to a future path of actions.

In a

model of corporate debt with several features in common with ours, Brunnermeier and Ohemke (2013) show
how a debtor’s inability to commit to a debt maturity structure leads to a suboptimally short maturity
structure.

In the banking literature, Diamond and Rajan (2001) have shown how short-term debt may

discipline borrowers and induce them to undertake certain actions that are desirable ex ante but which
would not otherwise be incentive compatible ex post.6
This “disciplinary”view of short-term debt has been recently extended to the context of sovereign debt,
where the critical additional assumption is the inability of a government to commit to repay its debts.7 In
this context, as shown by Jeanne (2009), short-term debt can provide incentives even when the government
can commit to a future path of debt issues and hence is immune to the temptation to dilute. Instead, the
role of short-term debt is to expose the government to costly roll-over crises in the absence of pro-market
reforms, rendering the latter incentive compatible.8

More recently, Aguiar and Amador (2014) show that

short-term debt provides governments with greater incentive to deleverage than the equivalent long-term
debt. This stems from the need to roll over short-term debt every period. The cost of doing so forces the
government to internalize, period by period, the probability of default. In the case of long-term debt, by way
of contrast, the evolving probability of default is a cost borne by the creditors rather than by the government.
Our paper complements this literature by developing a simple model of sovereign debt maturity, in which
short-term debt plays a key role, and by using the model to understand the welfare implications of reforms
to the international …nancial system.
The quantitative literature in this area has also explored the role of dilution in determining the structure
5 In

a closed-economy model with full commitment, for instance, Angeletos (2002) and Buera and Nicolini (2004) have shown

that, even if the government has access only to non-contingent bonds, it can structure an optimal portfolio of maturities to
replicate the hedging properties of contingent bonds.
6 In a related vein, Debortoli et al. (2014) have recently shown that a government’s ability to commit to repayment but not
to a path of debt issuance limits its ability to use the maturity structure for hedging purposes.
7 Of course, there are other motives for why a sovereign may wish to issue short-term debt. Broner, Lorenzoni and Schmukler
(2008), for instance, document that the relative cost of long-term borrowing is high for emerging markets and show that this
is consistent with the existence of risk-averse creditors. The latter favor short-term debt, thereby making it relatively cheaper
and more attractive for governments to borrow in this fashion. See Niepelt (2014) for relevant theoretical results in an in…nite
horizon model with no government commitment.
8 Bolton and Jeanne (2009), on the other hand, assume that the government cannot commit to a future path of debt
issues which leads, as in our model, to the threat of dilution.

Instead of focusing on the maturity structure of government

debt, however, they study the optimal mix of debt that is di¤erentially di¢ cult to renegotiate (either fully renegotiable or
non-renegotiable).

They show that, although the …rst-best would be to issue only fully renegotiable debt and thus obtain

state-contingency, the possibility of dilution forces the government to issue an ine¢ ciently large amount of non-renegotiable
debt.

of debt maturity.9

Hatchondo et al. (2015) …nd that the costs imposed by dilution are quantitatively

important, in the sense that eliminating the government’s ability to dilute existing debt (for instance, though
seniority clauses) has a substantial negative e¤ect both on the frequency of defaults and on average spreads.
In a related vein, Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2012) …nd that – absent the possibility of self-ful…lling crises
– the costs associated to dilution are high enough to discourage the use of long-term debt altogether and
Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012) show that a calibrated model of endogenous debt maturity can account
for the observed relationship between maturity length and the term structure of interest rate spreads in
emerging markets.10
Our paper contributes three important insights to our understanding of the role of short-term debt. First,
it shows that even if short-term debt is issued only for “disciplinary”reasons, countries may …nd it bene…cial
to issue more than what would be strictly required for these purposes as there may be trade-o¤ between the
total incidence and the severity of debt crises. Second, the paper shows that the welfare consequences of
alternative restructuring regimes depend critically on how they a¤ect total expected payments to creditors
in these crises episodes. Although these reforms are likely to have important redistributional e¤ects between
short- and long-term creditors, we show that these e¤ects are irrelevant from an ex ante perspective. Lastly,
the analysis shows that short-term debt may play a novel disciplining role by providing additional incentives
for the country to call the IFI in the event of a crisis. In other words, the country may use short-term debt
not only as a commitment device to prevent full dilution of long-term debt, but also as a commitment to
resort to the IFI when a crisis ensues. This may lead countries to issue more short-term debt in response
to some restructuring regimes, even if the regime makes short-term debt more expensive.
The paper proceeds as follows.

The Model

In this section we present a model of a country’s optimal choice of maturity structure prior to the introduction
of an International Financial Institution (IFI). We make several simplifying assumptions (e.g., a …nite horizon
and two states of nature) that allow us to obtain analytical solutions and to highlight the mechanisms
underlying the main results. They key trade-o¤ between short and long-term debt –the former increasing
the likelihood of costly crises whereas the latter increasing the scope for dilution – and the analysis of the
factors that in‡uence this trade-o¤ should carry through to more complicated environments.
9 To

preserve recursivity in an in…nite horizon environment the quantitative literature has also made simplifying assumptions

(e.g., constant-coupon bonds that mature probabilistically (Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2012), or perpetuities with coupon
payments that decay at a geometric rate (Hatchondo and Martinez (2009)).
1 0 See also Bai et al. (2014), who extend the quantitative framework to include a country’s choice of a growth rate of debt
payments.

Consider therefore a model in which time is discrete and there are three periods: t = 0; 1; 2: There are
two types of agents: a risk-neutral country that is small in world capital markets and perfectly competitive
risk-neutral creditors. The country can consume in periods 1 and 2 and discounts future consumption at
=

where R > 1 is the gross safe rate of return per period in the international capital market.

The

country’s expected welfare in period 0 is given by

where

( ) takes the value ( ) whenever the country defaults and is zero otherwise, as will be discussed

in greater detail below.
In period 0, the country is endowed with an indivisible productive investment opportunity of size 1; which
matures fully only in period 2. We assume, for simplicity, that the country has no other sources of income
and thus the project can only be …nanced by borrowing. We follow the sovereign risk literature and assume
that borrowing is subject to three contracting frictions: it is undertaken through non-contingent bonds; these
bonds cannot be renegotiated ex post, in the sense that any failure to meet stipulated payments triggers a
default; and, the country cannot commit to a path of future borrowing.11
The project requires one unit of investment in period 0 and yields a stochastic return in period 2. In
particular, output in period 2 is given by
y ( ; k) =
where

k, for

denotes the productivity of the project (with

simplicity, we set

and 0

k

1 denotes is …nal size. For

= 0. Note that the …nal size of the project, k, can be di¤erent from one: the reason is

that the project can be interrupted by the country. In particular, as we shall discuss in greater detail below,
the country can disinvest a portion

2 [0; 1] of its project in period 1. Thus, at the beginning of period 2,

the amount of capital remaining in the project is k = 1

.

Information about the productivity of the project is revealed over time. In period 0, before accessing
capital markets, the probability that
of the project is positive, i.e., p0

=

H

is given by p0 . We assume that the net expected present value

2

> R . At the beginning of period 1, a new signal regarding productivity
R1
is received and the updated probability of = H becomes p G(p), where p 2 [0; 1] and p0 = pdG (p).
H

0

At the beginning of period 2,

2f

L; H g

is realized. All signals are publicly observed.

To …nance the initial unit investment in the project, the country issues short-term (ST) and long-term
(LT) bonds in period 0. Each bond promises to pay one unit of the consumption good: ST bonds pay at
t = 1, whereas LT bonds pay at t = 2. We use b01 and b02 to respectively denote the quantity of ST and
LT bonds issued in period 0, with b = (b01 ; b02 ), and let q01 and q02 denote the market price of each type of
bond at the time of issuance, with q = (q01 ; q02 ). Thus, …nancing the project requires satisfying the following
budget constraint:
q01 b01 + q02 b02
1 1 For

1

(3)

a broad discussion of the role of these assumptions in the sovereign debt literature, see Aguiar and Amador (2013).

5

As we will show later on, bond prices are uniquely determined by the debt structure b. This allows us to
write q; (b) = (q01 (b); q02 (b)), so that the budget constraint depends only on b. We henceforth use T (b) to
denote the set of debt structures that satisfy this equation, and T1 (b) to denote the set of debt structures
that do so with equality.
In period 1, after p has been realized, the payment of ST bonds becomes due. At this point, the country
can pay these creditors by issuing new bonds b12 at a unit price of q12 and using the proceeds from this sale.
It can also obtain funds by disinvesting from the project. We assume that disinvestment is costly, though.
Formally, disinvesting

units of capital from the project in period 1, given a signal p, yields F ( ; p) units of

output in period 1 where
F ( ; p) <

p

H

R

for p 2 (0; 1] with F ( ; 0) = 0; F1 > 0; F2

(4)

Equation (4) implies that disinvestment is ine¢ cient in the sense that it reduces the present value of total
output. This assumption is a shorthand for the notion that, in certain times, it may be costly for the country
to generate internal resources to pay ST creditors: it may, for instance, need to engage in austerity measures
that reduce spending in complementary areas (e.g. cuts in social spending and infrastructure projects), or
it may need to engage in excessive taxation that distorts economic activity and reduces potential output.
Thus, the country is only able to repay ST creditors in period 1 if
q12 b12 + F ( ; p)
In period 2, after

b01 , for some

1

(5a)

has been realized, the payment of all outstanding bonds becomes due. At this point,

the country can only pay its creditors by using available output

k. Thus, repayment is feasible only in

period 2 only if
k

b02 + b12

Of course, in order to be able to borrow in equilibrium, the country must not only be able, but also
willing, to repay its debts. There are two forces that sustain repayment in the model. First, we assume
that creditors can seize the country’s output whenever there is a failure to meet stipulated payments. In
period 1, we take this to mean that creditors can e¤ectively force the country to engage in disinvestment.
In period 2, this means that creditors are able to directly seize output y ( ; k).12

Second, we assume that

any failure to meet promised payments subjects the country to a non-pecuniary default penalty in period
2: this penalty can be thought of as encapsulating any future losses that a country faces after a default.13
1 2 The

model is robust to assuming that only a fraction

transferred to creditors. For expositional simplicity we let

2 (0; 1) of output or of the project’s proceeds can be e¤ectively
= 1. It is also robust to allowing the country to save any funds

obtained from disinvesment (net of the amount paid to creditors) at the international interest rate. These funds could be
entirely non-seizable by creditors (see our original nber working paper (2015) for details).
1 3 This is a common assumption in the literature. The costs typically emphasized encompass: loss of reputation that reduces
trade in goods or assets between the defaulting country and the rest of the world, economic sanctions imposed on the defaulting
country by the rest of the world, costs associated to the economic content of defaults, or costs related to domestic holdings of
public debt. For a discussion of the theoretical undeprinnings and the empirical evidence, see Borensztein and Panizza (2009)
and Sandleris (2012).

6

Thus, if the country defaults in period 2 when productivity equals

2f

L ; H g,

it su¤ers a penalty equal

to ( ). If the country instead defaults in period 1, it does not repay anything thereafter and it therefore
su¤ers the default penalty ( ) in period 2, for

2f

L ; H g.

It is important to remember that debt cannot be renegotiated: whenever the country is unable to meet
stipulated payments, there is a default, creditors obtain funds according to whether default is early (period
1) or late (period 2), and the country su¤ers the corresponding default penalty.14 This implies, in particular,
that early default triggers disinvestment even though the latter is ine¢ cient.

Atomistic creditors …nd it

individually rational to insist upon repayment instead of renegotiating their debts in a coordinated fashion
so as to be paid in period 2.
The timeline of decisions and realizations is summarized in Figure 1. In brief, in period 0 the country
decides its optimal mix of short and long-term bonds, b = (b01 ; b02 ) at market prices q = (q01 ; q02 ).

In

period 1, after information about the true state of nature is revealed via p, the country decides how much
short-term debt to repay, how much to disinvest (required if it is in default) and consume, and the quantity
of short-term bonds b12 to issue at a unit price q12 . In period 2, the state of nature

is revealed, payments

are made, output is seized if the country is in default, and consumption and any default penalty takes place.
Before turning to the solution of the model, we specify the rules that govern intra-creditor repayment.
We assume, as is conventional, that in the event of default all creditors are paid pro rata. If the country is
unable to roll-over short term debt in period 1, then it must disinvest. As we will show, this will only occur
in equilibrium when complete disinvestment does not su¢ ce to repay creditors.

Thus, the entire project

15

will be disinvested to yield F (1; p) and creditors will obtain:

R

F (1;p)
b01 +b02 R 1

If instead the country fails to meet its debt obligations in period 2, then default is declared and all creditors

Feasible Strategies

In this section we describe the country’s feasible strategy set; we solve for the equilibrium strategies in the
next section. Periods 0 and 2 are easy to describe. In period 0 the country chooses whether to fund the
project and its debt structure b.

In period 2, if the country has already defaulted in period 1, the only

action available to it is to consume any available income. If the country has not defaulted in period 1, it

particular, creditors are unable to negotiate as a group, forgive debt, or postpone payments, giving rise to a potential

role for outside parties (the IFI).

can choose whether to repay its debt obligation if feasible (i.e., if b02 + b12

k) or to default.

If full

repayment is not feasible, it will necessarily default.
Period 1 has a richer set of feasible strategies, and the rest of this section focuses on it. In this period,
the country can always choose to default.

It may also be able to avoid default by meeting its ST debt

obligations, either by borrowing fresh resources from …nancial markets (i.e., by rolling over ST debt) or by
disinvesting from the investment project. To meet its ST obligations solely through fresh borrowing, the
country must raise q12 b12

b01 from international creditors. When is it feasible for the country to roll-over

its ST debt? We distinguish between two cases: repayment of b12 by diluting LT creditors and repayment
without dilution. Note that if the country does not raise b01 in fresh funds, it is required to disinvest.
Given b = (b01 ; b02 ), we can divide the period-1 feasible-strategy space into three basic categories as
a function of p: repayment of ST creditors without dilution of LT debt; repayment of ST creditors with
dilution of LT debt; and default in period 1.

2.1

Repayment without Dilution (p

Suppose the country rolls-over its ST debt by borrowing exactly the amount required to repay its ST creditors,
i.e., by issuing b12 =

b01
q12

bonds in the credit market at t = 1. This borrowing does not dilute LT debt (i.e.,

given p, it does not a¤ect the expected value of payments to LT creditors) if and only if b02 + b12
this case, both new creditors and the original LT creditors are repaid fully in period 2 if

are paid nothing otherwise. Thus, the return to LT bonds is una¤ected whereas the price of bonds issued
in period 1 must satisfy q12 = p=R.
It follows from this discussion that a necessary and su¢ cient condition for the country to be able to roll
R
over ST debt without diluting LT debt is that b02 + b01
H . This allows us to de…ne p (b) as the lowest
p
realization of p for which, given a debt structure b, it is feasible for the country to roll-over its ST debt and
fully repay all creditors in period 2 when

The other way to roll over ST debt is by diluting the claims of LT creditors. That is, the country may choose
to issue so many bonds in period 1 that it a¤ects the expected value of payments to LT creditors. In this
case, instead of repaying its LT debt in full in period 2 when

=

H,

the country repays b12 with a portion

of the resources that would have been used to repay LT creditors. This happens whenever b02 + b12 >

that the country is certain to default in period 2. Since creditors are paid pro rata in the event of a default,
as stipulated in equation (7), it follows that q12 =

Of course, this strategy is compatible with rolling over ST debt if and only if q12 b12

the country is unable to pay ST creditors and it must default in period 1. Thus, a necessary and su¢ cient

Equation (9) shows that the revenue obtained by issuing bonds in period 1 is decreasing in p and increasing

In this case, the country’s revenue equals
expected value of output.

their claims are fully diluted. Using pb (b) to denote the minimum value of p compatible with roll-over via
dilution, it follows that

pb (b) =

R b01

(10)

H

Note that whenever p > pb (b) the maximum amount that the country can borrow in period 1 exceeds its

outstanding ST debt. In this case, the country can raise enough resources not only to repay ST creditors
but also to increase its period-1 consumption, all at the expense of LT creditors. This, as we will see, creates
incentives for debt dilution in equilibrium.

2.3

Default in period 1 (p

0)

Lastly, the country can always obtain resources by partially or fully disinvesting from the investment project
in period 1 (i.e., by setting

> 0). Furthermore, this is the only feasible strategy if p < pb (b). For such

realizations of p, the discounted expected value of output is not enough to repay even ST bonds: this leads
ST creditors to demand repayment in period 1 thereby forcing an early default. Although it follows from
equation (4) that the output available from divestment, F (1; p), is less than what would be obtained via full
dilution, the atomistic nature of creditors implies that the latter cannot agree to collectively roll-over their
debt. Each owner of ST debt would …nd it a dominant strategy to hold out and insist upon early repayment.
Note that the same conclusion holds for any amount of disinvestment. Hence, whenever p < pb (b), the project
is fully disinvested and the country defaults early.

Figure 2 summarizes the feasible period-1 strategies at each p given b. This concludes our description

of feasible strategies and we next turn to solving for the equilibrium.

Equilibrium Strategies

In this section we describe the equilibrium strategy of the country. We …rst solve for equilibrium strategies
in period 2 and then work our way backwards.

3.1

Final Period (t = 2)

In period 2, given its debt promises b02 + b12 , the country maximizes the di¤erence between consumption
and default costs.

If

=

L,

the only feasible strategy for the country is to default. If instead

=

H,

since creditors can seize the country’s output in the event of default, repayment is optimal for the country
whenever possible, i.e., whenever
the corresponding penalty (

H)

H

k

b02 + b12

0. After all, any attempt to default would only trigger

without increasing its consumption. Thus, the country repays whenever

feasible in period 2.

3.2

Intermediate Period (t = 1)

Suppose …rst that p < pb(b). Then, as explained previously, the only feasible strategy is for the country to
default immediately, obtaining an expected payo¤ of

E ( ( )) < 0
In this case, the project is fully disinvested, all the output is appropriated by creditors, and the country
su¤ers the corresponding expected value of the default penalty.
If instead p 2 [b
p(b); p(b)), the country can choose between defaulting immediately or repaying ST debt
by diluting LT creditors, thereby postponing the default to period 2. If the country chooses to dilute LT
debt, it is clearly optimal to do so fully by setting b12 ! 1.16

This maximizes its consumption without

changing the default penalty. In this case, its expected payo¤ is given by
p

H

R

b01

E ( ( ))

(11)

From the de…nition of pb in equation (10), this payo¤ is clearly strictly greater than what the country would
obtain by defaulting for p 2 (b
p; p)

Lastly, suppose that the country can repay its ST creditors without diluting LT debt, i.e., p

that the country does not necessarily have to default in period 2 when

Does the country prefer this

option to full dilution? If it borrows just enough to repay ST creditors, the country’s payo¤ is given by:

(12)

Comparing the two expressions yields that repayment is preferred to dilution and default if and only if:

1 6 In

(

our setup, once the country knows that it will default when

(13)
=

H

and pay the corresponding default cost, it …nds

it optimal to fully appropriate the resources of LT creditors by completely diluting their debt. Thus, partial dilution is never
optimal because there is at most one state of nature in which the country may be able to repay. In an economy with various
(or a continuum of) possible values of , the country’s choice of b12 would determine both the set of states in which LT debt is
diluted as well as the extent of this dilution.

10

Equation (13), which we henceforth refer to as the incentive-compatibility or IC constraint, is intuitive:
it says that repayment dominates dilution if and only if the punishment from default when

=

H

is greater

than the gain obtained from diluting LT debt. Full dilution in this case allows the country to appropriate
expected payments to LT creditors, p b02 , in exchange for an increase in the expected default penalty of
p

(

H ).

Note that the incentive compatibility constraint is thus independent of p; the realization of p,

however, determines whether the choice between repayment or dilution is feasible.
Finally, let us brie‡y analyze the strategy of disinvesting from the project. We already argued that this
is the only feasible strategy when p < pb(b). For all other realizations of p, disinvestment is clearly suboptimal

because it reduces expected output. Hence, if the country is going to default, it is always better to do so by
fully diluting LT debt –issuing claims against expected output and consuming early –than by disinvesting
from the project.
We can thus summarize the country’s optimal strategy in period 1 as follows: if p < pb (b), the country is

forced to disinvest its project in period 1 and defaults in that period. If p (b) > p
default in period 1 by fully diluting LT claims.

p (b) and the IC constraint in equation (13) is satis…ed, the country borrows

just enough to repay ST creditors in period 1 and it repays its entire outstanding bonds in period 2 when

H.

Finally, if p

p (b) and the IC constraint is not satis…ed, the country follows the same strategy as

pb (b) –full dilution and default in period 2.

Initial Period (t = 0)

We can now determine a country’s optimal choice of debt structure b = (b01 ; b02 ). We begin by characterizing
the price of ST and LT bonds in period 0. Naturally, these prices incorporate the equilibrium strategies of
periods 1 and 2, as characterized in the previous section.
From a creditor’s zero-pro…t condition, we can write q01 (b) as

Given any debt structure b, equations (8) and (10) determine the threshold probabilities pb (b) and p (b),

whereas equations (14) and (15) determine bond prices q = (q01 (b); q02 (b)). We can then use these, along
with the budget constraint of equation (3), to de…ne the set b 2 T1 (b) of debt structures that enable the
country to raise just enough funds to undertake the investment project. The optimal choice of the country
is then to select among such structures. Formally, the country solves:

i.e., pb (b), and of default, i.e. p (b). It is useful to note for future purposes that pb is solely a function of b01 ,
whereas p is a function of the entire maturity structure.

We are now ready to analyze the country’s optimal choice of debt structure. Crucially, the IC constraint

of equation (13) is incorporated into the price of LT bonds through equation (15). This must be kept in
mind because it may limit the country’s use of LT bonds even though these are in principle desirable. To see
this, we …rst analyze the optimal choice of debt structure in the absence of dilution, i.e., when the country
can commit to a particular path of debt and is therefore not subject to the IC constraint. We then return
to the original model.
3.3.1

Optimal choice of debt structure without dilution

Suppose the country could commit to not issuing any bonds in period 1, i.e., to setting b12 = 0 for all
realizations of p. In this case, the country would not be subject to the IC constraint and the price of LT
bonds would be given by

The rest of the optimization problem remains unchanged, and it is easy to see that the optimal debt structure
would entail setting b01 = 0 and funding the project entirely with LT debt. Consequently, p = 0 and the
country repays LT creditors in full whenever

Hence q02 =

and thus b02 =

Equilibrium

anticipated, we are ignoring all equilibria that arise solely as a result of negative self-ful…lling expectations (e.g., all ST

creditors refusing to roll over their debt because they expect other ST creditors to do the same). These are well-understood
and are easy to incorporate in the analysis.

(17)

The interpretation of equation (17) is clear. When the country can commit to not diluting LT bonds,
it does not need to borrow short-term and it therefore eliminates all possibility of default in period 1.
There is no disinvestment in equilibrium and the country’s expected welfare equals the discounted value of
expected output net of the cost of funds and the costs of default when

=

L.

These costs originate in the

non-contingent and non-renegotiable nature of bonds and thus they cannot be avoided.
With this benchmark in mind, we now characterize the optimal debt structure in the original model.
3.3.2

Optimal choice of debt structure

Can the country fund itself entirely with LT debt in the absence of commitment? Only if the IC constraint
is satis…ed, i.e. if and only if

R2
p0

< (

H ).

If not, creditors correctly anticipate that the country will fully

dilute LT bonds in period 1 and q02 = 0. We henceforth focus on this case by assuming
R2 > p0 (

H)

(18)

which guarantees that any equilibrium with positive debt requires some measure of ST bonds.
We can easily characterize several essential properties of the optimal maturity structure of debt, b =
(b01 ; b02 ). First, b must respect the incentive compatibility constraint of equation (13), i.e., b02

(

H ).

To understand why, note that –once the IC constraint is violated –the marginal revenue of LT debt is zero.
In order for its marginal revenue to be positive, LT debt must increase total expected payments to creditors.
But this cannot not happen if the IC constraint is violated: if p

pb, LT debt is fully diluted; if instead

p < pb, there is full disinvestment and total payments to creditors equal F (1; p) regardless of the amount of
debt issued.

Thus, any amount of LT debt above the IC constraint serves only to increase p(b) without

generating any additional revenue, while pb is una¤ected as it is solely a function of b01 . Second, it is possible

that the country is unable to fund the project in period 0, despite its positive net present value, as a result
of the IC constraint. In this case, the set T1 (b) is empty. A su¢ cient condition to rule out this possibility
is that there exists (b01 ; 0) 2 T1 (b) for some b01 , so that the project can be funded solely by issuing ST debt.
Equation (16) also illustrates the trade-o¤s associated with the use of ST and LT debt. Relative to the
model without dilution in which only LT debt is issued in equilibrium, the use of ST leads to costly debt crises.
These crises take place for all p < p (b): when p < pb(b), they are resolved through ine¢ cient disinvestment
and early (period-1) default; when p 2 [b
p(b); p(b)), they are instead resolved through dilution and late
(period-2) default. The country would thus like to choose the debt structure b 2 T1 (b) that minimizes both

thresholds. There is a potential trade-o¤, however, because pb(b) is unambiguously increasing in b01 but the

relationship between p(b) and b01 is ambiguous. The reason for the ambiguity is that q02 <

q01
R

(i.e., LT

creditors are repaid in fewer states than ST creditors), which makes LT debt expensive. This implies that
substituting ST debt for LT debt so as to keep revenue constant may reduce the overall likelihood of a crisis
13

G p(b) , even though it increases the likelihood that a crisis – when it occurs – is more severe (i.e., it will
involve disinvestment) G (b
p(b)). As a result, a country’s optimal debt structure may lie in the interior of
the IC constraint (i.e., b02 < (

H )).

We relegate a formal proof of this statement to the appendix, but we

provide a graphical discussion in what follows.
In Figure 3, the vertical and horizontal axis respectively represent the quantity of ST and LT bonds
issued by the country, b01 and b02 . The T1 (b) locus represents the combinations of ST and LT bonds that
enable the country to borrow one unit in period 0. This locus need not be continuous, but it is depicted as
such for simplicity. The downward-sloping lines represent “iso-p loci,” i.e., combinations of b01 and b02 for
which p (b) is constant. Among these loci, p decreases as the debt structure moves towards the origin.
The country’s optimization problem can be thought of as the choice of a point on the T1 (b) locus that
optimally combines low values of b01 , and thus of pb(b), with low values of p(b). Panels I and II of Figure
4 illustrate the two possibilities that may arise. In panel I, p(b) decreases as the maturity structure is
lengthened along the T1 (b) locus. Thus, the country minimizes both pb(b) and p(b) by choosing a debt

structure like the one depicted by point A, which lies on the IC constraint and thus has b02 = (

H ).

Panel

II illustrates instead a case in which LT debt is relatively expensive and – at least locally – p(b) increases
as the maturity structure is lengthened along the T1 (b) locus.

In this case, the country faces a trade-o¤

between minimizing pb(b), which requires a longer maturity structure, and minimizing p(b), which requires

a shorter maturity structure.
b02 < (

H)

Consequently, a debt structure like the one depicted by point B, in which

and the IC constraint is slack, may be optimal. This example illustrates how, even if the only

role of ST debt is to control dilution, the country may …nd it bene…cial to issue more of it than what would
be strictly necessary for this purpose because there is trade-o¤ between the total incidence and the severity
of debt crises.
This completes the characterization of the equilibrium maturity structure of debt. The general message
is that, when a country is unable to commit to not dilute LT debt, the maturity structure shortens relative
to what it would otherwise be. This is costly because debt contracts are non-contingent and renegotiation
is not possible (or e¢ cient), so that ST debt exposes the country to costly crises and ine¢ cient repayments
whenever the economic outlook is bleak. We next use this model to evaluate the role of an international
…nancial institution such as the IMF and to explore the merits of debt restructuring or repro…ling in the
event of a crisis.

4

A Role for an IFI

The model features two imperfections that potentially can be addressed by an IFI. The …rst, and most
obvious one, is the lack of coordination among ST creditors. This forces the country to engage in ine¢ cient
disinvestment in order to repay its creditors in period 1 when p is below pb. In this situation, it is clear that

halting repayments would be e¢ ciency enhancing ex post. How would such a policy a¤ect ex ante welfare?

14

The second potential problem that an IFI may be able to address concerns the dilution of LT creditors.
Although there are no ex post ine¢ ciencies associated with dilution –it simply redistributes future output
from LT creditors to the country –it is costly, from an ex ante perspective, as it forces the country to issue
more debt to raise a unit of revenue. This increases the instances of default with or without disinvestment.
How would a policy that addressed dilution a¤ect welfare? Would a country ever …nd such a policy desirable?
To answer these questions, we modify the benchmark model to include an IFI as follows. After observing
p in period 1, the country decides whether to approach the IFI for help.

The IFI then decides whether

to intervene, given the set of policy tools at its disposal. We assume that the IFI maximizes the equally
weighted sum of creditor and country welfare. Hence, it is not concerned with redistribution per se, neither
between the country and its creditors nor within the group of creditors.

Because preferences are linear,

this amounts to the IFI having the objective of maximizing expected output net of default costs – a useful
benchmark.18 Furthermore, we model the IFI as having the same commitment technology as the country:
it cannot commit to a policy rule in advance.

4.1

Restructuring

We start by de…ning a restructuring regime.

A restructuring regime is a set of rules that: i. Guides

interventions in period 1 after p is known, but only if country calls in the IFI; ii. Halts all payments to
creditors at t = 1; iii. Postpones all payments to t = 2, and changes the total amounts due to Dr (p)

and its division between ST and LT bond holders to b (p) =

(b001

(p) R; b002

r

(p)) such that D (p) =

b001

H

(p) R +

b002 (p); iv. Prevents the country from taking on additional debt in period 1.
Next we analyze the consequences of alternative restructuring policies. We often refer to a restructuring
as being imposed by the IFI although in reality such an agreement requires complicated negotiations among
creditors, country, and the IFI.19 In this model we abstract from this procedure and instead discuss the
implications of di¤erent restructuring outcomes.

It is important to note, however, that for a given p,

the restructuring outcome requires the willingness both of the country to call in the IFI and of the IFI to
restructure and is thus an equilibrium outcome.

Thus, this limits restructuring outcomes to those that

enhance ex post e¢ ciency and that do not decrease the country’s ex post welfare.
Before analyzing the equilibrium consequences of restructuring regimes, it is instructive to study an
exogenously imposed restructuring regime.

That is, one that is in place and applied independently of

the desires of the country or of the IFI. The next proposition is central to the paper’s welfare results.
Henceforth, all variables with an r superscript refer to those with a known restructuring regime r in place,
whereas variables without a superscript refer to the equilibrium outcomes in the absence of a restructuring
regime.

Section 6, we brie‡y discuss the e¤ects of relaxing this assumption.

Proof. Note that, for each b = (b01 ; b02 ), pbr (b) = pb (b) and pr (b) = p (b). Thus total expected payments

to creditors are unchanged above p (b) and, by assumption, they are no smaller below per (b).

p (b) ; p (b)). If instead

are unchanged in this interval as well. Hence, this exogenously imposed restructuring regime must raise at

The proposition above is very powerful. It shows that how repayments are distributed across creditors
in times of crisis is irrelevant to the feasibility of a particular bond maturity structure, i.e., to whether that
maturity structure is capable of raising at least a unit of revenue. All that matters is the total expected
value of these payments, not their distribution.

A potentially important assumption, however, was the

exogenous nature of the imposition of the restructuring regime.

We next turn to examining whether the

two relevant parties –the county and the IFI –will want to accept a particular restructuring plan.
Consider …rst the IFI’s willingness to restructure debt in period 1. Since the IFI maximizes expected
output net of default costs, it will be willing to restructure whenever p < pb.

By doing so, it prevents

disinvestment and increases the resources available to distribute between the country and its creditors in
period 2.

For p 2 pb; p , on the other hand, debt restructurings redistribute resources without a¤ecting
Thus, in those cases the IFI would choose not to intervene even if the country desired it.20

The country, in turn, is always willing to call the IFI when p < pb, since it can only be made better o¤
2 0 Even

an arbitrarily small cost of intervention would make the IFI strictly prefer not to intervene. Of course, the IFI would

not intervene when there is no crisis either, p

Proof. We have already established that both the country and the IFI will be willing to implement, ex
post, such a regime for any p < pbr (b). Take any b 2 T1 (b). Note that pbr (b) = pb (b) as pb is only a function

of b01 .

Note next that, by Proposition 1, b 2 T r (b).

Thus, for each b 2 T1 (b), if expected payments

under restructuring are strictly greater than before, the country can lower LT bonds to br02 < b02 such that
the revenue raised is once again equal to 1.21

This implies pr (b01 ; br02 ) < p (b01 ; b02 ).

If, instead, total

expected payments to creditors under restructuring are equal to those without restructuring, the country
sets br02 = b02 , and thus pr (b01 ; br02 ) = p (b01 ; b02 ).

In both cases the country’s ex ante welfare strictly

Restructuring strictly increases a country’s ex ante welfare by

halting ine¢ cient disinvestment in the event of a crisis. This is captured by the …rst integral in equation
(20). But it also changes expected payments to creditors by writing down the total debt.

If expected

payments fall as a result of restructuring, bond prices decrease at t = 0 and the country needs to issue more
debt in order to fund the project. This leads to an increase in p and, consequently, in the expected costs
of default, which could overturn the welfare gains of avoiding disinvestment. In terms of equation (20), the
second integral could be negative. A su¢ cient condition for p not to increase, and thus for restructuring to
be Pareto improving, is that expected total payments to creditors over (0; pb) not fall.

and hence whichever maturity structure was optimal without restructuring remains optimal with it.jj
2 1 If,

when br02 is set to zero, revenue still exceeds 1, then the country can decrease b01 as well. This too increases its ex ante

welfare.

17

We can return to Figure 3 to illustrate why the corollary holds.

A policy that doesn’t change total

expected payments when debt is restructured leaves the T1 (b) locus unchanged. Since the iso-p loci are also
una¤ected by restructuring policies, it follows that the country’s optimal debt structure is also unchanged.
Note that the country is still better o¤: it increases its consumption because restructuring eliminates disinvestment, but the incidence of default remains the same.

Proof. Let bv = (bv01 ; bv02 ) be the optimal maturity structure under v. Consider regime x but with maturity
structure b = bv and hence with pbx (b) = pbv (b) = pb (b). Expected payments to creditors will be higher under

x than under v and hence bv yields the country more than one unit of revenue at t = 0. This implies that the
country can decrease b02 to bx02 < bv02 so that (bv01 ; bx02 ) 2 T1x (b). It follows that px (bv01 ; bx02 ) < pv (bv01 ; bv02 ),

strictly increasing ex ante welfare.jj
This completes our discussion of restructuring.

As shown, the way in which restructuring divides

payments across creditors is irrelevant to ex ante welfare.

Although di¤erent divisions of a given total

amount of payments a¤ect ex ante bond prices, they do not a¤ect the capacity of a given bond maturity
structure to fund the project.

Only total expected payments to creditors matter.

The more generous a

restructuring regime is to creditors ex ante, the greater will be the country’s ex ante welfare gain.
Next we analyze a new policy proposed by the IMF: repro…ling. The latter is considered a light type
of restructuring that extends the maturity of any outstanding debt that is due within a speci…c window of
time such that, if the country’s outlook improves in the near future, this debt can be repaid. In our model,
this policy is easily translatable as a restructuring that rolls over ST debt in period 1 at a rate that ensures
that, if

=

H,

the country is able to repay its debts in period 2.

With no further modi…cations, the results of Proposition 2 apply here as well.

Both the IFI and the

country would be willing to repro…le debt whenever p < pb and this regime would be guaranteed to increase

ex ante welfare if expected payments to creditors did not fall. Neither the country nor the IFI would want
to intervene for p

pb. There would be no new bene…t associated with this policy. The IMF has argued,

however, that although repro…ling is a credit event, the associated default cost should be smaller than before
as only some fraction of the debt is being restructured (see IMF (2014b)).22

We now analyze the welfare

consequences given this assumption.

expected payments to creditors. On the other hand, as will be demonstrated in the proposition below, the
su¢ cient condition for repro…ling to raise ex ante welfare is that the expected value of these payments not
fall, creating a tension between ex post and ex ante welfare.
It is clear that repro…ling debt dominates other forms of debt restructuring for any given Df (p) =

Hence, by Proposition

We can then proceed as in the proof of Proposition (2): if the inequality

in equation (22) is strict, then total expected payments to creditors are strictly greater with repro…ling and
the country can choose bf02 < b02 such that b01 ; bf02 2 T1f (b). It follows that pf b01 ; bf02 < p (b01 ; b02 ),
strictly increasing ex ante welfare. If expected total payments are unchanged, then the original b still raises
one unit of revenue. In both cases, the country’s change in expected welfare from repro…ling is given by

Note that the su¢ cient condition for repro…ling to increase ex ante welfare is very similar to the one
provided for restructuring. Both say that ex ante welfare gains are guaranteed if these regimes do not distribute all the gains (payments) to the country. The added twist in the case of repro…ling is the endogeneity
of the states in which the country will be willing to have its debt repro…led. A simple corollary follows.

20

As shown in this section, a repro…ling regime is guaranteed to increase expected welfare if it does not
decrease expected payments to creditors when actually used.

The tension lies in ful…lling this condition

without eliminating the country’s incentive to actually call the IFI. One way in which the country can
decrease this tension is by adopting a shorter debt maturity than would otherwise be optimal.

This is

f

illustrated in equation (21), which shows that – for a given D (p) – increases in ST debt expand the set
p; Df (p) ; b01 because they reduce the country’s gain from dilution (its ability to consume the di¤erence
between p

H

and b01 R). Thus, somewhat paradoxically, although ST bonds may become more expensive

as a result of a policy that places most of the burden of adjustment short-term creditors, the country may
…nd it optimal to increase its reliance on ST debt in order to provide itself with greater incentives to call the
IFI.

Discussion and Concluding Remarks

There has been much discussion recently regarding the resolution of sovereign debt crises. Much of it has
centered on how to restructure debt, either by extending the maturity of some portion of debt (repro…ling) or
via outright haircuts. This paper provides an analytical framework in which to think about the consequences
of di¤erent restructuring regimes and the role of debt maturity.
In our framework short-term debt plays two roles: on the one hand it increases the incidences of debt
crises by making the country more susceptible to roll-over crises when there is bad news about the country’s
future prospects.

On the other hand, as in much of the recent literature on sovereign debt maturity, it

plays a crucial disciplining role. In our model it reduces the incentive to dilute long-term debt. The model
highlights two potential ways in which restructuring regimes can mitigate the negative consequences of debt
crises. They can halt disinvestment, which is driven by a coordination failure among atomistic creditors,
and they can diminish the incentive to dilute long-term debt, which is driven by the country’s inability to
commit to a certain path of debt in advance.
In this paper we ask whether the expected treatment of short- versus long-term debt during a restructuring/repro…ling episode matters. Despite the critical role played by short-term debt, we …nd the redistribution
of payments between short-term and long-term creditors proposed by di¤erent regimes in the event of a crisis
to be immaterial. What matters instead is how they a¤ect total expected payments to creditors in these
events. The higher are these expected payments, the better is the country’s market access ex ante as long
as it is credible that it will “call”the IFI in the …rst place. This is an important restriction on restructured
payments: they should not be so high as to violate the country’s ex post incentive compatibility constraint.
Our framework contains an important assumption that enable restructuring regimes to harness these
welfare gains: it assumes that debt restructurings halt all issues of new bonds. This feature prevents the
country from borrowing excessively in the aftermath of a restructuring and thus diluting the restructured
debt. Without this restriction, it is conceivable that both restructuring and repro…ling could in fact reduce

21

expected payments to creditors in the event of a crisis, even if the actual terms at which debt is restructured
are favorable to creditors.

Thus, our analysis suggests that the ultimate welfare e¤ects of restructuring

regimes may depend on their ability to control the country’s market access for some time after they are
activated.
More generally, it could be argued that restructuring regimes may resolve some ine¢ ciencies at the
expense of aggravating others, by weakening the country’s ex ante and ex post incentives to undertake
certain desirable actions. To illustrate this possibility, consider a slight variation of our model in which
expected payments to creditors depend not just on the structure of debt but also on other actions (e.g.,
structural reforms) taken by the country. For example, suppose that the country could, after borrowing in
period 0, decide the extent to which output is pledgeable to foreign creditors. In such a scenario, which is
similar to Jeanne (2009), short-term debt would have additional value as a disciplining device. In particular,
by holding short-term debt the country would leave itself open to costly roll-over crises in period 1 if the
pledgeability of debt had not be altered satisfactorily. In this context, a restructuring regime that reduces
the ex post cost of crises may raise their likelihood by weakening the country’s incentives to implement
reforms, potentially reducing welfare.25
Finally, di¤erent restructuring regimes also a¤ect the IFI’s incentives to intervene during debt crises. It
is widely perceived, for instance, that an advantage of current debt restructurings relative to the proposed
repro…ling alternative is that the former deals with debt problems “once and for all”, whereas repro…lings
may exacerbate debt overhang by postponing resolution. This possibility could be easily introduced into
our model by assuming that, although repro…ling has a lower cost of default than repro…ling, it entails a
loss of output due to debt overhang.

This should not be a problem if the country and the IFI correctly

internalize these costs since, presumably, the IFI would choose to apply the correct regime.

One might

imagine, however, situations in which the IFI’s preferences are skewed towards creditors so that it minimizes
creditor losses ex post, e.g. repro…ling debt even when a restructuring would be socially optimal. In such
cases, the country might prefer not to approach the IFI altogether and, in this way, the option to repro…le
debt may reduce welfare relative to regime in which an outright restructuring is the only available policy.
At a more general level, the insights o¤ered by this paper should play an important role in the various
debates regarding the reform of the international …nancial architecture.

This paper has focused on the

maturity structure of debt, since the reforms under consideration have di¤erent e¤ects on short- versus
long-term creditors.

To examine the e¤ects of other reforms under discussion, such as the strengthening

of collective action clauses, it would be important to model other dimensions of the debt structure, such as
the type and jurisdiction of instruments being issued.26

This constitutes an important avenue for future

research.
2 5 This

is similar to the result of Hatchondo et al. (2014) who show in a quantitative model that an improvement in the ability

to renegotiate debt may reduce ex ante welfare. The conjecture is that, by reducing the costs of default, such a modi…cation of
the environment aggravates the problem of debt dilution, thereby reducing welfare.

Optimal debt structure

Proposition 1 The optimal debt structure b may entail b02 < (

H ).

Proof. Assume that the country begins at an arbitrary debt structure b. Suppose that it reduces b01 and
This reduces pb (b), which depends only on b01 . Thus, unless

increases b02 so as to keep p (b) constant.

the change in debt structure reduces revenues, the original debt structure could not have been optimal:
otherwise, it would be possible for the country to …nance the project with lower values of both, p (b) and
pb (b). We show, however, that the impact of any such change on revenues is on general ambiguous.

By di¤erentiating the expression for p (b) in equation (8), it follows that the country can substitute ST

and LT bonds at rate

p
,
R

db01
jp =
db02

(23)

and keep p (b) constant.
We can also express the revenues obtained by a particular debt structure that satis…es the IC constraint
as
q01 (b) b01 + q02 (b) b02 =

The …rst term in the expression captures the fall in revenue that results from the increase in pb (b) –and thus
from the greater instances of disinvestment – associated with a rise in b01 .

The term in square brackets

captures instead the change in revenue that results from changing the composition of b so as to keep p
constant, for a given pb. That is, it re‡ects the change in revenue arising, above pb, from greater payments to

ST creditors vs. lower payments to LT creditors above pb.

In general, the sign of the term in square brackets is ambiguous, though it can be signed when there

is only ST debt. In that case, pb = p and thus the term is negative, so that revenue necessarily increases

when b01 falls and b02 increases. This implies that it is never optimal for the country to issue only ST debt,
since it can –by lengthening its maturity structure –increase revenues while reducing pb (b) and keeping p (b)
constant. In all other cases, the term in brackets may be positive or negative depending on pb (b), p (b) and

on the distribution function G( ). This means that, in general, it is impossible to rule out the possibility
that the optimal debt structure b entails b02 < (

H ).
