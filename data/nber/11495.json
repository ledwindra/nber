    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper develops an infinite horizon model of public spending and taxation in which policy\ndecisions are determined by legislative bargaining. The policy space incorporates both productive\nand distributive public spending and distortionary taxation. The productive spending is investing in\na public good that benefits all citizens (e.g., national defense or air quality) and the distributive\nspending is district-specific transfers (e.g., pork barrel spending). Investment in the public good\ncreates a dynamic linkage across policy-making periods. The analysis explores the dynamics of\nlegislative policy choices, focusing on the efficiency of the steady state level of taxation and\nallocation of tax revenues. The model sheds new light on the efficiency of legislative policy-making\nand has a number of novel positive implications.\n\n",
