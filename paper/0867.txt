Comment on T. J. Sargent and N. Wallace:
"Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic"

ABSTRACT

Sargent and Wallace (S—W) show that, even when inflation is prima
fade a strictly monetary phenomenon —— prices are flexible, markets
clear and velocity is constant —— inflation is, in the long run, a
fiscal phenomenon. This follows from the government budget constraint
and the existence of an upper bound on the real per capita stock of
interest bearing public debt held by the private sector. Together
these ensure that in the long run the growth of the money stock is
governed by the fiscal deficit, if we assign to the fiscal authorities
the role of Stackelberg leaders and to the monetary authorities that of
Stackelberg followers.
The discussion of the formal S—W model focuses on the distinct
roles of public spending and explicit taxes in their model and on the
possibility that optimal policy involves public sector surpluses and a
net credit position of the public sector vis—a—vis the private sector.
It is also argued that the specification of the demand for and supply of
money is ad hoc, a weakness shared by most existing macro models.
Finally

it is shown that if we adjust the published government

deficit figures for the effect of inflation on the real value of the stock
of

nominal government debt (as should be done to obtain a deficit measure
appropriate to the S—W model), the inflation—adjusted government deficit
has been in balance or surplus in the U.K. in recent years. If the
deficit is in addition adjusted for the cycle (as it should be to relate
it to the full employment S—W model), the government has been a
sizeable

net lender. If we then also subtract net public sector

capital formation from total public spending (assuming implicitly that
the real rate of return on public sector investment equals the real
rate of return on public sector debt), we get the inflation—corrected,
cyclically adjusted government current account deficit. This is the
deficit measure of the S—W model. This "deficit" has been a sizeable
surplus in recent years and is likely to remain so in the future.
The inflation tax implied by extrapolation of the past and present
stance of fiscal policy is therefore a "deflation subsidy." The
credibility of the Thatcher government's anti—inflationary policy should

Introduction

The paper by Sargent and Wallace [1981], (henceforth S-W),
establishes the proposition that in the long run inflation is always
and everywhere a fiscal phenomenon.

This result is derived by

constructing a model in which inflation is a strictly monetary
phenomenon

and showing, through the government budget constraint

and the existence of an upper bound on the real per capita
interest—bearing

of

stock

public sector debt held by the private sector, that,

in the long run, the rate of growth of the money stock is governed
by the fiscal deficit.

My comments on the paper fall into three

parts.

Section 2 takes as given the formal specification of the

model

and discusses some features of the model and its solution

that were not emphasized by S-w.

This includes the need to emphasize

the distinct roles of public spending and explicit taxes and the
possibility that the government will run surpluses and/or be a net
creditor to the private sector.

Section 3 scrutinizes the specification of the model, which is
argued to be ad hoc in the sense that

it provides no acceptable

microfoundations for the demand for and supply of money and does not
offer a satisfactory account of the role of money in the economy.
While it is no worse on this account than alternative ad hoc models
of money and growth, it is also no better.

Section 4 discusses three adjustments that must be made to the
commonly published public sector deficit figures in order to relate
1/ only the constant velocity version of the model is considered.

them to the deficit in the sense of the S-W model.

First a

correction must be made for the effect of inflation on nominal
interest rates (and hence on the debt service component of the
deficit) and on the real value of outstanding stocks of nominal
public sector interest-bearing debt.

Second, a cyclical correction

is required to eliminate trarsitory increases and decreases in the
deficit that will cancel each other out over a full cycle.

A third

correction is necessary because the S—W deficit is a deficit on the
public sector consumption or current account.

Published deficit data,

such as the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in the U.K.
include borrowing for public sector capital formation.

It is shown that the inflation-adjusted government deficit,
obtained by subtracting from the measured deficit the reduction due to
inflation in the real value of the outstanding stock of nominally
denominated interest—bearing public sector debt, has been in balance
or in surplus in the U.K. during recent years.

If the deficit is in

addition adjusted for the cycle (as it should be to relate it to the
full employment S-W model), the government has been a sizeable net
lender to the private sector (and the rest of the world) in the past
few years.

Data on net public sector capital formation are hard to

come by and estimates of the real rate of return on public sector
investment are highly speculative.

required

The sign of the adjustment

to get from the PSBR to the government current ac.ount deficit

—2—
is hardly in doubt, however.

On the assumption that net public

sector capital formation has been positive and that the real rate
of return on such investment has also been positive, the public
sector current account surplus (deficit) will have been larger
(smaller) than the PSBR.

Given the favourable prospects for

North Sea oil tax revenues (and barring massive changes in the
stance of fiscal policy), the long-run prospect for the inflationcorrected, cyclically adjusted public sector deficit suggests large
and continuing surpluses.

The past, present and prospective

future stance of fiscal policy is therefore conducive, in the S—W
framework, to a sizea.ble and sustainable reduction in the rate of
inflation.

The problems of the Thatcher government in achieving

a rapid and significant deceleration of inflation can therefore
not, following the logic of the S-W approach, be attributed to a
failure to support monetary stringency with an appropriate fiscal
policy and the "credibility" of the Medium Term Financial Strategy

(MTFS) cannot have been undermined by large inflation-adjusted
cyclically corrected public sector current account surpluses.

schedules, a cyclical departure of output below its full

employment or normal capacity utilization level will be associated
with an increase in the PSBR above its average value over the cycle.
Provided policy remains unchanged and upswings and downswings alternate
in cycles of roughly equal length and emplitude, a cyclical increase in
the PSBR relative to trend during the downswing will be matched, as
regards its effect on the outstanding stock of public sector debt, by
a cyclical decrease relative to trend during the upswing.

If we take

the financial years 1978/79 and 1979/80 as representing periods of
normal capacity utilization, the deep slump during financial year
1980-81 may well have been associated with a £7 billion cyclical
increase in the PSBR.

Again, while one may quibble with the exact

magnitudes, there can be no reasonable doubt that the inflation-

corrected, cyclically adjusted PSBR has been in quite substantial
surplus during the first two years of the Thatcher experiment.

Government borrowing in the S-W model all consists of public "consumption
loans".

There is no public sector capital formation.

If instead

part of G consistituted public sector investment and if public sector
capital formation yielded the same rate of return R as private
investment and government debt, then borrowing to finance such
investment would not increase the deficit.

The debt incurred to finance

the investment can be serviced exactly from the returns generated by the
public sector investment.

year 1980/81 the corresponding figure is 32%.

To get some

idea cf plausible magnitudes I arbitrarily assume that net investment
is two-thirds of gross investment.

This is probably rather conservative.

The resulting guestimates for net public sector capital formation are in
Table 4, column 4.

Net public sector capital formation even in 1979

accounted for 56% of the PSBR.

In 1977 there even was a small current

account surplus. If we simply subtract the figure for net public
sector capital formation from the inflation corrected, cyclically
adjusted deficit we get very sizeable "real", full-employment current

account surpluses for all recent years; the "true" surplus for 1979 is
of the order of £8 billion, and for 1980 amounts to well over £10 billion.

Clearly governienth can borrow to finance public sector

capital formation without the resulting deficit holding any long-run
inflationary threat, as long as the rate of return on the public sector
investment (net of the proportional rate of depreciation) is no less than
the rate of return on the debt issued to finance the investment.
argue

out

To

against netting the full amount of public sector capital formation

of the PSBR is to argue that the net rate of return on public sector

investment is less than the marginal cost of borrowing.

Indeed, if the

net marginal product of public sector capital is zero, public sector
investment is exactly the kind of wasteful expenditure represented by

G in the S-W model.

While the calculation of the net social rate of

return

on public sector investment is a very important issue, it is

clearly beyond the scope of this paper.

Note that it doesn't matter whether the government directly
appropriates the returns on its investment through charges etc.

If

the returns to the public sector investment accrue to the private
sector (as is the case with much social overhead capital) the goverment
could simply levy taxes (in the least distortionary manner) to service
the debt that financed the investment.

Provided the net social yield

on the public investment equals the marginal cost of public sector
borrowing, there will be no monetary and inflationary consequences of
such bond—financed public sector investment.

Even if the past behaviour of the "real", full employment government
current account deficit (or "true" deficit) was consistent with a policy
of achieving a substantial and sustainable reduction in the rate of inflation,

anticipations concerning the future "true" deficit might still have
prevented such a policy from being successful.

It is clearly very hard

to make reasonable conjectures concerning the course of the future "true"
deficit.

If after the next election, the incoming government were to

implement a dramatic fiscal reflation there could be a five year period
of substantial "true" deficits.

In the absence of such a major policy

Given the past record of inflation-corrected, full employment
government current account surpluses and with reasonable prospects
for continuing future surpluses the logic of the S-W approach suggests that the
credibility of the MTFS could not have been undermined by a budgetary stance
that is inconsistent with a sustainable reduction in the rate of inflation
as has been argued e.g. in Sargent [1981].

Implied in the current plans

for spending and taxation is a large future deflation subsidy, not an
inflation tax.

To draw practical implications from the insights

provided by the S-W model we must consider both sides of the public sector

balance sheet: its assets as well as its liabilities.

These assets

include the stock of physical public capital and the government's share
of North Sea oil wealth.

Conclusion
The S-W paper is a useful reminder of the interdependence of
fiscal and monetary policy through the government budget constraint.
Especially transparent is their modelling of the long-run
implications of the government budget constraint once it is

recognized that there is an upper bound on the real pr capita
stock of interest-bearing public sector debt that the private sector

is willing and able to hold: the "permanent" or long—run real
government current account deficit must be financed by the inflation
tax.

The point is of analytical interest even if it is of no

relevance for explaining the persistence of inflation in spite of
restrictive monetary policies in the U.K. (and the U.S.) where recent
and anticipated future inflation—corrected, cyclically government
current account deficits have been negative.

A potential danger of the del is that by

raised. This further worsens the slump. This scenario may well
be helpful in understanding the U.K. experience since mid—1979.
