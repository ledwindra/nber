ABSTRACT
A growing body of literature examines the cross price elasticities between different health care services.
For example, increasing the patient out of pocket price for some health care services increases the
utilization of other health care services. Yet, the literature has generally ignored the connection between
cost sharing for health care services and labor market outcomes. This paper examines the direction
and magnitude of the reduced form relationship between patient cost-sharing and work loss following
methods used to study the impact of cost-sharing and medical spending, finding a positive, quantitatively
meaningful association between cost-sharing and hours absent. We find no such association between
cost-sharing and the probability of incurring short-term disability days. This suggests that the cross-market
ramifications of higher patient cost sharing extend beyond other health care services to include broad
labor market outcomes.

Introduction
In 2010, almost 100 million individuals received insurance coverage through employersponsored health plans offered by large and medium sized firms in the United States (Garrett and
Buettgens 2011). Employers therefore exercise considerable control over the features of
insurance plans. For example, there can be significant variation across employers in the structure
and amount of out-of-pocket cost sharing requirements that the employees face when they use
care. For example, because of variation in the number of tiers in a formulary, and placement of
drugs on those tiers, the copayment charged to employees for any given prescription could range
across employers from $0 to over $90 (Kaiser Family Foundation/HRET 2011). Moreover, over
the past several years, employers have been increasing cost sharing requirements including
copayments for medications in an effort to control spending. For covered workers with three or
four-tier prescription drug cost sharing, average copayments for generics rose from $8 in 2007 to
$11 in 2011, and preferred brand name medications rose from $15 to $25 (Kaiser Family
Foundation/HRET 2011).
Extensive literature examines the ramifications of these employer decisions, focusing largely on
the effects of patient cost-sharing (i.e., copayments, coinsurance) for prescription medications on
health care utilization of health care services. The literature is dominated by studies of the direct
effects of variation in cost sharing (e.g., the impact of higher prescription drug copays on use of
prescription drugs) (Goldman, Joyce et al. 2004; Gibson, Ozminkowski and Goetzel 2005).
While the effects vary across medication classes and patient groups, for the most part, higher
levels of prescription drug cost-sharing have been associated with lower levels of medication
utilization and adherence. A growing body of literature examines the cross price elasticities
3

between cost sharing for some services and the utilization of others (e.g., the impact of cost
sharing for prescription drugs on hospitalizations, complications, emergency department visits,
and medical spending) (Chandra, Gruber and McKnight 2010; Goldman, et al. 2004; Gibson,
Ozminkowski and Goetzel 2005; Afendulis et al., 2011). Generally, the evidence supports the
connections between markets, which is interpreted largely as a health effect: adhering to
medications that treat chronic disease prevents adverse events that lead to use of more expensive
services.
Yet, because health care data is generally segregated from other types of employer data, the
literature has generally ignored the connection between use of health care services and labor
market outcomes. In general, adverse events and poor health status can lead to higher spending
on expensive healthcare services, as well as missed time at work and reduced productivity (Carls
et al. 2012; Loeppke et al. 2011; Gibson, et al. 2010).
Our aim is to examine the direction and magnitude of the reduced form relationship between
cost-sharing and work loss following methods used to study the impact of cost-sharing and
medical spending. To do so, we analyze a unique database containing quarterly employee-level
data reports of lost work time (absence hours and short term disability days) and cost-sharing
amounts. One underlying concern is that, at a point in time, prescription drug benefit generosity
may be positively correlated with generosity of absence and short-term disability benefits.
Employees in plans with lower prescription drug cost-sharing (more generous) may also receive
larger (more generous) allocations of absence and disability benefits, which will create an
omitted variable bias suggesting lower prescription drug cost sharing is related to more absence
and disability days. Because absence and disability benefits are very stable over time we address
4

this concern by estimating fixed effects models, focusing on the longitudinal relationship
between changes in cost-sharing and lost work time. We estimate these models on two cohorts of
employees undergoing treatment for pain, where changes in cost-sharing, health, and healthcare
utilization are likely to be quickly realized in terms of lost work time.
We report two main findings. First, we find a positive association between cost-sharing and
hours absent, which, though the effect is small in percentage terms, has large fiscal implications.
Second, we find no such association between cost-sharing and the probability of incurring shortterm disability days.
The paper proceeds as follows. We describe our approach and then describe the characteristics
of the medication class and its relationship to work loss. Next, we describe our methods and
provide a detailed overview of our estimation strategy. Following are results, and in the final
section we offer some conclusions.
Framework
Employers offering health benefits to their employees usually proffer a limited number of health
plans to employees residing in a geographic area. Each health plan available to the employees
within an employer (which we refer to as an employer-health plan or plan) provides a set of
covered benefits at a level of cost-sharing to plan enrollees. Our aim is to analyze the
relationship between prescription drug cost-sharing and work loss in the reduced form. We do
not identify a mechanism connecting cost-sharing and work loss, but are estimating the
magnitude and statistical significance of the relationship between plan generosity (an important
benefit management tool for employers) and time lost from work that may stem from differences
5

in adherence to medication or changes in care-seeking behavior. We focus on the marginal costs
of services to the employee (e.g., copayments or coinsurance) because deductibles for
prescription drugs are somewhat uncommon in general and are quite rare in our data set.
We construct a panel data set with employees as the cross sectional unit and calendar quarters as
the unit of time. In each quarter, an employee is also mapped into an employer-health plan, and
cost-sharing amounts for the employer-health plan are recorded on each observation in the data
set. Employees can change plans over time (though this is rare) so they do not fully nest within
employer-health plans. This creates a three-level, multilevel model (quarter, employee,
employer-health plan) and we address this directly in our estimation approach.
In cross-sections, employers offering more generous medical benefits may also offer more
generous absence or short-term disability benefits (or may differ in other ways), which may
explain why the cross-sectional relationship observed between cost-sharing and time lost from
work is negative (i.e., employees with lower levels of cost-sharing report a greater number of
absences and/or disability days). We focus on the effects of changes in cost-sharing on changes
in absence and disability using a fixed effect model. If the resulting association between an
increase in cost-sharing and work loss is positive, then plans reducing the generosity of
prescription drug benefits experience increases in absence and/or work loss.
Pain Management
Pain medications (analgesics) are some of the most commonly prescribed medications in the
United States. From 2005-2008 when ranked in terms of the percentage of adults using a
prescription drug in the medication class, pain medications ranked second after antidepressants
6

for adults 18-44 (5.1% of adults) (National Center for Health Statistics 2011). Similarly, for
adults 45-64 years pain medications ranked third after antihyperlipidemic agents and
antidepressants with 14.0% filling a prescription for a pain medication.
Pain and painful conditions are associated with high rates of absence and work days lost. In a
random sample of 28,902 workers in the United States in 2001-2002, 57.2% reported a common
painful condition in the previous two weeks (e.g., headache, arthritis, back pain, other) and 7.2%
reported two or more hours of time lost from work due to a painful condition (Stewart et al.
2001). Disease exacerbations and pain control are also related to work loss. Almost one fourth
of workers with arthritis currently experiencing a pain exacerbation reported lost productive time
from work, compared to 13.1% with arthritis who were not experiencing a pain exacerbation
(Ricci et al. 2005).
While many pain medications are over the counter or available in generic form, many others are
brand name and are often indicated when pain management and control is an issue. We focus on
two cohorts of patients prescribed brand name non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)
and opiod pain medications. The first is employees with a diagnosis of a chronic medical
condition that is marked by significant pain (the chronic pain cohort). Chronic pain diagnoses
include osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis and neuropathic pain. Second, as a
sensitivity analysis we include all employees meeting the selection criteria, regardless of
diagnosis (All diagnosis cohort).
We selected pain management as our condition of interest as it is an immediate phenomenon –
these medications work in hours or days and have a short half-life. Also, pain and work
7

productivity have strong ties; therefore, within the two cohorts changes in medication utilization
or care-seeking would be likely to manifest in the short-term in changes in hours lost from work.
Methods
Data Source
Information from the Truven Health MarketScan Health and Productivity Management Database
was used for this study. The database contains health insurance claims for inpatient, outpatient,
and pharmaceutical services for enrollees from employer-sponsored health plans offered by
approximately 150 medium and large-sized firms in the United States. For a subset of these
firms, medical claims data are supplemented with productivity management information for two
types of lost work time: absence hours and short term disability days. The absence and short
term disability data sets are, for the most part, mutually exclusive.
Study Population
Employees were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were between the ages of 18 and 64,
were continuously enrolled for at least 7 quarters between January 1, 2006 and December 31,
2008, filled a prescription for pain medication, and had no indication of pregnancy throughout
the study time frame. Employees enrolled in high-deductible plans, or comprehensive pain
management programs were excluded because of broader effects of those programs that could
not be measured.
Within the study time frame, the date of first fill in the medication class was assigned as the
index date for each employee. Employees were followed until December 31, 2008 or through
8

the last complete calendar quarter prior to disenrollment, must have been active employees on
the index date, and must have been continuously enrolled for at least 1 year prior to the index
date to measure preindex health status and at least 3 calendar quarters after. To exclude patients
with a single episode of pain, employees also had to have a second pharmacy claim in the
medication class during the 2 months following the index fill date. We excluded the first (index)
quarter observed for each employee, as the first quarter is most likely to be endogenous with
worker absence or disability.
Measures of Lost Work Time
Two types of lost work time were calculated per quarter throughout the study time frame, hours
absent and days of short term disability for each employee. The information is recorded in the
personnel time management systems of the employers. Hours of absence represented the sum of
hours recorded for all short-term absence types (e.g., vacation, personal and sick time) since
employees may trade off hours recorded for each type of absence (e.g., using vacation time for
sick leave). In addition, some of the employers grant employees a bank of hours of leave from
work that does not distinguish between types of absence. Our approach allows pooling of
absence information across employers.
Short-term disability days represent the number of days in each calendar quarter that the
employee received short-term disability benefits while they were unable to work. Very few
employees utilize this benefit (5-10% of the employees in our sample in a quarter), therefore, we
estimated receipt of short term disability benefits as a dichotomous outcome.
Estimation
9

Our data set contains three dimensions of variation: time (calendar quarters), employees, and
employer-health plans. Because the error components may be correlated with the observed
explanatory variables, we estimate the parameters using a fixed effects three-way error
components model (Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis, 1999; Andrews, Schank and Upward, 2006).
In the linear form we consider the following model:
Yit = xit + wP(i,t)t + uiη + qP(i,t)ρ + i + p + t + it

(1)

Where i indexes employees, t indexes time in calendar quarters, and p indexes employer-health
plans. Yit is the dependent variable. Both employees and plans are assumed to enter and exit the
panel resulting in an unbalanced panel with Ti observations per employee and N* = Ti
employee-quarters in total. The fixed effects are i for the employee, p for the plan and t for
time. We assume it is strictly exogenous. Terms xit and ui are vectors of observable employee
covariates. wP(i,t)t and qP(i,t) are vectors of observable plan covariates and are indexed with P(i,t)
as employees can change plans over time (employees do not fully nest within plans). P(i,t) maps
employee i to plan P at time t. Each unique employee*employer-health plan combination in the
data set denotes a ‘spell’ of plan enrollment, which is indexed with s.
Both i and ui are time invariant for employees and p and qP(i,t) are fixed over time for plans. xit
varies over i and t and wP(i,t)t varies across p and t, although the data are collected at the i,t level,
therefore plan covariates also vary at the i,t level.

10

The explanatory variable of interest, the prescription drug cost sharing amount, is in . We can
obtain consistent estimates of  and  by time demeaning within each employee-plan spell. We
define the spell-level heterogeneity as:

s  i + uiη + p + qP(i,t)ρ

(2)

Substituting (2) into (1)
Yit = xit + wP(i,t)t + qP(i,t)ρ + s + t + it

(3)

Within each employee-plan spell, the spell level heterogeneity, s, does not vary and can be
removed by subtracting averages at the spell level. We assume that ut are fixed and are
estimated directly using time dummies (hence, not reflected in the next equation).
(Yit – Ybars) = (xit - xbars) + (wP(i,t)t - wbars) + (it - bars)

(4)

To examine the relationship between cost-sharing and absence hours we first estimate an OLS
model with time fixed effects and standard errors corrected for possible correlation within
employee over time (Model I-OLS). Because we do not include spell fixed effects, this model is
identified, in part, by differences across employers and will suffer from bias associated with
unobserved generosity of absence and disability benefits, but it serves as a useful benchmark.
We then estimate Equation (4) fitting a three-way fixed effect model with spell-level fixed
effects, time fixed effects, and standard errors corrected for possible correlation within employee
over time (Model II-OLS Spell Fixed Effects).

11

Since absence hours are recorded as counts, as a comparison we also estimate the three-way
fixed effects model in Equation (4) with a conditional ML Poisson regression (with a log link
and robust standard errors) using the same covariates (Model III – Poisson Spell Fixed Effects).
We estimate two linear probability models for use of short term disability: OLS (analogous to
Model I) and OLS Spell Effects (analogous to Model II).
We estimate each of these models for two cohorts of employees: those with chronic pain
diagnoses and the larger cohort of employees including all patients treated for pain, regardless of
diagnosis of chronic pain.
Explanatory Variables
The key explanatory variable is the patient cost-sharing amount imposed by the employer-plan
for the medication class of interest. This is based on the average cost-sharing amount in dollars
(i.e., copayment, coinsurance) per prescription (standardized to a 30-day supply) for medications
in the medication classes (ie, brand name NSAIDs and opiods). Employer-plan cost-sharing is
represented in each calendar quarter as patients are likely to respond to the prices they face, even
if they do not fill a prescription within that class.
Sociodemographic variables included age in years, gender, urban (versus rural) area of residence,
median household income (from the Census Bureau based on ZIP code of residence), percent
college graduates (based on ZIP codes), US census region (Northeast, North Central, West, and
South), and the hourly/salaried status of the employee.

12

Two health-status measures were also included and were calculated in the 12 months of
continuous enrollment prior to the index date. The Deyo Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)
accounts for the effects of comorbid conditions based on the presence of ICD-9-CM codes in the
health care claims (D’Hoore et al. 1996). Psychiatric Diagnostic Groupings (PDG) were also
accounted for in this study during the pre-index period. The PDGs measure the presence of
psychiatric or substance dependent conditions. There are 12 possible PDGs, which are
aggregated from ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes (Ashcraft et al. 1989). Examples include alcohol
use disorders and other substance use disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic
stress disorders, and schizophrenia.
All models include an array of time fixed effects representing each calendar quarter (with
2Q2006 as the reference quarter).
Results
We found 4,763 employees filling prescriptions for pain medication meeting the selection
criteria who also had absence information and 20,273 employees meeting the selection criteria
who had short-term disability data (Table 1). About one quarter of these employees (1,495 with
absence information and 6,144 with short term disability information) had a diagnosis of chronic
pain (osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis or neuropathic pain). Within these four
groups, patients had relatively similar characteristics. Approximately two thirds were age 45 and
older and about 60% were male. Reflecting the composition of the data contributors, the South
region was most prevalent, representing 40-46% of the employees, and the vast majority lived in
an urban residence (over 88%). The mean CCI score was less than 0.5, indicating that the
average comorbidity burden was less than 1 condition per employee. The average PDG score
13

was below 0.25, indicating that the number of psychiatric comorbidities was less than 1 per
employee.
Table 2 contains additional descriptive statistics about the employee cohorts, including the two
main measures of interest: absence hours and the percent of employees using short-term
disability benefits in a quarter. On average, employees with chronic pain recorded 76.7 hours of
absence, and employees with all diagnoses had five fewer hours of absence on average. Shortterm disability use rates were 10.25% for employees with chronic pain and were 4 percentage
points lower for employees with all diagnoses.
Results from the absence hours models for the chronic pain cohort (those with a diagnosis of a
condition associated with chronic pain) with largely cross-sectional identification (OLS estimates
I) revealed that the coefficient of cost-sharing is negative (p<0.01) (Table 3a), reinforcing our
concern that employers with less generous cost-sharing policies (higher cost sharing) may also
have less generous absence benefits (and thus fewer absences).
However, when focusing on the longitudinal variation in prescription drug generosity, we find a
positive association: rising cost-sharing amounts were associated with increases in absence
hours. In the linear, three-way, spell-level fixed effect model (II) a $1 increase in copayments
was associated with 0.470 (p=0.004) additional hours of absence, and the magnitude of the effect
was similar in the Poisson model (III). This suggests a price elasticity of absence of about 0.16.
Results from the absence hours models for the all diagnosis cohort (those treated for pain,
regardless of diagnosis) were similar to those of the chronic pain cohort. The cross-sectional
model revealed an inverse relationship between cost sharing and absence (p<0.05). In the linear
14

spell-level fixed effects model the estimated effect size was smaller than the estimates in the
narrower chronic pain cohort, but retained statistical significance (0.342 additional hours of
absence, p<0.01). Finally, the Poisson spell-level fixed effects model yielded a positive,
statistically significant coefficient (p<0.01) with a similar effect size in this cohort. This
suggests a price elasticity of absence of about 0.12.
Unlike the absence hour models, in the cross-sectional short term disability models the
coefficient on cost-sharing was positive and not statistically significant (Table 4). When adding
spell-level fixed effects to the model, the results were less pronounced than the absence models
and none reached statistical significance.
Effect Size
While we do not attempt to estimate the structural relationships, we are able to estimate the
financial impact of foregone medication use on productivity based on estimates of adherence and
days supply per prescription. In Table 5 we display predicted values associated with a $5
increase in cost sharing per prescription (about 20%). In our fixed effects models, the number of
absence hours per calendar quarter also rises by approximately 1 hour (in the OLS model,
chronic pain cohort) to 2.4 hours (Poisson model, chronic pain cohort). This corresponds to
approximately 1.3% - 3.1% change in absence hours.

Using methods analogous to our analysis

of absences, we estimate a demand elasticity for utilization of pain medications within each
cohort (not shown) of about -0.35 (within the range reported in the literature) (Goldman et al.
2004; Gibson et al. 2005). Accordingly, with a 20% increase in copayment of $5, we expect a
7% drop in prescriptions. Therefore, because the average number of brand name pain
15

prescriptions per person per quarter was 0.5, we estimate about 0.035 foregone prescriptions/
person/ quarter (0.5 prescriptions * -7%). Combining our estimates of foregone prescriptions
(converted to days supply lost based on a 30 day prescription) and our estimates of increased
absences, we estimate that 1 hour lost of absence (1/8 of a day, or 12%) is associated with 1.05
days supply lost (0.035 foregone prescriptions * 30 days supplied per prescription). Thus, our
estimates imply that if an employee in chronic pain does not take these medications for one day,
the employee has a 1/8 chance (12% chance) of missing a day’s work (8 hrs).
Though the effect size in hours is modest, the fiscal consequences may be large. If we assume
that a $5 increase in cost-sharing (20%) is associated with a 1 hour increase in absence (~1.3%)
this would be valued at $42/hour fully loaded with fringe benefits (workers in private industry,
large establishments) (BLS 2012). Alternatively, the average hourly earnings for Americans
overall is about $31 loaded. The $31-$42/hr in absence-related costs would offset any employer
savings associated with raising copayments.
Those savings, from the perspective of the employer and assuming no wage offset, would consist
of $5 per prescription filled (now paid by the worker not the firm) and the employer costs
associated with foregone prescriptions. In our sample, employees average about 0.5 brand name
pain medication prescriptions/ person/ quarter (so the employer saves $2.50).
Given our estimate of .035 foregone prescriptions/ person if we estimate the employer cost of
prescriptions at $100 per prescription (the high end of the range in our data, we estimate a
savings of $3.50). Combining this with $2.50 associated with the cost shift on inframarginal
prescriptions, yields a savings of $6.00/ person per quarter, which is small relative to the
16

productivity costs. If we assume full wage offset, the societal cost would be only the cost of the
foregone prescription (employer and employee share) which would be even smaller than $6.00.
However, the calculation of savings is imprecise for several reasons. It likely overstates the
effects as productivity losses are unlikely to amount to 1-2 full hours as an employee may work
from home when sick, or other employees may perform additional work duties for the absent
employee. Yet even if the effective hours of work lost is only 20 minutes (a third of an hour),
the productivity loss is still large relative to the savings.
More importantly, this calculation focuses on a single medication class, and the patient is
typically on multiple classes of medication. On average these patients fill a total of 5.6
prescriptions per quarter in addition to brand name pain medications. This would increase the
savings from $6 to $60 (if overall elasticity is -.35). This exceeds the productivity costs, but the
productivity costs still offset about half of these savings. Moreover, the total savings associated
with higher copayments are lower than estimated above because we omit any increased medical
spending due to less use of medications, which in other cases have been estimated to be nontrivial (Roebuck et al. 2011; Sokol 2005, Chandra, Gruber, McKnight 2010). Thus while there
is a lot of uncertainty associated with the full financial effects of copayment increases, which is
not our focus, the magnitude of the productivity costs seems meaningful in comparison to the
medical costs.

Diagnostic checks

17

Fixed effect models remove the cross-sectional variation and the effects of time invariant
observables, identifying effects based on variation in cost-sharing changes over time. The strong
assumption inherent in our identification strategy is that trends in outcomes are similar in plans
that changed cost-sharing (prior to the cost sharing change) and plans that did not change costsharing. We compared trends in outcomes (absence and short term disability) in the quarters
prior to the cost-sharing change for the two thirds of plans that eventually changed their costsharing to trends in outcomes for plans that did not change cost-sharing. This comparison was
made by regressing outcomes on an indicator for plans that changed their cost-sharing, a time
trend and the interaction of the two, controlling for clustering over time by plan. We found that
there were no significant differences in the absence or disability time trends for plans that
eventually increased copayments (prior to the copayment change) and those that did not (for
absence hours, coefficient= -0.85 p = 0.561 and for any short-term disability days, coefficient =
-0.002 p = 0.194.
To address concerns of omitted time varying variables--where cost sharing may be changing at
the same time as other aspects of compensation or sick days, or where cost sharing may be
changing at the same time as other employee characteristics are changing--we first correlated
changes in prescription drug copayments and changes in medical office visit copayments to
determine if prescription drug and medical benefits moved in concert. The correlation between
changes in medical copayments and prescription drug copayments was near zero (-0.02 for
employees with absence data and 0.03 for employees with short term disability data), reflecting
that the structure of prescription drug benefits was often carved out from other health benefits.
We also analyzed two measures of health status, the Charlson Comorbidity Index and Psychiatric
18

Diagnostic Groupings, each measured in each quarter of the data. We then regressed changes in
copay on changes in each of these health status measures in separate regressions and found no
significant relationship between changes in health status and changes in cost-sharing.

In addition, if employees with lower health status that have a choice choose lower copayments,
these employees may also be more likely to be absent. However, there was little choice of
prescription drug plan benefits in these firms, most prescription drug benefits were similar across
medical plans for a given employee, and our results sign in the opposite direction. If selection on
health status is occurring our results are most likely biased downward.

We performed two additional sets of sensitivity analysis. First, we included a measure of benefit
generosity in the non-drug medical benefit (the plan-level percentage of total payments borne by
employees) and the results were similar. Second, we removed the two health status measures
(CCI and PDG) from the covariates and the coefficients of the models were almost identical to
those presented here.

Discussion
Previous research on the effects of prescription drug copayments has focused on the impact of
higher copayments on the utilization of prescription drugs and other medical services. Yet,
because prescription drugs are an important part of chronic disease management, their effects
may impact broader aspects of patients’ lives. One area of particular importance is worker
productivity. Our analysis, focused on workers with chronic pain, confirms that higher
copayments are associated with more absences from work, but effects on short-term disability
are not statistically significant. Often lost in the discussion about medical pain management is
19

attainment of appropriate levels of use of pain medications through sufficient limits and supports
to maintain productivity (US FDA 2012). Medications should be taken according to the
physician’s instructions, and not exceeding the prescribed dosage or frequency.
The intent of our study was not to conduct a full cost accounting associated with raising
copayments or to make policy recommendations. Instead we addressed the more focused
question about whether changes in medication use might affect productivity, focusing on a
patient group where effects are likely to be manifest quickly. The effects and effect sizes may not
be similar to other condition cohorts. We focused on active workers with chronic pain, who may
differ substantially from other patients with chronic pain as they continued to participate in the
workforce. Now that we have found a modest, though fiscally meaningful, effect within this
patient cohort, future research focusing on other conditions and exploring structural relationships
should be considered and evaluations of health policy changes should strive to integrate
productivity effects when possible.
