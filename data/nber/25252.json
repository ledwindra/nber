    "abstract": "\n\nCyclical patterns in earnings can arise when contracts between firms and their workers are incomplete, and when workers cannot borrow or lend so as to smooth their consumption. Earnings cycles generate occasional large changes in earnings, consistent with some recent empirical findings. At the calibrated parameter values, financial constraints promote investment in reputation \u2013 an intangible capital form \u2013 in contrast to their documented inhibiting effect on investment in tangible capital.\n\n",
