Data are generated from a dynamic deterministic solution of a structural model; a VAR model is estimated using a subset of these data; and the properties of the VAR model are compared to the properties of the structural model. This procedure has the advantage of eliminating the effects of error terms, since the data are generated from a deterministic simulation. The results show that the VAR models do not seem to be good structural approximations.\n\n",
