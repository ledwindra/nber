    "abstract": "\n\nWe face a variety of potential catastrophes; nuclear or bioterrorism, a climate catastrophe, and a  \"mega-virus\" are examples.  Martin and Pindyck (AER 2015) showed that decisions to avert such catastrophes are interdependent, so that simple cost-benefit analysis breaks down.  They assumed that catastrophic events cause \"destruction,\" i.e., a reduction in the stream of consumption.  But some catastrophes cause death instead of, or in addition to, destruction.  Here we incorporate death in a model of catastrophe avoidance, and show how it affects the interdependence of catastrophic events and the \"willingness to pay\" to avoid those events.\n\n",
