1. Introduction
A large number of studies have shown that wage and earnings inequality increased
sharply in the United Kingdom since the late 1970s.1 With perhaps the exception of the
United States, the magnitude of the increase in wage inequality was unmatched in any
other industrialised countries.2

For example, wage inequality remained relatively stable

during the same period in the major continental European countries (Germany, France
and Italy) while it increased at a more moderate pace in Canada and in Japan. This
increase in earnings inequality was accompanied by a decrease in the earnings gap
between men and women. Again the changes in the gender wage gap experienced by the
United Kingdom and United States appear to be more dramatic than those found in other
countries.
The divergent experiences of different countries in terms of wage inequality is a
major challenge for explanations that focus on changes in the relative demand for labour
across different skill classes. The most popular demand side explanation for rising wage
inequality is that over the last couple of decades, technological change has been biased in
favour of skilled workers.

It is difficult to see, however, why this type of technical

change should have been more pronounced in the United Kingdom than in countries like
France and Germany.
Another possible explanation for the unique wage inequality experience of the
United Kingdom is that since 1979 the institutional structures of the U.K. labour market
changed dramatically.

Union decline, falls in public sector employment, contracting out

and competitive tendering of some public sector services resulted in changes in the way
pay was formally set.

Wages councils (who set minimum rates of pay in some low

paying and female dominated industries) were weakened and finally abolished in 1993.
Some women would have benefited from the increase in scope of sex discrimination and
equal pay legislation, however. The depth and coverage of employment protection
legislation was reduced, basically making it easier for firms to sack their workers.
Changes to the social security and welfare system may have affected work incentives,

possibly increasing competitive pressure on wages at the bottom part of the distribution
and changing the composition of the workforce.
The main question we ask in the paper is whether these reforms in the institutional
structure of the labour market contributed to the increase in inequality in the United
Kingdom?

On the one hand, a quick comparison of the experiences of different

European countries suggests that the answer to this question is “yes”. Countries like
France and Germany neither experienced the dramatic labour market reforms nor the
sharp increase in wage inequality that the United Kingdom experienced over the last two
decades.3 On the other hand, it is possible that the United Kingdom would have diverged
from the experience of the rest of Europe without any policy changes given the existing
differences in the structure of collective bargaining and the educational and training
systems. It is therefore difficult to identify the precise effect of these policy reforms
through a broad comparison of the leading European economies.
Comparisons between the United Kingdom and the United States may be more
fruitful, however, for at least three reasons. First, the U.S. and U.K. labour markets of the
late 1990s are very similar. Wage setting where unions are present is decentralised and
unions have little influence over pay in the private sector. In neither country is there a
wide-ranging system of vocational education and training.

Formal skill acquisition

occurs at school or at university rather than on the job.4 Second, given that it is possible
to think of the institutional changes in the United Kingdom as transforming its labour
market in a more “U.S.-style”, the United States is a natural benchmark for assessing the
impact of these reforms. Third, changes in the United Kingdom (as discussed in section
2 below) were more likely to affect men, while changes in the United States (basically the
decline in the real value of the U.S. minimum wage between 1979 and 1990) were more
likely to affect women.

A comparison of the difference in the difference in trends

between men and women across the two countries may help to disentangle the effect of
these institutional changes from other country-specific trends as well as trends that are

West Germany over the 1980s
4
This is not to say there is no on the job training in the United Kingdom and the United States but merely
that training schemes which give works accredited transferable skills are rare

2

common to both countries. The primary goal of this paper is to examine this in more
detail.
The plan of the paper is the following. In Section 2, we describe the data and
present descriptive statistics on the evolution of the distribution of wages in the United
Kingdom and the United States during the 1980s and 1990s.

In Section 3 we look

directly at the role of unionisation, privatisation and the minimum wage in explaining the
key differences between the evolution of wage inequality in the two countries. In Section
4, we present some qualifications and extensions to the main results of Section 3. We
conclude in Section 5.

2. Data and Descriptive Statistics
2.1 Data Sources
For the United Kingdom we use a multiple dataset approach as there is no one
dataset which is ideal for our purpose. More precisely, we compute the basic trends in
wage inequality using the family expenditure survey (FES) for 1978 to 1996
supplemented with the autumnal labour force survey (LFS) for 1997-99 and, in few
cases, by the General Household Survey (GHS). We analyse the effect of unionisation
and public sector affiliation on wage inequality by comparing the 1983 GHS and the
1998 LFS. For the United States we use data from the outgoing rotation sample of the
Current Population Survey (CPS). A more detailed discussion of all the datasets we use is
given in the data appendix.

2.2. Descriptive Statistics.
Throughout this paper, we focus on the evolution of overall measures of (hourly)
wage inequality such as the standard deviation, inter-percentiles range such as the 90-10
wage ratio, and the whole density of wages. This focus is deliberate given our interest for
the role of economic reforms and labour market institutions on the wage distribution. A
large number of studies have stressed the importance of supply, demand, and skilled

3

biased technical change in the evolution of wage differentials across education groups.5
These wage differentials only represent, however, a small fraction of total wage
variability across individuals.

More importantly, previous research has shown that the

effect of factors such as unions and the minimum wage are best captured by modelling
the whole distribution of wages rather than just focussing on the more standard wage
differentials by age or education.6

For the sake of completeness, however, we also

present below few education- and age-related wage differentials and a standard betweenvs. within-group variance decomposition.
Figure 1 plots the evolution of the median and the 10th and 90th percentile of male
and female wages in the United Kingdom and the United States between 1978 and 1999
(1978 to 1998 in the United Kingdom, 1979 to 1999 in the United States), normalized to
100 in 1979.7 The path of the medians indicates very different patterns of wage growth
for different groups. In both the United Kingdom and the United States, median wages of
women increase substantially relative to men. This translates into a substantial decline in
the gender wage gap (at the median) as reported in Figure 3. This finding is consistent
with other U.S. and U.K. studies such as Harkness (1996) and Blau (1998). Interestingly,
the change in the wage gap is very similar in the two countries. Median female wages
have increased from about 64% to 73% of the male median in the United Kingdom and
from 64% to 75% in the United States. A second important difference is that real wages
grew much faster in the United Kingdom than in the United States during this period.
For instance, the median of U.S. male real wage declined between 1979 and 1998
compared to a 25 percent growth in the United Kingdom. 8
Figure 1 also indicates that wage inequality increased for all four groups during
this period. In all four cases, the 90th percentile grows relative to the median. A closer

5

See, for example, Katz and Murphy (1992) for the United States, Schmitt (1996) for Britain, and Freeman
and Needels (1993) and Card and Lemieux (2001) for international comparisons between the United States,
the United Kingdom, and Canada.
6
See DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996).
7
In Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1, we have adjusted the 1997 and 1998 data to ensure there is no
discontinuity between the 1996 FES and the 1997 LFS due to differences in the survey instruments. See
the data appendix for more details.
8
A similar difference has been noticed in other comparisons between the United States and France (Card,
Kramarz and Lemieux, 1999) or Germany (Beaudry and Green, 2000). Beaudry and Green suggest that
differences in the accumulation of physical capital per capita, which grew much faster in Germany than in
the United States during this period, may help explain this important gap.

4

examination of the figure indicates, however, that most of the growth in inequality
actually occurred during 1980s, while inequality remained more stable in the 1990s.
Figure 1 also shows that inequality increased more for some groups than some others.
For example, the increase in wage inequality over the whole sample period is much less
pronounced for men in the United States than in the United Kingdom. These trends in
wage inequality are more readily seen in Figure 2 that reports the evolution of both the
90-10 differential and the standard deviation of log wages. Both the standard deviation
and the 90-10 differential show the same steep increase in wage inequality in the 1980s,
followed by more modest growth in the 1990s.
Beyond these broad similarities in the pattern and growth of wage inequality in
the United Kingdom and the United States, Figures 1 and 2 also illustrate some important
differences between the two countries. The slowdown of inequality growth in the 1990s
is much more marked in the United States, and in particular for women. Over the 1980s
the increase in the both the 90-10 differential and the standard deviation of female wage
is larger in the United States than in the United Kingdom. In the 1990s the opposite is
true. In addition, the level of wage inequality, as measured by the standard deviation and
the 90-10 differential, is systematically lower for men than women in the United
Kingdom, while the opposite is true in the United States. Furthermore, the figure shows
that while wage inequality grows faster for men than for women in the United Kingdom,
the opposite is true in the United States.
One way of summarising the data is to say that the extent of wage inequality has
converged in the two countries over the last 20 years.

While there were important

differences in the level and pattern of wage inequality across gender and countries in the
late 1970s, much of these differences have vanished by the late 1990s.

Male wage

inequality in the United Kingdom has caught up to the level of female wage inequality
and is moving closer to the level of male inequality in the United States.
The convergence in wage inequality in the two countries is shown more explicitly
in Table 1 which reports several measures of inequality for men and women in 1979,
1989, and 1998.9 For example, the 0.084 U.S.-U.K. difference in the male standard

9

The statistics reported for 1979 and 1989 in the United Kingdom are averages for 1978 to 1980, and 1988
to 1990, respectively.

5

deviation in 1979 (0.460 in the United States vs. 0.376 in the United Kingdom) declines
to 0.063 in 1989 and 0.028 in 1998, which is only a third of the original difference. By
contrast, the U.S.-U.K. difference in the female standard deviation is relatively modest
throughout the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the standard deviation and the 90-10 wage differential are two
standard measures of wage inequality that capture different features of the wage
distribution.

For example, changes in the wage distribution above the 90th percentile

affect the standard deviation but not the 90-10 differential.

A more general way of

looking at what happens where in the distribution of wages is to plot the whole
distribution of wages. In this light Figure 4 shows kernel density estimates of the
distribution of (log) wages for men and women in the United Kingdom in 1979, 1989,
and 1998.

For both men and women, there is clear visual evidence that the wage

distribution becomes increasingly unequal over time.

In both cases, the density in the

middle of the distribution declines while it increases in the tails.
Figure 4 also shows that the female wage distribution is positively skewed in all
years.

The distribution of male wages is also skewed, but to a much smaller extent. This

skewness in the U.K wage distribution is also illustrated in Table 1 which shows that the
90-50 wage differential is systematically larger than the 50-10 differential. The situation
is quite different in the United States. Figure 5a shows that the male wage distribution in
1979 was in fact negatively skewed, though it becomes much more symmetric over time.
As in the case in the United Kingdom, there is clear evidence of an overall increase in
wage inequality.

The density of wages declines in the middle of the distribution and

increases in the tails.
These qualitative changes in the shape of the U.S. male distribution are confirmed
in Table 1 which shows that the 50-10 wage differential is substantially larger than the
90-50 differential in 1979. By 1998, however, the distribution is more or less symmetric
since the 90-50 and 50-10 differentials are comparable. By contrast, the U.S. female
wage distribution, shown in Figure 5b, is positively skewed, and the 90-50 wage
differential is systematically larger than the 50-10 differential.

The increase in overall

inequality is perhaps clearer for U.S. women than for other groups because average
wages are relatively stable over time.

As a result, Figure 5b clearly shows that the

6

density declines in the middle of the distribution but increases in the tails.

The same

pattern is not as clearly seen for other groups because average wages shift substantially
over time.
In summary, the different pieces of evidence all suggest that the U.K. wage
distribution is becoming increasingly similar to the U.S. wage distribution.

This is

particularly clear in the case of men for which the shape of the wage distribution
(skewness) and the extent of inequality (standard deviation and 90-10 differential) were
quite different in 1979. Most of these differences had vanished by 1998. There is also a
convergence between the U.K. and U.S. female wage distributions, though differences
were perhaps more subtle in 1979 than in the case of men.

The 1979 density in the

United Kingdom has a well-defined single peak while there is a relatively flat section in
the middle of the U.S. distribution.

By contrast, the shapes of the U.K. and U.S.

distribution look much more similar in 1998.
Since real wages were initially lower but grew faster in the United Kingdom than
in the United States, both the level and the distribution of wages have converged. One
simple way of representing this overall wage convergence between the two countries is to
show to which percentile of the U.K. real wage distribution corresponds a given
percentile of the U.S. real wage distribution.10 Figure 6a illustrates these “Q-Q” plots for
men in 1979, 1989, and 1998.11

The figure shows, for example, that the median wage

for U.S. men is equivalent to the 90th percentile of the U.K wage distribution in 1979.
The percentile of the U.K. wage distribution corresponding to the U.S. median drops to
the 70th in 1989 and to the 60th in 1998 as U.K. real wages keep catching up to U.S.
levels.

Overall, the relationship between U.K. and U.S. wage percentiles gets

increasingly close to a 45 degrees line, which illustrates dramatically the convergence

10

We use the OECD purchasing power parity exchange rates for 1996 (0.65 pounds per dollar) to convert
the U.K. real wages (in 1996 pounds) into 1996 U.S. dollars.
11
To make the figure more informative, we have normalized the scales using the inverse of the cumulative
normal distribution. The reason for doing so is that if the distribution of (log) wages is approximately
normal in both countries, U.K. percentiles (in the normalized scale) are a linear function of U.S. percentiles
and the variance of U.K. wages is lower if this slope is smaller than one. The same interpretation of the
“un-normalized” Q-Q plots only applies if the (log) wage distributions are approximately uniform. It is
clear from Figures 4 and 5, however, that the empirical wage distributions are much closer to a normal than
to a uniform distribution.

between the distribution of real wages in the two countries. The same basic pattern of
wage convergence is also observed for women in Figure 6b.

2.2. Wage Dispersion Between and Within Groups of Workers
Our focus on overall wage inequality is different from the bulk of the literature that has
mostly focused on the evolution of wage differential between different “skill groups”
such as college and high school workers.

For the sake of comparability with this

literature, we present a set of standard age and education wage differentials for the United
Kingdom and the United States in Table 2. These differentials are computed by running
regression of log wages on a set of age and education dummies. We use the same set of
age dummies for the age groups 23-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-59 in both countries. For
the United States, we use a set of five education categories: high school dropouts, high
school graduates, some college, college graduates and college post-graduates.
Unfortunately, the information on educational achievement is quite limited in the
FES samples.

The wage differential reported in Table 2 for 1979 and 1989 are thus

computed using the General Household Survey (GHS) while the LFS is used for 1998.12
To get large enough samples, we pool the 1978, 1979 and 1980 GHS to compute wage
differentials for 1979, and the 1988, 1989 and 1990 GHS for 1989. We construct six
education categories for the GHS and the LFS: no qualification, some vocational
qualifications (low, middle and high), A-O level qualifications and university graduates.
We also decompose the variance of wages into a between- and within-group component
by running wage regressions on a rich set of individual characteristics.13
With few exceptions, the different measures of wage dispersion reported in Table
2 show trends similar to those reported earlier for overall wage inequality. For instance,

12

As discussed in the Data Appendix, the GHS is not an ideal data sources because weekly hours of work
are not measured consistently over time. Despite this shortcoming, however, the FES and the GHS show
quite similar increases in the standard deviation of log hourly wages during the 1980s. Table 1 indicates
that between 1979 and 1989, the standard deviation computed using the FES increased by 0.088 and 0.077
for men and women, respectively. Comparable numbers from the GHS are 0.081 and 0.083, respectively.
13
The variables used in log wage regression are a set of regional dummies (ten regions and London in the
United Kingdom, nine regions and SMSA status in the United States), a dummy variable for marital status,
and a set of education dummies (seven in the United Kingdom, five in the United States) fully interacted
with a fourth degree polynomial in age. The U.S. models also include dummy variables for race and
veteran status.

8

there is generally a more marked slowdown in inequality growth in the United States than
in the United Kingdom during the 1990s. Another difference between the two countries
is that the wage gap between college (university) and high school (A-O level) educated
workers has expanded faster in the United States than in the United Kingdom. 14

This

explains why a larger fraction of the growth in inequality comes from the between-group
component in the United States.
A related point is that, in absolute terms, the growth in between-group inequality
is more or less similar for men and women in the two countries.

The differential

evolution in inequality for men and women highlighted previously is almost entirely
driven by changes in within-group inequality which increases more for men than women
in the United Kingdom, while the opposite is true in the United States.

While

explanations for changes in the structure of wages based on the supply and demand for
different skill groups have natural implications for between-group inequality, they have
little testable implications for within-group inequality.

Therefore, it is unlikely that these

explanations could account for the differential evolution of inequality among men and
women in the two countries. This provides an additional motivation for focusing on the
role of labour market reforms and institutional changes in the remainder of this paper.

3. Effect of Reforms and Institutions on the Distribution of Wages
We have just shown that the structure of wages appears to have converged for the two
countries.

In the introduction we highlighted the fact that institutional structures have

also converged. On the one hand, U.K. men were relatively better “protected from
inequality” than their U.S. counterparts in the late 1970s because of the strength of U.K.
trade unions. On the other hand, U.K. women were not as well protected from inequality
because of the lack of a comprehensive national minimum wage policy. These two
observations may potentially explain the difference in the evolution of male and female
wage inequality in the two countries between 1979 and 1998. We now examine this view
in more detail.

3.1. Minimum Wages
14

Card and Lemieux (2001) report a similar finding.

9

The minimum wage has been closely linked to the expansion in wage inequality in the
United States during the 1980s. As shown in Figure 7, the real value of the minimum
wage fell sharply between 1979 and 1989 before recovering somewhat in the 1990s.15
DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996) and Lee (1999) argue that the decline in real value
of the U.S. minimum wage accounts for most of the increase in wage inequality in the
lower end of the distribution during the 1980s. This is especially the case for women who
are more likely than men to earn wages at or close to the minimum wage.
The United Kingdom, on the other hand, had no national minimum wage until
1999. Instead workers in some low-paying industries (for example clothing, retail and
catering) were covered by institutions called wage councils which set industry level
minima. These were reformed in 1986 and abolished in 1993 (in Great Britain). In 1993
some 2.5 million workers were covered. The key distinction between the United States
and the United Kingdom in 1979 was in the heterogeneity of coverage. In the United
Kingdom, some low-paid workers had no protection at all, and the levels of protection
varied not only across industries but also (until 1986) within industries. In terms of
changes over time, the United States experienced a steady fall in the minimum wage over
the 1980s affecting all workers in the same way unlike the United Kingdom where there
was no such change. In the 1990s the U.S. minimum rose in real and nominal terms and
we should expect this to halt the growth in wage inequality. We should also expect to see
a small increase in wage inequality for U.K. women after 1993.
The trends, reported in Figure 1 and Table 1, are broadly consistent with the
findings of the previous literature.

During the 1980s, the 50-10 wage differential

expanded faster for U.S. women than for any other groups.

The visual effect of the

minimum wage can also be seen in Figure 5b where the lower end of the female wage
distribution is distorted by the (relatively) high value of the minimum wage. The shape
of the wage distribution evolves towards a more regular bell-shaped distribution in 1989
as the minimum wage becomes increasingly less binding.

The lower end of the

distribution becomes slightly more compressed in the 1990s as the minimum wage starts
15

Between 1979 and 1981, the nominal minimum wage increased from $2.9 to $3.35 but the CPI increased
even faster. The real value of the minimum wage fell sharply as the nominal value of the minimum wage
remained at $3.35 until April 1990 when it was raised to $3.80, and to $4.25 in April 1991. Inflation

increasing again.

By contrast, there is much less evidence of a visual effect of the

minimum wage for men.16
Both Figure 1 and Table 1 also show that the 50-10 wage differential started
narrowing in the United States during the 1990s as the real value of the minimum wage
started increasing again. The fact that the 50-10 wage differential expands in 1980s but
narrows again in the 1990s in the United States, while it keeps expanding in the United
Kingdom, illustrates the important role of the minimum wage for wage inequality.
Figures 1 and 2 also show a small acceleration of the increase in female wage inequality
in the United Kingdom in the mid 1990s.
Broader measures of wage inequality such as the standard deviation and the 90-10
differential illustrate the same qualitative story for women.

Both of these measures

expand faster in the United States than in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, while
the opposite happens in the 1990s (Table 1). The decline and subsequent recovery of the
real value of the minimum wage in the United States is a natural explanation for this set
of facts.
We explore this explanation in more detail in Figure 8 which shows the evolution
of the U.K.-U.S. difference in the variance of female wages along with a measure of the
“pressure” that the U.S. minimum wage exerts on the U.S. variance of wages.17 This
measure of minimum wage pressure is computed using a “tail pasting” procedure
suggested by DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996).

The procedure relies on the

assumption that if the real minimum wage had remained at its highest (1979) value
throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the distribution of wages at or below the 1979 minimum
wage would have remained the same as in 1979. Under this assumption, a counterfactual
distribution can be computed in year t by replacing the part of the year t wage distribution
at our below the 1979 minimum wage by the corresponding section of the 1979 wage
distribution.

Our measure of minimum wage pressure is the difference between this

eroded once again the value of the real minimum wage until October 1996 and September 1997 when the
minimum wage was increased successively to $4.75 and $5.15, respectively.
16
DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) find a clearer impact of the minimum wage for all men age 16 to
64. We miss a substantial fraction of minimum wage workers in this paper by focusing only on workers
above the age of 22.
17
Because of smaller sample sizes, we smooth the U.K. variance of wages using a three-year moving
average before computing the U.K.-U.S. difference in the variance of wages.

11

counterfactual and the actual variance of wages in each year, normalized to zero in
1979.18
Figure 8 shows that our measure of minimum wage pressure more or less follows
the U-shaped pattern of the real minimum wage illustrated in Figure 7.

While the

difference between the U.K. and the U.S. variances follows a more irregular pattern, the
series is also U-shaped as inequality grows slower in the United Kingdom than in the
United States in the 1980s, while the opposite happens in the 1990s.
Interestingly, a simple OLS regression indicates that the minimum wage pressure
variable has a positive and significant effect on the U.K.-U.S. gap in the variance of
female wages.

The estimated coefficient is 0.78 with a standard error of 0.20, which

means we cannot reject the null hypothesis that a given change in the variance of U.S.
wages induced by a change in the minimum wage has a one-to-one impact on the U.KU.S. gap in the variance of wages. This finding is robust to the inclusion of a linear time
trend which is not statistically significant.

However, only about half of the variation in

the variance gap can be explained by the minimum wage pressure variable (the R-squared
of the regression is 0.46). The results nevertheless confirm that the U.S. minimum wage
goes a long way towards explaining the relative evolution of female wage inequality in
the two countries.
One interesting conjecture is that the introduction of the U.K. minimum wage in
1999 may have contributed to the U.K.-U.S. convergence in wage inequality and labour
market regulations for women in the same way U.K. de-unionisation potentially did for
men. Figure 2 shows that, though the gap has declined over time, wage inequality was
still larger for U.K. women than U.K. men in 1998. This raises the obvious question of
whether the introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1999 was enough to “tilt the
balance” in the U.S. direction by pushing U.K. female wage inequality below U.K. male
wage inequality.

18

We compute the counterfactual distribution by replacing all year t observations at or below the 1979
minimum wage by corresponding 1979 observations, and re-weight observations so that the total number of
(weighted) observations remains unchanged. For the procedure to be valid, we need to assume that there
are no employment or spillover effects due to the minimum wage. DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996)
and Lee (1999) argue that, if anything, these assumptions tend to understate the true impact of the
minimum wage on the distribution of wages.

12

In Table 3, we perform some simple simulations using the 1998 LFS to gauge the
potential effect of the minimum wage on male and female inequality in the United
Kingdom. In these simulations, we assume that only a fraction of workers earnings less
than the 1999 minimum wage of 3.6 pounds would have earned at least 3.6 pounds if this
minimum wage had prevailed in 1998. As is well known, because of imperfect coverage,
lack of compliance, or measurement error in self-reported wages, a substantial fraction of
workers report wages that are below the minimum wage.

On the basis of recent

estimates provided by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), we assume that two thirds
of workers who report wages below 3.6 pounds in 1998 would have earned at least 3.6
pounds if the minimum wage had prevailed in that year.19 We carry the simulations by
randomly picking two thirds of workers earning less than 3.6 pounds and increasing their
wages to 3.6, while leaving wages of other sub-minimum wage workers unchanged.20
The results of these simulations are reported in column 2 of Table 3. The table
shows the 5th and 10th percentiles of the wage distribution, as well as the 90-10
differential and the standard deviation of log wages.

The simulated impact of the

minimum wage is the difference between the simulated value of these wage statistics in
column 2 and their actual value for 1998 in column 1. The results for men in Panel A
indicate that the minimum wage has no effect on either the 5th or the 10th percentile of the
wage distribution. This simply reflects the fact that less than five percent of men earned
less than 3.6 pounds in 1998 (the 5th percentile is 3.84). Nevertheless, we estimate that
introducing a 3.6 pounds minimum wage would have decreased the standard deviation of
log wages by 0.014.
As expected, the minimum wage has a much larger effect for women. Panel B of
Table 2 shows that introducing a 3.6 pounds minimum wage would have raised both the
5th and the 10th percentile to 3.6.

This effect is strong enough to lower the 90-10

differential by 0.054 and the standard deviation by 0.030. As a result, both the 90-10
differential and the standard deviation become lower for women than for men.
19

Using data from the New Earnings Survey (NES) and improved wage data from the LFS, the ONS
estimates that, relative to 1998, the fraction of workers age 22 and more earning less than 3.6 pounds
declined by 4.6 percentage points in 1999 and 5.7 percentage points in early 2000. The latter figure
represents about two thirds of the fraction of workers we observed below 3.6 pounds in 1998.

13

With the recent release of the 1999 LFS data, it is also possible to see how the
actual distribution of wages has evolved with the introduction of the minimum wage.
Column 3 shows the various wage statistics for 1999 using the same average hourly
earnings measure as in 1998.21 Since March 1999, however, the LFS has started asking
directly the hourly rate of pay of hourly rated workers, just like in the U.S. CPS. In
column 4, the direct information on hourly wages is used for all workers who answer this
question. In both the United Kingdom and the United States, the effect of the minimum
wage on direct measures of hourly wage rates is much clearer because of the
measurement error in average hourly earnings measures.22
One difficulty with a straight comparison of the wage distribution between 1999
and 1998 is that factors other than the minimum wage may have also changed the wage
distribution during this period. For instance, male wage inequality remains more or less
constant during this period, suggesting that other sources of increasing wage inequality
may be offsetting the impact of the new minimum wage. If these other factors have the
same impact for men and women, however, a more accurate measure of minimum wage
impacts is obtained by contrasting the evolution of wage inequality for men relative to
women.
The male-female difference in wage inequality are shown in Panel C. In 1998,
there was little difference in wage inequality between men and women (column 1).
According to the simulation reported in column 2, wage inequality should now be larger
for men than women with the introduction of the national minimum wage. Depending on
which wage measure is used for 1999, the male-female difference in inequality is either
slightly smaller (column 3) of larger (column 4) than predicted by the simulation.
Overall, these results confirm our conjecture that the introduction of the national
minimum wage in 1999 was enough to pull U.K. female wage inequality below U.K.

20

As discussed by DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996), we probably understate the impact of the
minimum wage in these simulations by ignoring possible spillover or disemployment effects. Lee (1999)
confirms that minimum wage impacts become indeed larger when these factors are taken into account.
21
Workers are asked to report earnings for their usual pay period (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.) in the
LFS. Wage rates are then computed by dividing earnings by hours over the relevant period.
22
In the 1999 LFS, only 0.4 % of workers earn exactly 3.6 pounds per hour when average hourly earnings
are used. This proportion jumps to 2.5 % when direct measures of the hourly wage rate are used whenever
available.

male wage inequality. The new minimum wage has, therefore, contributed to the
convergence in wage distribution between the United Kingdom and the United States

3.2 Unionisation
The weakening of the power of U.K. unions throughout the 1980s and 1990s can be
illustrated by the strong decline in the rate of union membership. Figure 9 shows that the
rate of union membership declined by more than 20 percentage points between 1979 and
1998. Though the decline is slightly more pronounced between 1979 and 1989, the rate
of union membership keeps declining up to the late 1990s. By contrast, the decline in the
U.S. rate of union membership is more modest and concentrated in the 1979 to 1984
period.

As a result, the difference in the rate of union membership between the two

countries shrinks from about 28 percentage points in 1979 to about 16 percentage points
in 1998.

This change has affected men more than women. Over the 1990s, for example,

male union density fell from 44% in 1989 to 31% in 1999, while female union density
fell from 33% to 29% over the same period.23
Starting with Freeman (1980, 1982) and Metcalf (1977, 1982), several studies
have clearly established that unions tend to reduce wage inequality among US and UK
males. Studies have also established that de-unionisation has contributed to the increase
in wage inequality in both the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1980s.24
By contrast, the existing evidence suggests that union have relatively little effect on wage
inequality among women (Lemieux, 1993), and that de-unionisation did not play a
significant role in the increase in female wage inequality in the United States (DiNardo,
Fortin, and Lemieux, 1996).
What explains this difference in the impact of unions for men and women? As is
well known, unions have typically two offsetting effects on wage inequality. On the one
hand, wage compression policies of unions result in lower inequality within the union
than non-union sector.

On the other hand, since unions raise the average wage in the

union relative to the non-union sector, they may well increase the inequality between

Gosling and Machin (1995) for the United Kingdom. Because of difference in estimation methods and

union and non-union workers. Lemieux (1993) argues that this latter effect is particularly
important for women for which unionisation is concentrated in highly skilled public
sector jobs such as teachers, nurses, etc. In other words, unions tend to increase wages
for women who would have earned relatively high wages even in the absence of unions,
thereby worsening this source of wage inequality.

This between-group effect is not as

important for union men who are not particularly skilled relative to non-union men.
We first illustrate the effect of unions on wage inequality by performing simple
variance decompositions.

At this stage, we ignore altogether differences in the skill

composition of the union and non-union workforces and basically attribute to union wage
policies the differences in the mean and variance of wages between the union and nonunion sector.
We focus on the effect of union on the wages of union members relative to nonunion members. Ideally, we would divide workers on the basis of whether their wages
and working conditions are covered by a union contact. The U.K. data, however, are not
available for this analysis. Though the distinction between coverage and membership is
relatively minor in the United States where a very large fraction of covered workers are
union members, the distinction is more problematic in the United Kingdom. As a result,
we may well understate the effect of unions on wage inequality by focusing on union
members since a substantial fraction of non members are covered by union agreements.
As explained in the data appendix, we only have data to compute the effect of deunionisation on wage inequality for the two countries for the period starting in 1983.
Given our main goal of explaining the relative evolution of U.K. and U.S. wage
inequality, we do not miss any important developments by focusing on the 1983-98
period as it is then where the time path of union membership diverges between the two
countries (see Figure 9).
The variance of wages can be decomposed as follows:

Var(w) = Û·Var(w|U=1) + (1-Û) ·Var(w|U=0) + Û·(1-Û) ·Ä,

(1)

data, however, it is difficult to explicitly compare the quantitative impact of de-unionisation on wage
inequality in the two countries.

16

where Û is the unionisation rate (actual or simulated), and Ä is the difference in mean
wages between the union and non-union sectors (E(w|U=1)-E(w|U=0)).

The first two

terms in equation (1) represent the within-group variance; the last term represents the
between-group variance.
Table 4 shows the different elements of this variance decomposition.

Consider

first the case of men in panel A. Rows 1 and 2 report the variance of (log) wages in the
union and non-union sectors, respectively.

As expected, the variance of log wages is

much smaller in the union than the non-union sector in both countries in both years.
Interestingly, the variance in the union sector is almost identical in the United Kingdom
and in the United States in the two years. By contrast, the variance in the non-union is
much larger in the United States (0.296) than in the United Kingdom (0.219) in 1983. By
1998, however, the variances are very similar in the two countries.

Consistent with

previous research, row 3 shows that the difference in mean wages between the union and
nonunion sectors (union wage gap) is always positive but smaller in the United Kingdom
than the United States.25
The same basic wage patterns can be seen in Appendix Figure 1, which shows
kernel density estimates of wages among union and non-union men.

The figure shows

that, in both countries, the wage distribution is more compressed and has a higher mean
in the union than in the nonunion sectors.
remarkably similar in 1998.

The U.K. and U.S. wage distributions look

In 1983, however, there is noticeably less difference

between the union and nonunion distributions in the United Kingdom than the United
States.

The basic patterns that emerge from this figure are, therefore, consistent with

patterns found for the variances in Table 4.
Row 4 shows that the unionisation rate among men decreased much faster (by 25
percentage points) in the United Kingdom than in the United States (10 percentage point
decline).

Row 5 reproduces the earlier finding that wage inequality --measured by the

25

For example, Stewart (1983) report standard OLS estimates of the union wage gap of about 7 percent in
the United Kingdom, compared to a range of 10 to 15 percent (Lewis, 1986) in the United States. These
estimates are not strictly comparable to those reported in Table 2 for which differences in characteristics
between the two sectors are not controlled. In Appendix Table 1, we report OLS estimates of the union
wage gap in 1983 and 1998 for the two countries. For men, our union wage gap estimates range from 0.06
to 0.12 in the United Kingdom, and from 0.12 to 0.17 in the United Kingdom, which is similar to the
estimates reported by Stewart and Lewis.

17

variance of log wages in this case—increases faster in the United Kingdom than in the
United States.
In row 6, we compute the variance of wages that would have prevailed in 1983
and 1998 if the unionisation rate had remained stable at its 1983 level using the usual
variance decomposition in equation (1) above. Column 3 of row 6 shows that the
variance of U.K. wages would have increased by 0.052 if the rate of unionisation had
remained stable, compared to an actual increase of 0.079.

In other words, de-

unionisation contributed to a 0.027 increase in the variance of wages (row 7) which
represents 34 percent of the total change.

In the United States, de-unionisation accounts

for 0.012, or 41 percent, of the 0.028 increase in the variance of wages between 1983 and
1998.
The results reported in panel B confirm the finding of the previous literature that
unions have little effect on the wage inequality for women. Relative to men, there is a
modest difference between the variance in the union and the nonunion sector (rows 1 and
2). Furthermore, the raw union wage gap (row 3) is much larger than for men, suggesting
a much larger “between-group” effect which tends to increase inequality.26 Finally, the
decline in the rate of unionisation is less than half as large for women as for men (row 4).
For all these reasons, de-unionisation accounts for less than 5 percent of the increase in
the variance of wages in either country.
In Tables 5 and 6, we provide further evidence on the effect of unions on male
wage inequality. In Table 5, we use equation (1) to compute the variance of wages under
various counterfactual assumptions about the rate of unionisation. Column 1 reports the
actual variances in the two countries.

As discussed earlier, the gap in male wage

inequality between the two countries shrinks between 1983 and 1998: the gap in the
variance declines from 0.084 to 0.033. Columns 2 and 3 show that a large portion of this
declining gap can be attributed to differences in the unionisation rate between the two
countries.

For example, column 2 shows that the U.K.-U.S. difference in the variance

26

Appendix Table 1 shows that, for women, the OLS estimates of the union wage gap are systematically
smaller than the unadjusted gaps reported in Table 2, indicating that, even in the absence of unions,
unionized women would have earned more than non-unionized women because of their human capital or
job characteristics. This confirms that finding in the literature that unions increase the between-group
variance by pushing up the wages of women who would have earned relatively high wages even in the
absence of unions.

18

would have been three times smaller if the U.S. unionisation rate had been as high as in
the United Kingdom.

Overall, this table provides additional evidence that the

convergence in the unionisation rate contributed to the convergence in male wage
inequality.
One concern with the counterfactual exercises of Table 4 and 5 is that they may
just be reflecting differences in the composition of the union and non union workforces,
as opposed to true “causal” effects of unionisation on wage inequality. For example, the
variance of wages may be smaller in the union sector because the workforce is more
homogenous than in the nonunion sector, and not because unions truly compress the
wage structure.
DiNardo, Lemieux, and Fortin (1996) suggest a simple “re-weighting” method for
controlling for differences in observable characteristics when modelling the distribution
of wages. The basic di ea is to estimate the probability that a worker with given set of
observed characteristics x is unionized in both 1983 and 1998. Call these probabilities
P83 (x) and P98 (x), respectively. The counterfactual distribution of wages that would have
prevailed in 1998 if the probability of unionisation (as a function of x) had remained as in
1983 is obtained by “re-weighting” observations for union and nonunion workers by
P83 (x)/P98 (x) and (1-P83 (x))/(1-P98 (x)), respectively. 27 Summary measures of inequality
such as the variance or the 90-10 wage differential can then be computed from this
counterfactual distribution. If it is the case that union workers have the same unobserved
characteristics as non union workers conditional on observables, then these differences
between the actual and counterfactual distributions can be taken as measuring the causal
effect of unions on wages.28
Table 6 illustrates the effect of unions on male wage inequality obtained using
this reweighting procedure.

Columns 1 and 2 show the unionisation rate and several

measures of inequality that prevailed in 1983 and 1998, respectively. The same numbers

counterfactual unionisation rate in 1998 is lower than in 1983.

We estimate these probabilities using a logit model. The explanatory variables used are a quartic

States), and dummies for race and veteran status in the United States.

19

distribution of characteristics (the x’s) have changed in a way that reduces the probability
of being unionized.
The counterfactual measures of wage inequality in column 3 are systematically
lower than in the unadjusted 1998 distribution of column 2, indicating that deunionisation could have contributed to the rise in wage inequality even when composition
effects are adjusted for. In the United Kingdom, the resulting effect of de-unionisation on
the variance of wages shown in column 4 (0.025) is very similar to the “naïve” estimate
reported in Table 4 (0.027). The estimates reported in Table 6 indicate that the faster
decline in unionisation in the United Kingdom can account for about a third of the U.K.U.S. convergence in male wage inequality between the two countries over the 1983-1998
period.

3.3. Other institutional change- Privatisation
Another reform affecting the UK labour market was the reduction of the role of the
public sector as an employer. These changes occurred directly through the privatisations
of the late 1980s and 1990s and indirectly through the contracting out of public sector
services. Public sector employment fell from 7.45 million in 1979 to 5.23 million in
1995.

In addition competitive tendering of services forced convergence of wages

between the public and private sectors for some groups of workers. By contrast, existing
research indicates that the fraction of workers in the public sector has remained more or
less constant in the United States during this period.29
Wages in the public sector are more compressed in both the United Kingdom and
the United States. Both the wage premia associated with observed skill and the wage
distribution within skill groups are smaller in the public sector.30

It seems plausible,

therefore, that the decline in the role of the public sector as an employer would have had
an significant effect on the wage distribution in the United Kingdom especially for men.
The decline is not as steep for women who are more heavily concentrated in sectors such

28

This assumption is discussed in mo re detail below

as health and education that were not directly privatised, although they became more
integrated into the private sector over the period.
It is important, however, to separate pure public sector wage compression effects
from union wage compression effects. Panel B of Table 7 shows that union membership
and public sector employment are two closely linked phenomena.

For both men and

women in 1983 and 1998, the rate of union membership in the public sector is about 40
percentage points larger than in the private sector. More importantly, coverage in the
public sector is close to 90%. The last four rows of Table 7 show, however, that most of
the difference in the wage distributions between the public and private sectors are a
consequence of the fact that unions are more present in the public than private sector.
Conditional on union status, the table shows that the standard deviation of wages is not
systematically smaller in the public than private sector. It is particularly clear in the case
of men that the key determinant of wage inequality is union status as opposed to public
sector affiliation.

This means that the effect of privatisation on the wage structure may

have occurred indirectly through decreasing the likelihood that lower-paid workers would
be unionised.
The other issue is that many workers affected by changes in the state's
employment policy are still working in the public sector. Competitive tendering, where
an activity stays in the public sector only if it has lower costs than can be found in the
private sector has meant that public and private sector wages have converged. Disney and
Gosling (1998) find that the wage distribution of low skilled men is basically identical in
the two sectors in the 1990s. This, when taken together with the points made in the
paragraph above, means that the effect of privatisation is going to be hard to uncover. In
fact when we perform the same kind of counterfactual decomposition for the public
sector than we did for unions in Table 6, we find only negligible effects on wage
inequality.

4. Effect of Reforms on Wage Inequality: Qualifications and Extensions
The empirical analysis above supports the simple story. Wage inequality increased fastest
for U.S. women during the 1980s because of the decline in the minimum wage. Over the

21

1980s and 1990s inequality increased for men faster in the United Kingdom because of
the decline in unionisation. In this section we discuss some possible arguments for and
against this view in more detail.

4.1. "Causality" of the effect of unions on wage inequality
Our findings in Section 3.2 can only be interpreted as the causal effect of the reduction of
unionisation on wage inequality if the unobserved characteristics of union members are
the same as workers not in unions. If this assumption does not hold, then we cannot tell
how much of the changes in wage inequality that we attribute to de-unionisation are a
real causal effect of de-unionisation, as opposed to spurious consequences of changes in
the distribution of unobservables between the union and nonunion sectors.

If workers

and firms respond to incentives at all, then this assumption will be violated. The real
question is therefore whether all the changes that we attribute to unionisation just reflect
differences in unobservables. This is not testable, in general, but we believe it is unlikely
for the following reasons.
First, the difference between the raw effects (Table 4) and those obtained by
controlling for a large set of explanatory variables (Table 6) are small. Unless
unobservables play a radically different role in the determination of the union status of
workers than observables like age and education, failure to control for unobservables
should not affect significantly the results. Furthermore, if selection effects are important
because firms and workers respond to wage differentials, then we know that the true
effects must lie somewhere greater than zero and less than the estimated effects.
Another reason to believe that our results can be interpreted as a “causal” effect of
unionisation is that existing studies that have modelled more explicitly the selection
problem found that doing so did not have much impact on the estimated effect of unions
on wage inequality. For example, both Freeman (1993) and Card (1992) use fixed effect
methods to control for difference in the distribution of person-specific unobservables
between the union and non-union sectors.

They conclude that these adjusted estimates

yield a very similar impact of de-unionisation on the growth in U.S. male wage inequality
than simpler cross-sectional estimates like the ones considered here.

22

A more subtle point raised by Lewis (1986) is that these various estimators only yield
a “causal” estimate of union wage effects under the assumption that the extent of
unionisation has no effect on nonunion wages.

This assumption would be violated,

however, in the presence “threat” or other general equilibrium effects. If these effects are
important, we may either be understating or overstating the “true” effect of deunionisation on wage inequality. For instance, Freeman (1996) has argued that, because
of threat effects, standard estimates of the effect of de-unionisation on wage inequality
likely understate the full effect. The basic idea si that as unions get weaker and the threat
of unionisation weakens, non-union firms no longer feel compelling to “imitate” the
wage structure of union firms to avoid unionisation. In this light Gosling (1998) relates
wages at the workplace level to the threat of unionisation when the establishment was set
up, conditional on fixed industry and establishment age/cohort effects. This paper finds
the threat of unionisation has a bigger effect on the dispersion of wages than actual union
status.
The changes in the distribution of union and nonunion wages in the U.K. documented
in Table 4 and Appendix Figure 1 are consistent with this view. There is much less
difference between the distributions of union and nonunion wages in the U.K. in 1983,
when unions are quite strong, than in 1998 or in the United States where they are weaker.
In other words, the fact that wage inequality in the nonunion sector expanded so fast in
the United Kingdom between 1983 and 1998 is consistent with the view that the threat of
unionisation subsumed during this period.

Attributing part of this expansion in wage

inequality to de-unionisation would increase substantially the estimated effect of deunionisation on wage inequality.

4.2 Comparison with other periods and other countries.
Our original motivation for looking at the effect of unions on wage inequality was
that male wage inequality expanded much faster in the United Kingdom, where the rate
of unionisation declined by 25 percentage points between 1983 and 1998, than in the
United States where it declined by less than 10 percentage points.

This “aggregate”

evidence is, in itself, inconsistent with simple selection bias explanation. If being a union

23

member was just a “label” for unobservable characteristics, then changes in wage
inequality should be unrelated, on average, with changes in the rate of unionisation.
We explore this aggregate evidence in more detail in Figure 10 which shows the
evolution of the U.K.-U.S. differences in unionization and in the variance of male wages,
respectively, between 1979 and 1998.31 Interestingly, both series exhibit a break in trend
around 1983. Between 1979 and 1983, the variance of male wages increases faster in the
United States than in the United Kingdom while unionization decreases at the same pace
in the two countries. After 1983, however, U.K. unionization rates fall faster than in the
United States while the variance of U.K. wage expands faster than in the United States.
The coincidence in the trend breaks in the two series strongly supports our earlier
conclusion about the role of unions in the relative evolution of male wage inequality in
the two countries.
A simple OLS regression of the U.K.-U.S. difference in the variance of wages on
the difference in unionization rates indicates yields an estimated coefficient of 0.22 (with
a standard error of 0.03). The R-square from the regression is 0.74, suggesting that the
differential evolution of unionization in the two countries account for most of the
divergent trends in male wage inequality. As in the case of the minimum wage analysis
for women illustrated in Figure 8, a linear trend is not statistically significant once
differences in unionization are controlled for.
Taken at face value, the estimated “aggregate” effects imply that de-unionization
accounts for 35 % of the 0.068 increase in the variance of wages in the United States
between 1979 and 1998, and for 53 % of corresponding 0.097 increase in the variance in
the United Kingdom.32

Another interesting observation is that while the rate of

unionization in 1998 is quite close to the U.S. rate for 1979 (see Figure 9), the extent of
male wage inequality in the United Kingdom in 1998 is also quite similar to the U.S. one
for 1979 (see Figure 2).

A related point is that, according to the estimated regression

model, the 16 % remaining unionization rate gap in 1998 should translate into a 0.035
variance gap which is very close to the 0.04 gap observed in Figure 10. In other words,
31

As in the case of women in Figure 8, we smooth the U.K. variance of wages using a three-year moving
average before computing the U.K.-U.S. difference in the variance of wages. We also use the overall rate
of unionisation, as opposed to the rate for men only, because of data limitations.

24

the regression estimates predict that the U.K.-U.S. variance gap would basically vanish if
the U.K. unionization rate was to decline all the way to the U.S. level.

So in addition to

explaining well the differential evolution of male wage inequality in the two countries,
U.K.-U.S. differences in unionization also seem to explain quite well the difference in the
level of wage inequality.
Interestingly, these findings are qualitatively similar to those of DiNardo and
Lemieux (1997) who show that male wage inequality increased much less in the Canada
than in the United States between 1981 and 1988. By contrast, the rate of unionisation
remained relatively stable in Canada while it dropped sharply in the United States during
this period. Putting these pieces of “aggregate” evidence together reinforces our earlier
conclusion that unionisation is an important explanation for the U.K.-U.S. convergence in
male wage inequality over the last two decades.
Comparisons with other European countries are more challenging because wagesetting institutions in countries like France and Germany are quite different from the
decentralized (or absence of) collective bargaining that prevails in the United Kingdom,
the United States, or Canada.

But as mentioned in the introduction, wage-setting

institutions remained relatively stable in those two countries compared to the United
Kingdom. The fact that inequality also remained stable and France and Germany suggest
that institutional changes can account for differential changes in wage inequality both
between the United Kingdom and the United States and between the United Kingdom
and France and Germany.

4.3. Is the decline in unionisation exogenous?
One possible objection against this aggregate evidence is that de-unionisation is
just an endogenous consequence of more fundamental labour market changes like skillbiased technical change that are the real underlying source of increase in wage
inequality.33

If this is true, however, then the rate of technical change (or other

underlying change) must have been higher in the United Kingdom than in the United
32

These estimates are obtained by multiplying the estimated coefficient of 0.22 by the respective declines
of unionization in the United States (0.11) and the United Kingdom (0.23).
33
See, for example, Acemoglu, Aghion, and Violante (2000).

25

States, France and Germany, which is neither an appealing nor a parsimonious
explanation.
The alternative explanation we implicitly have in mind here is that at least some
of the U.K. changes in unionisation have occurred because of changes in the legal
framework rather than changes to labour market and product market conditions. Under
this scenario, ascribing a causal role for the decline in unionisation is more plausible.
As Pencavel (this volume) shows, there is probably no single reason why
unionisation declined so rapidly over the 1980s and 1990s. It is, however, plausible that
legislation (especially the employment acts of 1980 and 1982) did have a crucial role.
These acts increased the costs of unionisation by removing union immunities in a
recognition dispute.34
go on strike.35

Previously unions could obtain negotiating rights by threatening to

The strike weapon was still available but unions were now liable for

monies lost to their employer as a result of the dispute. Put simply, the threat of a strike in
this instance became less credible. Disney, Gosling and Machin (1995, 1996) show that it
is conditions surrounding the workplace at set up date rather than current conditions
which determine the probability of unionisation. They also find, even after controlling for
industry level conditions of the labour and product market and macro variables at set up
date and current establishment level characteristics (such as size), that workplaces
established in the 1980s are more than 16% less likely to be unionised.36 The aggregate
decline carried on through the 1980s as the proportion of post 1980s workplaces in the
sample increased. Again, this is consistent with the view that part of the decline in
unionisation was a result of the 1980s legislative changes.
Of course it is still possible that it is not legislation which is driving the down turn
but another discrete jump in the cost of unionisation.37 This could be driven by changes in
the relative productivity of skilled or unskilled workers, changes in technology reducing
the beneficial effects of collective voice and increases in competition. The issue is then
why these caused a discrete jump in 1980. A more plausible story is that the legislative

A union is "recognised" when there it has negotiating rights with the employer for determining pay and
conditions of employment.
35
Up until July 2000, employers were under no obligation to negotiate with unions even if all of their
employees wanted it

This 1980s "shift" effect was the only establishment cohort variable to be significant in both statistical
and quantitative terms

26

changes allowed management to respond faster to these increases in costs. The story for
U.K. men is then that the change in the structure of demand increased wage inequality
both directly and because of the legislative changes indirectly through the removal of
pay-setting institutions that increased wages at the bottom end.

5. Conclusion
This paper compares trends in male and female hourly wage inequality in the United
Kingdom and the United States between 1979 and 1998. Our main finding is that the
extent and pattern of wage inequality became increasingly similar in the two countries
during this period.
labour market.

We attribute this convergence to “U.S. style” reforms in the U.K.

In particular, we argue that the much steeper decline in unionisation in

the United Kingdom explains why inequality increased faster than in the United States.
For women, we conclude that the fall and subsequent recovery in the real value of the
U.S. minimum wage explains why wage inequality increased faster in the United States
than in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, while the opposite happened during the
1990s. The introduction of the National Minimum Wage in the United Kingdom in 1999
also contributed to the convergence in labour market institutions and wage inequality
between the two countries.

Finally, our “institutional” explanation for the differential

evolution of wage inequality in the United Kingdom and the United States is also a
natural explanation for the difference between the United Kingdom and France and
Germany, where both wage inequality and wage-setting institutions remained relatively
stable over the last two decades.

for wage and salary workers age 23 to 59 earning between 1.06 and 31.8 pounds per hour
(between 1 and 30 pounds in 1996 pounds). The simulated effect of the minimum wage
(column 2) is obtained by assuming that two thirds of workers earning less than £3.6 in
the Fall of 1998 would have earned exactly the 1999 National Minimum Wage of £3.6 if
the 1999 National Minimum Wage had prevailed in 1998. The wage of the other third of
subminimum workers are assumed to be unaffected by the minimum wage. In column 4,
the (new) direct information on hourly wage rates is used instead of average hourly
earnings whenever available.

Note: Based on hourly wages of wage and salary workers age 23 to 59 earning between 1
and 30 pounds per hour (1996 pounds) in the United Kingdom, and between 2.5 and 63
dollars an hour (1996 dollars) in the United States. U.S. data are from the outgoing
rotation group files of the Current Population Survey. 1983 U.K. data are from the
General Household Survey; 1998 U.K. data are from the Fall Labour Force Survey.
Workers are divided between the “union” and “non-union” sectors on the basis of their
self-reported membership to a trade union. The simulated variance in row 6 is computed
using a standard variance decomposition formula (see note at the bottom of Table 5).

“reweighting” the 1998 data by the ratio of the predicted probabilities of union
membership in 1983 and 1998. The predicted probabilities are estimated using a logit
model for union membership. Explanatory variables used are a set of regional dummies
(ten regions and London in the United Kingdom, nine regions and SMSA status in the
United States), a dummy variable for marital status, and a set of education dummies
(seven in the United Kingdom, five in the United States) fully interacted with a fourth
degree polynomial in age. U.S. models also include dummy variables for race and

DATA APPENDIX
U.K. Data
The most consistent source of information on the distribution of hourly wages in
the United Kingdom is the Family Expenditure Survey (FES) that has collected detailed
information on weekly earnings and weekly hours of work on a consistent basis since
1966. One limitation of the FES, however, is that it contains no information on
educational achievement before 1978, and only limited information from 1978 on.38

An

alternative data set that provides more detailed information on educational achievement is
the General Household Survey (GHS) that has collected information on earnings and
hours since 1974.39 Unfortunately, as hours are not measured in a consistent fashion over
time, it is not possible to use the GHS to construct a consistent measure of hourly wage
rates over the 1980s and 1990s.
Another limitation of the FES is that it does not contain direct information on the
union status of workers.40 This information is available, however, in the 1983 GHS that
also contains information on whether individuals work in the public or private sector.
More recently, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) has been collecting detailed information
on wages, union status, and public sector affiliation each year for the mid and late 1990s.
The LFS is very similar to the U.S. Current Population Survey in terms of its purpose –
measuring labour market activity and unemployment in a timely fashion—and sample
size. The sample sizes are also considerably larger in the LFS (around 15,000 wage and
salary workers per quarter) than in the FES or the GHS (around 5,000 wage and salary
workers per year).
In light of the strengths and weaknesses of the different data sets, we use a
“multiple data set” approach for the United Kingdom. More precisely, we compute the
basic trends in wage inequality using the FES for 1978 to 1996 supplemented with the
38

The FES provides limited information on school leaving age but no information on the highest
educational degree obtained. Gosling, Machin, and Meghir (2000) nevertheless argue that the limited
information about educational achievement available in the FES is, nevertheless, sufficient for capturing
main trends in relative wages by education level.
39
See Gosling, Machin and Meghir (2000) for more detail on the strengths and weaknesses of the GHS and
FES.
40
The FES does contain a variable indicating whether the respondent has deductions from his or her
earnings for the payment of union dues. Although this is highly correlated with the union status of workers
at one point in time, changes in the way union members pay their fees over the 1980s and 1990s has meant
that it is not a good measure of changes over time

49

autumn LFS for 1997 and 1998. We analyse the effect of unionisation and public sector
affiliation on wage inequality using the 1983 GHS and the 1998 LFS. Note that we have
adjusted the 1997 and 1998 measures of wage dispersion reported in Table 1 and Figures
1 and 2 to ensure that there are no discrepancies in the series because of data differences.
More precisely, we compute adjustment factors (that we apply to the 1997 and 1998 LFS)
that are such that measures of wage dispersion in the 1996 LFS and 1996 FES are
identical.
Following the existing literature on inequality in the U.K., we also limit the
analysis to workers age 23 to 59. Real wages are obtained by deflating nominal wages
with the Consumption Price Index (Retail Price Index). To limit the effect of outliers, we
only keep observations with an hourly wage rate between one and thirty pounds (in 1996
pounds). Note that throughout the 1978 to 1998 period, there is always less than one
percent of observations with wages that are either larger than 30 pounds, or smaller than a
pound. As discussed below, one additional reason for trimming the wage data above 30
pounds is to make the U.K. data more comparable with the U.S. data for which weekly
earnings are top-coded.

U.S. Data
Since 1979, the U.S. Census Bureau has been collecting data on weekly hours,
weekly earnings, and hourly earnings (for workers paid by the hour) for all workers in the
“outgoing rotation group” of the Current Population Survey (CPS).

Beginning in 1983,

the outgoing rotation groups supplement of the CPS also asks about the union status of
workers.

Since the questions about wages, hours, and union status are asked at every

month, the resulting merged outgoing rotation group (MORG) files of the CPS provide
very large samples (around 150,000 workers per year) of wage and salary workers from
1979 to 1999. Our U.S. analysis entirely relies on this data source.
Throughout the 1979 to 1999 period, workers paid by the hour were asked their
hourly rate of pay. We use this variable, which is collected in a consistent fashion over
time, as our measure of the hourly wage rate for these workers. The MORG files of the
CPS also provide information on usual weekly earnings for all workers. For workers not

50

paid by the hour, we use average hourly earnings (weekly earnings divided by weekly
hours) as our measure of the wage rate.
Note, however, that weekly earnings are not measured in a consistent fashion over
time. From 1979 to 1993, this variable was collected by asking directly individuals about
their earnings on a weekly basis.

From 1994 to 1999, individuals had the option of

reporting their usual earnings on the base period of their choice (weekly, bi-weekly,
monthly, or annually).

Weekly earnings are then obtained by normalized the earnings

reported by workers to a weekly basis.

The available evidence does not suggest,

however, that this change in the way earnings are collected had a significant impact on
the distribution of wages.41
A potentially more important problem is that weekly earnings are top-coded at
different values for different periods throughout the sample period. Before 1988, weekly
earnings were topcoded at 999 dollars. The topcode was later increased to 1923 dollars
in 1988 and 2884 dollars in 1998. In real terms, the topcode was more than twice as
small in 1988 as in 1998.

Consequently, a much larger fraction of workers had their

earnings topcoded in 1988 than in 1998.
We adjust for topcoding by using the 1998 distribution of weekly earnings to
impute earnings in the other years where the topcode is lower.

Let tct represent the

earnings topcode in year t in real terms, and ft (y) represent the density of weekly earnings
(not topcoded) in that year. Consider the assumption that the earnings distribution in year
t between the topcode and the higher year 1998 topcode is that same as in 1998, i.e. that
ft (y|tct < y < tc98 ) = f98 (y|tct < y < tc98 ). Under this assumption, the empirical distribution
of earnings between tct and tc98 in 1998 can be used to impute earnings in year t. While it
is common to impute a fixed value of earnings to all topcoded observations, doing so
removes all the earnings variability over the topcode, which in turn understates the extent
of overall wage variability measured using the standard deviation or other distributional

41

Once the data has been trimmed for outliers and adjusted for topcoding, there is no evidence of an
unusual jump in wage inequality between 1993 and 1994.

51

measures.42 In practical terms, we stochastically impute earnings above the topcode by
drawing at random from the empirical 1998 distribution between tct and tc98 .43
One final adjustment we make is to trim observations with wages above $50
dollars and below $2 in dollars of 1989 (approximately $2.5 and $63 in 1996 dollars).
Once topcoding has been adjusted for, less than one percent of observations fall outside
of this range in any single year.

We noticed that when wage observations are not

trimmed, there is an unusual jump in most measures of wage inequality between 1993
and 1994. We conjecture that the new survey instrument used to collect weekly wages
since 1994 may have introduced more measurement error than before 1994.
For the sake of comparability with the United Kingdom, all wages measures
presented in the paper are deflated using the Consumer Price Index. Other studies have
used a the GDP deflator for personal consumption expenditures to deflate wages in part
because of concerns that changes in the CPI are biased up, which understates real wage
growth.

Unless the bias is different in the United States and the United Kingdom,

however, this should not affect comparisons of real wage growth between the two
countries. All the U.S. wage statistics reported in the paper are also weighted using the
CPS earnings weights.44
Questions about educational achievement were changed substantially in the early
1990s. Until 1991, the CPS used to ask about the highest grade (or years of schooling)
completed. Starting in 1992, the CPS moved to questions about the highest degree. To
keep a relatively consistent measure of education over time, we measure education using
five categories (high school dropout, high school graduate, some post-secondary degree
below a university bachelor’s degree, university bachelor’s degree, and post-graduate
degrees).

42

In terms of between and within-group variation of earnings above and below the topcode, standard
imputation amount to assuming there is no within-group variation above the topcode.
43
A similar approach is used by DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996) who use a reweighting procedure to
allocate values above the topcode. They also allow for the fact that the distribution of earnings depends on
standard characteristics such as age, education and gender.
44
By contrast, the U.K. data are unweighted since sample weights are not available in the FES and the
GHS. Sample weights are available in the LFS but since weighting make very little difference, we use
unweighted data for this survey as well to be consistent with the FES and the GHS.

Sample used in the estimation include wage and salary workers age 23 to 59 earning
between 1 and 30 pounds per hour (1996 pounds) in the United Kingdom, and between
2.5 and 63 dollars an hour (1996 dollars) in the United States. U.S. data are from the
outgoing rotation group files of the Current Population Survey. 1983 U.K. data are from
the General Household Survey; 1998 U.K. data are from the Fall Labour Force Survey.
Workers are divided between the “union” and “non-union” sectors on the basis of their
self-reported membership to a trade union. The “human capital” controls used in
columns 2, 3, 5, and 6 include education categories dummies (5 in the United States, 7 in
the United Kingdom), region dummies (10 regions and London in the United Kingdom, 9
regions and SMSA status in the United States) a quartic in age, marital status, and
dummy variables for nonwhites (U.S. only) and veteran status (U.S. men only). “Job
characteristics” controls in column 3 include 9 industry dummies, 12 occupation
dummies, a dummy variable for public sector affiliation, and dummy variables for firm
size and seniority. Job characteristics controls in column 6 include 46 industry dummies
