    "abstract": "\n\nThere is a strong association between writing quality in resumes for new labor market entrants and whether they are ultimately hired. We show this relationship is, at least partially, causal: in a field experiment in an online labor market with nearly half a million jobseekers, treated jobseekers received algorithmic writing assistance on their resumes. Treated jobseekers were hired 8% more often. Contrary to concerns that the assistance takes away a valuable signal, we find no evidence that employers were less satisfied. We present a model where better writing does not signal ability but helps employers ascertain ability, rationalizing our findings.\n\n",
