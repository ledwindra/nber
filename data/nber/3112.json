Although firms can perform arbitrage between domestic and foreign financial markets, the distortions in asset markets are not fully arbitraged away but instead they are transmitted to domestic goods market. The paper discusses the effects of shocks in foreign financial markets and in domestic fiscal policy. We show that the dynamics and steady states are crucially affected by capital controls.\n\n",
