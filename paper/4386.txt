THE ALLOCATION OF TIME:
YOUNG VERSUS ELDERLY
HOUSEHOLDS IN JAPAN

ABSTRACT

Our study shows that the household production theory illuminates the behavior of
households in the allocation of time and consumption expenditures. Among the noteworthy
findings derived fiom our data, the various household non-market time allocations (consequently,

market labor supply) cannot be separated from consumption expenditures. An increase in market

wage rates for both young and elderly households reduces their time spent on household nonmarket activities, such as child care, medical care, and listening to the radio and watching TV.

The high opportunity costs of waiting at the hospital clearly discourage working people from
visiting the hospital. These results show not a few similarities between the household non-market

time allocation in Japan and that to be found in the U.S.

I. Introduction
Human time is one of the most scarce resources. For understanding

the way this scarce resource is allocated to satisfy competing
human desires, we should look at the household's time allocation on

labor supply as merely one of various activities in conjunction
with household production (Becker 1965).'

Allowing for the fact that the traditional consumer demand

analysis puts great emphasis on the behavior of household
consumption expenditures, some recent empirical studiss are
•

successful in bridging the gap between the consumption expenditure

studies and the household production studies (Barnett 1979,
Kooreman and Kapteyn 1987, and Biddle and Hamermesh 1990). Although

these studies provide useful observations about household tine
allocation,2 when the various household consumption expenditures
are analyzed, the household non-market tins activities are dealt
with as a single entity, i.e., leisure. On the other hand, when the

different non-market tine activities are studied, the consumption
expenditures are treated as an aggregate commodity.

To be more consistent with theory and consequently to
understand household economic activities more deeply than the
traditional demand study, household non-market time activities,
1 See Juster and Stafford (1991) for an excellent survey of
literature on the allocation of tine.

2 The results ares Barnett (1979) rejects the separability
between consumer's labor supply and consumption of market goods;

Kooreman and Kapteyn (1987) verify variations in the tine
allocation of household non-market activities in response to
changes in the real wage rate; and Huddle and Hamermesh (1990)
focus on a major household tine allocation, i.e., sleep, and
identify wage effects on sleeping and waking non-market tine for
men and on market and waking non-market time for women.

rather than being aggregated as a single entity of leisure, need to

be simultaneously analyzed with household consumption expenditures

in a system of demand functions. This approach allows consistency

with standard economic hypotheses such as integrability,
separability,

and homogeneity. With appropriate parameter

restrictions in the system, we are able to test for separability in

household non-market time activitiee.

Furthermore, the aforementioned empirical findings on
household time allocation should be verified for different
cultures. For example, in a country like Japan, people of different

ages and different gender seem to have distinct roles in the
household and are likely to behave differently in response to
changes in available econonic incentives.4 In addition to our
concern with international comparisons regarding the household
allocation of time, we focus epecifically on some of the social
issues currently being debated in Japan.

First, the rate of reproduction among young couples has
declined sharply in recent years; the total fertility rate, which

is the number of live births by a woman during her reproductive

period, was 4.40 in 1948, and 1.75 in 1980. The most recent
available figure is 1.53 in l990.

How, then, do young Japanese

The excellent and comprehensive literature on a system of
consumer demand functions to review is Brown and Ljeaton (1972),
Diewert (1974, ch.3), Earten (1977, ch.2a), tat (1977, ch.2b),
Deaton and Muellbauer (1983), lDeaton (1986), and Blundell (1988).

The labor market in Japan still keeps the traditional
employment system although the Equal Employment Opportunity Law
went into effect in 1986 (Edwards 1988).

households use their time after having chosen a smaller family size

ever than before? Second, it is often said, somewhat cynically,

that people must wait in a "3-hour" queue at the hospital to

receive a "3-minute" medical treatment. A long queue at the
hospital reflects a high shadow price of receiving medical care.

The high opportunity costs of waiting at the hospital will

discourage working people from visiting the hospital. We
consequently pose the following question- How responsive is
hospital visiting tine to changing economic incentives?
The organization of the subsequent sections is as follows: we
report the evidence from the survey of the allocation of tine over

the period from 1976

to 1986 in section II; our analytical

framework is presented in Section III; Section IV reports the
empirical findings; and finally Section V draws our conclusion of
this study.

XI. Evidence from the Survey on Allocation of Tine
The cross-sectional data for cities with prefectural government on

tine spent on daily activities by males and females at different
age groups in 1976, 1981, and 1986 are to be found in Basic Survey

on Social Life, published by tbe Bureau of Statistics, Office of
the Prime Minister of Japan,

Of "Hours and Minutes per Day spent on Activities" in Tables
I-Cl) and (2), the reported time allocations are weekly averages of

time per day. Table I-Cl) shows the young households' (males and
females aged 25-39) allocation of time spent on work, sleep, child

care, medical care1 and Radio & TV (listening to the radio and
watching TV). The time activities of elderly households (males aged

65 and over, and females aged 60 and over) are listed in Table I(2)

The reasons for choosing these different age groups for
analysis in our study are that the former young age group has two

distinct characteristics: the members of this group are in the
middle of determining the size of their families; and most of the
males in that age group are very likely to be in the labor market.
On the other hand, the latter elderly group at the age of 65 years

old is likely to be retired from the labor market and to have
started receiving social security retirement benefits. Furthermore,

the payments for medical care of members of thie group at the
hospital are mostly covered by the public medical insurance for
elderly people.' Hence, we consider that these different age groups

'

To be more specific, elderly people aged 65 through 69, who
are confined to bed, and those aged 70 or more are covered by this
health care program.

—5-

are most likely to behave differently in response to changes in
•

economic opportunities.

Since the figures reported in the Tables are self•

explanatory, we mainly discuss the time allocations of males and
females aged 25-39 in Table

I-Cl).

The male market daily working

hours rose from 7 hours 22 minutes a day in 1976 to 7 hours 49
minutes in 198G.' Since these reported figures are weekly averages

of 7 days, if Japanese people hypothetically work the same amount

of

hours for 5 days a week similar to the western standard, their

working hours are nearly 10 hours a day on average.t

As regards sleeping hours, males

"with

a job" sleep shorter

hours than males "without a job", roughly by 30 minute a day.9 Such
a large difference, however, vanishes in the case of females. Males

sleep longer hours a day than females in Japan. As is to be
•

expected in Japan, males, regardless of their attachment to the
labor markat, spend little time on child care, while females spend

a substantial amount

of

their tine on providing this care. Those

females "without a job" spend twice as much time or more each day
The most recent figures on the average monthly working hours
per worker in the manufacturing industry in 1990 are 178.2 hours
in firms with 30-99 workers; 174.8 hours in those with 100-499
workers; and 177.0 hours in those with 500 workers or more (White
Paper on Labor, Ministry of Labor, 1991, p. 287: "Roudou Hakueyo"
in Japanese). Note that the average monthly working hours are not
age and male specific, but induetry specific values. Hence, these

average monthly working hours are somewhat different from the
male's average daily working hours reported in the text.

9.6 percent of the firms with 30 or more workers have a
regular weekly 2-day off schedule in 1989, which cover 36.9 percent

of total employment in industries (The Current Conditions of
Women's Labor, Ministry of Labor, 1990, p. 594).
Middle and Hamermeeh (1990) report that "Time spent sleeping
is inversely related to both the wage and time spent in the labor
market (p. 941)."

-6-

on child care than working females, who spend three hours or so on
average.

Concerning medical care, males "with a job" have much less
tins spent on medical care than males "without a job", while this
is not so for females.'1 To account for this difference in medical

care for males, two testable hypotheses may be offered: the first
one, for which we actually make a test in this study, is that males

in the labor market face high opportunity costs in visiting the

hospital and hence they visit less often as their economic
opportunities rise, while the income effects work toward more
medical care; end the second one is that males who are not in the
labor market are more likely to he ill, and the "not in the labor
force" nay be an indicator of poor health status. Hence those out
of the labor force spend more hours on medical care than those in

the market. In this second case, economic opportunities, e.g.,
their potential market wage rates, will exert little influence on

their choice of visiting the hospital. Finally, both males and

females "without a job" do spend much more time on Radio & TV

(i.e.,

listening to the radio and watching TV) than those "with

a

job". This phenomenon again seems to be indicative of the
difference in their economic opportunities. In sum, there exist
marked behavioral differences in the allocation of time between

young persons "with a job" and those "without a job" and also
between males and females of the sane age group. These obser-catione

1981, and 1986 on the allocation of time for young males and
females both aged 25-39 as well as for elderly males aged 65 or
more and those females aged 60 or more.16 We focus on their

tine

allocations on sleep, child care, medical care, radio & TV, and all

other non-market time activities. These time data are collected

from the Basic Survey on Social Life. In the system, we also
include five categories of household market

goods and services

consumption: food, housing, clothing, medical

care, and all

others.1' Among the total fifteen demand functions in the system,
we delete the equation of the household consumption expenditure on
"All Others" to avoid the simgularity in the estimation.1!

households behave or not as the traditional

' Each

"

Strictly

speaking, in grouping numerous household goode and
services consumptions into different but appropriate categories, we
have to verify whether separability condition is met or not for
each item. This is, however, beyond our scope in the present study.
Therefore, we follow the conventional classifications in Annual
Report on the Family Income and Expendjture Survey by Statistics
Bureau, Management and Coordination Agency in Japan.

(d.f.=58),

we cannot accept

the separability restrictions at the significance level

0.01,

as reported in Table II.' Therefore, we consider that household
decisions on time allocation is jointly determined with household
decisions on consumption expenditures. To put it differently, the
household labor supply is not the result of a simple labor-leisure

choice, but the result of tine activities in conjunction with
household production. Hence, we support the findings of Barnett
(1979) with our own Japanese data.

Tables III-(l) and (2) report the estimates of the wage and

income elasticities of the time activities for the young
households.2° In order to have a general view of the wage and

income effects on their time activities, we begin with the
estimates of "All Households' of young males and females, as shown

labor market (i.e., "Labor Supply" in Table) but to reduce his
hours spent on the other household non-market activities including

"Medical Care".22 The male wage effects on female time activities
are positive regarding the hours of her sleeping and listening to

the radio and watching TV (i.e., "Radio & TV" in Table) but
negative regarding all her other time activities including her
labor supply." As regards the effects of Wtmj.p as the wage rate
rises, the male enjoys more hours of sleeping, medical care, and
listening to the radio and watching TV, while the female works more

in the labor market. Another point concerning young households is

that wage effects on "Child Care" for both males and females are
negative, so we can conclude that they tend to choose to have less

number of children as their market opportunities improve. With
respect to income effects, as the household income rises, the young

households spend more hours on household non-market time
activities, i.e., producing more household non-market cocwnodities,

but reduces their hours of work in the market.
Now we will highlight and discuss in a little more detail the
important results concerning young working households, as reported
in Tables III- (1) and (2) .' As regards "Both in the Labor Market"

under (B) in Table III- (1), the male (or female) wage effect on his

elasticity of "male's all other non-market time activities" is
negative, -0.746.

"

The wage elasticity on "female's all other non-market time
activities" is -0.188.

Since there are only a few qualitative differences in the
empirical results between "Both in the Labor Market" as reported
under (B) in Table III-(l) and "Only Male in the Labor Market"
under (C) in Table flI-(2), we focus only on those results of the
former.

(or her) sleeping is positive and statistically significant in
contrast to the U.S. experience, where the effects are negative
(Biddle and Hamermesh 1990) 2S The positive estimates for Japanese

working males and females are, however, not a puzzling result.
Since our data on tine allocation are weekly averages of tine per
day, a working couple may make up for a lack of weekdays' sleeping

hours by sleeping more over the weekend."

Also, as the market wage rates increase, both males and
females increase their working hours: the estimated labor eupply

elasticity for males is 0.369 and that for females is O.63l.'
These values are comparable with those reported by the previous
studies (Shinada and Higtchi 1985 and Yamada, et al, 1987). The
cross wage effects are negative for both males and females. That

is, a rise in the partner's market wage encourages his (or her)
withdrawal from the labor market. The estimated owii

wage and income

elasticities of female labor supply are nearly twice as large as

' The estimated own wage elasticity of sleeping for males is
0.153, while the value is 0.147 for females: a ten-percent rise in

male wage rate increases his average sleeping time by about I
minutes a day (10 x 0.00153 x 463 minutes (see, in Table I-Cl),
that a typical male aged 25-39 9flth a Job sleeps 7:43, i.e., 463
minutes a day, in 1966))
" In Japanese cartoons, it is very coon to have a character
of a prime age working male who has no energy left with himself on
a weekend due to his exceseive work during weekdays, e.g., daily

overtime work till nearly midnight. He in the cartoon loves
sleeping at home on the weekend, although his wife and children are

expecting that he would take his family out such as a driving,
shopping, and so forth. They always wait a long timel This cynicism
is not totally false.
1

27 These labor supply elasticities are not directly obtained
from the estimated coefficients in the system of demand functions,

since the share equations of male and female labor supply are
excluded from the system by theory. The elasticities are simply a

weighted average of the own wage elasticities of non-market
activities.

-16-

those for males. This is probably because the female has more
alternatives in allocating her tine than does her husband, since a
married woman in Japan normally specializes in household production

and is consequently less attached to the labor market than her
spouse.
Increases in hours of sleeping and labor supply for both males

and females due to an increase in their market wage rates reduce

their household non-market activities such as "Child Care",
"Medical Care", and "Radio & TV". These findings are congruent with

those drawn in the case of two-earner U.S. households by Koorenan

and Kapteyn (1987). With respect to the "Child Care", the higher
the opportunity cost to raise children for a typical working young
couple the smaller will be the size of family members chosen by the

household. Contrary to the negative wage effects on child care, a

rise in household income encourages them to spare more time for
child care. That is, an increase in household income raises the
number of children (and/or mayhe the quality of children too) in
the household.2"

With our study of the wage effect on the tine allocation on
medical care, the result is negative (as is to be expected for both

Therefore, if t is fixed, the number of children rises as the

household income increases. On the other hand, if N is fixed, the

any other substitutes)" of child will increase as the income rises.
In realty, a mixture of the positive income effects seem to be held
on both t and N.

working males and fenales), but statistically insignificant." A

one-percent rise in male wage rate reduces his time spent on
medical care, e.g., waiting at the hospital, by about 3 percent

(i.e., -3.009 for male "Medical Care" under W1 and -2.963 for

female "Medical Care" under W±mi.) Putting it differently, a
typical working male reducee his time spent on hospital visite by
about 6 minutes a week in reeponee to a ten-percent increase in his

wage rate [7 days a week x 10 x -0.03009 x 3 minutes spent on
"Medical Care" by males "with a job" in 1986 in Table I-Cl)].

rarely to be found waiting their turns in the busy lobbies of
hospitals all day long.

Now we will discuss the empirical results on elderly
households, as reported in Tables IV-(l) and (2). About the "All
Households" under (A) in Table IV-(l), the W,_1 effect is positive

on male "labor supply" and a rise in the wage rate encourages his
spouse to take more "Sleep' and "Child Care" of, presumably, their
grand-children. But, for the W_,_1. effect which is positive on her

market labor supply, the male is not so helpful for caring grandchildren. In other words, when elderly people are not responsible
for taking care of their grand-children, as their market economic

opportunities rise, they seem not to retire early from the labor
market.
The most striking findings for working elderly males, as shown

" This wage effect on males is negative and statistically

significant for the case of "All Households" reported under (A) in
Table XII- (1).

-18-

under (B) in Table IV-{l) and under (C) in Table IV-(2), are that

the wage effects on their time spent on "Sleep", "Child Care",
"Medical Care", and "Radio & IV" are all negative and statistically

significant)C The negative wage effect on "Medical Care" and the
positive effect on "Labor Supply" for working elderly males clearly

indicates that their condition of good health postpones their
retirement from the labor market, in sharp contrast to the positive

wage effect on "Medical Care" for the "Neither one in the Labor
Market" household as reported under CD) in Table IV-(2).3' As for

the Wf,• effects on her household non-market time activities, a
general impression is that the negative wage effects dominate, but

that they are statistically much weaker in significance than with
the male counterparts,

In sum, our empirical findings show that household decisions
on the allocation of time is not independent of household decisions

on consumption expenditures. An increase in wage rates stimulates

the market labor supply for both young and elderly people, but
generally reduces their non-market time activities. On the other
hand, household income has dominant positive effects on the time
allocations on sleeping, child care, medical care, and listening to

the radio and watching TV.

These qualitative results are similar to those for working
young males except for the effect on "Sleep", but the statistical
results for working young males are much weaker than those with
working elderly males,

' As often done in the literature of labor economics, A wage
equation for non-participants in the labor market should be
estimated in an appropriate manner. Since we are not successful in
collecting the relevant variables for the equation, we instead use

the industry average wage rates for the non-participants.
Therefore, our results for them are only suggestive.

-19-

V. Conclusions and Implications
In this study, by using the pooled time series data in 1976, 1981,

and 1986, we analyze the allocation of time of young (aged 25-39)

and elderly (aged 65 or more) households in Japan. We estimate a

system of demand functions, in which the equations of household
non-market time activities are simultaneously estimated with those

of household consumption expenditures.
Among the noteworthy findings derived from our data, first of
all, in our test for separability in the household time allocation,

we cannot accept the separability restrictions. Hance, as has
already been suggested by some U.S. data, our Japanese data show

that household non-market time l1ocations (consequently, its

market labor supply)

are not separable from consumption

expenditures.
Secondly, an increase in ths market wage rates for both young

and elderly households reduces their time spent on the household

non-market activities such as child care, medical care, and
listening to the radio and watching TV. We consider one reason why

young working couples have smaller families in recent years to be
bound up with the improvements in their economic opportunities in
the labor market. Since fewer children are born and fewer working

people are now supporting currently retired people than in the
past, and since these trends will continue in the near future,
raising the retirement age reconmiendsd by the Japanese government

would encourage people to work longer and thus would reduce the
ratio of retired to working ags people.

Thirdly, as hypothesized, the high opportunity costs of
waiting at the hospital clearly discourage working people from

-20-

visiting the hospital. Requiring firms

to have

their own

clinics

and encouraging hospitals to make appointments for patients would
reduce waiting time.

As a concluding remark, our study shows that the household
production theory iliwninates the behavior of households in the
allocation of time and consumption expenditures. The results of our

empirical model based on the theory show not a few similarities

between the forms of household behavior in different cultures,
e.g., the U.S. and Japan.

Note: The own wage elasticity is defined as ei,i = (r1/e)+s1-1; the
cross wage elasticity is as ci, = (rjj/sj)+s; and income elasticity
= (h11,/e1)+1. All the elasticities are evaluated at
is as
the sample means. s1 is the total expenditure share of i-th input.
The standard errors are in parenthesee.
