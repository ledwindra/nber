ABSTRACT
This research explores the origins of loss aversion and the variation in its prevalence across
regions, nations and ethnic group. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that the
evolution of loss aversion in the course of human history can be traced to the adaptation of
humans to the asymmetric effects of climatic shocks on reproductive success during the epoch in
which subsistence consumption was a binding constraint. Exploiting regional variations in the
vulnerability to climatic shocks and their exogenous changes in the course of the Columbian
Exchange, the research establishes that consistent with the predictions of the theory, individuals
and ethnic groups that are originated in regions marked by greater climatic volatility have higher
predisposition towards loss-neutrality, while descendants of regions in which climatic conditions
tended to be spatially correlated, and thus shocks were aggregate in nature, are characterized by
greater intensity of loss aversion.

Introduction

The intriguing phenomenon of loss aversion has been central for the understanding of human behavior
in the past few decades. The predisposition of individuals to view asymmetrically losses and gains
has been documented in a wide range of experimental and empirical studies (Tversky and Kahneman,
1991; Kahneman et al., 1991; Benartzi and Thaler, 1995) and its remarkable implications has been
established in the economic, political and social arenas.1 Nevertheless, despite the importance of this
phenomenon for the understanding of human and social behavior, and conceivably in the exploration
of the roots of comparative economic development across globe, the origins of loss aversion and the
variation in its intensity across societies have remained largely obscured.
This research explores the roots of loss aversion and the variation in its prevalence across regions,
nations, and ethnic groups. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically that the evolution
of loss aversion in the course of human history reflects the adaptation of humans to an ancestral
environment in which, in light of the existence of a binding subsistence consumption constraint, adverse
climatic shocks could have resulted in extinction, while favorable ones generated only temporary gains
in reproductive success.
The study develops an evolutionary theory that captures the fundamental asymmetry that the
Malthusian environment has generated with respect to the attitude of individuals towards gains and
loses in productivity, and thus with respect to the evolution of loss aversion. In light of existing evidence that resources per capita during the Malthusian era where in the proximity of the subsistence
consumption constraint, lineages who were subjected to significant adverse productivity shocks during
this period had become extinct, while those who had experienced transitory favorable climatic conditions had a larger reproductive success only temporarily (Ashraf and Galor, 2011). Thus, in view of
the subsistence consumption constraint, individuals who were characterized by loss aversion had chosen to engage in safe agricultural practices that secured their subsistence consumption and minimized
the risk of catastrophic realizations that would inevitably bring their dynasties to extinction. In contrast, individuals with greater propensity towards loss-neutrality may had favored riskier agricultural
practices that were associated with higher expected return as well as higher expected extinction.
In a Malthusian environment in which climatic shocks are aggregate in nature, individuals who

were engaged in risky agricultural practices would have likely been affected by a catastrophic climatic
realization that could have brought them to extinction. Hence, in an environment that is largely
characterized by aggregate productivity shocks the trait of loss aversion, and the associated choice of
the safer production mode, would have been favored by the forces of natural selection and would have
dominated the population in the long run. Furthermore, in a Malthusian environment characterized
by greater climatic volatility, although the trait of loss aversion would have still maximize the survival probability of each dynasty, loss-neutral dynasties who had experienced a sequence of (unlikely)
realizations of favorable climatic conditions had a significantly higher reproductive success and have
ultimately dominated the population in the long run.
The theory generates two fundamental testable predictions about the climatic origins of the observed predisposition toward loss-aversion. It suggests that individuals, as well as societies, that are
originated in regions of the world in which climatic shocks tended to be spatially correlated, and thus
aggregate in nature, would be characterized by greater intensity of loss aversion. In contrast, descendants of regions of the world that were characterized by greater climatic volatility will tend to exhibit
a higher degree of loss-neutrality.
Exploiting variations in the degree of loss aversion among second generation migrants in Europe
and the US, as well as across precolonial ethnic groups, the research establishes that consistent with
the predictions of the theory, individuals and ethnic groups that are originated in regions in which
climatic conditions tended to be spatially correlated, and thus shocks were aggregate in nature, are
characterized by greater intensity of loss aversion, while descendants of regions characterized by greater
climatic volatility have higher propensity towards loss-neutrality.
The empirical analysis is conducted at different layers that are designed to establish the robustness
of the findings in distinct samples and units of analysis. It exploits variation in preferences and
behavior across individuals and ethnic groups, based on the European Social Survey (ESS), General
Social Survey (GSS), World Value Survey (WVS), the Ethnographic Atlas (EA), and the Standard
Cross Cultural Sample (SCCS). In particular, the analysis explores: (i) variation in loss-aversion across
second-generation migrants in the US as well as Europe, accounting for time-invariant host country
fixed effects, potentially confounding geographical characteristics of the parental countries of origin,
as well as migrants’ individual characteristics such as, age, gender, income and eduction; (ii) variation
in loss-aversion across individuals within each country, accounting for a wide range of potentially

2

confounding geographical characteristics, regional fixed effects, as well as individual characteristics,
such as age, gender, income and eduction; (iii) variation in loss-aversion across precolonial ethnic
groups, accounting for potentially confounding regional fixed effects, geographical characteristics as
well as ethnographic characteristics such as the intensity of agriculture, settlement structure, the use
of the plow.
In light of the predictions of the theory, the prevalence of loss aversion is linked to intertemporal climatic volatility as well as special correlation in climatic conditions. A-priori one could have captured
these climatic characteristics using either temperature or precipitation. However, as established in
the empirical section, while productivity in the Malthusian era is significantly correlated with various
characteristics of temperature, it is orthogonal to the corresponding measures of precipitation. Thus
the proposed hypothesis is examined based on the impact of measures of intertemporal temperature
volatility, as well as spatial correlation in temperature on the intensity of loss aversion.2 In particular, following the methodology of Durante (2009), these measures are constructed based on monthly
temperatures over the period 1900-2000, using the 0.5◦ × 0.5◦ resolution of the Climatic Research
Unit (CRU). Moreover, the study establishes the robustness of the results for the use of temperature
volatility over the periods 500CE - 2000CE and 500CE - 1000CE.3
Variations in the prevalence and the distribution of loss-aversion across individuals is captured
by a variety of newly introduced measures of the intensity of loss aversion. Exploiting the ESS,
GSS and the WVS, the degree of loss aversion is captured by individual’s ranking of potential job
characteristics. In particular, preference for job security over other characteristics such as salary and
promotion opportunities are used as a proxy for loss-aversion. Importantly, since conceivably a layoff
is typically only a transitory phenomenon, preferences for job security over higher salary do not simply
represent the trade-off between potential gains and loss of income, and thus risk aversion, but rather
the reluctance of individuals to lose something that is in their possession, and thus loss aversion.
Differences in the prevalence and the distribution of loss-aversion across ethnic groups are captured
by two ethnographic characteristics reported by the EA and the SCCS. In particular, loss aversion is
captured by parental preferences for sleeping in closed proximity to their infants; an overly cautious
2

Loss aversion is indeed affected by the various measures of temperature rather than by the corresponding measures
of precipitation.

Potential concerns about changes in climate over the course of human history that is relevant for the evolution of
loss aversion, appears are largely misplaced. As established in the empirical section, climatic volatility and temperature
spatial correlation over the past 100 year period are highly correlated with the corresponding climatic characteristics in
the past 2000 years.

behavior driven by the fear of losing a child during his sleep, despite the low probability that is
associated with this event. Alternatively, loss aversion is captured by the prevailing types of games
played by members of an ethnic group. In particular, loss-aversion among members of the ethnic
group, is captured by the prevalence of games that are predominantly strategy-based, rather than
those governed by chance.
The first part of the empirical analysis explores the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility
and temperature spatial correlation on the preferences of second-generation migrants in Europe and
the US for job security versus salary and other characteristics, as reported by the ESS and the GSS.
In line with the predictions of the theory, the analysis establishes: (i) a statistically and economically
significant adverse effect of temperature volatility in the parental country of origin on the degree of
loss aversion among second-generation migrants, and (ii) a statistically and economically significant
positive effect of temperature spatial correlation in the parental country of origin on the degree of
loss aversion among second-generation migrants. Moreover, consistent with the proposed theory that
underlines the role of intergenerational transmission in the evolution of loss aversion, the estimated
effects of temperature volatility and spatial correlation in the parental country of origin (rather than
those in country of residence) on loss aversion, capture the culturally-embodied, intergenerationallytransmitted effect, rather than the direct effect of geography. Furthermore, the findings are robust
to the inclusion of country-of-birth fixed-effects, and for accounting for the potentially confounding
effects of a wide range of geographical characteristics at the parental county of origin, the years elapsed
since the parental country transitioned to agriculture, and a range of individual characteristics, such
as age, gender, education and income.
The results are further robust to a large number of placebo and robustness tests. In particular, the
analysis suggests that intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation have
no effect on the valuation of job characteristics that are orthogonal to the loss aversion (e.g., salary
vs. promotion). Moreover, while loss aversion may be correlated with other cultural dimensions (e.g.,
obedience, altruism, attitudes towards equality and preference for strong government), the climatic
conditions that governed the evolution of loss aversion, do not have an effect of the evolution of
these cultural traits as well as others (e.g., long term orientation, attitudes towards gender roles and
tradition). In particular, lending further credence to the hypothesis that the geographical origins of
loss aversion are distinct from those of risk aversion, temperature volatility and temperature spatial

4

correlation are not associated with the attitude toward risk aversion, and the propensity towards risk
aversion has no impact on the effect of the climatic characteristics on loss aversion.
The second part of the empirical analysis focuses on the effect of temperature intertemporal volatility and spatial correlation on the variation in loss-aversion across individuals within each country, as
reported by the WVS. These results further support the proposed theory. They establish a statistically and economically significant negative association between temperature volatility and degree of
loss aversion among individuals, and a statistically and economically significant positive association between temperature spatial correlation and loss aversion, as captured by their preferences of job security
versus other characteristics. The findings are robust to the inclusion of country-of-birth fixed-effects,
and for accounting for the potentially confounding effects of a wide range of geographical characteristics, as well as individual characteristics, such as age, gender, education and income. Importantly,
the results are unaffected qualitatively if one adjust the climatic variables for the ancestral composition of the contemporary population, reinforcing the hypothesized intergenerationally-transmitted
and culturally-embodied nature of the effect.
The third part of the empirical analysis explores the effect idiosyncratic and aggregate components
of climatic shocks on the degree of loss aversion across precolonial ethnic groups. In particular,
it establishes a statistically and economically significant negative association between temperature
volatility and loss aversion and a statistically and economically significant positive association between
temperature spatial correlation and loss aversion, as reported by the EA. Moreover, placebo tests,
establishes that the this climatic conditions are not associated with a wide range of other ethnographic
characteristics, such as, sex taboos, political integration, inherited property rights, gender roles in
agriculture, attitude towards premarital sex and belief in the evil eye. Thus, in line with the proposed
theory, this evidence suggests that the hypothesized evolutionary process had matured already in the
precolonial period.
Moreover, the ethnic level analysis permits the exploration of the effect climatic conditions on
degree of loss aversion, as captured by the observed human behavior. First the study explores the
association between climatic characteristics, and their hypothesized impact on loss aversion, and the
degree of diversification in the production of subsistence consumption. A-priori, one would have
expected, that in a more volatile environment the degree of diversification will be larger. Nevertheless,
the findings suggests that ethnic groups that are characterized by greater climatic volatility tend to

5

diversify less, reflecting the selection of loss-neutrality in a volatile environment, and thus production
choices that are based on higher rates of return rather than loss-avoidance. Second, the study examines
the association between climatic characteristics, and their hypothesized impact on loss aversion, and
the choices of crops that are potentially less vulnerable to climatic fluctuations. In particular, due to
the greater resistance of roots and tubers, in comparison to cereals, to climatic volatility, one would
have expected, a-priori, that roots and tubers would be adopted in a more volatile environment.
Nevertheless, the findings suggest that, among ethnic-groups that were situated in a regions with
greater temperature volatility, roots or tubers are less likely to be the dominating crops, reflecting the
selection of the trait of loss-neutrality in a volatile environment and thus choices that are based on
higher rates of return rather than loss-avoidance.
The research represent that first attempt to shed light on the geographical origins of loss aversion
and the distribution of this trait across the globe. Moreover, it contributes to the understanding of the
evolution of preferences (e.g., Bisin and Verdier, 2001; Galor and Moav, 2002), and the biogeographical
roots of preferences (e.g., Alesina et al., 2013; Galor and Özak, 2016; Giuliano and Nunn, 2017) and
comparative economic development (e.g., Diamond, 1997; Ashraf and Galor, 2011, 2013; Spolaore and
Wacziarg, 2013; Mayshar et al., 2016).

An Evolutionary Theory of Loss Aversion

This section advances an evolutionary theory that captures the critical role of climatic forces in the
evolution of loss aversion in the course of human history. The theory suggests the contemporary
distribution of the intensity of loss aversion across individuals can be traced to the adaptation of their
ancestral populations to the climatic forces that affected their productivity during Malthusian era.4
The model captures the fundamental asymmetry that the Malthusian environment has generated
with respect to the attitude of individuals towards gains and loses in productivity, and thus with
respect to the evolution of loss aversion. In light of existing evidence that resources per capita during
the Malthusian era where in the proximity of the subsistence consumption constraint, lineages of
individuals who were subjected to significant adverse transitory productivity shocks during this period
had become extinct, while lineages of individuals who had experience favorable climatic realization had

ancient feature of human preference.

6

a larger reproductive success only temporarily (Ashraf and Galor, 2011; Vollrath, 2011; Dalgaard and
Strulik, 2015). Hence, in view of constraining effects of the subsistence consumption constraint during
the Malthusian epoch, individuals who were characterized by loss aversion would have chosen safe
agricultural practices that would assure their subsistence consumption while minimizing the risk for
catastrophic realizations that would inevitably make their dynasties extinct. In contrast, individuals
who had not assign asymmetric weight to gains and loses may had favored riskier agricultural practices
that were associated with higher expected return and higher risk of extinction.
In a Malthusian environment characterized by aggregate productivity shocks, individuals who
were engaged in a risky agricultural practices would have eventually affected by catastrophic climatic
realization that would have become extinct. Hence, in an environment characterized by aggregate
productivity shocks the trait of loss aversion, and the associated choice of the safer production mode,
would have been favored by the forces of natural selection and would have dominated the population in
the long run. However, in a Malthusian environment characterized by idiosyncratic shocks, although
the trait of loss aversion would have still maximize the survival probability of each individual, some
dynasties of individuals, who had not assigned asymmetric weight to gains and loses, would have
experienced a long and (and very unlikely) realization of optimal climatic conditions. Hence, these
few loss-neutral dynasties would have generated a significantly higher reproductive success and would
have ultimately dominated the population in the long run.

2.1

The Basic Structure of the Model

Consider an overlapping-generations economy in a Malthusian stage of development. In every time
period the economy is populated by a continuum of two-period lived individuals who are identical
in all respects except for their degree of loss aversion. Loss Aversion is transmitted within each dynasty with alteration. Individuals have access to two production modes. A safe mode that generates
subsistence consumption and a risky one that is associated with a higher consumption in a favorable
climatic state and consumption below subsistence (leading to extinction) in an adverse climatic state.
Individuals allocate their disposable income between consumption and fertility, while facing a subsistence consumption constraint. Thus, in line with the one of the main characteristics of the Malthusian
epoch, richer individuals have higher reproductive success and the effect of loss aversion on the choice
of the production mode affect the composition of loss aversion in society.

7

2.2

Production

In every time period two production modes are feasible in the economy: a safe mode and a risky mode.
The safe mode of production is associated with hunting, gathering or the cultivation of crops that are
largely insensitive to climatic conditions (e.g., roots and tubers), while the risky mode of production
is associated with the cultivation of crops that generate higher expected yield but are more sensitive
to climatic conditions (e.g., cereal).
s , is
The yield generated by individual i of generation t using the the safe mode of production, yit

= ȳ,

(1)

where the yield under safe mode of production, ȳ, exceeds the subsistence consumption constraint (i.e.,
ȳ > c̃). In particular, in line with the dominating characteristics of the Malthusian epoch, this yield
permits each individual to satisfy the subsistence consumption constraint and their fertility rates are
at the replacement level. Hence, in the absence of technological progress, if all individual would choose
the safe mode of production, the economy will be in a Malthusian steady-state where consumption is
constant at the subsistence level and population is constant as well.

where as depicted in Figure 1, y(τit ) is a symmetric, Strictly concave, hump-shaped function which
attains its maximum at τ ∗ .5 The optimal climatic conditions, τ ∗ , can be viewed as the ones to which
crops have adapted in the long-run and hence deviations from τ ∗ result in a lower yield.
In particular, an individual i in period t will experience with probability p the optimal climatic
conditions, τ ∗ , whereas with probability (1 − p) the individual will experience either a positive or
negative deviation of magnitude ∆ from the optimal climatic conditions (e.g., sub-optimally low or

The qualitative results would not be affected if y(τit ) will be a hump shaped function of τit that is not symmetric

Hence, an adverse climatic realization would not permit individual i who is engaged in the risky
production mode to satisfy the subsistence consumption constraint, i.e., y l < c̃. In contrast, a favorable
climatic realization would generate a yield that is higher than the one obtained under the safe mode
of production and would assure consumption above subsistence, i.e., y h > ȳ > c̃. Moreover, while the
high yield realization under the risky mode of production is independent of the of magnitude of the

9

deviation from the optimal climatic conditions, ∆, the low yield realization is negatively affected by
∆, (i.e., ∂y l /∂∆ < 0.)
Climatic volatility is spatially correlated across individuals within a generation (while being independent over time). In particular, a fraction µ ∈ [0, 1] of individuals experience an identical (aggregate)
realization of the climatic shock based on the distribution specified in (3), whereas a faction 1 − µ
experience idiosyncratic realizations based on the same distribution.6,7

2.3

Individuals

In every period t, a continuum I of two-period lived individuals is born. Individuals are ex-ante
identical in all respects except for their degree of loss aversion with respect to consumption. The
extant of loss aversion is heterogeneous within each generation and is transmitted intergenerationally,
from parent to child, without alteration. The initial distribution of loss aversion across types is uniform
over the existing range of the loss aversion parameter.
In the first period of their life – childhood – individuals are passive economic agents and they
consume part of their parental resource. In the second period of their life - adulthood – individuals
are active economic agents. Based on their degree of loss aversion, they choose their desirable mode of
production, they produced, and optimally allocate the resulted yield between consumption and child
rearing.
In light of the association between the degree of loss aversion and the choice of the production mode,
the nature of the climatic shocks (i.e, their degree of spatial correlation) determines individuals’ yield
and hence their reproductive success and consequently contributes to the evolution of loss aversion in
the population.

2.3.1

Preferences, Constraints, and Optimization

Individuals derive utility from consumption and fertility. The preferences of an adult individual i
in period t are represented by a utility function that reflect the asymmetric utility that individuals
attribute to gain and losses in consumption, with respect to a reference consumption level, c̃. In
6

This specification assures that the idiosyncratic and the aggregate dimensions of climatic volatility are orthogonal
to one another. Hence, it permits the examination of the impact of: (i) changes in cross-individual correlation of shocks
(i.e., µ), holding the distribution of the shocks from point of view of individual i unchanged; (ii) changes in the climatic
volatility parameter (i.e., ∆), holding the spatial correlation unchanged.
7
The structure of shocks in the model is similar the the structure of shocks in Robson (1996)’s theoretical exploration
of the implications of aggregate and idiosyncratic risk for the evolution of expected utility.

10

particular, the level of utility of an adult i in period t, uit , is:8

uit = ui (cit , nit ) =




(1 − γ)[ln(cit ) − ln c̃] + γ ln(nit + )

if cit ≥ c̃



 1 (1 − γ)[ln(cit ) − ln c̃] + γ ln(nit + )

if cit < c̃,

θi

(5)

where (i) the subsistence consumption constraint, c̃, is the natural reference point of consumption for
each individual i;9 (ii)  > 0 is a positive parameter that is designed to assure that the level of utility
will be bounded from below;10 (iii) 1/θi ∈ [1, ∞) is the coefficient of loss aversion of individual i, where
θi is uniformly distributed across dynasties in period 0 , i.e.,11,12

θi ∼ U (0, 1).

(6)

Consumption above subsistence, c̃, is considered by the individual to reflect a gain with respect to
the natural reference consumption level, whereas consumption below subsistence, c̃, is considered by
the individual to reflect a loss with respect to this natural reference consumption level. Hence, the
parameter θi ∈ (0; 1] is inversely related to the degree of the individual’s loss aversion with respect to
subsistence consumption. In particular, θi = 1 corresponds to the conventional ‘loss-neutral’ behavior,
while 0 < θi < 1 reflects loss aversion.
An adult i in period t is subject two two constraints: A budget constraint and a subsistence
consumption constraint. Once the choice of the production mode is made and uncertainty is realized,
8

The use of a utility function, with differential level of constant relative risk aversion with respect to consumption
and fertility, would generate similar qualitative results, further highlighting that, as established in the Appendix, the
evolution of loss-aversion is independent of the evolution risk-aversion, and is not governed by the same climatic forces.
In particular, the utility function can take the form:

9

The choice of c̃ as the reference point of the utility function is a natural one in light of the asymmetric effects of
climatic shocks on reproductive success around this point. Nevertheless, any reference point in the interval (yl ; ȳ] would
not affect the qualitative analysis.
10
This assumption assures that some individuals will be willing to choose the risky mode of production despite that
fact that an adverse climatic realization may bring their dynasty to extinction.
11
While the qualitative analysis is unaffected if non-uniform distributions is postulated, this assumption simplifies the
exposition considerably.
12
Under this assumption the coefficient of loss aversion, 1/θi , is bounded from below by 1, which corresponds to the
case of Loss Neutrality. Allowing for the presence of loss loving individuals in the initial population (i.e., θi > 1 will not
affect the qualitative predictions.

11

an adult i in period t allocates the resulting income, yit , between consumption and fertility.

cit + ρyit nit ≤ yit ,

(7)

where ρ > 0 is the time cost of raising a child. Moreover, the individual faces the subsistence consumption constraint, below which individual can survive but is unable to reproduce.13,14

nit = 0 if cit < c̃.

(8)

Hence, an adult i in period t allocates the income yit , between consumption, cit , and fertility, nit ,
so as to maximize the utility function ui (cit , nit ).

(cit , nit ) = argmax ui (cit , nit )
s.t. cit + ρyit nit = yit ;
(9)
nit ≥ 0; cit ≥ 0;
nit = 0 if cit < c̃.
Given the properties of the utility function, a solution to the maximization problem exists and is
unique, and given the income realization, it is time independent. In particular, if yit ∈ [0; c̃], individuals
will be able to be engaged in reproduction (i.e., nit = 0) and will therefore consume their entire yield,
yit . However, if yit ∈ [c̃, y h ] then assuming that y h ≤ c̃/[(1 − γ)(1 + ρ)], the subsistence consumption
constraints binds and individuals will consume the subsistence consumption, c̃, and hence given their
budget constraint will devote the reaming income to raise (yit − c̃)/(ρyit ) children.15

Alternatively, one can assume that if consumption is below subsistence, individuals do not survive and thus do not
reproduce. Similar structure of the relationship between subsistence consumption and fertility is used by Baudin et al.
(2015).
14
Differential subsistence levels for each production mode, based on the energy requirement associated with them,
would have no qualitative impact as long as the basic logical structure of the two production modes is maintained
(i.e., subsistence level associated with the safe mode does not exceed to the safe mode’s output (i.e., c̃s ≤ ȳ), and the
subsistence for the risky mode is between high and low realizations of risky production (i.e., yl < c̃r < yh ).)
15
As established empirically, this is a plausible assumption in the context of the Malthusian epoch.

In particular, as follows from (9), individuals who are engaged in the safe mode of production
and generate an ȳ > c̃ would find it optimal to consume the subsistence level of consumption, and as
postulated earlier, would have precisely one child. Namely, the safe yield ȳ is assumed to be such that
ȳ = c̃/(1 − ρ), permitting fertility at the replacement level (i.e., n(ȳ) = (ȳ − c̃)/(ρȳ) = 1).16
Accordingly, the fertility rate of individuals who are engaged in the risky mode of production and
obtain a favorable climatic realization that result in a level of income of y h > ȳ will be therefore above
replacement (i.e., n(y h ) = (y h − c̃)/(ρy h ) > 1).
Consumption and the fertility are therefore a function of the individual’s income (i.e., cit = c(yit )
and nit = n(yit )), and hence conditional on the income realization, the consumption and the fertility
functions are identical across individuals and time.
The indirect utility function of an adult i in period t, Vit , is therefore

vit = ui (c(yit ), n(yit )) ≡ vi (yit ).

Choice of Production Mode

Individuals chose their desirable mode of production prior to the realization of the climatic conditions.
Their choice is designed to maximize their expected utility, conditional on the expected probability
distribution of the climatic shocks, and it may differ across individuals based on their degree of loss
aversion.
As follows from (4),(5),(9), and (10),The expected utility urit , generated by adult i in period t who
choses the risky production mode, is

This normalization enhances the analytical tractability of the model and has no impact on its qualitative predictions.

(14)

Analogously, as follows from (5),(9), and (10), the utility, usit , generated by adult i in period t who
choses the safe production mode is

usit = γ ln(1 + ) ≡ us .

(15)

Hence, the utility generated by individuals who choose the safe production mode is constant across
types and time.
Assuming that the risky production mode is sufficient attractive so as to assure that at least lossneutral individuals prefers this mode of production (i.e., ur (1) > us ),17 then it follows from (14) and
(15) and the Intermediate Value Theorem that there exists a unique and time invariant level of the
parameter of loss neutrality, θ̂ ∈ (0; 1), such that ur (θ̂) = us .

(17)

Hence, the relatively more loss averse individuals in society (i.e., i ∈ I A ≡ {i ∈ I|θi ∈ (0; θ̂])
would choose the safe mode of production, whereas the least loss averse individuals in society (i.e.,
i ∈ I B ≡ {i ∈ I|θi ∈ (θ̂; 1]} would choose the risky production mode. Hence, as depicted in Figure
2, since the initial distribution of θi is uniform, the sorting of individuals into the risky and the safe
modes of production will result in an average degree of loss neutrality of θ̂/2 among individuals who
selected the safe mode of production and an average degree of loss neutrality of (1 + θ̂)/2 among
individuals who selected the risky mode of production.

(1 + θ̂)/2, among those who choose the risky mode.

Furthermore, the cut-off level θ̂ is positively affected by the magnitude of the shocks ∆, (i.e.,
θ̂0 (∆) > 0).18 Namely, since the risky mode of production is less profitable in a more volatile environment, the level of risk-neutrality that would make individual indifferent between the two modes of
production will be higher in a more volatile environment.
0

Hence, as depicted in Figure 3, if the degree of climatic volatility increases from ∆ to ∆ , the
critical level of θ will increase from θ̂ to θˆ0 and the average degree of loss neutrality will increase
among the two groups: from θ̂/2 to θˆ0 /2 among individuals who choose the safe mode of production,
and from (1 + θ̂)/2 to (1 + θˆ0 )/2 among individuals who choose the risky mode of production.
18
Note that the effect of climatic volatility ∆ on the cut-off level of loss neutrality θ̂ is orthogonal to the degree of
spatial correlation in these shocks, µ, and therefore the idiosyncratic and aggregate component of climatic volatility have
an independent effect on long-run level of loss-aversion in population.

The Evolution of the Composition of Loss Aversion

The evolution of the composition of loss aversion is governed by the effect of loss aversion on the
differential reproductive success across individual. Since loss aversion is assumed to be transmitted
intergenerationally within each dynasty i without any alteration, if a greater propensity towards loss
aversion is associated with higher income, and thus higher reproductive success, then loss aversion will
become more prevalent in the population in the long-run.
As established in (16), the threshold level of the parameter of loss aversion, θ̂, below which individuals are engaged in the safe production mode is constant and is time invariant. Moreover, as
established in (31), individuals whose θi ≤ θ̂ (i.e., members of group A) have identical fertility rate
(i.e., nit = 1 if θi ≤ θ̂), while the fertility rates of individuals whose θi > θ̂, (i.e., members of group
B) is identically distributed based upon the expression in I (20) and (21). Hence, the distribution of
loss aversion within each of the two groups has no effect on the aggregate fertility within each of the
groups.
Nevertheless, differential fertility rates across the two groups affect the relative sizes of the two
groups, their representation of in the population, and thus the evolution of distribution of loss aversion
in the population as a whole.
The total population in the economy in period t. Nt is decomposed into members of group A, NtA ,

17

and member of group B, NtA , i.e.,

NtA + NtB = Nt .

(22)

Hence, since that the initial distribution of types i is uniform over the entire feasible domain of θi ,
(i.e., since θi ∼ U (0, 1]), it follows that
N0A = θ̂N0 ;
N0B

(23)

= (1 − θ̂)N0 .

Moreover, since this distribution remains intact over time due to the stationarity of θ̂, the evolution
of the size population of group A from period t − 1 to period t, is governed by the difference equation

therefore by the asymptotic rate of population growth, nj , of each of group. Since Ntj = (nj )t N0j , if

(panel b). Moreover, since reproduction success within this group is independent of the degree of
loss-aversion, the average level of loss-neutrality in this group is not changing over time, remaining
constant at its initial level, (1 + θ̂)/2, and thus the asymptotic average level of loss-neutrality in
the population, θ̄, is just the average loss-neutrality among individuals who choose the risky mode
production, (1 + θ̂)/2.

Moreover, as depicted in Figure 3, if the degree of climatic volatility increases from ∆ to ∆ , the
critical level of θ will increase from θ̂ to θˆ0 and the average degree of loss neutrality will increase among
the two groups: from θ̂/2 to θˆ0 /2 among individuals who choose the safe mode of production, and from
(1 + θ̂)/2 to (1 + θˆ0 )/2 among individuals who choose the risky mode of production. Hence, regardless
of the degree of correlation in the shocks, volatility will increase the degree of loss-neutrality in the
long-run. In particular, as depicted in Figure 6 (a) if the the degree of correlation in the shocks is
relatively small (i.e., µ < µ̂), the dominating type in the long-run are individuals who are engaged
in the risky mode of production and volatility will increase the average degree of loss-neutrality from
from (1 + θ̂)/2 to (1 + θˆ0 )/2 (panel a), whereas if the the degree of correlation in the shocks is relatively
large (i.e., µ > µ̂), the dominating type in the long-run are individuals who are engaged in the safe
mode of production, and yet again, volatility will increase the average degree of loss-neutrality from
θ̂/2 to θˆ0 /2 (panel b).

Testable Implications

In order to derive the testable implication of the theoretical model, suppose that each geographical
region, r, is populated by a continuum of groups of individuals. Suppose further that the spatial auto
correlations in climatic shocks differ across these groups and their geographical locations and is char22

acterized by a non-trivial distribution µr with cumulative distribution function Fµr (µ). In particular,
an increase in µ by dµ corresponds to the uniform shift of the entire distribution to the right, resulting
in a new distribution µ0r ≡ µr + dµ with a cumulative distribution function Fµ0r (µ) = Fµr (µ − dµ).
The average θ̄ in the region r is therefore

(39)

where as follows from the fact that Fµr (µ) is non-decreasing, ∂ θ̄r /∂dµ ≤ 0.
Hence, as follows from (38), (39), the testable predictions of the model are:
Proposition 2.1. If the economy is characterized by:
(i) a higher spatial correlation of climatic shocks, µ, the average level of loss aversion that will be
observed in the economy in the long run, [1/θ̄], will be higher.
(ii) a higher volatility of climatic shocks, ∆, the average level of loss aversion that will be observed in
the economy in the long run, [1/θ̄], will be lower.
Thus, the theory suggests that individuals and societies that are originated in regions of the world
in which climatic shocks tended to be spatially correlated, and thus aggregate in nature, would be
characterized by greater intensity of loss aversion, while descendants of regions that were characterized
by idiosyncratic climatic shocks will tend to be more loss-neutral and to assign more symmetric weights
23

θi

to gains and loses.

2.6

Interpretations of the Predictions of the Model

Consider a continuum of individuals that are positioned on the edge of an evolutionary cliff (i.e., a
subsistence consumption constraint). Suppose that these individuals span that entire spectrum of loss
aversion – from loss-neutrality to an infinite level of loss-aversion. Individuals who are sufficiently
loss-averse, would choose the safe mode of production in order to avert the likelihood of dropping from
the evolutionary cliff and the subsequent extinction of their dynasty. Their choice of the safe mode
of production would assure each of these individuals the subsistence level of consumption as well as
one surviving offspring. Hence each of these dynasties would survive indefinitely although the size of
group as a whole remain constant over time.
In contrast, a continuum of (sufficiently) loss-neutral individuals, who are less concern about
dropping from the evolutionary cliff, and the subsequent extinction of their dynasty, would choose the
risky mode of production. As long as those individuals would experience independent (idiosyncratic)
climatic shocks, while a fraction 1-P of the group would become extinct in the initial period, with
probability one, a portion of the remaining fraction would experience a sufficiently long sequence
of mostly positive realizations that would permit each individual in the group to have more than
one surviving, and the asymptotic growth of their dynasty. Hence, the surviving dynasties among
these initial group of relatively loss-neutral individuals will increase in size over time, and in light
of lower (i.e., zero) growth rate of the loss-averse group, will dominate the population in the longrun. Nevertheless, if the individuals would experience highly correlated shocks, the likelihood of a
sufficiently long sequence of realization is negligible and the dynasties of those relatively loss-neutral
individuals would drop from the evolutionary cliff and would become extinct in the long-run.
Thus, as long as the climatic shocks are predominantly idiosyncratic, while the prudent strategy
of the safe mode of production would assure the survival of the dynasty and may appear optimal
from an individual viewpoint, nature will ultimately select the relatively loss-neutral individuals –
A significant fraction of the loss-neutral individuals would become extinct in the short run, but the
surviving fraction would experience higher reproductive success and would dominate the population
in the long-run.

2.7

Absence of Evolutionary Process if the Subsistence Constraint is not Binding

This subsection establishes that the presence of a reference point associated with a subsistence consumption constraint is an essential feature for the evolution of loss aversion in the process of development.
If the subsistence consumption constraint is absent, or the level of income per capita in the economy
is large enough such that the constraint does not binding (e.g., y ≥ c̃/[(1 − γ)(1 + ρ)]), the optimal
level of consumption and fertility will be

cit = (1 − γ)yit ≡ c(yit )
(40)
nit = γ/ρ ≡ n(yit )
In particular, the fraction of time dedicated to childrearing is a constant, γ, independent of the
level of income, whereas a fraction 1 − γ of income is devoted to consumption. Hence, while variation
in income driven by the differential choices of the production modes would affect consumption, they
would have no effect on fertility and thus on reproductive success. The composition of loss aversion
will therefore remain intact overtime.

Empirical Strategy and Data

This section presents the empirical strategy developed to analyze the effect of the idiosyncratic and
aggregate components of temperature shocks on contemporary variations in the rate of loss aversion.
Moreover, it describes the global measures of temperature intertemporal volatility and spatial correlation that are designed to capture the idiosyncratic and aggregate components of temperature shocks,
as well as a range of proxies for loss aversion, at the individual and ethnic group level.

3.1

Identification Strategy

The empirical analysis surmounts significant hurdles in the identification of the causal effect of climatic
conditions of the evolution of loss aversion. In particular, the research adopts an empirical strategy
that is designed to mitigate concerns about the potential role of reverse causality, as well as omitted
variables, in the observed association between climatic characteristics and loss aversion.
First, since unlike soil characteristics, climatic characteristics are largely orthogonal to individuals’

25

preferences and thus choices, the focus on climatic (rather than soil) characteristics assures that the
association between climatic characteristics and loss aversion is not driven by reversed causality in the
identification. In particular, historical temperature patterns, for the most part, are determined by the
regional geographical conditions and are orthogonal to human interventions.
Second, potential concerns about the role of omitted geographical, institutional, cultural, and human characteristics in the observed association between intertemporal climatic volatility and climatic
spatial correlation and loss aversion are mitigated by accounting for a large set of confounding characteristics that might have determined loss aversion and are correlated with temperature volatility
and temperature spatial correlation. In particular the analysis accounts for: potentially confounding
effects of: geographical characteristics (e.g., absolute latitude, mean elevation, the level and diversity of the stability of land for agriculture, distance to coast or navigable river, percentage of land
in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones, level of precipitation, and landlocked societies), as
well as the time elapsed since of the neolithic revolution; (ii) regional fixed effects, capturing unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity at the regional level; (iii) host country fixed effects, and thus
time-invariant country-of-birth specific factors, (e.g., geography, institutions, history, and culture);
for second-generation migrants; (iv) individual characteristics (e.g., age, gender, number of siblings,
religion, education level and income); (v) ethnographic characteristics (e.g., intensity of agriculture
and animal husbandry, settlement structure and plow use) characteristics.
Third, the adoption of the epidemiological approach and the exploration of the determinants loss
aversion among second-generation migrants, permits the analysis to overcome two major concerns:
(i) it distinguishes between the effect of temperature volatility and spatial correlation in the parental
country of origin (rather than those in country of residence) on loss aversion, capturing the culturallyembodied, intergenerationally-transmitted component of the effect of geography, rather than the direct
effect of geography; (ii) it accounts for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity in the host country
(e.g., geographical, cultural and institutional characteristics), and thus mitigating possible concerns
about the confounding effect of host country-specific characteristics.
Fourth, the natural experiment associated with the Columbian Exchange introduces the opportunity to exploit differential assignment of crops to indigenous populations across the globe and resulting
exogenous variation in the degree of crop-specific effective volatility, which makes it possible to shed
light on the contribution of the forces of cultural evolution to the origins of loss aversion, as opposed

26

to the sorting of more loss averse individuals into the less climatically volatile environments, mitigate
concerns about the confounding effects of unobservables geographical factors in the parental county of
origin and demonstrates the importance of evolutionary processes in the pre-1500 and the post-1500
period.
Finally, the analysis explores variation in the rate of loss aversion across ethnic groups, and thus
captures the evolution of loss aversion in the precolonial era, establishes that some of the hypothesized
evolutionary process was completed in the past.

3.2

Dependent Variable: Proxies for Loss Aversion

Adequately capturing variation in the rate of loss aversion in itself poses a significant challenge due to
the absence of well-established convention over its proxies in the corresponding literature. To overcome
this problem novel measures of loss aversion at an individual and ethnic group levels, are introduced.
Variations in the prevalence and the distribution of loss-aversion across individuals is captured
by a variety of newly introduced measures of the intensity of loss aversion. Exploiting the ESS,
GSS and the WVS, the degree of loss aversion is captured by individual’s ranking of potential job
characteristics. In particular, preference for job security over other characteristics such as salary and
promotion opportunities are used as a proxy for loss-aversion. Importantly, since conceivably a layoff
is typically only a transitory phenomenon, preferences for job security over higher salary does not
simply represents the trade-off between potential gains and loss of income, and thus risk aversion, but
rather the reluctance of individuals to lose something that is in their possession, and thus loss aversion.
Alternatively, If one views a job as a ‘gamble’ with ‘being employed’ as a reference point, the state
‘being fired’ would then represent a down-side of this gamble. From this point of view, preference for
job security over other characteristics or over salary would capture individual’s rate of loss aversion,
as it represents ones reluctance towards getting the down-side or ‘loosing’ the gamble.
The global distribution of the proxy for loss aversion based on the WVS is depicted in Figure 7,
reflecting a lower degree of loss aversion in most countries in the upper part of Northern hemisphere
as well as among the decedents of these regions in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In
contrast, higher degree of loss aversion can be detected in Southern Europe and the decedents of these
regions in Latin America, as well as in Africa and South Asia.
Proxies for the rate of loss aversion at an ethnic group level are constructed using several ethno-

27

Figure 7: The Global Distribution of Loss Aversion as captured by the WVS
graphic characteristics, which supposedly capture revealed preference for cautiousness and are associated with loss averse behavior. Differences in the prevalence and the distribution of loss-aversion
across ethnic groups are captured by two ethnographic characteristics reported by the EA and the
SCCS. In particular, loss aversion is captured by parental preferences for sleeping in closed proximity
to their infants; an overly cautious behavior driven by the fear of losing a child during his sleep,
despite the low probability that is associated with this event. Alternatively, loss aversion is captured
by the prevailing types of games played by members of an ethnic group. In particular, loss-aversion
among members of the ethnic group, is captured by the prevalence of games that are predominantly
strategy-based, rather than those governed by chance. The presence of a chance as the major element
in games is associated with a lower rate of cautiousness and thus loss neutral population, while strategy
based games would be more common among groups with more cautions and loss averse population.
In addition, the degree of diversification across productive activities is used to capture manifestation
of loss aversion in human behavior. Prevalence of high diversification of activities, as a strategy of
mitigating affects of adverse shocks, is a a consequence of higher degree of loss aversion among the

28

members of ethnic group. Alternatively, loss aversion could postulate itself through the choice of a
major crop for cultivation. In particular, the choice of roots or tubers, as opposed to cereals, would be
an indicator of a higher degree of loss aversion on an ethnic level, due to the greater relative resistance
of roots and tubers to the adverse effects of climatic shocks.

3.3

Independent Variable: Idiosyncratic and Aggregate Climatic Uncertainty

This section describes the measures the will be used to capture the impact of the idiosyncratic and
aggregate components of climatic shocks on loss aversion. In light of the predictions of the theory, the
prevalence of loss aversion is linked to intertemporal climatic volatility as well as special correlation in
climatic conditions. A-priori one could have captured these climatic characteristics using either temperature or precipitation. However, as established in Table A1, while productivity in the Malthusian
era is significantly correlated with various characteristics of temperature, it is orthogonal to the corresponding measures of precipitation. Thus the proposed hypothesis is examined based on the impact
of measures of intertemporal temperature volatility, as well as spatial correlation in temperature on
the intensity of loss aversion.
As noted in the empirical strategy section, measures of intertemporal temperature volatility and
temperature spatial correlation capture the distinction between the aggregate and the idiosyncratic
nature of the shocks. Indeed, stronger temperature spatial correlation reflects a higher likelihood that
neighboring regions would obtain similar realizations of temperature shock , capturing the aggregate
nature of the shocks. Similarly, keeping the temperature spatial correlation constant, the level of
temperature volatility corresponds to the variability of temperature shocks at a local level, capturing
the idiosyncratic component of the shock.
Hence, following the methodology of Durante (2009), these measures are constructed based on
the monthly temperatures over the period 1900-2000, using the 0.5◦ × 0.5◦ resolution of the Climatic
Research Unit (CRU).19 In particular, intertemporal temperature volatility over the period 19002000 is the average volatility in each month over this 100 year period, where the monthly volatility
is captured the variance in monthly temperature over this 100 year period. Similarly, temperature
spatial correlation is the correlation between the sequences of 1200 monthly temperature in a given
19
Potential concerns about changes in climate over the course of human history that is relevant for the evolution of
loss aversion, appears are largely misplaced. As reported in Table A10, climatic volatility and spatial correlation over
the past 100 year period are highly correlated with the corresponding climatic characteristics in the past 1500 years.

29

cell over the year 1900-2000, and the average of those sequences in its eight neighboring cells. Each of
these measures is first calculated at the grid cell level and then aggregated at the country and ethnic
group levels.
The global distribution of these two climatic measures is depicted in Figures 8 and 9. The figure
suggests that higher intertemporal temperature volatility is observed in the upper part of the Northern
hemisphere and a lower one closer to the equator. Indeed, in line with the proposed theory of a negative
effect of climatic volatility on loss aversion, accounting for the post-1500 migration to the new world
as well as to Australia and New Zealand, individuals originated from the most volatile regions of
the world tend to be less loss averse (as depicted in Figure 7). Furthermore, consistent with the
proposed theory of a positive effect of temperature spatial correlation on loss aversion, indeed higher
intertemporal temperature volatility tends to be lower in the upper part of the northern hemisphere
where loss aversion is lower, and lower in proximity to the equator where loss aversion is higher.

Figure 8: The Global Distribution of Intertemporal Temperature Volatility
An alternative measure of temperature intertemporal volatility is employed in the analysis to
capture the effect of historical climatic shocks on the evolution of loss aversion. The measure of
historical temperature volatility is calculated using the paleoclimatic data reconstructed in Mann

30

Figure 9: The Global Distribution of Temperature Spatial Correlation
et al. (2009) on a 5◦ × 5◦ resolution for a 1500-year period spanning from 500 to 2000. The measure
is constructed as volatility of annual temperature anomalies for each grid cell over the whole available
period, as well as for historical subsample of years between 500 and 1000. The measure is aggregated
from a grid-level to a level of country.
To exploit the implications of the natural experiment associated with the Columbian Exchange
for the evolution of loss aversion a novel measure of an effective potential volatility is introduced. In
particular, for each type of crop, effective temperature volatility is calculated as an average of monthly
volatilities across four month prior to the beginning of crop-specific growth cycle – volatility during
the period when food scarcity is at its peak and climatic shocks may be particularly detrimental to the
effectiveness of storage of crops, productivity of the upcoming harvest and the hunting and gathering
of supplementary food sources. In addition, for each of the 0.5◦ × 0.5◦ grid cells corresponding to CRU
dataset the potential yield maximizing crop is identified for a period prior to 1500 (e.g., crops native
to the region) and for the period following the Columbian Exchange (e.g., any crop of the world) in a
manner similar to Galor and Özak (2016). Effective potential volatility prior and after the Columbian
Exchange is then identified as an effective crop-specific volatility for these crops. Hence, the change

31

in the degree of effective potential volatility due to the Columbian Exchange would be observed in a
case when a potentially superior crop was introduced to a particular grid cell and a growth cycle of
the new crop was different from the one corresponding to a previously yield-maximizing crop. The
variation in the change of effective potential volatility is ultimately used to identify the effect of a
“random assignment” of effective potential volatility on the evolution of loss aversion.
As elaborated above, an alternative climatic dimension that could have been used to capture the
idiosyncratic and the aggregate components of climatic shocks is precipitation. However, shocks to
precipitation, unlike shocks to temperature appears orthogonal to productivity in the pre-industrial
era and are therefore tangential to the evolution of loss aversion. In particular, as established in Table
1, a cross-country analysis suggests that neither the mean level of precipitation nor precipitation
volatility have a statistically significant association with population density and urbanization level
in the year 1500, and thus in light of the Malthusian paradigm (Ashraf and Galor, 2011), have no
significant association with the level of technology and productivity in the year 1500. In contrast, the
level of temperature volatility has a strong statistically and economically significant effect on both
measures. Moreover, the qualitative results remains intact, if one accounts for the confounding effects
of additional geographical characteristics (e.g., absolute latitude, mean elevation, percentage of arable
land, mean land suitability, island and landlocked dummy, and distance to coast or river), the timing
of the neolithic revolution, and regional fixed effects. These results may reflect that view that while the
adverse effect of precipitation shocks can be potentially mitigated by irrigation and drainage systems,
the the adverse effects of temperature shock are harder to be mitigated by human intervention.

Empirical Analysis: Second Generation Migrants

This section analyzes the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation on the second-generation migrants’ preferences of job security versus salary and other characteristics in Europe and the United States. In particular, it analyses the effect of temperature volatility
and correlation on preferences of jobs security versus salary as reported in the European Social Survey (ESS), and on preferences of jobs security versus salary and other characteristics (short working
hours, promotion opportunities and job satisfaction) as reported in the General Social Survey (GSS).
The analysis of second-generation migrants accounts for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity in
the host country (e.g., geographical and institutional characteristics). Moreover, since temperature

Determinants of Loss Aversion among Second Generation Migrants in Europe

This subsection analyzes the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial
correlation on the second-generation migrants’ preferences of job security versus salary in Europe, in
light of the conjectured positive association between loss aversion and preference for job security over
salary. The effect of temperature volatility and correlation on preferences of job security versus salary
is estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS) using the empirical model (41).
Table 2 establishes the negative statistically and economically significant effect of temperature
volatility and positive significant effect of temperature spatial correlation on preferences of job security versus salary as suggested by the theory. The estimated effect implies that increasing temperature
volatility in the parental country of origin by one standard deviation decreases the difference between
second-generation migrant’s valuation of job security and salary between 0.16 and 0.24 units20 , while
increasing temperature spatial correlation in the parental country of origin by one standard deviation increases the difference between second-generation migrant’s valuation of job security and salary
between 0.034 and 0.059 units.
20

Each characteristic is evaluated by the scale from 1 to 5, so that their difference takes values from −4 to 4.

34

The relationship between intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation
and preferences of job security versus salary, accounting for country of birth fixed effects, and therefore
for unobserved time-invariant omitted variables at the country of birth level, are established in column
(1). The estimated effect of temperature volatility is negative and statistically significant at the 1%
level, while estimated effect of temperature spatial correlation is positive and statistically significant
at the 10% level, implying economically significant effects suggested by the theory.

Notes: Using OLS regressions, this table establishes that the preferred job characteristics of second generation migrants
reflect loss aversion. In particular, their valuation of job security vs. salary is negatively affected by temperature
volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the
parental country of origin. Additional geographical controls are gini index of land suitability , distance to coast or
river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level.
Individual controls include age, gender, number of siblings, religion, education level, and income. Sample excludes
small island countries. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting their mean and dividing by
their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard deviation in the
independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the parental country of origin
level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the
10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.

Column (2) accounts for some of the other confounding geographical characteristics of the country
of origins. In particular, absolute latitude and mean elevation. Accounting for the effects of geog-

35

raphy and country of birth heterogeneity strengthens estimated effects of temperature volatility and
spatial correlation on preferences of job security versus salary both in terms of absolute values and
significances. In particular, estimated effect of temperature spatial correlation becomes statistically
significant at the 5% level. Column (3) accounts for the whole set of confounding geographical characteristics of the country of origins, which, apart from absolute latitude and mean elevation, includes
mean level and the gini index of land suitability, distance to coast or navigable river, landlocked
dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level.
Reassuringly, coefficient on temperature volatility remains statistically significant at the 1% level,
while coefficient on temperature spatial correlation becomes statistically significant at the 1% level as
well. The effects of other confounding geographical characteristics are less significant than the effects
of temperature volatility and correlation. In particular, most geographical characteristics have no
significant effect on preferences of job security versus salary.
Column (4) considers the confounding effect of the advent of sedentary agriculture, as captured
by the years elapsed since the onset of the Neolithic Revolution, on the evolution of the loss aversion.
The effects of temperature volatility and spatial correlation remain statistically significant at the 1%
level. Additionally, the effect of the timing of transition to the Neolithic has no significant effect on
preferences of job security versus salary.
Columns (5) and (6) sequentially account for the survey round fixed effects and second-generation
migrant’s individual characteristics (i.e., age, gender, number of siblings, religion, education level, and
income). The estimated effects of temperature volatility and spatial correlation on preferences of job
security versus salary continue to be statistically significant at the 1% level. It should be noted that
the coefficients on temperature volatility and spatial correlation are remarkably stable in terms of
absolute values across all specifications, especially in columns (2) – (6).

4.1.1

Loss Aversion vs. Risk Aversion

This subsection establishes that intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation are not associated with the attitude toward risk aversion. Furthermore, While risk seeking, as
one would expect is associated with a reduced preference for job security, accounting for risk aversion has no impact on the effect of climatic on loss aversion. Hence, the observed effects of climatic
characteristics on loss aversion operate directly, rather than through their influence on risk aversion.

Notes: Using OLS regressions, columns (1) through (6) of the table establish that second generation migrants’ valuation of Adventure
and Risk Seeking is neither affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk), nor by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate
uncertainty) in the parental country of origin. Columns (7) and (8) establish that second generation migrants’ valuation of job
security vs. salary is negatively affected by the degree of risk seeking and is still negatively affected by temperature volatility
(idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the parental country of
origin.. Additional geographical controls are the gini index of land suitability, distance to coast or river, landlocked dummy,
percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include age, gender,
number of siblings, religion, education level, and income. Sample excludes small island countries. All independent variables have
been normalized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and
show the effect of a one standard deviation in the independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered
at the parental country of origin level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5%
level, and * at the 10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.

As established in columns (1) – (6) of Table 3, individuals’ preference for adventure and risk
seeking are not significantly associated with intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature
spatial correlation.21 Moreover, as demonstrated in columns (7) and (8), the effect of intertemporal
temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation on the preference of second generation

Individuals attitude towards risk is captured by the response to the question: “Now I will briefly describe some
people. Please listen to each description and tell me how much each person is or is not like you. Use this card for your
answer. She/he looks for adventures and likes to take risks. She/he wants to have an exciting life.”

migrants in Europe for job security over salary, as estimated in Table 2, is unaffected by the highly
significant positive association between the rates of risk aversion and the rate of loss aversion, lending
credence to the hypothesis of that geographical origins of loss aversion are distinct from those of risk
aversion.

Determinants of Loss Aversion among Second Generation Migrants in the US

This subsection examines the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial
correlation on the second-generation migrants’ preferences of job security versus salary and other
job characteristics in the US, in light of the conjectured positive association between loss aversion
and preference for job security over salary and other characteristics (short working hours, promotion
opportunities and job satisfaction). The effect of temperature volatility and correlation on preferences
of job security versus salary and other job characteristics is estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS)
using the model analogous to model (41).
Table 4 establishes a negative statistically and economically significant effect of temperature volatility and positive significant effect of temperature spatial correlation on second-generation migrants’
preferences of job security versus salary and other characteristics. In particular, Columns (1) through
(5) establish the effect of temperature volatility and spatial correlation on preferences for job security over all other characteristics22 , sequentially accounting for the confounding effects of unobserved
time-invariant omitted variables at the region of birth level, other geographical characteristics (mean
temperature, absolute latitude, mean elevation, mean level and the gini index of land suitability, distance to coast or river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate
zones and precipitation level), the advent of sedentary agriculture, as captured by the years elapsed
since the onset of the Neolithic Revolution, survey wave fixed effects and individual characteristics
of second generation migrant (age, gender, number of siblings, religion, education level, and income).
The estimated effects imply that increasing temperature volatility in the parental country of origin by
one standard deviation decreases the probability of job security having a higher ranking between 18
and 42 percentage points, while increasing temperature spatial correlation by one standard deviation
increases the probability of job security having a higher ranking between 13 and 17 percentage points.
22
The preferences for job security versus other characteristics are measured as the rank assigned to the job security
by the second-generation migrant based on the answers to the questions “. . . which one thing on this list (security, salary,
short working hours, promotion opportunities and job satisfaction) you would most/second most/. . . prefer in a job?”

Notes: Using OLS regression, this table establishes that the preferred job characteristics of second generation migrants reflect loss
aversion. In particular, their valuation of job security vs other characteristics (salary, short working hours, promotion opportunities
and job satisfaction) and of job security vs. salary is negatively affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively
affected by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the parental country of origin. Additional geographical
controls are the gini index of land suitability , distance to coast or river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical,
subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include age, gender, number of siblings, religion,
education level, and income. Sample excludes small island countries. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting
their mean and dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard
deviation in the independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the parental country of origin
level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all
for two-sided hypothesis tests.

It should be noted that coefficients on the temperature volatility and spatial correlation are rather
stable across specifications and statistically significant at the 1% level in two final specifications.
Columns (6) and (7) replicate columns (4) and (5) with preference for job security over salary23
being the explained variable. Estimated effects of temperature volatility and spatial correlation are
statistically significant at the 1% level and imply that increasing intertemporal temperature volatility
in the parental country of origin by one standard deviation decreases the difference in ranks of job
23

Preferences of job security versus salary are measured as the difference between the rankings of the two characteristics, ranging from -4 to 4.

39

security and salary between 0.52 and 0.62 units, while increasing temperature spatial correlation by one
standard deviation increases the difference in ranks of job security and salary between 0.24 and 0.28
units. Reassuringly, confounding geographical characteristics of parental country of origin are less
significant than the effects of temperature volatility and spatial correlation across all specifications
and explained variables. In particular, most geographical characteristics have no significant effect on
preferences of job security versus salary.

Robustness
Alternative Estimation Method: Ordered Probit

The results are robust to the use of an alternative estimation method, rather than OLS. In particular,
using Ordered Probit, one can estimates the probability of observing each rank of preference for
Job Security, conditional on intertemporal temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) as well as on
temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty). In line with the OLS estimates, as established
in Tables C.1 and C.2, and as interpreted and further discussed in Appendix A, larger temperature
spatial correlation increases significantly the probability that second generation migrants in Europe,
as well as in the US, will be more loss averse, whereas greater intertemporal temperature volatility
decreases the probability that a second generation migrants in Europe and the US will be loss averse.

4.3.2

Selection on Unobservables

This subsection examines the likelihood that omitted variables could alter the qualitative findings.
Table C.4 establishes that it is very improbable that omitted variables could have affected the qualitative results presented in Tables 2 and 4. In particular, as established in columns (2) and (4), (using
columns (1) and (3) as the baseline specifications), the estimated value of the coefficient on intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation, if unobservables where as correlated
as the observables (i.e., Oster’s β ∗ statistic), are very close to the estimated OLS coefficients. Furthermore, since zero does not belong to the interval created by the estimated value on and Oster’s β ∗ ,
one can reject the hypothesis that the value of the coefficient is driven exclusively by unobservables.
In addition, the indexes AET (Altonji et al., 2005; Bellows and Miguel, 2009) and δ (Oster, 2014)
measure how strongly correlated unobservables would have to be in order to account for the full size of
the coefficient on temperature volatility and spatial correlation (v and c subscripts correspondingly),

40

are mostly different from the critical value of 1.

Notes: Using OLS regression, this table establishes that second generation migrants valuation of job characteristics
that are orthogonal to loss aversion (i.e., short working hours in column 1, job satisfaction in 2, promotion
opportunities in 3, training opportunities vs ability to use own initiative in 4, training opportunities vs salary
in 5 and salary vs ability to use own initiative in 6) is neither affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic
risk), nor by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the parental country of origin. Additional
geographical controls are the gini index of land suitability, distance to coast or river, landlocked dummy, percentage
of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include age,

Placebo Tests

This section performs a series of placebo tests, analyzing the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation on the second-generation migrants’ valuation of job characteristics that are orthogonal to the loss aversion. Table 5 establishes that preferences of second-generation
migrants in the US for short working hours (Column 1), feeling of importance and accomplishment in
41

a job (Column 2), and promotion opportunities (Column 3) are mostly unaffected by the intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation in the parental country of origin.24 In
addition, the table indicates that the comparative valuations of second-generation migrants in Europe
to training opportunities vs ability to use own initiative in a job (Column 4), training opportunities
vs salary (Column 5), and salary vs ability to use own initiative (Column 6) are orthogonal to the
intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation in the parental country of
origin.

Orthogonality of the Climatic Variables to Other Cultural Dimensions

This subsection establishes that the effects of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature
spatial correlation on Loss Aversion does not capture their effects on a wide range of other cultural
characteristics.
In particular, as established in Tables 6 and 7, intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation in the parental country of origin do not affect long term orientation,
obedience, altruism, and attitudes towards equality, gender roles, government and tradition among
43

second-generation migrants in Europe and the US.
In addition, Table 8 establishes that even though there is a certain degree of statistically significant
association between preference for job security over salary and some of the cultural dimensions (e.g.,
obedience, altruism, equality and preference for strong government) among second generation migrants
in Europe, the baseline results are not altered, when accounting for these effects.25

Notes: Using OLS regression, this table establishes that second generation migrants preference for job security other salary is
positively and statistically associated with some of the other preference (i.e., obedience, altruism, attitude towards equality and
preference for strong government) but is orthogonal to others (i.e., attitudes towards gender roles and tradition). In any of the
cases the effect of temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the
parental country of origin on the valuation of job security other salary is significantly affected. Additional geographical controls
are the gini index of land suitability, distance to coast or river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical
and temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include age, gender, number of siblings, religion, education level,
and income. Sample excludes small island countries. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting their mean
and dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard deviation

25
Similar analysis is not possible for the US sample of second generation migrants, due to the small number of
respondents for which both the job security preference and other cultural dimensions are observed.

Natural Experiment: The Columbian Exchange

This section addresses a potential concern that the established result might be driven by the sorting
of loss averse individuals into the less climatically volatile environments, as opposed to the proposed
mechanism of cultural evolution. In order to overcome this hurdle, the natural experiment of the
Columbian exchange and corresponding exogenous variation in the change of effective crop-specific
temperature volatility are exploited. In particular, the analysis focuses on the measure of climatic
volatility that captures temperature variation before the beginning of the growth cycle of the crop
that maximizes potential yield prior to the year 1500, and explores the effect of the change in this
measure of effective volatility due to the potential change of the yield maximizing crop in the course
of the Columbian Exchange.
Columns (2), (5) and (8) of Table 9 establish that the degree of loss aversion of second generation
migrants in Europe and the US, as captured by their preference for job security, is negatively and
significantly affected by the level of effective potential volatility of temperature prior to year 1500, as
well as its change due to the Columbian Exchange. Reassuringly the positive effect of temperature
spatial correlation on the preference for job security stays qualitatively and quantitatively unaltered,
compared to the corresponding baseline specification captured in the columns (1), (4) and (7). This
finding identifies the effect of a “random assignment” of effective potential volatility on the evolution
of loss aversion and suggests that sorting played an insignificant role in the determination of loss
aversion.
The concern over the self-selection of loss averse individuals into locations with high spatial correlation of climatic shocks is significantly less intense. For instance, as opposed to volatility, correlation
of temperature across space is non transparent to a casual observer. In addition, ceteris paribus, individual’s wellbeing is unaffected by the correlation of climatic shocks across different locations. Nether
the less, similar empirical exercise can be performed with respect to the effective spatial correlation of
temperature and its change in the course of the Columbian exchange. As established, in columns (3),
(6) and (9) of Table 9, preference for loss aversion of second generation migrants is indeed positively
and significantly affected by the effective temperature spatial correlation prior to the year 1500, which
goes in line with the previous results and theoretical predictions. The change in the level of the effective temperature spatial correlation, however, has no statistically significant impact on the preference
for loss aversion. Such result could be a consequence of the lack of variation in the magnitudes of

In addition, the natural experiment associated with the Columbian Exchange, and the differential
assignment of superior crops to different regions of the world, mitigates potential concerns about
omitted variables. In particular, this natural experiment is based on the identifying assumption that,
conditional on the pre-1500 distribution of effective potential volatility, the change in effective potential
volatility resulting from the introduction of new crops is distributed randomly, independently of any
other attributes of the grid. This lends further credit to the results established in section 4.3.2.

4.3.6

Historical Temperature Volatility

This subsection examines the effect of the historical temperature volatility on the second-generation
migrants’ level of loss aversion, as captured by their preference for job security. As established in
Table 10, second generation migrant’s valuation of job security, while being positively associated with
temperature spatial correlation as before, is negatively affected by the inter-temporal temperature
volatility calculated for longer time horizon. In particular, columns (1) through (3) document that
the degree of loss aversion of second generation migrants in the US is negatively affected by the
intertemporal temperature volatility between the years 500 CE and 2000 CE. In addition, columns
(4) through (6) establish negative and significant association between second-generation migrant’s
preference for job security and measure of idiosyncratic climatic volatility, which captures variation in

47

temperature in the past, between the years 500 CE and 1000 CE.

4.3.7

Robustness to the Density of Weather Stations

In light of the potential association between the density of weather stations and measurements of
temperature spatial correlation in a given region, one may be concerned about the possibility that
climatic conditions affected the loss aversion via non-evolutionary channels. In particular, variation
in temperature spatial correlation can be partially driven by the differences in the density of the
weather measuring stations, which, in turn, is affected by the contemporary economic and institutional
characteristics of a country, which may have direct effect on the observed rate of loss aversion.
To address this problem base-line results are replicated taking into account the potential confounding effect of the weather measuring stations’ density. In particular, columns (1) and (2) of Table C.6
replicate columns (5) and (6) of Table 2, while controlling for the density of the weather stations,
used to measure the climatic data at hand. Columns (3)-(6) replicate the same exercise for columns
(4)-(7) of Table 4. It is established that the observed level of loss aversion among second generation
migrants in Europe and the US is not directly affected by the density of weather measuring stations,
while the effect of temperature volatility and spatial correlation remains statistically significant and
quantitatively similar to the base-line results.

4.3.8

Insignificant Role of Preindustrial Development

In light of the adverse effect of climatic volatility on pre-industrial development, as capture by urbanization and population density in the year 1500 (Table 1), one may be concerned about the possibility
that climatic conditions affected the loss aversion via non-evolutionary channels. In particular, preindustrial development and its potential effect on contemporary economic, institutional and cultural
characteristics may have directly affected the observed rate loss aversion rather than via the proposed
evolutionary channel.
The chosen empirical framework, however, mitigates these concerns since the analysis is based on:
(i) individual level data, accounting in particular, for income and education, and (ii) second generation
migrant that are arguably operating within the same institutional and cultural environment. Moreover,
as reported in columns (1)-(3) of Table C.5 for the ESS, and (4)-(6) for the GSS, the effect of the
climatic variables on loss aversion is orthogonal to the potentially confounding effect of historical levels

48

of population density in 1500, urbanization in 1800, and GDP per capita in 1913.26

4.3.9

Insignificant Role of Outliers

This subsection examines the potential importance of outliers in the established relationship between
intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation and the emergence of loss
aversion. As depicted in Figure C.1 outliers do not governed the observed relationship in the ESS,
whereas Figures C.2 suggests that outliers, associated with individuals from the Netherlands, may
affect the observed relationship in the GSS. Nevertheless, as established in Table C.7 the results
remain qualitatively intact if individuals from the Netherlands are excluded from the sample.

Individuals Level Analysis (WVS)

This section uses the World Values Survey (WVS) to analyze the effect of intertemporal temperature
volatility and spatial correlation on individuals’ preferences for job security over other characteristics
(salary, colleagues, job satisfaction), in light of the conjectured positive association between loss aversion and preference for job security over salary and other characteristics. The effects of temperature
volatility and correlation are estimated using the linear probability model via the following empirical

The preferences of job security versus other characteristics is measured based on the answer to the question “Now

Notes: Using OLS regression, this table establishes that individuals’ valuation of job security vs other job characteristics (i.e., salary, colleagues,
job satisfaction) is negatively affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected by temperature spatial correlation
(aggregate uncertainty) in the country of birth. Additional geographical controls are the gini index of land suitability, distance to coast or
river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include
age, gender, religion, education level, and income. Sample excludes small island countries. All independent variables have been normalized by
subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard
deviation in the independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust clustered standard error estimates are reported in parentheses; clustering at
the region of interview and individual characteristics level; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the
10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.

Table 11 establishes a negative statistically and economically significant effect of temperature
volatility and positive significant effect of temperature spatial correlation on individuals’ preferences

50

of job security versus other characteristics. The result is robust to the inclusion of world bank regional
fixed effects (column 1), geographical controls (columns 2 and 3), wave fixed effects (column 4), the
number of years since transition to agriculture (column 5) and individual characteristics (column 6).
The estimated effects suggest that increasing intertemporal temperature volatility by one standard
deviation decreases the probability of preferring job security to other characteristics by between 6.3
and 3.1 percentage points, while one standard-deviation increase in temperature spatial correlation
increases this probability by between 1.3 and 2 percentage points.
Moreover, result remains qualitatively the same after accounting for the ancestral composition of
the contemporary population (column 7). In particular, both effects remain significant at the 1% level
and imply that one standard-deviation increase in temperature volatility decreases the probability
of job security being the most preferred job characteristic by 2.3 percentage points, while increasing
temperature spatial correlation by one standard deviation increases it by 1 percentage point.

5.1.1

Robustness
Alternative Estimation Method: Probit

The results are robust to the use of an alternative estimation method, rather than OLS. In particular,
using Probit, one can estimates the probability of observing preference for Job Security vs other job
characteristics, conditional on intertemporal temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) as well as on
temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty). In line with the OLS estimates, as established in Tables 11, larger temperature spatial correlation increases significantly the probability that
second generation migrants in Europe, as well as in the US, will be more loss averse, whereas greater
intertemporal temperature volatility decreases the probability that a second generation migrants in
Europe and the US will be loss averse.

5.1.2

Selection on Unobservables

This subsection examines the likelihood that omitted variables could alter the qualitative findings.
Table C.4 establishes that it is very improbable that omitted variables could have affected the qualitative results presented in Tables 2 and 4. In particular, as established in Column (6), (using Columns
(5) as the baseline specifications), the estimated value of the coefficient on intertemporal temperature
volatility and temperature spatial correlation, if unobservables where as correlated as the observables

51

(i.e., Oster’s β ∗ statistic), are very close to the estimated OLS coefficients. Furthermore, since zero
does not belong to the interval created by the estimated value on and Oster’s β ∗ , one can reject the
hypothesis that the value of the coefficient is driven exclusively by unobservables. In addition, the indexes AET (Altonji et al., 2005; Bellows and Miguel, 2009) and δ (Oster, 2014) measure how strongly
correlated unobservables would have to be in order to account for the full size of the coefficient on
temperature volatility and spatial correlation (v and c subscripts correspondingly), are mostly different
from the critical value of 1.
5.1.3

The Insignificant Role of Preindustrial Development

In light of the adverse effect of climatic volatility on pre-industrial development, as capture by urbanization and population density in the year 1500 (Table 1), one may be concerned about the possibility
that climatic conditions affected the loss aversion via non-evolutionary channels. In particular, preindustrial development and its potential effect on contemporary economic, institutional and cultural
characteristics may have directly affected the observed rate loss aversion rather than via the proposed
evolutionary channel.
The chosen empirical framework, however, mitigates these concerns since the analysis is based on
individual level data, accounting in particular, for income and education. Moreover, as reported in
columns (7)-(9) of Table C.5, the effect of the climatic variables on loss aversion is orthogonal to the
potentially confounding effect of historical levels of population density in 1500, urbanization in 1800,
and GDP per capita in 1913.28
However, the chosen empirical framework mitigates these concerns since the analysis uses individual

Determinants of Loss Aversion

This section analyzes the determinants of loss aversion across ethnic groups. Variations in the prevalence and the distribution of loss-aversion across ethnic groups are captured by a variety of newly

52

introduced measures of the intensity of loss aversion and loss averse behavior. In particular, it analyzes the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation on the
degree of cautiousness, as captured by the types of games played in the ethnic group as reported
by the Ethnographic Atlas (EA) and the sleeping proximity of parents to infant as reported by the
(SCCS). Analysis also focuses on the effect of intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature
spatial correlation on the manifestations of loss aversion in the observed behavior, reflected by the
diversification of activities across subsistence modes and the choice of crop, as documented by the EA.
The effect of climatic shocks structure on the measures of loss aversion on an ethnic group level is
estimated by an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) methodology using the following model

Preference for Cautiousness

This section establishes that, in line with the theory, the degree of cautiousness, as captured by the
types of games played in the ethnic group and the sleeping proximity of parents to infant is negatively
and significantly affected by the degree of intertemporal temperature volatility and positively affected
by the spatial correlation of temperature shocks.
Table 12 establishes a negative statistically and economically significant effect of temperature
volatility and positive significant effect of temperature spatial correlation on preference for cautiousness

Note: Using OLS regression, this table establishes based on the Ethnographic Atlas and the SCCS that preferences for loss aversion is
negatively affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate
uncertainty) in the region. Column 1-5 focus on preference for strategy over luck in games based on v35 in the Ethnographic Atlas,
and column 6 on preference for Sleeping Proximity of Parents to Infant (v23) in the SSCS. Additional geographical controls are
standard deviation of land suitability, distance to coast or river, and the level of precipitation. Ethnographic controls include
intensity of agriculture and animal husbandry, settlement structure, and plow use. Region fixed effects include dummy variables
for Americas, Old World and Africa that may govern the characteristics of ethnic groups. All independent variables have been
normalized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show
the effect of a one standard deviation in the independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at
the parental country of origin level are reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5%
level, and * at the 10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.

at the ethnic group level. The result, based on the EA, is robust for the inclusion of ethnographic
controls (Column 2), additional geographical controls (Columns 3 and 4) and region fixed effects
(Column 5). These results are remarkably stable and remain significant on the 1%- and 5%-level
across specifications.
In addition, a similar qualitative pattern emerges from the analysis of the impact of climatic characteristic on preference for cautiousness in the SCCS. In particular, Column 6 establishes a negative
and highly significant association between temperature volatility and preference for cautiousness, as
captured by the sleeping proximity of parents to infant reported in SCCS, as well as a highly signif-

54

icant positive association between temperature spatial correlation and preference for cautiousness.29
Reassuringly, the results are robust to the potentially confounding effect of the household’s dwelling
structure.

Loss Averse Behavior

This section explores the effect climatic volatility as well as spatial correlation in climatic shocks on the
degree of loss aversion at an ethnic level, as captured by the observed manifestations of loss aversion
in human behavior. In particular, it explores the effect of these climatic characteristics on: (i) the the
diversification in the sources of subsistence consumption, and (ii) choices of crops that are potentially
less vulnerable to climatic fluctuations.
The association between climatic characteristics (and their hypothesized impact on loss aversion)
and the degree of diversification in the production of the subsistence consumption is explored in
Columns (1) and (2) of Table 13. A-priori one would have expected, that in a more volatile environment the degree of diversification will be larger. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that the degree of
diversification of productive activities at the ethnic group level is negatively associated with temperature volatility and positively by its spatial correlation. Thus, ethnic groups that are characterized
by greater climatic volatility tend to be less diversified, reflecting the findings that in volatile environment, the trait of loss-neutrality is dominating, leading naturally to production choices that are based
on higher rates of return rather than loss-avoidance.
The association between climatic characteristics (and their hypothesized impact on loss aversion)
and the choices of crops that are potentially less vulnerable to climatic fluctuations is explored in
Columns (3)-(5) of Table 13. Due to the greater resistance of roots and tubers in comparison to cereals,
to the adverse effects of climatic shocks, one would have expected, a-priori, that roots and tubers would
be adopted in a more volatile environment.30 Nevertheless, the findings suggest that ethnic-groups
that were situated in a regions with greater temperature volatility roots or tubers as less likely to be
the major crops, while those that are situated in regions with higher spatial correlation of temperature
shocks would adopt roots with higher probability.31 These findings reflect the hypothesized selection
29

While sleeping proximity of parents to infants may reflect convenient as well as the fear of loosing a child during
the night, the intricate negative association between climatic volatility and the positive one with spatial correlation is
highly unlikely to be related for preference leisure or convince.
30
Moreover, since volatility increases the risk appropriation by either the government or other individuals (Mayshar
et al., 2016) the adoption of these crops, ceteris paribus, would mitigate the risk of appropriation.
31
In particular, as established in column (5), the result remains highly statistically significant when the confounding

Observations

Notes: Using OLS regression in column 1 – 2 and probit regression in column 3 – 5, this table establishes based on
the Ethnographic Atlas that diversification of activities and choice of crop is negatively affected by the temperature
volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected by the temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty)
in the region. Column 1-2 focus on diversification of production activities based on v1 – v5 in the Ethnographic
Atlas and columns 3 – 5 on choice of roots as a major crop (v29), as opposed to cereals. Additional geographical
controls are land suitability gini, elevation range and precipitation level. Ethnographic controls include settlement
structure and major crops for column 1 – 2 and intensity of agriculture, animal husbandry, settlement structure
and plow use for column 3 – 5. Region fixed effects include dummy variables for Americas, Old World Europe and
Africa. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard
deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard deviation in the independent
variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the parental country of origin level are

higher rates of return rather than loss-avoidance.
effects of potential suitability for roots and cereals are accounted for.

56

Hence, the focus on observed behavior, rather than preferences further establishes the highly
significant negative association between the degree of loss aversion and intertemporal temperature
volatility, as well as positive assassination with spatial correlation of temperature shocks.

Robustness
Selection on Unobservables

This subsection examines the likelihood that omitted variables could alter the qualitative findings.
Table C.4 establishes that it is very improbable that omitted variables could have affected the qualitative results presented in Tables 2 and 4. In particular, as established in column (8) , (using columns
(7) as the baseline specifications), the estimated value of the coefficient on intertemporal temperature
volatility and temperature spatial correlation, if unobservables where as correlated as the observables
(i.e., Oster’s β ∗ statistic), are very close to the estimated OLS coefficients. Furthermore, since zero
does not belong to the interval created by the estimated value on and Oster’s β ∗ , one can reject the
hypothesis that the value of the coefficient is driven exclusively by unobservables. In addition, the
indexes AET (Altonji et al., 2005; Bellows and Miguel, 2009) and δ (Oster, 2014) measure how strongly
correlated unobservables would have to be in order to account for the full size of the coefficient on
temperature volatility and spatial correlation (v and c subscripts correspondingly), are different from
the critical value of 1.

6.2.2

Placebo Tests

This section establishes that the relationship between intertemporal temperature volatility and spatial
correlation in temperature and the proposed proxies of loss aversion are unique to ethnographic characteristics that reflect cautiousness about losses, rather than a broader spectrum of ethnographic traits.
A wide spectrum of placebo tests demonstrates that indeed intertemporal temperature volatility and
spatial correlation in temperature do not affect other cultural characteristics at the ethnic group level.
In particular, as established in Table C.8, ethnographic characteristics such as sex taboos, group’s
political integration, inheritance property rights, gender roles in agriculture, attitude towards premarital sex, and belief in the evil eye are affected neither by intertemporal temperature volatility nor by
the temperature spatial correlation, lending further credence to the proposed hypothesis.

Concluding Remarks

This research explores the origins of loss aversion and the variation in the prevalence of this important
traits across regions, nations, and ethnic groups. It advances the hypothesis and establishes empirically
that the evolution of loss aversion in the course of human history can be traced to the adaptation of
individuals to the asymmetric effects of climatic shocks on reproductive success during the Malthusian
epoch; an era in which adverse climatic conditions could have brought individuals to extinction.
The study develops an evolutionary theory that captures the fundamental asymmetry that the
Malthusian environment has generated with respect to the attitude of individuals towards gains and
loses in productivity, and thus with respect to the evolution of loss aversion.
Exploiting variations in the degree of loss aversion among second generation migrants in Europe
and the US, as well as across precolonial ethnic groups, the research establishes that consistent with
the predictions of the theory, individuals and ethnic groups that are originated in regions in which
climatic conditions tended to be spatially correlated, and thus shocks were aggregate in nature, are
characterized by greater intensity of loss aversion, while descendants of regions marked by climatic
volatility have greater propensity towards loss-neutrality.

Appendix (Supplementary Online Material)
A

Climatic Characteristics and the Evolution of Risk Aversion

This subsection establishes that the predictions of the theory are unique to the evolution of loss
aversion, rather than risk aversion.
First, suppose that the reference point, associated with the subsistence consumption constraint is
either absent or not binding. In particular, suppose that the utility function is of the CRRA type:
1−σ i

i

c c
(nit + )1−σn
ui (cit , nit ) = (1 − γ) it i + γ
,
1 − σc
1 − σni

(44)

where  ≥ 0, σci > 0, and σni > 0.
As established in the subsection 2.7, in the absence of a binding subsistence consumption constraint,
variation in income driven by the differential choices of the production modes would have no effect on
fertility and thus on reproductive success. The composition of risk aversion would therefore remain
intact overtime and the long-run level of risk-aversion would be independent of climatic characteristics.
Second, suppose that the subsistence consumption constraint is present and binding, but individuals are loss-neutral (i.e., θi = 1). Namely, the subsistence consumption is not a reference point and
there is no kink in the utility function at the point, c̃. While the evolutionary forces that operate on
the distribution of risk-aversion around c̃ are qualitatively similar to those that governed the evolution
of loss-aversion, as some risk-neutral individuals gain an evolutionary advantage in the short-run and
departs from the subsistence level, risk-neutrality is no longer evolutionary optimal, and some prudence may generate evolutionary advantage in the long-run, obscuring the link between the climatic
volatility and spatial correlation and the long-run level of risk-aversion. Moreover, the relative degree
of risk-aversion with respect to consumption and fertility would affect the evolutionary process and
would further obscured the link between climatic volatility and spatial correlation and the long-run
level of risk-aversion.

Robustness Checks
Alternative Estimation Method: Probit and Ordered Probit

This subsection establishes that the results obtained in sections 4 and 5 are robust to the use of an
alternative estimation method, rather than OLS. In particular, using Ordered Probit for the ESS and
GSS and Probit for the WVS, one can estimates the probability of observing the ranked preference
(in the ESS and GSS) or the preference for Job Security (in the WVS), conditional on intertemporal
temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) as well as on temperature spatial correlation (aggregate
uncertainty).

Using Ordered Probit regression, this table establishes that the preferred job characteristics of second generation migrants reflect loss
aversion. In particular, their valuation of job security vs other characteristics (salary, short working hours, promotion opportunities
and job satisfaction) and of job security vs. salary is negatively affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively
affected by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the parental country of origin. Additional geographical
controls are land suitability gini, distance to coast or river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and
temperate zones and precipitation level. Individual controls include age, gender, number of siblings, religion, education level, and
income. Sample excludes small island countries. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting their mean and
dividing by their standard deviation. Thus, all coefficients can be compared and show the effect of a one standard deviation in
the independent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard error estimates clustered at the parental country of origin level are
reported in parentheses; *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all for
two-sided hypothesis tests.

In line with the predictions of the theory, as well as with the OLS estimates, as established in
Tables C.1, C.2, and 11 larger temperature spatial correlation increases significantly the probability
that: (i) second generation migrants in Europe, (ii) second generation migrants in the US, and (iii)
individuals in the WVS, will be more loss averse, whereas greater intertemporal temperature volatility
decreases the probability that individuals in these distinct samples will be loss averse.

Observations

Notes: Using Probit regression, this table establishes that individuals’ valuation of job security vs other job characteristics (i.e.,
salary, colleagues, job satisfaction) is negatively affected by temperature volatility (idiosyncratic risk) and positively affected
by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the country of birth. Additional geographical controls are land
suitability gini, distance to coast or river, landlocked dummy, percentage of land in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones
and precipitation level. Individual controls include age, gender, religion, education level, and income. Sample excludes small island
countries. All independent variables have been normalized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation.
All coefficients represent average marginal effects, and since all independent variables have been normalized by subtracting their
mean and dividing by their standard deviation, all coefficients are comparable. Heteroskedasticity robust clustered standard error
estimates are reported in parentheses; clustering at the region of interview and individual characteristics level; *** denotes statistical
significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level, all for two-sided hypothesis tests.

C.2

Selection by Unobservables

This subsection examines the likelihood that omitted variables could alter the qualitative findings.
Table C.4 establishes that it is very improbable that omitted variables could have affected the qualitative results presented in Tables 2 and 4. In particular, as established in Column (2) and (4), (using
Columns (1) and (3) as the baseline specifications), the estimated value of the coefficient on intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation, if unobservables where as correlated
as the observables (i.e., Oster’s β ∗ statistic), are very close to the estimated OLS coefficients. Fur-

64

thermore, since zero does not belong to the interval created by the estimated value on and Oster’s β ∗ ,
one can reject the hypothesis that the value of the coefficient is driven exclusively by unobservables.
In addition, the indexes AET (Altonji et al., 2005; Bellows and Miguel, 2009) and δ (Oster, 2014)
measure how strongly correlated unobservables would have to be in order to account for the full size of
the coefficient on temperature volatility and spatial correlation (v and c subscripts correspondingly),
are mostly different from the critical value of 1.

The Insignificant Role of Preindustrial Development

This subsection establishes that the effect of the climatic variables on loss aversion is orthogonal to the
potentially confounding effect of historical levels of population density, urbanization and income per
capita density. In particular, Table B.X demonstrates that, accounting for population density in 1500,

65

urbanization in 1800, and GDP per capita in 1913, the effects of intertemporal climatic volatility and
temperature spatial correlation on loss aversion in the ESS (columns (1)-(3)), GSS (columns (4)-(6)),
and WVS (columns(7)-(9)) remain stable and mostly highly significant and qualitatively similar.

C.4

Robustness to the Density of Weather Stations

In light of the potential association between the density of weather stations and measurements of
temperature spatial correlation in a given region, one may be concerned about the possibility that
climatic conditions affected the loss aversion via non-evolutionary channels. In particular, variation
in temperature spatial correlation can be partially driven by the differences in the density of the
weather measuring stations, which, in turn, is affected by the contemporary economic and institutional
characteristics of a country, which may have direct effect on the observed rate of loss aversion.
To address this problem base-line results are replicated taking into account the potential confound66

ing effect of the weather measuring stations’ density. In particular, columns (1) and (2) of Table C.6
replicate columns (5) and (6) of Table 2, while controlling for the density of the weather stations,
used to measure the climatic data at hand. Columns (3)-(6) replicate the same exercise for columns
(4)-(7) of Table 4. It is established that the observed level of loss aversion among second generation
migrants in Europe and the US is not directly affected by the density of weather measuring stations,
while the effect of temperature volatility and spatial correlation remains statistically significant and
quantitatively similar to the base-line results.

Insignificant outliers

This subsection examines the potential importance of outliers in the established relationship between
intertemporal temperature volatility and temperature spatial correlation and the emergence of loss
aversion. As depicted in Figures C.1 and C.2 outliers do not appear to govern the observed relationship
in the ESS and the GSS. In particular, as established in Table C.7 the results remain qualitatively
intact if individuals from the Netherlands, that constitute the isolated observation, that may affect
the significance of the association are removed the in Figure C.2, are excluded from the sample.

Placebo Tests: Ethnographic Atlas

This section establishes that the relationship between intertemporal temperature volatility and spatial
correlation in temperature and the proposed proxies of loss aversion are unique to ethnographic characteristics that reflect cautiousness about losses, rather than a broader spectrum of ethnographic traits.
A wide spectrum of placebo tests demonstrates that indeed intertemporal temperature volatility and
spatial correlation in temperature do not affect other cultural characteristics at the ethnic group level.
In particular, as established in Table C.8, ethnographic characteristics such as sex taboos, group’s
political integration, inheritance property rights, gender roles in agriculture, attitude towards premarital sex, and belief in the evil eye are affected neither by intertemporal temperature volatility nor by

Notes: Using OLS regression, this table establishes that the preferred job characteristics of second generation migrants
reflect loss aversion. In particular, their valuation of job security vs all other characteristics (salary, short working

Notes: Using OLS regression, this table establishes that behavioral characteristics that are orthogonal to loss aversion (i.e.,
severity of post-partum sex taboos, level of political integration, presence of property rights, presence of distinct gender
roles in agriculture, norms of premarital sexual behavior and presence of evil eye belief) are neither affected by temperature
volatility (idiosyncratic risk), nor by temperature spatial correlation (aggregate uncertainty) in the parental country of origin.
Additional geographical controls are land suitability standard deviation, distance to coast or river and precipitation level.
Ethnographic controls include intensity of agriculture and animal husbandry, settlement structure and plow use. Region fixed
effects include dummy variables for Americas, Old World and Africa that may govern the characteristics of ethnic groups. All

• Preferred Job Characteristic: Security vs Salary (Second-generation analysis: ESS):
Based on the answers to the question “For you personally, how important do you think each of
the following would be if you were choosing a job? A secure job?/ A high income?” taken from
the “Family work and well-being” module in the second and fifth rounds of the European Social
Survey. Computed as the difference between the importance of characteristics “Secure job” and
“High Income”, normalizing the lowest value to 1 (i.e., ipjbscr - ipjbhin + 5).

32

Hofstede and Hofstede (n.d., p.61) defines it as “Power distance can therefore be defined as the extent to which the
less powerful members of institutions and organizations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed
unequally. Institutions are the basic elements of society, such as the family, the school, and the community; organizations
are the places where people work.”
33
Hofstede and Hofstede (n.d., p.92) defines it as follows: “Individualism pertains to societies in which the ties between
individuals are loose: everyone is expected to look after him- or herself and his or her immediate family. Collectivism as
its opposite pertains to societies in which people from birth onward are integrated into strong, cohesive in-groups, which
throughout people’s lifetime continue to protect them in exchange for unquestioning loyalty.”
34
Hofstede and Hofstede (n.d., p.140) defines this dimension as Masculinity vs Femininity, since he found gender based
differences in the answers to the questions that defined this value.
35
According to Hofstede and Hofstede (n.d., p.191) “Uncertainty avoidance can therefore be defined as the extent to
which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations.”

82

• Regional Data: For regions within a country, data is computed using GIS software to compute
the area of each region’s polygon in the corresponding shape file of the Seamless Digital Chart
of the World. Whenever possible, the same primary data sources as the ones used in the sources
for the country level data is used. E.g. regional agricultural suitability is constructed using the
data from Ramankutty et al. (2002).
