ABSTRACT
Ever since the seminal RAND Health insurance experiment (HIE) was conducted, most health
care services, including pharmaceuticals, are deemed to be price inelastic with price elasticities of
demand (PED) close to -0.20. However, most studies of PED exploit natural experiments that
change demand prices for multiple components of health care. Consequently, these experiments
usually do not produce estimates for the true own-price elasticities of demand but rather
composite own-price elasticities that are driven by concomitant price changes to their substitutes
and complements. Hence, an estimate of price elasticity is expected to vary based on the setting
in which it was estimated, and likely not be applicable to other settings. In this work, exploiting a
natural experiment of exogenous policy implementation of a value-based formulary (VBF) that
was designed based on drug-specific incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, we estimate price
elasticities of pharmaceuticals within a VBF design, formally accounting for the nature of
composite elasticities that such a setting would generate. We also calculate welfare effects of
such a policy using a consumer surplus approach. We show theoretically that VBF designs can
increase dispersion of price elasticities of demand among pharmaceutical products compared to
their true own-price elasticities and affect their magnitude based on direction of price change.
Aligning these PEDs with value VBF is also likely to produce positive welfare effects. We
estimate an overall PED for pharmaceuticals to be -0.16, close to the estimate of RAND HIE.
However, we see substantial dispersion of PED across the VBF tiers ranging from -0.09 to -0.87
with trends aligned with the levels of value as reflected by the cost-effectiveness ratio (p<0.001).
The net welfare increase was $147,000 for the cohort or $28 per member over the post-policy
year. Further experimentations of VBF designs with alternative cost-effectiveness thresholds,
copayment levels and value-definitions could be quite promising for improving welfare.

1. INTRODUCTION
Price (own) elasticity of demand reflects the responsiveness in demand for a product with
respect to its price, ceteris paribus. There is a large literature that has tried to estimate price
elasticities of health care products, including pharmaceuticals. The RAND Health Insurance
Experiment (HIE) was the first to study these effects in a randomized context (Keeler and Rolph
1988; Manning et al. 1987). These estimates are used for a variety of purposes such as setting
optimal coinsurance rates and calculating welfare implications for policies.
Here we will focus on the price elasticity of demand for pharmaceuticals. Typically, when
estimating price elasticity of demand, pharmaceutical products are thought of as one monolithic
product. Analysts then exploit some natural experiments, such as changes in cost-sharing that
applies across all pharmaceutical products, to estimate the responsiveness of pharmaceutical
demand with respect to changes in such cost-sharing. However, within the same setting, when
one tries to look at the price responsiveness of specific classes of pharmaceuticals, one is no
longer able to estimate the true own-price elasticity of demand for that class. This is because,
this class of pharmaceuticals may have substitutes and complements whose demand prices are
also affected by the same natural experiment. Therefore, the ceteris paribus argument no
longer applies. To our knowledge, this limitation of interpreting estimated price elasticities for
specific classes of drugs, when the entire pharmaceutical demand is affected via price changes,
has not been discussed adequately in the literature. It is expected that estimates of total
elasticity of demand for pharmaceuticals would vary considerably depending on how their
substitutes’ and complements’ demand prices were also changing. More importantly, price
responsiveness estimated in one setting may not be generalizable to other settings.
We exploit a similar natural experiment, but in the context of transitioning a cost-based
formulary to a value-based formulary. Typically, pharmaceuticals are groups into tiers within a
health plan’s formulary. These tiers are cost-based, which indicates that drugs with lower
acquisition costs are placed on a lower tier with lower co-insurance rate or copayment High
costs drugs are placed on higher tiers. Such a cost-based formulary incentivizes patients to use
low-cost drugs by offering lower cost-sharing (demand price) for them. Researchers have
exploited natural policy experiments that have changed co-insurance rates of co-payments,
either by increasing or decreasing these amounts within the existing tiers or by adding a new
tier for some of the drugs with a new co-payment level, to calculate the price-elasticity of
pharmaceuticals. Since in most of these experiments, direction of change of demand price is
unilateral, estimates of elasticities from these settings may not be informative about the price
responsiveness of pharmaceuticals within a value-based formulary (VBF) context. A VBF tries
to incentivize patients to use drugs that are likely to produce better value (in terms of patient
2

health net of costs) by assigning drugs to tiers using some notion of value (rather than
acquisition costs) and then simultaneously aligning cost-sharing levels based on value (Chernew
et al. 2008, 2010). VBF can also, at the same time, increase cost-sharing for those drugs that
are likely to produce low value. Two forces drive price responsiveness to a pharmaceutical
product within this setting: 1) Signaling of value to the consumer (physician or patient or
both), 1 which could shift the market demand curve outward or inwards depending on the value
signal, and 2) the own demand price changes and relative demand price changes between the
various substitutes and complements. A VBF may signal information about the value of a drug
to the consumer although it is not clear how much new information it provides beyond what the
prescriber already knows and what she advises the patients on.
In this paper, we assume that the effect of such value signals on the movement of market
demand (among the population studied) is minimal. The primary effect of VBF is realized as it
manipulates the own-demand price and the demand prices for the substitutes and complements
to affect demand behavior along a drug-specific fixed demand curve. We develop a simple
intuitive formulation for the overall price elasticity of demand within a VBF design and provide
empirical estimates of these elasticities through a recent natural experiment of VBF
implementation. Moreover, we provide evidence of how the overall price elasticity of demand
varies by VBF tiers that hinges on some notion of value. We discuss the implication for own
price elasticities within these tiers. We also provide estimates of price elasticities by therapeutic
class, and by brand-generic status. Finally, we provide a framework for welfare calculation for
VBF implementation and provide estimates from the natural experiment.
In the next section (Section 2), we start with a short review of the literature on price
elasticities of demand for pharmaceuticals. Throughout we will use the term “pharmaceutical”,
“drug” and “medication” interchangeably. We start with the RAND HIE and only focus on those
that have exploited a natural experiment to solve the endogeneity problem of price change. In
Section 3, we lay out the price responsiveness of a pharmaceutical product as a function of own
prices and also prices of its substitutes and/or complements and then translate these
expressions to the context of VBF. Finally, we describe how we use these elasticities to
calculate welfare effects of VBF. In Section 4, we describe our data that comes from an
exogenous change in pharmacy benefit in a Preferred Provider Organization employersponsored plan in the Pacific Northwest that, in 2010, implemented a VBF benefit among their
own employees and dependents that explicitly used cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to
determine medication copayments. We also describe the methods that we use to estimate the
price elasticities of demand. Section 5 presents the results and some robustness checks for our

Section 6.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW

Overall price responsiveness for pharm aceuticals
The RAND HIE, conducted from 1974 to 1981, is the only randomized study to produce
estimates for price elasticities of demand for pharmaceuticals (Manning et al. 1987). The
results of the HIE are still held as a standard by which other studies are compared. This study,
which randomized 5,809 non-elderly individuals to four different levels of coinsurance and three
levels of maximum out of pocket expenditures, found an overall elasticity estimate for
pharmaceuticals of -0.17, which means that a 10% increase in cost-sharing results in a 1.7%
reduction in utilization of pharmaceuticals (Keeler and Rolph 1988).
It is important to note that that this estimate should only be interpreted as the own-price
elasticity of pharmaceuticals if other health care services are not substitutes or complements for
pharmaceuticals. This is because the experiment changed cost-sharing for not only
pharmaceuticals but also other health care services simultaneously. To the extent any of these
services serve as a substitute or complement to pharmaceuticals, the total elasticity would be
the sum of the own price elasticity and other components. We study this more formally in
Section 3.
More recent observational studies have produced overall elasticity of demand estimates on
total drug costs ranging from -0.33 to -0.12 (Joyce et al. 2002; Contoyannis et al. 2005; Gilman
and Kautter 2008; Chandra et al. 2010, 2014). Chernew et al. (2008) found the elasticity of
demand on drug adherence to range from -0.18 to -1.2. Other studies have estimated
elasticities by medication class. Goldman et al. (2004) looked at elasticities with respect to drug
days and found slightly higher elasticities for NSAIDs (-0.45), antihistamines (-0.44), antihyperlipidimics (-0.34), anti-asthmatics (-0.32), anti-hypertensives (-0.26), antidepressants (0.26) and antidiabetics (-0.25). Landsman et al. (2005) estimated elasticities with respect to
number of prescriptions and surprisingly found lower elasticities for drugs used in asymptomatic
conditions (-0.10 to -0.16 for ACE inhibitors, statins etc.) and higher elasticities for drugs used
in symptomatic conditions (-0.24 to -0.60 for Cox-e inhibitors, NSAIDs, SSRIs etc.). Finally,
Gatwood et al. (2014) looked at medication fills and found elasticities ranging from -0.02 to 0.16 across eight medication classes. _ENREF_13Based on these estimates, it is usually inferred
that pharmaceuticals are price-inelastic in nature and there is not much variability in the price4

elasticity of demand across drug classes. However, an argument can be made that these total
elasticities estimated through these natural experiments underestimate of the own-price
elasticity. This is because of three reasons: pharmaceuticals are likely to have more substitutes
than complements, relative changes to prices across these substitutes are positive (i.e. price
changes are in the same direction), and that the cross–price elasticity for substitutes are
expected to be positive. Hence, the estimated total price elasticity of demand for a drug is likely
to be biased towards zero due to the addition of these positive effects. In essence,
pharmaceutical demand could be quite elastic if demand prices for specific drugs are targeted
instead of an overall group that includes many of its substitutes. This notion aligns with the
rationale for a VBF design.
Moreover, estimating price responsiveness at the drug level rather than at the group level
may be more suitable to unmask variations of total elasticities for specific medications, which
can then be grouped in many different ways. For example, when estimating elasticity, many
studies utilize panel data from natural experiments in which prescription drug cost-sharing was
increased.4,8,9,11,15,16 This increase in cost-sharing may occur differentially, with cost-sharing
increases being greater for branded medications than for generic medications.15 Cost-sharing
increases may also be greater for non-preferred branded medications than for preferred
branded medications.8,9,16 The studies deal with these differential increases in cost-sharing by
constructing plan level or medication class level cost-sharing indexes and then comparing
medication utilization across plans and time.10,12-14 These studies implicitly only capture changes
in mean cost-sharing at the plan (or medication class) level and do not account for differential
changes in cost-sharing within a plan or medication class in order to estimate elasticities at the
individual drug level. In this study, we empirically estimate the composite or total price elasticity
of demand at the drug level (taking into account own and cross price elasticities) and aggregate
them to estimate the overall elasticity of pharmaceuticals, and by medication copayment tier
and a few prevalent drug classes.

3. THEORY

Dem and as a Function of Ow n and Cross Price Effects
The level of demand for a particular (index) medication depends on both the price of the
medication and the prices of its substitutes/complements. Since there are fewer examples of
complement pharmaceutical pairs as compared to substitutes, we will focus the discussion on
substitutes. However, the same framework can be used for complements and a mix of
substitutes and complements. In the context of price changes for both the medication and its
substitutes, as is typical when the overall benefit design for pharmaceuticals change, even
5

exogenously, the demand for the index medication will depend on its own and cross price
elasticities of demand and the relative changes in prices of the medications. We first illustrate
this with an example involving only two medications, then we extend our example to multiple
medications and then to an example involving value-based cost-sharing.
For two medications, the demand for medication 1 (D1) is a function of the (demand) price
of both medication 1 (P1) and medication 2 (P2).
(1)

𝐷1 (𝑃1 , 𝑃2 )

The total change in demand for medication 1 (dD1) is a function of the changes in prices,
dP1 and dP2, and the effect of the changes in prices on the demand for medication 1:

Note that in (2), the cross-price effect

medications 1 and 2 are substitutes.

Therefore, the “overall” elasticity of demand for the index medication with respect to its
𝑃� 𝑑𝐷 (𝑃 ,𝑃 )
own price, denoted by 𝜃11 = �1 · 1 1 2 , is comprised of: 1) the true own price elasticity of

demand of medication 1 (η11) and 2) a second term represents the product of the true cross

price elasticity of medication 1 with respect to medication 2 prices (η12) and the elasticity of
price of medication 2 relative to medication 1 prices (ε21).

𝜃11 = η11 + η12 · 𝑑𝑃2 · 𝑃�1

𝜃11 = η11 + η12 · ε21

(4b)

This shows that the overall elasticity of demand for medication 1 will depend on whether

medication 1 and 2 are substitutes (η12 > 0) or complements (η12 < 0) and on the relative
change in the price of medication 2 with respect to medication 1. For example, if medications 1
and 2 are substitutes (η12 > 0) and the relative change in the price of medication 2 is large (ε21
>> 1), then it is possible that overall elasticity of demand for medication 1 is positive despite
the own price elasticity of demand for medication 1 being negative (η11 < 0).

6

Generalizing our model to J medications, we see that the overall elasticity of demand for
medication 1, 𝜃11 , is the sum of η11 plus the sum of the product of the cross price elasticity of
demand for medication 1 with respect to medication j prices (η1𝑗 ) and the elasticity of prices for

medication j with respect to medication 1 (ε𝑗1 ):
𝜃11 = η11 + ∑𝐽𝑗=2 η1𝑗 · ε𝑗1

(5)

Note that, these elasticities can also be interpreted as the elasticities with respect to the
demand prices, where the patient only faces a fraction (co-payment) of the overall price for
each drug. We will interpret price elasticities as demand price elasticities throughout the paper.

Im plications of VB F on price responsiveness
A VBF design offers lower cost-sharing for drugs that are of high value and high cost
sharing for drugs that are of low value. Therefore, a VBF affects the overall price
responsiveness of a medication through two ways. First, it signals the value of that medication,
more explicitly, by assigning the drug to a high (low value) versus low (high value) tier. This
information alone can shift the market demand curve outward or inward depending on the
overall value signal of a prescription and its substitutes. However, it does not provide any new
information on effectiveness that does not already exist in the medical community. Hence we
assume that the effect of such signaling mechanism is minimal is shifting market demand curve.
The second way in which VBF affects overall price responsiveness is through demand prices and
is perhaps the most direct and the strongest way. The VBF structurally influences the elasticity
of relative (demand) prices (ε𝑗1 ) so that low value drugs experience large positive price changes
and high value drugs experiences small positive or even negative price changes. This

mechanism, we believe, is driving price responsiveness in this setting. Therefore, a high value

drug that has low own price elasticity (i.e. is inelastic) can be made even more price inelastic in
a VBF setting by increasing the relative prices of its low valued substitutes. In fact, if the
increases in prices of the low value drugs were large enough, it if possible that increase in price
of the high value drug would still lead to increase in consumption of the drug leading to welfare
gains. These dynamics are fundamental to understanding the welfare effects of a VBF policy
and are described below.
Following our stylized example above, let’s consider two drugs that are substitutes. Also,
let’s assume for simplicity that 𝑃�1 = 𝑃�2 . Then under a traditional unidirectional and similar shift
in costs sharing, ε𝑗1 = 1, and the overall price elasticity of demand for drug 1 is given as,
𝜃11,𝑇𝑟 = η11 + η12 .

7

Certainly, 𝜃11,𝑇𝑟 > η11 since η12 > 0, indicating that in traditional setting demand price shifts for

all drugs in the same direction would produce more inelastic demand estimates than the true
own-price elasticity.

Under a VBF setting, suppose drug 2 is of lower value. So a VBF would separate the
demand price for the two drugs making drug 2 more expensive than drug 1. There are two
ways a VBF can enforce price changes: 1) 𝑑𝑃1 >0 & 𝑑𝑃2 >>0, or 2) 𝑑𝑃1 <0 & 𝑑𝑃2 >0. Note

however,

If 𝑑𝑃1 >0 & 𝑑𝑃2 >>0 :

η11 < 0,

η12 > 0, ε21 > 1

 𝜃11 > 𝜃11, 𝑇𝑟 > η11

Thus, if higher value drug 1 experiences a price increase, VBF makes its demand more inelastic
by changing the price of its low value substitutes even higher. Thus, not many people are
deterred from using this high value drug 1 despite of an increase in price. In fact, it is possible
that overall elasticity for a good value drug could even be positive under the VBF setting. In
contrast,
If 𝑑𝑃1 <0 & 𝑑𝑃2 >0 :

η11 < 0,

η12 > 0, ε21 < 0

 𝜃11 < η11 <𝜃11, 𝑇𝑟

Thus if the high value drug experiences a decrease in price, VBF makes its demand more elastic
to allow more people to take up the drug.
One can also look at the effect of VBF on the price elasticities of the low-value drugs. We
reverse order that consider drug 1 to be the low-valued drug and drug 2 to be the high valued
drug. In that case,
If 𝑑𝑃1 >>0 & 𝑑𝑃2 >0 :

Similarly,

η11 < 0,

η12 > 0, ε21 < 1

 𝜃11, 𝑇𝑟 >𝜃11 >η11

If 𝑑𝑃1 >0 & 𝑑𝑃2 < 0 :

η11 < 0,

η12 > 0, ε21 < 0

 𝜃11 < η11 <𝜃11, 𝑇𝑟

With a price increase for the low value drug, the VBF makes the demand for the low value

drug more elastic than in the traditional setting thus encouraging patient to reduce use of this
drug.

W elfare Effects of the VB F
Following traditional economic theory, the true own price elasticity of demand is assumed to
be negative, implying that as demand price falls, consumption increases ceteris paribus. Under
a traditional insurance design, patients pay a fraction of the price of a drug. It is expected that
there is an inherent welfare loss due to moral hazard, as patients would consume the drug even
when its marginal value is lower than its marginal price. If the demand is price elastic
8

(inelastic), as would be expected with a low(high)-value drug, the moral hazard would be large
(small).17
The elasticity of a drug also is driven by the availability of substitutes and their prices. For
example, demand price responsiveness for a low-value drug can be low if this drug has no
available substitutes or if the available substitutes are themselves of low value and/or high
price. In this case, despite being low value, the true own price elasticity of the original drug
can be low (inelastic). Indeed the literature has shown that, on average, generic medications
(which are likely to have more expensive branded substitutes) have lower price elasticities
compared to branded medication (which are likely to have more low cost generic substitutes).15
In the VBF setting, there are bidirectional changes to demand prices to different drugs. For
drugs whose demand prices increase, we expect that there will be welfare gains due to the
decrease in moral hazard. Alternatively, for drugs whose demand prices decrease, moral hazard
increases along with decline in welfare. However, aligning these price changes with the
underlying value of drugs, a VBF design can increase the dispersion in price elasticities,
compared to those present based on true own price elasticity. Therefore, a VBF design is likely
to make a high-value drug more inelastic and a low value drug more elastic than its own true
price elasticity would suggest. Consequently, we expect that, on average, the change in
welfare loss brought about by a VBF design that is able to align demand with value will be
positive.
One challenge in welfare calculations is to understand the marginal costs of the drugs. For
example, for a branded drug, the total reimbursed plus out-of pocket costs amount to the
market price of the drug (sans discount that the insurer may receive from the manufacturer).
However, this market price should not be used to estimate welfare since it does not reflect the
marginal costs of the drug due to the monopoly mark-up. The long-run marginal costs of the
drug should also account for the R&D costs of developing and commercializing the drug. The
Second Panel for Cost-Effectiveness recommends using the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS)
prices for the long-run marginal costs of drugs from a societal perspective, since prevailing
transaction prices with a social insurer will usually act as a serviceable way to reflect the
production costs of the drugs from a societal perspective (Basu, 2016). In our case, we were
unable to obtain the FSS prices for every drug in our sample. Instead, we use 40% and 100%
of the observed market prices to reflect FSS prices for all branded and generic drugs
respectively.18
Consider that copayments (demand price) levels changed from level P1 to P1* for a drug and
the long-run marginal costs be denoted by SMC. The associated change in welfare loss will
depend on the following conditions: 1) if P1* > or < P1; and 2) if SMC > P1 and SMC > P1*; OR
9

3) if P1* > SMC > P1 or if P1* < SMC < P1; OR 4) if SMC < P1 and SMC < P1*. It is expected
that for generic drugs 1) and 2) always holds. However, for branded drugs, any of the
conditions may hold. Consequently, the welfare calculations for each combination of these
conditions are illustrated in Figure 1.
Assuming that high-value drugs would be, on average, less price elastic than low-value
drugs, the welfare losses from price decreases from high value drugs could be more than offset
by the welfare gains from price increases of low-value drugs within a VBF. To the extent that
these high value and low-value drugs are substitutes for each other, the total price
responsiveness would be tempered for high value drugs while they would be made more
sensitive for low-value drugs within a VBF. For example, the overall price responsiveness (say,
𝜃11 ) for the high value drug with a decrease in its demand prices could be much lower than its

own price elasticity (η11 ) would suggest since it is reinforced positively by η12 and ε21 since

both would be positive under a VBF design and ε21 > 1. Therefore, the welfare loss associated

with the decrease in demand price for this drug within a VBF will be smaller than what would be
expected if that demand price would have changed ceteris paribus. In essence, a VBF is likely

to increase dispersion in price responsiveness of drugs. To what extent a specific VBF design
can affect total welfare will require empirical estimation. This will be driven by not only the own
price-elasticity of each medication but also the number of medications with increases in
copayment, the number of medications with decreases in copayment, the substitutability
between these medications and the magnitudes of the copayment changes. More importantly, it
will depend on the specific operationalization of “value” used to design the VBF.
Our empirical exercise presented below exploits a natural experiment where costeffectiveness results are used to proxy value and thereby demand price changes correlate with
the drug-specific incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. This is an important operationalization of
“value” due to the use of CEA across the world to make value arguments. However, perception
of value may be different for prescribers and patients, and therefore, these demand price
changes may not systematically correlated with elasticity. To understand this correlation, we
study the price-responsiveness of demand to the cost-effectiveness-based tiers used in the VBF
setting. We will produce nuanced price elasticities and welfare effects in this setting that can be
used to project welfare effects under other VBF designs.

4. EMPIRICAL EXAMPLE

Institutional Setting and Data
In 2010, Premera Blue Cross, a large non-profit health plan in the Pacific Northwest
implemented a VBF benefit among their employees and dependents, which explicitly used CEA
to inform medication copayments. The design and implementation of the VBF has been
described in detail elsewhere.2 Briefly, Premera pharmacists who are trained in economic
evaluation gather available CEA estimates and, when necessary, produce de novo estimates. An
external panel of clinical, economic, and public experts uses the ICER estimates along with
information on additional social or ethical values to assign the medication to the appropriate
copayment tier. The ICER estimate using the comparator representing the standard of care for
the clinical indication with the highest expected prescription volume was considered.
Medications with high ICERs are placed on high copayment tiers to disincentivize use and
medications with low ICERs are placed on low copayment tiers to incentivize use. Table 1 shows
the pharmacy benefits in the pre-policy and post-policy periods for the intervention and control
groups. In the contrast, the medical benefits did not change for either the intervention and
control groups over the period of observation.
The initial sample was composed of the entire population of employees and dependents
aged 0-64 who were covered under Preferred Provider Organization employer sponsored plans
administrated by Premera Blue Cross, the largest private health plan in Washington State. The
sample was restricted to include only individuals continuously enrolled at least one year prior to
VBF implementation. The intervention group was composed of employees and dependents of
Premera in an employer sponsored plan that implemented the VBF on July 2010. The control
group was composed of employees and dependents of two employer sponsored plans
administrated by Premera that did not implement the VBF. These plans were chosen based on
similarity to the intervention group prior to VBF implementation in industry classification,
member geography of residence, medication copayment tiers and without any changes in
pharmacy benefits over the entire study period.
From July 2009 through June 2011, we obtained quarterly measures on demographics (age,
sex, ZIP code of residence, relationship to employee), and prescription fills (National Drug
Code, hierarchical ingredient code, therapeutic class, brand-generic status, number of days’
supply, date dispensed, place of purchase (retail or mail order pharmacy)) for each member in
our sample. We used data on individual’s ZIP code of residence to link to ZIP code level

Our focus on health plans that had pharmacy benefit structures consisting of fixed dollar
copays with no deductibles, no co-insurance provisions, no maximum expenditure limits and no
coverage for out-of-network pharmacies results in a linear price schedule for cost-sharing. Since
the copays were changed exogenously with the VBF implementation in our intervention arm, it
allows for allow for a clean medication level analysis. The unique combinations of active
ingredient (hierarchical ingredient code), dosage form and brand-generic status defined every
medication in our data. Every member in our sample had a choice to fill any of these
medications in any month. This is the basic unit by which copayment tiers, including VBF tiers,
were assigned. Therefore copayments are homogenous within a unique combination at a given
time (after taking into account mail order status).

Em pirical Approach
Demand Price or Copayment
Our primary explanatory variable was the expected copayment amount for each medication
faced by a member in a given quarter. Unfortunately, the tier status of each of these
medications, both before and after VBF implementation in the intervention group was not
observed in the dataset. However, because of the linear price schedule and the homogenous
copays for each medication, we are able to infer the tiers for each drug based on the observed
copayments. Naturally, this approach restricted us to use only those medications that were
filled in every quarter of observation by at least one person in the intervention group. In
contrast, the tier status and their corresponding copayments, which did not change over the
duration of our study period for the control group, were observed in the dataset. This limited
our analysis to 269 unique medications, which accounted for 79.3% of the prescription
medication volume over the period of observation.
We infer these marginal medication-specific copayments for each quarter by calculating the
mean copayment observed for retail and mail order claims separately. VBF copayment tier
assignments were applied in the same manner for both retail and mail order benefits. However,
mail order copayment amounts are 2.5 times the copayment amount for a retail claim but
provide three times the quantity of medication (this multiple was not impacted by the VBF). We
calculate the weighted mean copayment for every medication in a given quarter by weighting
the mean retail and mail copayments in that quarter with the proportion of retail and mail
claims for that medication during the pre-policy year. Therefore, the post-policy quantities do
not affect the weighted mean copayment levels and changes in these demand prices were only
driven by the implementation of the VBF formulary, considered to be exogenous in nature.
These weighted co-payment levels are denoted as factual copayment levels, which represent
12

the mean prices a consumer truly faced for a given medication in a given quarter. The factual
copayments were calculated separately for the intervention and control groups. For the
intervention group, we also derived the counterfactual copayment for each medication in the
post-policy period for the VBF cohort, reflecting the price a consumer would have faced for a
given medication in the post-policy period for the VBF cohort had the price of the medication
not been changed by the VBF policy. These counterfactual copayment levels were based on
calculating the average copayment for each medication during the pre-policy period and then
multiplying by pre-policy period mail and retail weights. The control group was used to adjust
for any temporal changes during this time period.

Econometric estimation-utilization
We modeled the probability of filling each medication in a given quarter as well as the
number of fills of the medication using two-part models. For each part, we utilized a differencein-differences estimator to account for unobserved time-varying and non-time-varying
confounders. For the first part, we used probit regression to estimate the probability of fill (Eq.
1). For the second part, we used a generalized linear model with a logarithmic link function and
a Poisson distribution2 to estimate the number of days’ supply, given a fill (Eq. 2). We combined
the first and second part regressions to obtain an overall estimate of the effect of copayment
changes on number of fills of a medication per quarter. The two-part model has the following
specification:
Part 1: Φ−1 [𝐸(𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑡)| ∙ ] = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑖𝑑𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑑 𝑟𝑥𝑑 + 𝛽3𝑑𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑖𝑑𝑡 ∗ 𝑟𝑥𝑑 +
𝛼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑛𝑖𝑑𝑡 + 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑡 + 𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑑𝑡

Part 2: 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝐸 [𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑡| 𝐴𝑛𝑦 𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑑 ] = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑖𝑑𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑟𝑥𝑑 + 𝛽3𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑖𝑑𝑡 ∗
𝑟𝑥𝑑 + 𝛼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑛𝑖𝑑𝑡 + 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑡 + 𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑑𝑡
(7)
Here, filled and number of fills are subscripted for individual i, medication d and quarter t.

Copay is the mean copayment in the VBF or control groups for drug d at quarter t. The rxd is a
fixed effect for drug d. Regression covariates in both models include age, sex, Washington state
residence, zip-code median household income, proportion of urban residents, proportion of
African-American persons, and proportion of individuals with bachelor's degrees,. Quarter

A negative binomial distribution was considered for the second part regression. However, the outcome (count of
fills conditional on having a fill) was not overdispersed (variance = 1.0, mean = 1.8) and the Pearson’s correlation
test, and modified Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated similar goodness of fit for both poisson and negative binomial
distribution models.

indexes tri-monthly periods centered on VBF policy implementation (July 2010), and season are
fixed effects for calendar month to account for seasonal effects.
Using the above models, we estimate the relationship between the observed medication
utilization and the observed copayment. Then, based on the estimated model, we utilize the
observed (factual) copayment to predict the factual medication utilization in the VBF group. We
then utilized the counterfactual copayments (i.e. the copayment faced by a consumer in the
VBF group had the copayment not changed) to predict the counterfactual medication utilization.
The factual and counterfactual copayments and medication utilization estimates are used to
calculate elasticities and welfare changes as described in the following sections.
We accounted for repeated observations by clustering our regressions by member. We
assessed overall model fit using the following goodness-of-fit tests: Pearson’s correlation test,
Pregibon link test, and a modified Hosmer-Lemeshow test.21,22 We generated standard errors
and confidence intervals by 1000 bootstrap replications.

Econometric estimation-price elasticity of demand
We computed elasticities for the total number of fills of a medication using the combined
results of the two-part models. We first estimated the overall elasticity for the entire set of
medications included in the analysis. We next estimated elasticities for medications in each of
the five VBF copayment tiers, then for medications in five therapeutic classes as defined by the
American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS) Pharmacologic-Therapeutic Classification: Statins,
Beta2 Receptor-Blockers, Proton Pump Inhibitors, ACE-Inhibitors, and Biguanides. We select
these classes because of the high prevalence in their use. Finally, we estimated elasticities for
brand versus generic medications. For each group-level elasticity estimate, we weight the drugspecific estimates within that group by the number of fills for each medication in the VBF group
in the pre-policy period. We use a non-parametric trend test to assess whether there is a trend
in elasticity estimates based on VBF copayment tier placement.23

Econometric estimation-welfare effects
We approximate the welfare effects using our regression-based model predictions. We
predicted quantity demanded given the factual and counterfactual copayment levels and the
quantity demanded given the marginal cost of the medication. Using the predicted quantities
and the copayments and the social marginal costs approximated using principles laid out earlier,
we calculate these welfare effects as shown in Figure 1 and as follows using the area of a right
trapezoid or a triangle. If marginal cost is greater than both copayment levels (Figure 1a;
14

SMC> P1*>P1 or SMC>P1> P1*) or if marginal cost is less than both copayment levels (Figure
1c; P1> P1*>SMC or P1*>P1>SMC) then the welfare change is:
∗
∗
) + (𝑆𝑀𝐶𝑖𝑑𝑡 − 𝑃1,𝑖𝑑𝑡 )) · (𝑄1,𝑖𝑑𝑡 − 𝑄1,𝑖𝑑𝑡
))
∆𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑑𝑡 = (0.5 · ((𝑆𝑀𝐶𝑖𝑑𝑡 − 𝑃1,𝑖𝑑𝑡

(8)

where “P1*” is the factual copayment and “Q1*” is the factual estimate of demand (i.e. with VBF
policy) while “P1” is the counterfactual copayment and “Q1” is the counterfactual estimate of
demand (i.e. if there was no VBF policy). “SMC” is the social marginal cost. We calculate the
welfare change (∆welfare) for each enrollee (i), medication (d), and quarter (t) in the VBF
group in the post-policy period. Under Figure 1a scenario, if factual demand (under VBF) is less
than counterfactual demand (under old regime), welfare increases and vice versa. The opposite
is true for the Figure 1c scenario.
If the social marginal cost is between the old and new copayment levels (Figure 2b) then
the welfare change is:
∗
∗
� · (𝑀𝑄𝑖𝑑𝑡 − 𝑄1,𝑖𝑑𝑡
∆𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑑𝑡 = ((0.5 · �𝑆𝑀𝐶𝑖𝑑𝑡 − 𝑃1,𝑖𝑑𝑡
)) − ((0.5 · �𝑆𝑀𝐶𝑖𝑑𝑡 − 𝑃1,𝑖𝑑𝑡 �

· �𝑀𝑄𝑖𝑑𝑡 − 𝑄1,𝑖𝑑𝑡 �)

(9)

“MQ” is the quantity demanded when price is at marginal cost and is predicted using our
estimated models.
We calculate welfare effects at the individual- drug combination level so that we can
aggregate the net welfare effects across any drug class or subgroups. Pooling across our twopart models, we estimate net welfare change induced by VBF copayment changes at the
individual-drug combination level. We calculate the aggregated welfare effects separately for
medications with decreases in copayment and those with increases. We next obtain the overall
welfare change across enrollees, medications, and quarter by calculating the sum of the welfare
changes:
∆𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑒 = ∑𝑛𝑖=1 ∑𝑛𝑑=1 ∑𝑛𝑡=1 𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑒∆𝑖𝑑𝑡

Results
The intervention group and control group were composed of 5,235 and 4,357 individuals,
respectively (Table 2). Since our unit of analysis is at the individual-quarter-drug level, we have
over 20 million observations (=9592X8X269). The intervention group did differ from the control
group in some demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Notably, the intervention group
had slightly higher median household income ($68,900, sd=$18,500 vs $66,100 sd=$24,300)
15

and were slightly younger (32.9 yrs. sd=17.6 yrs. vs 33.9 yrs. sd=18.2 yrs.). As specified a

priori, we controlled for these and other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The
unadjusted percentage of prescriptions filled by the mail order pharmacy benefit did not differ
in the pre-policy and post-policy periods for the intervention (8.76% vs. 8.54%) or control
group (7.95% vs. 7.32%). Before applying the study requirement of continuous enrollment in
the pre-policy period, the rates of attrition (results not shown) did not differ between VBF and
control groups in the pre-policy periods. After applying the study requirement of continuous
enrollment in the pre-policy period, the rates of attrition (results not shown) also did not differ
between VBF and control groups in the post-policy period.
In a previous study (Kai et al. 2016), we evaluated the impact of this VBF policy on
medication expenditures from member, health plan, and member plus health plan (overall)
perspectives. We also measured as secondary outcomes, medication utilization, emergency
department visits, hospitalizations, office visits, and non-medication expenditures using these
data over a slightly longer period of time. We assessed changes using an interrupted trends
analysis with generalized estimating equations. In the intervention group after VBF
implementation, member medication expenditures increased by $2 per member per month
(PMPM) (95% CI, $1 to $3) or 9%, while health plan medication expenditures decreased by $10
PMPM (95% CI, $18 to $2) or 16%, resulting in a net decrease of $8 PMPM (95% CI, $15 to
$2) or 10%, which translates to a net savings of $1.1 million. Utilization of medications moved
into lower copayment tiers increased by 1.95 days’ supply (95% CI, 1.29 to 2.62) or 17%. Total
medication utilization, health services utilization and non-medication expenditures did not
change. There were no differences in pre-period trends between the intervention and control
group and the effect of VBF was found to be an intercept shift in the post period with no effect
on the differential trends. This makes our difference-in-difference strategy for this analysis
valid.
For the current analysis, Figure 2 shows the regression-based predictions of a $1 increase in
copayment on the quarterly probability of fill per member (i.e. first part of the two part model,
Figure 2a) and the number fills per member for each drug conditional on having a fill (i.e.
second part of the two part model, Figure 2b) as well as the total number of fills per member
(i.e. combination of the two part model, Figure 2b). As suggested by our composite elasticity
formulation, some medications had predicted increases in quantity demanded despite
copayment increases. However, for each measure of quantity, there were more medications
with predicted decreases than increases in quantity demanded. It is also important to note that
the effect of the price change manifest mostly on the intensive margin rather than the extensive
margin of fills.
16

We find that overall price elasticity of demand was -0.16 (95% CI: -0.23, -0.09) (Table 2).
Hence, a doubling of copayment faced by the enrollees in this study is expected to reduce the
number of fills of a medication by 16%.
Our elasticity estimates by VBF copayment tier were -0.09 (95% CI, -0.11 to -0.07) for
medications placed in the preventive tier, -0.06 (95% CI, -0.18 to 0.05) for medications placed
in tier 1, -0.60 (95% CI, -0.7 to -0.49) for medications placed in tier 2, -0.77 (95% CI to -0.93,
-0.6) for medications placed in tier 3, and -0.87 (95% CI, -1.16 to -0.58) for medications placed
in tier 4. Based on the trend test, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no trend in
elasticities comparing copayment tiers (p < 0.01). This suggests that patients seem to be more
price sensitive to drugs placed in higher ICER-informed copayment tiers than drugs placed in
lower ICER-informed copayment tiers given the VBF design.
More importantly, as expected based on the theoretical discussions in the previous section,
we find that for VBF Tier 1 drugs, which represent good value, price elasticity was larger for
those that experienced price decreases but smaller for those that experienced price increases.
Similarly, for drugs placed in higher VBF tiers, which represent lower value, price increases were
associated with much higher price elasticities.
The elasticity estimates for statins, beta blockers, PPIs, ACE inhibitors, and biguanides were
-0.41 (95% CI, -0.47 to -0.35), -0.09 (95% CI, -0.15 to -0.03),-0.69 (95% CI, -0.88 to -0.5), 0.04 (95% CI, -0.08 to 0.01), and -0.17 (95% CI, -0.24 to -0.11), respectively. The branded
PPI are expected to show higher elasticity to price due to the availability of non-prescription
substitutes (generic PPI and H2-blockers). More importantly, within a drug class, where each
drug can be considered to be substitute for each other, PEDs align with the theoretical
predictions. For example, within the statins group, statins that increased in price (indicating low
value) have substantially high PED than their high value counterparts.
Our estimates for branded and generic medications were -0.76 (95% CI, -0.86 to -0.65) and
-0.03 (95% CI, -0.09 to 0.04), respectively.
Overall, we find that the welfare increases due to copayment increases more than offset the
welfare loss from copayment decreases. We find that for medications with copayment
increases, total welfare gain was $210,000 for the cohort in the post-policy period or $40 per
member while for medications with copayment decreases, welfare loss was -$63,000 or -$12
per member, therefore the net welfare gain was $147,000 for the cohort or $28 per member.
Assessing welfare changes by copayment tiers, we find that there was net welfare loss in the
preventive tier (-$62,000), primarily due to decreases of demand prices, and net welfare gains
in tiers one ($97,000), two ($89,000), three ($18,000) and four ($4,000).

5. ROBUSTNESS CHECKS
We examined whether our findings were affected by our inclusion criteria: individuals were
not required to be continuously enrolled in the post-policy period. We assessed an alternative
specification in which we required individuals to be enrolled for the entire period of study. This
reduced our sample size to 4,252 members and 3,789 members in the intervention and control
groups, respectively. The results are similar to the findings of our primary analysis (Table 5).

6. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
In this study, we present a formal framework to explain consumer medication utilization
behavior in the context of differential changes in copayments that incorporates cross price
elasticity and own price elasticity effects into a model of observed composite elasticity.
Specifically, our model predicts that when copayments decrease for a (high value) medication
and increase for its (low value) substitutes, we would find greater price elasticity than would be
expected had either the medication or its substitute been subject to a copayment change (but
not both). We further extend our model to predict welfare effects. All else being equal, our
model predicts that welfare loss due to copayment decreases for high value medications (which
we expect to have inelastic demand) will be smaller than welfare gains from copayment
increases for low value medications (which we expect to have elastic demand). We empirically
estimated the composite price elasticity of demand and welfare changes in a VBF that had
differential changes in copayments.
Our overall elasticity estimate of -0.16 is similar to the estimate from the RAND HIE and the
estimates from observation studies using instrumental variable methods. This indicates that
pharmaceutical drugs are less likely to be substitutes or complements with other medical
services. This does not mean that certain drugs cannot offset other medical expenditures in the
long-term, but it implies that other medical services are not considered substitutes or
compliments at the point of demand for pharmaceuticals. For the elasticity estimates by
copayment tiers, we observed a trend of increasing elasticity with increasing copayment tiers.
That is, consumers seemed to be more price sensitive to medications placed into higher
copayment tiers. This may be a direct consequence of the VBF policy: to cause substitution of
medications in higher copayment tiers for medications in lower copayment tiers. Further, for
medications placed in the same VBF copayment tier, medications with decreases in copayment
were more elastic than medications with increases in copayment. This is most clearly observed
for medications in copayment tier one. Medications with decreases in copayment had an
18

elasticity estimate of -0.52 and medications with increases in copayment had an elasticity
estimate of -0.02. This may also be a direct consequence of the VBF to differentially increase
utilization of medications in lower copayment tiers relative medications in higher copayment
tiers. For example, this difference in elasticity estimates is greater in medications in tier one
than tier two likely because the substitution effect is stronger in tier one than in tier two.
We found that the net effect of the VBF on welfare was positive. That is, the welfare loss
decreases due to copayment increases more than offset the welfare loss increases due to
copayment increases. This finding suggests that despite copayment decreases for some
medications, the VBF can increase overall welfare by copayment increases. There may be
multiple reasons for this finding. It may be that there were more medications with copayment
increases, the magnitude of the copayment increases were larger than the copayment
decreases, and the overall utilization of medications with copayment increases were greater.
Indeed, we find evidence for these factors since the overall mean utilization-weighted
copayment across all medications increased comparing the post VBF period to the pre VBF
period. Finally, the substitution effect may also contribute to the finding. The bidirectional
changes in copayments resulted in greater composite elasticity for medications with larger
copayment increases (low value) because their high-valued substitutes may be experiencing
lower copayment increases or copayment decreases. Similarly, the VBF generates lower
composite elasticity for medications with smaller copayment increases or copayment decreases
(high value) since their low-valued substitutes are experiencing larger increases in copayments.
These results should be considered while acknowledging several limitations. First, this was a
natural experiment performed without randomization. Although we performed robustness
checks to assess for identification biases and our elasticity estimates overall, by therapeutic
class and by brand-generic status are in accordance with the published literature, it still is
possible that unobserved characteristics may confound our findings. Second, Premera is a
health plan and the ICER estimates are largely drawn from the health plan perspective instead
of a societal perspective. Hence, this policy may optimize insurance based on the payer
perspective ignoring costs and benefits accrued to care givers and other spillovers and therefore
the elasticity estimates may not necessarily generalize to a social insurance plan. Practically, the
availability of cost-effectiveness evidence from a true societal perspective is limited. Third,
practical limitations of pharmacy claims adjudication systems result in imprecision in matching
value to copayments. Typically, the clinical indication for a medication is unknown to the health
plan (or pharmacy claims adjudicator) at the time of fill. Therefore the health plan assigns the
same copayment to a medication regardless of indication. However, ICER estimates may vary
across indications for a single medication. Practically, the VBF assigns medications to
19

copayment tiers based on the ICER estimate for the indication with the highest prescription
volume. This imprecision does not bias our mean elasticity estimates (since the analysis was
performed at the medication level) but does impact the welfare change estimates. More precise
matching of value to copayments is expected to increase the estimated effect of the VBF on
welfare loss reduction. Finally, the study population is comprised of employees and dependents
of a health insurance firm. To the extent that these individuals are better informed about the
marginal benefits of treatment and are better aligned to their optimal therapy, they are less
likely to reduce utilization. Alternately, it is also possible that this population may be more
aware of changes in insurance benefits and this may make them more price sensitive.
Our work suggests that by changing copayments bidirectionally, the substitution effect may
be used to either amplify or dampen medication utilization. This in turn may be used to optimize
welfare loss changes. Drug-specific overall elasticities that we estimated could be used to
forecast welfare effects of alternative cost-effectiveness thresholds. We hope that our results
presented in this paper presents a more clear picture of the effects of VBF designs on welfare
and provide a more intuitive description of price elasticities obtained through such natural
experiments.
