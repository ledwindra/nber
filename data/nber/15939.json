    "abstract": "\n\n\u201cNudges\u201d are being widely promoted to encourage energy conservation.  We show that the popular electricity conservation \u201cnudge\u201d of providing feedback to households on own and peers\u2019 home electricity usage in a home electricity report is two to four times more effective with political liberals than with conservatives.    Political conservatives are more likely than liberals to opt out of receiving the home electricity report and to report disliking the report.  Our results suggest that energy conservation nudges need to be targeted to be most effective.\n\n",
