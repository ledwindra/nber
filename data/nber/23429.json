    "abstract": "\n\nHere's why. (1) The HP filter produces series with spurious dynamic relations that have no basis in the underlying data-generating process.  (2) Filtered values at the end of the sample are very different from those in the middle, and are also characterized by spurious dynamics. (3) A statistical formalization of the problem typically produces values for the smoothing parameter vastly at odds with common practice, e.g., a value for \u03bb far below 1600 for quarterly data.  (4) There's a better alternative. A regression of the variable at date t+h on the four most recent values as of date t offers a robust approach to detrending that achieves all the objectives sought by users of the HP filter with none of its drawbacks.\n\n",
