On the Return to Venture Capital
Boyan Jovanovic and Balàzs Szentes
NBER Working Paper No. 12874
January 2007, Revised September 2007
JEL No. G24,L26
ABSTRACT
We provide a model that links the high return to venture equity to the impatience of the VCs. VCs
are scarce, and hence, they have market power and a high return on their investments. As a result,
VCs are eager to terminate non-performing ventures so they can move on to new ones. The scarcity
of VCs enables them to internalize their social value, and the competitive equilibrium is socially optimal.
We estimate the model and back out the return of solo entrepreneurs which is always below that of
the return of VCs.

Introduction

This paper builds and estimates a model that explains several facts:
1. Venture investments yield returns several points above what their risk characteristics would warrant. Cochrane (2005) estimates Alpha at over 30 percent,
Ljungqvist and Richardson find it to be at least five percent, Kaplan and Schoar
(2005) argue that it may well be four or five percent, and Hall and Woodward
(2007) estimate it at around two percent.4
2. Founders are more attached to and more patient with their projects than VCs
who, according to Sahlman (1990), Wright and Robbie (1998) and Jones and
Rhodes-Kropf (2004), behave as if their discount rates were as high as 30 to 50
percent,
3. VC-backed companies are worth more at IPO (Megginson and Weiss 1991,
Hochberg 2004),
4. The survival of VC-backed companies is not any higher than that of solo ventures (Manigart, Baeyens, and Van Hyfte 2002, Goldfarb, Kirsch, and Miller
2006)
Our model explains these facts in the following way:
1. VCs and, hence, operating VC funds are scarce compared to the number of
proposals they see; this raises the rents that VC funds get from the projects
that they finance, and raises the quality of projects that they accept. We do
not explain why VCs are scarce, we only trace the consequences of that scarcity
for the variables of interest.
2. Because the VC can always move on to a new company, looking after a nonperforming company entails for him a foregone-earnings cost that a founder
does not face, and this makes the VC less patient.
3. The impatient VC imposes a higher quality hurdle than the founder does, and
this selection eﬀect raises the IPO values of VC-backed firms above those of
other firms.
4. The VC has a deeper pocket than the founder, but he is less patient. The net
eﬀect on terminations is ambiguous.
4

If the U.K. betas on venture are in the same ballpark as U.S. betas — say around the 1.7 percent
that Hall and Woodward (2007) estimate — then the U.K. Alpha on Venture is even higher than
the U.S. alpha. Writing in the early 90s (i.e, before the really high market returns of the late 90s
which would, in the usual calculations imply a higher required rate of return) Bygrave (1994) says
that “...VC returns have most often been in the teens, with occasional periods in the 20-30 per cent
range and rare spikes above 30 per cent.

2

The main actors in the model are VCs5 who have unlimited wealth, and entrepreneurs who are endowed with limited wealth and with projects. A project entails
start-up and continuation costs. The start-up cost must be paid before any information about the project’s quality can come in. After that, continuation costs must
be paid until the project succeeds or is terminated. Start-up costs entail only capital, but continuation costs entail capital and eﬀort: funds must be supplied and the
entrepreneur must exert eﬀort without interruption until the project yields fruit.
Project quality has two dimensions: Payoﬀ size, and the waiting time until the
payoﬀ is realized. Neither dimension is known before a contract between a VC and
entrepreneur is signed, after which the payoﬀ is learned, but not the waiting time.
Either party can, at any time, terminate the project. The entrepreneur can do so
by withholding eﬀort, the VC by withholding capital. The optimal contract is set
up so that when a project is terminated, both are better oﬀ: The entrepreneur no
longer wishes to exert eﬀort, and the VC no longer wishes to lend. The VC is in
the model a supplier of capital and is also able to recognize project quality in a way
that banks cannot (in reality a good VC must have a hybrid of skills; he must be
able to evaluate technology, demand, and managerial talent). Thus the VC does not
add value to the project directly. We shall show that our model is consistent with
Sørensen (forthcoming) who finds that the bulk of the observed positive association
between VC quality and project quality is due not to direct VC influence on the
payoﬀ, but to sorting.
Because entrepreneurs have some wealth, some will opt to run their projects alone,
“solo”. Bank lending is unprofitable because banks lack the expertise of the VCs in
assessing project quality. A solo entrepreneur may run out of money before the
optimal termination date, which forces a poor entrepreneur to use VC funding or
abandon her project.
The outcome is eﬃcient for a wide range of parameter values. Eﬃciency pertains
to both (i) contracting between VCs and entrepreneurs and the resulting termination
rules, and to (ii) entrepreneurs’ choices over whether to seek VC backing, whether to
develop the project on their own, or whether to abandon the project altogether.
We fit a seven-parameter version of the model to panel data on 1355 firms from the
1980s and ’90s, and display the results in a series of graphs. The model matches reality
along several dimensions, such as the project-success hazard, the project-termination
hazard, equity shares, and up-front investment costs. The fit is remarkable given the
number of parameters is less than the number of variables fitted. The model emphasizes the behavior of real variables: Project duration, project value and age-related
rate of return, rate of termination, and the equity share of the VC and entrepreneur.
We only predict the equity shares, and not the finer features of contracts such as
the use of convertible debt. In this stylized setting, the focus is on whether we see
5

We do not analyze how the rents that the VC funds earn are divided of rents among the general
partners and the limited partners of a VC fund. Our paper is not about the division of these rents.
In fact, the VC in our model should be thought of as the general and limited partners together.

3

rather debt or rather equity contracts. The result is that only equity can give the
right incentives to both parties at the margin.
Venture capital is now exported to other countries, but there are significant barriers to its flow, even within the U.S.. The model therefore has meaningful crosseconomy implications. The model says that places where venture capital is scarcer
should not have appreciably diﬀerent contractual forms as long as the nature of the
projects is the same. For a wide range of distributions of project quality and of
wealth (the latter aﬀects an entrepreneur’s ability to self finance and to bypass VCs)
and for a wide range of VC supply, the observed contracts should be the same. Any
diﬀerences in contracts that did arise should show up in just two dimensions: The
share of up-front costs that the VC finances, and the VC’s share in the equity of the
project.
Notes on the literature.–Bergemann and Hege (2005), deal with a single VC and
a single entrepreneur, with their outside options taken as given. Holmes and Schmitz
(1990) analyze a market equilibrium and determine the rewards of founders relative
to managers of firms, but do not model venture capital. Inderst and Muller (2004)
model the market for venture capital as do Michelacci and Suarez (2004) who, in
addition, analyze the termination decision and link it to the equilibrium value of
a VC, but who do not look at data. Ueda (2004) analyzes the mode-of-financing
decision in a model where one cost of VC financing is the threat that the VC use the
information to set up a competing business. Cochrane (2005) deals with the valuing
the income streams to VC portfolios but does not derive optimal termination rules.
We discuss some of these papers and others further in the body of the paper.
Plan of the paper.–The next section describes the model, and Section 3 derives
the equilibrium contract and shows that the competitive outcome is eﬃcient. Section
4 derives several empirical implications of the model and discusses evidence. Section
5 solves an example by hand and fits it to longitudinal data on VC investments,
spanning 1989-2000, and their performance outcomes. Section 6 concludes the paper
and the Appendix describes the data and the estimation procedure.

Model

There is a measure x of infinitely lived VCs, each able to raise a suﬃcient amount of
money at the rate r. There is also an inflow at the rate λ of potential projects, each
in the possession of a diﬀerent entrepreneur. The entrepreneurs cannot borrow, and
have initial wealth w which is distributed according to the C.D.F. Ψ. An entrepreneur
can have at most one project, ever.
A Project
For a project to succeed, it requires an immediate payment of a cost C, and after
that it also requires k units of investment and a units of eﬀort by E at every instant
up until the project yields a payoﬀ. A project can be undertaken by an entrepreneur
4

(E) alone, in which case she must rely on her own wealth only, or together with a
VC. The project yields a payoﬀ π at time τ , where π and τ are random variables
independent of each other. Let G be the C.D.F. of π, and g its density. Let F be
the C.D.F. of τ , and f its density. Both G and F are supported on R+ . Assume
that the hazard rate f / (1 − F ) = h is bell shaped: It first increases up to the modal
age, τ m ,, then decreases. In other words, as time passes without realization of τ , the
agents first become more optimistic about a quick realization of τ , then increasingly
pessimistic.6
If the project is either not invested into or eﬀort is not exerted, the project cannot
yield a positive payoﬀ, ever. Neither party knows π and τ , but their distributions
are common knowledge. In a VC-backed firm, after the contract is signed and after
E incurs C, π becomes known to both parties. However, no information about τ is
received. In a solo venture, E alone incurs C at the outset, and thereby she learns π.
The expected social value to developing projects is assumed to be positive. That
is, if financing decisions regarding the project are made optimally, it yields a positive
payoﬀ in expectation.
Preferences
All agents are risk neutral and discount the future at the rate r. Utility is additively separable in consumption and leisure. The VC maximizes the expected discounted present value of his net income. The entrepreneur maximizes the expected
discounted present value of her income minus the stream of her exerted eﬀorts.
Market Structure
When E gets an idea, she has to decide whether to abandon her project, to seek
VC-backing, or to go solo, i.e., to implement her project alone. This decision is
irreversible.
Suppose that at time t there is a measure n of VCs who is not in a contractual
relationship with entrepreneurs and a measure of m of entrepreneurs who wishes to
be financed by a VC. Then the number min {n, m} of VCs and entrepreneurs are
randomly matched and can enter into a contract.
Timing
Events occur in the following sequence:
1. Entrepreneur chooses whether to (i) abandon her project, (ii) develop her
project on her own, or (iii) sign a contract with a VC,
2. Under option (ii) or (iii) , C is incurred immediately,
6

Jeremy Stein suggested the name “waiting-at-the-altar” hazard: The bride is unlikely to show
up early, and the chances of her showing up rise at first. But after a certain point it starts to look
like the bride will not show up at all. Our results would follow more easily if the hazard were to
decline monotonically throughout. The bell-shape assumption conforms better to facts.

5

3. π is then revealed.
Contracting
Feasible Contracts.–The contract the VC can oﬀer consists of two positive numbers: (p, s). The number p is a lump sum the VC pays E right after signing a contract.
In that case E bears only C − p of the up-front cost. The number s specifies how
to share the payoﬀ if the project succeeds. If the project yields payoﬀ π, E gets
sπ and the VC gets (1 − s) π. Neither E’s eﬀort nor the VC’s subsequent investment are contractible. On the other hand the payments p and the sharing rule s are
enforceable.
After the transfer p, this is a pure equity contract. We could allow for more
complicated contracts in which s would depend on τ and π. We shall show, however,
that these simple contracts already induce socially eﬃcient decisions. Moreover, the
equilibrium outcome of a game with more complicated contracts would be identical
to ours.
Timing of the Contractual Relationship –First, the VC oﬀers a contract, (p, s) ,
to E. If E refuses the contract the game between these two parties ends; E then has to
abandon the project, whereas the VC seeks to be matched with another entrepreneur.
If E signs the contract she receives p from the VC up front. We interpret p as
the amount that the VC pays towards financing C. The entrepreneur finances the
remaining part of C and both parties then immediately learn the value of π.
At each date, if the payoﬀ has not yet been realized, E has to decide whether to
exert eﬀort and the VC has to decide whether to invest. One can assume that the
parties can observe the history of investments and eﬀort up to time t, when making
these decisions.7 If the VC decides not to invest into the project, he is free to devote
his time to another project. If E decides not to exert eﬀort anymore, she leaves the
market.
If the project yields a payoﬀ π at time t, E gets sπ the VC gets (1 − s) π and the
game ends between the two parties. Again, the VC seeks a new match, and E leaves
the market.
Banks
In our model, banks guarantee a risk-free interest rate, but they do not finance
projects. This is because VCs are assumed to have two advantages over banks. First,
banks lack the expertise of the VCs and entrepreneurs; banks can learn π only at
the date of success, τ , not before. Second, banks also lack the monitoring ability of
the VCs which ensures that Es do not divert investment to private consumption. As
a result, banks do not oﬀer contracts to entrepreneurs, for otherwise anybody could
7

So as to avoid coordination problems, we assume that at time t the VC observes the history
of eﬀorts on the interval [0, t) and that the entrepreneur observes the history of investments on the
interval [0, t]. Our equilibrium remains an equilibrium even if neither party observes whether the
other is supporting the project.

pretend to be an E and divert the borrowed funds for personal use, so that banks
would make negative profits.

Analysis

First, we characterize the socially optimal outcome of our economy. Then we show
that this outcome is the unique outcome in the competitive market conditional on
some distributional assumption on the wealth of Es.

3.1

Socially Optimal Decisions

We proceed as follows. First, we analyze the optimal decision regarding how long a
project should be supported. This decision depends on whether the project is VC
backed or supported by a solo entrepreneur. Second, we characterize the socially
optimal decision whether E should go solo, seek VC backing, or abandon her project.
3.1.1

The termination problem and the social value of a VC

The VC faces no budget constraint, that is, he is able to finance a project at any
moment of time no matter what the payoﬀs of previously supported projects were. He
can, however, handle only one project at a time. The social value of a VC is positive
because he is able to support projects that otherwise would not be implemented.
The Social Value of a VC.–In what follows, we assume that VCs finance only
those entrepreneurs who would otherwise abandon their projects. (Later this becomes
a result.) Denote the social value of a free VC by W . A free VC immediately matches
with an E, the cost C is incurred, and π is revealed. Then the planner decides how long
to support the project if it does not yield fruit, T (π). As soon as the project succeeds
or is terminated, the VC becomes free and generates a value of W as of then. Hence,
the social value of the VC can be expressed as the sum of the discounted expected
payoﬀ from a project and the discounted continuation value he generates after he is
again free8 :

Let us explain the RHS of (1). First the benefit: Suppose that π is revealed after C is
sunk and that the planner supports the project up to time T . The expected benefit
from this project is

(π + W ) e−rt f (t) dt + e−rT (1 − F [T ]) W ,

This equation has a unique solution for W . This is because the RHS is positive at W = 0 since
the social value of the project is positive, and its slope is less than one by the Envelope Theorem.

because it yields π at time t with likelihood f (t) if t ≤ T , in which case the benefit
is π + W . If the project does not succeed until time T it is then terminated with
probability (1 − F [T ]) and its only benefit then is W . Second, the cost: What
measure of projects will require investment at time t? If t > T then the project
surely exited already and no investment is made. If t ≤ T then a proportion F (t)
of the projects succeeded, and therefore only a measure of 1 − F (t) of them need
investment. Total cost then is

The LHS of (3) is the cost of waiting another instance: The physical cost, a + k, and
the opportunity cost, rW . The RHS is the expected benefit. The local second-order
condition is h0 (T ∗ (π)) < 0. Since h is bell shaped, this condition is also suﬃcient, as
Figure 1 shows.

The solo entrepreneur’s termination problem

A solo entrepreneur may run out of money and have to terminate her project. Consider an E with wealth w. Since utility is linear in consumption, E will optimally
defer all her consumption until the project is completed.9 Let wt denote E’s wealth
at time t given that her project did not succeed up to time t. Then wt is defined by
the diﬀerential equation ẇt = rwt − k. The initial condition is w0 = w − C because C
must be incurred immediately. In addition, at each instance of time, E has to invest
k and receives interest on her remaining wealth. The solution for wt is

The unconstrained entrepreneur.–Suppose first that w ≥ k/r + C, that is, E
has enough money to finance her project forever. Since new ideas occur only to
new entrepreneurs, if she terminates the project prior to success E gets zero as her
terminal payoﬀ. Therefore, she solves the following maximization problem:

it is zero. Let π E

3.1.3

The Socially Optimal Financing Mode

The expected surplus, after incurring the cost C, of a solo entrepreneur with wealth
w is
Z
E
Q (w) = q (π, w) dG (π) .
The next lemma characterizes some important features of the curve QE .

Lemma 1 (i) For w < k/r + C, ∂QE /∂w > 0. (ii) For w ≥
and QE (w) > C.

k
r

+ C, ∂QE /∂w = 0

The intuition behind statement (i) of this lemma is the following. A budgetconstrained entrepreneur can use an additional dollar to prolong the time of supporting her project, instead of using it to consume. Since sometimes it is socially eﬃcient
to finance the project longer than the budget-constrained entrepreneur can aﬀord,
she can generate a positive surplus.
An entrepreneur with w > k/r + C can already support her project as long as it is
socially optimal. She would invest her additional dollar at the rate r. This additional
dollar does not generate excess return over the interest rate of a bank, explaining why
the slope of QE is zero in this region. Since the expected social value of a project is
positive by assumption, QE (w) > C whenever w > k/r + C. This explains part (ii)
of the lemma.
Going solo or abandoning the project. –Suppose, first, that VC backing was not
an option. The payoﬀ to going solo with wealth w is w − C + QE (w). We now
explain why this payoﬀ must look as drawn in Figure 2. It is not defined for w < C

because E cannot pay C. At w = C, it is zero because after paying C, E has no
money left to invest in the project. Thereafter, by part (i) of Lemma 1, the slope
exceeds unity. As w reaches k/r + C, w − C + QE (w) reaches w + σ, where σ > 0
because QE (k/r + C) > C by part (ii) of Lemma 1. The payoﬀ is continuous in
w, hence from the Intermediate Value Theorem it follows that there exists a value
of wealth, denoted by w∗ , were the payoﬀ curve intersects with the 450 line, that is,
QE (w∗ ) = C. Moreover, at any intersection, the slope of w − C + QE (w) is strictly
larger than unity, and therefore the intersection, w∗ , is unique. The entrepreneur
with wealth w∗ is indiﬀerent between going solo and abandoning the project.
Who should get VC-backing? –We shall assume that there are many poor entrepreneurs, with wealth below w∗ who, in the absence of VCs, would abandon their
projects. Then, it is socially optimal for VCs to back only entrepreneurs that have
wealth less than w∗ . The average duration of a VC-backed project is
Z Z ∞
t̄ =
min (t, T ∗ [π]) f (t) dtdG (π) .
0

At any point in time, the rate at which free VCs flow in is x/t̄. The inflow of
entrepreneurs is λ and, of these, a measure λΨ (w∗ ) would abandon their projects
unless they could turn to a VC. When VCs are suﬃciently scarce in the sense that
x
< λΨ (w∗ ) ,
t̄
we have the following result:
11

(9)

Proposition 1 If (9) holds, the socially optimal outcome is described as follows:
(i) An entrepreneur with initial wealth w > w∗ goes solo. A measure of x/t̄
entrepreneurs gets VC-backing at every instance of time, each of them with wealth
less than w∗ . The rest abandon their projects.
(ii) The termination of a VC-backed project is determined by (4), and that of the
solo project by (8).

3.2

The Competitive Outcome

We now derive conditions under which the social optimum is a competitive equilibrium.
For the VC to take socially optimal decisions, his market value must, as we shall
show, coincide with his social value. But this can happen only if VCs can extract all
the surplus from projects. They will have such market power if they support only
projects that would otherwise be abandoned. The latter, in turn, arises if there are
more poor entrepreneurs than there are free VCs.
But this is not the whole story. Since investment and eﬀort are not contractible,
the VCs must be able to provide contracts to Es that induce socially eﬃcient termination by both parties while, at the same time, transferring all the surplus to the
VC. We shall show that such contracts exist.
The Equilibrium Contract.–Recall that a contract consists of two numbers (p, s),
where p is paid by the VC to E before π is realized, and s is the sharing rule upon
the realization of π. We shall show that if the sharing rule is
s∗ =

a
,
a + k + rW

(10)

the termination rules of both parties are indeed socially optimal.
But how can the VC extract the whole surplus from the entrepreneur? The VC
enjoys all the rents if and only if the entrepreneur enjoys none. The entrepreneur’s
payoﬀ from the contract (p, s∗ ) conditional on both parties supporting the project up
to T ∗ (π) is

Moreover, once terminated by a VC, the entrepreneur would not wish to continue
the project alone (either through self finance or bank finance) because the VC retains
his equity in the project even after ceasing to invest in it. Thus the entrepreneur’s

Figure 3: The equilibrium allocation of entrepreneurs to activities
reward would not rise, but her costs would, and so she would strictly prefer to stop
right away.
The selection of entrepreneurs into activities.–Entrepreneurs’ choices of the mode
of investment are described in Figure 3. If p∗ < C, the VC does not pay the entire fixed
cost. The entrepreneur must pay C − p∗ up front, and some potential entrepreneurs
will have wealth insuﬃcient to cover this amount. These are people with wealth
below C − p∗ in Figure 3. The fraction of entrepreneurs that wish to get VC backing
is Ψ (w∗ ). But the fraction that can also aﬀord to pay the cost of C − p is just
Ψ (w∗ ) − Ψ (C − p). This is the area “Abandon or VC” in Figure 3. Hence the
distributional assumption we need is
Ψ (w∗ ) − Ψ (C − p∗ ) >

If the previous inequality holds, then (i) there are enough poor entrepreneurs who
prefer to go with a VC and, (ii) among these there are enough who have enough
wealth to finance their share of C. Notice that (12) requires w∗ to be larger than
C − p∗ . In addition, in order to interpret p∗ as the part of the cost C paid by the
VC, we need p∗ > 0. Both of these inequalities turn out to be true as we prove in the
following

Theorem 1 (The Welfare Theorem) If (12) holds, the socially optimal outcome
coincides with the unique competitive equilibrium outcome in which the allocations
are supported by the following strategies:
(i) A VC always oﬀers the contract (p∗ , s∗ ) given by (10) and (11). If the contract
is accepted, he follows the socially optimal decisions, defined by (4).
(ii) An entrepreneur with wealth w ≥ w∗ goes solo and follows the socially optimal
termination rule defined by (8).
(iii) An entrepreneur with wealth w ∈ (p∗ , w∗ ) seeks VC-backing with probability x/ (t̄λ [Ψ (w∗ ) − Ψ (C − p∗ )]) and abandons her project otherwise. Entrepreneurs
seeking VC backing accept the contract oﬀered by the VC, and follow the socially
optimal decisions defined by (4).
(iv) An entrepreneur with wealth w ≤ C − p∗ abandons her project.
The equilibrium is further described in Figure 4. In the figure, as p varies, s is
held fixed at s∗ . The vertical axis measures the up-front cost to E. The Figure shows
the following:
1. If there were no VCs, Ψ (w∗ ) entrepreneurs would abandon their projects, and
the remaining 1 − Ψ (w∗ ) would go solo as shown in Figures 2 and 3.
2. Since abandoning her project oﬀers E zero rents, Es’ demand for VCs is infinitely
elastic at C − p∗ up to the point Ψ (w∗ ) − Ψ (C − p∗ ) (The poorest Ψ (C − p∗ )
entrepreneurs cannot aﬀord the up-front cost).
14

3. As p rises above p∗ some of Es that would otherwise go solo would start switching
to VCs. In addition, some other Es, who had insuﬃcient liquidity to pay their
part of the fixed cost earlier, can now aﬀord to contract with VCs instead of
abandoning their projects.

3.3

Proof of the Welfare Theorem

First, we prove that given the decision about the financing mode, Es’ as well as the
VCs’ decisions regarding the termination time of a project are indeed socially optimal.
That is, we prove the second parts of claims (i), (ii), and (iii) of Theorem 1. If E
decides to go solo, then she is the one who incurs all the costs related to the project,
but she also enjoys all the potential benefits. In other words, her costs and benefits
are identical to the social costs and benefits, hence she follows the socially optimal
decision rules described by (8). Therefore, we only have to show these claims for
VC-backed projects.
Second, we show that given the termination times, the decisions regarding the
financing mode are as described in the first parts of claims (ii), (iii), and (iv) of the
theorem.
Since the VC extracts all the surplus, he has no incentive to oﬀer a diﬀerent
contract. For the same reason, Es with w ∈ [C − p∗ , w∗ ] are indiﬀerent between the
three options.
Incentive Compatibility and Optimality of the Contract (p∗ , s∗ )
We now analyze the incentives of the agents to support the project after a contract
(p, s) is signed and both parties learn the value of π.
Entrepreneur.–If E trusts that the project is always financed by the VC, and that
she will get s∗ π if the project is successful, she solves the following problem:
¶

If the solution, T E (π), is interior it is defined by the corresponding first-order condition:

The
¡ local ¢second-order condition, which is also is also the suﬃcient condition, is again
h0 T E [π] < 0. Finally, if π is below a cutoﬀ, denoted by π E
c , she does not start to
exert eﬀort.
VC.–In equilibrium, the market value of a free VC is just W . If VC trusts that
E will always support the project, and that he, VC, gets (1 − s∗ ) π if the project
succeeds, his maximization problem after signing the contract is
¶

The suﬃcient condition is again h0 T V C [π] < 0. If π is lower than a cutoﬀ, denoted
by π Vc C , the VC does not invest in the project.

First, suppose that

the solutions for both (14) and (16) are interior. Equations (15) and (17) define the

But this requires that

which is exactly the definition of s∗ . It remains to show that the solution to (14) is
interior if and only if the solution to (16) is interior. That is, the cutoﬀs, under which
agents refuse to support the project, are the same for E and the VC. We show more:
we prove in Appendix A that both cutoﬀs coincide with the socially optimal cutoﬀ,
π min .

Optimality.–We argue that the termination decisions described above are the
socially optimal ones. First of all, by Lemma 3, those projects which are socially
eﬃcient to abandon right after paying C are also abandoned in equilibrium. Second,
from (4) the socially optimal termination decision, T ∗ (π), regarding a project which
is worth starting to support, satisfies h (T ∗ (π)) = (a + k + rW ) /π. Hence, in order
to prove eﬃciency of the rule (15) (or equivalently (17)), we need that
a
s∗ π

=

a + k + rW
,
π

which is satisfied by (18).
The Choice of Financing Mode of an Entrepreneur
We now show the first parts of claims (ii), (iii), and (iv) of Theorem 1.
Suppose first, that E has initial wealth w ≤ C − p∗ . Then, she cannot contract
with a VC, because she cannot finance C − p∗ up-front. By Lemma 2 w < w∗ , hence
she is better oﬀ abandoning than going solo.
Suppose that w ∈ (C − p∗ , w∗ ). Since w < w∗ , E is still better oﬀ abandoning
than going solo. However, she has enough wealth to finance C − p∗ of the fixed
16

cost. Since the VCs extract all the surplus from the projects, these Es are indiﬀerent
between seeking VC-backing and abandoning. So they can randomize according to
claim (iii) of Theorem 1.
If w > w∗ , E goes solo, since her payoﬀ, w − C + QE (w), is larger than w, and
her other options all provide her with a payoﬀ of w.
Uniqueness of the competitive equilibrium actions.–The project-acceptance and
termination decisions are uniquely determined, as is the equilibrium contract (p∗ , s∗ ).
The proof of uniqueness goes as follows. In any equilibrium, the VC-backed entrepreneurs do not enjoy any rent. Furthermore, at the equilibrium stopping time, both
parties are indiﬀerent between supporting and abandoning the project. These two
observations imply that the Bellman equation defining the market value of a VC is
identical to (1). Since (1) had a unique solution, the market value of a VC is also
uniquely determined, and equals his social value. If the VC were to oﬀer any other
contract it would have to attain this value W and implement the actions (π min , T ∗ ).

3.4

Discussion of the Welfare Theorem

There are two reasons why here the validity of the First Welfare Theorem might
seem surprising. First, agency problems could arise, since neither VC investment
nor E’s eﬀort is contractible. Second, agents are not price-takers — VCs are strategic
when oﬀering contracts. Next, we explain why the competitive equilibrium is eﬃcient
despite of these problems.
Discussion of the Equilibrium Contract
We emphasize that the validity of the Welfare Theorem in our model is due to
the existence of institutions and not a natural feature of the world. More precisely, it
is the contractibility of the profit sharing rule that makes it possible for both E and
the VC to make socially optimal decisions.
Intuition for the equilibrium contract.–The VC and E must be given the incentive to both support the project exactly up to T ∗ (π). The equity s∗ in (10) provides
both the right incentives because the marginal cost of a VC-backed project is shared
correctly between the VC and E. The VC invests k and incurs an opportunity cost
of rW , while E exerts eﬀort a. Then E cares only about her own cost, a, and not
the social cost a + k + rW . However, if s = a/ (a + k + rW ), then E’s benefit is
[a/ (a + k + rW )] π, instead of the social benefit π. This means that the objective
function of E is the objective function of the social planner down-scaled by the constant a/ (a + k + rW ). Similarly, the objective function of the VC is down-scaled by
(k + rW ) / (a + k + rW ). Scaling does not aﬀect decisions, however, and the VC and
E both choose the same T as the planner would. Therefore, our model explains why
we observe equity contracts between VCs and Es, and not, e.g., debt-contracts.
Debt contracts.–If the VC and E signed a debt contract, E would have to incur
the total cost of a project on the margin. But if, as we assume, E would have to
repay that debt from the project’s payoﬀ, π, her marginal benefit from a succeeding
17

project would be less than π, i.e., strictly less than the social marginal benefit. This
would induce E to terminate the project too early. Thus, debt contracts would induce
ineﬃcient terminations.
Labor contracts.–If eﬀort were observable, the VC could hire E as a worker and
induce the eﬃcient outcome. If E were to receive a wage of a at each instant, she
would be exactly compensated for her eﬀort, and would hence be willing to accept
such a contract. The VC would then internalize the social costs and benefits of the
project, and both parties would make socially optimal decisions. Such a contract,
however, is not robust to the observability of E’s eﬀort. Had the VC not been able to
observe E’s eﬀort, E would strictly prefer to shirk for two reasons. First, if she shirked,
she would not incur the disutility of working. Second, by shirking she would prevent
the project from succeeding, and would thereby prolong the time during which she
received the wage. In our equilibrium, on the other hand, the observability of the
eﬀort (and even the observability of the project still being alive) plays absolutely no
role because s∗ gives E and the VC exactly the right incentive to support the project.
Discussion of the VC’s market value
In order to achieve eﬃciency, the social value of a VC must coincide with his
market value. Condition (12) contains two assumptions: (A) There must be fewer
VCs than there are Es that seek VC-backing, and (B) Among these Es there must be
suﬃciently many that can aﬀord to pay C − p∗ up-front. (A) is crucial to our result,
for it provides the VCs with market power and with the ability to oﬀer contracts
that enable them to extract the full surplus from a project. That is why the market
value and the social value of a free VC are the same. But (B) is less important
and can be easily relaxed by introducing more complicated contracts. The VCs could
extract surplus from more liquidity constrained entrepreneurs if the sharing rule s was
increasing over time. Recall that we have restricted attention to time-independent
sharing rules, and hence the entrepreneur was only indiﬀerent between exerting eﬀort
and shirking at the time of termination, but strictly preferred to exert eﬀort anytime
before. If s was allowed to change over time, the entrepreneur could have been
made indiﬀerent between working and shirking at times before the termination of
the project, and by such contracts surplus could have been extracted from poorer
entrepreneurs without violating incentive constraints.
In the search-matching models of Inderst and Muller (2004) and Michelacci and
Suarez (2004), Nash bargaining divides the rents between the VC and E. The “Hosios
condition” (which states that factor shares in the constant-returns-to-scale matching
function should equal the factors’ relative bargaining strength) must hold for the
equilibrium to be eﬃcient. It is pure coincidence if that equality should obtain,
and so generically these models imply ineﬃciency of equilibria — policies that change
incentives for entry by one side or the other can generally improve the sum of the
payoﬀs. In our model, by contrast, eﬃciency holds on an open set of all parameter
values; since w∗ , p∗ , and t̄ are continuous in the parameters of the model, condition
(12) holds for a large range of parameters. It is true that our model takes the relative
18

numbers of Es and VCs as exogenous. Since VCs get the full social value of their
capital, if we endogenized venture capital we would expect that an optimal amount
of it would be created.
Bergemann and Hege (2005, henceforth BH) argue that dynamic contracts between Es and VCs are ineﬃcient relative to first best. In their model the project
succeeds with some probability in each period, and the payoﬀ is proportional to the
invested funds. As in our setup, as time passes without success, agents become more
and more pessimistic but, in contrast to our model, E can divert the invested funds to
private consumption (with or) without the VC observing it. The authors show that
the project is supported for a time that is shorter than would be socially eﬃcient, and
it gets less funds. The explanation is that in order to provide E with proper incentives,
the optimal contract must specify a decreasing stream of investment funds. While in
BH incentives cause early and ineﬃcient terminations of VC-backed projects, in our
model the VC’s high opportunity cost result in early, yet eﬃcient, terminations. In
any case, it would seem that the closeness of VC oversight makes it hard for E to
divert funds to consumption.

Empirical implications

This section discusses some qualitative implications and assumptions of the model
and compares them with evidence.
1. The market power of the VC.–(12) implies that in Figure 4 the supply of VCs
is to the left of the kink in the demand curve. Small shifts in supply should leave
the equilibrium return to venture capital unchanged. In support of this, Kaplan and
Schoar (2005, Table 13) find that the entry of new funds does not significantly reduce
returns on venture funds. But a small shift in the supply of VCs should also not
aﬀect the terms of the contracts, their duration, or the total amount invested, and
here the evidence is less favorable: Gompers and Lerner (2000) find that outward
shifts in the supply of venture capital act to raise the total amount that VCs pay
into the companies they oversee, and Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (forthcoming)
find that the likelihood of getting to IPO rises after a positive shock to the supply of
funds.
2. The excess rate of return to VCs and Es.–Having estimated the model’s
parameters exclusively from the data on VC-backed projects, we can calculate the
excess return that solo Es earn on their investments. This excess return depends on
E’s wealth. Figure 5 is based on our estimated model in which E’s excess return
which never reaches that of the VC. At w∗ , E is indiﬀerent between going solo and
abandoning the project, hence there her excess return is zero. It then rises with E’s
level of wealth, becoming flat when w = C + k/r, i.e., the point where the solo E
ceases to be liquidity constrained in any state of the world, i.e., for any realization of
π. The formulas are in the Appendix. The second panel of Figure 5 is the estimated

Figure 5: The excess return of solo entrepreneurs
analog of Figure 2. At $28 million, w∗ is quite large. This estimate comes about
because we estimate C to be $6.4 million. In our model a solo E expects to earn
at least the market rate, and therefore she cannot have a negative alpha. There
is evidence of negative alphas for some Es (Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen 2002)
and independent inventors (Astebro 2003), and further work should reveal what may
explain such patterns. Recently, however, Hopenhayn and Vereshchagina (2004) and
Miao and Wang (2005) have argued that when one factors in the option value of the
project, the alphas are nonnegative. This exercise should be qualified by noting that
the types of ventures that VCs fund are high-tech and require more funding than the
average small business.
3. Terminations.–VCs are less patient with their projects than rich Es, and
therefore are more likely to terminate a non-performing venture. We cannot rank
terminations of VC-backed firms and those of poor Es because on the one hand, the
VC is less patient, but on the other, the poor entrepreneur may run out of money.
This may explain why Manigart et al. (2002) and Goldfarb et al. (2006) find no
significant diﬀerence between the failure hazards in the two populations. In contrast,
Ber and Yafeh (2004) find that the probability of survival until the IPO stage is higher
for VC-backed companies. Nevertheless, based on Figure 6, we know that VC-backed
firms must have higher termination hazards initially.
4. Value at IPO.–Hochberg (2004) finds that the stock-market value of IPO is
higher when a VC is present, and Megginson and Weiss (1991, Table III) find this to
be true even when one controls for book values. In our model, book value presumably
is C + tk, so that, given t, the book values of VC-backed and solo firms would be the
same.

Proposition 2

T V C (π) ≤ T E (π) .

(19)

The proof first shows that the VC is more selective at age zero than E, that is, his
cutoﬀ for starting to support a project is higher than that of a wealthy solo E:
VC
πE
min ≤ π min .

(20)

This is because the VC only starts supporting a project if it yields at least an expected
payoﬀ of W , while for a rich solo E it suﬃces that it yield a positive profit. The proof
then shows that the VC is more selective at all ages than the rich E, because —
while the marginal benefit of waiting is the same for a VC and E — for the VC the
marginal cost is higher by the amount rW. Figure 6 illustrates (20) about age-zero
terminations, and it portrays π E
min (w) for all w, the shape of which is based on the
following result, also proved in Appendix A:
Proposition 3 TwE (π) is increasing in w and constant on [C + k/r, ∞).
Therefore poor Es are also more selective than rich Es at age zero, and, according
to (8), equally selective afterwards, as long as their funds last. Therefore expected
market-book ratios of VC-backed firms exceed those for rich Es, but not necessarily
those of poor Es.
5. Age at IPO.–VC-backed IPOs should be stochastically younger, in the firstorder sense, than the rich-solo IPOs, but they can be stochastically older than the
IPOs of liquidity-constrained Es; the latter is true, roughly, if the liquidity constraint
bites earlier than the VC’s impatience constraint. The data on age of IPOs since firm
21

Figure 7: distribution of age (since founding) at IPO
founding on the NYSE and Nasdaq shown in Figure 7 turn out to be somewhere in
between — it excludes spinout and rollup (i.e., consolidation) IPOs in the plots, but
including them would not change the results.
6. Financing is staged and good projects receive more investment rounds.–The
VC infuses further capital at various points if and only if E has exerted eﬀort —
capital infusions are a part of an incentive contract to help elicit good behavior from
E. Moreover, the duration of investment depends on π. Gompers (1995) finds that
bad VC-backed projects are dropped and that good projects get more investment.
This happens in our model; the duration of investment rises with π: Projects with
π ≤ π min get no investment beyond C, and from (3),
¢
¡
h T V C [π]

because at the point of intersection h0 < 0. Since T ∗ = T V C M, this proves the claim
for the VC-backed projects, and diﬀerentiation in (8) establishes the same property
for TwE .

5

Adding random delay to the signal on π

The model says that all projects for which π ≤ π min are dropped at once. Our data
show that while some terminations do occur early, they don’t occur immediately.
This could be because it takes time to learn π and so we shall now introduce a delay
22

in receiving the signal about π. This extension does not aﬀect our theoretical results
and our welfare theorem still holds, but the modified model will fit the data better.
Suppose that a perfect signal on π arrives at date x, and that x has distribution
B and density b.
VC-backed projects.–If x = 0, the planner’s problem is the same as that in Section
C
3.1.1, and conditional on W, the solution, T ∗ , is again (4), with π Vmin
still being the
VC
cutoﬀ π. But for x > 0, the cutoﬀ is diﬀerent from π min for two reasons. First, the
costs incurred for t ∈ [0, x] are now sunk and, second, the waiting time to success is
now F (t | t > x) . Therefore the cutoﬀ, call it π min (x), is the largest value of π that
solves

The marginal condition for T is still (3), and so if x < T (π) and if π > π min (x), the
project is still terminated at time T ∗ (π). But if x ≥ T ∗ (π) or if π ≤ πmin (x), the
project is terminated at x, i.e., at once. To sum up: The optimal stopping time of a

Let T0 denote the age at which the planner terminates a project about which no

The LHS of (23) is the marginal cost of waiting. The RHS, the marginal benefit,
decomposes into two terms: First, the project might succeed in the next
instant; the
R
∗
likelihood of this event is h (T0 ) , and the expected payoﬀ is just πdG (π), since
no selection on π has yet occurred. Second, the signal on π may arrive in the next
instant; the likelihood of this event is δ (T0∗ ), and the project’s value changes from
VT0∗ (π, ∞) to VT0∗ (π, T0∗ ).
Solo Es.–A rich solo E solves the same problem as the one above, except W = 0
in all formulas. An E facing budget constraint again terminates either at the same
time as a rich solo E would, or when he runs out of money. This is true for x above
the mode of h. To the left of the mode, however, π min s depend on both x and w, and
they solve the analog of (21). We shall plot π min (x, w) in Appendix B.

Fitting data

Data description.–The data comprise VC investments in U.S. portfolio companies
founded between 1989 and 1993. Follow-on investments in these companies extend to
2001. The data are from the VentureXpert database provided by Thompson Venture
Economics. They follow 1745 companies. After dropping inconsistent, irrelevant, and
missing data, the final data cover $27 billion of venture capital investment in 1355
portfolio companies, of which 25% exited through an IPO, 19% were acquired, 32%
ceased to receive venture capital financing (terminated)10

We infer that a termination has occured 462 days after the last reported VC investment in a
terminal period of inactivity. Thus a ‘termination’ annot occur in the first year of a firm’s life and,
hence, the ‘zero’ in the first row of column 4. This termination criterion was imposed on this sample
in Guler (2003) and on its update in Guler (2007).

24

and 19% of companies in the sample were private companies still in the process
of receiving venture capital financing, and for them the possibility of an IPO or
acquisition was still deemed to exist as of 2001. The Table summarizes the data
focusing on the relation between the firm’s age in the first column, and the three
events that may befall the firm.
Estimated example.–We shall fit the following example to the data:

x ≥ 0 (25)

Thus π has a Pareto distribution, x has a constant hazard, δ, and τ has an increasing
density below τ m and a Pareto density above τ m . Thus we have eight parameters:
π 0 , λ, δ, ρ, τ m , C, k, and r. We set τ m = 4.5 since this is the peak of the empirical
success-hazard rate. We set r = 0.127, which would be the rate of return required by
the CAPM model given the β of VE returns and given the S&P 500 return over the
period. See the Appendix for details. This leaves us with only six free parameters:
π 0 , λ, δ, ρ, C, k. We fit the following eight features of the data:
1. the excess return,
2. the VC’s rate of return conditional on age,
3. the cost profile,
4. the cumulative cash flow,
5. the equity share of E,
6. the survival function,
7. the success hazard,
8. the termination hazard.
We now discuss how each of these eight features are determined by the data, and
how we constructed their theoretical counterparts in our example. We present the
formulae for the case δ = ∞, i.e., where the signal arrives immediately. Extending
them to the case where the signal is delayed is done in the Appendix. Figure 8
represents the fit of our numerical example. We start with the first panel of Figure 8:
Panel 1 : Excess Return.–We constrain the parameters to yield α = 4.8% and we
penalize highly any deviation from this value and so we end up with an α̂ very close
to the desired value.
Panel 2 : The rate of return profile.–Among projects that succeed at t, the VC’s
return, call it R (t), solves the equation
R
e−rt πdΓt
∗
exp {Rt} = (1 − s )
.
(27)
C + kr (1 − e−rt )

where Γ is The distribution of π among projects that succeed at time t. This is
an arithmetic return, because we first average the payoﬀs and then take the return.
The RHS is the ratio of the present values of revenues (averaged over the whole
portfolio) to those of costs. To derive it, note that projects with π < π min are
terminated at once. Between date zero and date t = h−1 ([a + k + rW ] /π min ), none
are terminated, and successes come from the distribution G (π | π ≥ π min ). At t =
h−1 ([a + k + rW ] /π min ), the truncation point, (a + k + rW ) /h (t) starts to move to
the right. Thus the distribution of π among projects that bear fruit at date t is just

The vertical axis in Panel 2 measures R (t) in (27). The horizontal axis measures
the firm’s age as of the date of the first VC investment. The highest returns are
on projects that succeed early. We stop at the seventh year as data become sparse
beyond that point and are heavily influenced by outliers.
Panel 3: The cost profile.–We shall fit C and k to the data on the investment
profile, i.e., the sequences of investment rounds, but converted to flows of investment
as a function of time. The predicted first-period investment relative to subsequent
investment is

We see some modest decline in the empirical series, but it comes several years later
than the predicted, second year.

and the initial condition J (0) = −p∗ , where p∗ is given in (11). For both the model
and the data in this case, we plot medians and not means so as to minimize the eﬀect
outliers at high ages.
Panel 5 : E’s equity.–Once E signs the contract with the VC, her share of the
a
project drops from unity to s∗ , where it remains until the end. We fit s∗ = a+k+rW
to Kaplan and Strömberg’s (2003, Table 2) numbers on cash flow rights, i.e., claims
on equity shares. Pooled over rounds, the claim of founders is 31.1%, of VCs 46.7%,
and of non-VC investors 22.2%. Since our model does not include non-VC investors,
we constrain s∗ to equal the share of founders in claims other than those of non-VC
investors, i.e.,
31.1
= 0.40.
(30)
s∗ ≈
31.1 + 46.7

The model underpredicts s∗ because it needs a large k in order to lessen the predicted
decline in Panel 3, and the final estimate is a compromise.
Panels 6, 7 and 8: Hazards and survivorship.–A project “survives” through date
t if it has neither succeeded (τ > t) nor been terminated (T (π) > t). We first need to
define terminations. By (3), π = (a + k + rW ) /h (T ) , and so the fraction of projects
terminated by date t conditional on no success until date t, i.e., Pr (T ≤ t | τ ≥ t), is

is the model ‘Survivor function’. The last three panels of Figure are not independent:
h and ψ imply S via (33). We measure S (t) by the ‘#left.’ This is the dashed
line in panel 6 of the figure. Our measure of h, ‘suc. hzd’ is calculated as (ipo +
acq)/(#left). Thus we treat IPOs and acquisitions as equivalent success realizations.
Finally, ‘fail hzd’ is the ratio (term)/(#left). This is the empirical counterpart of
ψ (t). The Appendix explains in detail.
Estimation procedure.–The estimates of our free parameters are determined as
the minimizers of the following loss function, RSS:

We only penalize two out of the three functions h(t), S(t) and ψ (t) since knowledge
of two pins down the third. We chose penalties on logarithms for some moments since
28

a simple quadratic scheme did not penalize absurd behavior suﬃciently; for example,
when the ratio k/C goes from 1/10 to 1/100, this is a big qualitative change in our eyes
but would not be penalized much by a purely quadratic scheme. For the weighting
scheme, we chose w = (5, 1, 1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.01). The high penalty on α reflects the
importance we attach to this parameter. The other penalties are chosen to reflect
the scale of the respective parameters. We used a Matlab-built-in line-search method
to minimize RSS with respect to the parameters of the model. The minimization
process proved to be very robust; the algorithm converged to the same solution for
almost any of about 100 randomly chosen starting points. The estimates are reported
together in Table 1, and some statistics of interest are reported in Table 2.

Table 1 : Parameter Estimates
Some implications of the parameter estimates.–Note that π 0 , the smallest possible
π in the support of G (see (24)), is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher
than C and k. The implied returns are therefore high if they come early, but the
expected waiting time until success is infinity because, since ρ < 1, the tail of the
Pareto portion of F distribution is thick. According to (26), the probability that
ρ
τ ≤ τ m = 4.5 years (which is when the hazard peaks) is 2+ρ
= 0.35
= 0.15. Thus the
2.35
returns are likely to be highly skewed regardless of the shape of G, simply because
most of them are small, so that a large fraction is terminated. The early returns are
λπ 0
the big winners. On top of this G is itself right skewed, with E (π) = λ−1
=$154 mil.
Finally, the mean signal-arrival time 1/δ = 2.2 years, i.e., the VC quickly learns the
quality of the project.
In our model, venture capital is homogeneous, but some diﬀerences could easily be
introduced. Suppose, e.g., that some VCs had better signals about a project’s likely
success, or could see them sooner. Such VCs would face a more favorable distribution
of waiting times, F , and of payoﬀs, G. Panel 1 of the Figure 8 shows that returns
drop oﬀ quickly as the waiting time increases so that an ability to bring successes
forward seems to have a very high return. If VCs diﬀered in quality because some
could see a better prior signal, then the high-quality VCs would have a W higher than
other VCs. The high-W VCs would then be more selective, having higher π min s and
lower T (π)s. Therefore ex-post project qualities would be positively correlated with
the qualities of the VCs that backed them. This would be consistent with Sørensen
(forthcoming) who finds that the bulk of the observed positive association between
VC quality and project quality is due not to direct VC influence on the payoﬀ but
to sorting. The following additional statistics were obtained from a Monte-Carlo
simulation of 3 million projects using the estimated parameters:

Conclusion

We estimated a model of the market for venture capital in which VCs were scarce
relative to the number of potential projects. The estimates imply a high equilibrium
return on VC capital which makes the VCs impatient to start new funds and to
terminate existing non-performing projects. This leads to a selection eﬀect that gives
rise to a tendency for VC-backed companies to reach IPOs earlier, and to be worth
more at IPO than other start-ups. Our results show that many of the diﬀerences
between the VC-backed and solo companies can be explained without assuming that
VCs add value to projects on aside from providing liquidity, or that the VC-backed
projects are ex-ante diﬀerent from solo ones.
We used the estimated model to infer the rate of return on venture capital and on
entrepreneurship, the latter rising with the entrepreneur’s wealth. The VC earned a
higher excess return than even the wealthiest entrepreneurs, but not by much. The
equilibrium was socially optimal for a range of parameter values.
The features of the contract were also determined by a sharing rule and an upfront payment. For a wide range of distributions of project quality and wealth on
the one hand, and for a wide range of VC supply on the other, the model says that
contracts should be the same. To the extent that they should arise at all, crosseconomy diﬀerences in contracts should be expressible in terms of just two statistics:
The share of up-front costs that the VC finances, and the VC’s share in the equity of
the project.

Appendix A: Omitted Proofs

Proof of Lemma 1.
(i) Suppose that w < k/r + C. From (5), τ 0 (w) =
1/ [k − r (w − C)]. Suppose now, that h−1 ((a + k) /π) > τ (w). That is, the project
with payoﬀ π is worth supporting longer than time τ (w). Since the support of π is
R+ , the measure of these π 0 s is positive. Then, by (7) and (8)

h (τ (w))
The first term is positive since w < k/r + C. The second term is also positive since
h−1 ((a + k) /π) ≥ τ (w). Suppose now that h−1 ((a + k) /π) < τ (w), that is E can
support the project with payoﬀ π as long as it is socially optimal. The measure of
such π 0 s is positive because π min is positive. Then, by (7) and (8)

a + k −rt
q (π, w) =

h (t)

and

We can conclude that

(ii) Suppose now that w < k/r + C, that is, E never runs out of money when she is

and hence dQE /dw = 0. By assumption, the social value of the project is positive.
This implies that the unconstrained entrepreneur generates a larger expected payoﬀ
by optimally supporting a project than abandoning. But the payoﬀ of supporting a
project in excess to that yielded by abandoning is exactly QE (w) − C, and hence
QE (w) > C.
Proof of Lemma 2. Recall that QE (w∗ ) = C and QE (C) = 0 (see Figure
2). Since QE is strictly increasing in w on [0, k/r + C] by Lemma 1, it follows that
w∗ > C. Hence, in order to prove (13) we only have to show that p∗ > 0. We show
more, we prove that

The inequality follows from T E being the solo’s optimal termination rule (and not
T V C ), and the last equality from (43). Since T was arbitrary in the previous inequality
chain, (44) follows.
It remained to show that (19) even if π > π min . If π > πmin then T V C (π) > 0
and by (20) T E (π) > 0. Since h is decreasing at T V C (π) and T E (π), a comparison
of (6) and (4) implies T E (π) > T V C (π).
Proof of Proposition 3.
First, we show πmin (w) is decreasing in w and
E
constant, π min , on [k/r + C, ∞). Recall that π min (w) can be defined such that
q (π, w) = 0 ⇔ π ≤ πmin (w) .
Hence, in order to prove that π min (w) is decreasing it is enough to show that q (π, w)
is increasing in w. Suppose that w1 > w2 . Recall from (7) that

where the inequality follows because τ is increasing (see (5)). Also notice from (5) that
the inequality is weak whenever w1 , w2 ≥ k/r + C. This shows that π min (w) = π smin
whenever w ≥ k/r + C.
Finally, since π min (w) is decreasing in w and τ is increasing and constant on
[k/r + C, ∞), the statement of the proposition directly follows from (8).

Appendix B: Data and the Estimation

This Appendix was written by Matthias Kredler

9.1

Data

In general, we will denote the quantities implied by the model by plain letters (x,
e.g.), whereas the moments from the data are denoted by the same letter carrying a
hat (x̂).
9.1.1

The data on α and r

The value α̂ = 0.048 that we use is inferred from the quarterly value αq = 0.0117 that
Jones and Rhodes-Kropf (2004) report on the bottom of panel A in their table 2. In
order to compute the discount rate r = 0.127 that we use in the computations, we
create the typical return for an investment with the characteristics of VC projects
following the capital asset pricing model (CAPM):
r = rf + β V C (rm − rf ) = 0.127
We compute rf = 0.026 as the mean of the return on 3-month treasury bills from
1980 to 1999, which is the sample period for Jones and Rhodes-Kropf (2004)’s data.
Similarly, we compute rm = 0.082 as the mean of the return on a value-weighted
portfolio of stocks listed on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ provided by the Center
for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) over the same period. The value β V C = 1.80
is calculated as the sum of the 5 quarterly β-coeﬃcients that Jones and RhodesKropf (2004) provide in their table 1, panel B.
9.1.2

The data on R(t)

We calculate the following statistic over all projects that succeed during year t:

s=1

i,s

where time is counted from zero on for each project when it receives its first investment
round. The term in brackets can be seen as the excess return over r of a big portfolio
of VC projects that succeeded after t years. Taking logs and dividing by t annualizes
this quantity. We take the logs after averaging over all projects since VC returns are
driven by outliers; there is a strong Jensen’s-inequality eﬀect that understates the
influences of big winners when logs are taken before averaging.
For r, we use the same number as derived in paragraph 9.1.1. In the denominator,
we have investment cash flows for project i in year s (after the first investment). The
data are taken again from Guler (2003). They are annualized log returns for the
projects in Guler’s sample and we reproduce them in Table A1:
40

Year 1-2y 2-3y 3-4y 4-5y 5-6y 6-7y 7-8y
R(t) 1.59 0.59 0.49 0.26 0.28 0.26 0.16
Table A1
The data are also plotted as the dashed line in Panel 2 of Figure 8. We restrict it
to the years 2 to 8 for the following reasons: For projects succeeding during the first
year, it is impossible to distinguish between investment and revenue since there is
only one net cash flow in the data. For the years after the 8th year, the data become
very sparse — we have less than 10 data points in each of these years. Therefore these
are not used in the estimation.
9.1.3

The data on k/C

As a typical value for C, we take Ĉ = $2.6m. This number is reported by Kaplan,
Sensoy and Strömberg (2002) in table 2 as the book value of a VC portfolio company
at the business plan in the median. In order to get an estimate k̂ for the typical
monetary investment k that a portfolio company requires each year, we employ again
the data from Guler (2003, Table 6, column 2):

Amount ($ millions) 6.5 5.3 5.5 7 8.4 6.4 5.9 8.2 3.4 8.1 3.4 3.4
Table A2
Because the model has k paid per unit of time and C at the outset, we need
to convert these data for spending by investment round into spending per year. By
comparing the speed of terminations we arrived at the conversion factor for converting
rounds into flows. If Ij is the average amount invested in round j, we convert this
into a flow It = θt It , where11

As an estimate for the typicalPyearly investment flow once the initial investment round
T

is over, we obtain k̂ = T −1
t=2 θ t It =$3.68m, again from Guler’s data. Hence the
target value becomes k̂/Ĉ = 1.42.
11

Between the first and the sixth round,the termination hazard falls from 0.12 to 0.08. On the
other hand, between year 1 and year 6, the termination hazard falls from 0.09 to 0.04. Thus the
8
1
ratio of the two hazards rises from 12
9 = 1.25 to 4 = 2 . As a rough calculation, then, initially,
rounds are once every 1.25 years, and by year 6, they are once every 1.5 years.

41

9.1.4

The data on J(t)

To estimate the cumulative cash-flow J(t) of a typical project, we take the average
cumulative cash-flow in Guler’s data up to year t. Guler’s data for π are the market
valuations for the respective company at IPO or at acquisition. In line with the value
s∗ = 0.40 that we use (see below), we assume that 60% of these revenues accrue to
VCs. Furthermore, for the positive cash-flows in the formula for J 0 (t) in section 4.0.5
we calculate conditional medians at t instead of conditional means (as is done for the
statistics inferred from the model, since it is easier to evaluate)– we do this because
the mean is very sensitive to the extreme outliers that are present in Guler’s data.

These data are from the VentureExpert database provided by Venture Economics, and
are described in detail by Guler (2003). For clarity of the argument, the following
table reproduces the Data Summary Table from Section 6 of the paper and will help us
discuss in greater detail the data on successes and terminations and the construction
of the variables.
‘Age’ is measured as the number of periods since the date of the first VC investment. Note that this measure of age is diﬀerent from the measure in Figure 7 where
‘age’ is time elapsed since the firm was founded.

The last three columns are plotted as the dashed lines in panels six (there normalized
by dividing by 1355), seven and eight of Figure 8.
Here is how we calculated the hazards:
1. Column 6, “# left” is the empirical counterpart of (1 − F [t]) (1 − Φ [t]), i.e., of
S (t) in (33).
2. Column 7, “ĥ” is the ratio (ipo + acq)/(#left). That is, we treat IPOs and
acquisitions as equivalent success realizations. So, e.g., the value of this ratio
at age 1 is 39+19
= 0.043, its value at age 2 is 54+49
= 0.089, and so on. We now
1335
1158
show that this is the empirical counterpart of h (t). The sum of the columns (ipo
+ acq) we interpret as the number of successes at date t among firms for whom
T > t. The probability of τ = t and its surviving beyond t is f (t) (1 − Φ [t]).
Therefore we equate these two concepts:
(ipo + acq) = f (t) (1 − Φ [t]) .

Therefore as calculated in Column 7, the “success hazard” is
ipo + acq
f (t) (1 − Φ [t])
f (t)

# left
(1 − F [t]) (1 − Φ [t])

3. Column 8, “ψ̂” is the ratio (term)/(#left). This is the empirical counterpart of ψ (t); to see why, note that term is the number terminated at date
t among firms for whom T ≥ t and τ ≥ t. The probability of T = t and
τ ≥ t is Φ0 (t) (1 − F [t]). Therefore we equate the two concepts: (term)

9.2

Numerical algorithm to solve the model

To solve the model, we make use of the monotonic relationship between W and C.
As is apparent from equation (22), the value W of a generic project before the first
investment increases monotonically in C. So when fixing all other model parameters
and W in equation (22), there is only one level of C that is congruent with these
parameter values.
We make use of this fact by declaring W a parameter of the model and then
backing out C as a result of it. This has two advantages: It is computationally
easier, and it allows us to keep W in the positive range, which is a requirement to
have a VC market at all. Note that, however, negative values for C may be obtained
in certain parameter regions, i.e. a payment to the VC in the beginning is needed to
reach a certain level W given the other parameters. However, negative levels of C
are penalized in the estimation, so that this is not a problem in the estimation.
Throughout, we use quadrature methods to solve the various integrals in the model
equations. The main advantage of these methods is that only a small number of function evaluations is needed to obtain a precise approximation. An obvious alternative
is Monte-Carlo integration, i.e. the simulation of a large number of projects. This
has the disadvantage that many more function evaluations are necessary to obtain a
good approximation. We use Monte-Carlo simulation in the end to check the results
we obtain by quadrature methods and find that quadrature performs very well.
It actually turns out that the Monte-Carlo integrals have some variance even
when the number of simulated projects goes into the millions — this is because the
distribution for π is Pareto and does not have finite variance under the estimated
parameter λ = 1.9. Hence the speed of convergence of the Monte-Carlo integrals is
lower than for finite-variance problems (but the Law of Large Numbers for the mean
still holds, of course).
9.2.1

How to find π min (x)

There are two cases to consider when determining the lowest level of π tolerated by
a VC when learning π at time x:
• x ≥ τ m , where τ m is the peak of the hazard rate: It is suﬃcient to look at the
FOC:
1 + rW
(1 + rW )τ m
π min (x) =
=
h(x)
ρ
• x < τ m : In this case we cannot use the FOC. However, we know that the

where T̃ (π) = h−1 [(1 − rW )/π] fulfills the FOC for optimal stopping. Note
that this value is net of the opportunity cost W of scrapping the project at
once (i.e. at x). The integral in the formula above can be approximated by
Legendre Quadrature. As for all integrals calculated by quadrature methods in
this algorithm, we use 30 quadrature nodes. The root of the equation is found
by a Matlab-built-in numerical technique. We calculate πmin (x) for all values on
a grid between zero and τ m ; then we interpolate linearly between these points
to obtain values for π min (x) between the grid points.
A plot of the π min (x) function under the estimated parameters can be found in
the left panel of Figure 9.
9.2.2

Vrev (x): the value of signal revelation at time x

Define Vrev (x) as follows:
Vrev (x) =

Z

∞

Ṽ (x, π)dG(π),

π min (x)

where Ṽ (x, π) is given in equation (50). The function Vrev (x) value plays a crucial role
when finding T0 , but also for the computation of C given W (or vice versa). Since the
upper bound of integration is infinity and the integrand does not have closed form,
computation of this integral is not straightforward.
To approximate the solution, note that the value of a project Ṽ (x, π) becomes
linear in π in the limit; to determine a (large) π̄ where the function is very close to
the asymptote, consider the following:
Z
π + W + 1/r ρ̃π −r(t−x)

We want to find π̄ suﬃciently large so that the underbraced term equal to some very
small ε. We solve numerically for the relevant π̄ after taking logs (the terms e−rx and
45

S(x) are not taken into account here since they also appear in the other two terms
in (??) — we want to make ε small relative to these terms):
ρ ln π̄ + rρ̃π̄ = − ln ε + ln μ − ρ ln ρ̃ + ρ ln(τ m )
We choose ε = 10−5 in the implementation. The equation can be solved numerically
for π̄.
In the calculations for Vrev (x), we evaluate the integral from π min to π̄ with Legendre quadrature; for the region above we use the following approximation:
V (π) = Aπ + A(W + 1/r) −
where

can be verified that the function V (π) is smooth (i.e. infinitely often diﬀerentiable),
so quadrature yields very good results.
9.2.3

Find T0

Note that the FOC for T0 as given in equation (23) is decreasing in T0 for values
greater than τ m : πmin (x) is increasing in x since the hazard is declining, and the
function below the integral is declining in T0 . The first-order condition at t is:
F OC(t) = δVrev (t) + h(t)E[π] − (a + k) − rW
The root of this function above τ m is found numerically. Should the FOC be
already negative at τ m –in this case, the VC would (in almost all cases) never want
to keep a project alive–we penalize heavily in the solution algorithm.

9.2.4

Find C given W

As described before, we have made C an outcome in terms of the parameter W , and
we have to solve the following equation to obtain C:
Z T0
V (x)dB(x) + e−δT0 V (T0 ).
C = −W − 1/r +
0

We use integration by parts here to account for the variable costs: First, pay the
lifetime value 1/r for all projects, then re-gain e−rt /r when the project comes to an
end — note that this yields the correct value (1 − ert )/r for each project. V (x) is
the time-0 value of all projects with revelation time x; this value does not change
anymore for x > T0 since the policy is the same for all these projects; they yield E[π]
in all periods before T0 , and then they are shut down.
This is the formula for V (x):
Z πmin (x)

V (x) =
H(π, x)dG(π) +
H(π, T ∗ (π))dG(π),

where
H(x, π) =

e−rt (π + W + 1/r)dF (t) + e−rx [1 − F (x)](W + 1/r).

H(x, π) can be calculated in a similar way as described for Ṽ (x, π) before when fixing
x and π. The first term of V (x) is easier to calculate since the policy does not vary
— either the project succeeds before x, or it is shut down at signal revelation:

Weights for the project pool

The mass of screened projects that is still alive at time t is the following:
Z th
i
Hscr (t) =
1 − G (max{π min (x), π min (t)}) dB(x)

For details of the calculation strategy in this case, refer to the description of the
numerical implementation of the solution for R(t). In terms of terminations, we can
write for t < T0 :
Hscr (t) = 1 − |{z}
e−δt −
Hterm (t)
| {z }
unscreened

screened and terminated

So the weight of screened projects in successes, i.e. the probability that a project had
been screened conditional on success, is
hscr (t) =

Hscr (t)
Hscr (t) + e−δt

A plot of this function under the estimated parameter values can be found on the
right panel of Figure 9.
9.2.6

Calculate α

Compute the expected present value CP V = CPMV + CPCV of all costs for the VC:
Clearly, the part coming from marginal cost must be CPMV = k/r, since the VC will
never be idle and hence always pay a flow cost k. The part CPCV stemming from the
repeated payment of the fixed cost C can be obtained in a recursive fashion:
CPCV = C + E[e−rT CPCV ],
where T = min{τ , T ∗ (π)} is the time of success or termination of the project,
whichever comes first. From this, we obtain

E[e−rT ] can be computed in a manner quite similar to C, so the computation procedure is not explained again here. Now, we can obtain the α implied by the model:
α = W/CP V , as given in equation (55).
48

9.2.7

Calculate R(t)

We now calculate the implied returns as determined by (27). We first need the density
of projects in the (x, π)-space at a given time t, i.e., the density on the pool of projects
that is still not terminated at time t. To obtain this density, first define
(
b(x)g(x)I(π ≥ π min (x, t)) if x ≤ t
q̂(x, π|t) =
b(x)g(x)I(t ≤ T0 )
if x > t
where πmin (x, t) = max{π min (x), πmin (t)} is the lowest project quality left from the
pool of projects screened at time x, and I(·) is the indicator function for an event.
Then the density of a pair (π, x) at time t is
q(x, π|t) =

Ct may be calculated as

The left-hand side here is approximated by Legendre Quadrature over the smooth
parts of the integrand; notice that for t > τ m , πmin (x, t) will be flat over some interval
on x and vary on the rest of the values for x (at least under reasonable parameters).
In this case, we employ quadrature on each of these parts in order to be operating
over a smooth integrand.
In a similar fashion we can then calculate the expected π for a succeeding project
at t:

E[π|t] =
πq(π, x|t)dx + I(t ≤ T0 )[1 − B(t)]E[π]

Note that the integrand in the term on the left can be evaluated in closed form since

the estimated parameters can be found in the left panel of Figure 9. Now we have

C
and (52), but with W set equal to zero, and with π Vmin
replaced by π Emin . The same can
k
C
also be said for Es with wealth w < C + r , except that π Vmin
replaced by π Emin (w), and
that ψE,w (t) becomes infinite at t = τ (w) defined in (5). We compute the survival
function S(t), t = 0, 1, .., 12 as follows:
£
¤
S(t) = [1 − F (t)] 1 − ΦV C (t) ,

where the terminations C.D.F. ΦV C (t) is just the converse of the variable Ct calculated before to obtain R(t) in paragraph 9.2.7. We calculate S(t) at the exact points
t = 0, t = 1 etc. since the survival is a stock variable which is measured exactly at
these points in the data, too.
The success hazard h(t), t = 1, .., 12 is computed according to the formula given
in section 9.5. Note that since success is purely exogenous, this hazard is solely
51

governed by τ m and ρ. We evaluate the hazard in the model in the middle of the
period corresponding to a year in the data, e.g. at t = 0.5 for the first year, since the
data to calculate the empirical hazard stem from successes that are spread out over
the entire first year; in other words, the hazard is a flow concept.
Also the terminations hazard ψ (t) is calculated for t = 1, .., 12 since it is a flow
variable in the data, too. In this case we compute the exact sample analog: For
the hazard over year 2, for example, we take the diﬀerence between the terminations
C.D.F. ΦV C (t) at t = 1 and t = 2 and then divide by the survival S(1).

9.3

Loss Function

The set of unknown parameters is {ρ, π 0 , λ, C, k}. To estimate them, we fix τ m = 4.5
since this is the peak of the empirical hazard rate. Furthermore, we set r = 0.127 as
described before in paragraph 9.1.1.
We specify the loss function RSS for a set of parameters (ρ, π0 , λ, k, W ) and the
moments from the data as follows:

(53)

We only penalize two out of the three functions h(t), S(t) and ψ (t) since knowledge
of two pins down the third. We chose penalties on logarithms for some moments since
a simple quadratic scheme did not penalize absurd behavior suﬃciently; for example,
when the ratio k/C goes from 1/10 to 1/100, this is a big qualitative change in our
eyes but would not be penalized much by a purely quadratic scheme.
For the weighting scheme, we chose w = (5, 1, 1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.01). The high
penalty on α reflects both the importance we attach to this parameter and its low
scale. The other penalties are chosen to reflect the scale of the respective parameters.
We use a Matlab-built-in line-search method to minimize RSS with respect to the
parameters of the model. The minimization process proved to be very robust; the
algorithm converged to the same solution for almost any of about 100 randomly chosen
starting points. Using numerical gradients and standard errors of the moments, it
is possible to obtain (approximate) standard errors for our estimators. This is an
important next step in this project.
The described weighting scheme yielded the estimates reported in Table 2A. Estimates of R, S, and h are plotted in Figure 8.

Statistics from the solo entrepreneur’s problem
How to find π min (w, x)

For the solo entrepreneur with wealth w and an associated time τ (w) where she
runs out of wealth, we have the following value of a project with known π at x, for
simplicity here in terms of time 0:
µ
¶
Z min{ρπ,τ (w)}

−rt
Vs (w, x, π) =
π−
dF (t)
e
h(t)
x
The root of this equation is called π min (w, x); this is the payoﬀ where the solo entrepreneur of wealth π is just indiﬀerent between terminating and continuing a project.
The numeric solution to this problem is implemented just as the one in the analogous
equation for the VC described in paragraph 9.2.1.
We first take a grid over the wealth levels of interest, [C, C + k/r]. Then, for each
wealth level w on the grid, we calculate πmin (w, x) for a grid point xi ∈ [0, τ (w)]. By
linearly interpolating between the grid points in the (w, x)-plane it is then possible
to obtain an approximate π min (w, x) for any point (w, x).
A plot of the function E[π|t] for the unconstrained entrepreneur and for a constrained entrepreneur with w=9m$ can be found in the left panel of Figure 9.
9.4.2

The solo entrepreneur’s FOC for T0 (w)

For entrepreneurs with τ (w) < τ m , we set T0 = τ (w), i.e. the entrepreneur does not
terminate projects of unknown value before she runs out of money. In the reasonable
parameter region, the first-order condition for T0 is increasing below τ m , so that the
entrepreneur would terminate everything at t = 0 — we want to avoid this to see
where the entrepreneurs profits cut zero. The entrepreneur’s first-order condition for
T0 is indeed

=Vs,rev (w,x)

For τ (w) > τ m , we check this condition at τ m and τ (w): If it is not positive at τ m , we
set T0 = τ m –the reasoning for this is the same as before for the case τ (w) < τ m . If
it is still positive at τ (w), then the solo entrepreneur will let all unscreened projects
survive until the end, and we set T0 = τ (w). Otherwise, we solve the above equation
for a root — this root must be unique since the FOC is downward-sloping for t > τ m .
Again, we encounter the problem that the integral’s upper limit in the FOC is
infinity, as was the case for the analogous problem of the VC in paragraph 9.2.3.
However, in the entrepreneurs case we have a natural upper bound for the linear

53

asymptote: The function will already be linear for π such that ρπ ≥ τ (w). Hence we
re-state the revelation value as follows:

9.4.3

The VC’s and entrepreneur’s net worth and excess return

Derivation of (55).–To arrive at W and CP V we discount by r, the rate of return
required given the risk characteristics of the income stream that the VC faces. That
rate depends partly on the covariance of the VC’s income stream with the market
index, i.e., β. Let rf denote the risk-free interest rate, and let rS&P denote the expected
return on the market index for which we shall use the S&P 500 as a proxy. Then the
CAPM prediction for the expected return on venture capital is
r = rf + β (rS&P − rf ) .
To verify (55) in another way, let time be discrete and assume that each company
matures and yields π for sure at the end of one period. Let p = 1 and k = 0. Then
one dollar today yields π dollars a period from now, and so the excess return on the
investment would be
α = π − (1 + r) .
(54)
Now let us instead calculate the excess return using (55): The VC then invests in a
1
new company every period, and his discount factor is 1+r
. Therefore
W =

1
π − (1 + r)
and CP V =
1
1 .
1 − 1+r
1 − 1+r

Substituting these values into (55) gives us the same value of α as (54) does.
The lifetime value of venture capital is W , of which roughly a fraction 1 −
R −rt
e |dS (t)| stems from the current project and the remainder from future project.
The expected present value of lifetime investment of a VC in current units is CP V ≡

of r is
QE (w) − C
.
(56)
ε (w) =
CPwV
At w∗ E is indiﬀerent between going solo and abandoning the project, hence ε (w∗ ) =
0. Since ∂QE (w) /∂w > 0, the numerator rises with w, but so does the denominator.
It rises with E’s level of wealth. The excess return becomes flat at the point C + k/r,
i.e., the point where the solo E ceases to be liquidity constrained in any state of the
world, i.e., for any realization of π.
To calculate the present value of a project at t = 0 and the present value of the
cost, we first define the optimal scrapping time as T ∗ (w, π) = min{ρπ, τ (w)}. Then
we have

Unlike the other integrals, we compute the value of the project for the solo entrepreneur by Monte-Carlo methods. We simulate three million projects, apply the
optimal policies for a wealth level w which are given by the function πmin (w, x) and
the number T0 (w) , and then calculate the averages corresponding to the integral for
V (w). We do this for the entire grid of wealth levels defined before.
The solo return for the entrepreneur is then simply
QS (w) = w + V (w)
where V (w) is given above. The excess return ε(w) is given by the ratio of expected
discounted revenue to expected discounted cost (both discounted at the same r used
in the VC model), which are again computed by Monte-Carlo integration.
55

We use Monte-Carlo integration here instead of quadrature methods because they
are easier to implement; notice that we only calculate the statistics for the solo entrepreneur after having found the optimal parameter vector, so computational parsimony
is not a concern here.

Procedure behind Figure 7

This how the empirical distribution of company’s age at IPO was obtained excluding
rollups and spinoﬀs:
• First, we matched the data on all firms on Ritter’s website (N = 8, 309) with
the list he sent to us, which are the ones that are backed by VCs (N = 2, 899).
• We only consider the year of the oﬀering date, getting rid of the month and the
day. The diﬀerence between this year and the founding year is the age at IPO.
IssueAge.
• All records for which one of the two years is missing (27 companies) and for
which the age at IPO turns out to be negative (3 companies, these are presumably errors in the data) are excluded.
• This leaves 5, 522 companies that were solo at IPO and 2, 784 companies that
were VC-backed.
• Now, these data are matched to the data from Ritter about spinoﬀs. Companies
that are spinoﬀs are excluded, which eliminates 810 records.
• Also, the company data are manually matched to the data from Brown, Dittmar
and Servaes (2005) on rollups: This creates five matches, but none of these
matches results in new exclusions since the records had been excluded in one
of the earlier stages.
• In the end, we have NS = 4, 850 solo companies and NV C = 2, 675 VC-backed
companies left in the sample.
The two graphs show the following:
1. Empirical pdf: This is the proportion of companies that had IPO exactly at
age t.
2. Empirical cdf: This is the proportion of IPOs up to (and including) age t.
The dotted lines are confidence bands at 95%-confidence level (two-sided); they
come from the Matlab-built-in Kaplan-Meier method.
