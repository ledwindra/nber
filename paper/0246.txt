CAUSATION AMONG SOCIOECONOMIC TIME SERIES

Robert T. Michael

ABSTRACT

Using annual U. S. time series data from 1950—1974, formal
tests of causation are performed among three socioeconomic phenomena:
women's labor force participation rates, fertility rates, and divorce

rates. Box—Jenkins and other techniques are employed with Granger—Sims
type definition of causation based on leads and lags.

Women's labor force participation appears to be causally prior
to both fertility and divorce; the direction of effect on fertility is

negative and on divorce, positive. Additional tests with alternative
definitions of variables and a longer (1924—1974) time span also exhibit

causal influence from fertility to divorce (with no feedback). When per
capita income is also tested for causal influence, it, too, appears
causally prior to fertility and divorce.

This paper addresses the question of causation among three socioeconomic phenomena, fertility, divorce and women's labor force participa-

tion, in the U.S. during the post—World War II era. Section I discusses
the hypothesized relationships among the three; Section II discusses the
notion of causation and recently developed macro—economic time series
techniques for identifying causation using rather sophisticated methods

of studying leads and lags. Section III reports findings using these
techniques, and Section IV extends the investigation to include the causal
relationships between these three socioeconomic variables and income.
Section V is a brief summary.

I.

Behavioral Patterns
Over the past thirty years in the U.S. profound changes have occurred

in several dimensions of family life including fertility, divorce, and

women's labor force behavior. These interrelated changes are discussed
in several disciplines that offer broadly similar explanations, and these

.1

explanations accord with the layman s armchair analysis.

Thus from an

analytical point of view the decline In fertility since the late 1950's,
the rise In women's LFPR, and the rise in divorce rates in recent years

seem to fit together rather well. If one of these series was justifiably
viewed as causally prior, it would be relatively easy to understand why

the others behaved as they did. But which might be the prime mover?
The existing literature suggests considerable simultaneous causation

among these three aspects of socioeconomic behavior. Relying on a single
recent volume of papers (Schultz (1974)). plus one article on divorce
behavior (Becker, Landes, Michael (1977)), we are told that:

2

LF<

That is, fertility (F) and women's labor force participation rates (LF)
are expected to be mutually causal and negatively related, F and divorce
rates (D) are expected to be mutually causal and negatively related,

while LF and D are also expected to be mutually causal and positively
related. In empirical studies, however, one finds few attempts to investi-

gate interdependence among these three dimensions of behavior. Some
researchers select one as a dependent variable using others as "exogenous"
influences, while other researchers employ the same basic variables with

causal links assumed to be reversed. Indeed, the list of those who have
themselves "run the regression" both ways is not unimpressive.
The best strategy for studying these interrelated phenomena is

debatable. One strategy would be to estimate a system of simultaneous
equations representing quasi—structural relationships. There are many
fundamental causes of the change in fertility, women's labor force and
divorce behavior suggested in the literature, including improved labor
market opportunities for women due in part to a shift toward services in
the cumposition of output; rise in real income; growth of social (i.e.
governmental) provision of various services including old age insurance,
medical care, child care, et cetera; growing acceptance of personal
freedoms including sexual freedom (prompted in part by medical technology

in fertility control); et cetera. These and other social and technical
forces have surely affected socioeconomic behavior, but research on

3

several of these separate structural equations has not progressed very
far as yet, so this strategy does not appear most fruitful at this time.
Development of rigorous life cycle models of these interdependent socioeconomic decisions represent another research strategy, but these models
of so many decisions become practically intractable.
Consequently, the strategy adopted here is a less demanding one.

Using techniques developed recently for use in judging causation among
macro—economic series (e.g., see Sims (1972)), pairwise tests of causa-

tion are performed among several post—war annual time series. Regarding
these tests, recent literature suggests that there has developed general

agreement about an appropriate definition of causality which can be
implemented empirically, but that there is less consensus about the
appropriate procedure for making it operational (see the Pierce—Granger—

Sims JASA Exchange, 1977, and see Hsiao (1977)). This is the first
attempt of which I am aware to apply these time series techniques to the
area of economics of human behavior.

II. The Notion of Causation
The concept of causation used here is that proposed by Granger (1969)

and Sims (1972) and essentially involves predictability: given two time
series

and Y, Y is said to cause X if the prediction of X conditional

on X1 is improved by using information about
Sims (1972) has shown that causation can be inferred, using a linear
prediction equation, by regressing a suitably transformed (stationary)
series of X on the past and future values of a stationary series of Y.
If future values of Y,

are as a group statistically related to X

(as judged by a partial F—test on the set of

i=l."n) then X is said

4

to cause Y. This evidence of feedback causation from X to Y is based on
the logic that future values of Y could not have caused a change in current
based on

values of X. (Of course, it is possible that expectations of
information available at time t but not yet incorporated in

itself have

affected Xe.)

This procedure for establishing causation is essentially definitional.
If lead—values of Y are statistically related to X in a regression on a
detrended, covariance stationary series with no serial correlation in the

regression's residuals, then X causes Y. The causation test from X
to Y using feedback from

to

involves the logic of inferritig causation

from the sequence of leads and lags. Concluding from these tests that X
causes Y does not imply X is the sole cause of Y or even that it has a
quantitatively large influence on Y; it implies only that evidence is
observed of a statistically significant causal link from X to Y.
Procedurally the issue becomes how best to produce stationary series
in X and Y that yield linear regressions with no serial correlation in the

residual. One relatively extreme procedure employs the time series
techniques of Box—Jenkins (1976) applied to each series separately. That
is, assume the series X is generated by a discrete linear stochastic

process which, when estimated, can be removed from the series X yielding

a series X which is a white noise series (i.e. a series of identically
and independently distributed random variables with mean zero and variance
a2)

The series X is

X =k

+EX. + X.

(1)

5

So in principle, by estimating k and 1,

the

series of random——unanticipated

or unpredicted——shocks X can be calculated. Box—Jenkins procedures employ

The F—test on the set of coefficients b. for I =

(2)

+1, +2, . . .m constitutes

the test of feedback causation from X to Y. This is one of the tests used
below. This Box—Jenkins method of filtering the initial series X and Y
has been employed in test of causation among a number of monetary variables

(see Pierce (1977)). However, it has been criticized, by e.g. Sims (1977),
as containing a bias in favor of the null hypothesis of no causation (this is
further discussed below).

A second filtering procedure applies a single, predetermined filter to

both the X and Y series to whiten them. The filter (l—O.75L)2 for lag
operator L is used here as elsewhere. That filter is intended also to

produce whitened series X and yS which can be used to estimate equation
(2) yielding another test of the feedback causation from X to Y.

By

running equation (2) reversing the X and Y series, an analogous test of

causation from Y to X can be made using either the Box—Jenkins—filtered
series or the single—filtered series.
A third method of performing this test involves a somewhat different

procedure, appealing in terms of its intuitive nature. One regresses the
original series X on lagged values of itself and lagged values of Y and

uses the F—test on the lagged Y as the direct test of causation from Y to X.
That is, regress

and use the partial F—test on the set of coefficients iX as the test of

The pair of equations (3) and (4) constitutes a simultaneous system in X

and Y which can be estimated as "seemingly unrelated" equations. The
important issue for the F—test is that each of the error terms be serially
uncorrelated.

III. Findings

LF, F and D: 1950—1974. The following three annual time series for
the post—war period are studied:
F:

fertility: the annual number of births per 1000 women aged
14—44; p = 108.0, a = 12.0

LF: labor force participation rate of women, defined for women with
spouse present and with children under the age of six; p = 20.1,
a =
D:

6.2

divorce rate: the annual number of divorces and annulments per
1000 married couples; p = 11.5, a = 3.1

Using these three series, all six possible directions of causation are

tested using each of the three filtering procedures just described: the
Box—Jenkins or ARIMA

filter,

2

the single filter (1—0.75L) , and the simul-

taneous system approach. For the first two procedures a first—stage filtering is performed on each series and then equation (2) is estimated for
all six permutations of the pairs of three variables and the partial F—test

7

on the lead values of

'+2 and Y3 is used as the test of causation

on X and Y. In the third filtering procedure equation (3) is estimated on
the original X and Y series and the partial F—test

—1' —v

from

the. regression on X is used as the test of causation from Y to X.

The Box—Jenkins first—stage estimation of each series' ARIMA structure

is shown in Table 1. Panel A shows the autocorrelatjons while Panel B
indicates the estimated structures and related diagnostics.3 Table 2
col. (1) reports the relevant tests of causation among these ARIMA—filtered

series. Only two of the six pair—wise relationships exhibit causation
(at 90% level of confidence). Four of the tests do not reject the null
hypothesis of no causation; we can say that the labor force series "causes"
the divorce series, and that the fertility series "causes" the labor force

series. Finding relatively few causal relationships is quantitatively
not unlike Pierce's (1977) results for various monetary series. It is
also not inconsistent with Granger's contention that, "The empirical fact
[is] that weak relationships will often be found in economics when a

sound method of analysis is applied" (Granger, 1977, p. 23). However,
Sims' point about downward bias in these tests suggests that other filtering schemes besides the Box—Jenkins procedure should be investigated.

The single—filter approach yielded even weaker results as shown in Table 2
col. (3) —— none of the pairs of variables exhibited a statistically

significant relationship.4
The tests of causation from the simultaneous system of equations,

shown in col. (5) of Table 2, yield a different picture: three of these
estimated causal links are significant at conventional levels of confi-

dence.5 LF appears to cause both the divorce and fertility series (at

8

= .05) and there is less statistically significant evidence (ct = .10)
of causation from fertility to labor force participation rates of women.
Using the estimated two—equation relationship between LF and D, a
one—unit increase in LFt raises divorce by, say, year t+3 by 0.24; a one—

unit increase in LF lowers fertility by year t+3 by —1.41 while the
causation from F to LF implies that a one—unit increase in Ft lowers LF by

t+3 by only —0.09. If we convert these three—year duration effects into

Extensions: Age specific F and LF series, and a longer time period.
Two additional relationships have been investigated to provide some further

check on these results. One uses age—specific series for LF and F over
the same twenty—five year time period (1950—1974), the other extends the
estitration where possible to a fifty year period (1924—1974). The LFPR
of married women aged 25—34, LF3O, is available in the post—war period
(note that this variable does not control for age of or presence of

children). Also available (for a longer time—span) is age—specific fertility, F25, the number of children ever born to women age 25 (from Heuser

9

(1976)). The variable F25 is an age—specific stock—fertility measure
while the variable used above, F, is a flow measure defined over all ages

of women.6 Given that F25 is a stock measure at age 25 while LF3O is a
flow measure of labor force attachment of women 25—34 it seems reasonable
to expect F25 - LF3O but rather unlikely that LF3O - F25 (of course, a

scenario with anticipations of future labor force attachment affecting

current fertility is possible). Regarding the divorce series, no age—
specific series is available for the whole post—war period; a series has
been constructed for 1960—1970 for women 25—29 and for that decade the age—
specific series is highly correlated with the total divorce rate series D
(correlation =

0.95).

So the series D will be assumed to be an adequate

proxy for a divorce rate for women in their late 20's, and thus D is
investigated together with LF3O and F25.

Table 3, Panel A shows the results of the F—tests for pairs of these
three series, LF3O, F25, and D estimated from the two equation system.
Again the labor force series appears to "cause" changes in the D series:
the coefficients on this statistically significant relationship imply that

a one—unit increase in LF30 raises Dt+3 by +0.13. However, LF3O does not
appear to cause changes in the P25 series; that is what we should expect,

as indicated in the preceding paragraph. There is evidence of causation
from the stock of fertility, F25, to the divorce rate, while no such
causation was found using the flow measure of fertility, F.

(Here a 0.1

increase in F25 lowers Dt÷3 by —0.14.) The most puzzling result in this
set of tests is the lack of causation from F25 to LF3O. It seems reasonable that changes in the stock of fertility to 25—year—old women might be

causally linked to the subsequent changes in LFPR of women 25—34. The test
does not provide support for that hypothesis. In surmnary:

10

F25

LF3O

The variables D, F and F25 are available as annual time series over

the fifty year period 1924—1974. Panel B of Table 3 shows the comparable
results for the two—equation systems estimated over this time span. (As
the degrees of freedom are larger in these regressions I experimented with

six—year lags on F and F25 as well as the usual three—year lags.) Flow
fertility, F, and D appear to be causally linked with the statistically
stronger relationship running from F to D (a one—unit increase in Ft lowers

D+3 by —0.11; while a one—unit increase in Dt is estimated to raise F+3
by the tiny amount +0.35 (on a mean of 108.0)). Whereas the stock
fertility measure F25 did show causality in the short time period (see
Panel A), it did not do so in the fifty—year period with the three—year
lag; only when the six—year lags were included did evidence of causation
from F25 to D emerge.

To recap, regarding the six hypothesized directions of causation
suggested on page 2, at a 95 percent level of confidence we find evidence

that'LF —G-) D, both using LF and LF3O; LF

F but not so using

the age—specific variables; and we find F —2-9 D when we use F25 and
when we consider a fifty—year time span. Diagrammatically,

at

a lower level of confidence (ci =

.10) do we observe any feedback

effect of F —?j4 LF (and an anomalous weak positive effect of D on F in
the fifty—year period).

IV. The Effect of Income
As an extension of the procedures employed above, income is added to
the set of variables and causal links between income and each of the three

socioeconomic variables D, LF, and F are investigated. At the risk of
considerable over—simplification of the existing literature, the following
diagram suggests the directions of effects typically hypothesized in the

literature regarding men's income, I, holding women's income (or wage
rates) fixed (I

)

and the hypothesized effects of women's income,

In If

That is, men's income is expected to be negatively related to divorce
rates as cross—sectional evidence suggests. The positive income elasticity of leisure accounts for the negative relationship between I and
LFPR of women, and for various reasons (see either Willis (page 40) or

Becker—Lewis (p. 83) in Schultz (1974)), the observed effect of I on F
may be negative even though the "true" income elasticity for children is

expected to be positive. The effects for I simply reflect the hypothesized effects for LF which were discussed above.

12

Two measures of annual income are used here: I is defined as median

m

real income of men age 14 and over and I is defined as real per capita

income.

7

.

While I is a reasonably adequate measure of men s income, I

is not a measure of I• Instead changes in I reflect both changes in
men's income and changes in I and additionally, I is inversely affected
by changes in fertility. Moreover, while the relationships diagrammed in
the previous paragraph are partial effects, the results to which we now

turn do not "hold constant" the other source of income. Table 4 shows
the tests of causation between each pair of variables using both I and I

as a measure of income.8 The findings are summarized as follows:

I-LF

'mLF

The results for I do in fact generally mirror the results reported above
for LF in terms of the effects on D and F, although the reverse effect

of F on I may be reflecting the definitional relationship between a decline
in fertility and consequent rise in per capita income rather than any
behavioral relationship from fewer children to increased labor market

activity by women (the effect is small in any case). The comparison of

results for I and 1 are interesting: although I exhibits a positive
and significant effect on D, the effect is far smaller than that of I. If
were tested holding I or LF constant, one might expect that significant positive effect to disappear. In fact that is what is found:
?

extending these tests of causation to test I -

LF -

DIDI

and

13

similarly for I in place of I, none of the four F—tests is statistically

significant. While LF an I have strong positive effects on D, and I has
a much smaller, positive effect on D, none of the partial effects is sig-

nificant.9

Summary

The causation tests performed here are neutral with respect to which
series might have exhibited causally prior influence on the other series.
The results suggest that income——measured as either real per capita dispos-

able income, I, or real median income of adult men, I,——is an important
causally prior force affecting the divorce rate and fertility behavior.
Likewise the LFPR of married women (with spouse and young children present)
is causally prior to the divorce rate and fertility, at a 95 percent level

of confidence. There is not a discernible degree of feedback causation
from divorce to either income or LFPR (of married women) nor from fertility

to men's income. There is evidence at a 90 percent level of confidence
of causation from fertility to married women's LFPR and to I, a measure of

per capita income which includes the income of women. The relationship from
fertility to LFPR was, surprisingly, not confirmed when a measure of

stock fertility was used but stock fertility (total number of children
born per woman aged 25) did appear to have a causal effect on divorce.

Regarding the relationship between LFPR and fertility, the results
suggest that when aggregate flow measures are used, the causation from
women's LFPR to fertility is strong and negative while the reverse causa-

tion is present, negative but quite weak. A similar conclusion was reached
in a recent sociological study using young women's stated intentions about
their completed—fertility and their planned labor force participation at a

14

10
later age (age 35).

Regarding divorce and fertility no causal influence

is seen in the post—war period when flow measures are used, but when a
stock measure of fertility (to young women, age 25) is used instead,
causation from fertility to divorce is found.

Although income and labor force participation rates of married women
appear to be causally prior to fertility and divorce, neither has a statis-

tically significant partial effect when the other is controlled for. It
appears that the behavior of phenomena which are the more traditional areas
of concern to economists——income and labor market changes——influence socioeconomic phenomena such as fertility and divorce more than vice versa,

based on tests using a short—run lag in the post—World War II era. The
investigation reported here does not, obviously, address the issue of much
longer run feedback (as for example the effect of cohort size on wages).
Many limitations in the analysis performed here seem quite apparent.
(1) The results appear to be sensitive to the filtering process employed,
but the weak results using Box—Jenkins are not quantitatively different
among this set of socioeconomic variables than is found in the mini—growth
industry of estimating causal relationships among macro—economic time

series. The results are also sensitive to the particular measure used of,
say, income or fertility, but that is neither surprising nor intellectually

troublesome. The results using the third estimation scheme seem to be
Consistent with what might be expected when one measure or another of, say,
fertility is used.

(2) Another issue is that the relationships estimated

here are not structural in any sense. From the few checks which have been
made the estimated equations do not exhibit a dampening effect over time of

an initial shock from one series. However, the directions of effects are

15

as expected: an increase in LFPR, for example, raises the divorce rate
and lowers fertility; a rise in fertility lowers LFPR; a rise in income
per capita (dominated by the rise in women's income) raises divorce while
a rise in men's income (which is correlated with the rise in women's
income) raises divorce but by much less.
(3) The tests of causation performed here involve essentially leads

and lags. But there are differences among these time series phenomena
In the inherent lags between a behavioral decision and its evidence in the

measured variable. For example, if at the same moment in time an individual
decided to enter the labor force, bear a child, and divorce (an unlikely
event, but useful for illustration here), those events would not show up as

contemporaneous events in the measured statistics: the decision at t = 0
would likely be observed in LF0, F1, and, depending upon the complications
of the relevant divorce laws, in D1 or D2. So the natural leads and lags
in the measured series confound the interpretations of causation.

Finally, the set of four variables chosen for analysis here is surely
no more than a very partial set of the variables one might want to
include——marriage, remarriage, schooling and migration behavior and unem—

ploytnent rates seem likely candidates to incorporate. The analysis to
date may, however, serve to illustrate that the time series techniques
used with increasing frequency in another area can be as fruitfully
applied to time series in sociological economics as in traditional macroeconomics.

1. For example, see Bane (1976), Bronfenbrenner (1974), Easterlin,
Wachter and Wachter (1977), Kobrin (1976), Ross, Sawhill (1975),
Ryder (1974), et. al. The generally positive relationship between
women's labor force participation rate and the divorce rate is explained in terms of the greater independence provided women by
improved labor market opportunities, an independence which lowers
the attractiveness of marriage and thus encourages divorce. Alternatively, the growing acceptance of divorce increases its likelihood
which induces women to secure for themselves market careers that lower
their dependence on their spouses.
Likewise, the negative relationship between fertility and labor force
participation rates of women is explained in terms of the higher value
of women's time caused by improved labor market opportunities for
women. This higher value of time in the labor market has induced
women to substitute more of their time toward market activities and
away from child rearing.

2. Equation (1) can be written for X, Yt_' t—2, and Yt—3 with inter-

for n=3 in all cases.
Then writing equation (2) with the summation over the periods t—3, t—2, an
t—l for testing causation from Y to X, we can substitute into equation (2)
for the terms X, Y51,
Y_ from equation (1) yielding the form

Here Sims' point about the downward

bias imposed by the Box—Jenkins filtering is clear——that filtering
estimates the 's first and then in a second stage, estimates the b's,
yielding generally biased estimates of the b's (see Sims (1977), p. 24).

3. For convenience Table 1 includes the Box—Jenkins analysis of the income
series described and used in the following section.
Regarding the interpretation of Table 1, the fertility series for
example is characterized as a first—difference, first—order moving
average process, (F_Ft_1) = —0.459 + O.63lut_l + Ut with the residual
series as white noise when judged by the Box and Pierce x2 test. Each
of the residual series from Table 1 can be considered serially uncor—
related through at least a lag of 12 years.
As the implementation of this empirical technique is seemingly as much
art as science, I am not certain that the ARIMA structure used here is

F—2

preciselY that which another practitioner would adopt. However, some
comparisons of the resulting residual series have convinced me that
the use of another, similar ARIMA structure would not have appreciably
affected the results——for example, for the divorce rate series, the
simple correlations of the whitened series from an ARIMA (111) or
ARIMA (212) with the series used here are 0.93 and 0.99 respectively
and they are intercorrelated at the level of 0.96.

4. After filtering the series, serial correlation coefficients r for
lags of 1, 2 and 3 were computed and the Box—Pierce Chi—squared test
of significance,
3

N r =
t=l
with N = number of observations, e.g. years, and degree of freedom
k—p (3 lags minus 2 parameters = 1) was calculated. The x2 value
for divorce, fertility, and labor force respectively were 2.87, 0.73,
and 9.58 with x(c. = 0.05) = 3.84; so the labor force series showed
significant serial correlation remaining in the first three lags.
5. In order to estimate equation (3), one must remove the correlation
between X_1 and et which exists if there is autocorrelation in the
residuals. This is done by the use of instrumental variables. A
four—equation scheme is employed. First, instruments for each of the
three variables D, LF, and F were obtained by regression of each
separately on a set of auxiliary variables: marriage duration, unemployment, a measure of women's education level and a proxy for the
available contraceptive technology._ These regressions, run on annual
data from 1947 or 1948 to 1974hadR2's of around .90 and yielded
instruments for each year for D, LF, and F.
Second, the regression of interest is estimated employing the instru=
ments in place of the stochastic LHS—lagged regressors, e.g., Dt
et
f(Dt_l, Dt_2, Dt_3, Ft_l, Ft_2, Ft—3) + et. Third, the residuals
were used to estimate the first—order autocorrelation by regressing
et = a + b et_l + ut where b= p. Then a modified first difference
— pDt_2),
equation was estimated, (Dt—pD_1) = f(Dt_l
(Ft_l—pFt_2), ... +

6. The simple correlation between F and F25 for the period 1924—1974
is .615. The age—specific annual time series for 1950—1974 are:
children ever born to women age 25;
F25:
p = 1.44, a = 0.20.
LF3O: LFPR of women age 25—34; p = 39.8, a = 5.9.
The annual time series for 1924—1974 include:
3.1
D: p = 10.3, a
a
=
16.0
1: p = 96.5,
F25: p = 1.21, a = 0.26

F— 3

7. The simple correlation in the post—war period between I and
is 0.98. The mean and standard deviation of I and 'm are respectively:
= 2.57, a = 0.43; and ii = 4.89, a = 0.77.
8. The Box—Jenkins and single—filter procedures were also applied to I,
although these results are not shown in Table 4. Neither procedure
showed causation from I to any of the three socioeconomic variables.
The only significant F—test was the test on feedback from fertility
to income: the Box—Jenkins filter yielded an F—statistic of 3.30,
significant at a. = .10. This same weak effect is exhibited in Table 4
using the other procedure.

9. In these tests equation (3) is estimated in an expanded form where
D is regressed on D, LF and I (or on D, LF and 1m)' all lagged three
years; the partial F—tests for LF and I are then computed. The
results were as follows:

Test

.10 is 2.52 so none of these partial
effects is statistically significant. Thus while we can say that I,
or LF "causes" D, the interpretation of that finding is in doubt.
It appears that the causally prior variable represents some causally
prior force but either I or LF reflects that force as well as the
other. So we have not identified in the laymen's sense what "causes"
divorce, we have only identified three separate series which are
independently causally prior.
The critical value of F at a. =

10. Waite and Stolzenberg (1976) use the young women's National Longitudinal Survey data to estimate a simultaneous equations model and
found planned LFPR a relatively strong influence on planned fertility
(plans to be in the labor force lowered planned fertility by 0.8
children (on a mean of 2.4 children)) while the reverse relationship
was statistically significant but quite small (plans for one more
child lowered the implicit probability of planned LFPR by only 3.2
percentage points (on a mean of 48. percent).
