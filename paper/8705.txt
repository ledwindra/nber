When Do Firms Shift Production Across States to Avoid Environmental Regulation?

January 2002, Revised September 2007
JEL No. D2,Q2
ABSTRACT
This paper takes a new approach to testing the impact of state environmental regulatory stringency
on firms' location decisions, focusing on firms' allocation of production across states. We use Census
data for the paper industry to measure the share of each firm's production in each state during 1967-2002.
We use a conditional logit model, controlling for a variety of state characteristics that influence firm
costs and revenues, and testing several measures of state environmental stringency. Firms allocate
significantly smaller production shares to states with stricter regulations, but there is significant heterogeneity
across firms in their sensitivity to regulatory stringency. Firms with low compliance rates are more
sensitive than firms with high compliance rates, consistent with a model where compliance rates are
driven by differences across firms in the costs of compliance, rather than in the benefits of compliance.

1. Introduction
Environmental regulation in the U.S. has a decidedly federal nature, with state regulatory
agencies responsible for much of the enforcement activity, along with some setting of standards.
Different states, facing different benefits and costs from environmental regulation, might be
expected to choose different levels of stringency, imposing different abatement costs. In turn,
firms might respond to differences in costs by shifting their operations, opening or expanding
plants in less stringent states, and closing or reducing their operations in stricter states.
We examine the impact of regulatory stringency on firms’ allocation of their production
across different states, measured by the share of a firm’s total production occurring in each state.
This is (to our knowledge) the first examination of this topic. Existing studies of regulatory
impact using plant-level data have tended to focus on discrete decisions: plant openings and
closings. Bartik (1988), McConnell and Schwab (1990), and Levinson (1996) found relatively
small or insignificant impacts, but more recent studies have found larger impacts. For example,
Becker and Henderson (2000) found large reductions in the number of new plants opening in
counties with stricter regulation, as did List, et. al. (2003). Furthermore, Gray (1997) found
lower birth rates of new plants in states with stricter regulation, and Deily and Gray (1991) found
that steel mills facing more stringent regulatory enforcement were more likely to close. Finally,
Greenstone (2002) a paper much closer in spirit to the our paper, finds significant reductions in
economic activity of polluting plants in higher-stringency counties, but doesn’t consider the
firm-level aspect of the decision.
In addition to being novel, examining shifts in production shares is quantitatively
important. In our data, changes in production at existing plants account for two-thirds of the
1

aggregate changes in firms’ production shares over time, while plant openings and closings
account for only about one-sixth each. It is not obvious whether differences in environmental
regulation should affect production shares more than they affect plant openings and closings. On
the one hand, shifting production among existing plants may be easier than opening or closing
plants, making such shifts more sensitive to differences in regulation. On the other hand, many
regulations, such as new source performance review, tend to be stricter for new plants and
exempt existing ones due to grandfathering, possibly making existing plants less affected by
differences in regulation than new plants.
We use eight years of plant-level Census year data (1967-2002) for the pulp and paper
industry from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database. The data set includes firm
identifiers, allowing us to calculate the share that each state represents in a firm's shipments. We
also use information on each firm's compliance status from EPA regulatory databases to see
whether more compliant firms are more or less sensitive to state regulatory differences. We also
control for other state characteristics are included that could influence production allocation,
such as factor prices and quality, industry concentration, and product demand.
We find a significant relationship between regulatory stringency and production
allocation. States with stricter regulations have smaller production shares, even after controlling
for a variety of other state characteristics. This impact is concentrated in firms with low levels of
compliance with environmental regulations. If anything, firms with high compliance rates tend to
prefer more stringent states, though this effect is relatively small. These results are consistent
with a model where differences across firms in compliance rates are driven primarily by
differences in compliance costs (e.g. economies of scale in compliance), rather than by
differences in the benefits of compliance (e.g. maintaining the firm's reputation). Briefly, if
2

firms choose low compliance rates because they see few benefits from complying, they would
have no need to avoid high-stringency states. If, instead, low-compliance firms would like to
comply, but don’t because it is too costly, they would avoid high-stringency states - which is
what we observe.
Section 2 presents the theoretical and econometric models we use in analyzing the firm's
decision to allocate its production across states. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents
the results, followed by our conclusions and some thoughts for future research in Section 5.

2. Model
State regulatory stringency may influence firms' decisions along many dimensions. The
usual assumption is that production costs are higher in stricter states where firms are required to
meet tougher emissions standards, install higher-capacity (more expensive) pollution control
equipment, incur higher operating costs, and perform more frequent maintenance.1 In addition to
higher production costs, more stringent states may have more complex permit procedures,
requiring firms to undertake lengthy negotiations whenever they wish to change their production
process, and perhaps imposing uncertainty about whether the changes will be permitted at all.
Since these permits are commonly required when opening a new plant, there could also be a
direct impact of regulatory stringency on the expenses or time required to open a new plant.2

1

Becker (2005) demonstrates the connection between regulatory stringency and pollution abatement
costs. Other studies have measured regulation-induced increases in costs as decreases in productivity.
Fare et al (1989), Gray (1987), and Barbera and McConnell (1986) use industry-level data. In plant-level
work, Gollop and Roberts (1983) study electric utilities, while Berman and Bui (2001), Boyd and
McClelland (1999), and Gray and Shadbegian (2002,2003) examine manufacturing plants.
2

The importance of permit uncertainty in the paper industry is discussed in Gray and Shadbegian (1998).
We have no direct measures of permit difficulties, but conversations with industry people suggest that
states which are stricter on our regulatory stringency measures are likely to have more delays and
3

In addition to the overall impact of regulatory stringency on firms’ decisions, we are also
interested in heterogeneity across firms in their decisions. For example, we observe variations in
regulatory compliance across firms, with larger firms serving national markets having better
environmental performance (being more often in compliance with regulations) than smaller firms
serving local markets. Why might such differences occur?
Differences in compliance between large and small firms could arise from differences in
their costs of dealing with the complexity of environmental regulations. Larger firms can afford
a corporate environmental staff supporting many plants. Smaller firms, relying on plant-level
personnel with many other responsibilities, cannot keep up with frequent regulatory changes.3
Larger firms may also have the political clout to intervene in the standards-setting process,
making compliance easier.4 These economies of scale in compliance should give larger firms an
advantage, especially in states with stringent regulations (and more complex bureaucratic
procedures to enforce those regulations), allowing them to choose higher compliance rates.
Differences across firms in compliance could also arise from differences in their benefits
of compliance, attributable to the importance of reputation, both in terms of reputation with
regulatory agencies and with customers. Failure to comply with regulations may result in lost
sales, if customers value a ‘green’ image for the products they consume. Regulators may punish

uncertainty in their permitting process.
3

These differences may be growing smaller over time (though we do not test for that here). Down-sizing
and cost-cutting pressures at large corporations have reduced the size of corporate staffs, and there has
been greater use of outside consultants specializing in environmental issues, providing smaller firms with
access to some scale economies. These trends have been more pronounced in recent years, so should be
less important for the period being studied here.
4

Environmental officers at large corporations commonly serve on state environmental advisory boards,
where they are in a position to influence the development of new regulations.

violators with stricter future enforcement at all plants owned by the firm (see Harrington (1988)).
In both cases, the importance of reputation relies on non-compliant behavior being highly
visible, and on there being a large number of future interactions where the punishment can take
place. Smaller firms have fewer other plants or future sales to be punished, and their violations
are likely to be less newsworthy. Therefore smaller firms should face smaller benefits from
compliance, leading them to choose lower levels of compliance effort.
Now consider the optimizing decision of a profit-maximizing firm choosing its
production level Qs in each of a number of different states, as shown in Equation 1 below.
R(Qs) and C(Qs) refer to the revenue function (net of transportation costs to consumers, possibly
located in other states) and production cost function in state s. We assume that over the relevant
range of output the revenue and cost functions have the usual shape – diminishing marginal
revenue (d2R(Qs)/dQs2<0) and increasing marginal costs (d2C(Qs)/dQs2>0). We also assume
that production of Q causes pollution and the firm is faced with a choice about how much of its
pollution to abate, As (0<=As<=1), with resulting abatement costs PAC(As). We further assume
increasing marginal abatement costs (d2PACs/dAs2>0). On the other hand, not abating pollution
can also be costly, as the firm faces expected penalties Ps from state regulators, where Ps
depends on both inspection frequency and the level of penalties for violations. Note that both
abatement costs and penalties are measured proportional to output. The model allows for
heterogeneity across firms in both costs of abatement αc (e.g. economies of scale in abatement)
and benefits from abatement αb (e.g. “penalties” from customer backlash if the firm is found in
violation).

(1) Max Π = R(Qs) - C(Qs) - αc*PAC(As)*Qs - αb*Ps*(1-As)*Qs
5

Qs, As
The profit-maximizing firm chooses both the optimal level of output (Qs*) and the
optimal level of abatement (As*) in each state. The first-order condition for choosing Qs* is
shown in Equation 2, where the usual equality between marginal revenue and marginal cost
(R’=C’) is complicated by an additional wedge, based on a combination of the cost of pollution
abatement and the penalties from non-abatement. The first-order condition for choosing As* is
shown in Equation 3, where the firm sets its marginal abatement cost equal to its expected
penalties from not abating pollution, adjusted by the firm-specific factors αc and αb.

(2) R’(Qs*) = C’(Qs*) + αc*PAC(As*) + αb*Ps*(1-As*)
(3) PAC’(As*) = (αb / αc)*Ps

With constant or declining marginal costs of production and no transportation costs, a
profit-maximizing firm should produce all its output in the lowest-cost state, taking into account
pollution-related cost differences. Since we are analyzing data for firms that produced output in
at least four different states, they must have either increasing marginal production costs or
transportation costs, in order to have an interior solution to Equation 2 in multiple states. Firms
will tend to produce less in those states with higher regulatory stringency: all else equal, higher
Ps in a state encourages a greater abatement effort (As), both combining to create a larger wedge
between marginal revenue and marginal cost. In the extreme, firms may choose to produce
nothing in states with sufficiently high regulatory stringency.
We are also interested in differences across firms in their sensitivity to state regulatory
6

stringency, dQs*/dPs. These differences could arise from differences in the firms’ αc or αb. We
don’t observe αc and αb, but we do observe the firm’s level of regulatory compliance, which we
take as an indicator of its average abatement decisions. Suppose that differences in compliance
across firms are driven by differences in their αc. High-compliance firms would be those with
lower αc and a smaller wedge, and thus would be less sensitive to regulatory stringency. If,
instead, differences across firms in compliance are driven by differences in their αb, highcompliance firms would be those with higher αb and a larger wedge, and thus would be more
sensitive to regulatory stringency.
We can see this more simply by considering the extreme cases, where αc=0 or αb=0. If
αc=0, then it is costless for the firm to abate, so it sets As*=1 and the wedge disappears. In this
case, differences in Ps have no effect on high-compliance firms. On the other hand, if αb=0, then
the firm sees no benefit from abatement, so it sets As*=0. Again the wedge disappears, but now
it is low-compliance firms that are unaffected by differences in Ps. In our empirical work, we
interact the firm’s overall compliance rate with a measure of state regulatory stringency. Based
on the argument above, a positive coefficient on the interaction term indicates that differences in
the costs of pollution abatement are the more important source of firm heterogeneity: higher firm
compliance reduces the negative impact of state stringency on production within the state. A
negative coefficient indicates that differences in benefits are more important.
We use a conditional logit model for the analysis, examining the probability that a firm
allocates a given unit of production to a given state, given the characteristics of that state and all
the other available states to choose from:

7

(4) Prob( firm i chooses state s ) =

exp( β ∗ Z s + δ ∗ Ps + γ ∗ Ai ∗ Ps )
.
∏ exp(β ∗ Z j + δ ∗ Pj + γ ∗ Ai ∗ Pj )
j

State characteristics Zs include the cost of labor and other inputs, along with factors that might
influence marginal revenue, such as industry concentration and an index of product demand
within the state. Following this model focuses our attention on the differences in regulation (and
other explanatory variables) across states at a given time. A general increase in regulatory
stringency across all states could leave the ratio in equation (2) unchanged, in which case it
would be predicted not to influence the firm’s allocation decision – every unit of production has
to be allocated somewhere, and it’s differences in P and Z across states which matter in the
conditional logit model.
Firm characteristics cannot directly enter the model, since they would cancel out in the
numerator and denominator of (2), but we interact our measures of regulatory stringency with the
firm’s compliance rate, to see whether low-compliance firms respond more or less to regulatory
differences. We use the fraction of all of the firm’s plants that are in compliance, based on all
plant-year observations with compliance data, so each firm has one compliance rate, fixed over
time. This is intended to capture differences across firms in their long-term compliance
tendencies.5 We consider two types of interactions, one using the continuous measure of
compliance and the other using a spline in compliance to see how responsiveness changes as
compliance rates change.

5

Comments on an earlier version suggested concerns about possible endogeneity of compliance. This
seems less relevant in the conditional logit model, but we did test instrumenting for the firm compliance
rate, modeling plant-level compliance for the firm’s plants based on plant age and output, state regulatory
enforcement, and state and year dummies, with essentially identical results (available from the authors).
8

The model doesn’t allow us to differentiate shifts in production across existing plants
from shifts due to plant openings and plant closings. We might expect shifting production
among existing plants to be easier than opening new plants, since new plants are generally
subject to more stringent regulations. However, air pollution regulations requiring stricter rules
for new plants (New Source Performance Standards) can also require existing plants to be treated
as new if they substantially expand their production process. This could make production shifts
among existing plants more costly. In any event, our estimated effects are best thought of as
averages across the different categories of changing production shares, weighted by their relative
sizes.
To implement our model using a standard conditional logit routine, we treat each firm as
making 100 decisions in each time period, allocating 100 ‘percentage points’ of its production
across the available states. The estimation routine interprets this as generating a huge sample
size for the analysis, with correspondingly small standard errors and large t-statistics – but the
impact is predictable, so we can adjust for it.6 The key is to decide what the “true” sample size
is, from which the appropriate adjustment factor can be calculated and applied. In our analyses
we use the actual number of firm-state observations with positive production. This should be a
conservative measure of sample size, since it excludes any states where the firm is not currently
producing.

6

For example, doubling the sample size (allocating 200 rather than 100 shares of production) would
double the log-likelihood and reduce all standard errors by the square root of 2, but has no effect on the
estimated coefficients.

3. Data
Our basic plant-level data on production comes from the Longitudinal Research Database
(LRD) maintained at the Center for Economic Studies of the Census Bureau (see McGuckin and
Pascoe (1988) for a detailed description). We use information from the Census of Manufactures,
done every five years since 1967 on all manufacturing plants in the country (around 300,000
plants in each census). For this paper, we concentrate on pulp and paper mills, which we have
studied extensively, including an analysis of the impact of pollution abatement costs on
productivity (Gray and Shadbegian (2002) and Shadbegian and Gray (2005)). The plant-level
data includes a firm identifier, with which we link together all the paper mills owned by the same
firm in each Census year from 1967-2002.
We add up the total value of shipments from each plant owned by the firm and calculate
the share of a firm's production arising in each state, which forms the dependent variable
(SHTVS) for our analysis.7 In order to focus on those firms which are in a position to allocate
production across states, we limit our sample to those firms which produced in at least four
different states at some point. This would give us a ‘balanced’ panel, if all firms were in
business throughout the period. A few of our firms are out of existence at some point
(corresponding to the birth or death of the entire firm). We drop those firm-year observations
since their production shares cannot be defined in that year, but keep them in the sample for the
other years.
In what ways do firms shift production in our data? Changes in production shares at

7

We could calculate plant-level production shares, but all of our explanatory variables are statespecific, so we use state-level shares instead.
10

continuing plants accounted for 68 percent of all share changes, while plant openings accounted
for 17 percent and closings for 15 percent. Thus changes in production shares at existing plants
are about four times as important as plant openings or closings in terms of moving production
activity across plants in different states.
Does it make sense to treat the market as being served by plants in many different states?
The 1993 Commodity Flow Survey reports the distance traveled by shipments for particular
industries. Based on these data, paper shipments traveled an average of 238 miles, with 26
percent of shipments traveling further than 500 miles.8 This indicates a somewhat national
market for paper, with opportunities to shift production across states, but not a market in which
firms are concentrating all their production in one or a few states.
As noted earlier, firms' decisions about whether or not to comply with regulations may
provide some information about their sensitivity to regulatory costs. We use plant-level air
pollution compliance data for 1979-1989 taken from the EPA's Compliance Data System, where
compliance is defined as not being ‘in violation’ for any pollutant at any point during the year.
All of the available plant-years of compliance data were linked together by firm, and the 'firm
compliance average' was calculated as the fraction of all observations in compliance.9 We use a
single compliance measure for each firm (not a time-varying one) because the compliance data is
not consistently available before the 1980s. Using a single compliance measure is appropriate as
long as differences in compliance primarily reflect long-run differences between firms, rather
8 Calculations done by the author, using the publicly available 1993 Commodity Flow Survey on CD-

ROM. The details of this analysis (aggregating data for specific state-industry cells on the average
shipment distance and the frequency distribution of shipments for different categories of distances) are
available from the author. The averaging is done based on each shipment's value.
9

We originally compiled the CDS information for our productivity analyses, so the compliance
variable is only available for firms which had at least one plant in our productivity sample.
11

than transitory fluctuations.
Aside from the firm compliance variable and firm and year dummies, all of the
explanatory variables in our model are state-specific. These range from state-level regulatory
variables to input cost and other factors expected to influence the production decision. In earlier
plant-location analyses (Gray (1997)) the issue of endogeneity of these explanatory variables
arose, and was addressed in part by lagging the explanatory variables by five years. Thus 1977
explanatory variables are assumed to influence the birth rate of new plants between 1977 and
1982. We use a similar procedure here, so that 1977 explanatory variables are used to explain
production shares in 1982.
The state-level regulatory data comes from a variety of sources. One problem with our
regulatory measures is that they tend not to be available before the 1980s, and often have no
time-series variation available at all. Our principle index of regulatory stringency does have
some time-series variation: support for environmental legislation in Congress. The League of
Conservation Voters calculates a scorecard for each member of Congress on environmental
issues, with data available back to the early 1970s. We use the average score for the state's
House of Representative members (VOTE) in our analysis.10
The Census Bureau's Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey
reports the dollars spent for pollution abatement by manufacturing firms, giving totals for all
industries in each state and for all plants nationwide in each industry. We divide annual
pollution abatement operating costs by total manufacturing shipments to measure pollution
10

The earliest year available in the League of Conservation Voters data is 1970. We calculated
comparable measures for the 1960s, using congressional voting data on environment-related legislation in
the 1960s. Of course the environmental bills being considered in the 1960s were fewer and less costly
than those in later years, but the votes should reflect similar differences in state preferences for regulation.
12

abatement intensity (for each state and each industry). We then calculate the predicted
abatement intensity for each state, multiplying each industry's abatement intensity by its share in
total state employment (from the Census of Manufactures). The residual abatement intensity
(actual minus predicted), is used in the regressions (PAOCADJ). The survey was first done in
1973, and the 1973 values are used for all years of data before 1973. This is equivalent to
assuming that the relative rankings of the states were unchanged before 1973 and allowing the
year dummies in the regressions to control for the expected (but unmeasured) tendency towards
lower expenditures before 1973.
The Green Index publication (Hall and Kerr 1991) contains one-time rankings of all the
states on a large number of environmental-related variables. A measure of regulatory stringency
is the ‘Green Policies’ (ENVPOLICY) index, designed to measure the stringency of state
environmental regulations based on a set of 77 specific indicators, such as the presence of state
laws on specific topics such as recycling. A measure of environmental problems in each state is
the 'Green Conditions' (DIRTY) index, which indicates the state's combined ranking on over 100
measures of the quality of the state's environment, including air and water pollution
information.11 CONVMEMB (taken from the same source) is the number of members of three
conservation groups (Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and National Wildlife Federation) per 1000 in the
state population, indicating support for environmental issues among the state's electorate.
REGSPEND is the dollars per capita spent on the state's programs for environmental and natural
resources in 1988 (Council of State Governments (1991)).

11

The original rankings were designed so that low scores reflected stricter regulation and a cleaner
environment. Since all other stringency measures use higher values to indicate stricter regulation, we
multiplied the Green Policies index by -1 to improve comparability.
13

A direct measure of enforcement activity for air pollution regulation is taken from the
EPA's Compliance Data System. This database reports all air pollution inspections, identifying
the affected plant by industry and location. The total number of inspections of manufacturing
plants between 1984 and 1987, divided by the number of manufacturing plants in 1982, was
calculated for each state (AIRINSP). Greater enforcement activity is expected to put more
pressure on plants in the state to come into compliance with air pollution regulations, raising
costs and reducing profitability. In Deily and Gray (1991) a similar measure of enforcement was
found to increase the probability that a steel plant would close.
One final regulatory variable (NONATTAIN) measures the state's attainment status for
key pollutants. We select a single air pollutant that is particularly relevant for the paper industry
(particulates), and calculate the fraction of the counties in the state that are not in attainment.12 A
high value should be associated with more regulation, as dirtier air calls for more restrictions on
plant expansion or new plant construction.
We also create a few variables measuring the characteristics of the industry in each state.
DEMAND is a state-specific demand index for paper in the state. We use data on employment
for each one-digit industry in the state, and combine it with data from the 1982 input-output
tables on how much paper each one-digit industry consumes (per employee). To capture ‘final
demand’ for paper by consumers, we use the state's total income and calculated final demand per
dollar of total state income. Adding up the industry and consumer demand for paper gives an
indicator of total demand in the state. It only captures shifts in within-state demand; to the extent
that the market is national or regional in scope, this local demand index may be less important.

12

We would like to thank Randy Becker for providing this attainment data.
14

HERF is the Herfindahl index for plants in the state, measuring how concentrated the
production of paper is in the state. We identify all plants in the industry in each Census year,
add up their individual shipments, and calculate a share of each plant in the total shipments.
Finally, we square each plant's share and sum them. A number close to one indicates highly
concentrated production, while numbers near zero indicate little concentration. To the extent
that a more concentrated industry has more market power, it could raise price in response to
stricter regulations, so may be less sensitive to regulatory pressures. Of course, an ideal measure
of such concentration would be firm-level, rather than plant-level, and might include plants in
nearby states that supplied the same market.
CLOUT is paper industry shipments from plants in the state, divided by the total gross
state product. A large industry might be expected to have more political power, and thus to be
able to gain exemptions from regulatory pressures. On the other hand, a large industry is likely
to be a larger contributor to the total pollution problem in the state, and may be a more visible
target for stricter regulatory pressures. CLOUT should get a positive coefficient, reflecting
whatever characteristics make the state a desirable location.
In addition to the regulatory variables, a number of other variables are used to control for
differences across states that might influence production allocation. These variables were used
in earlier work focussing on plant location, Gray (1997), and were designed to capture a wide
range of the other factors affecting the location decision. The earlier work found them to be
generally significant as a group, although only a subset would be individually significant in any
given regression. Factor price measures include ENERGYPRI (dollars per million BTU, from
the Energy Information Administration), LANDPRICE (value per acre of agricultural land and
buildings, from the City and County Databook), and WAGE (average hourly wage in
15

manufacturing, taken from the Statistical Abstract). All dollar values are converted to real 1982
values using the GDP deflator. Labor market indicators include UNION (percent of nonagricultural workforce unionized, from Bureau of Labor Statistics), UNEMP (civilian
unemployment rate), and INCOME (income per capita). Labor quality is measured by the
fraction of the over-25 population with college degrees (COLLEDUC). Tax differences are
measured by state and local taxes, divided by gross state product (TAXGSP). ELECDEM is the
percentage of votes for Democratic candidates in the U.S. House of Representatives for the state.
Population density (POPDEN) controls for differences in the size of the local product market
and possibly also for ‘agglomeration effects’ (the tendency to locate where existing businesses
are already located). AREA provides a physical measure of the extent of the available market in
the state.

4. Results
Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations for each variable used in the analysis.
In our data, the average paper firm is operating in about 15 states, resulting in an average of
about 6-7 percent of the firm’s production occurring in each state (or alternatively a probability
of about 6-7 percent that any given unit of the firm’s production occurs in that state). We have
about 40 firms in our sample and 7 years of data, resulting in a sample size of 3574 firm-state
observations with non-zero production. Most firms have relatively high compliance rates,
averaging around 70 percent of their plants in compliance.
Table 2 presents the basic models, using the conditional logit model described earlier.
The model explains 10-15 percent of the variation in production allocation across our firm-state
observations, once state characteristics or state dummies are included in the model. Consider
16

model 3, which includes state characteristics but not state dummies. The DEMAND index, as
expected, shows that higher state demand for the industry’s product is associated with greater
production in the state; CLOUT is also positive. ENERGYPRI and WAGE have the expected
significant negative impact on production shares: states with higher energy prices and a higher
wages are allocated lower production shares. COLLEDUC has the expected positive effect on
production shares, though it is only marginally significant. On the other hand, several variables
have unexpected effects, and some of them are significant in model 3, such as LANDPRICE,
TAXGSP, and ELECDEM. Not surprisingly, including state dummy variables in model 4 raises
the overall explanatory power of the model, but reduces the significance of most of the state
characteristics. In fact, DIRTY and AREA drop out of the model when the state dummies are
included, since they are purely cross-sectional variables.
The main focus of this study is on state regulatory stringency, as measured by VOTE, and
its interaction with firm compliance rates. The VOTE variable is consistently negative and
significant, while the interaction between compliance and stringency (COMP*VOTE) is
consistently positive and significant. This indicates that firms with low compliance rates tend to
avoid states with stricter regulation, but that the effect is smaller for firms with higher
compliance rates. In fact, at a high enough compliance rate, the marginal effect of more
stringency is positive. The ‘crossover’ compliance rate varies from 56-74 percent in the models
with state dummies to 97 percent in the models with state characteristics, but not state dummies.
The average compliance rate in our sample, 70 percent, is near the crossover point of 74, so the
marginal impact of stringency on a typical firm's production allocation is likely to be small.
Still, the results indicate that low-compliance firms are more likely to avoid high-stringency
states, which is consistent with compliance decisions being driven by differences in compliance
17

costs across firms (economies of scale in compliance), rather than differences in benefits
(maintaining firm reputation).
In Table 3 we examine the interaction between the regulatory measures and the firm’s
compliance rate using a less constrained approach, creating dummies for firms with compliance
rates exceeding 70 percent and 85 percent, which correspond very roughly to the median and 75th
percentile of the firm compliance distribution.13 For those models that incorporate state
characteristics, we find that the impact of regulatory stringency on production allocation, as
measured by VOTE, is negative and significant for those firms with less-than-average
compliance rates (below 70 percent). For firms with intermediate compliance rates (between 70
and 85 percent), the impact of regulatory stringency is smaller, but still negative, while those
firms with very high compliance rates (over 85 percent) tend to show a positive impact of
regulatory stringency of production allocation.
Table 4 examines six other measures of state regulatory stringency, along with their
interactions with firm compliance. Because these measures (except PAOCADJ and
NONATTAIN) have no within-state variation, we cannot include state fixed-effects in these
models. We do include the full set of state-specific control variables, which have similar
coefficients (not shown here) to those found in Table 2 (model 3). In the upper panel, most of
the other stringency measures give results similar to VOTE, with a negative coefficient on the
regulatory variable and a positive interaction with firm compliance (only ENVPOL has the
unexpected positive sign on the regulatory variable). Those measures for which both terms are
significant (PAOCADJ, NONPM, and CONVMEMB) have cross-over points for their
13

Due to Census confidentiality restrictions, we cannot report the exact values that correspond to a single
observation in the dataset, such as the median value.
18

compliance rates roughly similar to those found for VOTE, ranging from 54 percent for
PAOCADJ to 97 percent for CONVMEMB.
The results in the lower panel of Table 4 show the interactions of these 6 regulatory
measures with dummies indicating firm compliance rates greater than 70 or 85 percent. The
impacts here are less consistent than those for VOTE in Table 3, but for those regulatory
measures with consistently significant effects in the upper panel, we see that firms with belowaverage compliance are more sensitive to regulation than high-compliance firms. Also, the
highest-compliance firms have consistently positive effects – allocating relatively more
production to those states with more stringent regulation.

5. Conclusions
We examine the decision faced by a firm trying to allocate its production across plants in
several states, based in part on the regulatory stringency in those states. We are able to measure
these decisions between 1967 and 2002, at five year intervals, using the Census Bureau's
Longitudinal Research Database. We focus on paper firms, which face relatively stringent
environmental regulation and have many firms with operations in multiple states.
We find a significant relationship between our regulatory variables and production
allocation within the paper industry. States with stricter regulations have smaller production
shares, even after controlling for a variety of other state characteristics. Interacting firm
compliance and state stringency, we find that the impact of stringency is concentrated on lowcompliance firms. In fact, firms with high compliance rates appear to be slightly more likely to
produce in more stringent states. The crossover points (where state stringency has no impact on
production location), occur between 50 and 80 percent compliance rates, relatively close to the
19

actual compliance rates of about 70 percent in our data.
Our result that high-compliance firms are less likely to avoid more stringent states seems
consistent with compliance decisions being driven by differences in compliance costs across
firms (economies of scale in compliance), rather than differences in benefits (maintaining firm
reputation). If firms are choosing low compliance rates because they do not see any benefits
from complying, they would not need to avoid high-stringency states (since they are not
planning to comply anyway). If the low-compliance firms are trying to comply, but failing due
to high compliance costs, they would want to avoid high-stringency states – consistent with our
results.
We anticipate further work in this area, looking in more detail at changes in allocation
over time and developing a model of a firm's compliance behavior in order to better understand
how regulation affects production allocation decisions.
