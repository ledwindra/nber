Although no synthesis, or a fully coherent theory of policy, has yet emerged from this research, the results have already led to major revisions in views abut the nature of the problems that policy has to deal with. This paper provides a selective survey and discussion of some of the results of recent research with emphasis on their implications for policy.\n\n",
