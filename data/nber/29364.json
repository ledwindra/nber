    "abstract": "\n\nProcess automation reduces racial disparities in credit access through enabling smaller loans, broadening banks\u2019 geographic reach, and removing human biases from decision-making. We document these findings in the context of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a setting where private lenders faced no credit risk but decided which firms to serve. Black-owned firms primarily obtained PPP loans from automated fintech lenders, especially in areas with high racial animus. After traditional banks automated their loan processing procedures, their PPP lending to Black-owned firms increased. Our findings cannot be fully explained by racial differences in loan application behaviors, pre-existing banking relationships, firm performance, or fraud rates.\n\n",
