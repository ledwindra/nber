    "abstract": "\n\nDoes immigration change support for redistribution? We design and conduct large-scale surveys and experiments in six countries to investigate how people perceive immigrants and how these perceptions in\ufb02uence their support for redistribution. We \ufb01nd striking misperceptions about the number and characteristics of immigrants. In all countries, respondents greatly overestimate the total number of immigrants, think immigrants are culturally and religiously more distant from them, and economically weaker\u2013less educated, more unemployed, and more reliant on and favored by government transfers\u2013than they actually are. In the experimental part of our paper, we show that simply making respondents think about immigration before asking questions about redistribution makes them support less redistribution, including actual donations to charities. The perception that immigrants are economically weaker and more likely to take advantage of the welfare system is strongly correlated with lower support for redistribution, much more so than the perceived cultural distance or the perceived share of immigrants. These \ufb01ndings are con\ufb01rmed by further experimental evidence. Information about the true shares and origins of immigrants does not change support for redistribution. An anecdote about a \u201chard working\u201d immigrant has somewhat stronger e\ufb00ects, but is unable to counteract the negative priming e\ufb00ect of making people think about immigration. Our results further suggest that narratives shape people\u2019s views on immigration more deeply than hard facts.\n\n",
