    "abstract": "\n\nExpectations of transfers by central governments incentivize overborrowing by local governments. In this paper, we ask if fiscal rules can reduce overborrowing if central governments cannot commit. We study a model in which the central government\u2019s type is unknown and show that fiscal rules increase overborrowing if the central government\u2019s reputation is low. In contrast, fiscal rules are effective in lowering debt if the central government\u2019s reputation is high. Even when the central government\u2019s reputation is low, binding fiscal rules will arise in the equilibrium of a signaling game.\n\n",
