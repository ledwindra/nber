A Cautionary Tale of Evaluating Identifying Assumptions: Did Reality TV Really Cause a
Decline in Teenage Childbearing?
David A. Jaeger, Theodore J. Joyce, and Robert Kaestner
NBER Working Paper No. 24856
July 2018
JEL No. J13,L82
ABSTRACT
Evaluating policy changes that occur everywhere at the same time is difficult because of the lack
of a clear counterfactual. Hoping to address this problem, researchers often proxy for differential
exposure using some observed characteristic in the pre-treatment period. As a cautionary tale of
how difficult identification is in such settings, we re-examine the results of an influential paper by
Melissa Kearney and Phillip Levine, who found that the MTV program 16 and Pregnant had a
substantial impact on teen birth rates. In what amounts to a difference-in-differences approach,
they use the pre-treatment levels of MTV viewership across media markets as an instrument. We
show that controlling for differential time trends in birth rates by a market’s pre-treatment racial/
ethnic composition or unemployment rate causes Kearney and Levine’s results to disappear,
invalidating the parallel trends assumption necessary for a causal interpretation. Extending the
pre-treatment period and estimating placebo tests, we find evidence of an “effect” long before 16
and Pregnant started broadcasting. Our results highlight the difficulty of drawing causal
inferences from national point-in-time policy changes.

Evaluating policy changes that occur nationally at one point in time is particularly
challenging. Cross-country comparisons are unlikely to be convincing because of institutional and
cultural difference and simple before-and-after comparisons within a country are likely to be
confounded by secular changes over time in the outcome. Finding an appropriate counterfactual
in such cases is daunting and the assumptions necessary for identifying a causal effect should be
thoroughly scrutinized.
One common identification strategy when evaluating a point-in-time change in policy is to
use pre-treatment characteristics of the units under study as a measure of the exposure to the
treatment. These characteristics are often interacted with indicators of time or other variables that
vary over time to create instruments that are used to isolate exogenous variation in the endogenous
variable of interest. The threats to identification are likely to be substantial, however, as the pretreatment characteristics must stratify the units in a way that is orthogonal to any subsequent trends
in the outcome apart from the effect of treatment.
As a cautionary tale of the difficulty of meeting such assumptions, we reexamine the results
of a recent and influential paper by Kearney and Levine (2015b, henceforth KL) that claimed that
the MTV reality shows 16 and Pregnant, Teen Mom, and Teen Mom 2 (henceforth collectively
referred to as 16 and Pregnant) caused a 4.3 percent drop in teen birth rates between July 2009
and December 2010. This effect is large and would account for a quarter of the total reduction in
teen childbearing during this period. KL interpret their estimates as causal and write that “…a
social media campaign in the guise of a very popular reality TV show… adds a new ‘policy mix’”
(p. 3598) to current interventions designed to reduce teen pregnancy.
KL use the audience share watching MTV at a specific time of day in each media market
in the year before 16 and Pregnant began broadcasting, interacted with a post-16 and Pregnant

1

dummy variable as an instrument for the 16 and Pregnant viewership. There is little theoretical
justification for this instrument, however, because MTV viewership is a choice variable that is
likely to be determined by the same demographic and socioeconomic factors that determine 16
and Pregnant viewership. Because the same demographic and socioeconomic factors are likely to
be associated with teen births, it is natural to question the exogeneity of the instrument. KL’s
identification fundamentally relies on comparing changes in teen birth rates before and after 16
and Pregnant in media markets with relatively high- and low-MTV viewership in the year before
the show.
Identification strategies that use fixed unit characteristics (like MTV viewership in the pretreatment period) interacted with something that varies over time (like the post-treatment dummy
variable) are quite common. In another recent example, Nunn and Qian (2014) examine the impact
of U.S. food aid on conflict in recipient countries. They use U.S. wheat production in the period
prior to aid receipt interacted with the fraction of years that a country received any food aid in a
fixed twenty-five-year period to create an instrument for U.S. food aid that varies by country and
time period. Nunn and Qian note explicitly that their identification strategy is a difference-indifferences analysis. In a critique similar to ours about KL, Christian and Barrett (2017) conclude
that the parallel trends assumption inherent in Nunn and Qian’s analysis does not hold.
As noted by Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin, and Swift (2018), KL’s identification strategy is
also related to the use of “Bartik” or shift-share instruments common in the trade literature, and
the literature estimating the impact of immigration on wages and other outcomes, among others.
Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin, and Swift (2018) discuss the general conditions for validity of Bartik
instruments in static contexts, while Jaeger, Ruist, and Stuhler (2018) raise concerns about such
instruments in presence of dynamic adjustment processes, particularly in the immigration

2

literature. All of these studies can be viewed as essentially relying on a difference-in-differences
research design on the basis of pre-treatment characteristics.
KL’s reliance on a variant of the “shift-share” methodology stands in marked contrast to
other studies of the impact of media (Gentzkow 2006, Della Vigna and Kaplan 2007, Gentzkow
and Shapiro 2008, Jensen and Oster 2009, La Ferrara, Chong, and Duryea 2012, Campante and
Hojman 2013, Kearney and Levine 2015a, among others). In all of these studies, the authors
exploit plausibly exogenous changes in media exposure across both space and time. The addition
of spatial variation allows these authors to control more convincingly for trends that may confound
the treatments in question.
The assumption necessary for a causal interpretation of KL’s results is that trends in teen
birth rates in geographic areas with high- and low-MTV viewership would have been the same,
conditional on area and time fixed effect and a limited set of covariates, in the absence of 16 and
Pregnant. How likely is it that this identifying assumption holds? Teen birth rates began falling
precipitously with the onset of the Great Recession in 2008 and there were profound racial and
ethnic differences in the rate of decline. Given the substantial geographic variation in racial/ethnic
composition, trends in birth rates in the media markets used by KL are also likely to vary because
of different trends in birth rates by race/ethnicity. These differences may confound KL’s estimates
and violate the parallel trend assumption necessary for a causal interpretation.
This is precisely what we find. Allowing for differential time trends by the racial/ethnic
composition of a media market eliminates any association between 16 and Pregnant and teen birth
rates, as well as the birth rates of women ages 20 to 24 and 25-29. We obtain the same null findings
when we interact the racial/ethnic composition of an area with the unemployment rate. The
importance of differential time trends in teen birth rates prior to 16 and Pregnant is evident from

3

KL’s own results. They report no association between 16 and Pregnant and the birth rates of nonHispanic black and Hispanic teens when their analyses are stratified by race/ethnicity, despite
national data indicating that black and Hispanic young women watched the show as much, or even
more, than their white counterparts (Kearney and Levine 2014).
To assess whether parallel trends in birth rates between low- and high-MTV viewing areas
held before 16 and Pregnant began broadcasting, we perform a series of placebo tests and find an
“effect” of 16 and Pregnant prior to the advent of the show. Using Kearney and Levine’s “IV
Event Study” methodology, we also show that including even a few additional periods in the
analysis prior to the beginning of 16 and Pregnant leads to a rejection of the hypothesis that pretreatment trends were parallel. Combined with our in-sample results, our out-of-sample rejection
of the parallel trends assumption leave little question that KL’s results do not warrant a causal
interpretation.

KL’s Empirical Framework

KL’s empirical model consists of the following four equations

where BRjt is the birth rate by calendar quarter of conception t, in Designated Market Area (DMA)
j; Rate16Pj is the average Nielsen rating in DMA j for the shows 16 and Pregnant, Teen Mom, and
Teen Mom 2 for 12 to 24 year-old viewers for the seven Nielsen sweep months, when viewership
is measured to set advertising rates for the following period, of July 2009, February 2010, July
2010, November 2010, May 2011, November 2011, and May 2012; Postt is a dichotomous
indicator for the period after the introduction of 16 and Pregnant; MTV0809j is the average Nielsen
rating for 12 through 24 year olds in DMAj for all MTV shows in the sweeps months of July 2008,
November 2008, February 2009, and May 2009, Ujy is the annual unemployment rate in DMA j
in year y; Xjy is a vector that includes the percent population in the DMA that is that non-Hispanic
black, and the percent that is Hispanic in calendar year y; the qt’s represent time period (quarter)
fixed effects; and the

js’s

are full sets of DMA ´ season fixed effects, which also implicitly

include DMA fixed effects. Note that we have modified KL’s notation to reflect that the
parameters and disturbance terms differ across equations.
Equation (1) represents the equation of interest that yields estimates of the association
between 16 and Pregnant viewership and teen birth rates. Equation (3) is the first stage regression
with (MTV0809j ´ Postt) as an instrument. Equation (2) is the second stage regression and identical
to equation (1) except that predicted 16 and Pregnant viewership derived from equation (2) is used
instead of actual 16 and Pregnant viewership. Equation (4) represents the reduced form effect of
MTV viewership on teen birth rates.
KL’s study period includes 24 quarters (2005:QI – 2010:QIV) for 205 DMAs for a total
(potential) sample of 4,920 observations. The dependent variable is missing in some DMAs in
some quarters because there are no teen births. This occurs more frequently in the analyses

5

stratified by age or race/ethnicity. Ratings for 16 and Pregnant are measured during the time slot
from 9:00 to 10:00 pm for 12- to 24-year-old viewers on Tuesdays in the sweep months. KL
average these Tuesday ratings within each month and then average the four months of ratings and
assign that value to the six post-16 and Pregnant quarters within each DMA. They follow the
same procedure for the MTV ratings during the period 2008:QIII to 2009:QII by using the average
for the four quarters within each DMA. The ratings that KL use for 16 and Pregnant and MTV
therefore vary only in the cross section (by DMA).
KL use the interaction between a time-invariant, DMA-specific measure of MTV
viewership and an indicator for the post-16 and Pregnant period as the instrument for the
viewership of 16 and Pregnant. For the instrument to be valid, MTV viewership in the pre-16 and
Pregnant Period must “randomly” assign 16 and Pregnant viewership, conditional on DMA fixed
effects and a small number of covariates. Because of the inclusion of DMA fixed effects, this
interaction is necessary to generate time series variation in the instrument, which consists of zeros
in all DMAs and all quarters from 2005:QI to 2009:QII with a discrete jump for each DMA in
2009:QIII. The measure of 16 and Pregnant is also time invariant in the post-treatment period
(and obviously zero in the pre-treatment period), generating a strong first-stage association.

II.

Within-Sample Evaluation of KL’s Identifying Assumptions

KL’s reduced form compares teen birth rates before and after the introduction of 16 and
Pregnant, stratified by levels of MTV viewership in the year before the show began. The key
identification assumption is therefore parallel trends: in the absence of 16 and Pregnant, birth
rates should change in the same way in areas with high and low MTV viewership. Figure 1 shows

6

that overall teen birth rates decline significantly prior to 16 and Pregnant and that the rate of
decline accelerates after 2007 with the onset of the Great Recession. There is substantial variation
in the rate of decline across race/ethnicity groups. The average annual change in teen births
between 2005 and 2010 was -1.9 percent among non-Hispanic whites, -2.9 percent among nonHispanic blacks and -6.3 percent among Hispanics (our calculations based on data reported in
Hamilton, et al. 2015).
While differential trends across race/ethnicity groups in birth rates do not, by themselves,
invalidate KL’s identification strategy, the likelihood that these differential trends will cause the
parallel trends assumption to be violated increases to the extent to which DMAs vary in their ethnic
composition. We find that the correlation between MTV viewership (in 2008-9) and the nonHispanic black share of the female population (in 2005) is quite high (0.413) while substantially
lower for the Hispanic share (0.093). This masks some variation, however, for Hispanics. In 2005,
the Hispanic share of the female population across the four quartiles (lowest to highest) of MTV
viewership was 11.1, 19.8, 16.6 and 18.1, respectively. The corresponding values for the nonHispanic black share in 2005 across quartiles of MTV viewership were monotonic: 7.6, 11.6, 13.9,
and 20.3, respectively. These substantial differences in race/ethnicity across quartiles of the
instrument are a threat to KL’s identification strategy if there are differential trends by racial
groups within high- and low-MTV watching areas. This is what we find in Figure 2, which
presents trends in log teen birth rates for each of the race/ethnicity groups that KL examine for
groups of DMAs by quartile of MTV viewership in 2008-09. For non-Hispanic blacks and
Hispanics, in particular, the trends in log teen birth rates across MTV quartiles do not appear to be
parallel.

7

To assess formally the importance of this potential confounding for KL’s estimates, we
augment their model with time trends that vary with levels of the exogenous covariates,
particularly the pre-16 and Pregnant racial/ethnic composition. This approach has been used in
several recent articles (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009; Hoynes, Schanzenbach, and Almond
2016; and Hjort, Sølvsten, and Wüst, 2017). Large changes in the IV and reduced form coefficients
after including these trends would suggest that KL’s estimates are biased.
The results are shown in Table 1. In each panel, we show the reduced form estimates from
equation (4) and the IV estimates from equation (2), which include DMA and period fixed effects.
Panel 1 exactly replicates KL’s reduced form and IV estimates for comparison. In panel 2 we
show estimates from a specification in which we interact the values of the covariates, X, in 2005
(well before the start of 16 and Pregnant) with the period fixed effects. Both the reduced form
relationship between MTV and the IV estimate of the impact of 16 and Pregnant are reduced by a
factor of approximately 10 and are no longer statistically significantly different from zero.
The results in panel 2 strongly suggest that the parallel trends assumption in KL’s model
does not hold.

In panel 3 we reduce the possibility of overfitting by estimating a more

parsimonious specification, adding only interactions of the three covariates with a linear trend to
the base models from equations (4) and (2). These results are very similar to those in panel 2 and,
again, suggest that the parallel trends assumption does not hold. In panel 4 we limit the trend
interactions to the percent non-Hispanic black and percent Hispanic in 2005, yielding reduced form
and IV coefficients that are still approximately only 1/3 the size of those in panel 1 and are not
statistically significantly different from zero. In contrast, in panel 5 we include only the interaction
of a trend with the unemployment rate in 2005 and obtain results that are quite similar to KL’s in
panel 1.

8

As Figures 1 and 2 suggest, the results in panels 4 and 5 lead to the conclusion that the
effect of 16 and Pregnant that KL estimate is largely driven by differential trends in birth rates
across race and ethnic groups that are correlated with the timing of the introduction 16 and
Pregnant. We confirm this in panels 6 through 8, where we simplify the trend interactions further
and merely interact the covariate levels in 2005 with Postt. The single interaction of the covariate
levels in 2005 with the post-period dummy is nested within the specification that interacts the same
covariates with the complete set of time fixed effects. A Wald test indicates that we cannot reject
the restrictions implied in panel 6 relative to panel 2. The results are essentially the same as in
panels 3 through 5. Taken together, the results in Table 1 strongly suggest that the parallel trend
assumption underlying the KL analysis does not hold and that a causal interpretation of KL’s
estimated impact of 16 and Pregnant is unwarranted and, indeed, that 16 and Pregnant had no
meaningful effect on teen birth rates.

Stratification by Age

In their Table 2, KL present results of the effect of 16 and Pregnant stratified by age and
race/ethnicity. We exactly replicate their estimates for 20 to 24 year olds (panel 1), 25 to 29 year
olds (panel 2) and 30 to 34 year olds (panel 3) in the odd-numbered rows in our Table 2. In the
even-numbered rows, we modify those specifications by including, as in panel 3 of Table 1, a
linear time trend interacted with the level of the three covariates in 2005. We have also estimated
these models using both the full set of period ´ 2005 covariate interactions as well as the 2005
covariates interacted with the Postt dummy. The results are qualitatively similar and available
from the authors by request. As in Table 1, when we include these interactions, we find no

9

statistically significant associations between 16 and Pregnant and birth rates by age. For example,
KL report that a one ratings point increase in the viewership of 16 and Pregnant lowers birth rates
of 20-24 year-olds by 2.4 percent (row 3, panel 1). Inclusion of the additional trend terms reduces
the effect to a statistically insignificant reduction (p-value of 0.19) of 0.9 percent (row 4, panel 1).
We find the same pattern for 25-29 and 30-34 year-olds, respectively.
The results in Tables 1 and 2 suggest that the estimated association between 16 and
Pregnant and teen birth rates reported by KL is due to differential trends in birth rates across areas
in ways that are associated with MTV viewing. The more challenging task is to explain why. As
Figure 1 shows, the differential rate of decline in teen birth rates by race/ethnicity appears to have
increased with the onset of the Great Recession. Several recent studies demonstrate that the Great
Recession had particularly large effects on the fertility of young women (Sobotka, Skirbekk, and
Philipov, 2011; Cherlin, et al. 2013). Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2017) show that recent trade
shocks that affect the employment opportunities of less educated men and women decrease both
marriage and birth rates. Kearney and Wilson (2017) have documented that improved economic
conditions from the fracking boom may lead to increased non-marital and marital fertility. Most
relevant for our analysis, Villarreal (2014) finds that areas with relatively large Hispanic
populations may have been more affected by the Great Recession through decreased employment
and flow of immigrants.
To explore the differential response of birth rates to the Great Recession, in Table 3 we
interact each of the three covariate levels in 2005 with the unemployment rate. We find that for
teens, the IV coefficient on 16 and Pregnant falls from -2.37 (Table 2, row 3) to -0.562 (Table 3,
row 2). For this group, the interaction between the share of the DMA that is black in 2005 and the
unemployment rate is negative and statistically significant – consistent with the hypothesis that

10

worse labor market conditions lowered birth rates differentially for minority populations. We find
similar results for Hispanics in the other age groups. For all age groups, the interaction between
the unemployment rate in 2005 and the contemporaneous unemployment rate are also statistically
significant, suggesting a non-linear relationship between birth rates and labor market conditions.
As in Tables 2 and 3, allowing for the effect of the racial/ethnic composition on birth rates to vary
over time reduces the reduced form and IV coefficients such that they are no longer statistically
significant.

Stratification by Race/Ethnicity

KL stratify by race/ethnicity and find that the effects of 16 and Pregnant are statistically
significant for non-Hispanic whites and marginally so for Hispanics. In the odd-numbered rows
of Table 4 we replicate these results for all three race/ethnicity groups. KL do not include
race/ethnicity variables in these regressions. To test the parallel trends assumption, therefore, we
now include a full set of DMA-specific time trends. KL find that an increase in 16 and Pregnant
viewership lowers the birth rates of non-Hispanic whites by 2.4 percent (panel 1, row 3). When
we include DMA-specific trends, this coefficient turns positive and is statistically insignificantly
different from zero (panel 1, row 4). We find no statistically significant reduced form or IV effects
for non-Hispanic blacks (panel 2) or Hispanics (panel 3). As with the full sample, we find little
in these results to suggest that 16 and Pregnant affected birth rates in any of the race/ethnicity
groups.

III.

Out-of-Sample Evaluation of KL’s Identifying Assumptions

As Kahn-Lang and Lang (forthcoming) note, differences in mean outcomes between the
treatment and control groups at some point prior to the beginning of treatment suggest that parallel
trends between the two groups do not hold unless there is some identifiable explanation. One way
to assess these differences is to extend the pre-treatment period. The choice of how long into the
past to extend the pre-treatment period is, of course, arbitrary. This is a practical not a conceptual
issue, however, as the beginning of the pre-treatment period is usually determined arbitrarily, by
data availability, or by path dependence in the conduct of the analysis. Even if there are level
differences at some point in the past, small changes in the length of the pre-treatment period should
not greatly affect estimated treatment effects if the parallel trends assumption holds.
In practice, there are few guidelines for what constitutes a sufficiently long (or short) pretreatment period, which may lead to “cherry picking” results. Robustness of results to pretreatment periods of different lengths would increase confidence in those results, particularly when
the pre-treatment period includes geographic and over-time variation in factors that are known
predictors of the outcome. Periods, like the Great Recession, in which the covariates differ in their
relationship to the outcome relative to other periods, may be ill-suited for inclusion in the analysis.
We conduct two types of analyses to assess the validity of the parallel trends assumption.
In the first, we do placebo tests to assess the “impact” of 16 and Pregnant in periods before the
show was broadcast.

In the second, we replicate KL’s “Reduced Form Event Study” and

incrementally extend the pre-treatment period further into the past.

12

Placebo Tests

As we have noted, MTV ratings should be unrelated to trends in birth rates conditional on
time and DMA fixed effects except through their relationship with 16 and Pregnant ratings. Any
association between MTV ratings and birth rates in the pre-16 and Pregnant period would suggest
a violation of the exclusion restriction (i.e., parallel trends) necessary for identification. In Table
5, we present results from a series of reduced form and IV regressions in which we artificially start
a placebo “show” in sequential quarters. Each regression includes 24 quarters, the same length of
analysis used by KL: 18 prior to the beginning of the placebo show and 6 after, including the
quarter that the “show” starts. We estimate the reduced form equation (4) and IV equation (5) and
use MTV viewing from 2008-2009 interacted with a post-“show” indicator as the instrument.
Each row of Table 5 presents the estimated coefficients and standard errors from the
estimation of the reduced form and instrumental variables models from a different 24 quarterperiod. For example, in row (1) the 24-quarter period begins in 2001:Q1 and ends in 2006:QIV,
with the placebo show beginning in 2005:QIII. Row 12, which is shaded in the table, reproduces
KL’s reduced form and instrumental variables results from their Table 1 columns (4) and (3),
respectively. For the reduced form, we find that 9 of the 11 estimated coefficients in rows (1)
through (11), which use data exclusively from the pre-16 and Pregnant period, are statistically
different from zero at conventional levels. That all of the estimates are negative and roughly equal
to KL’s reduced form result in magnitude strongly suggests that that the parallel trends assumption
required for the difference-in-differences strategy does not hold. Because the sample period is
fixed at 24 quarters, the first stage relationship between MTV and 16 and Pregnant ratings is quite
stable, with the first-stage coefficient on MTV Ratings ranging from 1.457 in row (1) to 1.524 in

13

row (9); the first-stage coefficient is 1.513 in row (12), which corresponds to KL’s analysis period.
The IV results therefore reflect those from the reduced form.
Adjusting for multiple comparisons in Table 5 using the Bonferroni (1936) correction or
the somewhat more powerful Bonferroni-Holm (Holm 1979) correction leads to rejection of none
of the null hypotheses that the coefficients in both the reduced form and instrumental variables
placebo results equal to zero. For the purposes of these tests, we treat the reduced form and
instrumental variables results separately. Both the Bonferroni and Bonferroni-Holm multiple
comparison procedures fix the so-called familywise error rate (the rate of committing any Type I
error) and tend to have substantially less power than single comparison procedures. An alternative
procedure is to focus on the so-called false discovery rate (FDR), which is less conservative and
fixes the share of null hypothesis rejections that are false rather than fixing the probability that any
null hypothesis rejections are false. When we perform the Benjamini-Hochberg (1995) on the 11
placebo reduced form tests, we do not reject any of the hypotheses implicit in Table 5 when we fix
the FDR at 5 or 10 percent. Increasing the FDR to 11 percent leads to the rejection of the null in
rows 7 through 9, and increasing it to twenty percent allows us to reject the null in all but row 1.
If we fix the FDR at 5 percent for the placebo instrumental variables results, we reject the null that
the coefficient in row 7 is equal to zero. Increasing the FDR to 10 percent, leads to the rejection
of the null hypotheses that the coefficients in rows 6 through 10 are separately equal to zero, and
if the FDR is set at 20 percent we reject the nulls in rows 4 through 11.
The IV estimates in Table 5 are similar to KL’s “IV Event Study” (p. 3614) in the sense
that we use data on MTV and 16 and Pregnant Ratings that post-date the period under study. For
example, in row (7) our IV estimate suggests that teen birth rates decrease 2.194 percent from a
one rating point increase in our placebo 16 and Pregnant show, which is very similar to the

14

estimate of -1.88 that KL report in their Figure 6 and Appendix Table B1. Our estimate captures
unobserved and time-varying factors within the DMA that are correlated with teen birth rates and
16 and Pregnant viewership. Finding any statistically significant coefficients in a period before
16 and Pregnant began broadcasting strongly suggests that KL’s instrument is invalid.
Although we have presented a series of placebo results in order to keep from “cherry
picking” those that are particularly favorable to our argument, we recognize that the results in
Table 5 are not independent of one another when the “treatment” periods overlap.

We have

therefore boxed rows 1 and 7 to illustrate results where the “post” periods are disjoint (and as
indicated above, all placebo “treatment” periods are disjoint from the actual period when 16 and
Pregnant was being broadcast). Focusing only on rows 1, 7, and 12, on the basis of the coefficients
and their statistical significance, it would be virtually impossible to distinguish which of these
results was generated by the actual 16 and Pregnant and which were placebo tests.

“Reduced Form Event Study”

KL present results from an “event study” of the reduced-form relationship between MTV
viewership and teen birth rates (KL Figure 5 and Appendix Table B1). Their primary goal is to
assess the validity of the parallel trends assumption. They estimate the following regression:
14

(5)

ln(BR jt ) = β0 + ∑ α i ( MTV 0809 j × PreQi ) +
i=1

24

∑ β ( MTV 0809 × PostQ ) +φ U
j

i

i=19

i

jy

+θt +δ js + ε jt .

The coefficients αi show the average difference in log birth rates for varying levels of MTV
viewership by quarter of conception in the pre-16 and Pregnant period (quarters 1 to 14, 2005:QI2009:QII) relative to the reference category (quarters 15 to 18, 2008:QIII-2009:QII). The βi
15

coefficients show the same contrast, but for the six quarters after the introduction of 16 and
Pregnant (quarters 19 to 24: 2009:III-2010:QIV). KL reported that the joint null hypothesis that
L+ = 0, L7 = 0, … , L+K = 0 cannot be rejected, but the null hypothesis that *+O = 0, *7, =
0, … , *7K = 0 is rejected (p<0.01).
KL take the lack of a statistically significant relationship between MTV and birth rates in
the pre-16 and Pregnant period as evidence that their instrument meets the exclusion restriction.
We test this assumption further by extending the event study analysis backwards in increments of
two years. In Figure 3, Panels 1, 2, and 3, we present results from estimating equation (5) for
periods with the starting year in 2005 (KL’s period), 2003, and 2001, respectively. We present the
c2 statistic for the joint test of the coefficients in the pre-16 and Pregnant period. Unlike KL, we
use the first four quarters in each panel as the reference period. The c2 tests for the coefficients in
the pre-16 and Pregnant period are invariant to the choice of a reference category (in the pretreatment period). KL’s choice of using the four quarters prior to the start of 16 and Pregnant as
the reference category is arbitrary, tends to obscure the smooth trends in the birth rates, and gives
the appearance of a discontinuity when, in fact, a break in trend is difficult to discern.
The downward trend in teen birth rates in the years prior to 16 and Pregnant and the lack
of a clear discontinuity at 2009:QIII is quite apparent in all three panels and we strongly reject the
null hypothesis that the pre-16 and Pregnant coefficients are jointly equal to zero in Panels 2 and
3 with p-values of 0.036 and <0.001, respectively. These results are not artifacts of greatly
extending the period of analysis. Extending the pre-16 and Pregnant period even by only two
years (Panel A of Table 2) results in rejection of the null that pre-treatment coefficients are jointly
equal to zero. The sensitivity of KL’s results to extending the pre-treatment period by even a small
amount suggests that the assumptions needed to identify a causal effect are unlikely to be met.

16

Although there is no formal and global test of the parallel trends assumption, even a lack
of rejection of differential trends cannot disprove a change in trends for the counterfactual group
in the post-treatment period. In the case of 16 and Pregnant, a number of factors suggest that
underlying trends in teen fertility may be confounding KL's estimate of its impact. As we show
in Figure 2, there are clearly differential trends in teen birth rates by race/ethnicity and MTV
viewership prior to the beginning of 16 and Pregnant. There is also a noticeable dip in the reducedform relationship between MTV viewership and birth rates beginning in 2008, as shown in panels
B and C of Figure 3, that is coincident with the onset of the Great Recession. A point-in-time
change at the national level is more vulnerable to coincident shocks than interventions that occur
across time and space.

IV.

Conclusion

Identification strategies that interact fixed pre-treatment characteristics with variables that
vary over time are quite common and may seem particularly enticing for evaluating policies or
treatments that begin at a single point in time for an entire population. In such cases, the lack of
an obvious counterfactual for the treated group in the post-treatment period makes identification
of causal effects difficult, and studies claiming to estimate a causal effect in in the face of such
challenges should be viewed with appropriate skepticism.
As an example of the difficulties associated with identification in these situations, we have
reexamined causal claims that the MTV program 16 and Pregnant was responsible for lowering

17

birth rates substantially in the United States. Our results strongly suggest that the association
between 16 and Pregnant and teen birth rates is due to differential trends in birth rates across areas
with different demographic characteristics in the wake of Great Recession. The fertility rates of
less advantaged teens, as proxied by race/ethnicity, fell much faster with the onset of the recession
than those of white non-Hispanics. We find a relationship between MTV and birth rates even in
the period prior to the existence of 16 and Pregnant, casting substantial doubt on the validity of
the parallel trends assumption required for identification. While is possible that 16 and Pregnant
may have affected teen birth rates, our results point to the difficulty of making a causal claim that
the show, which debuted nationally at the nadir of the Great Recession, had a significant impact
on teen birth rates.
Our results add to a growing literature that highlights the difficulties associated with
identification strategies that employ instruments derived from interacting pre-treatment
characteristics with a time varying variable. Future researchers wishing to identify a causal effect
of a policy that was introduced everywhere at a single point in time, who may be tempted to use
similar instruments, should recognize that “shift-share” instruments are not a panacea and be
careful to assess thoroughly whether the necessary assumptions inherent in such research designs
are credible.

two data sources are confidential.
Notes: Entries in the table are a) in the reduced form, the estimated coefficient on MTV Ratings in 2008:QIII2009:QII interacted with a dummy variable for being in the "post" period and b) for instrumental variables, the
estimated coefficient on 16 and Pregnant Ratings interacted with a dummy variable for being in the "post" period
where the instrument is the regressor of interest from the reduced form regressions. Standard errors, clustered by
DMA, are shown in parentheses. All regressions are weighted by the female population aged 15-19 in the DMA at
the time of the observation. In each regression there are 18 pre-"show" quarers and 6 post-"show" quarters. All
regressions also include the unemployment rate, the percent of the population that is non-Hispanic black and the
percent of the population that is Hispanic, 24 quarter fixed effects as well DMA × season fixed effects as regressors.
Row (12), the period analyzed by Kearney and Levine (2015b), is shaded. The two boxed rows, (1) and (7), are an
example of results that do not share any "post" period in common. Sample size in rows (1) through (9), and (11) is
4,918, the sample size in row (10) is 4,917, and the sample size in row (12) is 4,919. *** indicates significant at the
1 percent level, ** indicates significant at the 5 percent level, * indicates significant at the 10 percent level.
