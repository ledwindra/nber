    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper discusses what recent economic research tells us about exchange rate pass-through and what this suggests for the control of monetary policy.  It first focuses on exchange rate pass-through from a macroeconomic perspective and then examines the microeconomic evidence.  In light of this evidence, it then discusses the implications of exchange rate movements on the conduct of monetary policy.\n\n",
