The Gendered Spillover Effect of Young Children's Health on Human Capital: Evidence from
Turkey

NBER Working Paper No. 23702
August 2017
JEL No. I25,J16,O15
ABSTRACT
Recent policy debates on closing the education gender gap in developing countries have focused
on cash transfers, but standard models of intrahousehold allocation imply that reducing the
opportunity cost of girls' schooling might also be effective. I test this prediction using quasiexperimental variation from a national vaccination campaign targeting under-five children in
Turkey. I find gains in health and human capital among age-eligible children of both sexes.
However, educational spillover effects accrue exclusively to their adolescent, ineligible sisters.
These spillover effects are increasing if the mother works outside the home and in the number of
young children in the household, and are absent if an elder sister is present. My results suggest
reducing morbidity among preschool children may have the added benefit of improving
educational outcomes for their adolescent sisters in the developing world

Introduction

Gender equity is an important development goal and various policies have been advocated for
its achievement (see review by Du‡o (2012)). Many of these policies are aimed at increasing
girls’education, since female education has been correlated with later and lower childbearing,
improved parenting, and higher labor market participation among women.1 Common policy
instruments include subsidized schooling, a¢ rmative action and conditional cash transfers.
Yet in many developing countries, a gendered division of labor starts early and places the
burden of household activities (including childcare) on older girls.2 The combination of such
norms with high frequency morbidity among young children in developing countries could
therefore meaningfully a¤ect the educational experience of their older sisters.
Evidence consistent with this mechanism is presented in Figure 1 which demonstrates
that, for Turkish children 11 to 14 years of age, the schooling gap between adolescent boys
and girls increases in illness episodes experienced by younger children in the household. A
similar pattern is found when using Demographic and Health surveys around the world and
conditioning on household …xed e¤ects (Alsan, Xing, Wise, Darmstadt, and Bendavid, 2017).

Other studies which have investigated cross-sibling e¤ects of health endowments or shocks tend to
focus on whether parental investments reinforce or compensate for these di¤erences. For recent examples
see Yi, Heckman, Zhang, and Conti (2015), Parman (2013) and Adhvaryu and Nyshadham (2014). Ozier
(Forthcoming) investigated spillover e¤ects of the deworming treatment by Miguel and Kremer (2004) in
Kenya on unborn children several years later. Black, Breining, Figlio, Guryan, Karbownkik, Nielsen, Roth,
and Simonsen (2017) investigate whether birth order gaps are excacerbated when a disabled younger child
enters the household. Seminal theoretical contributions include Becker and Tomes (1979) and Behrman,
Pollak, and Taubman (1982).

Notes: Data are from the Turkish Demographic and Health Surveys
(1993 1998 and 2003).

The notion that older sisters’education is particularly sensitive to younger siblings’health
was …rst articulated by Rosenzweig and Pitt (1990, p. 970) : "A natural question is whether
changes in infant morbidity would signi…cantly a¤ect the disparities in the intrafamily allocation of activities by sex...and thus whether observed gender inequality in human capital
would be reduced through improvements in child health." However, Pitt and Rosenzweig
underscored this hypothesis was not easily testable since instruments that a¤ect children’s
health exclusively were di¢ cult to …nd.
This paper aims to …ll this gap in the literature and formally test the hypothesis that
the gender gap in education is a¤ected by early childhood health in developing countries. I
exploit one of the most successful and largest mass vaccination campaigns in recent history
–the Turkish National Immunization Campaign of 1985. The campaign sought to immunize
Turkish children under …ve against a battery of infectious diseases. The size of the under-…ve
population targeted and the number of diseases included in the e¤ort (measles, polio, as
well as diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT)) were ambitious and the logistical accomplishments of the campaign unprecedented. Within three months 27 million vaccines had
been administered; coverage for measles vaccine increased from 37 to 83% nationwide and a
similarly impressive jump was noted for DPT vaccination.
The empirical strategy adopted exploits heterogeneity in the pre-campaign prevalence
of vaccine preventable illness to compare areas that experienced a relatively larger gain
in coverage to areas that experienced a more modest increase. The strategy developed in
the paper corrects for underreporting of vital events which is particularly severe in rural
areas and presents an obstacle to impact evaluation in developing countries.3 The greatest
threat to the validity of the analysis is that vaccine preventable disease (VPD) prevalence
is not randomly assigned. High VPD prevalence in the pre-campaign period is correlated
with low literacy and socioeconomic status unconditionally – and such areas could be on
a di¤erent time path than areas with less prevalent disease. I provide evidence that VPD
prevalence is uncorrelated with almost all pre-campaign covariates prior to the rollout of
the intervention conditional on other covariates. In the main analysis, province …xed e¤ects
control for time-invariant unobservables that are correlated with high VPD. Moreover, the
changes that occur are speci…c to 1985: placebo intervention dates for the campaign fail to
produce similar results.
The immunization campaign did not achieve its stated goal of reducing infant or child
mortality. Reasons for the null e¤ect are discussed, with the most likely one being that
vaccine preventable illnesses were not a leading cause of mortality for this age group at
3

The UN estimates that only 65% of births and one-third of all deaths are recorded through civil registration throughout the world (Mikkelsen, Lopez, and Phillips, 2015).

the time.4 However, there were declines in disability and gains in schooling for age-eligible
children as measured in their young adult life. A one standard deviation increase in VPD
prevalence during the pre-campaign period is associated with a 5% decline in disability, a
3% increase in literacy and a 2% increase in educational attainment. These …ndings are
robust to a range of controls thought to in‡uence children’s health and education at the
individual, household and local geographic level such as maternal literacy, family structure,
father’s occupation and health care supply. The results are not driven by mean reversion or
a speci…c geographic subsample of the country. The e¤ect of the campaign on disability for
age-eligible children is similar for boys and girls, consistent with o¢ cial reports on widespread
vaccine dissemination, but educational returns are highest for girls with siblings.5
To explore these gender-speci…c e¤ects in more detail and isolate spillover e¤ects, I examine the e¤ect of the campaign on older siblings who were not targeted.6 I …nd older sisters
living with an age-eligible child improve their literacy and educational attainment, while
older brothers do not. Data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in Turkey
and government enrollment statistics reveal where in the years of schooling distribution girls
gained. The results show that more girls were induced to attend school on the extensive
margin and to complete the "compulsory" education heavily subsidized by the state.
The results are interpreted within a model of the intrahousehold distribution of resources
across children. In an environment where parents seek to maximize the expected earnings
of their children, and the human capital of the youngest children require inputs of time,
parents must choose how much time an older sibling may spend in school and how much
time he/she spends performing childcare and other household activities. If there are lower
returns to girls’schooling in the labor market, parents will demand less schooling for their
daughters than their sons. Furthermore, if the opportunity cost of time in school increases
more for girls than boys when a younger sibling is sick, due to a gendered division of labor in
the home and substitutability between mother and older daughter (Rosenzweig, 1980), then
illness shocks among young children will exacerbate the gender gap in education.
Several …ndings support the notion that opportunity costs and gender norms in household
labor play a key role in the behavioral mechanism underpinning the empirical results. First,
the di¤erential gendered e¤ect is increasing in the number of young children in the household
4

Results on mortality might be more impressive for the rollout of pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccination
(since pneumonia and diarrhea are the leading causes of child mortality in developing countries). More recent
research suggests the measles virus suppresses the immune system by attacking memory B cells and could
leave a long lasting impact on the ability of individuals to …ght many di¤erent types of infections (Mina,
Metcalf, de Swart, Osterhaus, and Grenfell, 2015). The implication is that measles vaccination therefore
protects against other common illnesses which would require childcare.
5
Vaccination of older siblings is protective for the health of younger children though the converse is not
necessarily true, since older children typically have acquired natural immunity by school age.
6
I use the term "spillover" to refer to gains that are not directly related to receipt of the vaccine. Although
older age children might also bene…t from herd immunity – and this might be larger for girls than boys if
they are tasked with childcare, this does not appear to be the main explanation for my …ndings given the
U-shaped age pattern of vaccine preventable illness morbidity. See section 4.

and muted if there are no age-eligible children in the household. Second, the gendered
spillover e¤ect is greater if the supply of maternal domestic time is limited by work outside
the home, particularly in cotton …elds. Third, the gendered spillover e¤ect is absent among
households with grandmothers or other older sisters, potential substitutes for a mothers’
domestic time.
The model and the paper focus on time. Of course, less illness in a household also lowers
medical expenditures and increases household income. Although primary schooling in Turkey
was free, parents may simply prefer educating boys on average, thus marginal changes in
income should a¤ect daughters’education more than sons’. I argue the income channel is
less plausible since the positive wealth shock to the household from reduced morbidity of
an under-…ve child is small. Child illness episodes treated in the public sector are heavily
subsidized but require time to travel, wait and stay with a child if hospitalized or follow
instructions to care for the sick child at home.7 Empirically, I do not …nd signi…cant impacts
of the campaign on parental occupational status. The notion that time is a key determinant
of child health in developing countries was highlighted in Miller and Urdinola (2010) and in
the 1985 UNICEF State of the World’s Children Report (UNICEF, 1985).8
This paper draws upon research at the intersection of infectious disease, children’s health,
gender and development. It contributes to the body of scholarship developed by Doug Almond, Janet Currie, Paul Gertler and others on child development and later life economic
outcomes.9 It provides an additional explanation for the rise of female schooling. Becker,
Hubbard, and Murphy (2010) focus on female comparative advantage in noncognitive skills
as the driving force. Pitt, Rosenzweig, and Hassan (2012) adapt the Roy model of occupational choice. In their model, health investments predict larger schooling gains for girl than
boy children since health increases returns to labor in the brawn economy, increasing the
opportunity cost of boys’schooling. This paper complements such an explanation, emphasizing how technological advances in child health will disproportionately impact the time
budget of those primarily tasked with caring for them when they are ill. The paper also
touches on debates about how to close the gender gap in developing countries. Much focus
has been on the relative merits of gender-speci…c a¢ rmative action policies and economic
growth. The …ndings herein point to improved child health as another potential policy tool.
7

In 1961, Turkey passed a law to socialize it’s health service ("Statute of Socialization of Health Services"). Socialization was de…ned as providing free services at the point of delivery (with the exception
of the cost of drugs), and collecting premiums to pay for the services. The collection of premiums was
never implemented, but health centers linked to hospitals for provision of primary care were established and
sta¤ed by doctors (recent medical graduates) who were assigned two years compulsory service after graduation (Fisek and Erdal, 1985; Topalli, 2015). Other mechanisms (e.g. epidemiologic spillovers and taste-based
discrimination) are considered below but cannot su¢ ciently explain the spillover results.
8
Although time may be less important in developed countries, there is still strong evidence of a gendered
division of parental responsibility for childrens’health. According to a recent Kaiser Health Survey in the
United States, 81% of mothers report they are responsible for assuring a child receives recommended care.
Among working parents with children under 18 in the home, 39% of mothers (compared to 3% of fathers)
report primary responsibility for taking care of children when they are sick (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2014).

motivate and interpret the results; section 4 describes the identi…cation strategy and the

Background

2.1

Turkish National Immunization Campaign

In 1980, Jim P. Grant became UNICEF director and shortly thereafter unveiled an initiative
known as the child survival revolution which was based on four simple strategies: Growth
Monitoring, Oral Rehydration, Breastfeeding and Immunizations (GOBI).10 As part of the
revolution, Grant was searching for a low-resource country that would serve as a showcase for
a successful mass immunization campaign. Grant sought out Turgut Özal, a colleague from
his days at USAID, and a man who had subsequently gone on to become Turkey’s prime
minister. Özal agreed with the concept and the planning began. As described in a subsequent
UNICEF report, the campaign "had a clear aim: to show that a large middle-income country
with high infant mortality and barely average EPI coverage could inexpensively vaccinate at
least 80% of its children – despite barriers of weather, terrain, and population dispersion"
(UNICEF, 1986, page 7).11
The campaign began with then Turkish President Kenan Evren vaccinating a baby in
front of the press. This launched the …rst ten day campaign, with two more occurring before
the end of the year. The campaign involved an impressive collaboration across sectors. Widespread media messages were conveyed by the press. Imams were given a prepared sermon to
deliver from 54,000 mosques throughout the country on the Friday evening before campaign
launch which quoted text on the importance of caring for children from the Quran.12 "Not
10

This section draws heavily on the following publications:
"Rapid Assessment: Turkish National Immunization Campaign of 1985" (UNICEF, 1986), "Report of the
Baseline Survey for the 1985 Turkish National Immunization Campaign" (Tunçbilek, Cerit, Unalan, Akadli,
and Toros, 1985) and "The Vaccination Situation of Children Between 0-5 Years of Age After the Accelerated Vaccination Campaign and a Comparison with Pre-Campaign Results" (Tunçbilek, E et al., 1986).
Unfortunately, only the published results from the baseline survey are available and they are compared to
the reconstructed variable in Appendix Figure B3.
11
Other mass vaccination campaigns include Brazil (1980 to 1985), India (1985) and Burkina Faso (late
1984). However, the Brazil campaign only included polio vaccination, the India campaign was instituted by
private doctors, and the Burkina Faso campaign also had a primary health care component. The 1985 Turkish
campaign is therefore unique in its scale, number of di¤erent types of vaccines delivered, use of the public
sector and focus on child health (Barron, Buch, Behr, and Crisp, 1987). Though other vaccination campaigns
had been carried out in Turkey prior to 1985, they were not nearly as large scale or well coordinated, typically
only serving small areas. Furthermore, to the extent such campaigns were delivered e¤ectively (and I have
no evidence to suggest they were), they will be incorporated into the baseline measure of VPD prevalence
used in the empirical strategy. I thank Resul Cesur for the comment.

to miss one single child," became a national motto. Turkish Radio and Television donated
free air time and an average of six articles were carried in the main national newspapers
every day until the campaign’s end. Healthcare workers (physicians and paramedicals) were
trained and the cold chain infrastructure was bolstered with private and public donations.
The target population pre-campaign was estimated at 5.1 million children between 0 and 60
months. There were over 45,000 vaccination stations aimed at being within a 10-15 minute
travel time from each home. Health centers, mosques and schools as well as a few businesses
served as vaccination sites.

Gender Norms in Turkey

This section seeks to provide context for the gender norms that existed and upon which the
immunization campaign was superimposed to motivate the hypothesis that girls might have
bene…tted more in response to early child health interventions than boys. Patterns on time
use by gender and beliefs about the relative bene…ts of educating girls are described.
2.2.1

Time Use

The …rst nationally representative time use survey in Turkey was performed in 2006. Although approximately 20 years after the intervention, the pattern produced below is relevant
and was likely more pronounced at the time of the campaign. Figure 3 Panel A shows the
time (in minutes) that are spent on household activities by age group and gender. The divergence in tasks begins early: young women 15 to 24 years old report spending much more
time on household activities than their male peers. These results are similar when looking
within households. A regression of time (in minutes) spent on household chores on gender
and household …xed e¤ects limited to never married individuals 15-24 years of age yields a
coe¢ cient of 169.19 signi…cant at the 1% level. Within the same household, in 2006, girls
spent almost three hours more on household activities than boys did on a typical day.
2.2.2

Beliefs about Education

Since the Kemalist Reforms, education was compulsory in Turkey and part of a larger strategy to reduce the in‡uence of religious schools as well as develop a workforce for modernization. According to Berkes (1998, p. 466), "the constitutional provision that every Turkish
citizen had the right to free primary education and the subsequent educational laws making
secular education compulsory to the age of twelve were active deterrents to the opening of
religious schools in competition with the primary schools administered by the Ministry of
Education." Despite this law, there may be parental preferences regarding child education
by gender. The Demographic and Health Survey in 2008 asked women whether they agreed
with this statement: "It is better to educate sons than daughters." I limit the sample to
mothers born on or before 1965, so as to recreate the views of the population that would
have had young kids at the time of the campaign. Caution should be used when interpreting the results given concerns about survival bias, demand bias and opinions shifting over
time. There is heterogeneity in the proportion of mothers that admit to agreeing with this
statement, close to zero in some provinces, and almost two-…fths in others. Figure 3 Panel
B shows a positive correlation between where this view is more openly expressed and the
pre-campaign VPD prevalence, conditional on age. Together, these graphs provide support
for the notion that girls were often tasked with childcare roles (or household chores when
a mother is preoccupied with a sick child) and that girls’education was viewed as less important than boys’, particularly in areas where the campaign should have had the greatest
10

impact.

Model of Intrahousehold Time Allocation in the Presence of Early Childhood Illness

In this section, I develop a simple model which seeks to interpret the empirical …ndings.
Building on the work of Jere Behrman and colleagues, parents seek to maximize a parental
welfare function that gives equal weight to each child and is additively separable in a vector of
expected earnings (E) for each of their i children. Following Behrman, Pollak, and Taubman
(1982) I ignore the sequential nature of the decision-making and view allocation as a oneperiod problem taking the number of children as a given.
To focus attention on the salient features of the applied work, I assume there are three
children per household: an older schoolage boy and girl sibling and an under-…ve younger
child. The expected earnings of each i child is a function of their time in school S (if ageeligible) and an early childhood health investment, H: Ei = E(Si ; Hi ): Health of young children are determined by their endowment at birth, e; which is complemented by investments
of domestic time. For older schoolage children, the stock of health-related time investments
when the child was under-…ve is …xed at Ho .13 For any child i the expected earnings is
therefore: Ei = p(Si ; Hi )ws where p( ) is the probability of earning the skilled wage and is
strictly concave and monotonically increasing in both arguments. I assume the skilled wage
is higher for males than female, wsb > wsg , which is in line with the data and determined
by equilibrium in the labor market.14 I also assume that separate spheres start early, so
that the outside option for the older girls’ time, were she not in school, would be to perform domestic duties worth price of wd whereas the older boy would work in agriculture for
wa . This division of labor could be due to a comparative advantage males have in "brawn"
(Pitt, Rosenzweig, and Hassan, 2012) or the historical use of the plow (Alesina, Giuliano,
and Nunn, 2013).15 The parents’choose schooling and child health investment to optimize
13

Complementarities between genetic endowments, early child investments and schooling are clearly important (Cunha and Heckman, 2007). However, the model does not need to assume that genetic endowments
di¤er between the sexes or that parents place a higher welfare weight on boys versus girls to obtain the gender
gap in schooling (equation (1)). Behrman (1997) calls this form of parental preference "equal concern."
14
Ilkkaracan and Selim (2007) review the literature on the wage gap in Turkey and note that estimates
vary widely, but data using o¢ cial statistics show that women on average earn 60% of men according to the
hourly wage rate based on 1987 data.
A simpler model whereby the labor market return to boys’ education is higher than girls’ predicts girls
should be preferentially pulled out of school for any household income shock; whereas the model presented
below distinguishes between agriculture and domestic shocks and assesses their varying e¤ect on the gender
gap in education. Empirical evidence suggests the type of shock does matter. Jensen (2000) shows that
rainfall deviations have a larger (negative) e¤ect on boys’education than girls in a¤ected areas.
15
The model is a simpli…cation, since girls often perform agricultural work as well, though all that is
needed is relative specialization by girls and boys from an early stage. This assumption lines up with the
data on gender and child labor in agriculture: boys are 37 percentage points more likely to be working
in agriculture than girls, where girls are more likely to work in the service sector as well as "performing

and v indicates whether or not the child is ill. If the young child is healthy (v = 1), the
mother inelastically supplies all her labor for chores which safeguard child health and such
inputs are su¢ cient. However, if the young child is ill (v = 0), the mother’s supply of time
is not su¢ cient so that, Hy = veDm +(1 v)e(Dm + Dg ).
Calculating full income and maximizing when v = 1 yields the following equilibrium

inelastic supply) widen the education gap whereas agricultural shocks reduce it.16
If v = 0, the …rst order condition with respect to the education of the older boy is
unchanged and re‡ects the trade-o¤ between prices for agriculture and skill. However, for
older sisters the marginal probability of schooling now must equal the ratio of shadow wages
plus a term in the younger sibling: ewsy p0 (Hy ): Thus schooling for girl children will be smaller
when the young child is ill than if he is healthy widening the education gender gap.17 Note
that the gender of the younger child matters as well –since younger brothers have a higher
skilled labor market return, this further reduces equilibrium girl education.18

In the United Nations Report "Legislative Reform on Child Domestic Labour: A Gender Analysis" it
is estimated that 350 million children ages 5-17 are engaged in work, a large percentage in domestic service
(UNICEF, 2008, page i). In addition, "Traditional gender roles have contributed to the assumption that
women and girls make ideal domestic workers because they are subservient and meek. They are also expected
to be well skilled at care giving, child rearing and house keeping, all activities considered to be an extension
of the woman’s natural role (UNICEF, 2008, page 3)." See work by Goldin (1992) for a discussion of the
constancy in gender distinctions in the historical United States labor market.

Empirical Strategy and Data Construction

To identify the e¤ect of the campaign on health and human capital, I employ a di¤erencein-di¤erences (DD) estimator, using the approach described by Card (1992). I use available
health statistics to develop a baseline measure of the prevalence of vaccine prevalence illness
at the local geographic level. The national immunization campaign then provides a treatment
e¤ect that varies depending on how high the burden of disease is prior to its introduction.
Cohorts between 0 to 60 months at the time of the campaign (whose year of birth is between
1980 and 1986) are a¤ected while cohorts born before that time are not directly a¤ected as
in a traditional DD framework.19 The grouped version of this estimator is as follows:
Outcomept =

+

V P Dp Itpost + Itpost + V P Dp + X0pt + "pt;

(2)

where p denotes province and t denotes time. Equation (2) is used because demographic
variables such as child mortality are only calculable at the provincial level. Xpt includes
average maternal literacy, family size, log number of hospitals per capita, professional status
of father, and fraction female. I next turn to an estimating equation which analyzes outcomes
at the individual level, i. This speci…cation allows for the inclusion of individual level controls
to increase precision and time-varying covariates measured at the province level that may be
a source of omitted variable bias (Angrist and Pischke, 2009) and permits an investigation
of di¤erential response by gender. The estimating equation is:
Outcomeipt =

+ (V P Dp Itpost ) +

where Ipc Itj and Iigirl represent indicator variables for province, birth cohort and gender,
respectively. is the di¤erence-in-di¤erences estimate. Xipt is a column vector of covariates
that vary at the individual, household or birth province level and have been shown to in‡uence children’s health and human capital, such as maternal literacy, family size, father’s
occupation, age rank and sex composition of siblings.20 I assess for a gendered impact of the
19
The peak in disabled for the 1980 cohort (Panel B of Figure 2) could be consistent with age heaping.
In the main analysis, the estimates use repeated cross sections and do not include 1980.
20
Families with (more) girls might be larger if parents follow a son-biased stopping rule (see Clark (2000)
and Barcellos, Carvalho, and Lleras-Muney (2014)). Appendix Figure B6 suggests that such a rule may
have been followed in Turkey in 1985. I include family size and sex composition of siblings in all regressions.
However, unlike other important recent work on sibling rivarly which uses sibling gender or composition as
the main treatment variable, gender is considered a mitigating factor in the analysis herein. The distribution
of vaccine preventable illness interacted with campaign rollout is used for identi…cation. Furthermore, the
spillover analysis focuses on the impact of younger siblings on older siblings, which typically has less selection
bias than estimating the impact of older siblings on younger siblings due to endogenous fertility (see Appendix
Tables V and VI versus III and IV in Vogl (2013)). Nevertheless, the interpretation of gender-speci…c
heterogeneity in response to the campaign would be unclear if the treatment e¤ect was correlated with
either fertility or sex-selection in the data. I …nd no evidence of this (see Appendix Table B3). That
treatment is orthogonal to pregnancy outcomes conditional on covariates is useful to document since there
was a loosening of abortion legislation in Turkey in 1983. (I thank Onur Altindag for the comment).

The inclusion of province of birth …xed e¤ects absorb di¤erences between provinces that
might jointly determine a high baseline VPD prevalence and the accumulation of human
capital. The individual level regressions include cohort …xed e¤ects to control for any other
national policies or events that would a¤ect human capital outcomes in a speci…c year for
children of a given age. The use of province of birth to assign treatment reduces concern
about endogenous migration.
To assess for spillover e¤ects of early child health on older siblings, equation (3) is modi…ed
by replacing Itpost with Itpostspillover with the latter equal to one in census year 1990 for the
cohort immediately older than the age-eligible population and zero for the same age-range
in 1985. The sample includes children of household heads who were 11 to 14 years of age
at the time of the 1985 and 1990 census and had younger siblings in the household. This
age range is ideal since this group is young enough to still be residing with younger siblings
who were targets of the campaign (enabling me to identify those indirectly a¤ected) yet
old enough to be ineligible for the campaign themselves. Note that the design matrix for
the spillover analysis also includes age rank (birth order for those children that are in the
household). In addition, enrollment statistics at the province level were gathered from the
Turkish Statistical Institute (1982) and are described in section 5.
The estimation strategy compares health and human capital outcomes among individuals
born in high versus low prevalence VPD provinces before and after the initiation of the
immunization campaign. In order for the underlying variation in vaccine preventable illnesses
to be useful as a natural experiment, it must be the case that the program had more of an
impact in places where the prevalence of disease was higher. Reports immediately after
the campaign support this idea: "The increases in vaccine percentages that the campaign
has made possible, have been higher in rural areas and in regions where the percentages
were lower before" (Tunçbilek, E et al., 1986, page 36). This is re‡ected in the near total
21

Adding occupation of father and mother’s literacy reduces my sample since some older children move
out of the household. Including these parental characteristics allows a more direct comparision with the
coe¢ cients for the spillover e¤ects in Table 7. Speci…cations that do not include parental characteristics can
be found in Table 6 columns (7) and (8).
22
Pooled models produce the same coe¢ cients as separate regressions but are more e¢ cient assuming the
variance of the residuals is the same between sexes (Franzese and Kam, 2007).

Notes: Panel A data are taken from Ölüm Istatistikleri and plots the relationship between the difference in VPD prevalence
by province between the years 1990 and 1986 on the y-axis and the precampaign VPD prevalence in 1985 on the x-axis.
The one outlier is Mus, which had measles deaths in 1988 and 1989. For all other provinces, vaccine preventable illnesses
essentially dropped to 0 after the campaign. Data from Panel B are from Turkish Censuses and plot the change in the
proportion of the sample that is literate on the y-axis and the pre-campaign VPD prevalence on the x-axis. The Census
samples include individuals 15-19 years of age and post-campaign is defined as those born between 1980 and 1986.

4.1

Constructing Disease Prevalence

To create a measure of prevalence of vaccine preventable diseases prior to the rollout of
the campaign, I use the Turkish Mortality Statistics from 1977 to 1985 (Ölüm Istatistikleri).
These data are collected annually and include number, cause and age of death at the province
level. Using multiple years smooths out the epidemic nature of vaccine preventable illnesses:
y=1985
X
1
V P D deathsyp :
V P D deathsp = 9
y=1977

One feature of statistics from low and middle-income countries is the underreporting of
vital events to local authorities, particularly in rural areas. Although vital events may be
underreported, population counts, enumerated by the federal census, are generally not as
poorly measured. Since incidence and prevalence rates are normalized by population, the
bias introduced by underreporting of vital events is exacerbated by the use of a federal source
for the denominator and a local source for the numerator when attempting to construct a
meaningful epidemiologic or demographic measure.23 To address the problem of nonrandom
23

Poorly recorded vital statistics are also problematic if using disease or death counts on the left-hand side,
even with …xed e¤ects for province, since reporting errors can change over time in ways that are correlated
with health interventions or policies.

15

underreporting of vital events in the administrative data, I exploit a unique question in the
1985 Turkish census to construct a correction factor (CF ). The 1985 enumerators asked
women whether they had given birth in the last 12 months and whether that baby had
survived.24 Assuming that are no systematic di¤erences between underreporting of infant
deaths and deaths from vaccine preventable disease, this ratio can then be used to correct for
Inf ant Deathscensus
p;1985
= CFp;1985 : Validation of this approach
underreporting in rural areas: Inf ant Deathsistatiskleri
p;1985
can be found in Appendix Figures B3 and B4, which show the correlation between the
corrected vital statistics and health indicators from various other sources is much better
than the uncorrected version.
The next step in constructing the prevalence of vaccine preventable disease from deaths
is to use information on the case fatality rate (CF R). The CF R is the number of deaths
divided by the number of cases of the disease, and can be used to scale up fatalities to
represent infections at a particular point in time. One complicating feature is that the CF R
varies across illnesses and age groups. Since the majority of deaths recorded (81%) are from
measles, I focus on literature estimating CF R for that disease. In a recent review by Wolfson,
Grais, Luquero, Birmingham, and Strebel (2009) the median CF R for measles is 16.45 for
children 0 to 11 months and 2.24 for those 48 to 59 months of age. Thus, I use the CF R
speci…c to infants and scale the at risk population accordingly. Prevalence at the province
level is the number of cases divided by the infant population. A map of VPD prevalence
deciles across Turkey prior to the campaign is shown in Figure 5 below.
Figure 5. Map of pre-campaign VPD Prevalence (deciles)

Notes: Map of deciles of VPD prevalence in the pre-campaign period for 67 provinces circa 1985. See text for details
of VPD construction. Darker shades indicate higher prevalence.

Micro-level data on human capital outcomes and other household level controls come
from the 5% Turkish census sample provided by Integrated Public Use Micro Sample (IPUMS)
24

More often the census question asks about the number of children ever born and the number of children
that have survived.

16

and the Turkish Statistical Institute (Minnesota Population Center, 2017). Census data are
available for the years 1985, 1990 and 2000 and include data on literacy, educational attainment (less than primary, primary, secondary and university completed) and disability. To
supplement these data, I also include data on years of schooling from the Demographic and
Health Surveys (DHS) (ICF International, 2003, 1998, 1993) and data on school enrollment
by gender from the Turkish Government. I merge individual observations from the censuses
to the pre-campaign VPD prevalence. Provincial infant and child mortality rates are constructed from individual birth histories collected by the DHS. Time-varying provincial level
data on healthcare access including number of hospitals are from the Turkish Statistical
Abstract (Türkiye Īstatistik Yilli¼
gi) and are also included (TurkStat, 1983, 1989).
The age-eligible sample in the main analysis includes individuals between 15 and 19 years
old across two waves of census data, 1985 and 2000.25 Any individual younger than 15 in
2000 would have been subject to a major education reform in Turkey and must be excluded.26
Furthermore, vaccination continued (though at a diminished level) post-campaign potentially
a¤ecting younger cohorts. Disability is not available in the 1990 census. I restrict the analysis
to children who are still living in their birth province to reduce measurement error (e.g. not
knowing precisely when the child moved) associated with treatment assignment for the main
analysis and make the same restriction for older siblings in the spillover analysis.27 Summary
statistics are provided in Appendix Table B1.28

Results

5.1

E¤ects of the Campaign

The results of equation (2) are presented in Table 2. Consistent with Figure 2, there are
no appreciable e¤ects on the vaccination campaign on child or infant mortality in columns
(4) and (5).29 However, I …nd statistically signi…cant gains for both disability and human
25

Given the age-dependence of human capital accumulation, the analysis centers on children who are of
the same age and uses repeated cross sections from 1985 and 2000.
26
According to Kirdar, Tayfur, and Koç (2011, page 11): "The new compulsory schooling system a¤ected
children who started school at or after September 1993, we assume that children who were born in 1986 or
later were bound by the policy." Note that the youngest child in my sample is born in 1985.
27
For the spillover analysis, I assume that if older children are still living in their birth province then
the household hasn’t moved. This avoids having di¤erent younger children born in di¤erent provinces and
introducing measurement error by choosing one of the younger children’s birth provinces to assign VPD
prevalence.
28
The provinces included in the analysis are the 67 unique provinces that can be followed over the
entirety of the study period. In Appendix Table B2 columns (11) and (12), I collapse the data to 61 mega
- provinces. This collapse attempts to account for cleavages and combinations between provinces over time,
but introduces additional measurement error into the baseline VPD estimates. The results are comparable
to Table 5 columns (1) and (4).

VPD prevalence is insigni…cant except for the outcome of disability which lends support to
the identifying assumption that, in the absence of the campaign, groups with high and low
vaccine preventable illness would have experienced similar changes in the outcome variables.
Based on the low overall fatality rate from vaccine preventable disease in Turkey at this
time, in retrospect, the results on mortality may not appear particularly surprising.

5.2

Threats to Identi…cation

In order for the estimates to be interpreted as causal e¤ects, it must be that VPD prevalence
in the pre-campaign period is as good as randomly assigned conditional on covariates and
places of varying pre-campaign VPD prevalence must be on parallel trends. Table 3 addresses
the …rst claim. Column (1) presents summary statistics for the age-eligible province level
sample used in Table 2. In column (2) I regress each covariate on VPD prevalence alone
30

Disability has a low mean (approximately 1% of the sample) in the census. It is important to note that,
like the case fatality rate, disability from vaccine preventable illnesses is much lower than their incidence and
overall morbidity. There is precedent for using disability in the census to measure the impact of infectious
disease at the population level (Almond, 2006).

18

and in column (3) I include all other covariates in the analysis. Although pre-campaign
VPD prevalence is positively associated with less human capital and larger families, once
conditioning on covariates, VPD prevalence fails to predict most of the variables in the precampaign period, except for disability (the implicit …rst stage) and a binary variable for
whether the father is in a skilled occupation.

that I am limited in the use of adjacent cohorts due to spillover e¤ects to older siblings as
demonstrated below). The results are shown in Table 4 – the interaction of placebo post
and VPD prevalence is no longer a signi…cant predictor of morbidity or human capital.

Notes: OLS estimates of equation (2) estimated on individuals born between 1961 and 1970. Placebo
post is an indicator variable equal to one if the year of birth is greater than or equal to 1966. Literacy,
disability and educational attainment are from the Turkish Census. In addition to the variables shown
(VPD prevalence, post and the interaction), the regression also controls for fraction female, average
maternal literacy, family size, paternal occupational status, and log of total hospitals per capita.
Regressions are weighted by the relevant cell size in columns (1) to (3). Standard errors clustered at
the province level.
* ** *** represent significance at the 10, 5 and 1 percent level, respectively.

I next turn to estimating the impact of the campaign using micro-level data from individuals. These speci…cations allows for the inclusion of time-varying provincial level variables
which may be a source of omitted variable bias such as mother’s literacy, father’s occupational status, family size, gender, age rank and fraction girl siblings (LeVine and Rowe, 2009;
Black and Devereux, 2011). Table 5 reports results for three outcomes: disabled, literate and
educational attainment. Columns (1) (4) and (7) estimate equation (3). A one standard
deviation increase of vaccine preventable illness in the pre-campaign period was associated
with approximately a 5% decline in disability, a 3% increase in literacy and a 2% increase
in educational attainment. The low overall mean of disability in the population (about 1%)
likely re‡ects under-reporting. If this under-reporting is worse in areas that were heavily
impacted by the campaign, areas with high VPD prevalence at baseline, this would weaken
my ability to detect an e¤ect of the campaign.
Columns (2) (5) and (8) estimate equation (4) and formally test whether the marginal
e¤ect of the campaign di¤ered for boys versus girls. For disability, the impact of the campaign
for girls is indistinguishable of that for boys. Yet the marginal e¤ect for girls is statistically
signi…cant when the outcome is literacy or education. How could boys have similar health
gains but smaller human capital gains from the campaign? There are a few possibilities.
For instance, discrimination or higher returns to boys in the labor market could create a
20

di¤erential health threshold to educate boys versus girls. Another possibility is that girls are
bene…tting from the campaign through an additional channel that is not related to improved
own health. Put di¤erently, the estimates below might re‡ect both direct and spillover
e¤ects for girls, but mostly direct health bene…ts for boys. Note that vaccination continued
for children born after 1985, and therefore these individuals likely bene…tted from having
healthier younger children in their household – a hypothesis this paper is focused on and
is examined in detail below.31 Tentative support for such a possibility is provided by the
gender-family size interactions: larger families have a much more negative impact on girls’
human capital than boys’. Furthermore, for 15 to 19 year olds with few younger children in
the household, the direct e¤ects of the campaign are observed (columns (3) (6) and (9)) but
the gender-speci…c e¤ects are absent (e.g. 1 is signi…cant, but 2 is not).
A series of robustness checks are performed in Table 6 and in the Appendix. First,
Kurdish areas are dropped in columns (1) and (2). Although literacy is no longer statistically
signi…cant; the point estimate is comparable to baseline. In Appendix Table B2 one region
is dropped at a time. The results are generally robust, except the results on literacy are
weakened when dropping the entire Eastern region of the country (e.g. dropping 17 of 67
provinces). This region had the highest VPD prevalence and lowest literacy rates prior to
the campaign. Second, I add birth province interacted with a linear trend for year of birth.
Literacy retains signi…cance and the expected sign, but disability ‡ips signs and is no longer
signi…cant. Columns (5) and (6) adjust for mean reversion by interacting post with regional
averages of the outcome variables calculated using the pre-period sample. The results are
robust to controlling for mean reversion using this approach. Results are similar but not
quantitatively signi…cant when including province-level averages of the outcome from the
pre-period interacted with post. The last two columns drop all parental controls increasing
the sample size. Results for disability are no longer statistically signi…cant but are similar
in magnitude to the baseline; results for literacy are still signi…cant.

Spillovers to Older Siblings

5.3.1

Census Data

I next turn to elucidating whether the intervention had an impact on older siblings of children age-eligible for the intervention by using equations (3) and (4) and replacing Itpost with
Itpostspillover as described above. The results are reported in Table 7. Panel A reports OLS
estimates for the outcome literate and Panel B reports the results for the outcome of educational attainment. I cannot test for spillover e¤ects on disability since it was not reported
in the 1990 census.
In column (1), the spillover di¤erence-in-di¤erences estimate is positive and signi…cant.
Moving to speci…cation (4) in column (2), these results are driven by 2 , the additional

spillover e¤ect for girls, since 1 is small and not statistically signi…cant. The di¤erential
spillover e¤ect of the campaign on literacy for girls (0:0058) is signi…cant at the 5% level.
The total spillover e¤ect for adolescent girls who were not age-eligible for the vaccination
campaign is approximately 45% as large as the total e¤ect for girls who were age-eligible for
the health intervention. The results in Panel B display a similar pattern, with the spillover
e¤ect explaining much of the gender-speci…c age-eligible result.
The results imply the spillover bene…ts of young children’s health on the human capital
of older siblings in the household accrued exclusively to girls. To probe mechanisms which
might explain such a pattern, I limit the analysis to a subsample of children whose mothers
state they work outside the home. This widens this gender di¤erence (column (3)) as does
restricting to cotton-growing areas in column (4) of Panels A and B.32
Other researchers have pointed out the importance of grandmothers for girls’ health.
Du‡o (2003) …nds that the anthropometrics of girl grandchildren living with grandmothers
newly eligible for pension funds in South Africa improve substantially, whereas boys’health
does not respond. There is also anecdotal evidence that grandmothers assist mothers in
rearing children and therefore may function as maternal substitutes. Motivated by this
evidence, I compare the gender-speci…c spillover e¤ect of the campaign in households with a
grandmother (column (5)) or with an older sister (column (6)). When grandmothers or older
sisters are present, the gender-speci…c spillover e¤ects dissipate entirely. There is a genderneutral spillover e¤ect when grandmothers are present and this is likely due to the fact that
grandmothers are present in households which are on average much larger than household
without grandmothers. In contrast to older sisters, when older brothers are present (column
(7)), the magnitude of the gender-speci…c spillover e¤ect increases. Column (8) is included
as a placebo test. If there are no young children in the household, spillover e¤ects should be
absent. This prediction is largely borne out in the data. For literacy there is not a genderspeci…c spillover e¤ect but a small (in magnitude) and marginally signi…cant 1 e¤ect. For
educational attainment, 1 and 2 are both small and insigni…cant. Taken together, these
results lend support to the notion that older sisters bene…tted from the campaign and the
mechanism is via their time allocation shifting from domestic work to education.

It is estimated that 80% of the workforce that is engaged in cotton harvesting in Turkey are women

Figure 6 plots the marginal spillover e¤ect of the campaign on girls versus boys by
the number of siblings 10 years of age and under for the literacy outcome.33 The results
demonstrate a pattern consistent with Figure 1 –namely, the bene…ts of mass dissemination
of the vaccine technology were higher for girls than boys and this di¤erence increased in the
number of young, potentially treated children in the household. A linear estimation of the
same pattern is shaded and superimposed on the …gure.

Evidence from Demographic and Health Surveys

I supplement the spillover analysis using the household …les from the DHS.34 These data
have number of years of education and harmonized education levels, which allows for an
exploration of where in the years of schooling distribution the campaign may have had an
33

This includes those directly vaccinated as part of the campaign (those 5-9 years old) as well as those
who were vaccinated in the follow-up period (under-…ves) who also bene…tted from less vaccine preventable
illness among their school age siblings (5-9 years years old).
34
The female …le has somewhat richer data than the household …le (e.g. anthropometrics) but is only for
ever married women in most years except 1998.

26

e¤ect. To do so I use the years of schooling variable, which has a range from 0 to 20 and derive
from that those who have received no school, those who obtained at least the compulsory
education amount (5 years of primary school) and years of education above the compulsory
cuto¤. Similar to the main results, I include those who remain in province of birth or
childhood to reduce measurement error in treatment assignment. I compare individuals
born between 1971 and 1980 in the 2008 DHS to those born between 1961 to 1970 in the
1998 DHS (ages 28 to 37). This treatment group was chosen since these individuals would
have been just outside the age eligible window for vaccination at the time of the campaign. I
de…ne the spillover and control cohort over a longer period of time than the census because of
the smaller overall sample size and because there is more measurement error in the de…nition
of treatment in the DHS since I cannot recreate sibship structure during the campaign.35
Table 8 estimates equation (4). Moving across the columns, the results suggest that the
spillover e¤ects of the campaign induced women to attend school (on the extensive margin)
and complete at least compulsory education. On the other hand, in column (3) there is
no compelling evidence the campaign had a gender-speci…c spillover impact on years of
education beyond the compulsory cuto¤. Indeed, beyond compulsory education, the total
spillover e¤ect is negative, though the comparator group includes those that completed
primary school.

Having two censuses …ve years apart is particularly advantageous for examining spillover e¤ects. The
spillover cohorts across the censuses (1970-1974 for the control and 1975-1979 for the treatment) can be fairly
close in time and age. The DHS corroborates the census …ndings while providing a …ner outcome measure

Enrollment Statistics

Enrollment numbers by gender, grade and year are available from the National Education
Statistics of Formal Education collected by the Turkish Government. I examine how the
ratio of gender parity in primary level …ve enrollment (corresponding to children age 11)
changes over time. Children in this age range would have been eligible caretakers for sick
children if parental time inputs were insu¢ cient yet should not have been direct recipients
of the vaccines. I regress the enrollment ratio of girls and boys on the interaction of baseline
vaccine preventable disease and a post dummy for 1985 (as in equation (2)) as well as province
and year …xed e¤ects. Figure 7 shows how the ratio evolves over time. The results from this
regression yield a point estimate 0.016 and a standard error of 0.006.

5.4

Alternative Explanations for Gendered Spillover E¤ects

There are several competing theories that might explain the gendered e¤ects on health
and human capital presented above. First, poor health is a negative income shock for a
household (Robinson and Yeh, 2011). When children are sick less often, and assuming girls’
schooling is more income elastic than boys’, parents who would not educate girl children in
lean times may now have the resources to do so. However, evidence supporting the income
mechanism is scant. To start, most families in the 1993 Turkish DHS treated children
with low-cost medical therapies (e.g. antibiotics and oral rehydration therapy (ORT)) or
home remedies for common child ailments (respiratory and diarrheal symptoms). For more
serious manifestations of disease that are more costly to treat, over 90% of hospitalizations
for pneumonia and dehydration took place in the heavily subsidized public sector. Yet the
time costs to care for sick young children are not trivial as described below. Empirically,
the campaign does not a¤ect the professional status of either parent or their labor force
participation (see Appendix Table B4).
Taste-based discrimination provides another competing explanation for the results. A
convenient way to model such discrimination is to assume that there is a higher health
threshold to educate girls than boys or to assume that families place higher weights on boy
children.36 Indeed, Appendix Table B5 demonstrates the e¤ect of disability on literacy is
more negative for girls than boys and this could be a possible reason for the gendered direct
e¤ects of the campaign demonstrated in Tables 5 and 6. Although, taste-based discrimination
would reinforce these …ndings (or potentially explain the gendered division of intrahousehold
production), on its own, it fails to predict spillover bene…ts accruing only to older sisters.
Epidemiological spillovers are the most likely alternative explanation for my results. If
older sisters are spending a substantial amount of time with younger siblings, they would
also receive the greatest health bene…ts from the reduction in contagious disease once those
young children are vaccinated. Although di¢ cult to disprove, since the 1990 census does
not include disability, it must be recognized that the epidemiological argument nests the
hypothesis I test above, namely, that older sisters are doing much more caretaking which
places them at heightened risk. However, given the U-shaped pattern of morbidity from
infectious diseases –with school-age children typically having mild manifestations and most
school-aged kids already possessing immunity via vaccination or direct disease exposure, the
health bene…ts of the campaign for this population would have been limited.37
36

See Alesina and Ferrara (2014) for a model of di¤erent threshold e¤ects applied to judicial racial
discrimination. In the extreme, it could be that girls will only be educated if they are not disabled but boys
will always be educated despite disability.
37
For example, the age-speci…c complication rate of measles (which is the most prevalent and well documented of all vaccine preventable illnesses) demonstrates a stark U-shaped pattern, with infants and young
toddlers having the highest complication rate (41.4%) compared to those in the 10-19 year old range (
12.8%) or older adults (34.4%) (Orenstein, Perry, and Halsey, 2004). Measles is so highly contagious that
most middle school age children would have already been naturally exposed, and exposure to naturally occuring measles virus is considered to confer lifelong immunity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

29

5.5

Under-Five Morbidity in Developing Countries and the Protective E¤ect of Immunization

For the mechanism outlined above to be plausible, it must be that children under-…ve are
sick either acutely but frequently or chronically; that such sickness leads to health-seeking
and caretaking behaviors which place increasing demands on a mother’s time, that daughters
are viewed as substitute mothers and that sickness can be interrupted by targeted policies
which improve child health, such as an immunization campaign. According to the 1993
Turkish DHS, approximately 51% of children under-…ve had one or more illness episodes in
the two week interval preceding the interview. These illness episodes included diarrhea, fever
and cough. To assess the correlation between vaccination status and illness, I regressed an
indicator for any illness in the last two weeks on gender of child, age of child and number
of vaccines received. The vaccines included were those distributed during the campaign:
DPT, measles and polio, as well as BCG (Bacille Calmette Guerin), a vaccination against
tuberculosis. Children under-…ve were 2 percentage points less likely to experience an illness
in the last two weeks for each additional vaccine they had received (coe¢ cient of 0:021 and
standard error of 0:004). Sex and age of child were also statistically signi…cant, with older
age and girl sex suggestive of a protective e¤ect.38 Based on these results, a child who was
fully vaccinated during the campaign had a 14 percentage point reduction in acute illness
episodes.
Not all illness episodes require trips to the doctor. Among children with episodes of
cough or fever in the last two weeks, 63% received some treatment and 35% received medical treatment. For episodes of diarrhea, 72% of children received treatment though only
25% received medical treatment. However, it’s important to note that many e¤ective interventions are time-intensive. ORT for diarrhea is one such example. Infants and young
children must be fed the solution every few minutes.39
In addition to acute illness, vaccine preventable illnesses can rarely result in chronic
disease with ongoing caregiving needs. Paralysis from polio is perhaps the most well-known.
It is estimated that 1 in 4 people become symptomatic with polio virus though only 1 in 200
will be paralyzed and only 2 to 10% of those with paralysis die due to di¢ culty breathing
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). Measles can lead to a severe pneumonia
and, in 1 of every 1000 children, an encephalitis that can result in deafness, brain damage
and intellectual disability. Hypoxia and ensuing brain sequelae can also rarely occur from
the violent cough associated with pertussis.
Other studies have found evidence consistent with the notion that girls step in to perform

Assessing which vaccines are most protective is beyond the scope of the current paper.

Approximately 7:8% of all children under-…ve had visited a hospital for treatment. If a child is hospitalized, many developing countries rely on mothers to provide inpatient nursing, including meal preparation,
medication administration and laundry.

housekeeping and childcare chores when a mother is absent. Gertler, Levine, and Ames
(2004) using data from Indonesia, found that although daughters in general were not more
likely than sons to drop out of school if a parent died, daughters with younger siblings were
more likely to do so. They relate this …nding to ethnographic literature in Indonesia which
places the burden of household duties on older girls. Such norms are also prevalent in Turkey,
especially during the time of the campaign: According to Fernea (1995, p. 263), "Young girls
help their mothers with the housework and take care of younger siblings." The interaction
of norms, technology and illness can plausibly explain the gender-speci…c spillover e¤ect
observed in the analysis.

Policy Implications and Concluding Remarks

Several studies in economics have documented unintended consequences of technological …xes
for public health problems (Field, Glennerster, and Hussam, 2011; Lakdawalla, Sood, and
Goldman, 2006). This article investigated the impact of the Turkish National Immunization
Campaign on health and human capital through the lens of cultural norms and incorporating
disease dynamics. The campaign was prompted by innovation in vaccine development and
delivery and was instituted with broad-based political and religious support. Vaccination
distribution was near universal but occurred in an environment where gender roles were
concretized early.
Although the documented gains in vaccine coverage for under-…ve children were impressive, I …nd no evidence that the intended reduction in infant mortality was realized. The
impacts on disability and human capital were signi…cant and the latter e¤ect was not limited
to the targeted population: older sisters of age-eligible recipients also bene…tted relative to
older brothers. The results were interpreted within a model of intrahousehold allocation of
scarce time resources and specialization. Gender-speci…c spillover e¤ects increased in the
number of younger siblings and if the mother worked outside the home and were absent in
the presence of older female caregivers and if younger children were not present –providing
empirical support for the proposed mechanism. Although other forces for convergence could
have been at play, the pattern of accentuation and attenuation of gendered spillover e¤ects
as the time budget of mothers tighten and slacken, respectively, is striking and its interpretation is consistent with the gendered division of household tasks commonly observed in
microdata from low- and middle-income countries. The observation that girls gained compulsory education, but nothing more, points to important interactions between education
and health policy.
As child survival continues to increase in developing countries, emphasis will gradually
shift from decreasing mortality to reducing morbidity. The spillover e¤ects of the campaign
on the human capital of older girl siblings suggests that individuals most often tasked with
caring for young children when they are ill will also disproportionately bene…t from their
31

health improvement. These unanticipated outcomes provide yet another reason to look beyond mortality to other outcomes (namely, education and gender equity) when modeling or
assessing the full impact of the broad-based distribution of early childhood health technologies in low-and middle-income countries.40
