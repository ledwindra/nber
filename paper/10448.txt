High-Frequency Contagion Between the Exchange Rates and Stock Prices
Yuko Hashimoto and Takatoshi Ito
NBER Working Paper No. 10448
April 2004
JEL No. F31, G12, G15
ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes the co-movement of the exchange rates and the stock prices from the
viewpoint of contagion among the eight countries in the region during the period of Asian currency
crisis, 1997-1999. Ito and Hashimoto (2002; NBER working paper) proposed a new definition of
high-frequency contagion using daily exchange rate data.
This paper extends the idea to include the stock market origins that are separately identified
for the exchange rate and the stock price. Then contagion is defined not only among the exchange
rates and stock prices separately, but also between an exchange rate and a stock price of the same
country or of different countries. One of the motivations is the following observation. Hong Kong
successfully defended the peg to the U.S. dollar throughout the Asian currency crisis period.
However, the Hong Kong stock market was affected by the decline in currencies of neighboring
countries, most notably in October 1997.
We use a friction model and a Tobit model to analyze the impact of a negative shock in one
asset price to others. The difference between mildly-affected countries and severely-affected
countries is analyzed; categories of large declines in the exchange rates (or stock prices) are made
differentiated; and whether the stock prices were increasing or decreasing is distinguished. It is
found, among others, that there was, in general, the contagion between the exchange rates and stock
prices; that the stock prices in Hong Kong were found to suffer from contagious effects from the
decline in the Asian currencies; and that Indonesian, Korean and Thai currency depreciation and
Hong Kong stock price declines had impacts on other currencies and stock prices in the region
during the crisis period.

1. Introduction
Frequent currency crises among the emerging market economies have become one of the most
important global financial problems in the 1990s.

Most prominent crises include Mexico in 1994;

Thailand, Korea, and Indonesia in 1997; Russia in 1998; Brazil in 1999; and Argentina in
2001-2002. Among them, the Asian crisis differs from other crises in its speed, depth and width of
contagion: there are many studies on the currency crisis and its contagious effect as described in,
for example, Corsetti, Pesenti and Roubini (1998a, b), Flood and Marion (1998), Radelet and Sachs
(1998), Ito (1999, 2000), Ito and Hashimoto(2002), to name a few.

In particular, the simultaneous

occurrence of a currency crisis and financial (banking) sector crisis triggered the sharp drop in
stock prices in the crisis region. The most remarkable feature of the recent crisis is the
simultaneous fall of currency and stock prices in the region. Of course, the simultaneous fall of
stock prices and currencies, that is contagion of different asset prices, is by no means limited to the
crisis period or crisis-hit countries. As we all know, the world-wide stock market declines were
apparent during the Depression and the Black Monday. During the even more stable period,
movements in the prices of different assets—currencies and equities—are likely to influence
directly each other in the major markets.1 The comovement of asset prices is found to become
more strengthened during the unstable period in 1980s and 1990s. According to Rigobon (2003),
the contemporaneous responses of daily return of stock prices from 1994 to 2001 in Latin
American and Asian countries are found to have strengthened when markets are more volatile. The
contemporaneous interactions between stock prices and exchange rates in a crisis-hit country
emerge on the presumption of the strong interconnections between asset prices.

When the currency of one country depreciates sharply, or becomes a target of speculative attacks,
the authorities are likely to raise interest rate in an attempt to reduce the capital outflow (or
increase capital inflow) so that a further depreciation can be avoided. The higher interest rate,

Rigobon (2002).

however, may put a downward pressure on its stock prices. Even if the country survives the
speculative pressure on exchange rate, the financial market may suffer the negative shock by the
turndown of the stock price, as evidenced by the Hong Kong in October 1997 and the summer of
1998.

In August 1998, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and equivalent of a central bank, has

purchased stocks to defend the financial markets from the so-called double-play—simultaneous
attack on the currency and equity markets. Did Hong Kong suffer the Asian currency crisis? No, in
terms of exchange rate depreciation, but yes in the stock price declines. The contagion effect can be
said to have had a great impact even in Hong Kong.

Stock price declines sometimes works as a leading indicator of crises. The slowdown of economy
affects stock prices, investors pull their capital out of the country, putting a downward pressure on
the currency.

In the case of Thailand, the stock price was at its peak in mid-1990s and had fallen

by half on the eve of crisis. The substantial decline of stock prices for three years led the weakened
economy into another recession and finally plunged into currency crisis.

However, in the other

cases, the stock prices only reacted to the currency crisis, such as in Indonesia.

The sharp

depreciations triggered insolvency of corporations and banks that had currency mismatch on their
balance sheets. The stock prices fell once the currency depreciated sharply. Thus, by examining the
stock price reactions and exchange rate behaviors, we gain a more detailed insight in the crisis
contagion. There are at least five channels of spillovers among the foreign exchange rates and the
stock prices. The first channel is the spillover effect from the exchange rate shock to stock prices.
The second channel is the one from the stock price shocks to the exchange rate, based on the
perspective that the stock price reflects economic fundamentals. The third channel originates from
the third factor (other than shocks in foreign exchange market/stock market), e.g., Monetary policy.
The fourth channel is contagion among the currencies, which was the topic of Ito and Hashimoto
(2002), and others. The final transmission channel is cross-border contagion among different stock
markets.

This paper examines the contagion between the exchange rates and stock prices during Asian crisis.
Ito and Hashimoto (2002) proposed a method to identify the direction of causality among
currencies in crisis.

The paper expands to examine interaction between the exchange rate

depreciations and stock price declines. The existing literature that focuses on the correlations
between the exchange rates and stock prices during crises lacks the viewpoint to analyze the
cause-and-effect relationship. The existing papers provide little evidence to substantiate
high-frequent spillover from an origin country to other countries. In this paper, we identify the
interconnections

between

stock

and

foreign

exchange

markets

and

characterize

the

contemporaneous responses of each market during the crisis period.

There are two branches of the empirical literature that closely relate to this paper. The first one
addresses the interaction between the exchange rate market and stock market. Rigobon (1999)
analyzes the crises contagion using vector-autoregressions (VAR), taking into account the omitted
variables and heteroskedasticity to claim the evidence of stock market contagion during the Asian
crisis. Pavlova and Rigobon (2003) shows that the exchange rates serve as a transmission channel
of stock price movements. The second one is the estimation methodology. Most of the previous
studies use the VAR methodology, which only prove (or disprove) the presence of correlation in the
financial markets. Our methodology has several advantages over VAR. First, the dependent
variable in our model is constructed to capture only large responses, eliminating noises. Second,
the origin of shocks and the causality direction is determined by comparing daily changes of the
exchange rates (or stock prices) before running regressions. Third, by employing these steps, the
number of explanatory variables is less than VAR, so that the estimation is done efficiently.
2

2

Khalid and Kawai(2003), for example, analyze the crisis contagion among 9 Asian countries
based on VAR and conclude that there was no spillover effect between stock markets and foreign
exchange markets during the 1997 crisis. The difficulty with their VAR estimation is the use of too
many (27) explanatory variables in the model--- 3 variables (daily stock prices, exchange rates and
interest rates) for 9 countries. The inclusion of the autoregressive terms in the model also weakens
to significantly detect the underlying relationship.
4/37

Other macro-based empirical analyses suffer from lack of explanatory variables when
high-frequency (daily) data is used. Kaminsky and Reinhart (2003) investigates the spillover
effects of stock price returns using Logit estimation and find that US, Japan and Germany markets
plays an important role in the spillover relationships in the case of Brazil, Thailand and Russian
crises.

This paper investigates the interaction between the exchange rates and stock market prices in Asian
financial markets using daily observations in the aftermath of the 1997 crisis. Based on the concept
of “origin” and “affected” in the spillover relationship, developed in Ito and Hashimoto (2002), we
will be able to identify contagion causality within the day.

We first estimate the contagion

threshold for the depreciations (and stock price declines), so that we can identify whether the
change in exchange rate (and stock price) movements was due to contagion or a noise. Then, the
model identifies the causes of contagion—which factor most likely affects economies of
neighboring countries, the hard-hit (origin) country, the trend in the market, other countries.

The

model predicts that the exchange rates and stock prices are correlated internationally even at a
high-frequency (daily) level, providing support to theoretical inferences in favor of financial
contagion between foreign exchange market and stock market.

Major findings of this paper are as follows.

First, the Indonesian, Korean and Thai exchange rates

had large impacts on the stock prices of other countries, while other currencies did not have
impacts on stock prices of other countries. Second, the Hong Kong stock market was significantly
affected by the Indonesian, Korean, and Thai depreciation. Therefore, the contagion effect of Asian
crisis can be said to have a great impact even in Hong Kong. Third, the Indonesian and Korean, but
not Thai, exchange rates had impacts on other currencies in the region.

This may be contrary to

casual observation that the currency crisis spread from Thailand to other countries in the second

5/37

half of 1997.

Fourth, contagion among stock markets was not significant for most pairs of the

countries. Fifth, Hong Kong stock price was found to have substantial effects on Asian exchange
rates in the midst of crisis. Sixth, Thai exchange rates were quite sensitive to shocks in stock prices
of other countries.

Seventh, other than Hong Kong stock price effects on other currencies, and

any stock price shocks on the Thai currencies, the spillovers from the stock price shocks to the
exchange rate were not significant.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, movements of the exchange rates and
stock prices of the region during the crisis period are reviewed. In Section 3, we present the
estimation methodology used in this paper. Section 4 shows the results of estimations based on the
Tobit equation that include contagion terms. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2. Data and Empirical Evidence of Currencies and Stock Prices
The data set used in this paper consists of two time-series, the nominal exchange rates (vis-à-vis
US dollar) and stock price indices3 of eight Asian countries; Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. The data source is Datastream. The
sample period is from January 4, 1994 to July 7, 1999 for stock prices and from June 30, 1997 to
July 7, 1999 for exchange rates.

Figure1-1 shows the exchange rates of eight currencies against the US dollar from June 30, 1997 to
July 7, 1999. They are normalized at 100 at beginning of the sample period. As is well known, most
of the Asian countries suffered the series of speculative attacks that led to the floatation
(devaluation) of their currencies after July 1997, although the rate of devaluation and depreciation
through the crisis period varied considerably across the countries and the sample period. Most

Asian countries had recovered the stability of their currencies as the nation's economy got back on
a recovery track by summer 1998.

The behavior of stock prices for the sample period does not show a pattern that is commonly found
among currencies. As Figure 1-2 clearly shows, some stock price rose over a few years before the
Asian currency crisis and others showed relatively stable behavior of stock prices. Overall, the
stock prices of most of the East Asian countries did not show the consistent downward trend,
except Thailand, until the onset of crisis. From October, 1996, Thailand began to become an origin
of a stock price decline in the region.

In April and July 1997, decline in stock prices contagiously

spilled over to the Philippines and then Indonesia in August 1997. From September 1997, the stock
prices continued falling more rapidly in Malaysia, Indonesia, and South Korea. The magnitude of
stock price declines was eased after December 1998. While the currency crisis in the summer of
1997 accelerated a drop in stock prices in each of the Asian countries, stock prices went back up
again in the mid-1998 due to the recovery of macro economy in each country.

Figure1-1, and Figure1-2, inserted here

Examining these figures, the exchange rate devaluations of Thailand, the Philippines, and
Indonesia seemed preceded by the stock price declines in 1997.4 For example, the fall of stock
prices in Thailand first appeared in late 1996 and continued in the first half of 1997, prior to the
floatation of the currency on July 2. As for the Philippines, before it experienced a large
devaluation in September 1997, the stock price showed a large fall in April and July in 1997. The
Indonesian currency dragged down by Thai baht in mid-August and then slumped to a historic low
after November, with preceding fall of stock prices in early August and in September.

The decline in stock prices in Asia in mid October, 1997, was a spillover from a sharp drop of
Hong Kong stock prices.

Linkage among financial markets---between currency markets and stock markets---is of great
interest, while the definition of the contagion is yet to be well-established. Many previous studies
used, for example, the size of correlation coefficients or rate of change as a measure, which lacks to
identify the causes and the crisis spillover channel. This paper uses the definition first developed by
Ito and Hashimoto (2002).

We first identify the origin of the depreciation (stock price decline)

and then statistically analyze the causes and the propagation of a crisis. We also investigate the
interaction between exchange rate behaviors and stock price movements during the crisis and
non-crisis periods. Since the high-frequency dynamics of exchange rate and stock prices includes a
noise behavior, it is difficult to identify whether a big depreciation (stock price decline) arises from
a shock or it is only a noise. Therefore, by using econometric methodology, we calculate the level
of threshold of contagion that allows us to identify the contagion from the noise. We then estimate
the relationship between the exchange rates and stock prices and find out whether there existed
contagion, how large was the effect, and what likely explains the contagion.

3. The Model
3-1. Origin of Crisis
Following the concept of contagion by Ito and Hashimoto (2002) that a financial crisis appears to
transmit from the hard-hit country to others, we first calculate the rate of depreciation (decline in
stock prices) to identify the “origin”, the hardest-hit country, and the “affected” on the same day.
First, daily percentage change of the exchange rate (or the stock price) is written as:

DR(t,j) = R(t, j) - R(t-1, j),

5 Ito and Hashimoto (2002) first provide the methodology to demonstrate clear cause-and-effect
relationship in exchange rate depreciation (stock price declines) spillover relationship. We also
found a positive relationship between trade link indices and the contagion coefficients, implying
that the bilateral trade linkage is an important crisis transmission channel in the exchange rate
markets.

8/37

where R(t,j) is log of the nominal exchange rate with respect to the US dollar (or the stock price) of
country j at date t. The weighted cumulative change, DRR(t,j), is computed as the weighted
cumulative change with the declining weights of past DRs:

DRR(t,j) = 0.5DR (t,j) + 0.25DR (t-1,j) + 0.125DR (t-2,j) + 0.0625DR (t-3,j) + 0.0625DR (t-4,j).

Then, the largest DRR for day t among different countries is selected as an origin, if it exceeds 2%
in depreciation (or declines) and denoted as DOR. In many days, there is no DOR because none of
DRRs exceeds 2%.

Table 1-1, Table 1-2

Table 1-1 and Table 1-2 list the origins of exchange rate depreciation and stock price
declines. The table makes it possible to pin down the crisis date in each country. Countries that
experienced the hardest-hit was Thailand in July 1997, Indonesia in August-September 1997, Korea
from October 1997 to January 1998, and again Indonesia after January 1998. As is clear from Table
1-2 that a large fall in stock prices was triggered by the currency crisis. The frequency of large
declines (origin) soared after the Thai crisis and as the contagion of exchange rate depreciation
spread in the region, the downward pressure on stock prices was further intensified in Malaysia,
Korea, and Indonesia.

3-2. Friction Model
Since the exchange rates and stock prices follow random walk, the error term in the daily rate of
change may contain a nuisance noise in the data generating process. For example, the reaction of
Asian foreign exchange market was too excessive following the floatation of 1997 in a reflection of
the crisis as well as the exchange rate regime changes. Also, the stock prices were more volatile

9/37

during that period. In many studies, the dummy variable(s) that represents the state of the economy,
crisis or not, is used to focus on the behaviors during crises. Others set an arbitral threshold, e.g., a
3% or more of daily change, to define the contagion.

In this paper, we employ the more practical approach to account for the noise in the exchange rate
and stock price behavior. In the model, the rate of change (of exchange rates or stock prices) is
specified by the following: contagious depreciation (stock price fall), no-significant contagion, and
contagious appreciation (rise in stock prices). Thus, there are three types of observations. What we
first do is to estimate the level of threshold in order to classify the daily rate of change for the
sample period into contagion or the noise. The estimation model is written as following:

y* = x' b + e
y* < a1

y<0

(1)

a1 ≤ y* ≤ a 2

y=0

(2)

a2 < y *

y>0

(3).

Here y* is the observed rate of change in exchange rates or stock prices; that is, y* =
DRR(t)-DRR(t-1). In the equations above, a1 and a2 represent the level of threshold. We regard
changes in the currency (stock prices) as spillover, or contagion, only when they exceed the
threshold.

That is, if the rate of change, y*, exceeds a1 or falls below a2, it is inferred as due to

the spillover effect, not the noise, provided that there is a larger changes in the asset price of
somewhere else.
Equation (1) is the case where either the exchange rate contagiously appreciates or the
stock price contagiously rises. Equation (2) is the case of no significant change in exchange
rates/stock prices, and equation (3) is the case either the depreciation or the fall in stock prices.

The high-frequency behavior of exchange rates and stock prices of one country can be attributed to,

10/37

for example, the closing (previous day) exchange rates and stock prices, the exchange rates and
stock prices of neighboring countries, and the effect of hard-hit country. In the model, we consider
the three types of explanatory variables: (i) difference between the domestic stock prices and other
Asian stock prices, (ii) difference between the home exchange rate and other Asian exchange rates,
and (iii) “Origin” of exchange rates and stock prices.

The first and second explanatory variables, (i) and (ii), account for the difference between the home
and other Asian countries. In the midst of crisis, a country with overvalued stock prices and
exchange rates is more likely to be a candidate of speculative attack regardless of macroeconomic
performance of the country. In the financial market, investors often pull their capital out of
countries in the same region after one country is hit by a crisis. Investors’ perception of
overvaluation depends on several factors, but the relatively smaller rate of depreciation (stock price
fall) may be one of the signals that investors would assess the country as overvalued. The third
variable considers the impact of the origin country. It is a dummy variable.

In estimating the threshold, we further assume the symmetric response in the market. That is, the
magnitude of the impact to either appreciation (rise in stock prices) or depreciation (fall of stock
prices) is the same: a1= -a2. Then, the log-likelihood will be:

ln L =

∑

ln{φ[

y * + a1 − x' b 1
] }

σ

i∈( y *i < a1 )

] },

i∈( a2 < y*i )

]}

where x= [FXKAIRI, SPKAIRI, FXORIGIN, SPORIGIN]’. FXKAIRI and SPKAIRI are variables
indicating differences between the home and other Asian countries’ exchange rates (stock prices).
More precisely, they are defined as a difference between DRR of home country and averaged DRR
of other Asian countries. FXORIGIN and SPORIGIN are dummy variables.

3-3. Tobit estimation
In this section, the impact of the large devaluation (the fall of stock price) of one country to other
countries is examined. The model incorporates the idea of contagion—when the five-day weighted
average of devaluation (stock price fall) breaks the barrier, it may be due to the contagion. In the
estimation, we examine whether the differences between the domestic stock prices and other Asian
stock prices, (domestic exchange rate and other Asian exchange rates), and “Origin” country were
statistically more likely to attribute the possibility of contagion. The dependent variable used in the
estimation was predicted using a previously estimated Friction model and is thus available for all
countries, whether contagion exists or not.

The daily changes of the stock prices and exchange rates in one country may follow the process
that contains two parts: the autoregressive part and non-linear response to large shocks. First, the
small changes of day t-1 in the exchange rates and the stock prices in one country in relative to
other countries will have impacts on today’s exchange rate.

If the currency of one country

depreciates with other currencies in the region, the trade competitiveness and corporate profitability
does not change, so that today’s exchange will be little affected.

On the other hand, if

depreciation (stock price declines) occurs in only one country, and not in other countries, that
means that this country had an idiosyncratic shock that has trade competitiveness implications. The
market may take some time to digest the information, and investors will likely respond to change
the exchange rate or the stock prices on the following day.

Therefore, whether the exchange rate

changes (or the stock price changes) are region-wide or idiosyncratic has difference implications

12/37

for today’s exchange rate (or the stock price). We will model this inference by choosing the relative
exchange rate change on the right-hand side, while the currency (or the stock price) of one country
is the left-hand-side variable.

Second, the large depreciations (or sharp declines in the stock

prices) have non-linear effects on the exchange rate and stock prices of other countries as well as
the country of origin.

The identification of origin country is made by the largest declines, and the

non-linearity is taken into account by selecting only declines beyond some threshold. Beyond the
first part of exchange rate (stock price) process, the large shocks have cross-border implications.
The shocks of the different origin countries may have different effects.

The large changes in the

exchange rates (or the stock prices) of different countries are separately used as the right-hand-side
variables.

We will be interested in examining the effects of contagion, namely cross-border effects of
(infrequent) large changes in the exchange rates or stock prices on those of other countries. The
impact of relative changes in the exchange rate (or stock prices) on today’s exchange rate (or stock
prices) is used to control for small (every day) changes.

The regression model we employ in this section is the Tobit model. The general formulation of the
model is given as follows:

y*=x’b+e
y = y*

if

y* > a1,

=0

if

y*≤ a1,

where a1 is the threshold.

The probability that y=0 is calculated as

13/37

Pr ob( y = 0)
= Pr ob( y* ≤ 0)
= Pr ob( x' b + e ≤ 0)
= Pr ob(e ≤ − x' b)
= Φ (− x' b / σ ).
Then, the likelihood that y=y* can be rewritten as

f ( y = y* | y* > a1)
= Pr ob( y* > a1)
= f ( y = y*)
= ϕ[(

y − x' b

σ

)]

1
σ.

The log likelihood for this Tobit regression model is

ln L =

∑

i∈( yi =0 )

ln Φ[

− x' b

σ

∑

]+

i∈( yi = y *)

{ln Φ[(

y − x' b

σ

)] − ln σ }.

where x= [FXKAIRI, SPKAIRI, FXORIGIN, SPORIGIN]’. In the model, the “FXKAIRI” and
“SPKAIRI” variables are used to control for small changes in those variables. They compare the
differences of exchange rate (stock price) trend between the home and other Asian countries. That
is, FXKAIRI and SPKAIRI are 8 by 1 vectors (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia,
Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand). FXORIGIN and SPORIGIN are dummy variables
indicating whether the depreciation (stock price fall) is affected by the hard-hit country.
FXORIGIN is a 6 by 1 vector because the (five-day averaged) exchange rates of Hong Kong and
Singapore did not show depreciations over 2% and therefore these two countries were excluded
from “origin”, and SPORIGIN is a 8 by 1 vector.

The expected sign of parameters is as follows:
In SP equation

14/37

(i) SPKAIRI (stock price difference between the home and other Asian countries)
The parameter is expected to be positive if the stock prices exhibit an autoregressive tendency (that
is, loss of confidence in the stock market carries over to the next day).
(ii) FXKAIRI (exchange rate difference between the home and other Asian countries)
The parameter is expected to be negative if relative depreciation in one day results in the stock
price declines in the following day (that is, the depreciation does not result in trade competitiveness
but loss of confidence in the country; or depreciation triggers the monetary tightening that affects
adversely the stock market.)
(iii) FXORIGIN and SPORIGIN
the FXORIGIN and SPORIGIN are dummy variables taking either 1 or 0. Thus the parameter is
expected to be positive when the large change is contagious, that is, the stock prices are adversely
affected by the large declines in the value of currency or the stock prices at an origin country of
previous day.

In FX equation
(i) SPKAIRI
The parameter is expected to be negative if the stock price declines result in depreciation in the
following day (that is, the decline in stock prices come from loss of confidence in the country,
rather than the common interest rate shock.)
(ii) FXKAIRI
The parameter is expected to be positive if depreciation in day t-1 results in depreciation in day t
(that is, the loss of confidence in the exchange rate tends to show the autoregressive nature).
(iii) FXORIGIN and SPORIGIN
the FXORIGIN and SPORIGIN are dummy variables taking either 1 or 0. Thus the parameter is
expected to be positive when the large change is contagious, that is, the exchange rates are
adversely affected by the large declines in the value of currency or the stock prices at an origin

15/37

country of previous day.

4. Results
There are several channels and factors that transmit a shock in exchange rates to stock prices and
vise versa. Before findings are reported in details, several channels of high-frequency contagion
among the exchange rates and stock prices are reviewed.

The first channel is the spillover effect from the exchange rate shock to stock prices. There are two
competing effects through this channel. If the exchange rate depreciation is orderly and moderate,
the depreciation boosts its trade competitiveness at least temporarily, in the presence of nominal
domestic price rigidities and is expected to have a positive effect on the stock prices. This is the
case of the Indonesian and Korean stock prices at the early stage of Asian currency crisis, where
the exchange rates of these two countries were relatively stable and the stock prices were rather
rising. On the other hand, a sharp and rapid depreciation will induce a fall in stock prices, due to
the change in sentiment (confidence) of market participants and the monetary policy reaction to
depreciation.

Depreciation will increase in probability of corporate failures for those with foreign

currency denominated liabilities. Moreover, depreciation likely prompts the central bank to raise
the interest rate to defend the currency from falling sharply.6 But, the higher interest rate will cause
a decline in stock prices.

Although the signs of spillover effects from the exchange rate to stock

prices cannot be theoretically determined, the sharp depreciation, as opposed to moderate, orderly
depreciation, tends to cause the stock prices to decline.

The second channel is the one from the stock prices to the exchange rate. From the perspective that
6

In October 1997, Hong Kong dollar was targeted by speculative attacks and the Currency Board
system raised interest rate that resulted in a decline in stock prices. In order to avoid the financial
market turmoil due to the stock price fall, several measures, a buying up stocks with public funds,
to shore up the stock market were taken in the speculative attack in August 1998. Countries with
fixed exchange rate regime, for example, People's Republic of China and Malaysia (from
September 1998), experienced a rise in interest rate under a pressure of devaluation.
16/37

the stock price reflects economic fundamentals, the news announcement of weak fundamentals
causes economic growth slowdown, a smaller profit opportunity, and further, the currency
depreciation. A fall in stock price may result in depreciation.

The third channel is contagion among the currencies. This was the topic of Ito and Hashimoto
(2002), and other papers on the contagion of currency crisis.

The final transmission channel is cross-border contagion among different stock markets. From the
market interdependence perspective, such as macroeconomic similarities and trade linkage, a fall in
stock price contagiously spillovers to other countries. Regardless of macroeconomic fundamentals
and other financial markets, a negative shock in one country spreads to another through real and
financial linkages. There is a large literature on the co-movements of stock prices among
industrialized countries.

For example, a country with declining stock prices most likely

experiences an economic slowdown, and that would reduce the import, negatively affecting the
exporting countries in the medium run: even if it takes several months for this process to work
through the export-import linkage, the impact of stock price declines, especially large ones, is
immediate.

Investors tend to downgrade their assessment of neighboring countries with trade

linkage when a large stock price decline occurs in one country. Indeed, a change in sentiment of
and risk assessment of an entire region serves as a transmission channel of stock price declines.

Table 2 shows the estimated threshold for both exchange rates and stock prices. It is found from our
estimation that the change in exchange rate (stock price) exceeding 1% can be regarded as
“significantly” different from the noise over the sample period. In the Tobit estimation below, we
set the threshold at 1%.

Table2 inserted here

17/37

The Tobit estimates are reported in Tables 3-1 to 3-6. We run regressions for three sample periods:
entire sample (July 1, 1997-July 7, 1999), first-half (July 1, 1997-June 18, 1998), and second-half
(June 19, 1998-July 7, 1999) periods.

The dependent variable takes 1 if the fluctuations of exchange rates (stock prices) exceed 1% and 0
otherwise. A Tobit regression is estimated for all countries for the cases with the stock prices as a
dependent variable. However, in the case where dependent variable is a change in exchange rates,
Tobit estimates for Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand are reported for the full
sample period and the first-half sample period, and Indonesia for the second-half sample period.
This is due to the fact the rate of change in exchange rates above 1% are hardly observed after mid
1998, consistent with what we found in Table 1-1.

Most of the Asian countries put the crisis

behind by mid-1998 and the risk of further exchange rate instability was decreased by then.

Table3-1－3-3 inserted here

The estimates of the parameters on the exchange rate are shown in Table 3-1-Table 3-3. Table3-1
reports results of the entire sample period, Table 3-2 reports the first-half, and Table 3-3 reports the
latter-half. The effect on the SPKAIRI coefficients is significant in 2 countries (out of 5) during the
first-half period, and 1(out of 1) for the latter-half period. As expected, the decline in stock prices
in Malaysia had an effect to further deteriorate the stock prices in the midst of crisis; in Indonesia,
the decreasing in stock prices exacerbated falling stock prices in a weakening market even after the
mid 1998. The effect on the FXKAIRI coefficients is significant in 5 (out of 5) countries against 0
(out of 1) for the first- and the latter-half period, respectively. The coefficient estimates are all
positive, indicating that the decline in exchange rate accelerate its depreciation.

18/37

The effect on the ORIGIN coefficient estimates is relatively minor, except Hong Kong stock prices,
but the most of parameters on the SPORIGIN estimates on the Thailand exchange rate are
significant and positive. Given the devaluation of Thailand, the turndown of the stock market in the
region weakened the exchange rate of Thailand. With this exception, it is found that the contagious
impact on exchange rates was relatively small from the stock price origin countries.

In contrast to the stock price origin, the impact of exchange rate origin is remarkable. The effect on
the exchange rate origin of Indonesia and Korea coefficients appears to be significant in most
countries.

In summary, the Asian exchange rates during the crisis were found particularly vulnerable to Hong
Kong stock prices, Indonesia and Korea exchange rates.

Table3-4－3-6

The estimation results of contagious impact on stock prices are shown in Table 3-4 to Table 3-6.
Table3-4 reports results of the entire sample period, Table 3-5 reports the first-half, and Table 3-6
reports the latter-half.

The effect on the SPKAIRI coefficients is significant in 6 countries (out of 8) during the first-half
period, and 7(8) for the latter-half period. The parameter sign is as expected, indicating that the
decreasing stock prices leads to a further decline. The effect of the FXKAIRI coefficients is
significant in 5(8) countries in both the first- and latter-half period.

The impact of SPORIGIN on stock prices is time-varying. During the first-half period, Hong Kong,
Korea, Malaysia and Philippines are the four major stock price origin countries, while the

19/37

Indonesia, Singapore and Taiwan became the major origin countries after mid 1998. These are
consistent with the fact that Hong Kong stock market was targeted as speculative attack in October
1997 and Korean stock price index declined sharply in late 1997, while stock prices in Indonesia
remained unstable even after 1998 due to its economic and political instability.

The estimation results of the exchange rate origin shows that Indonesia, Korea and Thailand are
found to be the three main origin countries on stock prices of other countries during the crisis. The
effect of the exchange rate origin on stock prices dramatically reduced for the latter-half sample
period, reflecting the return of stability to the foreign exchange markets in the region.

In summary, our estimation results clearly show the evidence of contagion between an exchange
rate and a stock price of the same country or of different countries during the crisis period. It is also
shown that the contagious impact on exchange rates was mainly due to the Hong Kong stock price
fall and Indonesia and Korean depreciations. In contrast to the impact on exchange rates, the stock
prices are found to be more under influences of exchange rates and stock prices of other countries.

Table4-1, 4-2

Tables 4-1 and 4-2 summarize the estimation results. They provide the parameter signs and the
significance level, with shaded areas are those with significance with correct signs.

Focusing on

the crisis period, the impact of exchange rates on exchange rates of other countries is as much as
that on stock prices of other countries. In particular, Indonesian and Korean exchange rate
fluctuations exercised considerable influence over the foreign exchange markets and stock markets
in Asia. In contrast, the contagious effect of stock price on other countries’ stock prices seems
relatively minor, compared to the stock price effect on exchange rates. As shown in the tables
above, the contagious impact on stock prices and on exchange rates from other countries are

20/37

asymmetric; we find contagion among exchange rates and from stock prices to exchange rates, but
relatively small (minor) evidence of contagion among stock prices.

It is obvious from Table4-1 that the exchange rate of Thailand was affected by the stock price
movements—not only by the domestic stock prices but by other Asian stock price behaviors. One
might conjecture a process of the collapse of exchange rates in Thailand; the gradual deterioration
of fundamentals led the stock price fall and finally triggered the currency crisis of July 1997. In
addition, the battered stock markets in Asia accelerated the continuing fall of exchange rates after
August 1997.

By examining the stock price reactions, we got a new insight in the crisis contagion. From our
estimation, the Hong Kong stock price was found to be affected by the Indonesian, Korean and
Thai currency depreciation during the crisis. The Hong Kong was said to have survived the
contagious effects during the crisis in terms of the exchange rate regime, but our finding was that
the Hong Kong also suffered the crisis in terms of contagion from currencies to stock prices.

Surprisingly, stock prices of Asia had little contagious effect on Korean exchange rate. Only Hong
Kong stock prices are significantly estimated to affect the Korean exchange rate. The Korean stock
prices are found to suffer no contagious effect from stock prices and exchange rates of other Asian
countries. Although, we need a more careful examination of Korean financial markets, but our
estimation results support the common perception that the Korean crisis in 1997 was the
simultaneous occurrence of twin (currency and banking) crises and it is not the fundamentals-led
crisis.

5. Concluding remarks
In this paper we analyze the co-movement of the exchange rates and the stock prices from the

21/37

viewpoint of contagion among the eight countries in the region during the period of Asian currency
crisis, 1997-1999. By examining the stock price reactions and exchange rate movements, a new
insight with regard to the crisis contagion is obtained. In this paper we do not use the orthodox
analytical method, VAR, to examine the contagion in financial markets. Instead, we use a friction
model and a Tobit model to analyze the impact of a negative shock in one asset price to others. In
estimation, we take into account the difference between mildly-affected countries and
severely-affected countries, large declines in the exchange rates (or stock prices) and others, and
the asset price trend in each country.

Our results show the evidence of contagion between an exchange rate and a stock price for selected
pairs of countries during the crisis period. It is also shown that the contagious impact on exchange
rates was mainly due to the Hong Kong stock price fall and Indonesia and Korean depreciations. In
contrast to the impact on exchange rates, the stock prices are found to be more under influences of
exchange rates and stock prices of other countries.

Major findings of this paper are as follows.

First, the Indonesian, Korean and Thai exchange rates

had large impacts on the stock prices of other countries, while other currencies did not have
impacts on stock prices of other countries. Second, the Hong Kong stock market was significantly
affected by the Indonesian, Korean, and Thai depreciation. Therefore, the contagion effect of Asian
crisis can be said to have a great impact even in Hong Kong. Third, the Indonesian and Korean, but
not Thai, exchange rates had impacts on other currencies in the region. This may be contrary to
casual observation that the currency crisis spread from Thailand to other countries in the second
half of 1997.

Fourth, contagion among stock markets was not significant for most pairs of the

countries. Fifth, Hong Kong stock price was found to have substantial effects on Asian exchange
rates in the midst of crisis. Sixth, Thai exchange rates were quite sensitive to shocks in stock prices
of other countries.

Seventh, other than Hong Kong stock price effects on other currencies, and

22/37

any stock price shocks on the Thai currencies, the spillovers from the stock price shocks to the
exchange rate were not significant.
