Unilateral Facilitation Does Not Raise International Labor Migration from the Philippines
Emily Beam, David McKenzie, and Dean Yang
NBER Working Paper No. 20759
December 2014
JEL No. C93,F22,O15
ABSTRACT
Significant income gains from migrating from poorer to richer countries have motivated unilateral
(source-country) policies facilitating labor emigration. However, their effectiveness is unknown. We
conducted a large-scale randomized experiment in the Philippines testing the impact of unilaterally
facilitating international labor migration. Our most intensive treatment doubled the rate of job offers
but had no identifiable effect on international labor migration. Even the highest overseas job-search
rate we induced (22%) falls far short of the share initially expressing interest in migrating (34%). We
conclude that unilateral migration facilitation will at most induce a trickle, not a flood, of additional
emigration.

1. Introduction
Wage rates of workers using the same skills and doing the same jobs differ by as much as ten
to one depending on the country in which they work (Ashenfelter, 2012). Moving from a
developing to a developed country results in immediate large increases in income for the
migrants, with gains that far exceed those of any other development policy intervention
(Clemens, Montenegro, and Pritchett, 2009; Hanson, 2009; McKenzie, Gibson, and Stillman,
2010; Gibson and McKenzie, 2014). Why do so few people emigrate, and what policies can
governments in developing countries pursue to make it easier for their citizens to escape poverty
through international migration?
There is a growing literature in development economics that addresses the question of why
households do not make objectively profitable investments such as using more fertilizer (Duflo
et al., 2011), reinvesting profits in their businesses (Fafchamps et al., 2014), keeping enough
small change (Beaman et al., 2014), and continuing in school (Jensen, 2010). These studies have
shown that often a relatively small and inexpensive intervention, such as providing information
or nudging behavior, can result in more households undertaking these investments. But the
absolute scale of the returns to these investments is small – Duflo et al. (2011) estimate farmers
stand to earn $10 more per season from using fertilizer for example.1 In contrast Clemens et al.
(2009) estimate that a marginal moderate-skill mover from a typical developing country to the
United States would earn an additional $10,000 per year, a gain 1,000 times as large. Yet to date
there is very little literature to explain why more individuals do not take up these massive
returns, or on what interventions can work in spurring them to do so.
Migration-source country governments have pursued two broad approaches to facilitating
international migration for formal, legal work. Source countries can pursue unilateral facilitation
policies on their own, without needing the cooperation of governments of migration-destination
countries. Unilateral facilitation may involve provision of information, loan facilitation, and
policies to ease the international job-search process. These policies act on the supply side of the
migrant labor market and are similar in spirit to the types of interventions that have been shown
to enable households to undertake smaller-scale profitable investments. Enhanced unilateral
facilitation could have positive impacts on migration if immigration policies in destination

countries are sufficiently open, or if bilateral policies are already in place. Conversely, even
though migration can have a high return, investing in obtaining information, in acquiring a
passport, and in searching for overseas jobs may have low returns if border restrictions make the
probability of being able to migrate abroad after undertaking this investment low.
Bilateral facilitation policies, on the other hand, involve cooperation with governments or
employers in destination countries and include formalization of agreements to allow labor
migration of specified numbers and types of workers. Such policies primarily attempt to
influence the demand side of the migrant labor market, but they could also have supply-side
components.
The Philippines has made perhaps the greatest progress among migration-source countries in
implementing bilateral approaches, as evidenced by the existence of 49 bilateral migration
agreements with 25 destination countries (Center for Migrant Advocacy, 2012) and an annual
deployment of more than 2.0 million overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) worldwide (CFO, 2012).
Consequently, overseas remittances top US$25 billion annually, nearly 10% of GDP (BSP
2012). However, the Philippines is not alone in promoting international migration; countries such
as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India are looking to the Philippine government’s efforts as a
model for promoting and regulating international migration (Ray et al., 2007).2
A wider range of countries have also attempted unilateral policies to ease the barriers
preventing their citizens from migrating. For example, several Pacific Island governments such
as Tuvalu have provided financing for seasonal workers wishing to migrate abroad (Bedford et
al., 2010). A number of countries have made it easier for their citizens to obtain passports; Nepal,
for example, decentralized the passport issuance process so that citizens no longer had to travel
over mountain ranges to Kathmandu to obtain a passport (McKenzie, 2007). Other countries,
such as Armenia, have attempted to provide potential migrants with more information about the
disadvantages of illegal migration and about possibilities for legal jobs abroad (IOM, 2009). And
Egypt created a jobs website better connect Egyptian jobseekers and employers abroad
(Fandrich, 2009).

	  While the Philippines ranks fourth globally in total remittances received annually, just behind Mexico, as a share of
its own GDP, it ranks only 18th, behind countries including Nepal, Honduras, El Salvador, Serbia, and Bangladesh
(Ratha, Mohapatra, and Silwal, 2010).

Despite the spread of these policies, there is currently little rigorous empirical evidence on
the effectiveness of either unilateral or bilateral migration facilitation in enabling individuals to
benefit from the large income gains international migration offers. We implement a randomized
experiment measuring the impact of unilateral migration facilitation. Our experiment is large in
scale, implements unilateral facilitation at a range of intensities, and occurs in the Philippines,
one of the world’s most important sources of legal, temporary, international labor migration.
We implement our study in Sorsogon, a province that sends relatively few labor migrants
overseas compared to other parts of the Philippines, but where one-third of households say they
would like to migrate abroad. These features – existing and extensive bilateral labor migration
arrangements, but relatively low migration relative to other parts of the country – make our
experimental context one where unilateral migration policies could potentially have a substantial
positive impact. While Sorsogon residents are underrepresented among OFWs, a good share is
likely to be qualified for overseas work: more than two-thirds (69%) of our sample had
completed high school, and nearly half (50%) had completed at least some post-secondary
school.3 We deliberately focus on a random sample of households, rather than selecting on initial
interest in migration, in order to use our interventions to help assess the role of different
explanations why most households don’t migrate.
Our experiment tested the impact of unilateral facilitation policies modeled after potential
low and medium-cost interventions to reduce informational, job-matching, and documentation
barriers, which, as described above, have been used at least in part by a wide range of other
countries. In addition to its active role in bilateral migration facilitation, the Philippines
government has undertaken or has underway a number of unilateral efforts, such as warning
migrants about illegal recruitment, providing information on cultural differences in different
destinations abroad, and implementing new efforts to reduce the hassle of applying for a passport
(Reyes, 2012).
The treatments we implement build on these policy efforts, but we refine them to isolate
specific mechanisms that may prevent most people from migrating abroad. We target the

	  The recruitment agencies we worked with were eager to attract workers from Sorsogon Province, particularly for
jobs that require less-specialized work experience, for which they reported difficulty in filling vacancies. They were
hesitant to recruit in rural areas because although they had no difficulty identifying qualified workers, in the past
they found that applicants would initiate but could not complete the process.

following mechanisms: 1) information (about job search, migrating abroad, financing migration,
and passport processing); 2) frictions in job search (assistance in enrolling in an online jobfinding website set up by the project to lower search costs and facilitate matching between
recruiters and workers); and 3) documentation barriers (assistance and a full subsidy for passport
application). We randomized adults of prime migration age into various combinations of
treatments facilitating international labor migration. Individuals were randomized into a control
group that received no treatment or into treatment groups receiving one or more of the set of
facilitation treatments.
Although we find that our package of interventions results in individuals taking more steps
towards international migration, such as searching for work abroad, getting a job interview, and
even getting a job offer, we find a precise zero impact of even our full package of assistance on
the likelihood of international migration over a two-year period. Our point estimate is exactly
zero, and the 95-percent confidence interval is [-1.4%, +1.4%]. Thus reducing information,
search, and documentation frictions through the methods tested here can explain at most why 1
in 100 don’t migrate, and cannot explain why most people don’t migrate abroad. This contrasts
strongly with work on facilitating internal migration in which information and job postings were
sufficient to get rural Thai migrants to go to nearby cities rather than Bangkok (Fuller et al.
1985), and a small subsidy equal to the cost of a bus ticket was sufficient to spur a large increase
in internal seasonal migration in Bangladesh (Bryan et al. 2014). The difference here is, of
course, that even with information, job-seeking assistance, and a passport, border restrictions are
still in place and restrict migration. We find some evidence of remaining barriers on both the
demand and supply sides for migrant labor that may explain this lack of migration.
2. Setting
The Philippines is a useful setting to study the impact of unilateral approaches. The
Philippine government’s extensive bilateral facilitation policies, along with strong international
labor demand, have created many migration opportunities in the past few decades. The
government directly encourages international emigration and regulates private labor recruiters.
Numerous financial institutions provide financial services to help potential migrants pay
recruitment fees (O’Neil, 2004). In the Philippines, even with this infrastructure in place, and
despite the fact that the country’s per capita GDP (around US$2,000) is less than one tenth of

4	  

that in developed countries, most Filipinos do not migrate, and five in six families do not receive
remittances from workers abroad.
While the Philippines stands out as a promoter of international migration, it is far from alone
in doing so. The promise of remittances and their potential to spur economic development has
similarly motivated developed and developing country governments to encourage workers
overseas either directly, through bilateral arrangements, or indirectly, by providing favorable tax
treatment and incentives to encourage remittances (Puri and Ritzema, 1999; World Bank, 2006).
The type of temporary migration common in the Philippines – legal migration of an individual as
a temporary worker – is common worldwide, with almost all OECD countries having temporary
worker programs; it is also the dominant form of labor migration into the Gulf countries, and to
Singapore, Malaysia and Japan.
We conducted our experiment in Sorsogon, a rural province 10-12 hours by bus from the
capital, Manila, where most recruitment activities take place. Reflecting its relative poverty and
isolation, the Bicol region (where Sorsogon is located) has relatively low participation in
international migration. The region accounts for 5.8% of the Philippine population, but only
3.3% of the country’s overseas worker deployments in 2011 (NSO, 2011).
We deliberately chose to focus on a random sample of households from this province, as
detailed below. This enables us to examine what we consider to be the most important question,
“why do most people not migrate?” An alternative approach would be to try to screen a
population to obtain a group of individuals who are right at the margin of migrating, and see
whether particular interventions are enough to push them over the threshold of migrating.
Although we believe this would also be an interesting avenue to explore in future experiments, it
would answer a much narrower question. But recent findings as to why individuals do not take
high-return investments have stressed that it may be because individuals do not have the right
information, or need a ”nudge” to overcome behavioral biases (Jensen, 2010; Duflo et al., 2011).
This suggests that focusing just on individuals who have already signaled their intent to migrate
or who have taken steps towards doing so may miss out on individuals who could benefit
substantially from information and other assistance.
3. Methods

5	  

Early in 2010, we randomly selected 42 barangays from 6 municipalities in Sorsogon
Province in which to conduct the baseline survey.4 We collected a household roster from each
barangay that included a list of households, and we used these to set barangay-specific target
sample sizes proportional to population. We targeted approximately 5% of the total population
from each barangay, or roughly 26% of households. We sorted households randomly and
selected the first listed households to be our target. When a household could not be located or
had no eligible members, we replaced it with the next household on the list.
From each household, interviewers screened the first member they met who had never
worked abroad and was aged 20-45. Subsequent to the baseline survey, we learned from
recruitment agencies that most individuals over age 40 would not be eligible for overseas work,
so we restrict our baseline sample to the 4,153 individuals ages 20-40 we interviewed.5 Houses
selected were typically far enough apart from each other that concerns about information
spillovers are second order; to the extent that there were spillovers, our treatment estimates are
lower bounds on the differential impact of more information. The passport assistance was only
offered to the respondents themselves, and so it is not subject to such spillovers. Appendix A.1
describes our project timeline and sampling procedure in greater detail.
Table 1 reports demographic characteristics of the sample from the baseline survey. 71% of
respondents are female, reflecting the fact that women were more likely to be at home when our
project staff visited the household, but also enabling us to target those most likely to benefit from
a reduction in barriers to overseas migration. Unlike some other migrant-sending countries such
as Mexico, India, and Bangladesh, where the majority of migrants are male,6 migration from the
Philippines is female-dominated; between 1992-2009, 61% of new hires for overseas work were
women (McKenzie, Theoharides, and Yang, 2014). Respondents report relatively high
educational attainment (69% have completed high school and 36% have completed at least some
post-secondary schooling) but low levels of household income (averaging P7,400 pesos/month,

A barangay is the smallest administrative division in the Philippines. The municipalities we selected each have
between 25 and 65 barangays, and there are a total of roughly 42,000 barangays in the country.

For the passport sample, we also required that individuals be between ages 20-40. Tables A12 and A13
demonstrate that our results are not affected by including the 855 respondents ages 41-45 who participated in the
baseline survey.

	  Based on authors’ calculations from 2000 data from the Global Bilateral Migration Database (World Bank Group
2011, Özden et al., 2011). Overall, the global stock of migrants is predominantly male. However, as of 2000, the
estimated stock of migrants from the Philippines was 61.1% female, while the stock was 44.7% female from
Mexico, 42.4% female from Bangladesh, and 39.0% female from India.

or US$165) suggesting they may have high returns to working overseas.7 34% report that they
are “interested” or “strongly interested” in working abroad.
We revisited respondents in 2012 to collect information on their overseas job-search
knowledge, job-search behavior, and migration decisions. We ask whether and how respondents
searched for work overseas between 2010-2012, and we classify respondents as having migrated
if they obtained a job offer and migrated abroad during that period.8 We successfully surveyed
90.8% of respondents or another member of their household at endline, and we find no evidence
of differential attrition across treatment assignment (Table A2).9 Our primary analytical sample
consists of these 90.8% for whom we successfully fielded an endline survey of the respondent or
a fellow household member. Among the 9.2% who could not be reached at endline in this
manner, we fielded brief “log” surveys of neighbors on international labor migration by the
respondent, and inclusion of these log surveys raises our total endline response rate (for the
“migrate abroad” outcome) to 98.5%. We show in section A.5 that our estimated impacts on
migration are robust to use of the full (98.5%) endline sample, which includes the log surveys.
3.1 Theoretical Reasons Why More People Don’t Migrate
In the classic economic migration model, migration is an investment: individuals and
households incur moving costs to generate returns via higher incomes (Sjaastad, 1962).
Subsequent work acknowledges imperfect financial markets in developing countries can also
create additional rationales for migrating such as to finance household investments (Stark and
Bloom, 1985; Yang, 2006).
This framework suggests three main reasons why individuals do not migrate even when there
are job opportunities and higher incomes to be earned abroad. First, individuals may have high
disutility from moving and therefore may not wish to migrate internationally even though the
monetary benefits outweigh the monetary costs. This is certainly not what many non-migrants
say. For example, 51.1% of surveyed Filipinos aged 15 and older say they would like to work
abroad if they had the opportunity (Gallup World Poll, 2010). Second, individuals may not be
fully informed about the costs and benefits of migration. Perhaps because they do not get to

observe the outcomes of the most successful individuals who leave (Wilson, 1987, Jensen 2010),
potential migrants may underestimate the benefits of migration (McKenzie, Gibson, and
Stillman, 2013). Third, individuals may wish to migrate but may be unable to do so because of
various constraints such as credit market imperfections (McKenzie and Rapoport, 2007; Grogger
and Hanson, 2011); documentation barriers such as difficulty in obtaining a passport (McKenzie,
2007); or frictions in job search that are exacerbated when searching internationally (Ortega,
2000; Lumpe and Weigert, 2009). We designed interventions to attempt to reduce these barriers.
However, we should note that the original Sjaastad (1962) model was written with internal
migration in mind. In this model, any individual who pays the costs of migrating can do so if
they choose. In contrast, international migration presents the further constraint of international
borders, which limit migration opportunities. There are two ways we can modify the model to
include the presence of these borders. The first is to view border restrictions as another element
of the cost of migrating (e.g. paying for the qualifications to meet skilled migration requirements
or paying recruitment fees to companies that can secure a job opening for you abroad). If these
costs are large relative to the costs of information, job search frictions, and documentation, then
interventions that change only these components of costs without relaxing border restrictions will
have limited effect. Alternatively, instead of viewing the model as being about whether to invest
in migration, it could be viewed as being about whether to invest in steps to migration, such as
obtaining information about migration, searching for a job abroad, and getting a passport. The
expected returns from investing in this technology will then depend on how easy it is to migrate
once these other constraints are overcome – if border restrictions make the likelihood of
migrating low, it may not be profitable to invest in efforts to migrate, even though migration
itself is extremely profitable for those who get to migrate.
3.2 Interventions
Information and website assistance
During the baseline survey, we randomly assigned respondents to a control group or to one of
four treatment groups designed to improve their information about and access to overseas work
opportunities (Figure 1). These groups were application information [T1], financial information
[T2], application and financial information [T1] + [T2], and website assistance [T4]. The
application information consisted of information on typical overseas costs; the steps needed to

8	  

apply for work abroad; an advertisement to enroll in Pilijobs.org, an overseas job-finding website
designed as part of this project;10 and a list of ways to avoid illegal recruitment from the
Philippine Overseas Employment Agency. Financial information consisted of typical placement
fees for work abroad and a list of Manila-based financial companies that provide loans for
placement fees.
To facilitate job-matching, we worked with several Manila-based overseas recruitment
agencies and a Sorsogon microfinance NGO to develop a website, Pilijobs.org, to help
respondents easily contact and apply with reputable recruitment agencies and to allow those
agencies to directly post job opportunities that could be accessed by respondents. While several
widely used job-finding websites for overseas work already exist in the Philippines, we
developed a separate one to ensure that applicants would be put in contact only with highquality, properly licensed recruitment agencies and to track their enrollment and participation in
the website. Five recruitment agencies used the site, both to post job listings and to review
applicants, and we worked closely with them to obtain their feedback and to encourage their staff
to use the website. Section A.2 includes additional details about Pilijobs.org
Website assistance [T4] was always assigned along with application and financial
information ([T1] + [T2]). It consisted of a paper form respondents could use to enroll in
Pilijobs.org, and interviewers provided help if requested. Interviewers returned to pick up
completed forms, or respondents returned them to a nearby office. Project staff encoded and
uploaded forms to the website.
Passport assistance
Based on feedback from our partner recruitment agencies during the first stage of the project,
we determined that another potential barrier to overseas migration was difficulty accessing a
passport. Agencies reported that because of difficulty and delays many individuals encounter
when applying for passports, they prioritized applicants who already had passports. In mid-2011,
we randomly assigned a subset of our sample to one of two treatments targeted to help
respondents get passports for overseas work, which were cross-randomized with our initial
treatments to generate 15 total treatment and control cells (Figure 1).

since it was taken down when our project ended.

The first passport treatment, passport information [T3], provided respondents a flier on the
importance of having a passport before applying for overseas work and the steps they could take
to obtain a passport. The second passport treatment, passport assistance [T3]+[T5], involved the
passport information treatment, plus a letter inviting respondents to participate in a program that
fully subsidized the typical costs of applying for a passport (including transportation), along with
project staff assistance with passport application.
Figure 1 shows the treatments, which range from the control group to “All information”
(application, financial, and passport information [T1] + [T2] + [T3]) and “All information +
website” ([T1] + [T2] + [T3] + [T4]). The most intensive treatment, “Full assistance,” includes
all information treatments, website assistance, and passport assistance ([T1] + [T2] + [T3] + [T4]
+ [T5]).
3.3 Randomization to treatment and control
Information and website assistance randomization
Our baseline sample was randomly allocated to a control group or to one of four treatment
groups: application information [T1], financial information [T2], application and financial
information ([T1] + [T2]), and website assistance ([T1] + [T2] + [T4]). The sample was divided
evenly between these five groups.
Each respondent’s treatment assignment was blind to the interviewer until after he or she
completed the baseline survey. Interviewers received sealed envelopes containing a thank-you
letter, the information treatments (as assigned), and blank paper to balance the weight of the
envelopes between treatment types so that the interviewer could not guess the treatment until the
envelope was opened after the survey. Each envelope was labeled with the household
identification number assigned to the respondent being interviewed, serving as the link between
the respondent and treatment assignment.
Because of our partnership with the microfinance institution PALFSI, we anticipated that
current clients might respond differently to treatment and have different characteristics from nonPALFSI clients. Envelopes were randomized by barangay and by microfinance client status in
blocks of five. This procedure generated block randomization within 81 barangay-by-client-

10	  

status stratification cells. Our regression estimates include indicator variables for each
stratification cell as control variables.
Passport randomization
Respondents in the passport survey were randomly assigned with equal probability to a
control group or to one of two treatment groups prior to implementation. We stratified members
of the passport sample by baseline treatment group, whether they had enrolled in Pilijobs.org,
barangay, and age. Specifically, we divided members of this sample into groups based on
baseline treatment assignment and Pilijobs.org enrollment status, divided each group into
barangays, sorted by age within each barangay-sample cell, and block-randomized by threes.
These respondents were resurveyed and randomly assigned to a passport control group or to the
passport information [T3] or passport assistance ([T3] + [T5]) interventions.
Our administrative records indicate that 9.6% of baseline respondents offered passport
assistance successfully obtained a passport. Although the program provided a full subsidy of the
cost of the passport and required documentation, as well as fully subsidized transport expenses,
passport applicants still needed to devote substantial time and effort to obtain a passport. For
example, each applicant traveled one to two hours to the regional office of the Department of
Foreign Affairs in Legazpi City three separate times to apply for and receive their passport, and
most applicants made additional trips to other local agencies to obtain required documentation
for their passport application. The appendix (A.3 and Table A4) provides additional details on
the passport assistance program and direct impacts of the interventions on passport acquisition.

Balancing tests
Columns 1 through 5 of Table A3 report mean values for a set of individual and household
characteristics of respondents, separately for each of the four original treatment conditions plus
the control group. In columns 6 through 8 of the table, we report the corresponding
characteristics of respondents who were part of the passport sample, based on their assignment to
the passport control, information, or assistance treatments. (Recall that these are overlapping
treatments, but not all baseline respondents were part of the passport sample.)

11	  

The various randomized treatments have similar observables to the respective control groups.
While there are some cases where the mean value of a covariate in a treatment group is
statistically significantly different from the mean value in the respective control group (indicated
by one, two, or three stars for significance levels of 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively), their
frequency is commensurate with what we expect would occur by chance: out of 84 comparisons
with the control group mean in the table, nine (10.7%) are statistically significant at the 10%
level or less. Our regression estimates will control for this set of baseline covariates, which
should account for any biases due to these chance imbalances.
3.4 Specifications
We use the following specification to measure the impact of unilateral facilitation on jobsearch and migration:
𝑌! = 𝛼 +

!
!"
!!! 𝛽! 𝐷!

+ 𝐵! 𝜆 + 𝑋 ! 𝛿 + 𝜀! ,
!

where Yi is the outcome variable for respondent i, measured in the 2012 endline survey. 𝐷! is
a binary indicator equal to one if respondent i is assigned to combination j of application
information [T1], financial information [T2], passport information [T3], website assistance [T4],
or passport assistance [T5].
Vector B includes the barangay/client-status set of stratification cell fixed effects, along with
an indicator for whether the respondent was randomly selected to be in the passport sample. The
coefficient on this indicator would be non-zero if simply being interviewed in the passport
sample affected our endline outcomes. (In practice, this coefficient is consistently close to zero
and not statistically significant.) To increase the precision of our estimates, we also include a
vector of pre-specified controls, X, for the following baseline characteristics: female (indicator);
age (continuous); high school completion (indicator); some college or vocational training
(indicator); college completion (indicator); interested in working abroad (indicator); willingness
to take risks (0-10 scale); household income (in thousands of pesos); household savings (in
thousands of pesos); whether the household has ever taken out a loan (indicator); asset ownership
(normalized index of durable asset holdings); whether the respondent has extended family
overseas (indicator); and whether the respondent has immediate family overseas (indicator).

12	  

Missing covariate values are coded as zeros, and we include a set of missing value indicator
variables.
We have 14 mutually exclusive treatment categories in addition to an omitted control group,
as outlined in Figure 1. In regressions for main text Tables 2 and 3, we estimate all coefficients,
but to simplify presentation we report results for only the following five treatments:
1. Application, financial, and passport information [T1] + [T2] + [T3] (“All
information”)
2. Application information, financial information, passport information, and website
assistance [T1] + [T2] + [T3] + [T4] (“All information + website”)
3. Passport information and passport assistance (“Only Passport Assistance”) [T3]
+ [T5]
4. Application information, financial information, passport information, and passport
assistance [T1] + [T2] + [T3] + [T5] (“All information + passport”)
5. Application information, financial information, passport information, and website
assistance, and passport assistance [T1] + [T2] + [T3] + [T4] + [T5] (“Full Assistance”)
This specification enables us to report results for the full information treatment, and then for
combinations of the website assistance and passport assistance with full information. We report
the complete set of 14 treatment coefficients in Tables A10 and A11.
4. Results
We examine whether unilateral facilitation can increase international migration. In particular,
we test four hypotheses:
H1: The massive gain in income possible from migration should result in high migration
demand. Since the monetary gains from migration are likely to far exceed the monetary costs for
most Filipinos (Clemens, Montenegro, and Pritchett, 2009), theory predicts most individuals will
wish to migrate unless the disutility from moving is high. In fact only 33.9% of individuals say
they interested or very interested in migration at baseline, and far fewer search for work overseas
(5.1% of the control group) between survey rounds.
H2: Incomplete information prevents individuals from realizing the gains from migration. If
individuals underestimate the gains from migration (McKenzie, Gibson, and Stillman, 2013) or

13	  

overstate the costs, then some individuals for whom it is optimal to migrate will decide not to do
so. Knowledge is clearly incomplete – at baseline, one-quarter of individuals responded with
“don’t know” to the typical wages and costs of work overseas for six common destination
countries, and the responses given by those who do give an answer also suggest considerable
inaccuracies. For example, half of those who did respond estimated they would earn the same
wage or less in high-wage Canada as they would in low-wage Saudi Arabia. At endline, only
14.3% of the control group can name a lender who can finance migration costs and only 19.9%
know where to go to apply for a passport. However, the information treatments alone do not
result in higher rates of job search or international migration.
Figure 2 highlights means of key outcomes across a representative subset of treatments. We
see the rate of overseas job search (5.3%) for the “All information” treatment is similar in
magnitude, and not statistically different, from the 5.1% rate in the control group, and that only
1.1% of the “All information” group migrates abroad over the two-year period. Table 2 provides
regression estimates of the treatment effects for a broader range of job-search and migration
outcomes over the two-year period and confirms this lack of impact. Table 3 restricts the
regression analysis to the subset of individuals who indicated that they were interested in
migrating at baseline. In this subsample, information alone induces statistically significant
increases (at the 10% level) in the likelihood of being invited to interview and attending an
interview for work abroad, but there is no statistically significant impact of information alone on
actual migration.
H3: Frictions in matching with recruiters limit international migration. Even if individuals
have correct information and decide the gains from migration exceed the costs, they still need to
match with a job abroad (Ortega, 2000; Lumpe and Weigert, 2009). The website treatment is
intended to help individuals do this. Figure 2 shows that the combination of information and the
website treatment (“All Information + Website”) caused a substantial increase in the rate of
search for work abroad, from 5.1% to 15.7%. The regression-adjusted estimate of this treatment
effect from Table 2 is nearly identical, indicating a 10.6 percentage-point increase (statistically
significant at the 1% level). Despite inducing substantially higher search effort, the treatment
causes no additional migration abroad: the coefficient estimate in Table 2 column 8 is very small
in magnitude and is not significantly different from zero. For the subgroup expressing interest in
migrating at baseline, Table 3 shows the website and information combination resulted in a 19.6
14	  

percentage-point increase in job search and a 7.7 percentage-point increase in attending an
interview (statistically significant at the 1% and 5% levels, respectively), but much smaller and
statistically insignificant increases in the job offer rate (4.1 percentage points) and in the
migration rate (2.3 percentage points).
H4: Documentation barriers prevent individuals from taking advantage of job openings
abroad. Lack of a passport may prevent recruiters from even considering individuals for job
openings or prevent some of those who receive job offers from taking up these offers. Our most
intensive “Full assistance” treatment, which combines information, website assistance, and
assistance obtaining a passport, results in a 21.7% job-search rate (Figure 2), but it is still far
short of the 33.9% reporting interest in migration at baseline. Table 2 shows that this 15.9
percentage-point increase in job search over the control group rate is statistically significant at
the 1% level, and it mainly reflects increased online search (column 2, increase significant at the
1% level), in addition to some additional search via other methods, such as attending job fairs
(column 4, increase significant at the 5% level). The full assistance treatment also has positive
impacts on job-interview invitations, interview attendance, and job offer receipt (columns 5-7,
effects significant at the 10%, 5%, and 10% levels respectively), and these effects are large
relative to control group rates (2.6%, 1.5%, and 1.7%, respectively). Despite these positive
impacts on pre-migration outcomes, the treatment has no statistically significant impact on
migration abroad: the point estimate is zero percentage points to the third decimal place (column
8). A 95-percent confidence interval for the impact is [-1.4%, +1.4%].
Should we view these impacts as small or large? While this confidence interval includes
impacts that are large in relative terms compared to the control group migration rate of 0.9%,
they are very small in absolute terms. Even at the upper end of our confidence interval, at most
one out of one hundred individuals migrate as a result of the combined package of reduced
barriers. In the words of Clemens (2011), the massive gains from international migration
represent “trillion dollar bills on the sidewalk.” At present only 1 in 100 individuals in our
sample stops to pick up one of these bills, and at most, our full package of interventions succeeds
in getting 1 more picked up – clearly then our interventions do not explain why the vast majority
of people do not take up this opportunity. We are in agreement here with Rosenzweig (2012)
who critiques the practice of viewing large percentage changes on small bases as large effects,
when they represent very small absolute gains.
15	  

Table 3 shows these effects are larger for the sub-group initially expressing interest in
migration (for whom demand should not be the constraint), with a 26.6 percentage-point increase
in job search, a 8.5 percentage-point increase in job-interview attendance, and a 7.3 percentagepoint increase in the likelihood of receiving a job offer abroad (all statistically significant at the
5% level or less). However, there is still only a statistically insignificant 1.7 percentage-point
increase in migration abroad. That is, our full package of unilateral facilitation delivered to the
subgroup interested in migrating still does not significantly increase migration. Since this is a
subsample, the confidence interval is wider than for the full sample, but at [-1.7%, +5.1%], it still
covers only very modest absolute increases in migration rates.
The appendix (A.5, A.6, and Table A9) shows that these results are robust to a variety of
specifications and to alternate measures of migration outcomes, including a follow-up effort in
2013 to check the migration status of those with job offers who had not yet migrated in 2012. In
Tables A5 and A6, we examine the distribution of positions that individuals were offered as well
as the distribution of countries in which these jobs were located. The most common jobs offered
were for domestic helper (40.9%), service worker (8.6%), caregiver (7.5%), and factory worker
(7.5%), and nearly half were located in the Middle East. Table A7 shows the migration outcomes
by region, as of the 2012 survey: 31.2% of offers had led to migration.
In Table A8, we also examine the reasons some individuals with job offers did not migrate
overall and by region.11 We do not find evidence that the jobs offered were reported to be
undesirable overall, or that jobs in the Middle East are less likely to be found appealing. The
most common reasons given were financial and health related: 24.1% say they could not afford
migration costs, and 10.3% cite health issues or that they failed the medical exam. Additionally,
at least 27.9% of unaccepted offers can be attributed to a lack of demand to migrate, either
because of the conditions of the position (8.6% not interested in type of work, 6.9% salary too
low), family obligations (10.3%), or because the respondent was no longer interested in working
abroad (1.7%).

With a large sample of job offers, an alternative approach to exploring why not all people with job offers move
would be to examine the heterogeneity of moves with respect to different baseline characteristics such as access to
credit, skill level, health, and presence of young children. However, since we get so few moves overall, and the
sample with job offers is small, unsurprisingly we find no significant heterogeneity in treatment impacts on
migration.

16	  

The large gain in income possible through international migration makes it a puzzle that so
few individuals migrate abroad. We conduct a randomized impact evaluation of migration
facilitation policies designed to overcome information, matching, and documentation constraints
that may inhibit individuals from realizing these gains. These are policies that developing
countries can implement unilaterally, without needing to reach bilateral agreements with
migration destination countries.
Our results suggest that information constraints are not an important barrier to international
labor migration. Despite individuals lacking complete knowledge about the incomes they could
earn abroad, the costs of moving, or the process involved in migrating, we find that providing
such information has no overall impact on either job search or international migration.12
In contrast, we do find that assisting individuals to match with recruiters through a jobs
website and to overcome documentation barriers through passport assistance does increase in
job-search effort and the likelihood of obtaining a job interview. These constraints therefore
appear to inhibit individuals taking steps towards international migration, although even with our
maximum intensity facilitation, the rate of overseas job search over a two-year period, 21.7%, is
still far short of the fraction of individuals expressing interest in overseas migration at the start of
that period (33.9%). We conclude that survey-based elicitations of migration interest are likely to
exceed actual attempts at migration, even in response to intensive migration assistance.
However, these substantial impacts on job search lead to no large or statistically significant
increases in actual migration. Only a minority of the additional respondents induced to search for
jobs overseas in response to our most intensive facilitation treatment are invited to interview for
overseas jobs or receive overseas job offers. (That said, the effects of the treatment on these
outcomes are statistically significant and imply large proportional effects relative to low controlgroup rates of interviews and offers, but are still small in absolute magnitude) Substantial
fractions of those induced to search for overseas jobs by our treatments appear to be screened out
by those on the demand side of the migrant labor market – recruitment agencies and the ultimate
overseas employers. This is consistent with recent work showing how binding minimum wages
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
12

One potential reason for this is that more accurate information may dissuade overly optimistic individuals from
searching, balancing out an increase in search from individuals who undervalue the gains from migrating. Indeed we
find (and show in Table A7) that providing only financial information or passport information without other
facilitation has a small negative impact on job search, consistent with individuals understating the costs and
complexity of moving.

17	  

specific to occupation and destination limit the number of job openings abroad for Filipinos
(McKenzie, Theoharides, and Yang, 2014). It is also consistent with the main barrier preventing
international migration being a lack of opportunities to work abroad given visa restrictions. This
could also in turn help explain the limited responsiveness to even our most intense intervention –
individuals may conclude rationally that the return to looking for a job abroad even with a
passport and information is low—even if these jobs pay relatively high wages—because the
likelihood of getting such jobs is so low.
Perhaps the most surprising result of our study is that, while our most intensive facilitation
treatment delivers statistically significant increases in overseas job offers (that are large relative
to control group rates), it has zero impact on actual overseas migration (over a two-year posttreatment window). This lack of impact serves to further underline the point that demand for
international migration on the part of developing-country residents is likely to be overstated –
those induced by an intervention to receive actual job offers commonly reject those offers in the
end. Our survey evidence on the reasons these jobs are declined fails to pinpoint a dominant
reason behind such job-offer rejections. The most common reason, financial constraints (cited by
nearly a quarter of job-offer decliners), does not distinguish whether individuals face actual
financial constraints or whether they are indicative that the perceived benefits of migration do
not exceed the perceived costs.
Together, these results indicate that unilateral facilitation policies related to information, job
search, and documentation assistance are not sufficient to increase rates of international labor
migration. We find evidence of multiple remaining barriers on both the supply side (relatively
low interest on the part of potential migrants) and demand side (highly selective screening for
interviews and job offers) for overseas work. Our findings indicate that policymakers aiming to
expand access to migration, particularly for those in isolated areas, should not expect to achieve
success if relying solely on unilateral migration facilitation, and brings to the fore the role of
complementary bilateral facilitation policies. Investigating the effectiveness of such bilateral
policies is an important avenue for future research.

A1.Data collection and sampling procedure
Baseline survey (2010)
Table A1 presents the full timeline of our project. In early 2010, we selected six
municipalities in Sorsogon for the baseline. These were selected to include both wealthier and
poorer municipalities and both rural and urban areas. We then randomly selected 42 barangays:
11 from the capital of Sorsogon City, 7 from Casiguran, Castilla, Pilar, and Gubat, and 5 from
Castilla and Irosin. Due to security and logistical considerations, three initially selected
barangays were excluded and replaced with the next randomly selected barangay.
We obtained household rosters from each barangay captain, and we sorted households
randomly then targeted the first listed households. Interviewers screened the first person they
approached in the household. To be eligible for our study, the target respondent had to be
between ages 20 and 45, and he or she must have not worked abroad in the past. Households that
had current or past overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) were still eligible for the study. If the first
household member was not eligible or did not want to participate in the survey, the interviewer
asked if anyone else in the household might be eligible, and interviewed that person instead. We
surveyed 5,008 individuals between March and August 2010, and 4,153 were ages 20-40.
Passport follow-up (2011)
In 2011, we launched the second stage of our project to provide some respondents with
assistance obtaining a passport. We revisited a subset of our baseline sample. Specifically, of
respondents ages 20-40, we included all who received the website treatment [T4], all Pilijobs.org
enrollees in other treatment groups (32 respondents), 300 respondents randomly selected from
each information treatment group ([T1], [T2], and [T1]+[T2]), and 300 respondents randomly
selected from the control group.
At the time of the passport survey, we also interviewed and offered passport assistance to a
supplemental sample of Sorsogon Province residents who enrolled in Pilijobs.org through other
means that we describe in the next section (A.2), but who were not a part of our baseline sample.
We do not include these respondents in our analysis.
Endline survey (2012)
We conducted an endline survey in mid-2012 to measure the impacts of our interventions.
We visited all respondents from the baseline sample, making two attempts to reach each

	  

A-1

respondent. We interviewed another household member and administered a proxy survey when
the respondent was not available, enabling us to obtain full data on respondent and household
migration steps and job-search behavior when we could not directly reach the respondent. When
no member of the household could be interviewed, we interviewed a neighbor using a “log”
survey. The information collected in that survey was limited to the respondents’ whereabouts,
and whether he or she was currently working overseas. We show in A.5 that our finding of no
impacts of the treatments on migration abroad are robust to expanding the sample to include
these log surveys.
Using this three-pronged approach, we obtained measures of whether the respondent
migrated abroad for work from full, proxy, or log surveys for 4,089 respondents, or 98.5% of our
sample. Of those, 73% were surveys with the respondents themselves, 20% were proxy surveys,
and 7% were log surveys. Excluding the log surveys, we have a 91% response rate for our full
set of job search and migration outcome variables.
We provide full details on attrition rates in Table A2. In column 1, the dependent variable is
an indicator for the endline either being completely missing or administered only via the log
survey, in which case we are missing the pre-migration outcome measures we examine in
columns 1-7 of Tables 2 and 3. We do not find evidence that either type of attrition is
substantially related to treatment assignment. Coefficients on all treatments are small in
magnitude, and although the coefficient on treatment [T2] + [T3] is individually significant, we
cannot reject the null hypothesis that the treatment assignments are jointly unrelated to attrition.
In column 2, the dependent variable is an indicator for the respondent not being included in
any of our endline surveys (respondent, proxy, or log surveys). Similar to column 2, we find
some evidence of differential attrition for those assigned to treatments [T2] + [T3], significant at
the 5% level. However, the difference in response rates is small in magnitude (only 1.7
percentage points). We use the sample that does not include the log surveys for our main
analysis, and only use this log survey data as a robustness check.
A2.Pilijobs.org
We developed Pilijobs.org in partnership with several Manila-based overseas recruitment
agencies and our local microfinance partner (PALFSI). Pilijobs.org provided applicants with the
opportunity to easily contact and apply for overseas jobs with reputable recruitment agencies,
and allowed those agencies to directly post job opportunities that could be accessed by Sorsogon

	  

A-2

residents. We launched Pilijobs.org in early April 2010, within weeks of the start of the baseline
survey period. Nearly all (91%) of baseline respondents who enrolled in Pilijobs.org did so using
paper forms, so their enrollment is unlikely to be affected by their brief delay between survey
launch and the Pilijobs.org website launch.
In addition to the baseline applicants who enrolled online or through our paper forms, we
recruited other applicants through door-to-door advertising in selected municipalities and
barangays of Sorsogon Province that were not included in our baseline sample. This was done to
ensure the website had enough of a user base to make it attractive to the recruiters. These
applicants also received paper forms that staff encoded and uploaded to the website, and these
advertising efforts all took place after completion of the baseline survey and interventions. We
also advertised with bumper stickers and posters in municipalities that were not part of our
baseline sample. To avoid spillovers, we did not use these general advertising methods in any of
our baseline municipalities. Finally, we marketed Pilijobs.org broadly across the Philippines,
using targeted Facebook advertising. All of these efforts resulted in an additional 5,500 enrollees,
bringing the total enrollment in Pilijobs to roughly 7,100.
A3.Impact on passport acquisition
The payments we disbursed for the passport assistance treatment varied across applicants,
ranging from P1250 (US$28) for just transportation and the passport fee to P2350 (US$52) for
those with additional documentation requirements. Some applicants had costs that could not be
subsidized by the program. For example, the project did not cover the expenses of amending a
birth certificate or other documentation due to misspellings or erroneous information (with costs
as much as P30,000). Approximately 11.6% of respondents initiated the passport process but
were not able to complete it.
Because respondents may have obtained passports without directly interacting with our staff,
these administrative records are not sufficient to test the impact of receiving passport
information. Table A4 reports the impact our assigned treatments on whether respondents
reported in the endline survey that they currently had a valid passport. All treatments that include
passport assistance [T5] have positive effects on passport ownership that are statistically
significant at the 5% level or less. Effect sizes for these treatments range from 7.4 to 12.6
percentage points, which are large compared with the control group rate of 4.5%. In addition, the
most comprehensive treatment that does not include passport assistance [T5], “All information +

	  

A-3

Website” ([T1]+[T2]+[T3]+[T4]), also increases passport ownership by 5.1 percentage points
(statistically significant at the 5% level).
A4.Migration outcomes by region and reported reasons for not migrating
Tables A5 through A8 present data from our endline survey on characteristics of overseas job
offers that respondents reported. This includes the range of occupations (Table A5), destination
countries (Table A6), and migration outcomes by region (Table A7). We also include reported
reasons for not migrating, for those individuals who did receive an overseas job offer, in Table
A8. We discuss these tables in the main text.
A5.Impacts on migration, including endline data from log surveys
All estimation results presented in the main text and here so far use data from respondent or
proxy (other household member) surveys, which account for 91% of endline surveys. As noted
above in column 1 of Table A2, there is no systematic pattern of differential inclusion in the
respondent or proxy surveys related to treatment status.
That said, it is important to confirm that our (absence of) results for the impact of the
treatments on migration overseas are robust to including responses from the “log” surveys of
neighbors, which were administered when neither respondent nor proxy surveys could be
successfully completed. Log surveys were very limited in content, asking only whether the
respondent was currently living overseas and what they were doing abroad. Inclusion of the log
survey responses on whether the respondent was working abroad raises our endline response rate
to 98.5%.
We report the impact of our treatments on whether respondents were currently working
abroad, including log survey responses, in column 1 of Table A9. The results confirm our
previously reported findings that use only the respondent and proxy surveys: there is no evidence
of positive statistically significant impacts of any treatment on migration overseas. Indeed, we
find that some information treatments may have actually reduced international migration. Those
assigned to treatments [T2] + [T3] are 2.0 percentage points less likely to have migrated
overseas, which is significantly different from zero at the 5% level. Some of these differences
could have resulted from the differential attrition observed in Table A2, column 2, though it is
possible that the information we provided respondents with new information on the difficulties
involved in overseas labor migration, discouraging some respondents from seeking to migrate.
However, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that all of the treatment effects are jointly zero.

A6.2013 supplementary survey of job-offer recipients
At the time of the endline survey, 13.8% of those who had received overseas job offers but
had not yet migrated reported that their migration was still pending (column 2, row 2, Table A8).
One possibility we sought to examine was whether our endline survey took place too soon to
capture migration effects. We conducted the endline survey from May through August 2012,
which was between nine months and one year after we offered respondents passport assistance.
Because the passport process was quite time-consuming, some respondents received their
passports as late as three months before the endline survey, and they may not have yet had time
to finish the migration process they initiated when we followed up with them.
To address this concern, in March and April 2013 we re-surveyed respondents who reported
that anyone in their household was offered a job overseas between 2010 and 2012, including
those who had offers they had not yet accepted. We asked them about the status of the offers
they listed in the endline survey, as well as any offers that were received but not listed in the
endline survey, either because they were not reported or because the offer was received after the
endline survey took place.
From our set of baseline respondents, we attempted to contact 196 households, and we
successfully completed 194 surveys (99%). We completed 54% with respondents and 46% with
a proxy household member. (Proxy survey rates are especially high for the 2013 offer survey
because if the respondent was not available at the initial visit but another household member was
willing to participate, we interviewed that member rather than schedule another visit.)
Using this 2013 survey of baseline respondents reporting job offers in the 2012 endline, we
generate a modified indicator of overseas migration, measured nearly two years after initial
passport treatment assignment. This variable modifies the previous “Migrate abroad” variable (in
column 8 of Tables 2, 3, and A10 through A13) by additionally counting a respondent as having
migrated if a job offer they reported in the 2012 endline survey is reported as having led to
migration overseas in the 2013 survey. We did not modify the “Migrate abroad” variable if in the
2013 survey we learned that a respondent migrated but it was the result of a job offer not
reported in the 2012 endline. This is because our objective here was simply to check whether our
results would change if we allowed migration pending as of the 2012 endline to actually lead to
migration. (To have done otherwise would have led to a false inflation of the treatment effect of

	  

A-5

“Full Assistance,” because we only surveyed those with job offers in the 2013 survey, and
because the “Full Assistance” treatment led to a higher rate of job offers.)
Column 2 of Table A9 reports the impacts of our treatments on this modified “Migrate
abroad” variable. Our previous results are confirmed: there are no positive statistically
significant impacts on migration, and impacts are similar in magnitude to the migration outcomes
reported in column 8 of Table 2.

A.7. Additional specifications
In Tables A10 and A11, we present the full set of results from the specifications used in
Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
Tables A12 and A13 demonstrate that our previous results are robust to including individuals
ages 41-45 in our sample. These individuals, as described earlier, were part of our baseline
survey. However, we learned there are few overseas opportunities for new migrants over 40. We
restricted our passport sample to individuals aged 20-40 years old, and we define our baseline
sample similarly, which better reflects the target population of unilateral migration facilitation
efforts.
