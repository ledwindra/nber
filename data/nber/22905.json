    "abstract": "\n\nMany stylized facts of leverage, trading, and asset prices obtain in a frictionless general equilibrium model that features agents\u2019 heterogeneity in endowments and time- varying risk preferences. Our model predicts that aggregate debt increases in expansions when asset prices are high, volatility is low, and levered households enjoy a \u201cconsumption boom.\u201d Our model is consistent with poorer households borrowing more and with intermediaries\u2019 leverage being a priced factor. In crises, levered households strongly delever by \u201cfire selling\u201d their risky assets as asset prices drop. Yet, as empirically observed, their debt-to-wealth ratios increase as higher discount rates make their wealth decline faster.\n\n",
