ABSTRACT
Globalization is expected to be reversed, at least partially, in the post pandemic era. The Great
Financial Recession of 2008–10 marked a historic turning point in the direction of weakening the
degree of global economic integration. Now, in the post-pandemic era, policymakers appear
poised to take deliberate steps to reinforce the movement toward de-globalization. At the same
time, safety nets are expected to be strengthened. In this paper, we develop a model, with which
we analyze central macroeconomic interactions between globalization and safety nets. We put
together stylized elements of trade globalization, financial globalization, international tax
competition, immigration, and welfare state, all in a two-skill, two-period stylized model, where
policy (taxes and social benefits) is determined through majority voting.

Abstract:
Globalization is expected to be reversed, at least partially, in the post pandemic era. The
Great Financial Recession of 2008–10 marked a historic turning point in the direction of
weakening the degree of global economic integration. Now, in the post-pandemic era,
policymakers appear poised to take deliberate steps to reinforce the movement toward deglobalization. At the same time, safety nets are expected to be strengthened. In this paper, we
develop a model, with which we analyze central macroeconomic interactions between
globalization and safety nets. We put together stylized elements of trade globalization, financial
globalization, international tax competition, immigration, and welfare state, all in a two-skill, twoperiod stylized model, where policy (taxes and social benefits) is determined through majority
voting.

Introduction
The corona virus pandemic alters the interactions among globalization, migration and
redistribution policies will take. Throughout history, crisis and human progress have often gone
hand in hand. The growing COVID-19 pandemic could strengthen nationalism and isolationism
and accelerate the retreat from globalization. The COVID-19 pandemic is driving the world
economy to retreat from global economic integration. National security and public health concerns
are providing new rationales for protectionism.

One aspect of a lack of resilience of the last decades of globalization to Corona Virus
Pandemic is that value (supply) chains that were highly vulnerable. They were not sufficiently
diversified. They were sensitive to interruptions caused by either a pandemic like this one or trade
conflicts. The recent backlash against trade globalization is not a new phenomenon, either.
International trade increased rapidly after 1990, fueled by the growth of a complex network of
global value chains (GVCs). These chains represent the process of ever-finer specialization and
geographic fragmentation of production. In the wake of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis,
uncertainty in the world economy led many firms to reassess their business models. Rather than
relying on global supply chains, an increasing number of firms invested in robots, which prompted
a renaissance of manufacturing in industrialized countries. The global value chains could be
reshuffled, or be reduced. Whether they will be localized or regionalized, or whether the crisis will
lead to the continuation of globalization. The expectation is that the COVID-19 crisis will
structurally transform globalization on the long-term.

There exists large body of international trade literature on impediments to trade in goods due to border
related friction cost: country specific standards, regulations, technical barriers to trade, together with

product-specific information costs, increase border effects. By the Lerner’s Symmetry, any wedge
between the domestic and the world prices applied to the importable good is equivalent to a wedge between
world and domestic prices applied to the exportable good.
The “border effect” in international trade refers to a situation in which there is higher volume of trade
within a country compared with the volume of trade across the country's borders. Gravity equations have

been widely used to infer trade-flow effects of various institutional arrangements. They have been
especially successful

to explain the

border-effect puzzle. McCallum (1995) estimates a

conventional gravity model where bilateral trade between Canadian provinces, or between a
Canadian province and US state, should depend on each of their province or state GDP has and
distance from the country’s centers. His study uses 1988 data, just before the Canada–US free
trade agreement was signed, Although trade economists were not surprised at the existence of a border
effect, they find significant size of the estimated effect in McCallum (1995) perplexing. Anderson and

van Wincoop (2001) study

show why previous empirical studies have had an upward bias in the

estimation of the border effect. Anderson and van Wincoop (2001) argue that border effects have

an asymmetric effect on countries of different size, and in particular, have a larger effect on small
countries. They show previous border-effect estimations suffer from omitted variables bias. They
allow the omitted variables in, and find that national borders reduce trade between industrialized
countries by still significant amounts of 20-50 percent. Chen (2004), and Chen and Novy (2011),
identify industry-specific trade barriers that are responsible for border effects such as country
specific standards, regulations, etc. Fouquin, and Hugot (2016), use a gravity theory-grounded

measure to create a rich data set of bilateral relative trade costs. The trade costs are aggregated to

obtain world indices, as well as indices along various trade routes. They find that the post-WWII
fall of trade costs in recent times began in Europe before extending to the rest of the world.
The present paper focuses on the gradual process of diminishing border effects (that is, the
increased intensity of trade globalization) on domestic factor prices and income inequality. For
this purpose, our model applies a standard factor proportion (Heckscher-Ohlin) model, except that
factors’ supply is endogenous in the model. The endogeneity of labor supply stems from the
possibility of high-skilled emigration. The endogeneity of capital supply arises from the
endogeneity of domestic savings. The model lends itself in a straightforward manner to an analysis
of the effect of the world prices of final goods on domestic factor prices a la Stolper and Samuelson
(1941). In addition, the model includes a reinforcing effect whereby the change in the domestic
factor prices, triggers capital formation through savings a la Rybsczinski (1955). Increased trade
globalization intensity means simply an exogenous reduction in the wedge between world prices
and domestic final good prices. Naturally, this Stolper-Samuelson type changes in domestic factor
price changes trigger a standard reallocation process of domestic factors of production across
sectors and affect the prices of domestic factors of production. Furthermore, the ensuing changes
in factor prices trigger changes in savings and capital formation. The induced changes in highskilled emigration and capital formation lead in turn to changes in the factor supply. The latter
work through the Rybsczinski mechanism on re-configuration of sectoral outputs, and thus, the
volume of international trade.

2. International Tax Competition

Financial globalization triggers tax competition among countries, and the possibility of a “race to
the bottom”. 4 As a result, the tax burden may shift from the highly mobile factors (e.g. capital and
top-skilled labor) to the weakly mobile factors (e.g. low-skill labor). This shift has first-order
implications for both the functional and the size distribution of income. A country that imposes
high tax rates may push mobile factors (especially capital) abroad where the country cannot
effectively tax them, eroding its own tax base and lowering domestic economic activity at the same
time. It

may significantly affect corporate financing and location decisions of both US, and

European, multinational groups. In consequence, the enhanced competitive pressure could result
in an erosion of foreign countries’ tax bases and an associated loss in tax revenue triggering a new
wave of international tax competition. 5 Figure 1 gives evidence for the intensity of corporate tax
competition following the launch of the European Union.

The Economist magazine put it succinctly: “Globalization is a tax problem for three reasons. First, firms have more
freedom over where to locate. This will make it harder for a country to tax a business much more heavily than its
competitors will. Second, globalization makes it hard to decide where a company should pay tax, regardless of
where it is based. This gives them [the companies] plenty of scope to reduce tax bills by shifting operations around
or by creating transfer pricing. Third, globalization nibbles away at the edges of taxes on Individuals. It is harder to
tax personal income because skilled professional workers are more mobile than they were two decades ago."
5 Michael Devereux, Rachel Griffith and Alexander Klemm (2002) analyze the development of taxes on corporate
income in EU and G7 countries over the 1980s and the 1990sthey establish that tax revenues on profitable
investments had fallen. In particular, taxes on income earned by multinational firms are subject to tax competition
forces. Additional evidence pertaining to international tax competition for relatively mobile portfolio investments,
so that a country with more mobility has lower capital tax rates, is abundant. See empirical support for the
hypothesis in Hines (1999), Sorensen (2002), Besley, Griffith and Klemm (2001), Devereux and Griffith (2002), and
Lassen and Sorensen (2002), Razin, Sadka, and Nam (2004), and Krautheim and Schmidt-Eisenhor (2011).

3. Global financial globalization
We capture the degree of financial globalization by the ease with which capital flows from one
country to another. We assume a pure source-based income taxation. This means that the country
does not impose taxes on foreign-source income of its residents, but taxes foreigners on their
income originating within the country. 7
Capital income of residents and foreigners (from domestic sources only) is taxed at a flat rate 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 .

Therefore; the net return on investing into domestic capital is 1 + 𝑟𝑟(1 − 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 ) for investors, where
r is the domestic interest rate.

6

Calculations based on the well-known work of Hall and Jorgenson (1967), who introduced the user cost of capital
approach; applied to international data by King and Fullerton (1984). Figure 1 follows the formula for the effective tax
rate on corporate income (𝜏𝜏𝑒𝑒 ), as refined by Auerbach (1983):
𝜏𝜏𝑒𝑒 =

(𝑟𝑟 + 𝛿𝛿)(1 − 𝜏𝜏𝑠𝑠 𝑧𝑧) − (𝑟𝑟 + 𝛿𝛿)(1 − 𝜏𝜏𝑠𝑠 )
(𝑟𝑟 + 𝛿𝛿)(1 − 𝜏𝜏𝑠𝑠 𝑧𝑧) − 𝛿𝛿(1 − 𝜏𝜏𝑠𝑠 )

where
 − Real cost of funds (real rate of return the firm must earn after corporate taxes by the instruction of its
shareholders).
𝛿𝛿 − physical rate of depreciation (assumed exponential)
𝜏𝜏𝑠𝑠 − statutory corporate tax rate
 − Present value of depreciation allowances.

Under the source principle of international taxation only income from domestic sources is subject to a tax,
whereas foreign-source income is exempt. Under the residence principle, in contrast, resident income is taxed on a
worldwide basis. Razin and Sadka (2017) illustrate diagrammatically the efficiency disadvantage of the equilibrium
under the source principle, compared to the residence equilibrium. Because (as in the Diamond-Mirrlees (1971);
the production efficiency proposition) and M the consumption possibilities frontier shrinks under the source
principle, relative to the frontier under the residence principle, the latter is more efficient. However, tax revenue
collection tends to be larger under the former, because of the existence of tax havens and lack of sufficient
international tax coordination. The tax-competition setup of source taxation is more pronounced in sourcetaxation than in residence taxation .Note, for instance, that tax competition has little influence on capital taxation
under the residence principle with cross-country information sharing.

7

Assume that capital does flow internationally, but at some cost 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 > 0 per unit. 8 A domestic
individual who invests abroad can thus gain only 1 + (1 − 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾∗ )𝑟𝑟 ∗ − 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 , where 𝑟𝑟 ∗ is the world
interest rate and 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾∗ is the tax rate, levied abroad under a source-based taxation. In a small, open

economy context, the two (exogenous) variables 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾∗ and 𝑟𝑟 ∗ play an equivalent role, where the only

relevant variable is 𝑅𝑅 ∗ = (1 − 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾∗ )𝑟𝑟 ∗ , which is the net of tax international interest rate.

We assume that the cost of capital flows applies symmetrically to foreign investors, i.e. their return
on investment in the domestic country is given by1 + (1 − 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾 )𝑟𝑟 − 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 , where investing abroad

yields a return 𝑅𝑅 ∗ .

The small open economy exports capital in case:
(1) (1 − 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾 )𝑟𝑟 = 𝑅𝑅 ∗ − 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 ,

which means that(1 − 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾 )𝑟𝑟 − 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 < 𝑅𝑅 ∗ , and therefore foreigners do not invest in the domestic

economy.

Similarly, the small open economy imports capital in case:
(2) (1 − 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾 )𝑟𝑟 − 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 = 𝑅𝑅 ∗ ,
This cost may generate home bias of investment, as in the case of information asymmetry. See Razin, Sadka, and
Yuen (1998). The parameter 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 captures (albeit in a reduced form) a group of frictions, contractual and
informational. Such frictions, which affect the volume and the composition and the volatility of international capital
flows, cause deviations from the “law of one rate of return”. As an example, foreign direct investors get more
efficient outcomes than foreign portfolio investors do. The reason is that foreign direct investors have direct control
over management. Thus, they are able to make a better-informed decision of how to run the business. However, the
better information mires FDI investors with the “lemons” problem: If the investors’ liquidity in the source country
dries up, forcing the investors to sell off their foreign subsidiaries, market participants would not know whether the
subsidiary is liquidated because of the investors’ liquidity problems, or because of bad inside information about the
profitability of the subsidiary. Consequently, the market will place a discount on assets sold by an FDI investor, who
has the inside information, unlike the foreign portfolio investment, which has no inside information about
profitability of the investment. The “law of one rate of return” is not applicable to foreign direct investment because
of the “lemon problem”. See Goldstein and Razin (2006).

8

which means that (1 − 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾 )𝑟𝑟 > 𝑅𝑅 ∗ − 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 , and therefore the residents of the small open economy
do not wish to invest abroad.

Remarkably, the foreign tax parameter, 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾∗ , with which the domestic tax rate, 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾 , competes, and

the financial globalization parameter, 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 , have similar effects on the small open economy when it

exports capital; but the opposite effects when it imports capital. Specifically, when 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾∗ and 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 fall,

then capital export is boosted in the capital-export case. This is because the net return abroad to
domestic savers rises. Therefore simulating the tax competition effect on the welfare state
economy of reduced 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾∗ is equivalent to the effect of a reduced 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 ; both indicate that the
globalization forces intensify. However, in the capital import case, a fall in 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾∗ the net return

abroad to foreign savers increases, and therefore capital imports by the domestic economy
diminishes. A fall in 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 however raises the net return for foreign investors in the domestic
economy, which boosts capital, imports. Therefore simulating the tax competition effect on the

welfare state economy of reduced 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾∗ has the opposite effect of a reduced 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 .

4. A Model
The paper’s focus is twofold: (i) the effects of globalization on the volumes of capital flows, the
volume of trade, the emigration of high-skill labor, and income distribution. And, (ii) the role of
the welfare state, as shaped by majority voting, in enhancing the welfare of many (rather than just
a few) income groups in the presence of globalization and tax competition forces.

To put trade and financial globalization, tax competition, high-skilled emigration, and the
generosity of the welfare state, all in a coherent analytical framework, we develop here a politicaleconomy model, where the welfare state parameters (taxes and social benefits) are determined
through majority voting 9. It is a stripped-down model consisting of the essential (minimal)
features, which allow us to analyze these issues.
To enable us to consider trade in goods we assume that there minimally are two tradable goods (x
and y). In the absence of uncertainty and differentiated products, each sector will either export or
import its standard product, but not both at the same time. World prices of x and y are exogenously
given for our small open economy with good x serving as a numeraire, whose price is normalized
to one, and the world price of y is denoted by p*.

There is an impediment to trade in goods. Specifically, goods can be exported, but again only at
some border related friction cost (e.g., country specific standards, regulations, etc.). For
concreteness of the notation, we consider y as an export good. A similar and straightforward
notation applies when x is the export good. 10 We denote this cost per unit of price by 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 , so that

the domestic price of the export good y is

(3)

𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 =

𝑝𝑝∗

�1 + 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 �

.

This is an extension of a model developed in (Razin and Sadka (2018).

10

By the Lerner Symmetry proposition, any wedge between the domestic and the world prices applied to

importables, is equivalent to a wedge between world and domestic prices applied to exportables.

In order to consider redistribution issues, which are at the heart of the welfare state, we assume
that there minimally are two types of individuals -- low skilled-poor (indexed 𝑢𝑢) and high-skilled
–rich (indexed 𝑠𝑠).There are two types of factors of production—capital (K) and labor (L). The

workers have two types of skills—low (l) and high (h). Labor market productivity of the skilled
individual is 1 and labor market productivity of the unskilled individual is 𝜌𝜌 < 1.

Each high-skill individual is endowed with 𝑥𝑥̅𝑠𝑠 units of good x, and 𝑦𝑦�𝑠𝑠 units of good y , respectively,

in the first period; a low-skill individual is endowed with only 𝜃𝜃 < 1 units of the skilled

endowements. Thus, an skilled-rich individual enjoys both higher initial endowment (“wealth”),
and higher labor market skill than the unskilled-poor individual.

The overall size of the initial native-born population is normalized to one, where a proportion λ of

the population is of high skill and a proportion 1 − λ is of low skill. We denote by 𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 ≥ 0 the

number of high-skill emigrants. Note that when λ < 0.5, then the low-skill form a majority and

will be decisive in the voting process. When λ − 𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 > 0.5, assuming that emigrants do not

participate in the political process, the high skill form the majority and are decisive in the voting
process.
To consider saving and investment we assume that there minimally are two periods (1 and 2).
A representative firm produces good 𝑔𝑔 according to a constant-returns-to scale technology:

𝑔𝑔 = 𝐴𝐴𝑔𝑔 𝐹𝐹𝑔𝑔 �𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 , 𝐿𝐿𝑔𝑔 � = 𝐴𝐴𝑔𝑔 𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 𝑔𝑔 𝐿𝐿𝑔𝑔

,

𝑔𝑔 = 𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦,

where, 𝐾𝐾g is the input of physical capital, and 𝐿𝐿𝑔𝑔 is labor, measured in efficiency units, used in

the respective production process. 𝐴𝐴𝑔𝑔 > 0 is a total factor productivity coefficient, and 𝛼𝛼𝑔𝑔 and

1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑔𝑔 are, respectively, the capital and labor shares in the sector producing 𝑔𝑔.

Capital is employed together with labor in the first period with output generated in the second
period. We assume that labor is paid in the second period, at the end of the production process.
Capital (𝐾𝐾) is a composite good, produced in the first period as of a variable mix of 𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘 and 𝑦𝑦𝑘𝑘 ,
according to:
(5)

𝐾𝐾 = 𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘 𝛽𝛽 𝑦𝑦𝑘𝑘 1−𝛽𝛽 , where 0 < β <1.

To find the cost minimizing mix of x and y, of which a unit of capital (K) is composed of, one, has
to solve the following problem:
min(𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘 + 𝑝𝑝1 𝑦𝑦𝑘𝑘 )
(𝑥𝑥,𝑦𝑦)

subject to:
𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘 𝛽𝛽 𝑦𝑦𝑘𝑘 1−𝛽𝛽 ≥ 1 ,

where 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 is the domestic price of 𝑦𝑦 in period 𝑡𝑡 = 1,2.

Solving this problem yields also the unit price 𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘 of capital as

𝐿𝐿𝑆𝑆 = λ − 𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 + (1 − λ )𝜌𝜌 .

Demands for labor and capital are given, respectively, by the marginal productivity conditions in
both sectors. Note that because labor and capital move freely between the two sectors, then the
factors of production earn the same remuneration across sectors, that is:

; 𝑤𝑤 is the wage rare per efficiency

unit, paid in the second period after the completion of the production process. Note that for
simplicity we assume that capital fully depreciates at the end of the production process.

We denote by 𝑐𝑐𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔1 the consumption of good g = x,y by an individual of type i = u,s in period t =
1,2. All individuals have identical preferences, given by

(𝑐𝑐𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥1 𝑎𝑎 𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦11−𝑎𝑎 )𝑏𝑏 (𝑐𝑐𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥2 𝑎𝑎 𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦21−𝑎𝑎 )1−𝑏𝑏 + 𝑑𝑑𝐵𝐵 𝛾𝛾 ,

where 0 < a < 1, 0 < b < 1, d > 0, 𝛾𝛾 > 0, and 𝐵𝐵 is a uniform social benefit (provided in an equal

amount to all individuals), assumed (for simplicity) to be provided in the second period only. This

social benefit captures the various ingredients that a welfare state provides, such as health services,
education, in-kind transfers, etc. Note that the social benefit is not a perfect substitute to private
consumption 11.
Individual budget constraints for period 1 and 2 are given, respectively, by:

𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖

(13)

(14)

= 𝑥𝑥̅ 𝑖𝑖 + 𝑝𝑝1 𝑦𝑦�𝑖𝑖 − 𝑐𝑐𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥1

.

+ 𝑝𝑝2 𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦2 ,

where, 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 is domestic saving of individual i = u, s. Observe that when

(1 − λ )𝑆𝑆𝑢𝑢 +

( λ − 𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 )𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 − 𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘 (𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 + 𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦 ) is positive, then capital is exported and equation (1) is relevant;

whereas when (1 − λ )𝑆𝑆𝑢𝑢 + ( λ − 𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 )𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 − 𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘 (𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 + 𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦 ) is negative, then capital is imported
and equation (2) is relevant.

We abstract from a tax on the initial endowments because these are in fixed supply at the beginning
of the first period, and a tax on them is not distortive; it will tend to be extremely high. Furthermore,
when the low-skill form the majority, they will tax them at a rate of 100%. For a similar reason,
we abstract also from a tax on consumption (VAT) because it is equivalent to a tax on wages
(which are taxed directly in our model), and a tax on the initial endowments (see, for instance,
Frenkel, Razin and Sadka (1991)).

11

In our model, the redistribution made by the welfare state is in the form of an in-kind benefit.

Finally, consider the government, which is active in a balanced-budget way only in the second
period. Its budget constraint is:

(21)

(1 − 𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 )𝐵𝐵 = 𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 + 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘 (𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 + 𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦 ).

Note that the government taxes capital income of both domestic residents and foreigners which
originates in the domestic economy, 𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘 (𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 + 𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦 ). This means that when saving of domestic

residents exceeds domestic investment, 𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘 (𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 + 𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦 ), with the excess invested abroad, then this

excess is not taxed at home. Converesely, when savings of domestic residents fall short of domestic
investment, 𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘 (𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 + 𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦 ), with the shortage financed by foreigners, then this shortage is taxed by
the domestic government.

𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (1−λ)𝑆𝑆𝑢𝑢 +(𝜆𝜆−𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 )𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 ≤ 𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘(𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 + 𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦 )

.

Note that when the country exports capital (that is, (1 − λ)𝑆𝑆𝑢𝑢 + (𝜆𝜆 − 𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 )𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 > 𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘 (𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 + 𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦 )),

then it incurrs the cost of 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 on its capital exports. Conversely, when foreigners invest in the

domestic economy (that is, (1 − λ)𝑆𝑆𝑢𝑢 + (𝜆𝜆 − 𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 )𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 < 𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘 (𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 + 𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦 )), then the country pays

foreiners only 1 + (1 − 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 )𝑟𝑟 , because they are taxed on their income originating in the domestic

economy; foreigners bears the friction cost 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 in this case. Note, however, that it follows from

equations (13) – (14) that equation (22) is redundant, as it merely states that exports/imports of
goods and capital are allowed.

Clearance in the labor market yields:

𝐿𝐿𝑆𝑆 = 𝐿𝐿𝑥𝑥 + 𝐿𝐿𝑦𝑦 .

(1)

We allow skilled individuals to emigrate abroad according to the following equation:

(26)

𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 = 𝑍𝑍(𝑢𝑢𝑆𝑆∗ − 𝑢𝑢𝑠𝑠 ) 𝑧𝑧

with 𝑍𝑍 > 0, 0 < 𝑧𝑧 < 1.

where 𝑢𝑢𝑠𝑠∗ is the (exogenously given) utility level attained by s-individuals who reside abroad. Note

that the number of emigrants depends positively on the foreign-domestic utility differential, 𝑢𝑢𝑆𝑆∗ −

𝑢𝑢𝑠𝑠 .

As for the welfare state features in the model, we assume that the tax-transfer policy (that is, the
choice of 𝑡𝑡𝐿𝐿 , 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 and B) are determined by majority voting. Because the individuals in each of the
two skill groups are identical, the larger group determines policies, according to its own
preferences.. Thus, when λ is less than 0.5 (and so is λ − 𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 ), the u-individuals form the majority,

and the tax-transfer policy is determined so as to maximize the u-individual utility level (that is,
𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢 ). This regime is henceforth referred to as the u-regime. Similarly, when λ − 𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 (which is not
an exogenous variable) is larger than 0.5, the tax-transfer policy is determined by the s-individuals,
to maximize their utility level, 𝑢𝑢𝑠𝑠 . This regime is henceforth referred to as the s-regime.

The forces of trade and financial globalization are intertwined in their implications for income
distribution and tax-transfer policies. To get a better insight into these interdependent effects we
consider separately trade globalization and financial globalization.

We resort to numerical simulations in order to characterize these two regimes. In particular, we
study how globalization (as proxied by the friction costs 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 and 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 ), and how tax competition (as
expressed by the tax parameters 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘 and 𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘∗ ) affect these two regimes.

5. Trade globalization and Welfare-State Policies
In this section we start with the study of trade globalization, income distribution and the welfare
state. For this purpose, we shut off the channel of international financial flows in the model. Our
focus is on the implications of trade globalization through these effects for income distribution and
the ensuing political-economy benefits and taxes. As we shall see, these implications depends on:
(i) the factor abundance of our small open economy and the related factor intensity of the export
good; (ii) on whether or not there is complete specialization in the export good. 12

12

Schott (2003) points to failure of existing attempts to ﬁnd support for the idea that a country’s

endowments determine its production and trade. These attempts have traditionally focused on the
overly restrictive, “one size ﬁts all” equilibrium of Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) trade theory. In this
view all countries of the world producing all goods, so that both Japan and the Philippines, for
example, are assumed to produce identical electronics and apparel goods using the same
techniques. A second, far richer equilibrium is possible within the framework, however, in which
countries specialize in the particular subset of goods most suited to their mix of endowments, so
that relatively labor-abundant Philippines might produce labor intensive t-shirts and portable
radios while capital-abundant Japan manufactures capital intensive semiconductors and satellites.

5.1 Capital-Abundant Economy
Suppose that good y is more capital intensive than good x. Suppose further that our small open
economy is more capital abundant relative to the rest of the world. This means that the world
relative price of y (namely 𝑝𝑝∗ ) is higher than the domestic autarky relative price of good y.

Recall that we measure the degree of trade globalization by the parameter 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 , which is an
impediment to trade in goods (equation (1)). First, we examine how trade globalization affects the

income distribution in the absence of the welfare state (that is, 𝑡𝑡𝐿𝐿 = 𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾 = 𝐵𝐵 = 0). Then, we

examine how the welfare state responds to trade globalization under the two configurations of
political power balance: (i) Skill-rich majority; (ii) Unskilled-poor majority.

With sufficiently high 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 , the country is in autarky. Naturally, the autarkic relative price of the
would-be export good lies below the world relative price. In this range, a decline in 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 does not

affect the domestic prices, as long as the economy is still in autarky. When 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 continues to fall,
the country opens up to trade in goods; it exports good y and imports good x. In this non-autarkic

regime, a decline in 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 raises, as expected, the domestic price of the export good (y) toward the
world price p* (see equation (3)). Figure 2(a) shows that as 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 decreases, the autarky ceases to

exist first when the skilled form the majority in the welfare state 13. As 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 further declines, then the

autarky collapses with the absence of the welfare state; Next, the autarky collapses last (in response

Schott (2003) develops a methodology and provides evidence in support of a full-specialization,
Heckscher-Ohlin equilibrium.

13

to a decrease in 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 ) when the unskilled form the majority in a welfare state. As long as the
impediment to trade is strong enough (that is, 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 is sufficiently high), the volume of exports is

flat. As 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 declines and autarky ceases to exist, export rise in response to the increase in its

domestic price, 𝑝𝑝2 , as shown in Figure 2(b). As 𝑝𝑝2 rises, more labor and capital shift to the export

sector (from the importable sector), until complete specialization in the export sector occurs (and

the importable good is no longer domestically produced). 14 In accordance with Figure 2(a),
complete specialization occurs first when the skilled form the majority in the welfare state. Second,
is the no-welfare-state case, and last is when the unskilled form the majority in the welfare state.
Regardless of the intensity of globalization, the volume of exports is largest when the skilled-rich
form the majority, intermediate in the no-welfare-state case, and smallest when the unskilled-poor
form the majority. 15

(b) The volume of exports
Note: For parameter values, see Appendix.

14

With full specialization, the factor price ratio, w/r, becomes constant. That is with further changes in 𝛿𝛿𝐾𝐾 w and r
increase by the same proportions, and the intertemporal price that drives saving and capital formation is flat.
Therefore, the output of exportable y reaches its upper limit and becomes flat as well. With full specialization, the
value of output is py. From Cobb Douglas preferences, agents have constant expenditure shares. That is, priceweighted consumption of exportable is a fraction ∅ of value of output 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑦𝑦 = ∅𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝, implying 𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦 = ∅𝑦𝑦. Therefore, if y
reaches the upper limit and becomes constant with respect to further changes in 𝛿𝛿𝐾𝐾 , 𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦 and exports, 𝑦𝑦 − 𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦 ,
become flat as well.
In the parameter values employed in the simulations, there is no complete specialization when the unskilled
form the majority in the welfare state even when there is no trade impediment (𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 = 0).
15

Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 2 suggest that when the export good is more capital intensive (relative
to the import good) in a capital-abundant country (relative to the rest of the world), then: (i) the

skilled-rich are most pro-globalization; (ii) the unskilled-poor are least pro-globalization; and, (iii)
the case of no welfare state is in between.
Figure 3 describes the effect of increased trade globalization on the pre-tax factor prices. Parallel
to Figure 1, the flat segments reflect autarky (for high values of 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 ). Once 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 falls below the
autarky threshold, the return to capital rises and the wage falls in response to increased
globalization, as predicted by the Stolper-Samuelson mechanism; see Figure 2(a), which shows
that the relative price of capital-intensive good rises. When complete specialization occurs (and
this happens for our parameter values only in the no-welfare regime, or when the skilled form the
majority), then both factor prices rise as the degree of globalization intensifies. Note also that in
the case of a one-good production the two-factor prices rise at the same rate—the rate of increase
of the domestic price of the export good.
Figure 3 (the capital abundant case): Pre-tax Factor Prices
(a) Wage
(b) Domestic return to capital
Note: For parameter values, see Appendix.

Figure 4 describes the effect of increased globalization on the taxes and the social benefit. There
are several patterns to note. First, when the skilled form the majority, they levy taxes on labor only.
Analogously, when the unskilled form the majority, they levy taxes on capital only. This pattern

holds even though the two classes own both capital and labor. However, for our parameter values
(the skill-premium 𝜌𝜌 and the wealth disparity), the skill-rich have higher stake in their capital
income, whereas the unskilled-poor have higher stake in their labor income. 16

A second related pattern is that both classes maintain the welfare state when they form the majority.
In this regard, we note that the social benefit B is essential as it consists of some goods and services
that the market does not provide (e.g., job security, health care, etc.). The third pattern is that, as
the degree of globalization intensifies, the tax on labor (respectively, capital) rises when the skilled
(respectively, the unskilled) form the majority, and then declines. Indeed each class has an
incentive to raise the tax that hurts more the other class, but at some point, the distortion caused
by the higher tax stops and reverses the rising trend. When the skill-rich raise the labor tax, the
distortion stems from skilled emigration. When the unskilled-poor raise the capital tax, the
distortion stems from both the skilled emigration and the reduced savings and capital formation.
Figure 4 (the capital-abundant case): Taxes and Social Benefits

(b) Labor
(c) Social Benefit

One may wonder why there are still tax and social benefit changes in the economy in the l autarky state as 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘
falls, for the welfare state regime. The reason is that the pure market forces (indicated by the graph of when the
welfare state is shut off) are leading to greater exports. The welfare state reacts in the presence of such market
pressures by levying taxes and providing social benefits which exports for a range of values of 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 , until its value is
sufficiently low. At this point, the welfare state gives in to the “market forces” , and exports begin to rise.

5.2 Labor-Abundant Economy
We turn now to a different set of parameter values that renders our small open economy to be a
labor-abundant relative to the rest of the world. That is the autarky price of the export good which
is now the labor-intensive good (good x) is below the world price of that good (1/p*).
As can be seen in Figure 2’, as the degree of globalization intensifies (that is, as 𝛿𝛿𝑥𝑥 declines), the
first departure from autarky occurs when the unskilled-poor form the majority. Next, is the case
of no welfare state; and the last departure from autarky occurs when the skilled-rich form the
majority. A mirror image is what happens to the volume of exports after the departure from
autarky: it is the largest when the unskilled-poor form the majority; intermediate under the nowelfare-state regime, and smallest when the skilled-rich form the majority.
As in the capital-abundance case, also in the labor abundance case, when the skilled-rich form the
majority, they levy taxes on labor only. Analogously, when the unskilled-poor form the majority,
they levy taxes on capital only.
In contrast to the capital-abundance case, it is now the unskilled-poor who are the most proglobalization; the skilled-rich are the least pro-globalization; and in the absence of a welfare state
system, the economy’s posture toward globalization is in between. 17

6. Financial Globalization
We turn now to the case of financial globalization. As before, we capture the ease of globalization
by the level of the friction cost 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 . A lower level of 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 means a higher degree of financial

globalization. Note that in the case of capital exports (corresponding to a positive sum of net

foreign assets position), a decline in 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 raises the return to investing abroad, and thereby stimulates

it (see equation (1)). In the case of capital imports (corresponding to a negative sum of net foreign
assets position) , a decline in 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 raises the return to foreigners on their investment in our small

open economy, and thereby accelerates it (see equation (2)). We divide the discussion into two

different capital-account regimes: financial capital exports (for high saving economies) and capital
imports (low saving economies). 18
6.1 Capital Exports
We consider first the case of capital exports.
Figure 6(a)

suggests, as expected, that a decline in 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 increases unambiguously the export of

capital. The mirror image of this graph is illustrated in Figure 6(b) where we can see that the higher

volume of capital exports decreases the stock of domestic capital. This result holds no matter
whether the skilled-rich or unskilled-poor form the majority; or whether the welfare state is
present.
Figure 6: Capital Exports and Domestic Capital

18

Furceri et al (2019), using industry- level data, for the empirical significance of this
distinction. They demonstrate that industry-level output gains associated with capital account
liberalization are small and not statistically different between sectors with low external financial
dependence – a key channel through which financial globalization may enhance firms’
investment (Rajan and Zingalez (1998)). In contrast, the declines in industry labor shares
following liberalization are economically and statistically significant and long lasting. They also
find that the decline in labor shares is higher the more substitutable are labor and capital in the
production process, and the greater are firms’ natural layoff rates – a proxy for the (lack of)
bargaining power of labor – in response to idiosyncratic shocks.

(a)Volume of capital exports
(b) Stock of domestic capital
(c) Savings; Note: For parameter values, see Appendix.

Interestingly, both the skilled-rich and the unskilled-poor increase the level of capital exports,
relative to the case of no-welfare-state, for all levels of 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 . As expected, with source based capital

taxation in the welfare state, which exempts capital exported abroad from taxes, while levying
taxes on capital invested at home, the incentive to export capital is amplified. One may wonder
why, notwithstanding

the fact that the welfare state encourages capital exports, the domestic

stock of capital is nevertheless still larger in the presence of the welfare state, relative to the case
of no-welfare-state. The reason is that the welfare state enhances wellbeing and boosts domestic
saving (see Figure 6(c). Naturally, when the capital-labor ratio falls, as the result of capital exports,
pre-tax return to capital return to capital rises and the pre-tax wage falls.

Figure 7 presents the effect of increased globalization on the taxes and the social benefit.
Both when the skilled-rich form the majority, or the unskilled-poor form the majority they levy
taxes on both capital and labor. As globalization intensifies and the capital tax base shrinks, as a
result of capital outflows, both types of majority raise taxes on labor and capital. The social benefit,
B, being essential, consisting of some goods and services that the market does not provide(e.g.,

job security, health care, etc.) rise moderately as 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 falls and wellbeing is ameliorated .

Figure 7 (The capital-export case): Taxes and Social Benefits

(b) Labor tax rate
(c) The volume of social benefits
Note: for parameter values, see Appendix.

Naturally, the welfare state, which provides the social benefit B, raises utility for all, independently
of who form the majority and of the degree of globalization.

6.2 Capital Imports
We turn now to the case of capital imports.
Figure 8(a) suggests, as expected, that a decline in 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 increases unambiguously the imports of
capital, in the absence of a welfare state (where market forces work alone). The mirror image of
this graph is illustrated in Figure 8(b), where we can see that the higher volume of capital imports
increases, naturally, the stock of domestic capital. Note also that when the stock of domestic
capital increases, then the return to capital falls and the wage rate rises. Naturally, very high values

of 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 deter capital imports altogether, and the small open economy is in a financial autarky. Note

that as 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 falls the economy moves out of the autarky state first in the case of no welfare state;

second, when the skilled-rich form the majority; and third, when the unskilled-poor form the

majority. 19

Interestingly, the unskilled-poor lower the level of capital imports more than the skilled-rich; the
both reduce capital imports relative to the case of no-welfare-state. As expected, with source based
capital taxation, which taxes capital imported from abroad, the incentive of foreigners to invest
in the small open economy are dampened by the existence of the welfare state. One may wonder
why the domestic stock of capital is nevertheless still larger when the skilled-rich

form the

majority, relative the no welfare state case, even though they discourage capital imports (see
Figure 8(b)). The reason is that the welfare state in this case boosts domestic saving sufficiently
(see Figure 8(c)) to compensate for the squeezed capital inflow.
Figure 8: Capital imports and the stock of domestic capital
(a) The volume of capital imports
(b) The stock of domestic capital
(c) The volume of savings

One may wonder why there are still changes in the economy in the financial autarky state as 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 falls, for the
welfare state regime. The reason is that the pure market forces (indicated by the graph of when the welfare state
is shut off) are leading to capital imports. The welfare state reacts in the presence of such market pressures by
levying taxes and providing social benefits which curtail imports of capital for a range of values of 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 , until its
value is sufficiently low. At this point the welfare state gives in to the “market forces” , and capital start coming
in.
19

Note: For parameter values, see Appendix.
Figure 9 presents the rates of taxes and the volume of social benefits when the small open economy
imports capital from the rest of the world. When the skilled-rich form the majority, they choose
to impose no taxes on capital. They lower moderately the tax rate on labor as 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 falls. Interestingly,

when the unskilled-poor form the majority, they increase the tax on labor (though still this tax is
at a lower rate than when the skilled-rich form the majority), and lower sharply the tax on capital
once they depart from financial autarky and start to import capital. When the skilled-rich form the
majority the social benefit follows a similar pattern as the labor tax rate does (recall that they levy
no tax on capital): as 𝛿𝛿𝑘𝑘 falls, they lower moderately the volume of the social benefits.

7. Conclusion

Concerning trade DE globalization and the provision of social benefits, the main predictions of the
model depend on relative factor abundance. If the economy is relatively capital-abundant
compared to the rest of the world,

as the degree of trade globalization weakens and outward

capital flows recede, the provision of social benefit declines. In contrast, if the economy is
relatively labor-abundant economy compared to the rest of the world, as the degree of globalization
weakens and inward capital flows recede, the provision of social benefit rises.
