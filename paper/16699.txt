How Agricultural Biotechnology Boosts Food Supply and Accomodates Biofuels

NBER Working Paper No. 16699
January 2011
JEL No. Q1
ABSTRACT
Increased global demand for biofuels is placing increased pressure on agricultural systems at a time
when traditional sources of yield improvements have been mostly exhausted, generating concerns
about the future of food prices. This paper estimates the impact of global adoption of genetically engineered
(GE) seeds on food supply by exploiting the spatial and temporal variation in the adoption of GE crops
to identify the average yield effect due to GE technologies among adopters. The yield gains range
from 65% for GE cotton to 12.4% for soybeans and appear to be higher in the developing world than
in developed countries. The authors simulate food prices during the 2008 food crisis without GE-seed-induced
yield gains. Genetically engineered crops appear to play an important role in arbitrating tensions between
energy production, environmental protection, and global food supplies.

How Agricultural Biotechnology Boosts Food Supply
and Accomodates Biofuels
Steven Sexton and David Zilberman
August 1, 2010
Abstract
First-generation agricultural biotechnology is promoted as a tool to improve control
of agricultural pests that damage crops and reduce yields. A number of studies have
empirically tested the extent to which genetically engineered crops boost farm output
by reducing crop damage. They have been limited in size and scope and have generated
a wide-range of estimates that vary by country and crop. This paper exploits spatial
and temporal variation in the adoption agricultural biotechnology across countries in
order to estimate the impact of adoption on food supply. Genetically engineered crops
are shown to significantly increase yields on adopting farms at a time when demand for
farm output is growing dramatically and traditional sources of yield growth are largely
depleted. Econometric estimates are used to paramterize a simple multi-market model
to simulate the food price effects of GE seed during the food crisis in 2008. Food prices
would have been considerably higher absent the increased supply from agricultural
bitoechnology adoption. Demand for new farm land would have also been higher, as
would have been the consequent greenhouse gas emissions from land conversion.

Introduction

The global food crisis of 2008 ended three decades of declining food prices and highlighted
a growing challenge for agriculture: to supply food and clean energy to a world population
growing to 9 billion by 2050. In roughly the last half of the 20th century, agriculture accommodated a near doubling of the world population through intensification. Farm yields more
than doubled with the use of high-yielding seed varieties, agricultural chemicals, irrigation,
and mechanization. Per-capita calorie production grew despite the rapid population growth
and despite an exodus of land from production. Since the 1990s, however, yield growth in
staple crops has been slowing and stalling as traditional sources of yield improvements are
depleted. Absent intensification, demand growth will be met by extensification, which is
unpalatable amid growing concern about climate change and biodiversity loss.
First-generation agricultural biotechnology has been promoted as a tool for improving
the control of agricultural pests that diminish effective yields. To the extent adoption
of the technology generates yield growth, it constitutes a mechanism for expanding farm
output without expanding the area under cultivation. A number of studies in a variety of
countries have documented yield gains caused by the adoption of genetically engineered (GE)
crops. The studies have been limited in size and scope, however, and have generated widely
1

varying estimates of the yield gains from GE crop adoption. Absent agreement among
empiricists on the magnitude of yield improvements, agricultural biotechnology remains
controversial. Potential risks to human health and the environment are weighed heavily
against the uncertain benefits. This paper overcomes some of the limitations in earlier
empirical work in order to assess the degree to which the technology has increased food
supply on a global scale.

2.1

Background
Agricultural Biotechnology

Farmers around the world have rapidly adopted GE seeds since they were first commercialized in 1996. The GE seeds are intended to reduce pest damage and lower production
costs. By 2008, 13.3 million farmers in 25 countries annually planted 8% of global cropland to transgenic crops. In 2009, U.S. farmers planted more than 80% of the sugar beet
crop to transgenic varieties that had only been introduced one year earlier (James 2009).
Despite the popularity of agricultural biotechnology on the farm, its introduction in the
marketplace has met strong resistance from critics who advocate a precautionary approach
to the technology because of potential risks to humans and the environment. Consequently,
GE seeds and crops are banned in some countries and highly regulated in others, including
those that lead in adoption. The European Union, for instance, imposed a de facto ban on
GE seeds in 1998. The ban was lifted in 2008 amid pressure from the United States and the
World Trade Organization. Consumer sentiment against GE foods has also constrained the
market for GE seed. Products derived from GE seed have been relegated to feed and fiber
uses only. Producers must segregate GE crop output throughout the supply chain in order
to ensure the transgenic material is not comingled with conventionally bred crop output. In
early 2010, China was poised to approve the first use of a GE crops for human consumption.
Genetically engineered traits have been introduced to four principal crops: cotton, maize,
rapeseed, and soybean. Rapeseed and soybean seeds have been engineered to tolerate broadspectrum herbicides like glyphosates and gluphosinates, chemicals that target a host of
weed species and are lethal to conventional crops. Adoption of such herbicide-tolerant (HT)
varieties permits farmers to more effectively control weeds. Absent the HT trait, farmers
are forced to apply more toxic and narrowly targeted chemicals in order to kill weeds and
keep the crop safe. They also use mechanical control, like tilling operations, to control
weeds. Because glyphosates have historically sold at prices below the targeted chemicals,
adoption of HT varieties is likely to reduce damage control expenditures. Some cotton and
maize varieties have also been engineered with the HT trait, while others are engineered
to produce Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a naturally occurring toxin that is lethal if ingested
by a number of common insect pests. These are referred to as Bt crops or insect-resistant
(IR) crops. Some maize and cotton varieties are engineered to express both traits and are
commonly referred to as “stacked” varieties. HT traits have also been introduced into sugar
beets and alfalfa, though both are planted on a relatively small scale. Crops with HT traits
have always been the dominant GE crop, occupying 63% of total GE crop area in 2008,
followed by “stacked” traits (22%) and IR traits (15%). HT soybeans occupied the majority
of total GE-crop land (53%) and constituted 70% of the world soybean crop in 2008 (James
2009). GE maize constituted 30% of all GE crop area in 2008 and 24% of the world maize
2

crop.
Adoption of GE crops has been rapid. By 2009, half of all U.S. cropland was planted to
GE seed. Approximately 80% of the 2008 cotton, maize and soybean crops in the U.S. were
each produced from transgenic varieties. The U.S. has been a leader in adoption, planting
more than half (62.5 million hectares) of all GE area in 2008. But other countries have been
similarly aggressive in their adoption. South Africa, Australia and Argentina all planted
more than 90% of their 2008 cotton crops to GE varieties, up from 1-2% a decade earlier.
Canada planted virtually its entire maize crop to GE seed in 2008. Of the 25 countries
that planted GE crops in 2008, 15 were developed countries and 10 were developing (James
2009). Figure 1 shows the annual area planted to GE crops from 1996-2008 by country-type.

2.2

The Economics of Agricultural Biotechnology

There is a large and growing literature on the adoption and impact of GE crops. It is
summarized in Qaim [2009] and Council [2010]. Much of the literature on GE crop adoption
follows the threshold adoption framework of David [1969]. This framework assumes that
firms are heterogeneous, that they make choices that are consistent with an explicit economic
decision-making criterion (e.g. profit maximization), and that the costs and benefits of
technology adoption vary over time in response to changes in economic conditions and
learning (Feder et al. 1985). The threshold model is readily employed in applications with
data on the behavior of individual agents by using discrete and discrete-continuous choice
models.
Much of the literature on adoption of GE-crop technology estimated the factors that
affect whether producers adopt the technology and the extent of adoption. These studies
found that biophysical conditions (e.g. vulnerability to pest damage), economic conditions
(e.g. output and input prices), and regulatory conditions affect adoption. The scale of
operation and human capital are not major factors affecting adoption because GE-crop
technology is simpler than alternative damage-control mechanisms and does not exhibit
increasing returns to scale. Crost et al. [2007], however, did find evidence that farmers in
India with higher human capital were more likely to adopt.
Another significant body of literature has investigated the impact of GE-crop technology.
Most of this literature is surveyed in Qaim [2009] and Council [2010]. For the most part,
these studies compared the performance of GE with non-GE crops under various conditions.
Some conducted surveys of farmers to assess the reasons for adoption and the cause of yield
changes post-GE crop adoption. Most existing studies were conducted in the early days of
GE-crop adoption (from 1996-2003) or considered early data.
The potential gains associated with adoption of first-generation GE crops are several.
They include reduced crop losses from insect pests; reduced expenditures on damage control
inputs like herbicides, pesticides, and fuel; improved worker safety; greater flexibility in farm
management; and lower risk of yield variability Council [2010]. The magnitude of these
benefits varies by location, crop, and time. Table 1, which is borrowed from Qaim (2009),
summarizes existing empirical estimates of some of these benefits, including yield gains,
gross margin impacts, and pesticide use. It demonstrates the heterogeneity of estimates in
the extant literature.
There has been no rigorous assessment of the impact of adoption of GE technologies
in aggregate even though there is a rich literature on the welfare implications of adoption

based on stylized assumptions about shifts in supply. These studies, too, mostly cover
the earlier period of adoption of GE crops. The Council [2010] identified the lack of recent
market impact assessments as one of the major gaps in the economic research on agricultural
biotechnology. In this paper, we employ data on acreage of major crops and the share of land
for each crop that is allocated to biotechnology. We use analysis of variance to decompose
yield per acre to different components. Our analysis applies an approach introduced by Just
et al. [1990] to decompose variable input among crops. The approach is used to allocate
output among crop-types. We assume that at each time and location the yield per acre
of each crop with a given technology is fixed, but these yields per acre vary across crops,
technologies, and time. This approach has been generalized by Lence and Miller [1998] and
applied by Khanna and Zilberman [1999] to decompose aggregate data of energy generation
and GHG emissions in different locations. This rather simple approach allows us to rely upon
a minimal amount of data to decompose yields. We use our estimate of the partial effect of
GM adoption on yields of adopting farmers (a population averaged treatment effect on the
treated) to estimate the change in food supply attributable to agricultural biotechnology
and parameterize a model of the food market in 2008 in order to assess the effect of GE
seeds on food prices during the food crisis.

Conceptual Model

In this section, we present a conceptual model that provides the theoretical foundation for
the empirical analysis that follows in the next section. We adopt a modeling approach
that follows Qaim and Zilberman [2003] and Ameden et al. [2005] that employs the damage control framework of Lichtenberg and Zilberman [1986]. This framework distinguishes
between inputs that directly affect production, like capital and fertilizer, and inputs that
indirectly affect production by reducing crop damage, such as pesticides and mechanical and
biological control. Specifically, assume a constant-returns-to-scale agricultural production
function. Let yield per acre, y, be the product of potential output fj (z, a) and damage
abatement gi (x, N ). Potential output is the output that would obtain if there were no pest
damage. It is increasing in production inputs, z, like fertilizer, and a heterogeneity parameter a, which characterizes farm quality and is a function of climate, human capital, and
land quality. Potential output is also a function of seed variety, j, where j = 0 denotes a
generic seed variety and j = 1 denotes a local seed variety. It is assumed that for all z and
a, f1 (z, a) = f0 (z, a). Damage abatement is the share of crop not lost due to pest damage.
It is increasing at a decreasing rate in use of damage control inputs, x, like pesticides, and
decreasing in effective pest pressure, n. Effective pest pressure is the product of a seedtechnology parameter δi and initial pest pressure N , i.e. n = δi N , where δ0 = 1 denotes
conventional seed technology and δ1 < 1 denotes GE seed technology. Consequently, for all
x and all positive N , g1 (x, N ) = g0 (z, N ). Effective yield per acre under technology ij, then
is given by:
yij = gi (xij , N )fj (zij , a),
(1)
With this specification, farmers face at most four distinct seed technology packages: genericconventional (i = 0, j = 0), local-conventional (i = 0, j = 1), generic-GE (i = 1, j = 0), and
local-GE (i = 1, j = 1).

6

The farmer’s problem is:
maxz,x,i,j πij = pgi (xij , N )fj (zij , a) − wzij − vxij − Iij ,

(2)

where p, w, and v are exogenously determined prices for output, production inputs, and
damage control inputs, respectively, and where Iij is a technology fee associated with technology ij. It is assumed I00 < I01 < I10 < I11 .
Farmers adopt the technology that yields the highest expected profits. We solve the
farmer’s problem recursively. First, conditional on seed technology choice and farm quality
endowments, producers choose inputs to maximize profits. The profit maximizing quantity
of inputs given technology ij are functions of prices and land quality, such that:
x∗ij

= x∗ij (w, v, p, N )

∗
zij

∗
= zij
(w, v, p, N ).

Maximum profits under each technology are obtained by substituting the optimal input
demands into the profit function. Farmers select the technology that yields highest expected
profits conditional on profits being non-negative.
Analysis of these optimality conditions yields several results important for the subsequent
empirical analysis. First, the adoption of GE crops increases damage abatement, which
boosts effective yield under typical conditions. This is true so long as farmers face some
pest pressure and the adoption of GE crops does not require farmers to switch to a lowyield generic seed variety that would lower potential output. In theory, effective output
may decline with adoption of GE crops either because a given farmer must switch from
a local seed variety to a generic variety in order to adopt the GE technology or because
the insertion of the GE trait into the seed germplasm causes an interaction that reduces
potential output. In order for effective yield to decline with adoption, the percentage change
in potential output must exceed the percentage change in damage abatement in absolute
value. In practice, such reductions in effective output with GE adoption, termed “yield
drag,” have not been a significant problem (Council 2010). Furthermore, the optimizing
farmer would only choose to adopt GE seed that exhibited these yield drag effects and
thereby reduced total output if the cost savings from reduced damage control expenditures
exceeded the revenue loss from foregone yields.
Second, the damage-abatement gain is increasing in pest damage and the price of conventional damage control inputs like fertilizer. We can define the change in damage abatement
due to GE crop adoption, assuming no change in the j-dimension, as:
4g = g1j (x, N ) − g0j (x, N ).

(3)

d4g
Then it can be shown that d4g
dN > 0 and dw > 0.
Third, GE crop adoption causes an increase in the use of production inputs like fertilizer.
It boosts potential output as long as it does not require a switch from a local seed variety
to a generic seed variety. As damage abatement increases, so too does the value of marginal
product of production inputs increase, holding prices constant. Therefore, farmers employ
more production inputs. The increase in production inputs raises potential output, which
boosts effective output by more than the reduction in crop damage. Though we are unable
to test impacts of GE crop adoption on input-use in the subsequent empirical analysis due

7

to a lack of global data on input-use, this result suggests that the yield gain associated with
GE crop adoption exceeds the “gene effect” estimated in much of the previous literature.
Our empirical estimates of the yield gain associated with GE crop adoption incorporates
this additional yield effect that operates through the potential yield function as opposed to
the damage abatement function. This makes our yield estimates them unique among the
estimates of previous analyses.
Fourth, the change in yield due to GE crop adoption is increasing in farm quality, a,
and pest pressure, N. We can decompose the total change in effective yield due to GE crop
adoption as:
4y = y1j − y0j = f1j0 4g + 4fz g1j1 + 4fj g1j1 ,

(4)

where the first term on the RHS of the second equality is the damage abatement effect, the
second term is the production input effect and the third term is the yield drag effect, which
can be negative but is typically zero (i.e. if j0 = j1 or if j0 = 0 and j1 = 1). It is easy to
d4y
show, then, that d4y
da > 0 and dN > 0 . We do not observe α and N in our data, so to
the extent these theoretical predictions hold in practice, our empirical estimates of the yield
gain associated with GE crop adoption may be biased. Failure to control for farm quality
may induce an upward bias in the results. However, because the yield gains are expected to
be greater with high pest pressure and because high pest pressure may be associated with
low-quality farms, failure to control for pest pressure may induce an off-setting downward
bias in our results.

Data and Methods

The empirical strategy of this paper is motivated by the global pattern of GE seed adoption.
By 2008, farmers in 25 countries had planted at least one of the four major GE crops. In
most cases, the share of these crops planted to GE seed increased year over year in adopting
countries from 1996 to 2008. In the U.S., for instance, 12% of cotton was planted to GE seeds
in 1996, but by 2007 the GE share had reached 87%. Some countries adopted multiple GE
crops. Many others did not adopt any GE crops. Even some countries that are expected to
experience significant benefits from adoption have not adopted because of political economy
considerations. This was the case in European and African countries until 2010. Germany
and Romania had deregulated GE technologies, but then banned them for political reasons
unrelated to their performance on the farm. Countries that did adopt GE crops continued
to plant other crops exclusively to conventional seed either because GE alternatives did not
exist or because regulation banned some GE crops.
The variation in GE adoption across countries and across time enables the econometrician to control for confounding factors at the country level by employing a panel fixed effects
approach that relies on assumptions similar to, but weaker than, those required for estimation in triple differencing procedures. This procedure controls for endogeneity of adoption
at the country level, i.e. endogeneity of GE crop deregulation. However, estimation of a
population average effect of GE crop adoption is subject to the biases described at the end
of the preceding section, which stem from the endogeneity of adoption at the farm level, i.e.
selection on farm quality, which is unobservable in this data. These biases do not impede estimation of a population average effect of GE adoption among adopters, which is the critical

8

coefficient for estimating the increase in food supply attributable to GE technologies.
Motivated by Just et al. [1990], we observe that total output of crop j in country i at
time t, Qjit , is the sum of output produced by each seed technology, k. Thus
Qjit =

K
X

Qjitk ,

(5)

k=1

where Qjitk is the unobserved quantity of crop j produced by country i at time t using seed
technology k. Define Ljitk as the amount of land planted to crop j with seed technology k
in country i at time t. Then qjitk = Qjitk /Ljitk is the output of crop j per unit of land using
seed technology k in country i at time t. The deterministic component of the qjitk , which is
∗
denoted qjitk
, can be decomposed into a crop-specific average seed-technology effect, βjk , a
∗
crop specific time effect, γjt , and a country-specific crop effect, δji . Then qjitk
is given by:
∗
qjitk
= βjk + γjt + δji .

The βjk are of interest and can be estimated by
Qjit = δj Ljit + βj1 LGE
jit + γjt Djt + jit

(6)
(7)

where Ljit is total land planted to crop j in country i at time t, LGE
jit is the land planted to
GE seed for crop j in country i at time t, Djt is a crop-specific time dummy (the time dummy
for the year 2008 is omitted), andjit is a random deviation that is assumed normal and
identically distributed. Equation (7) is estimated using fixed effects to control for country
effects and secular trends. The fixed effects regression also controls for correlated random
trends (Wooldridge 2005). Results are reported with White robust standard errors. The δj
is the average yield on land that does not adopt GE seeds. The βj1 is the marginal effect
on yield attributable to adoption of GE seeds (k = 1 denotes GE seed technology).
Data on total crop output are reported in tonnes and come from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Total crop area is reported in hectares
by FAO. The area of land planted to GM crops and specific traits was developed by Graham Brookes using data from the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech
Applications (ISAAA). The data cover the period 1990-2008. We include data on every
country that adopted any GM crop from 1996-2008, as well as the top 100 gross producers
of eight principal row crops during the period 1990-2008. For these 100 countries, we include
observations on each of the four major GM crops (corn, cotton, soybean, and rapeseed) and
each of four other principal row crops: wheat, rice, sorghum, and oats. These data comprise
10,717 annual country-level observations on crop output and GM seed area covering 627
country-crop groups. Because not all countries planted all eight crops in every year, the
data constitute an unbalanced panel. Summary statistics are provided in Tables 2 and 3.

Empirical Results

In the first econometric analysis of the global yield effects of GE seed adoption, we find
that agricultural biotechnology generally produces significant yield improvements relative
to non-GE seed on adopting farms. Table 4 reports results from estimation of (7).1 In all

cases, the coefficients of interest, the βj , are statistically significant at the 99% level. Thus,
the partial effect of GM seed adoption among adopters is positive and significant. Row 1
of Table 7 reports the gain in yield from adoption of GE seed as a percent of total yield
per acre.2 The GE-seed effect on yields is greatest for crops with IR traits, i.e. maize and
cotton. Yield gains for GE cotton and maize–available in IR, HT and stacked varieties–are
estimated to be 65% and 45.6%, respectively. Yield gains for HT rapeseed and soybean
are 25.4% and 12.4%, respectively. These estimates reflect the theoretical prediction that
yield gains are larger for seeds expressing IR traits than for seeds expressing only HT traits
because the HT trait largely permits substitution to cheaper and less toxic chemicals. The
primary effect of HT seed, then, is to reduce the cost of damage control and lessen the
toxicity of chemicals applied to fields. As damage control becomes more cost effective,
however, increased damage control effort will be undertaken, which boosts effective yields
and may boost potential yield as well.
In order to test the theory that yield gains from GE crop adoption will be greatest in
regions that suffer high pest pressure and have diminished access to chemical pest control
agents, we estimate (7) separately for developed and developing countries. Because many
developing countries effectively employ chemical pest control agents and because pest pressure is expected to be greatest in tropical regions, categorizing countries by economic status
is admittedly crude. The development literature has struggled, however, to develop appropriate country classifications according to agro-ecological factors and doing so is beyond the
scope of this paper. Nevertheless, estimated yield effects from the separate regressions of
the developed and developing country samples does support the theory from Section 3. The
separate estimation of GE-seed effects for developed and developing countries are reported
in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. The magnitudes of these effects relative to conventional seed
effects are summarized in Rows 2 and 3 of Table 7. The estimated yield gains associated
with GE seed are greater in developing countries than in developed countries for each GE
crop. These differences are statistically significant at the 95% level.
We further estimate (7) with the addition of GM and non-GM time trends. These results
are reported in Table 8. We find a positive and significant trend associated with non-GM
crop yields for cotton, maize, rapeseed, rice and wheat. These correspond to 1.37%, 0.99%,
2.17%, 0.65%, and 1.16% annual growth from 1990-2008 for each of these crops, respectively.
GM cotton, rapeseed and soybean exibited statistically significant positive yield growth over
the same time period, suggesting that learning by doing and learning by using have fueled
yield growth that dominates declines caused by the pattern of adoption (i.e. expansion
of GE seed to farms that benefit less) and development of resistance to complimentary
chemicals. When the GM-seed trends are introduced, however, significance of the average
GE-seed effect is lost except in maize.
The foregoing results demonstrate that GE crop adoption generally has statistically and
economically significant effects on yields. As the threshold adoption model introduced in
Section 3 demonstrates, farmers select to adopt GE technologies based on their expected
gain. These gains are epected to increase in pest pressure and farm quality. Our estimates
do not control for the selection at the farm level. To the extent that GE crops are adopted
on farms of higher quality, these estimates will be upwardly biased estimates of the population average treatment effect (PATE). However, they represent unbiased estimates of the

population-average treatment effect of the treated (Imbens and Wooldridge 2009). These
estimates of yield gains among adopters are not inconsistent with some estimates in the
existing literature based on field trials that control for the farmer selection problem. Furthermore, unlike studies based on field trials, we have not endeavored to estimate a “gene”
effect, but rather the “GE-adoption” effect, which incorporates behavioral responses to GE
adoption, including the adoption of other technologies and farming practices and changes in
production input-use (e.g. fertilizer-use) that theory predicts will boost potential output.
The GE-adoption effect that we estimate should dominate the gene effect estimated in the
extant literature.
While the potential for upward bias of a PATE estimate is real, it should also be noted
that the upward bias traditionally associated with the endogeneity of technology adoption
should be somewhat minimized in this case for several reasons. First, the technology under
consideration serves to reduce the complexity of farming, suggesting that farmers with less
human capital may benefit the most from adoption. Second, while theory predicts the gains
increase in land quality, it also suggests the benefits of adoption will be greater where pest
pressure is higher. It is not clear this land will be of higher quality than land with less pest
pressure. It is quite possible that pest pressure is negatively correlated with land quality
such that the positive selection bias will be muted. Depending on the distribution of pest
pressure and quality, the selection bias could be negative. Third, GE seed is adopted on
marginal land that was not profitably farmed before the introduction of the technology.
This land expansion effect further diminishes the likelihood that the quality of farms that
adopt GE crops far exceeds the quality of farms that do not adopt.

Simulating impacts during the 2008 food crisis

In 2008, a global food crisis induced hunger and starvation in poor regions of the world
as prices for grains rose dramatically and major food producing countries slashed exports
to protect domestic markets. Food prices reached near-record levels in 2008, with some
commodity prices nearly doubling over just a few-year window and food indexes climbing
56% in one year. The dramatic run-up in food prices in 2008 coincided with record biofuel
production, so much of the blame for food insecurity was leveled at the diversion of harvest
from food to fuel uses.
Without the increased food supply afforded by agricultural biotechnology adoption,
prices would have climbed even higher. Using partial equilibrium analysis, it is possible
to consider what would have happened to food markets in 2008 if observed levels of biofuel production had prevailed and the additional output attributable to GE seed adoption
had not. To this end, we employ a multi-market framework to model the impacts of 2008
biofuel production on soybean, maize, wheat and rapeseed. We assume a global market for
commodities and simulate three separate assumptions on own and cross-price elasticities of
demand and supply. These scenarios are summarized in Table 9. Scenario 1 is characterized by reasonable elasticity assumptions based on estimated elasticities in the literature.
Scenario 2 is characterized by more elastic demand and Scenario 3 incorporates greater substitutability among crop supply. The supply attributable to GE crop adoption is determined
by multiplying the estimated GE yield gain by the area planted to GE crops for each crop.3

employ the developing and developed country estimates in the simulations.

We further parametrize the model based on observed prices and quantities in 2008. We then
consider the price effect of biofuel production by subtracting biofuel demand and finding
the new equilibrium price.
Global biofuel production in 2008 recruited 86 million tons (10%) of global maize production and 8.6 million tons of global vegetable oil, which we assume was equally drawn
from soybean and rapeseed production to constitute 7% of the global rapeseed harvest and
2% of the global soybean harvest. This increased demand for maize, soybean and rapeseed
increased prices 67%, 40%, 36% and 57% for maize, soybean, wheat, and rapeseed, respectively. As reported in Table 10, world prices for these for commodities would have been
between 26% and 40% lower without biofuel demand given the assumptions of Scenario 1.
Without the yield gains of global biotechnology production, 2008 prices would have been
considerably higher. Corn prices would have been 35% higher, soybean prices 43% higher,
wheat prices 27% higher, and rapeseed prices 33% higher.4 As is also shown in Table 10,
even under the assumptions of more elastic demand (Scenario 2) and supply substitutability
(Scenario 3), GE crop adoption in 2008 alone significantly reduced food prices. The cumulative effect of GE yield gains over the past 14 years is likely greater still, as inventories carried
into 2008 would have been larger, serving to dampen upward pressure on prices. Given the
degree of suffering that near-record-high commodity prices in 2008 induced among poor populations, it is likely that agricultural biotechnology adoption helped to avert starvation and
death. A more complete characterization of the welfare effects of biofuel and biotechnology
adoption is the subject of ongoing research.

Discussion and conclusions

In 2008, food riots and the doubling of commodity prices in some regions served as a reminder that with slowing agricultural productivity growth and growing demand for farm
output, the victory over hunger could only be ephemeral. Agricultural production must
grow in order to feed and fuel a global population that is at once increasing in size and
wealth. Because of growing concern about climate change and biodiversity loss, production
must expand without expanding into natural lands. This paper provides new econometric
analysis of aggregate farm yields that suggests that among adopting farms, agricultural
biotechnology boosts yields of the four main crops in which it has been introduced. Con4 An estimate of the global production gains attributable to biotechnology adoption was determined for
each maize, soybean and rapeseed by multiplying observed country-level production in 2008 by the countryappropriate estimate of the GM-induced percentage increase in yield and the country-crop-year specific
GM-crop share. These estimates determined GM-induced output gains to constitute 5%,11% and 4% of
total output for maize, soybean, and rapeseed, respectively.

sistent with the theory developed in this paper, we find that the yield gains are greatest in
developing countries, which are generally characterized by high pest pressure and limited
access to insecticides. We also show that the yield effect of GE crop adoption is growing
over time, suggesting that learning effects have dominated the effects of expansion into less
suitable applications and the development of resistance. This analysis, which points to the
capacity for agricultural biotechnology to drive productivity growth, is constrained by data
limitations that preclude controls for farm-level endogeneity of adoption. Consequently, our
estimates can conservatively be interpreted as a population average treatment effect on the
treated.
Simulation analysis based on the econometric estimation shows that, at the height of the
2008 global food crisis, the additional output generated by GE-crop yield gains mitigated
price increases, perhaps saving lives in poor countries. Absent the intensification permitted
by agricultural biotechnology, an additional 20 million hectares of land–an area equal in size
to the State of Utah–would have been required to produce the 2008 harvest of staple crops.
Such expansion of farmland would come at a cost in terms of greenhouse gas emissions (from
land conversion) and risk to biodiversity, especially if forests were cleared to accommodate
the additional crops. This analysis suggests that agricultural biotechnology constitutes a
tool to overcome challenges posed by macro trends at the outset of the 21st century. Firstgeneration GE crops permit the intensification of agriculture, which effectively frees land
for production of biofuel, or at least diminishes the demand for new cropland induced by
rising food and fuel needs.
