By focusing on subsidies that are paid only when the requirement is met, we show that a MAR can increase aggregate output relative to free trade provided that the right set of firms is targeted. In the context of a model with multiple Japanese and US firms, we show that a MAR on US imports is procompetitive as long as the US firms are the ones targeted to receive the subsidy.\n\n",
