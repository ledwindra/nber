An empirical model of hospital privileges for podiatrists is formulated based on the Pauly-Redisch model of hospital behavior. The privilege model is then incorporated into a model of podiatrists' earnings via a selection adjustment as proposed by Heckman and Lee. The results indicate the persistence of economic rents even after controlling for unobserved \"quality\" factors.\n\n",
