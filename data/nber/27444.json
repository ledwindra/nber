    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper identifies the impact of increasing post-childbirth work incentives on mothers\u2019 long-run careers. We exploit variation in work incentives across mothers based on the timing of a first birth and eligibility for the 1993 expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. Ten to nineteen years after a first birth, single mothers who were exposed to the expansion immediately after birth (\u201cearly\u201d), rather than 3\u20136 years later (\u201clate\u201d), have 0.62 more years of work experience and 4.2% higher earnings conditional on working. We show that higher earnings are primarily explained by improved wages due to greater work experience.\n\n",
