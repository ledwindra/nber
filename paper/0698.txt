TAXATION AND EXCESS BURDEN:

A LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE

ABSTRACT

A lifetime perspective is appropriate in assessing the welfare implications

of government tax policies. Although a number of attempts have been made to examine the excess burden of taxation in life-cycle models, these have tended to
ignore the role of human capital accumulation and/or the leisure—income choice.
In this paper, we do numerical simulations with a model that takes both of these
phenomena into account.
We find that under reasonable assumptions, the failure to take into.account
distortions of human capital decisions produces substantial underestimates of the

excess burden of income taxation. In addition, allowing for the endogeneity of
human capital increases the efficiency of a personal consumption tax relative to
that of an equal yield income tax.

INTRODUCTION

I.

Proper understanding of many important economic decisions requires

that.theybe viewed in a life cycle context. Similarly, such a perspec—
tiye.is appropriate in assessing the welfare implications of government

tax policies. Quite possibly, a tax that appears efficient from the
point of view of one year may be inefficient in a life cycle perspective
because of intertemporal allocation effects.

This important point was made several years ago by Levhari and
Sheshinski 119721 when they analyzed the excess burden of an income tax

in a model of lifetime utility maximization. However, as Levhari and
Sheshinski recognized, their model was characterized by several restric-

tive features: (a) Utility depended only upon the lifetime consumption
vector --

the

value of leisure was ignored;

(b) The elasticity of the

marginal utility of consumption was constrained to be unity; and (c)
There was no consideration of pre—tax wage determination; i.e., earnings
capacity was exogenous rather than generated by rational human capital

investment decisions. Even more recent models of tax policy in life cycle
models have tended to ignore the role of human capital accumulation.1
The payoff for such restrictive assumptions is that they allow the
derivation of an elegant analytic expression for excess burden. The
problem is that the substantial lack of "realism" precludes the possibility of producing numerical estimates of what the welfare costs of taxation

might actually be. An important purpose of this paper is to study via

simulations the impact of taxation in a model that allows for endogenous

leisure and human capital decisions. Our main focus is on how the lifetime excess burden of an income tax varies with key behavioral parameters.
However, the study also sheds light on such issues as the relative efficiency of income and consumption taxes, and the consequences of failing to
account for human investment decisions when considering the welfare costs
of taxation.

In Section II we describe the model of lifetime earnings and labor

supply, and explain how its parameters are set. The simulation results
are presented and discussed in Section III. A final section contains a

suggestions for future research.

II. THE MODEL

A.

Framework

Theoretical analysis of the individual's allocation o time over the
life cycle has been done by a number of investigators (see Blinder and

Weiss {1976], Heckman 11976] or Ryder, Stafford and Stephan 11975]). In
basic structure the models are quite similar. Each period the individual
divides his time between work, leisure and training (either at school or

on—the-job). Earnings capacity in a given period depends on past training,
i.e., the stock of human capital. Saving and borrowing can be done freely,
subject to the constraint that there be no outstanding debts at the end of

the life. All parameters of the model are known with certainty,2 and

are treated by Levhari and Weiss 11974] and Eaton and Rosen 119801.

capital

—3—

conditional on their values, the individual maximizes

a

utility function

which depends upon vectors of leisure, consumption, and possibly bequests.
Such models have been quite successful in reproducing the stylized

facts of observed life cycles: early specialization in formal schooling
followed by entry into the labor force, at first in a job with a relatively high proportion of on-the-job training and then, as time goes on, in

jobs involving little human capital investment. On the other hand, the
models cannot purport to be general equilibrium, because the gross rate of
return on capital is set exogenously.

Conceptually, the incorporation of taxes into the analysis is straight-

forward. Because individuals react to net rather than gross magnitudes, the
imposition of a proportional income tax leads to new effective wage and interest rates and hence to new optimal paths of leisure, consumption, savings

and human

capital.

3

In practice, the models are sufficiently complex that

the only way to generate useful comparative dynamics results is by means

of

simulations. (See Driffill [1977].)
Similarly, the computation of excess burden poses no serious conceptual

problems. Suppose that in the absence of taxation the individual's consump-

tion and leisure vectors are C0

respectively.

Then prior to

taxation, lifetime utility is

Excess burden is the diminution in utility in excess of that which would

B. Functional Forms
We could flesh out the general framework just discussed with any number

of models. One that is particularly well suited to our present purpose is
that of Blinder and Weiss (B-W) 119761. They postulate that the individual's

maximand

is additively separable over time with a constant discount rate.

The time endowment each

period is one, and time not spent on leisure is de-

voted to work and human capital accumulation h ,

(h =

l-L)

.

A

fraction x

of h is devoted to human capital accumulation. x can be thought of as an
index that rates jobs on. the basis of the proportional growth rate in human
capital that they allow. When x = 0 potential earnings are fully realiz,

ed; while x =

1

is associated with the maximum rate of growth: "pure

schooling." B—W assume that as x decreases, earnings increase less than
in proportion, because combining training and work on—the—job is not equivalent to dividing one's time between working and attending school. The

4mis differs slightly from the definition of excess burden used by
Diamond and McFadden [19741, who define it1as the compensating variation
the tax revenues colassociated with the change from u0

to u minus

lected along a compensated demand curve. As Diamond and McFadden as well

as a number of others have pointed out, the notion of excess burden is
consistent with a number of possible conceptual experiments. Our is
quite suitable for the purpose at hand. See Auerbach and Rosen [1980].

—5—

effective fraction of time spent on earning is therefore a function
g(x) ,

which B-W argue is likely to be characterized by g"(x) < 0

(p.453.)
The next important component of the model is the human capital

production function. The individual's stock of human capital, K(t)
is equivalent to his potential earnings. B-W assume that the percent-

age growth rate in K is proportional to the amount of time devoted
to human capital accumulation, hx ,

In order to make the Blinder-weiss model operational

is the length of life. This specification, of course, is far from general:
leisure and consumption are separable, the elasticity of the marginal utility of

consumption is constant, and a constant percentage rate of change of the marginal

utility of leisure is imposed. Unfortunately, allowing for non-separability
would render the problem virtually intractable. Utility function (3) is chosen
because it is tractable and yields interesting results. It is, incidentally,
considerably more general than others that have appeared earlier in this

literature.6 (See, for example, Levhari and Sheshinski [1979], who implicitly

The optimal paths for the variables in the general case are

described in detail by B—W.

A possible limitation of our model is its partial equilibrium nature.
Following Levhari and Sheshinski [1972], Feldstein [1978], Hec]Qnan [1976],

and many others, we assume that the pre—tax rate of return is invariant

with respect to changes in the tax system. As King [1980] and Fullerton,
Shoven and Whalley [1978] have pointed out, it might be more appropriate
to analyze broad based taxes in a general equilibrium framework. Given, our desire to concentrat9 upon the human capital and life cycle aspects of the
8
problem, such a course would appear to be computationally infeasible.

ince all variables in the model are in real terms, we are not able
to analyze the distortive effects of an unindexed tax system in the presence
of inflation.

Parameter Values
As noted above, for models of this complexity, the only way to obtain

interesting results on the efficiency effects of taxation is by means of

simulations based on specific parameter values. A number of attempts have
been made to estimate jointly the parameters of human capital models. (See,
e.g., Heckinan 11976] or Rosen 119761 . }

However,

serious econometric prob-

lems arise in the course of estimation, and the results cannot be viewed

with great confidence. Our strategy, therefore, is to piece together a
set of parameter values by appealing to empirical studies in various parts

of the literature. One of the advantages of a simulation methodology is
that the sensitivity of our substantive results to changes in the parameters
can be examined.

1. The Rate of Thterest.
The model assumes that the individual can borrow and lend at the s.me

interest rate. Historically, in the U.S. the average of long term real
before tax interest rates has been quite low. Brown 11976] and Feldstein
11973] have suggested a figure of 3 or 4 percent, about the growth rate of
real output. Interest rates inferred from optimal human capital accuinula—
tion models vary widely. Ben—Porath. 11970] found an implied interest rate
of about 20%, while Haley's 11974] estimate was between 5 and 8 percent, We
settle upon a valtie for r of 5%.

-92. Rate of
Estimating

Return to Education.

the return to education is

a well-established activity,

and the evidence indicates that the return depends on the level of education, assumptions concerning mortality, etc. (See the survey by

Psacharopoulos [1973].) We choose a conservative estimate of 5%. Note,
however, that in the simulations h is scaled so that its "normal" value
is one—half. Therefore, in order for a normal yearts work at school to
increase potential earnings by 5%, the value for a must be set at twice
that, i.e., 0.10.

3. Depreciation of Human

Capital.

Several estimates of the hmian capital depreciation rate are avail-

able. Heckman 11976] computed a figure of 3.7% for people with 13—16
years of education and 7% for people with 16 years of school. Haley 11976]

rates

found

in the region of 3—4%, and Mincer's 11974] estimate was

At the same time an individual ages, his human capital may be growin9 in

value due to economy-wide increases in productivity. In our models, 6

reflects

the net effects of depreciation and exogenous increases in prod-

uctivity. We settle upon a value of 6

of

—0.01, which is consistent with

(say) a 4% annual growth in productivity and a 3% reduction in potential
earnings due to aging.

These estimates are all generated by odels, in which.. gros.s human
capital accumulation is constrained to be positive throughout the lie—
time, and may he biased if there is a phase of pure work" during someof the lifetime.

— 10 —

4.

Length of Life.

It is assumed that the beginning of economic life occurs at the end
of compulsory education, and that differences in human capital accumulat—

cci to that point are exogenous to the model. We set T = 55, which might
be interpreted as the horizon of a plan made at age 15 by a person with a
life of 70 years.

5. Utility Functions.
The parameter E of equation (11 is the elasticity of the marginal
utility of income. As Maital 11976] has noted, a value of 1.5 crops up
often in the literature, and it is used in many of our simulations. We

choose B , the parameter that iuultiplies leisure in the utility function,
so that it is consistent with econometric results on the supply of labor.
More specifically, we take Kiefer's 11975] estimate of 0.181 for the fraction of a change in nonlabor income spent on leisure, and work backwards

from the first order conditions to find the implied value of B (condition-

al on a value of E =

1.5

).

This results in a value of B equal to

about 20.0.

The parameters a and W affect the relative preferences for consumption and leisure, and only their ratio matters. For each. simulation,
we set them so that a period of "pure schooling" of approximately three
years. occurs at the beginning of the individual's life.

6. Endowments.

(As noted above, the "normal"

would be working only half time.) The endowment of non-human

capital A , is set at zero.
7. Productivity of On-The-Job Training

No direct evidence on the productivity of on-the—job training as reflected in the parameter

of equation (2) is available. Therefore,

was chosen by experimenting with alternative values, and setting it with

reference to its effects on the simulated life—cycles. These experiments
showed that the principal effect of changing

was to alter the length

of the period of on-the-job training (OJT) in the model. Following a suggestion by l4incer 119741, we assume that OJT is completed at about age 47,

which is consistent with

-0.25.

8. The Rate of Time Preference.
Blinder and Weiss show that if p >

r

+ 6

an individual will "retire"

at the beginning of his life, if at all, whereas if p <

r+

6

,

an indi-

vidual may retire at the end of his life. The size of p also affects the
profiles of consumption and leisure over the individual's life. The rate
of growth of consumption is (r-p)/E .

During the schooling phase, hours

of non-leisure rise at a rate h = p/B

and during the working phase of life,

they fall if r + 6 - p > 0

since h = — (r+6—p)/B

A "stylized fact" of lifetime labor supply is that hours of ion—leisure ac-

tivity (h(t)) at first rise with age, reaching a peak in middle life, and then

fall somewhat. This suggests a value of p in the range 0 < P <

r

+ 6

— 12 —

It seems reasonable too that consumption should rise gently over the lifecycle, suggesting p <

r

.

Within

this range variations in the value of

p had small effects on the simulations, and a value of p = .01

was used.

III. SIMULATIONS

With specific functional forms and parameter values in hand, we can

compute the excess burden of any given tax system. The procedure is as
10

follows: Solve the model assuming no taxation, generating the optimal
pre—tax paths of hian capital accumulation, savings, consumption, leisure
and hence (by substituting into equation (3)) a value for lifetime util-

ity. Then solve the model with budget constraint (2') in order to find
post—tax utility u1

.

Next, find the utility level (u2) which results

when the present value of the income tax receipts is extracted from the

individual as a lump sum. Finally, compute the amount by which the non-

human wealth endowment, A , must be increased to raise utility from u1

to u2 .

This

amount is the excess burden of the tax.

In the process of doing these calculations, a good deal of interest-

ing comparative dynamics information is generated. For the sake of brevity,

10The solution of the model is obtained by a numerical method. The
solution is defined by differential equations describing the motion of the
state variables (assets A and human capital K ) and two co—state variables, and the initial conditions and transversality conditions on the
values of those variables. For any given set of initial values, the dif—
equations define a path and a set of terminal values. The numer—

Qf the parameters, individuals reduce leisure, increasing both
training and working. At the same time, the income tax reduces the effec—

(The

decrease in the interest rate increases the attractiveness of human capital
vis

vis physical capital as a vehicle for carrying consumption into the

future, ceteris paribus.)
We begin ou.r simulations by examining how excess burden iraries with

the income tax rate and with the behavioral parameters. In the next set,
lifetime excess burdens are computed on the assumption that human capital

accumulation is exogenous. Because this assumption is implicitly made in
most studies of the efficiency of taxation, it is of some interest to see

whether or not it leads to large differences in the estimates. Next, we

and stage of the life cycle, but tends to be substantial. Around the neighborhood of t =0 , when B=20 , and E=2.0 , the elasticity of lifetime human

is about -0.09 . In the absence of very much
econometric evidence on th long—run elasticity of human capital with respect
to its rate of return, it is hard to say whether or not this value is realistic
(although Willis and Rosen [1979] have found very large values for the elasticity of the probability of college attendance with respect to its return).
It is likely that a model with capital market constraints would lead to less
responsiveness, but this is beyond the scope of the present paper.

in this study, the elasticity of lifetime human capital accumulation with

calculate

excess burden on the assumption that leisure is not a choice

variable, which is close to the spirit of the Levhari-Shesh.inski model,

and leads us to the kind of results that might have been obtained if

they had attempted numerical solutions. Finally, we use the model to
compare the efficiency of income and consumption taxes, an exercise of
considerable interest given the current policy debate over the relative
merits of these two tax bases.

the excess burdens are con—

than those which have been generated in static models.

Analysis of static models has yielded ratios of excess burden to tax revenue under 5%.

(See Harberger 11964, p. 51] or Rosen 11978, p. 512].)

In contrast, Table I indicates a ratio of about 15% for low tax rates, and

about 80% for higher tax rates. This large discrepancy between the static

and

life-cycle

results suggests that ignoring the endogeneity of human

capital may lead to serious underestimates of excess burden.

2.

Excess Burden with Human Capital Fixed.

In light of point (c) above, it is important to know what the excess
burdens would have been if we had (mistakenly) assumed that human capital

investments are fixed exogenously. We consider the following experiment:
for

a given set of

behavioral parameters, and assuming no taxes, generate

the. optimal lire cycle plan as before. Now impose a proportional income
tax, :but constrain the growth of human capital investment to be exactly

the ame as it was in the pre—tax situation. Taxes, then, can distort the
leisure—income tradeoff daring a given period as well as interteiuporal con—
surnption decisions, but they haye no effect on human capital.

The outcome of this experiment is shown in Table II. Compared to
Table I, the most striking aspect is the dra.iatic fall in the ratio of ex—

cess burden to tax revenues. The figures. are now n the order of 2 to 3%

for low tax rates, and 10 or 15% or higher tax rates. Thus, as conjectured aboye, the failure to consider human capital accumulation generates sub-

stantial downward errors in excess burden calculations. Itis also noteworthy that thi faIlure leads to overestimates of tax revenues.

The reason for this overestimate is related to the fact, noted above,

that the income tax leads to expansion of human capital. The increase in
human capital delays the individual's earnings and increases the value of

his debts. Both of these effects reduce the present value of tax revenue
relative to what it would have been had human capital been fixed, and they

more than offset the revenue effects of the tax—induced increases in earnings capacity.

3.

Excess Burden with Fixed Labor Supply
It is often assumed in human capital models that the individual's goal

is income maximization rather than utility maximation. In the next set of
simulations, we investigate the errors that might be induced when the leisure—

income tradeoff is not taken into account. To do so, we first compute the
optimal lifetime plan in the absence of taxation. We then recompute the plan
including taxes, but constraining the values of leisure to their pre—tax
values, although human capital decisions are still endogenous.

The results are shown in Table III. Compared to Table I, there are
smaller excess burdens, but the differences are not as dramatic as those in

Table II. Failing to consider the distortionary effects of taxes on the
leisure-income choice does not lead to as much of an error as ignoring the

endogeneity of human capital. This perhaps suggests that more effort should
be devoted to estimating the effects of taxes on human capital accumulation,
and less to refining estimates of the elasticity of hours of work with respect to the tax rate.

Income Versus Consumption Taxation

A major debate in public finance concns the merits of consumption
versus income taxation. An important issue is the relative efficiencies
of the two tax bases.
following:

In order to investigate this matter, we did the

(i) For a given income tax rate, compute lifetime tax revenues

and excess burden as before.

(ii) Find the consumption tax rate (te of

equation (")) that generates the same present value of tax revenues.

(iii)

Compute the excess burden associated with the consumption tax, and examine
its ratio to that of the income tax.

Before presenting these results, it should be emphasized that although
our utility function (3) is separable in consumption and leisure, it is not

homothetic in leisure. If homotheticity obtained, then a consumption tax
would be more efficient than an income tax, independent of the parameter values

chosen. Given (3), however, it cannot be known a priori which tax is more efficient.

The

income tax is 0.05, then the excess burden of a consumption tax is 2.1% of
the excess burden of an equal yield income tax.) The figures suggest that
for all parameter values, the consumption tax is considerably more efficient
than the income tax, and that the relative efficiency is an increasing function of the income tax rate.

Because consumption taxation is often analyzed using models which ig-

nore human capital, it is of some interest to see how these results would

have changed if we had assumed exogenous human capital accumulation. The
outcomes are shown in the last three columns of Table IV. A glance at these

they are larger than their counterparts in the first half of the table.

Thus, failure to take human capital into account would bias downwards one's
estimate of the efficiency gains achievable by moving from an income tax to

a consumption tax.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Most attempts to analyze the excess burden of taxation have relied on

static models. A few studies have viewed excess burden in a dynamic context but these have ignored the potentially important role of human

capital accumulation. In this paper, we have used simulations to analyze
a more general model which explicitly allows or endogenous human capital
decisions.

Our results suggest that conventional measures of excess burden seriously understate the true' éfficienOy losses of taxation. This outcome

occurs despite the fact that we impose on the model a rather conservative
