REAl WAGES AND THE TERMS OF TRADE:
ALTERNATIVE INDEXATION RULES FOR AN OPEN ECONOMY

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the desirability of wage indexation in an
open

economy subject to economic disturbances which

of trade and raise the prices of

change the terms

imported goods. Two indexation rules

are considered, the traditional form of indexation to the consumer
price index and indexation to the price of

domestic goods alone, the

latter proposed as a means of limiting the influence of import prices

on the economy. The effects of the rules are shown to depend upon how
the terms of trade rather than

import prices alone respond to dis-

turbances, since changes in the terms of trade determine what adjustments
are required in the two real wages faced by firms and labor.

Wage indexation attempts to fix real wages throughout the length of labor

contracts regardless of the source of price fluctuations. Many of the
economic disturbances experienced recently in industrial countries have called
for changes in real wages, especially those disturbances altering the terms of

trade between domestic and foreign goods, This paper examines the
desirability of indexation when such changes in the terms of trade occur.
There are two real wages in an open economy producing a product

differentiated from those abroad: the nominal wage deflated by the price of
the domestic good and by a price index composed of domestic and foreign

goods. The producer responds to one real wage, while labor responds to the
other.' When the terms of trade change, these two real wages diverge, so that
fixing one real wage through indexation still allows the other real wage to

vary. The paper will examine the effects of this interplay between the two
real wages, since it is a key

feature

in the macroeconomic adjustment to

economic disturbances.
One suggestion commonly made is to limit wage indexation agreements to
domestic prices alone by tying wages to the GM' deflator rather than the

consumer price index.2 The proposal is attractive to many observers because
it apparently offers a way of shielding the domestic economy from increases in
the prices of imports, whether due to increases in foreign prices or the

depreciation of the domestic currency. The paper will examine under what
conditions this form of indexation is preferable to the traditional form of

indexation to consumer prices. The choice of indexation rule will depend less
upon how import prices change than upon how the terms of trade are affected by
disturbances.
Most previous studies of optimal wage indexation, including those of Gray
(1976) and Fischer (1977b), have confined their analyses to closed

—2--

economies.3 The basic conclusions about indexation in such economies can be
summarized as follows: monetary or aggregate demand disturbances call for
full wage indexation since fixing real wages prevents output from

fluctuating. Only aggregate supply disturbances call for less than full
indexation, essentially because the adjustment of the real wage helps to

moderate output movements. This paper shows why these propositions must be
modified in an open economy.
Indexation is analyzed in the context of a small open economy subject to

a variety of disturbances, all of which share a common feature: these
disturbances ordinarily result in a rise in the domestic price of imports.
Otherwise they are very different in nature, as their descriptions indicate:

(1) an increase in the foreign money supply which raises the price of foreign
goods;

(2) an increase in the domestic money supply;
(3) a reduction in demand for the domestic good; and
(4) a fall in productivity in the domestic industry.
The first disturbance is assumed to occur under fixed exchange rates, since
foreign prices have their greatest impact in that regime, while all the

remaining disturbances are analyzed under flexible rates. Each will be
described more fully later in the paper.

I. DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL
The domestic country trades with the rest of the world but is assumed to

be too small to affect foreign output, prices, or interest rates. It produces
a good which is an imperfect substitute for foreign goods, but consumes both

domestic and foreign goods. Pt is the price of the domestic good, X is the
exchange rate and p is the foreign currency price of the foreign good.
(These and other variables are expressed in logs; a list of variables is

—3--

provided in an appendix). The consumer

price index, I, and the terms of

trade, Tt, are defined as functions of these prices:
= aP

4- (l—a)(X ÷ P)

(x + P)
The consumer price index is a weighted average of domestic and
foreign prices
expressed in domestic currency, while the

terms of trade measures the price of

the domestic good relative to that of the foreign good.
The model of the domestic country consists of three equations,
supply and demand for the domestic good and

aggregate

an equation describing financial

behavior. In order to explain the impact of indexation on supply behavior,
we
begin with a model of aggregate supply in

a frictionless economy without

contract lags or indexation,

A. Supply Behavior in a Frictionless Economy
The terms of trade affect

aggregate supply even in an economy without

contract lags because producers and labor respond to different real wages. The
real wage facing the producer is defined relative to the domestic price, whIle
the real wage that is relevant for labor is defined relative to the
consumer

price index. The model of supply behavior specified below shows how domestic
output is affected by the relative movements of these two real wages. (All
variables in this frictionless economy are starred).

The model consists of a Cobb-Douglas production function (equation la), a
labor demand function derived from the production function (equation ib), and

a labor supply function (ic). The production function includes a disturbance

the model introduced below). Notice that the producers real wage appears in
the labor demand function, while 1abors real wage appirs in the supply
function.

Solving this model results in the aggregate supply equation (1)*. Output
is a function of the terms of trade as well as the productivity disturbance.

How the terms of trade affect output can be illustrated by Figure 1 which
shows how the nominal wage and employment are determined.
Consider first the effects of an equal rise in domestic and foreign
prices which keeps the terms of trade constant.

The price changes are defined relative to prices in a stationary

where all disturbances are equal to zero. As will

be seen below, this change in prices could be due to (1) an unanticipated
increase in the foreign money supply under

fixed exchange rates which induces

a rise in the price of the foreign good, or (2) an unanticipated increase in
the domestic money supply under flexible exchange

shifting up to point b. Labor
employed and therefore output remain constant
since the nominal, wage rises as much as prices, thus

constant .4

Now consider a case where the

foreign exchange rate, and therefore the

domestic currency price of the foreign good, rises more than the
domestic
price so that the terms of trade
fall. (For simplicity, the price of the
foreign good in foreign currency is assumed to remain
constant.) This price
behavior could be due to a shift
in demand away from the domestic good under
flexible rates:

0< P-'F< I—T< x —L
These price changes induce a fall in the
amount of labor employed and output.
The labor supply curve shifts up by the change in the consumer price
index
(to L), while the labor demand
curve shifts up by the change in the domestic
price (to L ). Labor employed must fall (to c). Both real
wages change:
the real wage faced by the producer must rise while the real
wage earned by
labor must fall.
In equations (id) and (le) below we express the two real
wages as
functions of the terms of trade

and the supply disturbance (the latter of

which we assume equal to zero for purposes of the present discussion).

If labor supply is

then the change in the terms of trade has no

effect upon the producer's real wage and therefore upon output in this

frictionless economy. Alternatively, if labor supply is infinitely elastic
(n =

), then

labor's real wage remains constant. But in the general case,

changes in the terms of trade call for changes in both real wages. That will
pose problems in an economy with contract lags and Indexation if indexation
holds one or the other real wages constant.

B. Supply Behavior in an Economy with Contract Lags
When there are lags in labor contracts, current wages do not generally
reflect current prices unless there is some type of indexation. The model
specified below assumes that there is a one period contract lag so that wages

contracted for period t, W, reflect labor market conditions expected as of

period t1.5 (See equation if).

The model allows for two alternative types of indexation: consumer price
indexation, where wages are tied to the general price level, and domestic
price indexation, where wages are tied to the price of domestic output

alone. If there is consumer price

indexation, current wages are adjusted by a

fraction b of the difference between

If there is domestic price

a fraction b' of the difference between

indexation, the adjustment is by

current and expected producer prices

(See equation ig). The indexing parameters, b and b', are

assumed to lie in the range between zero indexation (b =
indexatjon (with either b =

or b' =

1).
output produced depends upon the actual

wage, W, and the domestic price, Equation (1), the supply equation for
domestic output, is obtained by substituting the actual wage from equation
(ig) into the non—starred equivalent of the labor demand function (ib), and
substituting the latter into the non—starred equivalent of the production

function (la).7 The result is a formidable—looking supply equation that
expresses output as a function of two price prediction errors as well as the

supply disturbance. As in a closed economy (where a =

1),

output is

positively related to unanticipated changes in the price of domestic output.
But output is also positively related to unanticipated changes in the terms of
trade if wages are indexed at all to the consumer price index (i.e., b > 0),
since then wages and therefore output

respond to unanticipated changes in both

domestic and foreign prices.
Before closing the model with aggregate demand and financial equations,
we can use equation (1) to review some of the results of the domestic
indexatiori literature (where a =

1).

—8--

(1) If there are monetary disturbances or aggregate demand

disturbances in a closed economy, then output changes in
proportion to the rcsulting unanticipated change in prices:
—

However, if there is full indexation, which can be

represented by either b=1 or b'=l since the price of domestic
output and the consumer price index are identical in this simple
closed economy, then output is shielded from this disturbance.
(2)

If there are supply disturbances, such as a fall in

productivity, u < 0, then output is affected both directly

(proportionally to u) and indirectly (through the resulting
unanticipated rise in the domestic price.). With full indexation,
the change in output is even larger, since Indexation prevents the
rise in the domestic price from dampening the direct effect of the
disturbance on output. Thus indexation increases the effect of the
disturbance on output.
Both of these results are modified by the introduction of foreign goods and
the terms of trade into the economy.

C. Closing the model
Aggregate demand is assumed to be a function of the terms of trade, the
real interest rate, and a stochastic disturbance,

A rise in the terms of trade (rise in the domestic price relative to the
foreign price) is assumed to reduce aggregate demand, as is a rise in the real

interest rate. In the case of perfect substitution between foreign and
domestic goods, where g becomes infinite in size, this aggregate demand
relationship reduces to the familiar purchasing power parity relationship.

The domestic bond IS assumed to be a perfect substitute

for the foreign bond,

so the domestic interest rate is equal to the expected return

bond. (Equation 3a). Under flexible exchange
rates, the supply of money Is
assumed to be equal to a base level plus a random disturbance

exchange rates, the supply of money is determined
endogenously by equation (3).

disturbance, but so does indexatioti to the consumer

price index. Neither type

of indexation, on the other hand, shields the

—11—

domestic wage or price from the disturbance.
Consider indexation to the consumer price level first. Full indexation
(b=1, b'=O) ensures that the rise in the

price of the foreign good is fully

transmitted to the domestic wage; the price of the domestic good, in turn,
rises in proportion to the wage. As a result, the domestic price rises as
much as the foreign price:

Ptppf_umf/(l÷k)
Thus with full indexatlon, the terms of trade remain constant, and so also

does domestic output. It is because the

domestic wage and price adjust fully

to the disturbance that the terms of trade and domestic output can be shielded
from the disturbance.
Indexation to the domestic price alone (b'=l, b=O) has the same effects
on the economy as indexation to the consumer price level since with the terms

of trade constant it cannot matter which type of indexation is employed. To
see why this is true, consider the following relationship between the two real
wages:

W —

As long as the terms of trade are constant, fixing
one real wage through
indexation also fixes the other real wage. So the two types of indexation are
equivalent, with both types insulating domestic output completely from the
disturbance.
Under flexible exchange rates, the foreign monetary disturbance leads to

an appreciation of the domestic currency. The

appreciation

completely

insulates all domestic variables from the disturbance, a familiar result for
this type of disturbance, so the degree of indexation is irrelevant.8

—12--

B. Domestic Monetary Disturbance under Flexible Rates
This disturbance affects the domestic economy much like the previous

disturbance since an increase in the domestic money supply under the flexible
rates leads to a depreciation of the domestic currency and a rise in the

domestic currency price of the foreign good. In the absence of indexation,
domestic output and the price of that output both increase in response to the

depreciation. But if wages are fully indexed, whether to the consumer price
index or the domestic price alone, then the rise in the domestic price is
equal to the change in the exchange rate:

= (Xt

— •5) =

u'/(1+k1)

Since the terms of trade are constant, indexation insulates domestic output
just as in the case of the foreign monetary disturbance.
We note that under fixed exchange rates, the assumption of perfect
capital mobility ensures that domestic output and price are completely
insulated from the disturbance (regardless of the degree of indexation),
another common result in the literature on exchange rate regimes.

disturbances to be considered, however, since both disturbances have real

—13--

Before considering these disturbances, we must discuss the proper

criterion for judging indexation since an ambiguity arises in the case of

these disturbances. We might judge indexation according to whether or not it
minimized the effects of disturbances on domestic output, a traditional
objective of economic policy. Gray (1976), however, proposed an alternative

criterion: the stabilization of output relative to that prevailing in a
frictionless economy without contract lags. In our notation, the criterion
involves minimizing the value of the loss function, Z, which is expressed in

terms of deviations of actual Y from output in an economy without contract

lags, Y:
Z =

E[(Y

—

The rationale for this criterion lies in the inefficiencies
associated with
being off labor demand and supply curves because of contract lags. This
criterion is the proper one if the fundamental objective of indexation is to

undo the distortions caused by contract lags. In a closed economy, the two
criterion differ whenever there are supply disturbances, since output in a

frictionless economy is not then constant. In an open economy, the two
criteria also differ for any disturbance that changes the terms of trade

since y* is a function of the terms of trade.9 The two criteria were
identical for the two monetary disturbances considered above since neither

disturbance affects Y. But the two criteria will differ for both of the
disturbances considered below.
The two remaining disturbances to be considered are as follows: a
reduction in the demand for the domestic good and a fall in productivity in
the domestic industry, both under flexible exchange rates. Since the terms of
trade are central to the discussion, we solve the domestic model (equations

—14-S

disturbances:

These expressions are obtained by solving equation (i)* and the starred
equivalents of equations (2) and (3).

A. Aggregate Demand Disturbance
If there is an unanticipated fall in the demand for the home good

(u < 0), then in the frictionless economy without contract lags domestic
output and the terms of trade fall. (See equations (7)* and (8)*). Because
the terms of trade change, the economy behaves differently under the two types
of indexation:
Consumer Price Indexation (b=1)
Output and the terms of trade still fall if wages are fully indexed to
consumer prices:

Indexing to the consumer price index ensures that labor's real wage remains

constant. But because the ternis of trade change, the real wage facing

producers cannot also remain constant. And it is the producer's real wage
which determines the behavior of output. Recall the relationship between the

= (Wt —

two real wages: W —

—

(1-.-a)T.

With the terms of trade

falling, the producer's real wage must rise. Thus output must fall even with
complete indexatlon.

Domestic Price Indexation (b'=l)
This type of indexation keeps the producer's real wage constant, so
output itself remains constant despite a fall in the terms of trade:

Because the producer's real wage cannot adjust, the terms of trade must absorb
the full impact of the disturbance, falling enough to keep aggregate demand

constant. Thus output and employment are shielded from the disturbance. If
the objective of indexation is to keep output constant, then domestic price
indexation is optimal.

If instead, the objective of indexation is to minimize deviations from
output in an economy without contract lags, then neither type of indexation is

optimal. Consumer price indexation induces output to fall more than it would

—16—

in a frictionless economy, while domestic price indexation prevents output
from falling at all.

b=1

t 'b'=1 =

The reason should be clear from the discussion of behavior in the frictionless

economy in Section I. This type of disturbance calls for a rise in the
producer's real wage and a fall in labor's real wage. (See equations (Id) and
(le)). If labor resists the fall in its real wage by adopting consumer price
indexation, output falls even more than in an economy without contract lags.
[f the wage is indexed to the domestic price, in contrast, the producer's real

wage cannot rise and so no real adjustments take place. Each type of
indexation leads to deviations from the frictionless norm, one causing an
excessive reduction in output, the other preventing any real adjustment at
all.

Only in polar cases does either type of indexation lead to output

variation equal to that in an economy without contract lags. If labor supply
is inelastic (ri =

0),

then as discussed in Section I, output remains constant

in the economy without contract lags, so domestic price indexation is

optimal. (Notice that the two criteria merge in this case.) Alternatively,
if labor supply is infinitely elastic (n =

a'), then

labor's real wage remains

constant in the frictionless economy; so indexing to the consumer price index

must result in the same output behavior as in the frictionless economy)0 But
otherwise, both types of indexation are suboptimal (measured relative to
behavior in the frictionless economy).
In the general case where neither form of indexation is optimal, we might
choose between the two indexation schemes according to which more closely
approximates behavior in the economy without contract lags.

It should be

In general, partial indexation is

called for, unlike the case of a closed economy.

We can summarize the discussion

of the decline in demand for the domestic

good as follows:

(1) Domestic price indexation

can stabilize output completely iii the presence

of this disturbance, while unlike In a closed economy consumer
price
indexation allows output to fall.
(2)

If the policy objective is to minimize deviations from
output in an

economy without contract lags, neither form of indexation is generally
optimal, although domestic price indexation

is still preferred as long as the

labor supply elasticity is relatively low.

(3) If consumer price indexation is

retained, the optimal indexatjon

parameter is generally less than one, again in contrast with the case of a
closed economy.

—18—

B. Aggregate Supply Disturbance
The supply disturbance to be considered is a decline in productivity

(u < 0). This disturbance lowers domestic output in the frictionlss
economy, but raises the terms of trade as well as the price of domestic
output. (See equations (7)* and (8)*).

The decline in productivity has an

indeterminate effect on the exchange rate; with domestic output falling but
the price of that output rising, the transactions

demand for money can either

fall or rise. Even if the domestic currency depreciates, however, the
exchange rate still rises less than the price of domestic output, o the terms

of trade must rise. The general price level, moreover,

also rises less than

the domestic price (and may actually fall) because 1 is just a weighted
average of the prices of the two goods.

With the terms of trade rising, the two real wages respond differently to
the disturbance.

decline just as in a closed economy. Labor's

real wage never falls as much as

the producer's real wage because the rise in the terms of trade moderates that

fall by opening a wedge between P and I.

In fact, as equation (le)'

suggests, labor's real wage can actually rise in response to this disturbance
if, for example, the domestic currency

appreciates enough to lower the general

price level. But a rise in that real wage can be ruled out as long as the
elasticity of aggregate demand with respect

to the terms of trade exceeds a

indexation is employed. We begin

depends crucially upon which type of

by describing domestic price indexation:

Domestic Price Indexation (b'=i)
In the case of a productivity

disturbance, keeping the producer's real

wage fixed does not keep output fixed since the

disturbance directly affects

output. With full indexation, output falls and the terms of trade rise by:

Because the producer's real wage is prevented from falling, in fact,
output

variation is greater with domestic price indexation than in the
economy

without contract lags. Adjustment of the real wage in the frictionless
economy helps to minimize the effects of the disturbance

on output, while

indexatjon prevents that adjustment.
Consumer Price Indexation (b=i)
In the case of consumer price

indexation, output still falls, and the

terms of trade rise:

Choosing this form of indexation, however, always results in less output
variation than when domestic price indexation

is adopted. (Compare (11) and

—20—

(11)'). The reason is clear from examining the relationship between the two

real wages and the terms oi trade: W —

By fixing

labor's real wage, consumer price indexation still allows the producers real
the real
wage to fall since the terms of trade rise. With some adjustment in

wage facing them, producers

reduce output less than when wages are tied to

domestic prices. So the decline in output is smaller in absolute terms under
consumer price indexation than under domestic price indexatiori.

Yet how does output variation under conser

price indexatioti compare

with that in the frictionleSS economy? Once again,
answer most easily by examining

we can determine ttle

the real wage in the frictionlesS ecoromy

(le)'. In the absence of contract lags, labor's real wage declines when
productivity falls as long as the

elasticity condition if fulfilled. When
of wages to the consumer price index,

there are contract lags and indexation

this real wage is preventezl from falling.

Thus output falls more with

consumer price indexation than in the frictionlesS economy, the same result
found in a closed economy.15
It is evident from the preceding

that of the two forms of indexation

domestic price indexation leads to greater variation in output both in
absolute terms and relative to output in the frictionless economy since

That is, the indexation parameter that keeps output equal to that in a

frictionless economy is less than one.17
We can summarize this discussion of the decline in productivity as
follows:

(1) Neither type of indexation can keep output constant because the
productivity disturbance directly affects output.

(2) Domestic price indexation results in greater output variation than
consumer price indexation both in absolute terms and relative to output
variation in an economy without contract lags.

(3) If some form of consumer price indexation is adopted, the optimal
indexation parameter is generally less than one, just as in a closed
economy.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
The relationship between the terms of trade and real wages provides the
key to understanding the effects of wage indexation in an open economy. All
of the disturbances considered above raise the domestic price of imported
goods, but the desirability of indexation differs according to how the terms
of trade rather than the import price itself responds to the disturbance.
Of the two forms of indexation studied, domestic price indexation shows
advantages over consumer price indexation only in the case of aggregate demand

• disturbances. A decline in demand for the domestic good leads to a fall in
the terms of trade; stabilizing labor's real wage through consumer price
indexation still allows the producer's real wage, and therefore output, to
vary when the terms of trade fall, whereas domestic price indexation

stabilizes output completely. For aggregate supply disturbances, on the other

—22—

hand, domestic price indexation leads to greater variation of domestic output

both in absolute terms and relative to output in a frictionless economy. For
disturbances which leave the terms of trade unchanged, moreover, it does not
matter which indexation rule is chosen since fixing one real wage also fixes

the other. This is the case for monetary disturbances, including foreign
monetary disturbances which raise the price of foreign goods. Thus only
limited support is found for delibrately excluding foreign prices from wage
indexat ion schemes.

For the more traditional form of wage

indexation——indeXation to the

consumer price index—the analysis confirms some of the results found in a
closed economy, but modifies others. The chief

difference arises in the case

of aggregate demand disturbances. Full indexation prevents labor's real wage
from adjusting to the terms of trade. Only with partial indexation does
output vary as it would in the economy without contract lags.

'For

previous analyses of the labor market emphasizing this difference

between the two real wages, see Salop

(1974), Purvis (1979), Sachs (1980),

Flood and Marion (1982), and Marston (1982).
2Countrjes where such proposals have been debated include Denmark,

Israel, and the United Kingdom. See, for example, the study of wage
indexation by Braun (1976). Israel opted instead for a partial (70%)
adjustment to the CPI which was meant to exclude on an average basis only
those increases in the CPI due to rises in import prices or indirect taxes.
For a discussion, see the Bank of Israel (1975),

Recently the Congressional

Budget Office (1981) has compared a variety of Indexation rules for the United
States including tying wages and federal benefits to the CNP deflator
specifically to exclude import prices.
3An important exception is the recent study by Flood and Marion (1982) of

optimal indexation in an open economy. For most of their study they assume
that there is a single world good so that the law of one price holds, whereas
here changes in the terms of trade are central to the analysis. Where the
results are similar is in the case of a

productivity disturbance, since they

show how their results are modified for this disturbance when the domestic and

foreign goods are distinct. See the discussion of the

productivity

disturbance below.

4Output changes are directly proportional to employment changes as long

as there are no supply disturbances. (See equation la).
5This contracting approach to the aggregate supply function has been

criticized by Barro (1977) who offers an alternative description of labor
market behavior which gives Pareto optimal outcomes. Barro develops a model
where wages are set in contracts but where employment is kept at its Pareto

—24—

optimal level at all times. Such contracts dominate the simple ones
considered here, but raise problems of moral hazard because of the contingent
contracts required, as Barro himself recognizes, and seem to be very different
from actual labor contracts, as Fischer (1977a) observed in his comment on
Barro's paper.

t_IE 1 is the expected value of the general price level at period t

based on information available at period t—1. The expectation, like others in
the model, is assumed to be formed rationally on the basis of behavior in the
model.

7Cukierman (1980) shows that the effects of indexation are sometimes
changed if employment is determined by labor supply rather than labor demand.
Although the employment rule deserves further study, we have chosen not to
further complicate our analysis with alternative rules.
81f the foreign country were less than fully indexed, however, flexible
rates would not insulate the economy from a foreign monetary disturbance. See
Marston (1982) for a discussion of this case.

The disturbance would raise

foreign output which would affect domestic aggregate demand much like the
aggregate demand disturbance to be discussed below.
9When the terms of trade can change, real income is not equivalent to

real output. We might alternatively specify

The criterion would be expressed in terms of

the deviation of actual real income from real income in an economy without
contract lags as follows:

This expression, however, can be simplified so that only output appears in the

25
loss function. (Flood and Marion (1982) make a similar point). If we take
the aggregate demand function (2) and

subtract its (starred) equivalent in the

frictionless economy for the case where all foreign variables are constant, we
obtain:

y

The objective then simplifies to

real output carry through for real income except in the special case where

In that case, real income is always identical in the economies

with and without contract lags, with the deviation In output exactly
offsetting the deviation in the terms of trade.

economy changes by

as in a closed economy. We assume that the

denominator in the expression above is positive which is the case even for

n = 0 (i.e. so that c1 = 0) as long as k2(1—a) > k1a.
13These expressions are derived by substituting (8)* in (id) and (le).
14This is the same condition encountered earlier in the discussion of

real income. Unless ga > 1 — a, the condition is somewhat more stringent
than the Marshall—Lerfler condition which implies only that g > 0. The

the domestic currency occurs with a low

possibility of an appreciation of

price elasticity because the domestic price may

then

increase enough to raise

the transactions demand for money.

5One exception arises when the labor supply curve is infinitely elastic
(n =

). The

real wage of labor in the frictionlesS economy then remains

constant (see le'), so consumer price

indexation leads to the same variation

of output as in the frictionleSS economy.

we ruled out another case where b = 1 (i.e., where this

The model of the foreign country parallels that of the domestic country

except that there is only one good Involved. Aggregate

supply, therefore, is

a function of the price of that good alone; output responds to unanticipated
changes in that price if there is Incomplete indexation (or bt less than

one). Note that for simplicity the money demand function Is assumed to have
the same Income and Interest rate elasticities as the domestic country.

If there is a monetary disturbance (u > 0), full indexation (b =
1) is
optimal since It can shield output fully from this disturbance.

With full

indexation, the foreign price rises and the foreign interest rate falls in
proportion to the disturbance as follows:
