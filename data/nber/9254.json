This article shows that computerization and use of the Internet are associated with greater hours worked as well as higher wages; that IT occupations are rapidly increasing their share of employment; that job search and recruitment are moving rapidly to the Web, with consequences for matching employers and employees; and possibly most important of all, that trade unions have begun to use the Internet as a tool for servicing members and carrying their message to the public, raising the possibility of a major change in the nature of the union movement.\n\n",
