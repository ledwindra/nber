       This paper proposes and analyzes a life-cycle model of consumption by couples. The
model is considerably more complicated than the standard model for singles because it has to
account for the welfare of a surviving spouse. The determinants of consumption are the survival
paths of each spouse, bequeathable wealth, the flow of annuities both before and after the death
of one of the spouses, a motive for bequeathing at the death of the surviving spouse, and the
parameters of the utility functions of the couple and of each spouse if widowed. The analysis
shows how consumption and the rate of change of bequeathable wealth react to variations in these
determinants, and it compares the consumption level of a single person to a couple. Summaries
of wealth change and consumption in panel data are given which offer general support for the life-
cycle model.

1. Introduction.

        The goal of this paper is to analyze a model to explain consumption by couples.
It is an extension of the model for singles by Yaari (1965), and therefore emphasizes the
role of mortality risk. It also allows for a what I call a "true" bequest motive,
bequeathing by a couple to the next generation, or at least to others outside of their
own two-person household. The distinction between a true bequest motive and simply
the provision for a surviving spouse is important because the surviving spouse is the
extension of the original household, and the survivor had a direct influence in choosing
the consumption by the couple when the deceased spouse was alive. This makes the
situation very different from a true bequest where the bequest depends at least partly
on motives other than purely selfish consumption and where the bequeathed has no
direct control on the consumption by the household. There is also a difference in the
planning horizon which causes important differences for public policy: if a couple
desires to give bequests to their children, and possibly to their grandchildren, they will
act in a very different way in response to, say, an increase in Social Security benefits
than if they only want to bequeath to each other.
        There is, of course, a voluminous literature on the life-cycle model, but almost
without exception it deals with the life cycle of an individual, despite the fact that most
of the population is married.1 When mortality risk is low this is not very important for
a wide range of research questions, but among the elderly where mortality risk is high
the model of a single person is not an accurate description of the decision problem
facing a couple.2 In many of the papers the focus of the work is on other aspects of
uncertainty such as uninsured medical expenses, and the further complication of
considering a couple may make the models untractable; but in other papers the focus is
on mortality risk, and thinking of just the life-cycle of a single person may lead to
inaccurate conclusions. For example, a number of writers have concluded that the rate
of dissaving is so low that a bequest motive must be important (Bernheim, 1987;
Modigliani, 1986, 1988; Kotlikoff, 1988; Kotlokoff and Summers, 1988). Yet at those
ages when mortality risk is high enough that the life cycle model predicts substantial
dissaving, the rate of transition from couples to singles is also high. Without taking
into account the change in composition with age, it is difficult to assess what the

       1Exceptions are Kotlikoff and Spivak, 1981, and Brown and Poterba, 1998.
        2See for example, Blundell, Browning and Meghir, 1994; Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes, 1995;
Levin, 1995; Attanasio and Browning, 1995; Laitner and Juster, 1996. In their lengthy review of
household saving, Browning and Lusardi (1996) discuss in a paragraph the issue of the age of the
household when there is more than one member, but go no further.

                                                1
appropriate rate of dissaving should be.
        The setting for this paper is of a retired couple that has bequeathable wealth and
annuities. For most of the analysis, I will assume that the annuities are indexed, as in
the U.S. Social Security system. I will further assume that there is a borrowing
constraint such that bequeathable wealth cannot become negative, even though the
couple has a claim on Social Security benefits. That is, future benefits cannot be use as
collateral for a consumption loan.3 The only uncertainty is mortality risk.
        The determinants of consumption and, therefore, of wealth change are mortality
risk, bequeathable wealth, the path of annuities including Social Security, and taste
parameters particularly a bequest motive. The objective is to analyze how variation in
each of these affects consumption and wealth paths. Because the ultimate objective of
this line of work is to use the model in estimation, the analysis will use methods that
can easily translate into empirical models.
        The analysis shows that a true bequest motive will reduce the rate of wealth
decumulation by couples just as it does among singles. It is much more difficult to
analyze how the rate of wealth decumulation by the couple will change with age because
the rate depends on the ages of both spouses and on the economic circumstances facing
each after widowing. Nonetheless, the wealth of couples should decline at least at
advanced age. A comparison of the rates of consumption and dissaving by singles and
by couples depends on the economic circumstances of each, as well as utility parameters
and mortality risk, so that no universal prediction can be made. In a leading example,
greater risk aversion, smaller returns-to-scale in consumption, and a low risk of extreme
longevity should lead to greater dissaving by couples relative to singles.
       The theoretical analyses form the basis of some informal tests of the life cycle
model (LCH) of consumption by couples and by singles. I give some results on
consumption levels and consumption change and on wealth decumulation by couples
and singles that support the LCH.

2. Model of Consumption by Singles.

       The optimal choice of consumption by a couple will depend on the value of
wealth to the surviving spouse in the event that one spouse dies. The value of wealth
will depend on the subsequent choice of consumption made by the surviving spouse, and
the optimal choice is the solution to the utility maximization problem by a single
person. Therefore, the analysis of the couple's model requires a prior analysis of the

       3in the U.S., Social Security benefits cannot be used as collateral.

                                                                                     expected
       The single's problem is to maximize in the consumption path {cj
lifetime utility



               Ju(ct)etaidt + JV(wj)etmtdt


The first term is expected discounted utility from consumption.
             = the utility flow from consumption;
       p = the subjective time rate of discount;
       aj = the probability of being alive at t;
        N = the maximum age to which anyone can live (aN = 0)
The second term is the expected discounted utility of bequests.
                                                            the economic status of
        V(.) = utility from bequests which may depend on
children in an altruistic model or in a strategic bequest model;
        wt = bequeathable wealth at t;
        mj = probability of dying at t.

         I will make the usual assumptions about             u(.): ' > 0 and becoming arbitrarily
                     u1 <0. I will assume  that V'  >  0 and that V' <0, but that V'(O) is
  large as cO,   and
                                                                     have incomes of their
  bounded. This is reasonable in that those outside the household
  own, so that if they receive no bequest they still can consume.
          The constraints on the maximization are:

              is initial bequeathable wealth which is given;

          wt 0 V t is the nonnegativity constraint;

           r = real interest rate (constant and known)
           At = flow of annuities at time .
                                                             which was based on Ya.ari, 1965.
           4This section is an extension of my 1989 paper,
                                                      3
         The nonnegativity constraint on bequeathable wealth can be justified by a legal
ban on borrowing against Social Security benefits. In addition, in data very few are
observed with negative wealth, and the few tend to have negative wealth as the result of
negative business wealth. This is likely to be the result of unanticipated losses rather
than borrowing for consumption purposes. The importance of taking account of the
corner solution (Wt 0) is seen from the fraction of single elderly with approximately
zero nonhousing wealth. In 1993, about 25% of those aged 70-79 and about 50% of
those aged 90-100 had wealth less than $i,O0O.
        The model places considerable emphasis on annuity income, which is based on
the empirical observation of its importance: in 1994 ninety-four percent of the elderly
(65 or over) had some annuity or pension income; seventy-nine percent had more than
half of their income from annuities or pensions. I take annuities as given exogenously
for the simple reason that in the U.S. almost no one has self-purchased annuities.6
        The solution to the single's problem is:

(2)                  = u(h    + p — r)   —
                                             hV   for Wt > 0


                 c=A forwt=0
and w0 given.T Here

             marginal utility of consumption at time t
             mt/at = mortality risk (mortality hazard)
       V = marginal utility of bequests at time t.
      A typical solution as would be found in data is shown in Figure 1. At T
bequeathable wealth has been consumed, and consumption equals annuity income after



        5Author's calculation based on wave 1 of the Survey of the Asset and Health Dynamics among
the Oldest-Old. See Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers and Wallace, forthcoming.
        6The high load factor on self-purchases annuities is thought to be substantially responsible
(Friedman and Warshawsky, 1988; Hurd, 1990). Taking them as given for this analysis is, of course,
a separate issue from their econometric exogeneity in a particular empirical application.
       7See Hurd, 1989, for a derivation.
        81f at some age greater than T annuity income declines more rapidly than the desired
consumption path, the solution will be more complicated: a lower consumption path could be optimal,
and consumption could fall below AT. This is rather unlikely, however, as it would require both
substantial inflation and large holdings of unindexed annuities.

        As long as w > 0, marginal utility will follow the path in (2), but with the
restriction that the marginal utility of bequests is zero; that is, V = 0. In that case, if

That is, consumption will always decline.
        If p <r, then    <0 when h is small as would be the case at young ages. At
older ages, however, h is approximately exponential so that at some age r,

Mortality risk, h, acts like an increase in the discount rate.
      The wealth path associated with the optimal consumption path is found from the
equation of motion of wealth (1). Let A A, a constant, which would be the case for
many in the U.S. whose only annuity is Social Security.10 Then

        9The analysis of this section is a generalized version of the analysis in Bernheim (1987).
         10The annuity income of singles is rather effectively indexed: in 1994, 77 percent of elderly
singles had no private pension or annuity income, while just 10 percent had no Social Security income.
Private pensions are typically not indexed formally, but only 12% of elderly singles had 20 percent or
more of their income from private pensions (Grad, 1996), and even then some private pensions are
partially indexed, if only on an ad hoc basis.

                                                   5
which violates the transversality condition for utility maximization.'1 Therefore,

        dw <0 V t > r as long as Wj > 0.12 This is a main implication of the LCH.

       To get an idea of the age at which wealth might begin to decline, suppose that
r = 0.03 and p = 0. In U.S. mortality data, h65 0.03 for males and h74 0.03 for
females. Then consumption will begin to fall at about age 66 for males and age 74 for
females, and so wealth should be declining at those ages.

2.1.1. Effects of Mortality Risk

                                                            dc
        Increasing mortality risk will reduce (algebraically) -- which will, in turn,
reduce (algebraically) .       This can be shown as follows.'3
       Consider two paths of mortality hazard rates {h} and {h} such that h' > h.
Thus h' can be thought of as the mortality hazard path of someone who is older. Let
the optimal consumption path associated with h be c, and the optimal consumption
path associated with h be c. Suppose that c0 = c. Then,

        dc dc
        -- <.-   0        0

because of the higher mortality risk. Therefore, for a time c <ct as is shown in Figure
2. Suppose that at some later age, r, c' = c. Then, just as at t 0

        dc           dc
            dt   r   dt   r
Because c' <Ct for most of 0 <t <T, w, the wealth path associated with c', would lie
above Wt. Therefore, at T w > 0 which implies that the consumption path is not
optimal: the desired consumption path has a negative slope, yet wealth will not decline
as long as c' <A. The conclusion is that c > c0, which implies that
        i1j the absence of a bequest motive, all wealth should be consumed by the greatest age
possible.
        12These general result hold for some other annuity paths, ones that are rising for example. If
the annuity path falls more rapidly than the desired consumption path, however, wealth will always be
held until the maximum age possible.
        3It is not particularly interesting to analyze what happens when mortality risk increases
keeping life expectancy constant because there is no empirical counterpart to this analysis: variations
in mortality rates by observable characteristics change life expectancy. This makes the situation quite
different from the analysis of asset markets where there is a tradeoff between average return and the
variance in return.

Thus, if wealth is declining under h1, wealth would decline more rapidly under h. An
implication is that ceL par. at greater ages the consumption path will be steeper and
the rate of wealth decumulation greater than at younger ages.

reduced relative to the CRRA case. Take c0 to be a function of w0, and then integrate

Therefore, under IRRA, c0 will be less than it would be under CRRA. The is
illustrated in Figure 3a. Relative to CRRA, the consumption path will be flatter at
high levels of consumption and steeper at low levels of consumption because

For the same initial wealth level, this will require that initial consumption will be lower.

If consumption is declining, which is a sufficient condition for wealth to decline, the first
term in the numerator is positive:

               c0edt — AST — wo> cte'dt — AST — W0 = 0.
                                         .• and an increase in bequeathable wealth will
                           d0 will be positive
Thus, under CRRA,
cause the rate of saving to increase: if an individual is dissaving, an increase in wealth
will reduce the rate of dissaving and the wealth path will be flattened.
       In the general case, however, a sufficient condition for      to be positive is that

               T d'
               f                  <•
As we have seen this will happen if       is positive. Then the wealth path would be
flattened even further relative to CRRA.
        If    is negative,      could be negative, so that an increase in initial wealth
           dc              div0
could case the rate of dissaving to increase. To see how this could happen consider the
somewhat artificial example illustrated in Figure 3b. Let r = 0, and suppose that
utat&0t d9, t T and that T x c* = w0. Then initially the consumption path would
be flat at c until T when it would drop to A. Now suppose that wealth is increased
slightly but that because of the shape of the survival curve and discounting,
utate0t < d9, t > T. Then the additional wealth would be entirely allocated to
consuming initially at until all additional wealth is consumed. If
                                                                       c0A is small and

could be made to be negative. That is, an increase in initial wealth would cause the
rate of dissaving to increase.

2.1.3. Effects of the annuity stream.

        An increase in Social Security could either increase or decrease T, and the effects
on the rate of wealth change will differ. Consider first a utility function such that an
increase in Social Security causes T to decline. Then, as shown in Figure 3c, the new
consumption path, c, must be everywhere above the old consumption path, c, because
consumption paths cannot cross: were they to cross the equation of motion of marginal
utility will require that the marginal utilities be the same both before and after that
point. That is, the paths would be the same. But if bequeathable wealth is to be
exhausted both at T and at T* the consumption path {c*} must lie above {c}.
       The path of bequeathable wealth depends on the utility function; but because
T* <T, w will be less than to over at least one part of the interval (0, T*). If the
interval is the entire age range (0, T*), {w*} < {w} and

       dw dw
             0          0


As  shown in Figure 4, the interval over which w <w could be less than the entire age
range. At some age, say r,          to,.. Now consider a different person with initial age of
r and initial wealth of w. This person would have a wealth path such that
{ w} < {w}. Therefore, for this person an increase in Social Security benefits would
initially cause a higher rate of wealth decumulation.
        We see from this example that increasing Social Security benefits can cause
to decrease. However, this result is not general because the sign of      depends on the
particular form of the instantaneous utility function. I demonstrate this by giving two
examples: the first is a simple utility function in which I show graphically that is
positive; the second is the constant relative risk utility function for which I show
analytically that      is negative.
     First, consider the utility function u*:

           *1 \   —   fe, c a,
       U
                      ja, c> a.
u and ii, another utility function to be discussed below, are illustrated in Figure 5. Let


                                             10
.4 < a, (h + p) = ), a constant, and r = 0. The utility maximizing consumption path
is

          —
          —
              f a, t <T,
              A, t T.
The path is illustrated in Figure 6. Let initial bequeathable wealth be w0. Then, T is
given by (a—A)T=w0. a1A>0 and
                   0 >0
             dA   (4)2
That is, increasing Social Security benefits increases T. Over an interval, therefore,
w > w, and an increase in Social Security would increase      algebraically. Of course,
in this particular example,


        d(dw/dt)       = 1 as can be calculated directly.
                   =

        This utility function does not satisfy the strict concavity assumption. But, as
illustrated in Figure 5, a slightly modified utility function, u, would satisfy strict
concavity, and it would lead to the same qualitative result.
    In the second example I take the utility function to be'4

                       1-7



     The optimal consumption trajectory is given by

        c1 = A7 aT e(r)(Tt) for t < T and

        Wt   = w0e + (A — cs)etds the budget constraint, with

        w0 given
        WT = 0, and
        c=A,tT
The consumption path implies that

Because 9T and 8T are positive,       is negative.15 Therefore, with this utility function,
increasing A could cause the average rate of wealth change over the interval (0, T) to
decrease algebraically, so that if wealth is declining the rate of decumulation could
increase.
       However, for empirical work one would like to relate the rate of dissaving at any
time to levels of annuities. That is, we need the relationship between        and A. From

The first term is the product of two factors, the first of which is greater than one if
wealth is falling, and the second is less than one. If the consumption path, which
follows the survivor curve, has a long tail, so that          is large, the first term will
tend to be large and an increase in annuities will cause the rate of dissaving to increase.
If the consumption path is rather flat but then declines sharply so that W0            is
                                                                                     T

small, the rate of dissaving will decrease. Bernheiin found
apparently the result of his assumption that mortality risk is constant, which implies
 that the rate of change of consumption is constant.
         These results also show that under some circumstances an increase in Social
 Security would cause bequests to fall: Suppose that over the entire age range (0, T*),
 {wt} <jw}. Then
             N                    N

              o


 where mt is the path of mortality probabilities. The left-hand side is expected
 discounted bequests with the wealth path w*and the right-hand side is expected
 discounted bequests with the wealth path w. Thus, an increase in Social Security
 benefits would decrease expected bequests.16

 2.2 Bequest motive: V > 0

        With a bequest motive the equation of motion of marginal utility is



        16See Hurd, 1993 for an empirical estimate ofthe effect.
                                                  13

              du
                     = ut(ht + p — i-) — hV   for Wt> 0

For a fixed level of consumption (and, therefore, Ut) a bequest motive reduces    and
increases the slope of the consumption path:

       dc               dc
        dt              dt
             vt>o            v_—o
Thus if consumption is declining a bequest motive will flatten the consumption path.
       Over an interval (0, t) where w > 0

              u0 =       at et   + Jv8 (r-p)s       ds

This equation says to allocate consumption between time 0 and time t in such a way
that the utility loss is balanced by the discounted expected utility gain from
consumption at t plus the discounted increase in expected utility from bequests. A
bequest motive will cause wealth decline more slowly; that is, more wealth will be held.
This can be shown as follows.
        Let u(l) be marginal utility when there is a bequest motive and Ut(O) be
marginal utility when there is none. Similarly for ct(1) and c(0), and Wt(l) and wt(O).
Let {c(0)} be the optimal consumption path of someone without a bequest motive and
suppose that at some T, wT(0) = 0. T could be N, the maximum age possible.
        Let initial wealth be the same: w0(l) = w0(0). If initially consumption is chosen
to be the same,

              du(1) du(O)
                dt       •dt
which implies that

              dc(1)
               dt     > dc(O)
                         dt
Thus initially Ct(l) > Ct(O)

But then c(l) cj(0) V t: if they are the same at, say, r,

       dct(1)
         dt T
                > dc(O)
                    dt



                                               14
and c(1) would remain greater than c(O) as shown in Figure 7.
       Therefore, wt(1) <wt(O) V L But wT(O) = 0 = tDT(1) <0, which violates the
nonnegativity restriction. The conclusion is that c0(l) must be chosen to be less than
c0(0) which implies that

           dw(1)
            dt         >dw(O)
                         dt
                   0            0

That is, a bequest motive causes wealth to decline more slowly
       This kind of result holds more generally under uncertainty, provided the
distribution of random events is the same for those with and without a bequest motive
(Hurd, 1987).

3. Utility maximization by Couples

        The model for couples is similar to the model for singles: couples have a utility
function defined over consumption while both spouses are alive, and they get utility
from contemplating "bequests." However, there are two types of bequests: wealth to a
surviving spouse, and wealth to a third person at the death of the surviving spouse.
In this situation couples will choose a consumption path {C} to maximize18

          f U(C)etadt + I M(wt)etpmdt + .1 F(wt)&Ptpf dt + J V(wt)&tmtdt


          U(.) = utility function of the couple
       p = subjective discount rate of the couple
       at = probability that both spouses will be alive at t.
       M(.) = widower's utility of wealth
            = probability (density) that the husband becomes a widower at t; that is,
the probability that the wife dies at t and the husband is still alive at t.
       F( . ) = widow's utility of wealth
           = probability (density) that the wife becomes a widow at t.
       V(.) = utility from true bequests (bequeathed outside the household)
       Wt = bequeathable wealth at t

        '71n this model all of the wealth of the couple is transferred to the surviving spouse at the
death of one spouse. It is only at the death of the second spouse that wealth is inherited by children or
others.
          18See Hurd, 1992a.

                                                   15
        mt = the probability (density) that the surviving spouse dies at •
This objective function has the same structure as in the single's problem: the couple
gets utility from consumption and utility from "bequests." The utility from bequests is
in three parts: future utility of the widower, future utility of the widow, and future
utility from a true bequest.
        The maximization is subject to

           = rw — C + A

        r = the real rate of interest (fixed and known);
              annuities, including Social Security and other pensions;
           is given; and
        WtO.

The solution is


(5)           = U(h + p — r) —    (M +
        U = marginal utility of consumption by the couple
        h = the couple's mortality risk (the probability density that one of them will die
at t given that neither has died before t)
        M = widower's marginal utility of wealth
        F = widow's marginal utility of wealth
           = mortality risk of the wife (the probability density that the wife will die at t
given that she has survived to t)
           = mortality risk of the husband

The solution has the same structure as the solution to the single's problem with the last
term in (5) corresponding to the last term in (2). In the case of the couple the wealth
goes to the surviving spouse; in the case of the single person the wealth goes to the
heir.
      The marginal utility of true bequests does not appear in the solution because the
probability that both spouses die in a short period is zero. The bequest motive acts
through the marginal utility of wealth of the widow or widower.
       Because of time separability of utility, the couple maximizes utility starting from
any arbitrary date. That is, as long as the couple is alive, we can put t = 0 and solve


                                             16
the utility maximization problem forward from that date.
        At a later time t either both spouses are alive, the husband only is alive, the wife
only is alive, or both have died, so the probabilities of these outcomes must sum to 1.
That is,

        at = 1 —       — — s m5ds
                              0


where   b = probability that the widower only is alive at t, and f = probability that the
widow only is alive at t. If t becomes small the probability that both will die between 0
and t goes to zero. Therefore, in a small interval of time a bequest takes place through
the surviving spouse, not through the simultaneous deaths of both spouses: one spouse
must die in order that the probability the other spouse will die and leave a bequest
becomes positive. Typical trajectories of the probabilities at, b, f and the density nit
are shown in Figure 8.
                                                     i
       The relationship between h, and can be found as follows. Let h0 be the
probability density that one spouse or the other or both die at t given that both are
alive at 2 = 0.

              at = 1— Jh50d3
and
                      df da       db
              ho= —=-+-+mt
Let cb be the mortality probability density of all females alive at 2 = 0, and       the
mortality probability density of males.
       Under the assumption that the mortality outcomes of the husband and the wife
are independent, the probability that the husband only is alive at 2 is given by

                   =      ds      [1 — f[L50   ds]


Similarly,

                   =          ds [1— sO ds]

Then,

                                                     17
This says that the rate of flow of husbands to widowers is given by the mortality risk of
wives.
         In a similarly way

              df __ /2g.

Then,
              mt = /1tbt   +—       0 as t —* 0   because b and f —* 0.
Finally, ho —f c5 + as t — 0. This holds at any t so that h = t + ALt. That is, the
mortality risk of the couple is the sum of the mortality risks of each spouse.'9
        In (5), h + p will be larger than if the couple is sufficiently old because both
and /2t increase approximately exponentially. Therefore, in the absence of the second
term in (5), U would increase. The second term flattens the path of U and could even
cause it to fall. Thus, with the usual assumption that U(.) is concave, the second term
flattens the path of consumption, which would otherwise be declining, and could even
cause the path to rise. This "bequest" motive (to leave wealth to the surviving spouse)
has the same effect on the consumption path of a couple as it does on the consumption
path of a single person. Beyond the fact that the consumption path is flattened, the
path of marginal utility is not easy to analyze because neither M nor Ft could be
expected to be constant as bequeathable wealth varies.

3.1. No true bequest motive.

       In the absence of a bequest motive, a terminal condition is that wt must go to
zero at the greatest age to which the household could survive. Further, if one spouseis
very old (say the husband), and approaches the greatest age to which that spouse could
possibly live, the couple should decumulate wealth provided the younger spouse is not
too young. This can be seen as follows.
       If N is the maximum age to which the husband can live, a condition for utility
maximization by the couple is that U Ft as t—+N. (This will be shown section 3.2).
Also, Mt—0 as t—N: should the wife die, wealth is worth little to the widower because
with increasing mortality risk, the flow of consumption will increase reducing the
marginal utility of consumption and of wealth to zero. Then,

         '9This would hold with assortative mating (where long-lived men tend to marry long-lived
women). The estimation problem would be to find empirical counterparts to the individual mortality
risks, as they could not be taken from a life table.

                  U+p
as in the singles problem. If , the mortality risk of the wife, is greater than p —r, U
will increase and C will decline. Therefore, wealth will decline: the analysis is the
same as in the single's problem.
       The conclusion is that the wealth path depends on ages of both husband and
wife. If the husband is very old and the wife is not too young (say, older than 74, as
was given in the example for singles) wealth should decline in the absence of a bequest
motive. Further, as the analysis of the single's problem showed, the rate of wealth
decline will be greater when the wife is older. In this sense, the rate of wealth
decumulation is greater among older couples.
       When both spouses are retired but have many more years to live, the path of
marginal utility depends on the economic circumstances of each should the other die, in
particular a comparison of the marginal utility of consumption by the couple with the
marginal utility of wealth of each survivor:

                  (U —          + (U —            + U(p — r).

Apparently, wealth could decline at earlier ages than in the example.
      The equation of motion of marginal utility (5) can be integrated over a small
interval (0, t) to give

where      is the mortality probability density of women alive at 0 and ,u is the
mortality probability density of men alive at 0. The interpretation of this equation is
that the reallocation of consumption from t = 0 to t will result in a loss of utility at
t = U of U0; the offsetting gain is composed of three parts: the discounted increase in
utility should the couple live, the discounted increase in utility should the wife die


                                                   19
between 0 and t, and the discounted increase in utility should the husband die between
0 and t. The approximation ignores a second-order term which is the utility from true
bequests should both spouses die between 0 and t, but this term goes to zero as t goes to
zero much faster than the other three terms because the probability density goes to
zero. Thus, the first-order conditions imply an Euler condition: marginal utility at
t 0 equals the expected discounted marginal utility in all future periods.
       The solution (6) is similar to the solution to the single's problem:

                           (r-p)t    I    (r-p)sm80 ds
                  = Ut aj e       + j V. e
                                   0

In both cases the path of marginal utility is altered by the expected utility from
"bequests."

3.2. Effect of a true bequest motive:

        The true bequest motive (bequeathing to heirs outside of the household) operates
through M and F5: a bequest motive will increase the marginal utility of wealth of
both the widower and the widow. This increases the right-hand side of (6) which
requires that U0 be increased. That, in turn, requires that C0 be decreased with the
result that more wealth will be held. Thus, the effect of a true bequest motive is to
reduce consumption which will eventually lead to higher wealth. This is shown formally
as follows.
       In the single's problem, a bequest motive reduced consumption which caused the
marginal utility of consumption to increase. A condition for utility maximization by
singles is that the marginal utility of consumption equals the marginal utility of wealth.
Thus, M(V> 0) > M(V = 0) holding wealth constant, and the same for Ft. Since

              = U(h + p — r) —         +

cet. par.

                                                       motive will flatten the consumption path.
Thus, if consumption      is declining,   a  bequest
                                                           include a bequest motive.

That is, wealth declines more slowly with a bequest motive than without.

argument just given. Should the husband live to N, he will die with probability one
and the wife will change to the consumption path given by the solution to the single's
problem as shown in Figure 10. Let ct be the consumption by the widow. Suppose that
cN(1) cN(0). Then the wealth condition on w(1) will be violated: wN(l) <wN(0),
yet ct(l) > ct(0), t>N, by the same reasoning as in the single's problem, and, therefore,
w(1) <w(0), t> N. The path ct(l) cannot be optimal because wealth would be
exhausted before T. The argument is the same as in the single's problem.
         22The figure also shows the change in the annuity stream at the death of the husband (N).
This is typical under Social Security law.

        If, however, c(1) <c(O), t> N, the lifetime budget constraint could be satisfied,
and wT(l) = 0 and cj(l) = A, t T' which are two necessary global conditions for
utility maximization. Whether this could happen depends on whether the two
consumption levels CN(l) and c1y(1) satisfy optimality conditions which relate the
marginal utility of consumption by the couple, U1, to the marginal utility of wealth of
the widow, FN.
        The relationship between the marginal utility of consumption by the couple and
the marginal utility of wealth of the widow is found from

As t—4N, the relationship becomes exact. As t—4N, a—O because the husband will die
with probability 1 by N. Further, MS—VN as t—*N: as the mortality risk of the
husband becomes large the marginal utility of consumption by him should his wife die
goes to zero in that his mortality risk becomes large. Then wealth only has value in the
interval (t, N) as t—N as a true bequest, and its value is VN.          is the probability
density that the wife will die at s given that she is alive at t, and JV 5dt—0 as

and

That is, as t—N, the marginal utility of consumption by the couple converges to the


                                                23
marginal utility of wealth of the widow. If cN is consumption by the widow and UN is
marginal utility of consumption by the widow, UN = FN and because of returns to scale
in consumption I imagine that cN < CN (although this last is not important for the
argument).
      If c1y(l) <c1y(O) the wealth condition will not necessarily be violated (Figure 9).
But then

              UN(1) UN(O) =        UN(O)   <UN(l)

The first weak inequality results from CN(l) CN(O) and the inequality results from
c1(1) <cy(O). But a condition for utility maximization by the couple with a bequest
motive is that

              U1(i) = FN(l) = UN(1)

Thus, the couple with a bequest motive should choose its consumption at N to be less
than CN(O). This will reduce consumption at all previous periods, including C0, and, in
fact, will require that

              C0(1) <C0(O)

The conclusion is that

       dw0(1)
         dt         > dw0(0)
                        dt
                0              0




That is, cet. par., the wealth of a couple with a bequest motive will decline more slowly
than the wealth of a couple without a bequest motive.

4. Effect of marital status

       The rate of wealth decumulation by couples will differ from that of singles
because of differences in mortality risk, differences in their utility functions, and
because of differences in their resources. To make a meaningful comparison, I will make
simplifying assumptions that hold constant mortality risk and preferences. There is no
obvious best way to control for economic resources, so I will give two examples based on


                                               24
quite different assumptions.

4.1. Households have same resources.

        I will compare a couple with a single person, and assume that each household has
the same bequeathable wealth and the same real constant annuity stream, and that the
annuity stream will not change at the death of one of the spouses.23 Each spouse has
the same (unisex) life table, or, for simplicity is the same age, the age of the single
person. There is no true bequest motive.
        Let the instantaneous utility function of singles be u(c), and the instantaneous
utility function of couples be U(C). I assume that the two spouses are identical in their
utility functions, and that each utility function is the same as that of singles. Let
household utility be the sum of the utilities of each spouse, and then household
consumption will then be divided evenly between the spouses. In particular let
U(C) = 2u() where k is a returns-to-scale parameter: if there are no returns to scale,
k = 2, and household utility simply depends on per capita consumption. If there are
complete returns-to-scale, k=1 and the household gets twice the utility from a given
level of consumption that a single person would get. I assume that 1 k 2.
        The equation of motion of the marginal utility of the couple, U, is

            = U(h + p — r) —             + Fi)
Let fit      = , with the second equality coming from the assumption that the spouse
are the same age. M and F are the marginal utility of wealth of the widower and of
the widow, and they will be equal because each surviving spouse would solve the same
single's utility maximization problem, and would choose the same level of consumption.
Because each spouse and the single person have the same life table and would have the
same budget constraint should one spouse die, the single person and the surviving
spouse would also solve the same utility maximization problem. The solution to that
problem is characterized by

      du =
             u(g + p — r)
and the marginal utility of wealth of the surviving spouse will equal the optimal
marginal utility of consumption by the single person. That is, Ut = M = F.
        231n the U.S. typically the annuity would decrease with the death of one of the spouses because
the spouse benefit under Social Security would end. My second example will cover this case.

                                                 25
      Then

          = U(2g + p — r) — 2gu

because h = +            = 29t

In that U(C) = 2tL(),

          =   u)       and           =          + p — r) — 2gu'(c)

where u'(c) =
      Suppose  for the moment that mortality risk and the parameters p and r are such
that g + p — r = 0 which would imply that

      du = u(g + p — r) = 0.

In that bequeathable wealth and annuities of the couple and of the single are the same
by assumption, the rate of wealth change will differ according to the level of
consumption. Begin with the initial guess that the solution to the couple's and to the
single's problem is that C = c. Then,

           =                     + p — r) — 2g'(C)

               =2g(u'() — u'(C)).

Thus initially, marginal utility of the couple will be increasing or decreasing according
to the sign of

       (u'() — u'(C)).

This can be stated in terms of risk aversion.
       Expanding u'() — u'(C) at k = 1

                —

The conventional measure of risk aversion evaluated at some level of consumption c is

so   that

            u'(c) + u"(c)c = u'(c)   —
                                         ycu'(c)   = u'(c)(l — Yc)   0 for Yc   1,


and negative for -ye> 1.
        The conclusion is that     will be positive if risk aversion (which does not have
to be constant) is greater than 1. 1 will take this to be the normal case, and I have
previously estimated (constant) y to be 1.12.
        Under the assumption that u has risk aversion greater than one (globally), at
least initially      0 and     = 0. Therefore the consumption path of the couple is
declining and the consumption path of the single person is flat, so that consumption by
the couples will become less than consumption by the single as shown in Figure 11.
        Suppose that at some later time, the two consumptions become equal again.
Now comparison of the consumption paths requires a modification of the preceding
argument because g+p — r > 0 due to increasing mortality risk with age, and to the
fact that wealth of the couple is greater than wealth of the single person.
        First, suppose as before that consumption by the surviving spouse would be the
same as consumption by the single person. Then,

()            dU  ,C
              __=u(1)(2g+p—r)—2gu(C)
            = 2{[u'() — u'(C)]g + u'()[g + p — r]}

               , dt
                 dt'

using     the fact that u'() — u'(C) > 0. Thus, were bequeathable wealth the same,
      >       provided risk aversion is greater than one. However, the wealth of the couple
is now greater than the wealth of the single because consumption by the couple has
been less. Therefore consumption by the surviving spouse would be greater than
consumption by the single, which implies that the marginal utility of wealth of the
surviving spouse is less than marginal utility evaluated at the consumption level of the


                                                        27

single. Thus, -— > --- when u () in (i) is evaluated at the consumption level of the
single. Evaluated at the consumption level of the surviving spouse t would be smaller
so that, a fortiori,

      dU du

       Thus, the path of consumption by the couple would remain below the path of
consumption by the single as shown in the figure. This, however, cannot be the optimal
path of consumption by the couple because at T bequeathable wealth of the couple is
positive: at T bequeathable wealth of the single person is zero and the wealth of the
couple is strictly greater; yet because desired consumption by the couple will be less
that A at T the wealth of the couple wealth will increase. Therefore should each
spouse live to the maximum age possible, the couple would die with positive wealth,
which violates a transversality condition.
       The conclusion is that initially consumption by the couple will be greater than
consumption by the single person, and, therefore, that wealth of the couple will decline
more rapidly than the wealth of the single person.

4.2. Households have same resources per capita

       In the first example, the couple had the same resources as the single. Now I
suppose that each spouse has the same resources as the single, so that per capita
resources are the same. In particular, let the wealth of each spouse be w and the real
annuity of each be A. Thus, initially the couple has wealth of 2w and a real annuity of
2A. Should one spouse die immediately the survivor will have wealth of 2w and an
annuity of A. I will compare the rate of wealth decumulation of the couple with a
single with wealth w and annuity A. The difference between the couple and the single
will be in returns-to-scale in consumption, the risk of dying with wealth, and the level
of wealth of a survivor. It will be useful to consider the problem in terms of per capita
wealth, annuities and consumption. In that initially per capita wealth and annuities are
the same for the couple as for the single, the rate of wealth decumulation will only
depend on which has greater per capita consumption.
        As before let the utility function of the couple be U(C) = 2u() 2u() where
c = is per capita consumption and, in a change of notation, k is a rescaled person-
equivalents parameter with k = indicating that each married person is equivalent to
of a single person, (complete returns-to-scale) and k = 1 indicating two marrieds are


                                           28
equivalent to two singles (no returns-to-scale). I will take the case of constant relative
risk aversion because, as we will see, the results depend on parameters even in the
context of this utility function, so little is to be gained from greater generality. Thus,
let




and to simplify notation I will let r = p.
       Then as before

                  = U(h + p — r) —                     +

            dc = —        2

        In that per capita wealth and annuities of the couple and the single are the same,
a good initial guess is that the couple chooses the same level of consumption per capita
as the single so that the two households would decumulate wealth at the same rate.
Their consumption paths will be the same if the rates of change of log consumption are
the same or if

Table 1 gives combinations of k, y and     that satisfy this equality. Larger values of
each parameter than those shown in the table will make the left-hand side of (8) less
than , and then couples will reduce their consumption faster than singles.24 Consider,
for example, k = 0.63, which is the implicit per person equivalent in the poverty scale
for the elderly.23 If = 1.8 and -y = 1.83,

(9              d1nc             —

            -          couples                  singles
If y> 1.83 and the other parameters remain the same the LHS of (9) will become less
than the RHS: that is increases in risk aversion would reduce (algebraically) the slope
of the consumption path of couples relative to the slope for singles.
        Suppose the left-hand side of (8) is less than so that

as shown in Figure 12. Than per capita consumption by each of the spouses would
become less than consumption by the single so that per capita wealth of the couple
would become greater than per capita wealth of the single. If, as time passes, the LHS
of (8) remains less than one-half, (10) will continue to hold and the consumption path of
couples will remain below the consumption path of singles. However, at T the wealth of

        24Note that > 1 and -                      k < 1.
        25According to the poverty scale an elderly couple needs 26% more than an elderly single.

the single is zero, which means than the wealth of the couple is positive, and the couple
will hold positive wealth should it survive to the greatest age possible. This violates a
transversality condition.
       To see whether this happens, suppose that at, say, i- per capita consumption by
the couple is the same as by the single. If the LHS of (8) continues to be less than
then

        dine                     dinc
            cit                   dt
                   couples              singles

will hold at r. The only change in the LES of (8) from the initial situation is in : c
is consumption by the survivor should one spouse die, and c is consumption by the
couple. Therefore, to see if the LHS of (8) is less than we need to examine at r.

as  long as neither path is liquidity constrained. At time 0, I assumed that the ratio of
per capita consumption by a survivor (whom I shall call an "original widow") to per
capita consumption by the couple was large enough that the LHS of (8) was less than .
If at i- the wealth of the couple is large enough that a new widow could attain the
consumption level of the original widow, the ratio of consumption by the new widow to
per capita consumption by the couple would be as large or larger because of (11) and


                                                       31
the LHS of (8) would continue to be less than . Therefore, the slope of the
consumption path of the couple would again be less than the slope of the consumption
path of the single and couple's path would remain below the single's path as shown in
the figure. One might imagine this is the usual situation, particularly because per
capita consumption by the couple has been less than consumption by the single so that
the ratio of wealth of the couple to the wealth of the single is now greater than two.26
Then, the couple's consumption path cannot be globally optimal because of the
transversality condition. The global solution would require that initially the couple
consume at a greater rate than the single, and, therefore, the couple would dissave at a
greater rate.
        By a similar argument if initially the path of consumption by couples is flatter
than the path of consumption by singles (the LHS of (8) is greater than ), initial
consumption will be lower and the rate of wealth decumulation by couples will be
smaller.
       According to this argument, large values of k, -y and will lead to a greater rate
of dissaving by couples relative to singles. Larger returns-to-scale in consumption
(smaller k) increase the utility from consumption by the couple, but decrease marginal
utility. Therefore, with small k the couple will reduce present consumption, reducing
dissaving. Greater risk aversion, y, reduces consumption by both singles and couples.
but more for singles: couples can share the increasing importance of the risk of dying
early. Thus as risk aversion increases the rate of dissaving by both declines but it
declines more among singles.27 A large ratio of c to Ct happens when the risk of living
to extreme old age is small (the survivor curve has a thin tail), as shown in Figure 13.
Should widowing happen at t = 0, the survivor would consume at a high rate because
the initial wealth of the survivor would be 2w, and there is little necessity to guard
against extreme old-age. The single would also consume at a higher rate, but the
response would be less because wealth is just w.
         I have said that at r in Figure 12, we would expect that the LHS of (8) would be
less than , which would lead to the conclusions about relative rates of dissaving that I
have been discussing. However, this line of reasoning does not hold if the wealth of the
couple at r is too small, because then c,,, consumption by a new widow, would have to
be small. The wealth of the couple at r could be small relative to the wealth of an
original widow as follows: The level of consumption by the original widow at time 0 is
determined partly by the shape of the survivor function at times beyond T. As shown

       261 will return to this issue below.
       27This is similar to what Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) found in a two-period model.

                                                32
in Figure 14, the survivor function could cause the original widow to set consumption
only marginally greater than per capita consumption by the couple, and, as a
consequence, have substantially greater wealth than the couple at r. In Figure 12, c
would be only slightly above c until time T. Then a new widow at r could not attain
the consumption level of the original widow, and, as a consequence, the LHS of (8)
might not be less than . Should that happen, the consumption paths of the couple and
the single would cross, and there is no longer a logical barrier preventing the
consumption path of the couple from being optimal. Finally, by continuity, a path of
consumption by the couple that has initial consumption slightly below initial
consumption by the single could be optimal.
       Nonetheless, an implication is that large values of k, -y and (all of which would
steepen the consumption path of the couple relative to the single) will, if initial per
capita consumption by the couple and by the single are the same, increase the wealth of
the couple relative to the single, so that at it is more likely that is large, and that
the LHS of (8) will be less than . Should that happen the optimal consumption path
would require that initially per capita consumption by the couple be higher than
consumption by the single leading to higher rates of dissaving by couples. Of course,
this result cannot be established with certainty without a global specification of the
survivor curve.

4.3. Summary of the effects of marital status on dissaving.

        Whether couples dissave more or less rapidly than singles depends firstly on the
economic resources of each. In the first example, a surviving spouse had twice the per
capita annuity of the couple, causing the couple to consume relatively more out of
bequeathable wealth, provided risk aversion was greater than one. Risk aversion
matters because it reduces consumption by both couples and singles, but the reduction
is greater for singles.
        In the second example, per capita resources of the couple and of the single were
made the same. Then the comparison of rates of dissaving depended on parameters of
the utility function and on the risk of a very long life. If that risk is large couples will
tend to dissave more rapidly than singles.

5. Empirical findings.

       The empirical implications of the single's model are:         < 0 at some age r


                                             33

       In the couple's model - < 0 if one spouse is very old and the other is
moderately old (age r as in the single's problem). If a second couple has the same
wealth and annuities but is older -- will be (algebraically) less. Wealth will decline in
these circumstances. If the couple has a bequest motive, the effects are the same as in
the single's model. Couples could dissave either more or less rapidly than singles,
depending on the economic resources, the paths of mortality risk and utility function
parameters.
      To compare the predictions of the analyses with outcomes, I have taken some
empirical findings about consumption levels, changes in consumption and wealth
changes from other papers.23 The consumption measures are, however, rather deficient
because they measure just part of consumption. Nonetheless, the consumption and
wealth data all lead to similar conclusions.
        Table 2 shows the change in a partial measure of consumption from the
Retirement History Survey (RHS). The RHS has direct measures of the following
categories of consumption: food purchased in grocery stores, food from vendors and
home delivery, food purchased away from home, nonfood items purchased in grocery
stores, gifts and donations, recreation and membership fees, and gasoline and other
transportation expenses (but excluding automobile purchases). I estimate that the
covered categories comprise about 34% of total consumption by the elderly (Hurd,
1992b).
        The changes are averages over a 10-year period. The unit of observation is a
two-year change in a household where the respondents are retired. The bulk of the
observations would be over people in their late 60's and early TO's.
        As measured in the table, consumption declines, and at a rather high rate.
Consumption by couples declines more rapidly than by singles, but there is no control
for total resources. Thus the LCH model makes no prediction about the relative rates.
        Table 3 shows wealth change from four panel data sets. Again the change is
calculated over retired households. We consistently see dissaving, and the rates from
the RHS and the SIPP are rather close.

        28p is rather important to control for retirement status: predictions about consumption and
saving behavior while employed are much more difficult because of the income changes associated with
retirement and because of changes in the utility function associated with the increased leisure in
retirement. All the results I give are calculated over retirees.

                                                34
        Table 4 has annual rates of dissaving by age and marital status from the SIPP.29
The rate of dissaving increases with age, except for couples 75 or over. Couples dissave
less rapidly than singles.
        Table 5 shows the results from a test of the bequest motive. It is based on the
idea that the marginal utility from bequests will be greater among those with children
than among those without. If that is the case, the bequest motive predicts that
consumption by those with children will decline more slowly than by those without
children.30 Among singles consumption does decline more slowly if the single person has
children, but the difference is not statistically significant. Among couples with children
consumption declines more rapidly. The overall result shows no support for a bequest
motive.
        Table 6 has a similar test based on rates of wealth change: a bequest motive
says that wealth should decline more slowly among parents. This is found in just one
comparison of the four. Again these results give no support for a bequest motive.31

5. Conclusion.

         Couples choose a consumption level knowing that should one die the survivor
will finance consumption from the wealth of the couple and from an annuity stream,
which would generally be different from the annuity stream of the couple. The
survivor's optimal consumption path will depend on the survivor's preferences
(including a true bequest motive), mortality risk and economic resources. This choice
puts a value on the wealth of the couple, the marginal utility of wealth. If the marginal
utility is high (as it would be if the survivor were young, or had a bequest motive, or
had a low annuity), the couple would choose a low level of consumption, thus holding
more wealth. In this aspect, the situation looks like a bequest motive outside the
family: the couple holds more wealth in anticipation of giving a larger 'bequest."
        However, the decision making is more interesting empirically than in the case of
a single person contemplating a bequest to the next generation. One can observe in a
typical householdlevel data set the complete financial resources that are involved in the

        29Age is the age of the husband.
        30A comparison of levels of consumption is not valid because of differences in wealth and
annuities.
        31This test has been criticized on the grounds that parents may be able to dissave more rapidly
than nonparents because their children will act as insurance against an excessively long life. Then the
two effects (bequest motive and insurance) may roughly cancel, making the rates of dissaving by
parents and nonparents approximately. My reservation about this criticism is that we observe very few
transfers from children to parents in data.

                                                  35
decision, including the likely resources of the survivor. This is rarely, if ever, true for
the study of a true bequest because data are rarely linked across generations when each
generation lives in a separate household. Further, the conscious choice of a
consumption level with an eye to the resources of the survivor is more plausibly
maintained because the survivor is involved in the decision making of the couples.
       The empirical evidence based on four data panel sets is consistent with a main
prediction of the LCH: wealth declines in old age after retirement. Under the
assumption that those with children have a bequest motive and those without children
do not (or have a smaller bequest motive), the data show no support for an empirically
important bequest motive.
