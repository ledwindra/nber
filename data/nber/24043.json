    "abstract": "\n\nThis essay discusses the role of Milton Friedman\u2019s presidential address to the American Economic Association, which was given a half century ago and helped set the stage for modern macroeconomics. We discuss where macroeconomics was before the address, what insights Friedman offered, where researchers and central bankers stand today on these issues, and (most speculatively) where we may be heading in the future.\n\n",

None of these interfered in any way with my research in this paper.\n\n\n"
