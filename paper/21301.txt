JEL No. Q53,Q55,R21
ABSTRACT
Urban China’s high levels of ambient air pollution both lowers quality of life and raises mortality
risk. China’s wealthy have the purchasing power to purchase private products such as portable
room air filters that allows them to offset some of the pollution exposure risk. Using a unique
data set of Internet purchases, we document that households invest more in masks and air filter
products when ambient pollution levels exceed key alert thresholds. Richer people are more
likely to invest in air filters, which are much more expensive than masks. Our findings have
implications for trends in inequality in human capital accumulation and in quality of life
inequality in urban China.

1. Introduction
Income inequality has been rising sharply in China. The Gini coefficient peaked
at 0.491 in 2008, which was much higher than the recognized level of 0.4 (National
Bureau of Statistics of China, thereafter NBSC).1. Xie and Zhou (2014) estimate that
China’s Gini even reached 0.50 in the year 2010. At a time when there is great interest
in the causes of income inequality (Piketty 2014), it is important to examine the quality
of life consequences of this trend. We study how private markets help richer people
to protect themselves from China’s high levels of urban air pollution.

We document

that richer people invest more in self protection than poorer people, and this exacerbates
air pollution exposure inequality in Chinese cities.
China’s urban air pollution challenges have been well documented (Zheng and
Kahn 2013). At the beginning of the economic reform in the 1980s, Chinese cities
suffered from black smoke produced by heavy industry, high levels of coal burning by
power plants and winter heating units. This activity created extremely high levels of
acid rain pollution in southern cities (He et al. 2002). In recent years, the major air
pollutant has been PM10 and PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter < 10 μm or
2.5 μm) which is largely produced as a byproduct of manufacturing production, car
driving and coal burning. The Asian Development Bank reports that fewer than 1% of
the 500 cities in China meet the air quality standards recommended by the World Health
Organization, and seven of these cities are ranked among the top ten polluted cities in
the world (Asian Development Bank, 2012).
Pollution exposure impacts both the quantity and quality of life (MacKerron and
Mourato 2009; Hall et al. 2010). Breathing polluted air as measured by particular matter
(PM) raises one’s risk of heart and lung disease (Chay and Greenstone 2003; Evans and
Smith 2005; Moretti and Neidell 2011; Pope et al. 2011). Chen et al. (2013) use the
Huai River winter heating policy as a natural experiment to examine the impact of air
pollution on life expectancy reduction in China, and find that the higher PM
concentrations in the north caused by winter heating lower 5.5 years of life expectancy.2
Ebenstein et al. (2015) document that life expectancy in China has increased by less
than what would be predicted given its per-capita income growth. They argue that rising
air pollution levels is a key explanation for this life expectancy gap.

According to United Nation’s standard, Gini index above 0.4 signals a large income inequality.
In China, cities north to the Huai River and Qinling Mountain receive subsidized coal-based heating in winter
months, while cities south to this Huai River line are not entitled to this subsidized heating.

Pollution exposure also has direct impacts on human capital accumulation and
utilization. James Heckman’s research posits a dynamic complementarity effect such
that young children learn more in school if they are healthier (Heckman 2007).
According to his model, children with worse health learn less in school and this
compounds over time so that these children are less likely to achieve their full potential.
Pollution exposure increases school absences and lowers test performance (see Currie
et al. 2009; Zweig et al. 2009; Currie et al. 2014). Human capital attainment is
negatively affected by life time pollution exposure (Graff Zivin and Neidell 2013).
Given China’s one child policy, parents have strong incentives to invest in a variety of
strategies to protect their only child’s health in the face of very high levels of local
pollution.
There are two strategies for reducing the damage caused by air pollution. First, the
government can introduce regulations to reduce emissions from various polluting
sectors such as power generation, industry, transportation, and construction. Second,
private individuals can invest in variety of environmental defensive strategies for
reducing their exposure to current levels of outdoor pollution. While investments in
public goods (the first strategy) broadly benefit everyone, investments in private self
protection mainly benefit the individuals who choose this option (Antoci 2009).
Individuals gain private benefits from investing in self-protection and averting behavior
(Smith et al. 1995; Graff Zivin and Neidell 2009; Janke 2014).
We use data from China to study private household investments to reduce their
exposure to outdoor air pollution. To study private protective actions, we use a unique
panel data base of online sales indices assembled by Taobao.com (see Section 3 for
details). From Taobao.com, we obtained daily sales indices by city for all buyers, and
also monthly sales indices by city for sub-groups of buyers (such as high-income,
middle-income and low-income buyers). We use the city level data to study how
household private investment in self protection varies as a function of government
announcements concerning the severity of the level of air pollution and to study how
these consumption dynamics differ between rich, middle class, and poorer Chinese
urbanites. We find that all groups respond to government announcements of severe
pollution by investing more in self protection but that only the richest group increase
their purchases of the most effective, and most expensive anti-pollution devices
(portable room air filters) when local pollution levels are higher.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the empirical and
3

theoretical studies on self-protection strategies and pollution exposure inequality.
Section 3 describes data, two hypotheses and the corresponding models. Section 4
presents the empirical results testing our two hypotheses, followed by conclusions and
discussions in Section 5.

2. Self-Protection Strategies and Pollution Exposure Inequality
2.1 A taxonomy of available self-protection strategies in Chinese cities
By choosing a city and a neighborhood within that city, urban residents have some
control over their exposure to air pollution. Cross-county migration research documents
that households reveal a high willingness to pay for clean air in the US (Bayer et al.
2009; Chay and Greenstone 2005). Using data from within the Los Angeles metro
region, Sieg et al. (2004) document that when the Clean Air Act’s successful
implementation reduced smog levels in specific communities that this attracted richer
people to move to such communities.
China’s central government has been reforming the hukou registration system in
the past three decades, and the restriction on labor mobility has been largely relaxed.
People are free to choose which city and which location within a city to live. Job
opportunity and quality of life are two major attractions a city can provide. Local public
services (such as schools, healthcare facilities) and environmental quality are key
determinants of local quality of life. Zheng et al. (2014) study standardized home prices
across China’s major cities and find that, all else equal, a 10% decrease in imported
neighbor pollution is associated with a 0.76% increase in local home prices. They also
report that the marginal valuation for clean air is larger in richer Chinese cities. Within
Beijing, people have a higher willingness to pay for those locations with better air
quality, such as the northwest part in Beijing. Using cross-sectional data on real estate
prices across Beijing, Zheng and Kahn (2008) find that, all else equal, a home’s price
is 4.1% higher at the location with a 10μg/m3 lower average PM10 concentration.
One’s residential location alone is not sufficient for describing one’s pollution
exposure. When the outdoor air is polluted, people will prefer to drive private cars
(rather than walking on the street), and they will also decrease their time spent outdoors
(Neidell 2009). Based on the estimate in Chen and Zhao (2011), the indoor PM
concentration is on average about 80% of the outdoor concentration in Chinese cities,
so people can breathe less polluted air when they are indoors on polluted days.
4

Moreover, modern buildings in Chinese cities have HVAC air conditioning systems
with air filtering which further improves the indoor air quality.
China’s nascent market economy offers households a growing array of products
intended to improve day to day quality of life. In the case of avoiding air pollution,
masks and air pollution filters represent key examples of such market products. During
a hazy week at the end of 2013, mask and portable room air filter sales reached 760,000
and 140,000 respectively, with the weekly growth rates (compared to the previous week)
of 52.35% and 74.1% respectively. Air filters are more effective (but also more
expensive) than masks in protecting people against air pollution. Research conducted
by the Department of Building Science at Tsinghua University, and tests conducted by
China Consumer Association show that the mean effectiveness of masks and air filters
is 33.0% and 92.0% respectively. That is, people with masks or air filters are exposed
to 67.0% or 8.0% of the original PM2.5 concentration, respectively.3
2.2 Pollution Exposure Inequality Resulted from self-protection strategies
Differential investments in these items between the rich and poor will exacerbate
pollution exposure differences and hence increase health inequality. As shown in the
cross-city and within-city compensation differentials studies in Chinese cities discussed
above (Zheng et al. 2014; Zheng and Kahn 2008), real estate prices are higher and
housing demand is higher in less polluted geographic areas. Thus, the poor live in dirtier
areas within a city.
Richer people have a higher probability of owning cars, which protect them from
the outdoor dirty air. Using micro-data from the 2006 Chinese Urban Household Survey
conducted by NBSC, Zheng et al. (2011) estimate the income elasticity of car
ownership is 0.81. Poorer people are more likely to commute to work by public transit
or by motorbike and this requires them to stay outside for longer time. Low-skilled
workers are also more likely to work in outdoor occupations such as construction, street
cleaning and package delivery. In contrast, high-skilled workers work indoors.
According to the Environmental Exposure Related Activity Patterns Survey in China,
the ratio of office staffs’ average daily outdoor time to that for all workers is 0.64.
Furthermore, richer people are more likely to have air conditioning, which means
windows can be closed on hot days with high pollution levels.
For air filters and masks, the former is much more expensive than the latter. An

average portable room air filter costs 490 US dollars, while an average mask only costs
and 0.9 US dollars. Consumers have to change the air filter’s strainer once per year but
a mask only last for about ten days. Thus, the daily user cost (including electricity
expenditure) of an air filter is more than ten times that of a mask. The sales data of
masks and air filters on Taobao.com in 2013 shows, the high-income group (the top 25%
of total consumers) bought 31.9% of masks and 47.9% of air filters.
Recent research has studied the consequences of inequality for mitigating
pollution exposure. Hotte and Winer (2012) model the optimal investment in private
mitigation efforts to reduce pollution exposure. Their model yields the prediction that
pollution mitigation efforts increase with the pollution level and with income. This
means that poor people spend less to protect themselves. They present a general
equilibrium model featuring both the production of pollution and the population's
optimal response to exposure to this pollution. Antoci et al. (2012) also explicitly write
out a general equilibrium model of pollution production and exposure. Bernard et al.
(2014) model private self protection and environmental regulation as substitutes. In
this case, effective regulation is likely to crowd out individual self protection.
Each of these theoretical studies is relevant for our work. In our study, we adopt a
partial equilibrium approach. The Chinese urbanites are exposed to a high level of air
pollution. Holding government regulation constant, people choose how to self protect
themselves. Given the extremely high levels of air pollution in Chinese cities, we do
not believe that increased regulatory efforts to reduce urban air pollution will crowd out
private self protection.
A novel feature of our study is explicitly introducing a spatial context where cities
differ with respect to their pollution exposure and income. In this sense we exploit
within nation variation, to test the self protection hypothesis.

3. Data and Models
3.1 Data
Many urban residents in major cities purchase products online. This fact allows us
to build a novel data base. Alibaba Group is China’s largest e-commerce company and
it provides the largest online shopping platform Taobao.com (with hundreds of million
online consumers) in China similar to eBay and Amazon. Taobao.com accounts for
about 90% of the online Consumer-to-Consumer sales and 57% of online Business-to6

Consumer sales in China4. iResearch reports that Taobao’s gross sales volume exceeded
1 trillion RMB Yuan in the first eleven months in 2012, which accounted for about 5.4%
of China’s sales of retail consumer goods in that year.5 Many daily consumption items
are purchased on Taobao.com because of its low prices and easy shipping. Our core
data set for city level sales of self-protection products is based on data from Taobao.com.
According to Taobao’s statistics, Chinese consumers spent 870 million yuan (US$143
million) on 4.5 million online transactions purchasing anti-smog products in 2013.
While concerns about the “digital divide” raise the possibility that the poor are less
likely to shop online, low income people in China prefer to use Taobao because its
prices are lower than bricks and mortar stores. It is likely that some of the very poor
people and the elderly may not use Taobao because they do not know how to use a
computer or have access to the Internet.
Taobao.com provides daily and monthly sales indices of each market good
covering the 34 major cities (all municipalities directly under the central government,
provincial capital cities, and quasi provincial capital cities, excluding Lhasa in Tibet).
By consulting the designers of this sales index at Taobao.com, we learned that the
equation used to construct the sales index from the real sales volume is a linear function
and the key parameters are constant for all income groups, all cities/regions and over
the whole study period (We do not know the exact values of the parameters). 6
Therefore, we choose to directly use the sales indices in our regressions, and this will
not affect the estimates of our key coefficients.
We collect the daily sales index data from November 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014.
This three-month time period covers a large number of foggy and hazy days, including
the severe haze at the end of 2013. In December 2013, the Pearl River Delta, where
Shanghai and Nanjing are located, suffered from the most severe haze event of the past
ten years. Beijing and Shijiazhuang also experienced terrible days of haze in December
2013 and January 2014. We also collect monthly sales indices from April 2013 to April
2014 for each of the three income groups (high-income, middle-income and lowincome). These categories correspond to consumers within the 75%-100% percentile
(“high-income”), 25%-75% percentile (“middle-income”) and 0%-25% percentile

groups, all cities/regions and over the whole study period. The exact values of these two parameters are not
released by Taobao.com due to confidential consideration. Mu and Zhang (2014) estimate that θ1 is about 63 on
average. Given that the two parameters are constant, we choose to directly use the sales index in our regressions,
and this will not affect the estimates of our key coefficients.

(“low-income”) in the distribution of the overall distribution of consumers’ purchase
expenditures. Unfortunately we are unable to access daily index data by income group.
The air pollution data and the daily pollution alerts are obtained from China’s
Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP). Daily and monthly PM2.5 concentrations
are calculated from the MEP’s official hourly real-time data. According to China’s new
Ambient Air Quality Standards (GB3095-2012) released by MEP, there are six levels
of pollution alerts: excellent, good, lightly polluted, moderately polluted, heavily
polluted and severely polluted. The thresholds of those alert are based on the air quality
index constructed by the MEP. Fu et al. (2014) list the detailed thresholds of the air
quality index for each alert. MEP releases hourly air pollution alert of these cities on its
website,7 and each city’s Bureau of Environmental Protection releases its city’s alert
on its own website. People can also access this information through several mobile
phone apps. We obtained city level historical weather record such as daily temperature,
humidity, wind speed and presences of rain, snow and fog from the website
TuTiempo.net.8
The recent public campaign in China has urged the state to create a nationwide
PM2.5 monitoring network. The recent MEP official PM2.5 data and the US embassy
PM2.5 data provide consistent readings. For instance, the mean value of the US Embassy
PM2.5 reading in 2013 is 87.4 μg/m3, and that for the MEP official PM2.5 reading at the
air quality monitor near the US Embassy in Beijing is 90μg/m3. Therefore Chinese
urbanites have been gaining confidence in the MEP’s air pollution alerts. In the case of
the United States, information disclosure regulation has been documented to have
success in increasing household self protection investment (Neidell 2004, 2009), and
this may also happen in China.
Variable definitions and summary statistics are listed in Table 1. Summary
statistics of the control variables, such as weather attributes and national holidays, are
not listed but are available upon request.

3.2 Hypotheses and Models

http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/China/CN.html

The online purchase data allow us to test the following two hypotheses.
Hypothesis #1: People respond to higher levels of air pollution by buying more
masks and filters. They respond to both government’s pollution alerts (determined by
PM2.5 exceeding key thresholds) and to the level of outdoor PM2.5. Market Internet
purchases of other goods (socks and towels) are not correlated with pollution alerts and
the level of outdoor PM2.5.
Hypothesis #2: Compared to poorer people, richer people invest more in selfprotection products when air pollution is higher.
To test Hypothesis #1, we estimate a model as presented in equation (1):
Qit =α0+α1·ln(PMit)+α2·Ait+α3·Xit+α4·Tt+α5·Ci+εit

(1)

The unit of analysis for Equation (1) is city/day. Qit is the sales index of each
market product (masks or air filters) in city i in day t. Here we use the daily sales index
data which is available for the short three-month period (from November 1, 2013 to
January 31, 2014). PMit is the daily PM2.5 concentration in city i in day t. Four pollution
alert dummies are included as Ait. (“blue sky” days, with the alert being either “excellent”
or “good”, as the default). Xit is a vector of weather attributes and control variables such
as China’s national holidays. Weather attributes include daily mean temperature,
humidity, wind speed and several dummies like rainfall, snow and fog. The two variable
Tt and Ci represent time trend and city-fixed effects, to control for the time trend in sales
and unobserved city attributes, respectively. εit is a disturbance term. We cluster the
standard errors by city.
The sales index is the count data, so we estimate Equation (1) using a count model.
We will use both negative binomial and Poisson models. In addition, this sales index
contains some zero-value observations, because a city may have zero sales of air filters
or masks on Taobao.com in a single day. To address this issue, we employ the zeroinflated versions of both count models (Lambert 1992; Cameron and Englin 1997; Sheu
et al. 2004; Silva and Tenreyro 2006; Helpman et al. 2008). The Vuong test is performed
to see if zero-inflated models are more appropriate (Vuong 1989;Greene 1994).
We estimate equation (2) to test Hypothesis #2:
Qijt=β0+β1·ln(PMit)+β2·ln(PMit)·middle incomei+β3·ln(PMit)·high incomei+
+β4·middle incomeij +β5·high incomeij+β6·Wit+β7·Tt+β8·Ci+νijt

(2)
9

In equation (2), the unit of analysis is city/month/income group. Each city has
three sales index series for low-income, middle-income and high-income buyers. Such
income group specific sales indices are only available for monthly basis but for a longer
time period (from April 2013 to April 2014). Qijt is income group j (1=low-income,
2=middle-income, 3=high-income)’s sales index of each market product in city i in
month t. middle incomei and high incomei are two income group dummies for city i
(low-income group is the default category). Wit is a vector of monthly weather attributes,
such as mean temperature, humidity, wind, and frequency of rainy day, snowy day and
foggy day. The coefficient β2 (or β3) of the pollution-income interaction term measures
the differential of the response gradient to pollution increases between the middle
income group (or high-income group) and the low income. The coefficient β4 (or β5)
measures the “absolute” sales index gap between the middle-income group (or highincome group) and the low-income group. νijt is a disturbance term. We will first report
count model results, and then change the dependent variable to ln (sales index +1) and
run an OLS regression (we add 1 to the sales index to avoid the elimination of zerovalue observations). We report OLS regressions here because of the ease of interpreting
the coefficients (β2 or β3) as the elasticities (% change in mask/filter sales with 1%
increase in PM2.5 concentration, for each of the three income groups).
As placebo tests, we also report regression results based on equations (1) and (2)
where we replace the sales indices for air filters and masks with those for sales of socks
and towels. We expect that there will be no causal relationship between the outdoor
level of air pollution and the purchase of these products.

4. Empirical Results
4.1 Results testing Hypothesis #1
We seek to study how the sales of masks and filters evolves as a function of a city’s
local daily PM2.5 concentration level and the local government’s alerts about the
severity of air pollution on that day in Table 2 (Hypothesis 1).

*** Insert Table 2 about here ***

In Table 2, the dependent variable in odd columns is the daily sales of masks, and
10

that in even columns is the daily sales of air filters. The omitted category of government
alert is a “blue sky” day. Columns (1) and (2) report the regression results using standard
negative binomial model as the benchmark. We report zero-inflated negative binomial
model results in columns (3) and (4), and then zero-inflated Poisson model results in
columns (5) and (6)9. The key results are stable over different model choices. Vuong
statistics show that zero-inflated versions are more appropriate given the data structure.
The results show that, Chinese households respond to government’s pollution
alerts and also respond to the PM level. Note the monotonic relationship between the
severity of the government alerts and the sales of masks and filters. Also note the
significant increases of mask and air filter sales when the pollution alert becomes
“severely polluted”. Based on the coefficients in columns (5) and (6), the daily sales of
masks on the days when the government has issued a “heavily polluted” and “severely
polluted” alert are 2.9 and 7.2 times those during a “blue sky” day. These two ratios are
1.6 and 3.0, respectively for air filter sales. This evidence suggests that the urbanites
trust the government’s pollution alerts.
Controlling for the discrete government alert, consumers also respond to the actual
PM2.5 concentration level by buying self-protection products, as indicated by the
significant coefficients of ln(PM2.5). People can check their smartphones for real time
updates about the reading of current PM2.5 concentration, and they do so more
frequently on the days when the government announces a “heavily polluted” or a
“severely polluted” alert. This effect is larger for masks but weaker for air filters. This
may be attributed to the cost differential between these two products – an air filter is
much expensive than a mask.
Based on a similar Taobao.com transaction data set, in an independent work, Mu
and Zhang (2014) find that a 100-point increase in Air Quality Index increases the
consumption of all masks by 54.5 percent and anti-PM2.5 masks by 70.6 percent. These
results are consistent with our findings here but our emphasis is on cross income group
exposure differences and hence on the role of income inequality, as we discuss in the
subsection below.
4.2 Results Testing Hypothesis #2
To test whether richer people invest more in self protection, we use the monthly
Internet sales data stratified by the three income categories and test whether richer
9

We also employ pseudo maximum likelihood Poisson model to estimate equation (1), and the coefficients are
similar with those in the last two columns of Table 2, which are available upon request.
11

people are purchasing more masks and filters on more polluted days. The government
alert variables are not available for this longer period, so the key independent variable
is the monthly mean PM2.5 concentration, and we interact this variable with income
group dummies. We first estimate equation (2) using zero-inflated Poisson model
(columns (1) and (2) in Table 3). We then switch to OLS regressions with ln(Qijt+1) as
the dependent variable, in order to obtain the elasticity estimates (columns (3) and (4)).
We also test if the results are stable if we do not add 1 to the sales index in the OLS
regressions (columns (5) and (6)).

*** Insert Table 3 about here ***

The coefficients of ln(PM2.5) is statistically significant for the mask regressions
(odd columns) but loses its significance in the air filter regressions (even columns).
This indicates that, when the air becomes more polluted, that the low-income group buy
more masks, but not air filters. This finding may be due to the fact that masks are cheap
so that even the poor can afford them. Many of the poor work outside and thus have
a greater incentive to invest in cheap masks.
In Table 3, we report results in which we interact the consumer’s income category
with the ambient air pollution level. Based on the results in column (1), we find that the
high-income group buys more masks than the low-income group as the PM2.5
concentration increases. The mask sales indices for the high-income and the lowincome groups rise by 1.3 and 0.4 in absolute value when the PM2.5 concentration rises
by 1% from its average value. This represents a 0.6% and 0.5% increase from their
original sales indices, respectively.

As shown in columns (3) and (5), we report

pollution elasticites and the rich do not exhibit

a significantly higher mask/pollution

elasticity than the poor.
In contrast, the air filter is quite expensive and its main function is cleaning the
indoor air. As expected, the income gradient for air filter purchases is statistically
significant, in both the zero-inflated Poisson and OLS models. The low-income group
has a nearly zero elasticity of air filter purchases with respect to PM2.5 increases, while
both the middle-income and high-income groups have a positive and statistically
significant elasticity of roughly 0.2. Those elasticity estimates clearly show that rich
people respond more when the air gets dirtier by buying more air filters which are
12

expensive but effective in cleaning the indoor air.
4.3 Placebo tests
Table 4 reports placebo test results. In those regressions, we change the dependent
variables to the Internet sales of socks and towels. These products do not offer self
protection against outdoor air pollution. The model specifications in the first two
columns are the same with columns (5) and (6) in Table 2, and those in the last four
columns are the same with columns (1) to (4) in Table 3.
In the case of socks and towels, we find no evidence of increased sales as a
function of government alerts of the severity of the pollution. In fact, we find that sales
of these items decline on days when the pollution is especially severe. As shown by the
ln(PM2.5) coefficients in columns (1) and (2), we do find that within pollution threshold
categories that there is no positive correlation between PM2.5 concentrations and socks
and towel sales. In columns (3) to (6), the coefficients of interaction terms are almost
all statistically insignificant.

5. Conclusion
Chinese urbanites engage in self-protection against air pollution and richer
individuals are more likely to make these investments. For a given level of outdoor air
pollution, an individual can reduce her exposure by spending less time outside, and
wearing a mask when one is outside. Such an individual can reduce her exposure to
indoor air pollution by purchasing an effective filter. Based on a unique data set of
Internet purchases, we study household investment in two different self protection
products varies as a function of ambient city pollution levels exceeding key alert
thresholds. The sales of masks on the days when the government has issued a “heavily
polluted” and “severely polluted” alert are 2.9 and 7.2 times those during a “blue sky”
day. These two ratios are 1.6 and 3.0 respectively for air filter sales. Controlling for the
discrete government alert, consumers also respond to the actual PM2.5 concentration
level by buying more masks and air filters.
We also find that richer people invest more in self protection products, especially
the more expensive but more effective devices like air filters, when air pollution is
higher. The low-income group exhibits a very flat air filter purchase propensity as a
function of PM2.5 concentration increases, while the middle-income and high-income
groups have an elasticity of roughly 0.2. Air filters are more effective than masks in
13

protecting people from air pollution. This poor versus rich differential propensity to
invest in self protection means that air pollution exposure exacerbates quality of life
inequality in Chinese cities because the poor are exposed to more risk.10
Given the investment differentials we have documented, future research could use
a field experiment research design in which the urban poor are randomly selected to
receive information about the day to day pollution exposure they face.

A more

expensive field experiment would subsidize the purchase price of masks and air filters.
The research could then test whether mask and air filter purchases increase for the
treatment group and by how much. Such research would be useful for judging how
much of the rich/poor investment gap is due to information access versus price effects.

We combined our regression results with other datasets, such as the Environmental Exposure Related Activity
Patterns Survey of Chinese Population and existing experiments on the effectiveness of self-protection products. A
rough estimate shows that the surrounding PM2.5 concentration for poor people is about 28% higher than rich
people on average.
