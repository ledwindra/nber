ABSTRACT
We use new manufacturing GDP time series to examine the industrialization in Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, and Colombia since the early twentieth century. We uncover variation across countries and
over time that the literature on industrialization had overlooked. Rather than providing a single
explanation of how specific shocks or policies shaped the industrialization of the region, our
argument is that the timing of the industrial take off was linked to initial conditions, while
external shocks and macroeconomic and trade policy explain the variation in the rates of
industrialization after the 1930s and favorable terms of trade and liberalization explain deindustrialization after 1990.

Abstract
We use new manufacturing GDP time series to examine the industrialization in
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia since the early twentieth century. We uncover
variation across countries and over time that the literature on industrialization had
overlooked. Rather than providing a single explanation of how specific shocks or policies
shaped the industrialization of the region, our argument is that the timing of the industrial
take off was linked to initial conditions, while external shocks and macroeconomic and
trade policy explain the variation in the rates of industrialization after the 1930s and
favorable terms of trade and liberalization explain de-industrialization after 1990.

Introduction
Between the late nineteenth century and the 1970s, the largest economies in South America
had one of the most impressive rates of industrial catch up in the world (Bénétrix, et al., 2012;
Williamson, 2006). Yet, despite the fact that these South American countries were all
commodity exporters, that they shared similar culture, religion, and colonial origin, there was
wide variation in the rate at which they industrialized. Not only did they industrialize at
different points in time, but also at a different pace.
In this chapter we take a long term view and examine the patterns of industrialization in
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia. Rather than trying to provide a single explanation of

how specific shocks or policies shaped the industrialization of the region, we show there is too
much heterogeneity for a single theory to work. Thus, we provide alternative explanations of
how the differences in initial conditions explain the initial patterns of industrialization, while
external shocks and macroeconomic and trade policy, seem to explain the variation in the
rates of industrialization after the 1930s.
So far, the history of the industrialization of Latin America, unfortunately, has been examined
by specific periods and the data used to study such periods has often been disconnected from
period to period, thus leaving us with no readily available long-term series of industrial GDP.
Therefore, writing a history of the industrialization of South America required us to put
together long-term series of manufacturing value added (i.e., industrial GDP), labor
productivity in manufacturing, the size of the labor force, and various macroeconomic and
trade series from 1900 to 2010. We did so by merging together series that existed only for
certain periods of time and by estimating new figures when the data was missing.
These longer time series allowed us, for the first time, to uncover variation across countries
and over time that the literature on industrialization had either ignored or had studied in
pieces at the country level. Our main insight is that the patterns of industrialization in South
America are by no means homogeneous. For instance, Argentina and Brazil, the largest
economies in the region, had rapid catch up before the 1930s, while only Brazil and Colombia
had very rapid and sustained catch up with the US, the global leader, in the 1930s. The postWWII golden age of growth was also experienced in the four countries studied, but only Brazil
and Colombia converged faster than the industrial leaders in Europe and Japan. The 1980s
and early 1990s slowed down most of the countries in the region except Colombia, but by the
first decade of the twenty-first century all major economies started to industrialize again, but
not sufficiently fast to catch up to the industrial leaders.

2

With our new time series at hand, we cannot find evidence to support most of the traditional
hypotheses that have tried to explain the industrialization of South America. In our view,
there are four basic explanations of the industrialization of Latin America in the literature.
First, there is the “adverse shocks” hypothesis (Furtado, 1959; Nations/ECLA, 1951; Prebisch,
1950; Tavares, 1972), which argues that as a consequence of adverse international shocks,
such as wars, crises, or shocks to export prices, the relative price of exports increases or the
conditions to import worsen (e.g., financing channels are interrupted or there is scarcity of
foreign exchange), the terms of trade decline, and the internal demand for imports is
gradually substituted by local manufactures. This hypothesis is related to Dutch Disease in the
sense that this view posits that Latin America de-industrializes when there are commodity
booms (or improvements in terms of trade) and there is Dutch Disease, and, vice versa, the
region re-industrializes when there are declining terms of trade.
The second view of the industrialization of Latin America can be characterized as the
“endogenous industrialization view,” or industrialization as a product of export-led growth
(Dean, 1969; Diaz-Alejandro, 1976). In this view, South America industrialized when
commodity exports were thriving and there were favorable terms of trade because the export
boom facilitated the importation of capital (or increases in asset utilization) and, via an
income effect, through growth of the domestic industrial demand. Thus, commodity booms
should lead to increases in total manufacturing value added, but also improvements in
industrial productivity (Haber, 2006; Lederman, 2005; Williamson, 2011).
A third competing view sees industrialization as the product of import substitution
industrialization (ISI), or an explicit policy of industrial support that included tariff protection
or exchange controls, special preferences for firms importing capital goods for new industries,
preferential import exchange rates for industrial raw materials, and an ample set of industrial
policy tools that ranged from subsidies, targeted credit, pressure on foreign companies to
3

open plants in the region, or the direct establishment of state-owned enterprises (Baer, 1972;
Hirschman, 1968). Even though most of these policies were not undertaken simultaneously
until after World War II, a modified version of the ISI hypothesis sees the role of government
and the high import tariffs before 1930 as playing a fundamental role in the industrialization
of South America(Coatsworth and Williamson, 2004; Versiani, 1979). A modified version of
the ISI hypothesis argues that even if protectionism may have led to an increase in
manufacturing value added, such policies did not provide the right incentives for industrialists
to improve productivity over time. Therefore, even if there were increases in manufacturing
value added over time, labor productivity in manufacturing stagnated. This “stagnationist”
hypothesis sees ISI as a policy with only short to medium term success (Bulmer-Thomas,
2003; Colistete, 2009; Diaz Alejandro, 1970; Haber, 2006; Krueger, 1978; Macario, 1964).
Because our data shows that none of these hypotheses explain all cases for the entire century,
we argue that the industrialization of Latin America should not be explained using one single
theory. The drivers of industrialization in each country are not the consequence of the
adoption of a single set of policies or the consequence of a single shock that affected all
countries in the same direction. In fact, what the evidence suggests is that the most important
external shocks, such as the First World War (WWI), the Great Depression, the Second World
War (WWII), and the 1980s Debt Crisis had heterogeneous effects on the industrialization of
Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia. While some countries got negatively affected by some of
these shocks others thrived, and vice versa.
That is why our argument has to have two parts. On the one hand, we argue that the crosssectional variation on the timing of industrial takeoff is very heterogeneous and has more to
do with initial conditions and not so much with policies or external shocks. Factors such as the
level of urbanization, literacy and infrastructure development at the end of the 19th century
accelerated industrialization in Argentina and Chile and delayed it in Brazil and Colombia. On
4

the other hand, the subsequent variation over time in rates of industrialization and deindustrialization were the consequences of interactions between changes in external
conditions and domestic policies. That is, market size, spread of infrastructure, trade policy,
and alignment of the main export commodity’s market structure and macroeconomic policy
(or its misalignment) explain why Brazil and Colombia industrialized rapidly after 1930s
while Chile and Argentina slowed down. Finally, we argue that the favorable terms of trade
and the economic liberalization of the 1990s explains the relative de-industrialization in
South America between 1990 and 2010.

Data
In order to re-asses the history of industrialization in South America we need to have longterm series on industrial performance for Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia and series on
manufacturing productivity. Series on manufacturing value added have been produced by
researchers and agencies at different times. The most frequently used sources for estimates of
industrial output include the World Bank – World Development Indicators (WB) and the
Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA). A project initially based at Oxford University
and now at the Universidad de la República, Montevideo, collected and collated substantial
ECLA data and has made it easily accessible for free via an internet website named Moxlad
(Moxlad, 2014). The data made public on this website is slightly different to data we collected
directly from ECLA reports (ECLA, 1966). Still, after careful analysis we decided to use series
of manufacturing value added put together by local experts in each country rather than the
Moxlad or ECLA data. They are usually longer, they behave relatively similar to the series by
ECLA, and they incorporate substantial local knowledge. That is, they adjust the series in a
sensible manner and with consistent criteria over the entire period, thus cleaning the series
from some of its distortions associated with political manipulation of price indices.
5

We have included additional adjustments to the manufacturing value added series produced
by local experts. For Argentina we use manufacturing output GDP in constant 1960 LCU
constructed by local expert Orlando Ferreres for 1875-2012 (Ferreres, 2005). For Brazil we
use IPEA’s series of industrial value added in current LCU deflated by the GDP deflator for
1908-1970 and extrapolated all the way to 2012 using the growth rates of real industrial
value added in LCU (deflated by the industrial GDP deflator growth rates 1971-2012) (IPEA,
2014). For Chile we use the Díaz, Lüders, and Wagner (DLW) manufacturing value added in
1996 constant LCU for Chile for the period 1900-2004, extrapolated to 2005-2012 using real
manufacturing GDP growth rates from Banco Central de Chile (Díaz, et al., 2007). Finally, for
Colombia we use Colombia’s central bank (Banrep) real manufacturing GDP for 1925-2012
(Banco de la República, 1998 (updated)). The four series are converted into indices with 1960
as the base year (1960=100). We had to additionally estimated or gather information on the
size of the labor force, the population of the country, openness to trade, exchange rates, terms
of trade and other series.
Most of the series try to measure manufacturing activity not related to the simple processing
of commodities. In most of our series the data includes industrial establishments of all sizes,
different technologies (artisan vs. mechanized), and a wide range of industries. Most of our
series, however, are only accurate reflections of manufacturing value added after the
industrial census came into place. For instance, for Colombia the data before 1953 is an
estimate of the quantum of manufacturing production, and for Brazil the industrial GDP
indices are proxies using data on raw materials and statistics on textile production.
The level of the four preferred series identified is not directly comparable. Each one is in a
different local currency unit and the series are in index number form to overcome the
difficulties of not having common price indexes for all four series within each country. We
only compare average growth rates of the manufacturing value added in LCU and
6

manufacturing labor productivity in LCU. Since we do not have PPP exchange rates for the
whole period we prefer to assume that policy induced nominal exchange rate distortions are
(eventually) translated into inflation, and therefore accounted for in the series in LCU.
Although this is not ideal, estimating century long PPPs for the four countries is beyond the
scope of this chapter. Furthermore, the hyperinflation and currency change events in
Argentina and Brazil suggest this is probably the best way forward. The local experts have
faced and solved the best possible way the important challenges of adjusting prices indices to
hyperinflations and currency changes, and the policy induced distortions on exchange rate
during the periods before and during hyperinflation effectively translated (at least partially)
into inflation and therefore are reflected in the LCU price indices. Thus, average long term
growth rates are comparable, although care must be taken on interpretation if important
exchange rates or inflationary events take place precisely at the cut-off dates of the
periodization.

Industrialization in South America as an Heterogeneous Process

In Table 2 we show the average growth rates of manufacturing value added in South America
against the industrial leader over the whole century, the United States, and some key
industrial developed countries that experienced rapid industrialization before World War II
and rapid catch-up in the post-war period. (the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan). In
Table 3 we present only the net growth rates for the South American countries in our sample
after we subtract the growth in developed countries. In this sense, positive (net) growth rates
mean there is convergence and negative (net) growth rates imply South American nations are
diverging from the leaders.

The Pre-1920 Industrialization in Latin America
The period before 1920 has always been considered the “Belle Époque” of growth and
industrialization in Latin America. Yet, the Belle Époque refers to the performance of Latin
8

COL

America against itself in other periods rather than about the relative performance of Latin
America and the developed world. When we look at industrialization in South America against
that of the industrial leaders, only Brazil and Argentina have an outstanding performance.
Once we compare South America’s performance before 1920 against the industrial
performance of the United States (on the right hand side of Table 3) we can see that only
Brazil fares favorably. Thus, the Belle Époque is indeed an important period for the initial take
off of industrialization in Argentina and Brazil, but it was a period of rapid catch-up only for
Brazil.
Argentina was the front-runner in the process of industrialization in the first part of the
twentieth century, despite the fact it was experiencing a sustained export-boom based on
primary products. Our estimate of the decade-long average industrial growth rate was
always higher than 6 percent and at times close to 11 percent before WWI. This was an
endogenous, private-sector-led process correlated with the dynamism of the export economy.
For instance, the industrial boom was tightly linked to the development of agriculture, which
being more labor intensive than cattle rising, produced forward and backward linkages
accelerating urbanization rates and giving rise to a new consumer class that demanded
manufactured goods. The initial industrial boom, in fact, was dominated by the processing of
food, beverages, textiles, wool and leather, tobacco, and glass, with some important firms
competing successfully with consumer goods imports. It was the beginning of an “easy”
import substitution process. During this first phase, the production of consumer goods
represented 72 percent of total manufacturing output. However, there were some natural
resource obstacles to develop a competitive “heavy” industry; such as the scarcity of coal, iron
and other minerals. This scarcity of important resources precluded the development of
machinery and metallurgical firms in large scale. Therefore firms relied heavily on imported

9

intermediate and capital inputs (Barbero and Rocchi, 2003; Diaz-Alejandro, 1970; Rocchi,
2005)
The industrialization process of Brazil, Chile, and Colombia began later (much later for
Colombia). In the 1910s Chile’s industrial output was growing a modest average 3 percent,
while Brazil’s was growing at 14 percent per year. The fast industrial take off in Brazil seems
to have started at the beginning of the twentieth century. Textile and industrial firms enjoyed
a rapid growth in internal demand associated with the coffee booms (and coffee valorization
programs), while they also had easy access to equity and debt finance between 1905 and
1914, helping firms finance machinery imports. The result was a rapid spurt in
industrialization during the fifteen years before WWI (Haber, 1991; Musacchio, 2009; Suzigan,
1986). Cano (1977) highlighted the importance of the almost forced import substitution
during WWI, when the disruption in shipping and financial flows led to a shortage of foreign
exchange and imported goods that created the conditions for domestic producers to
substitute imports. Others have argued that this brief spurt may have been just an increase in
capacity utilization, rather than an increase in industrial productive capacity (Suzigan, 1986).
In Chile, Palma (2000) argues that in spite of a virtual world monopoly of sodium nitrate
exports, the Chilean economy avoided Dutch Disease and started to industrialize in the 1890s.
According to this author Chile had an active policy of manufacturing protection, increases in
export tariffs and stable real exchange rate that propelled the local industry.
We do not have data on industrial GDP growth for Colombia in this initial period, but we know
that there were two coffee booms, following the valorization programs in Brazil (in 1906 and
on and off in the 1920s). The coffee booms combined with increased protection to
manufacturing induced creation for the first time of a long-lasting non-durable consumer
products industry and a few less lasting coffee machinery producers. Moreover, it was during
the second coffee boom that the manufacturing sector could also take advantage of a nascent
10

financial and transportation infrastructure in Colombia(Arango, 1977; Bell, 1921; McGreevy,
1971; Palacios, 1980).
Labor productivity growth in the four countries in our sample and the US is presented in
Table 4. In Argentina and Brazil labor productivity growth was faster than that in the US
during this period. Thus, labor productivity data strengthens the evidence supporting the
argument that Argentina and Brazil experienced endogenous industrialization with significant
improvements in productivity (Haber 2006).
Initial conditions
How can we explain the fast start of Argentina and slow of Colombia? It is unlikely that we can
explain the heterogeneous timing of industrial take-off with any of the specific
industrialization hypothesis presented above. Instead, we want to argue that we should move
away from these theories that try to explain industrialization for the entire region, into
detailed research exploiting the heterogeneity in initial conditions, external conditions, policy,
and outcomes. We suggest that perhaps the variation in industrialization outcomes may be
better explained by first focusing on understanding variation in the initial conditions. That is,
we argue that the heterogeneous initial conditions affecting the speed of technology adoption
processes (absorptive capacity and market demand) may explain better the timing of
industrial take-off than any of the theories presented above.
The rest of this section focuses on the initial conditions determining the timing of industrial
take-off: human capital and agglomeration economies facilitating absorption of new ideas and
machines, and population size, urbanization and low transport costs integrating the local
economy influencing the size and growth of market demand for manufactures.
By 1900, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia had consolidated their status as independent
countries and only Colombia still waged a civil war that soon would finish and open a long
11

period of relative peace. The inflow of migrants and capital from Europe was at its peak,
contributing, to differing degrees to the four countries, to expand domestic productive
capacity and integration to the world economy increased substantially (O'Rourke and
Williamson, 1999; Obstfeld and Taylor, 2004; Stone, 1999; Williamson, 2011).
A casual inspection of the demographic and education data in Table 5 shows that initial
conditions (at the beginning of the twentieth century) were very different across the countries
we study. Argentina and Chile were closer to achieving European levels of literacy, while
Brazil and Colombia lagged behind. As Sokoloff and Engerman (2000) remind us, the relative
failure in accelerating literacy rates retarded economic growth and might have been a crucial
obstacle that postponed the take-off of the industrialization process. The adoption of new
technologies and the capacity to innovate is partly dependent on a critical mass of citizens
that could learn new techniques. Recently, some authors sustain that the type of education
imparted might also have been a deterrent to the adoption of sophisticated technologies: For
example, (Maloney, 2002) shows that for most of the nineteenth century these countries failed
to establish technical education. Comparing to other resource-rich country he claims that “By
1926, Australia had twenty-seven times more graduates of technical schools per capita than
Argentina, perhaps the most educated country in Latin America.” If this was the case, for some
time the genius to industrialize 2might have been driven by migrants who came with
embodied technical skills. For Argentina, still in 1914, the industrial initiatives were propelled
by foreigners. More than 65% of firms in Argentina were initiated and owned by first
generation migrants (Diaz Alejandro, 1970). Literacy and higher order human capital rates
may be good predictor for the increase of per capita income levels, but they most likely are an
insufficient condition to drive a sustained process of manufacturing. Faute de mieux, literacy
and engineering rates alone would have led us to predict—ceteris paribus—that Argentina

state-owned airplane manufacturer Embraer, which adopted key technologies from foreign firms.

12

and Chile, instead of Brazil, would be the industrial leaders by the mid-twentieth century (see
Table 5 and Maloney, 2002).
Yet, that did not happen. Brazil took the lead in terms of industrial sophistication, and sheer
size, in the second half of the twentieth century. It started as a laggard because, as Musacchio,
et al. (2014) show, the initial industrialization of Brazil, between 1890 and 1930, did not have
the kind of skill-biased technologies associated with the second industrial revolution (Goldin
and Katz, 1996). Therefore, Brazil started with labor-intensive industrialization, with capital
that did not required skilled labor in a large scale and that was good to substitute simple
imported manufactures. As a consequence, the industrialization levels in 1920 and 1940 are
not correlated with say education levels for Brazilian states. The Brazilian government did not
introduce the kind of technical education necessary for the development of more
sophisticated industries until the 1950s. The National Council for Research (known as CNPq),
a Brazilian version of the National Science Foundation, and the Technological Institute for
Aeronautics (ITA) were launched in 1950, the National Institute of Applied Math (IMPA) in
1951, and the State University of Campinas—a university with a strong emphasis on
engineering—was not founded until the early 1960s. The expansion of national labs and
research centers continued in the 1970s and coincided with the dramatic changes in the
manufacturing industry presented in Table 6, and with the rise of Brazil as a leader in
innovation in areas such as agricultural research (e.g., with the creation of the Brazilian
National Agricultural Research Company, known as Embrapa in 1973) and aeronautics.
What about urbanization? It is well known that urbanization is closely associated with
increases in per capita income. Several studies even suggest that an increasingly urban
economy is related to industrial growth (the benefits of agglomeration effects). However, the
increases in rents experienced by an increasingly productive natural resources sector can
generate two types of urban employment: in the tradable and in the non-tradable or service
13

sectors. South America’s leading urbanization process was probably of a hybrid nature;
Buenos Aires, Santiago, Sao Paulo, Bogotá, Medellín, and Rio de Janeiro were hybrid
consumption and production cities. Initially, the development of an incipient industry relied
much more on the spurt of internal demand and exports than on a natural industrial-led push.
Firms located in urban enclaves dealt with the processing of primary sector goods and later
with the substitution of imports for domestic purposes. Brazil and Colombia’s urbanization
process came much later though, and their industrial catch-up was extremely fast. After 1940,
the story of the acceleration of urbanization might have been caused by an industrial ledprocess due to the artificial change in relative prices favorable to manufacturing. This was
certainly the case for Argentina and Chile, and in the Southeast of Brazil.

In Colombia urban concentration of the scale found in our other countries came much later.
By 1912 there were two important urban centers, Bogotá and Medellín. The former was the
the political capital of Colombia, with 120,000 inhabitants in 1912, and focused on the
production of foods. Medellín, with 70,000 inhabitants, had basic manufacturing activity
focused on food and beverages and textiles (Melo, 1987), while Buenos Aires had 1.2 million
in 1910, Santiago 390,000 in 1900 and Sao Paulo 240,000 in 1900.
Moreover, the actual market potential for manufactured goods was not only determined by
urbanization, but also by transportation costs (to sell manufactured goods and to import raw
materials) (Krugman, 1993). In that regard, Buenos Aires and Santiago, the key initial
industrial hubs in Argentina and Chile, had the initial advantage of being close to the coast,
thus facing lower transportation costs for raw materials and having easier access to internal
and external markets (by boat). In contrast, Sao Paulo, Bogotá and Medellín had, initially,
more difficult access from the coast. In Sao Paulo, until the early part of the twentieth century,
the railway lines connecting the coast to the interior plateau of the state were not fully
developed. In Bogotá and Medellín, the location of main urban settlements on top of the Andes
probably made it harder to trade with the rest of the world and within Colombia than for any
of the other three countries in our sample.
One way to gauge the transportation challenges of Colombia and Brazil is to look at the
railway and road density they had during the take-off period (Herranz-Loncán, 2014). In
Table 5 we present our estimates of railway and road kilometers per million people and it is
clear that Chile and Argentina had an initial advantage. Thus, Brazil, with scattered population
15

and a large market was at a disadvantage and its infrastructure network did not really
compare to that of Argentina and Chile, on a per capita basis, until after WWII. In Colombia,
the poor rail and road infrastructure and the challenging topography complicated market
integration until the second half of the twentieth century when the large urban centers
provided markets big enough for domestic industries to develop at a large scale. The road
network of Colombia even in the year 2000 was still small in relative terms; comparable only
to the density of roads Brazil had at the turn of the century.
We believe population size may be another factor determining the extent of specialization and
diversification in manufacturing in the countries we study. Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny
(1989) described the benefits of size in models of “take-off” or “big push” industrialization,
where the take-off phase is characterized by a transition from a slow growth, constant returns
to scale technology to an endogenous growth and an increasing returns to scale technology.
Size might enhance growth because it allows for product market competition. Thus, size
increases the chances for a balanced industrialization.
As we can see from Table 5 the Argentine economy had a size advantage when it came to its
major urban center (Buenos Aires). The country was more urbanized than any other country
in the region and most of the population lived in the larger Buenos Aires area. That may
explain the initial take off of Argentina and its initial leadership as early industrializer in South
America. Brazil, despite its larger population, was a much more rural country and before 1900
most of the population centers were scattered around the country, with extremely poor
communication and road networks.
Now, the rapid population growth and urbanization in Brazil and Colombia after 1940 may
explain their positive and sustained industrial performance and catch-up with Argentina’s
manufacturing value added per capita. In contrast, Argentina and Chile’s population growth

16

does not keep pace with Brazil and Colombia and they also suffer more macro distortions
after 1940 that complicate their industrialization.

Industrial Performance During the Roaring Twenties
Performance during the roaring twenties seems to have been varied across South America.
Argentina, Brazil and Chile experienced growth spurts during the first half of the decade, and
then average growth rates declined. For Argentina, the 1920s were the period of most rapid
convergence in the period we are studying. Industry grew at an average annual rate of 6.5
percent induced by growing manufacturing demand derived from exports facing positive
terms of trade. Incumbent firms experienced important capacity expansion and structural
transformation in the “traditional” sectors (food, beverages, tobacco, meatpacking houses,
sugar mills, and tanning firms) and new sectors developed, such as rubber products,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, machinery and electrical equipment. The “front-runner” was
expected to enter into a second phase of industrialization. The new sectors, altogether,
doubled their share in manufacturing industry increasing from 13 percent in 1920 to 21
percent in 1930. This process took place well before an attempt to have an explicit state-led
import-substitution strategy (Pineda, 2009). The case of Argentina during the 1920s supports
the hypothesis of endogenous industrialization.
In Chile, in the 1920s, the decline in the nitrate industry due to the improvement in the
production of synthetic nitrates in the core countries was a first blow to Chilean exports. The
decade started with a 50% nominal devaluation rate and an increased degree of protection
which produced a transitory spurt in manufacturing. Yet, with the still very high terms of
trade, the real exchange rate appreciated substantially and the rate of manufacturing growth
diminished and even became negative in some years (Muñoz, 1968; Palma, 2000). Thus, the

17

1920s decade proved to be the weakest in terms of manufacturing growth for Chile, with no
convergence, until the 1930s.
In Brazil the 1920s were a period of rapid industrial growth, driven to a large extent by the
rapid advance of coffee exports and the improvements in national income. Despite some brief
recessions, the decade saw favorable terms of trade, rapid importation of machinery for
manufacturing, and a rapid expansion in coffee exports toward the end of the decade.
According to Stein (1957) and Musacchio (2009), textiles continued to expand rapidly during
this decade. By the end of the 1920s the government of Brazil instituted a coffee valorization
program and a fixed exchange rate (to prevent the rapid appreciation of the nominal exchange
once coffee exports expanded). These measures not only provided an impetus to
industrialization in the second half of the decade, but also kept Brazil’s terms of trade
favorable during the Great Depression (Furtado, 1959; Suzigan, 1986).
In Colombia, the 1920s represent a period of volatile manufacturing expansion fueled by
coffee booms, American reparations and large inflows of international capital once the Central
Bank was setup in 1923. During this period incumbent firms expanded capacity and adopted
modern management techniques. Foreign direct investment also helped to diversify the
industrial sector by expanding oil manufactures. The development of the railroad network
during the second half of the decade reduced the cost of transportation and the cost of capital,
and its construction also increased the demand for manufactures (Duran and Bucheli, 2017;
Echavarría, 1993; Meisel-Roca, et al., 2016). Although little data to assess overall
manufacturing growth exists, qualitative evidence suggests a mild process of endogenous
industrialization was taking place in Colombia, aided with moderate protection

18

The Great Depression and its Effects on Industrialization
In the 1930s, the growth rates of the four countries are positive. Brazil, Chile and Colombia’s
industrial output grew at an average 11 percent during the 1930s, catching-up with Europe
and Japan, but maintaining differences with the US. In contrast, Argentina, the regional leader,
had industrial growth rates of over 3 percent, making it the only country diverging from the
industrial leaders.
Brazil and Colombia were not as hard hit by the depression thanks to the rapid recovery of
terms of trade, largely due to their coffee valorization programs. In fact, our late comer,
Colombia, experienced rates of growth almost 9 percent during 1930s and WWII, to a large
extent because of the combination of increasing coffee exports, a large depreciation of the
exchange rate, protectionist policies and the improvement in transportation infrastructure set
up in the 1920s, which paid off in the 1930s. This industrial growth spurt focused mostly on
consumer non-durable industries (Echavarría, 1993; Ocampo and Montenegro, 2007).
Chile was probably the country that suffered the most during the Great Depression: exports
declined in 1929-1932 by 50%, imports by 83% and the terms of trade declined by more than
50%. Chile needed to pursue another model and the policy reaction was immediate. The
government engineered a devaluation rate of more than 300% between 1932 and 1935
resulting in a depreciation of real exchange rates and an increase of the real cost of imports of
about 100%. The result was an acceleration in the industrial output average annual growth of
7.5% (Muñoz, 1968). In fact, during this period, manufacturing started experiencing an
important structural transformation. In 1927 the manufacturing industries producing
consumption goods still represented 83% of the total. Chile was unambiguously in its first
phase of industrialization. The share of intermediate, heavy and capital goods industries
relative to total manufacturing production went from 7.7 percent in the early 1930s to 12.8
percent of total manufacturing by 1950, almost doubling. That is, the Great Depression
19

accelerated the process towards import-substitution of more sophisticated manufactures in
Chile. At the same time, government policy promoted explicitly an ISI model. In 1938 state
development financial agency CORFO (Corporacion de Fomento) was created to develop
strategic plans for agriculture, industry and mining and develop domestic technology
research (Ffrench-Davis, et al., 2000).
The adverse shocks hypothesis, which sees negative shocks in the core countries (and the
consequent policy reaction) as opportunities for industrialization in Latin America finds some
support during this period in Brazil, Chile and Colombia. Not only industrial output grew fast
in these countries, but labor productivity also did. The WWI and 1920s saw industrial capacity
to expand, and during the 1930s, facing less international competition, capacity utilization
increased and there was also some new substitution of industries in the region. The only
exception is Argentina, which suffers a terrible blow to its terms of trade and has, overall,
negative labor productivity growth in the decade.
Speculation about why the Great Depression was an additional obstacle for Argentina while it
acted as a boost for the remaining countries is that the front-runner was already attempting
its second industrial revolution by the 1920s and needed either to recover access to foreign
markets or/and a continuous inflow of foreign capital to finance the structural change. It is
well known that the post-depression years proved to be a fatal blow for temperate climate
crops prices and that international capital flows were almost nil, thus the reason why
Argentina has such a different path in the aftermath of the Great Depression from Brazil or
Colombia had more to do with bad luck than bad policy.

World War II and Import Substitution Industrialization
This is the golden era of import substitution industrialization (1944-1973), when
governments in the region implemented explicit policies to protect and promote the
20

substitution of consumer goods, and to some extent intermediate goods in Brazil (Leff, 1968).
Additionally, this period of rapid industrial growth coincided (or caused) the rapid
urbanization of these countries and led manufacturing to surpass agriculture as the most
important employer, with the exception for Argentina, which underwent this process earlier
in the century (Baer, 2008; Baer, 1972; Hirschman, 1968).
While Colombia, Chile and Brazil continued deepening their industrialization in the 1930s,
expanding their textile sectors and beginning to develop other industries (Lederman, 2005;
Stein, 1957), Argentina seemed to have missed an opportunity to deepen its industrial base.
Diaz Alejandro (1970) argues that by mid 1930s there was a missed opportunity to
implement a targeted industrial policy that would have enabled Argentina to follow a smooth
transition through sequential industrialization phases. According to this author, unless there
was another export boom in sight, which Argentina did not experience ever again (e.g., its
terms of trade in the post-WWII period were much lower than those of the 1900-1930
period), the endogenous industry phase turned into one in which from having current account
surpluses, the country faced recurrent current account deficits and external disequilibria. For
Diaz Alejandro, after the 1930s Argentina experienced a long period of drifting away from the
front runners in Latin America (Taylor, 1998).
Although Argentina’s terms of trade continued to decline and it would not experience
endogenous industrialization again, after WWII, it exhibited a relatively stable industrial
growth rate ranging between 4 percent and 6 percent. Brazil had an unstable but high growth
rate ranging between 7 and 11 percent. Chile’s industrial growth rate was over 5 percent
while Colombia’s one decreased to a still highly respectable average of almost 7 percent. The
four countries caught-up to the world leader, the US, but only Brazil and Colombia managed to
keep converging to the UK, Germany and Japan.

21

Protectionism and Industrialization
Beyond offering protection to industrialize the country, students of ISI in Latin America
highlight that such policies intended to promote industrialization in stages. That is,
governments, at least in theory, followed a series of policies to sequentially promote new
industries with higher value added and more technological complexity. Initially governments
were supposed to promote the consumer goods and basic building materials industries
because of their simple technology and their low capital requirements. Then, governments
supported more complex consumer goods industries, which required more sophisticated
technologies and higher capital requirements. Finally, governments were to target more
complex consumer durables, industrial inputs such as steel, engineering and chemical
products, and other heavy industries (e.g., Brazil and Argentina ventured into aerospace)
(Baer, 1972; Love, 2005). In theory this sequencing could include as a final link the
development of a domestic capital goods sector or a complex sector of industrial raw
materials. In practice some of the less capital intensive industries could lobby governments
not to develop intermediate goods that could lead to expensive inputs(Baer, 1972).
Certainly, the golden years of the ISI for Argentina were the 1950s up to the early 1970s. The
Peron administration (1946-1955) opted –by default—for an inward-looking
industrialization model that accelerated under the leadership of Arturo Frondizi (1958-1962)
an advocated the so-called “desarrollismo” ( the “developmentalist” approach). Already in
1960, state-owned enterprises controlled basic sectors of the economy such as iron, steel and
petroleum, energy generation, telecommunications and transport. Multinational corporations
were engaged in the production of vehicles, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, tobacco,
agricultural equipment and food processing (Katz and Kosacoff, 200). The industrial
structural change was significant between 1950 and 1970. During this two decades, the share
of heavy goods manufacturing to total manufacturing went from 20.5 percent to 32.4 percent,
22

while the share of capital goods manufacturing jumped from 9,7 to 22 percent. The relative
participation of consumer goods production went down by a third from a value of 61.4
percent in 1950. By the mid-60s a domestic ISI model was in place; the question was then
whether the battery of protectionist and fiscal policies to support it were sustainable
overtime.
In Table 6 we depict the change in industrial structure in Brazil during the post-WWII period.
We separate the manufacturing industries from the extractive industries into groups that
broadly represent the stages the import substitution industrialization hypothesis would
expect to see as protectionist policies were implemented. Brazil is the country that has the
largest leap in industrial sophistication in the post-WWII period. The manufacturing
industries producing consumer goods (associated with the first stage of import substitution)
represented close to 60 percent of the total by 1939 and ended up representing less than 30
percent of the total by the 1970s. In contrast, heavier industries producing metals, chemicals,
plastics, and pharmaceuticals (which we associate with the second stage of sophistication of
import substitution) almost doubled their importance between 1939 and 1980, going from 17
to 30 percent of total manufacturing. The rapid increase in these stage II industries that took
place in the 1960s and 1970s is associated with the explicit development plans of the military
government to promote heavy industries. Finally, industries we would associate with Stage III
of import substitution, such as mechanical industries, electrical and telecommunications
equipment, and transportation equipment (automobiles & airplanes), gain momentum after
the 1950s and reach 24 percent of total manufactures by 1980. This is the heyday of industrial
policy in Brazil, when the military government (1964-1985), through policy stability and
excessive external indebtedness, provided subsidized financing and put in place some of the
infrastructure and raw materials needed to develop some of the most sophisticated industries
in the country. The role of state-owned enterprises was key in providing cheap raw materials,
23

subsidized credit, and cooperating with the private sector to develop the airplane industry,
the large petrochemical sector, and the electricity and telecommunications sector in the
country (Musacchio and Lazzarini, 2014).
According to Leff (1968), by 1949 the local capital goods industry provided over 60 percent of
the domestic demand for industrial equipment. This development is even more impressive if
we consider that the nascent capital goods industry developed despite the competition from
foreign imports until at least the 1960s, when imports of machinery had preferential exchange
rate treatment and duty-free importation. In fact, Leff (1968) argues, the development of the
Brazilian capital goods industry was so impressive, that the “domestic supply coefficient [for
capital goods] was more than three times larger than in Argentina during the same years” (p.
8).
In Colombia the ISI policies also involved the development of industrial banks and creative
exchange rate devaluation mechanisms to reduce the chance of recurrent foreign exchange
crisis (Berry and Thoumi, 1989, Brando, 2012). Manufacturing industry had a significant
transformation between 1955 and 1970 (see Table 6). The production of durables and
intermediate goods had a rapid increase, going from 4.6 and 16 percent of manufacturing
value added, to 14 and 39 percent, respectively, in that period. These shares would then
remain constant for most of the twentieth century.
An additional important fact about the post-World War II period is that our “front-runner,”
Argentina, lags behind, at least relative to Brazil, Colombia and to itself. Krugman (1993)
argues that the inward orientation is a partial explanation for a performance well below its
growth potential because external contestability was not a threat for domestic producers. But
most importantly for Argentina, the ISI was an “incomplete model” as the inadequate growth
of industrial exports during this whole period was still an obstacle to the industrialization

24

process. Furthermore, the Argentine government attempts to develop a large-scale, heavy
industry required a continuous injection of public subsidies.
During the ISI golden age Chile caught up with the US but lost the opportunity to catch-up
faster, as UK, Germany, Japan, Brazil and Colombia did. In the 1950-1972 period, during the
heyday of the ISI period, the manufacturing industry was still growing at 5 % in a context of
very high monetary instability—as in Argentina—and stop and go macroeconomic policies
that resulted in sudden swings in relative prices. This instability was also combined with
unstable rules of the game in the design of trade policies. Hence, the literature on Chile argues
there was not a smooth ISI strategy with stellar results in Chile (Cortes Douglas, et al., 1981;
Ffrench-Davis, et al., 2000; Muñoz, 1968).

After describing the policy context and industrial performance in these four countries, we can
focus more close on the heated debates over the nature, causes and limits of industrialization
in Latin America during the ISI period. At least two important issues need to be highlighted.
25

First, the measurement of actual protection to domestic industrial producers is complex, and
its correlation with industrial growth is debated. Second, there is still a heated debate with
regards to what is the right counterfactual for Latin America in the post-WWII period. Did
Latin America industrialize rapidly because of ISI policies or despite of them? That is, there is
still debate about whether industrial growth rates could have been higher if another set of
policies had been implemented.
ISI policies overall effect and industrialization
The contrasting performance between Brazil and Colombia, on the one hand, and Argentina
and Chile on the other raises an interesting puzzle. In order to shed some light on this puzzle
in Figure 1 we show what we call the real distorted import price indices for the four countries.
These are the prices that local producers would observe for competing imports. The index is
the ratio of import prices in the domestic market (in domestic currency) over the domestic
prices. Import prices are calculated by multiplying import prices by the average tariff and the
nominal exchange rate. Domestic prices are measured by the domestic price index for
industrial goods (or the industrial GDP deflator). If the index is higher than 100, local
producers face a protected environment. If the index is below 100, local producers face high
competition from imports (and, during the ISI, macro and trade policies are miss-aligned and
generate more intense competition rather than protection). The index is a useful but
incomplete measure because it considers the effects of quantitative trade restrictions of the
real distorted price index only via its effects over the domestic industrial price index.
Figure 1 shows the log scale of the real distorted import price index. That is, we focus on the
trends rather than on the levels to interpret the evolution of the index for each country. In
Brazil the price distortions induced by macro and trade policies generated increasing
protection to domestic producers up to 1980. In Colombia protection was roughly increasing
between 1950 and 1990. In Argentina it increased up to 1950, and declined thereafter. In
26

Chile, the index declined between 1948 and 1972 and increased thereafter. It is surprising
that the Pinochet government seems to have implemented a set of policies that, although
included substantial trade liberalization, overall tended to protect domestic industrial
producers.
The trends in Figure 1 suggest two important directions for future research. First, to
understand the overall effects of ISI policies it is important to derive synthetic indexes. The
different macro and trade policies implemented during the ISI period generated complex
effects on the economy and it is even possible that the overall effect of these policies was
higher import competition rather than protection. The point is even more important
considering the complex and influential political economy that underlined ISI policies
(influence of trade unions, shifts from left to right, dictatorships, etc.). Second, in our small
sample, when a country sustained more aligned macro and trade policies delivering industrial
protection (as measured by our experimental, albeit limited indicator) for a long period , it
also experienced higher industrial growth rates. Thus, there seems to be suggestive evidence
that increasing protection was indeed associated with increasing industrialization. For
instance, the 1940s-1970s were characterized by convergence in industrial output and
productivity growth and even if not all four countries in our sample experienced faster
industrial output growth than the US, they all had almost twice the U.S. labor productivity
growth.

The Post-WWII Period as a Missed Opportunity
What is not clear to us, however, is if increasing protection led to the highest possible
industrial growth rates or if there were lost opportunities available that South American
countries did not take, but that other countries in similar stages of development took. The
results depicted in Figure 1 above suggest that more distortions are correlated with faster
industrialization in Colombia and Brazil, and to a lesser extent in the case of Chile. Moreover,
convergence to the US could be considered a clear indication of the success of ISI policies. But
how good performance during the golden age of ISI was, and the role that macro and trade
policies played in this performance, is a matter of heated debate.
In East Asia the policy mix during their equivalent of ISI included more incentives for
domestic producers to export and compete in global markets and more targeted tariff
protection. For instance, in South Korea, even if tariff protections were spread around the
28

same sectors as in Argentina or Colombia, they were lower on average—for a shorter time—
and more targeted to promote specific industries or companies (Wade, 1990). The result of
these policies was rapid industrial growth at levels higher than those of the United States. In
fact, manufacturing value added in South Korea grew at an average of 11.2 percent in the postWWII period, and continued at an accelerated pace in the 1980s (above 12 percent per year)
and in the post 1990 period (7.7 percent p.a.).
Comparisons with South Korea suggest we need to improve our knowledge on at least two
directions to understand better Latin America’s experience during ISI. First, part of the
debate is about deciding what the right counterfactual is for Latin America. More precisely, is
convergence to the US enough, or should we develop a measure of potential convergence
speed to judge our countries performance during this period. Convergence to the world
industrial leader may mask slower convergence than potential convergence. The fact that
industrial output in Europe’s industrial leaders, Japan, and South East Asian economies was
growing faster than in Argentina and Chile, in addition to the fact all four countries in our
sample exhibited faster productivity growth in the 1930s than during the golden age of ISI
(except for Argentina), seems to suggest the potential for faster convergence was there but
was not achieved. If this conjecture is correct, our evidence may support the ISI stagnationist
hypothesis. A creative and convincing measure of industrial output and productivity growth is
one of the key inputs to improve our understanding of this period, characterized by one of the
most fascinating policy interventions in Latin America’s history.
Second, there is debate about what was the role played by macro and trade policies in the
observed industrial performance of the four countries in our sample. Using Asia as a
counterfactual would make us question the importance of protectionist policies to promote
industrialization in Latin America. We know that the distorted prices depicted in Figure 1
were high for Brazil and Colombia, and that high protection is correlated with faster
29

industrialization rates. But it is not clear whether in relative terms that made a big difference.
In particular, we know that industry over GDP was larger during this period but, thanks to the
protectionism there were large rents in the protected industries. Thus, value added and our
productivity figures may be inflated by the presence of such rents. With distortions such as
tariff protections come high internal prices that make value added seem higher than if prices
were set in international markets.
Moreover, the distortions governments in South America introduced also affected the capacity
they had for promoting a regional market for manufactures. That is, in contrast with East Asia
where some manufactured products had to be competitive in international markets, the prices
for manufactured goods in Latin America were not competitive in world markets and could
not be exported to neighboring countries because they also wanted to develop its own
industries using a similar policy mix. Thus, according to Badia-Miró, et al. (2014) Latin
America missed important opportunities to spur interregional trade because low productivity
and high trade barriers became major obstacles, especially for intra-regional manufacturing
trade. Interregional integration and industrialization did not progress, despite efforts such as
the 1940 Pinedo Plan, the John Hopkins report of 1944 on the “Cooperación para la
promoción del Intercambio in Argentina,” which proposed the creation of a regional free trade
area, or the Andean Pact between Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.

All in all, until the 1960s, maybe with the exception of Brazil, South American manufacturing
production was mostly destined to satisfy domestic demand. The manufacturing sector in the
region was a net importer, requiring foreign exchange continuously; a situation that cyclically
produced balance of payments crises. But the exclusively inward looking characteristic of the
industry started to change by 1970, when the participation of manufacturing in total exports
increased, governments lowered average tariffs and removed some quantitative restrictions.
Additionally, the creation of the free trade areas of ALADI (1980), to which all four countries
joined, and MERCOSUR (1990), which changed export profile in Argentina and Brazil, and to a
lesser extent Chile, also allowed the region to increase manufacturing exports.
Finally, the timing of de-industrialization also questions the hypothesis that ISI policies led to
a successful industrialization in the region. In the 1970s, all four countries experienced a
deceleration of the industrial average growth rate from four to two percent. That means that
31

de-industrialization, measured as declining share of manufacturing in total GDP, starts for
most countries before their governments dismissed ISI policies and before the crisis of the
1980s. That is, de-industrialization happens not as a consequence of the demise of ISI, but
during the ISI period. De-industrialization starts in Chile in 1971 (while Salvador Allende was
still in power, and before any major change to the ISI policies), and in Argentina and Colombia
by 1975, also before any important departure from ISI programs. Brazil did not do any major
liberalization until the late 1980s and early 1990s. In sum, many of these facts point to a fussy
relationship between protectionism and industrialization.

The 1980s Debt Crisis and its Impact in South America
The 1980s crisis, which started with the spike in interest rates in the United States and the
debt default of Mexico, hit Brazil and Argentina like no other shock in the twentieth century.
During this decade, industrial GDP growth rates decreased across the board, and despite rapid
exchange rate depreciations, domestic industry suffered because of the contraction in
domestic demand and the sudden stop in capital inflows (Frieden, 1991). With low terms of
trade, a sequencing of real devaluations and real appreciations of exchange rates, the reversal
was unavoidable (Berlinski, 2003; Gerchunoff and Llach, 1998). Argentina and Brazil, in fact,
ended up running hyperinflationary policies in the late 1980s, which end up forcing their
governments to open up and to establish fixed exchange rate regimes (in order to anchor
prices). In contrast, Chile and Colombia went through the crisis relatively unscathed, with
moderate macroeconomic imbalances.
Yet, independently of the macroeconomic performance of the country, or the different policies
pursued, manufacturing declined. In all four countries manufacturing output and productivity
growth rates slowed substantially, and manufacturing as a share of GDP accelerated its
decline. Simultaneously, the world leader, the US, and the close followers, the UK, Germany

32

and Japan, all experienced industrial output and productivity growth deceleration. Therefore,
in relative terms Brazil and Colombia managed to catch-up with these industrial leaders,
while Argentina and Chile did not lose as much ground as they could have lost under other
circumstances.
In any case, the 1980s were a turning point for the region. For most countries, the scarcity of
foreign exchange in the early 1980s demonstrated the need for a new development model,
with less balance of payments constraints and with exchange rate stability. That is why, as a
response to the balance of payments crisis and the acceleration of inflation in the region,
governments responded with a drastic liberalization of their economies.

The 1990s and Beyond
The 1990s were a period of rapid structural change, liberalization, and deregulation in our
four countries, with Chile forging ahead with reforms, and Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia
following. Under liberalization we actually observe a rebound from the dismal 1980s, but with
extremely modest rates of growth. The industrial complex in Argentina and Brazil maintained
average growth rates close to two percent, while Chile’s industrial performance improved
substantially, reaching average growth rates of seven percent. The success of Chile in the
1990s stems from the fact that its manufacturing sector gained international competitiveness,
mostly in the so-called extractive industries, but also in some of the medium and high
technology content industries. According to our estimates, the Chilean manufacturing sector is
the best performer of the 1990s and 2000s with an average annual rate of growth of close to 4
percent per year. This may be related to the fact that terms of trade for Chile substantially
improved since 1995, when the government ran a nominal exchange rate crawling peg to
avoid sharp swings in the real exchange rate (Huelva and Núñez, 2010).

33

In the 1990s, Argentina and Brazil institute one-to-one pegs with the dollar. In Argentina, in
fact, the government introduced a currency board to tie the hands of the central bank to avoid
further inflation. In Brazil, the government attempted several stabilization plans between
1985 and 1994, until President Fernando Henrique Cardoso committed to sticking to the Real
Plan, with a new currency and with a series of measures to open up the economy. Despite the
stabilization, both Brazil and Argentina have a slow industrial performance in the 1990s,
partly because the appreciated exchange rate and flat terms of trade.
Colombia experiences its worst decade of the twentieth century in terms industrial growth,
with just over 2% average growth per annum in the 1990s. In this country, while trade and
capital market reform advanced, the oil sector slowly replaced coffee as the main export and
terms of trade improved, and, there was a cycle of appreciation-depreciation-appreciation of
the exchange rate(Clavijo, et al., 2013; Echavarría and Villamizar, 2006).
Finally, during the first decade of the twenty-first century, Brazil, Chile and Colombia
experienced modest average manufacturing growth while Argentina’s output exhibited a
sharp decline and a sharp rebound after 2005. During this period the industrial growth rates
in Chile indicate industrial output catching up with both the US and the group of close
industrial follower countries, while Argentina, Brazil and Colombia do not lose too much
ground with the US and catch-up with the US industrial close followers (see Table 3).
As Table 4 shows, the post 1990s period were not associated with an acceleration of
productivity in the region. Among the countries we study only Chile accelerates productivity
growth, while Argentina, Brazil and Colombia slow down. In fact, when we compare the
growth in labor productivity to that of the United States, we find that South America lagged
behind the industrial leaders during this period. This evidence is supportive of the idea that
there the improvement in terms of trade for the region was actually associated with some
form of Dutch Disease.
34

In contrast to the endogenous industrialization period before World War I, the favorable
terms of trade South America experience in the 2000s, overall the period 1990-2012 period is
not one of rapid industrial convergence. Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia actually
underperform the United States between 1991 and 2007, despite having favorable terms of
trade thanks to high commodity prices booms (especially after 2003). Brazil and Argentina
enjoyed rapid growth in agribusiness-related industries, but only Argentina managed to
convert such favorable terms of trade into rapid manufacturing growth. Brazil, in fact, had a
mediocre industrial performance.

SUMMARY DISCUSSION
In this paper we have compiled and constructed new long-run series of industrial GDP
growth, labor productivity and a set of variables related to initial conditions, international
trade, and macroeconomic policy. In this first attempt we examine what we think are the best
industrial GDP growth series to test qualitatively if these are consistent with hypothesis of 1)
industrialization promoted endogenously by exports via an income effect on the domestic
economy, 2) industrialization under adverse shocks that induce policies promoting
industrialization, 3) import substitution industrialization inducing fast manufacturing
productivity or 4) import substitution industrialization promoting domestic uncompetitive
firms.
Industrial GDP growth series indicate convergence did take place. But convergence was not
experienced during the whole period and its pace was uneven through time and between
countries compared to the world industrial leader, the US, and a group of close followers, the
UK, Germany and Japan.
The initial conditions these countries faced by 1900 were varied and had an important role in
their industrial development along the twentieth century. The Argentine economy was
35

characterized by higher human capital, urbanization and transportation advantages,
compared to the other three countries, and had begun its industrial development earlier.
Brazil’s size was not an advantage at this time. It did not export the diverse raw materials it
was endowed with and the large population was still poor, illiterate and located sparsely and
far from water transport. Strong industrial development only started at the turn of the 20th
century. Chile had access to high human capital and low transport costs, but it was a small and
moderately urbanized economy that industrialized slowly. Colombia’s population was
relatively illiterate, poor, located sparsely and far from water transport. It is the industrial late
comer of this group of countries.
The 1900-1920s was led by Brazil’s strong convergence to the US and its close followers,
while Argentina experienced fast industrial growth but only converged to the industrial close
followers. Although the initial human capital, urbanization, and transport costs favored
Argentina, Brazil performed better. However, in both countries it is likely export growth led to
machinery imports and an income effect that favored industrial growth: endogenous
industrialization. Chile did not catch-up and very likely Colombia experienced similar
performance. The experience of Chile and Colombia contrasts with that of Brazil and
Argentina, even though Chile experienced high exports and favorable initial conditions, while
Colombia also experienced export growth but unfavorable initial conditions.
The roaring twenties were more volatile. Export growth, machinery imports and industrial
growth proceeded at a faster rate in Argentina that caught-up with both the US and the close
industrial followers, but at a slower rate in Brazil that lost ground to the US. Again, it looks like
Argentina and Brazil experienced endogenous industrialization. Chile and Colombia continued
with their sluggish industrial performance, while Colombia invested in railroads and reduced
its disadvantageous initial conditions.

36

The Great Depression was a period of fast industrial growth. The US forged ahead; Brazil,
Chile and Colombia converged to the US followers; and Argentina lost ground. Brazil, Chile
and Colombia performed an initial policy adjustment to the new international conditions,
protecting their own industries. But by mid 1930s, by chance or monopoly policy, saw their
exports grow fast, providing foreign exchange for machinery imports and an income effect
benefiting industrialization. Argentina followed similar policy adjustments, but was unlucky
and did not see exports rise. A combination of adverse shock protective policies with luck or
market power in the international market seems to explain better the fast industrialization of
Brazil, Chile and Colombia.
The ISI period, 1944-1972, saw the four Latin American countries catch-up with the US. Brazil
and Colombia also catch-up with the US close industrial followers, but the four economies
failed to catch-up as fast as south-east Asian industrializing economies like South Korea. The
Latin American economies learned from their experience during the Great Depression and
developed ISI policies. Brazil performed the deepest and longest interventions, while its
population became increasingly literate, urban and richer. Argentina, Chile and Colombia
developed uneven and less distortive policies. Colombians also became increasingly literate,
urban and richer, reducing further the initial disadvantage they faced. ISI policies promoted
further industrialization in all four countries. However, the evidence examined in this chapter
does allow speculating that ISI policies on their own did not have the potential to promote full
catch-up. First, at the beginning of this period Brazil’s industrial GDP per capita signaled it had
as much industrial convergence potential as Argentina and far lower than Chile, but Brazil
performed better than both. The case of Brazil highlights that to implement ISI deeply and for
a long period it is beneficial to have a large domestic market, reduce initial conditions
disadvantages, and be lucky to have export market power and booms. Second, Colombia’s
lower industrial GDP per capita signaled higher convergence potential. Under weaker ISI
37

interventions than Argentina and similar to those of Chile, Colombia grew faster, supported on
important interventions to reduce initial disadvantages, and high coffee prices. Both these
points suggest that at least Argentina possibly developed ISI stagnationinst policies,
inadequate for the unlucky export performance and small capital goods sector that
characterized its economy during this period. Third, the ISI policies seem to have hit their
limit during the late 1960s for Argentina, Chile and Colombia. The manufacturing share of
GDP started declining in all three countries, even before ISI policies had been dismounted –
Brazil kept industrializing and developing more sophisticated manufacturing industries,
probably sheltered under its large market size. Even though evidence tilts to suggest ISI on its
own was not enough to promote industrialization at convergence potential, it is fair to
acknowledge that to assess the role of ISI in industrialization it is necessary to develop
counterfactuals beyond the scope of this chapter.
A period of remarkable industrial and more general instability for Latin America started with
the oil shock and continued during the debt crisis. At differing degrees, all four countries faced
foreign exchange restrictions derived from a large price increase in a key input (oil) or from a
macro crisis (external debt crisis). Industrial growth declined compared to previous periods,
but was not that bad compared to the industrial world leaders. Brazil, Chile and Colombia
converged to the US, and Brazil and Colombia catch-up to the US close industrial followers.
Argentina, however, lost ground to both the US and its followers. But during this period the
manufacturing share of GDP declined in all four countries. De-industrialization continued. The
trend is not unique to these four countries, but it is none the less significant.
The 1990 and 2000s were a period of transitions and export booms. Chile started
dismounting ISI and opening the economy in the late 1970s and the other three countries
followed in the 1990s. Chile enjoyed relative stability during this period and was the only
country to catch-up with the US and its close industrial followers, while Argentina, Brazil and
38

Colombia catch-up with the US followers. The 2000s export booms eased the severe foreign
exchange restrictions of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and under a more open trade
environment and policy in these countries weak convergence was experienced, suggesting
that endogenous industrialization was again in place.
Examination of the industrial GDP growth series uncovers important heterogeneity in
stimulus to industrialization along time, across countries within each period, and in response
to policies adopted. Brazil’s experience highlights the various stimuli that have played a role
in its industrialization: strong endogenous industrialization (1900-1930), adverse shock and
export boom (1930-1944), ISI (1944-1980), and weak endogenous industrialization (19912010). Chile’s failure to catch-up to the US and its close industrial followers in the early stages
of the twentieth century highlights that industrialization by exporting was not automatic even
if many initial conditions had been already achieved. Argentina’s failure to converge during
the decade of fastest convergence in Latin America, the Great Depression, points out that even
if most countries adopt similar policies, some are lucky to export and industrialize, while
others are not. And Colombia’s fast Great Depression and ISI industrial performance
highlights the importance of combining protectionist policies with interventions to reduce
initial conditions disadvantages. This chapter, thus, highlights the importance of considering
the international context, internal policies, initial conditions and the nature of the country’s
export products to understand better industrialization. The point is particularly important for
the literature on Latin America’s industrialization, as it has emphasized analysis of policies
while the importance of these other factors and the heterogeneity between the region
countries’ experience has been downplayed.
Finally, we document a U-shaped curve when it comes to the importance of manufacturing to
GDP in South America. The relative importance of the industrial sector increased rapidly after
the Great Depression, peaking in the 1970s, and then followed a path of relative de39

industrialization. According to what we show, industrialization in most countries required
protectionism and, with a few exceptions, there was a large retrenchment from manufacturing
once the economies of South America started opening up to the world economy and to trade
after the 1990s. We do not argue that the policies that promoted industrialization before 1980
should be tried again. On the contrary, our estimates show the de-industrialization of South
America started before the demise of ISIS. Whatever Latin America tried before 1970, had
short-term success across the board and only in some industries did the region develop longterm comparative advantage.
