ABSTRACT
Following the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the capital-labor (K/L) ratio of China
increased relative to that of India, and, simultaneously, FDI inflows relative to GDP for China
versus India declined. These observations are explained in the context of a simple neoclassical
OLG paradigm. The adjustment mechanism works as follows: the reduction in the growth rate of
the (urban) labor force due to the one-child policy permanently increases the capital per worker
inherited from the previous generation. The resulting increase in China’s (domestic K)/L thus
‘crowds out’ the need for FDI in China relative to India. Our paper is a contribution to the nascent
literature exploring demographic transitions and their effects on FDI flows.

Introduction

This paper explores the in‡uence of population dynamics on relative foreign direct investment
(FDI) ‡ows. We contrast China’s 1982 mandatory one-child policy decree with India, which
initiated a voluntary, but ine¤ective two-child population control program. Viewing the
former as the test case and the latter as the control in a natural experiment, we compare
macroeconomic data from the two countries post 1982. We …nd that the FDI/GDP ratio has
been increasing in both countries but declining in China relative to India.1 We show these
observations to be consistent with a neoclassical adjustment process by replicating them in
a two-country and ‘rest of the world’(ROW) overlapping generations (OLG) model.
The key mechanism in the analysis arises from di¤erential future population growth rates
and, in particular, a sudden, exogenous relative decline in the population growth rate of one
of the two countries. As such, in every generation the national savings of the older age-cohort
in the country with declining population growth accrues to a signi…cantly smaller younger
generation, leading to a comparatively higher capital-labor ratio in that country. This leads
to relatively lower capital returns, thereby discouraging FDI ‡ows into that country. Two
institutional arrangements are key to this result:
1. Home bias in investment …nancing: in either country investment …nancing
needs are …rst satis…ed using domestically generated savings with FDI covering
any shortfall. Indeed, emerging markets economies are usually characterized by
a shortage of domestic investment capital with FDI partially making up the
shortfall.
2. Individual savings rates are una¤ected by fertility: the opportunity to allocate bequest wealth over fewer progeny does not diminish household wealth

accumulation, suggesting that other social phenomena have a dominant role to
play in the determination of the household savings rate.2 Indeed, the literature
focused on the impact of China’s one-child policy on its national savings rate
identi…es an enormous increase in China’s savings rate following the one-child
policy implementation (Choukhmane et al. (2017)).
Various papers o¤er di¤erent explanations for this savings increase, all of a social nature.
Curtis et al. (2015) and Choukhmane (2017) hypothesize that reduced fertility implies fewer
children to support parents in their old age, thereby inducing parents to increase their own
savings. Wei and Zhang (2011) explain the increased savings rate as a competitive response
to the policy-induced sex ratio imbalance: families save more to increase the wealth of their
sons in order to enhance their position in the competition for increasingly scarce spouses.
Imrohoroglu and Zhao (2018) emphasize the long-term care insurance traditionally provided
by families, and how the one-child policy has decreased the ability of families to provide it.
Parents are thus forced to self-insure and do so by saving more. Other relevant work includes
Chamon and Prasad (2010) and Yang et al. (2013). That the savings rate has increased in
China only strengthens the mechanism of this paper. More precisely, the mechanism only
requires that any savings decline due to reduced fertility does not exceed the rate at which
the capital stock per young worker increases.
If capital adjustment costs are present, a model feature we adopt, the same relative FDI
patterns are observed, but over the course of a longer time interval. This does not, however,
alter the nature of the essential mechanism in any way. In addition, and consistent with the
model’s implications, we document that the trajectory of the capital stock growth di¤erences
between China and India closely track the di¤erences in their respective population growth

rates.
This paper is also related to the seminal work of Lucas (1990) which argues that the
neoclassical adjustment process (capital ‡owing to its highest rate of return use) fails to
explain the relative paucity of foreign direct investment in‡ows to poor countries from rich
ones, compared to ‡ows among rich countries themselves, where “rich”and “poor”refer to
countries with high and low capital-labor ratios.3 While our results are not in contradiction
to Lucas (1990), they do suggest that demographic factors may have important consequences
in determining FDI ‡ows.
In summary, the broad message of the paper is two-fold. First, relative population
dynamics play a …rst order role in determining relative cross-country FDI ‡ows. Second,
accounting for these ‡ow dynamics suggests that the post-1982 macroeconomic observations
from India and China are consistent with underlying neoclassical fundamentals.
An outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 documents the relative population dynamics and FDI ‡ows for India and China post China’s implementation of its one child
policy. Sections 3 and 4 present a parsimonious neoclassical international investment model,
the implications of which are shown to replicate the patterns found in the data. Section 5
concludes.

1. In China, an absolute decline in the working population (aged 15-59) began
in 2010 and is predicted to continue under all reasonable scenarios.5
2. With a high degree of con…dence, the working population in India is projected
to continue increasing at least until 2030.
3. After 2025, the working-aged population in India is projected to exceed that
of China.
Figure 1 clearly demonstrates that China’s policy intervention was not only e¤ective
almost immediately after implementation, in contrast to India’s, but also its e¤ects on population dynamics are expected to persist beyond one generation.6 The anticipation of these
persistent policy e¤ects is crucial for investment decisions because investors are forwardlooking and major investments are typically long-lived. The combination of contemporaneous and expected future e¤ects of the one-child policy on these comparative population
dynamics strengthens the impact of the natural experiment.

2.2

Comparative macroeconomic performance

Table 1 presents comparative growth-performance features, such as productivity growth and
GDP growth. These were similar in China and India before and, most especially, after
the exogenous demographic intervention, a similarity that allows us to plausibly attribute
other trend di¤erences between China and India (e.g., relative FDI ‡ows) solely to China’s
Figure 1 documents a continued increase in China’s population for an extended period following the onechild policy initiative. This is due to a gradual increase in policy e¤ectiveness and the gradual elimination
of rural exemptions. For the quantity of relevance to the present study, the working population, one would
expect a delayed reaction due to schooling and work preparation at least to the age of 16. The model to be
proposed captures this decline as occurring in a single 25 year period, which is an artifact of the model’s
parsimony and the choice of a time interval equivalent to 25 years.
6 The recently introduced (2017) two-children policy in China may alter the anticipated population dynamics
in China, depicted in the left panel of Figure 1, after 2030. Nevertheless, predictions about population
dynamics 15 years ahead will not be a¤ected. These predictions are captured later in the time interval
bracketed by the vertical dashed lines.

Both China and India experienced very similar rapid GDP growth in the post implementation (1982-2014) period (see the two columns under “ ” in Table 1).7 Note that labor
productivity growth was also similar in China and India both in Period 1, and even more so
in Period 2 while increasing in both.8 The capital stock grew more rapidly in China in the
latter period, while the dramatic labor force growth slowdown in China is clearly evident in
the “ ”column.

Data as far back as the 1960s and 1970s is presented for comparison purposes only. Both
China and India instituted market economy reforms in 1992. Our competitive model, to be
detailed in Sections 3 and 4, thus provides insights only for the post 1992 period.
For the calculations in Table 1 and the subsequent theoretical analysis, we employ a Cobb-Douglas pro1¬
duction function given by  =  (  )
, where  is GDP,  is capital,  is labor, and  is labor productivity ( is measured as the value of the capital stock and  as total hours worked). The
two columns of Table 1 under “ ”, labor productivity growth, have been calculated using the formula
 = ( ¬  )  (1 ¬ ) ¬  (we have assumed that the capital intensity parameter, = 13 in both
China and India).
8 The similarities in productivity di¤erences between China and India are also supported by Hsieh and
Klenow (2009), and Bollard, Klenow and Sharma (2013).

After the demographic intervention, the K/L ratio of China grew more rapidly than that
of India. During the same period, FDI intensity (measured by FDI as a share of GDP)
grew faster in India than in China. In 1990, the intensity of FDI in China was about 30
times larger than that of India, but by 2014, the intensity of FDI in China was less than 2
times that of India.12 In the remainder of this paper we provide a model to rationalize these

trends of the non-agricultural workforce in both countries (see Figure A.6 and Table A.2 in Online Appendix

purchase of existing domestic capital by foreign entities; observed FDI data predominantly describes the
formation of new capital. This experience contrasts with that of the US where the vast majority of FDI is
for the purchase of claims to already existing capital stock.

The Model

We construct a parsimonious OLG model of two countries, 1 and 2, and the rest of the world
(ROW). We assume that countries 1 and 2 are price takers in international capital markets,
where the ‘world interest rate’, denoted by  , is constant. For simplicity, we elect to focus
on FDI ‡ows from ROW to these two countries. Other key simplifying assumptions are:
- Capital ‡ows from ROW to countries 1 and 2, but there are no capital ‡ows
between countries 1 and 2.
- The labor force of each country cannot move to the other country.
- There is no international trade in …nal goods.13
None of these assumptions is crucial to the model’s implications.

3.1

Production

Aggregate domestic production in country  2 f1 2g in period  is characterized by the
production technology,
 =  +  ,
13 This

(1)

is a simplifying assumption, following Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992) and Holmes, McGrattan
and Prescott (2015). While there are plausible reasons to assume that FDI may be more focused on selling
in a local market rather than as a base for exports (see the discussion in Holmes, McGrattan and Prescott,
2015, p. 1159), this assumption is not critical for the qualitative conclusions implied by the model. Assuming
a fully integrated …nal-goods market would add more arbitrage conditions but would not eliminate the key
arbitrage conditions behind the K/L ratio dynamics studied here. Our empirical application focuses on
China and India, two countries that have, historically, faced both geographical and political barriers to
capital ‡ows and trade.

a foreign …rm to be location-speci…c. Furthermore, technology transfer (as, e.g., in Holmes,
McGrattan and Prescott, 2015), which we do not explicitly model, could cause productivity
to be …rm-speci…c. In each country , we postulate a large number of identical …rms operating

Households, domestic savings, and national capital

We use a simple variant of the overlapping-generations (OLG) model developed in Diamond
(1965). Individuals live for two periods. Omitting subscript , unless necessary, the following
notation applies:
1

consumption of a young agent born at time  ( speci…es the generation)

2

consumption when old at time  + 1 of an individual born at time 



number of individuals born in period  and working in period 



competitive wage received in period 

+1

interest rate paid on savings held from period  to period  + 1.

Aggregate consumption in period  + 1 is thus  2 + +1 1+1 (see below)

We further assume:

1. Within each cohort, individuals are identical. The utility function of a representative individual is given by,
 (1  2 ) = log (1 ) + log (2 ) , with discount factor

2 (0 1) .

(9)

2. Labor supply is completely inelastic and equal to one unit per period. Accordingly, the labor income of an individual when working in period  is  .
3. When young, individuals work, consume and accumulate capital (save). When
old, individuals rent their capital to …rms (in which the young generation works),
consume, and die.
The consumption of generation , when old (occurring in period  + 1), is thus given by,
2 = (1 + +1 )  ,

(10)

where  denotes period  savings of a household (when young). Since the only source of
income when young is the wage income  ,  =  ¬ 1 , and (10) becomes,
1 +

This special case allows the derivation of analytical results with direct empirical implications. Nevertheless, assuming  6=  , and  6=  , gives the same empirical
implications as described below, while depriving us of certain simplifying formulae that follow later in the paper. In what follows, we thus maintain assumption (14).15 See Online
Appendix A for the derivation of expression (15).
Although we make assumptions (namely logarithmic preferences) that lead to a constant
savings rate, all of our qualitative results and testable implications are preserved if the savings
rate is increasing through time. The mechanism on which this paper is based is one where
the declining population means that each generation provides the next with higher capital
per worker, a fact that discourages/crowds-out FDI ‡ows.16 An increased savings rate would
only reinforce the phenomenon we emphasize. Indeed, from 1980-2010 the household savings
rate in China doubled (see, e.g., Imrohoroglu and Zhao, 2018).

the empirical duration of transitions we impose a capital adjustment cost on the dynamics

as due to some combination of industrial relocation costs and institutional adjustment costs
such as bureaucratic frictions.18 These institutional adjustments are gradually smoothed

17 Note

that equation (17) assumes a constant return on capital worldwide and in the countries under study.
A large literature has developed seeking to explain China’s high and stable return on capital of around 20%
in conjunction with the high savings rate (see Bai et al., 2006, and Song et al. 2011). India’s return on
capital is di¢ cult to estimate since much of it is held in non-…nancial assets.
18 The exogenous wedge that we impose upon condition (16) through equations (17) and (18) is similar to
measured wedges that re‡ect deviations from the covered interest rate parity condition observed by Du,
Tepper, and Verdelhan (2017) after the recent …nancial crisis. Du, Tepper, and Verdelhan (2017) attribute
these deviations to costs associated with bank regulation. They can be seen as adjustment costs of moving
from pre-crisis to post-crisis leverage ratios. For some countries, these covered interest rate parity deviations
were stronger during the …nancial crisis crisis and then started fading away over time, as equation (18)
implies (Du, Tepper, and Verdelhan, 2017, Figure 2).

domestic and international markets clear at these equilibrium prices and quantities.
In the model with adjustment costs, equilibrium in country  2 f1 2g is characterized by
conditions (13) and (17), with adjustment costs introducing long-lasting transitions in the
capital labor ratio. In a steady state, adjustment costs are zero by construction.
In the next sections we study the e¤ects of an exogenous demographic intervention on
the equilibrium K/L ratio and FDI. The intervention is characterized by a sudden decrease
in population growth in one of the two countries, similar to what occurred after the introduction of the one-child policy in China. This intervention puts a country in a transition
characterized by changes in its K/L ratio and FDI ‡ows. Speci…cally, following a drop
in population growth, momentum in capital dynamics, exaggerated by capital-adjustment
costs, increases the K/L ratio, which leads to a drop in the marginal product of capital, that,
in turn, discourages FDI in‡ows.
To analyze these e¤ects in detail, we rely on speci…c relationships describing K/L ratio
dynamics both along the transition path toward the steady-state growth path, and along
the steady state growth path itself. These are presented below:
a) Transition Dynamics

18

in the growth rate of domestic capital, absent changes in labor productivity growth.

b) Steady State Growth Dynamics ( ( ) = 0)
We maintain our assumption that population growth is constant and further assume that
productivity growth is also constant over time in country  2 f1 2g, i.e.,

Model Implications

The goal of this paper is to emphasize the role played by the one-child policy in China
in explaining the comparative FDI/GDP dynamics in China and India. Explaining the
precise trajectories of the FDI/GDP levels in China and India, especially the very low
FDI/GDP levels of the early 1980s, when neither of the two countries were market economies,
is a challenge that requires introducing market and trade wedges, something we eschew.
Accordingly, we focus on the post 1990 period, when both China and India displayed robust
FDI/GDP ratios and almost free access to international markets. For this period the role of
demographics in explaining the comparative FDI trajectories in China and India should be
transparent.20
In particular, we study a parametrized version of the model where an exogenous demographic intervention occurs in period 10. The length of each period is  = 25. The annual
rate of time preference is (1 ¬ ) = = 6%. The annual labor productivity growth rate is
 = 4%, a rough average of the data summarized in Table 1. For the treated country,
the annual population growth rate prior to the intervention is  = 2%, and ~ = ¬1%
afterwards. For the control country it is 2% throughout. The output elasticity of capital

shown in Table 1, the productivity di¤erences between China and India have been very small. This
similarity allows us to focus on the comparative e¤ects caused by the exogenous intervention in the population

Relative growth in capital and labor

Since India’s demographic-control policies were broadly ine¤ective and it was exposed to the
same globalization factors as China (especially in the mid-1990s), we postulate that India
remained close to its steady-state path, and examine the di¤erence in the capital growth
rate between the two countries. In particular, equation (20) can be re-written as,
 =

4.2

The impact of an exogenous demographic intervention on relative FDI dynamics

In this section we focus on FDI, speci…cally the trajectories of capital in‡ows from ROW.
It is assumed that both countries are identical as regards their initial K/L ratio and have
identical labor productivity growth rates before and after the intervention.
Using the parameter values detailed in the previous section, Figure 7 depicts modelgenerated di¤erences between one country experiencing an exogenous period-10 demographic
intervention, and a country on its steady-state path. Panels A, C and E describe the consequences for the treated country while Panels B, D and F compare its response to the
intervention with the corresponding quantity in the control country.
First consider Panels A and B of Figure 7.24 Following the demographic intervention, the
K/L ratio of the treated country spikes up (Panel A) before returning to its long run steady
state value.25 As a result, the K/L ratio in the treated country increases relative to the
control country as captured in Panel B.26 After some generations, the e¤ect disappears, with
the K/L ratio in both countries identical once again (Panel B) as required by their identical
productivity growth rates. The K/L ratio e¤ects are directly re‡ected in the corresponding
MPK values: the abrupt increase in the treated country’s K/L ratio has its counterpart in an
absolute reduction in its MPK (Panel C), and a relative MPK reduction vis-a-vis the control
country (Panel D). Following equation (18), adjustment costs of industrial relocation, and
assess the implications of Figure 7, the reader is again reminded that if we consider two time series, 
and  , and plot log ( ) ¬ log ( ) over time, then an upward-sloping log ( ) ¬ log ( ) implies that  grows
faster than  .
25 As stressed above, in equation (19), capital in e¢ ciency units,  (), is tied to the world interest rate,
 . In order to better understand the dynamics of K/L ratios we need to control for changes in the dynamics
of labor productivity, , which we plot in Panel A of Figure 7 as  ().
26 Following the identi…cation mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the K/L ratio in the treated country
grew relative to its equivalent in the control country.
24 To

23

institutional adjustments such as bureaucratic frictions are manifested in a temporary drop
in capital returns, driven by the capital-returns wedge,
over time. Our choice of parameter

( ) =

(1 ¬ )¬ ¬1 , that decays

is an annual rate of 05%, and the decay parameter

= 03 implies that the half-life of this interest-rate wedge

is about 50 years, which

corresponds to two generations of young workers (T=25 years). These values of

and

reproduce empirically plausible K/L ratio dynamics.

Figure 7 – Comparative time paths of K/L, MPK and FDI/GDP, for the two economies
around the time of the demographic intervention (treatment for one country only).

24

Panels E and F detail the consequences of the intervention for the FDI/GDP ratio of the
treated country. As evident in equation (25), the steady state FDI/GDP ratio of country
 is positively related to its population growth rate  . Accordingly, a reduction in the
treated country’s  reduces its FDI/GDP ratio, an e¤ect manifested in Panel E. Relative
to the control country, its FDI/GDP ratio declines as well (Panel F): although the K/L
ratio of the treated country eventually returns to its pre-intervention values (Panel A), the
composition of its ownership of its capital stock has changed in favor of proportionately
less FDI. We summarize these model implications as follows: a permanent decline in the
population growth rate of the treated country leads to, (i) a temporary, though prolonged,
increase in the K/L ratio above its steady state value, (ii) a temporary, though prolonged,
decrease in the marginal product of capital below its steady state value, and (iii) a permanent
reduction in its FDI/GDP ratio both absolutely and relative to its control counterpart. Note
that Panel A of Figure 7 depicts the time path of the normalized (by labor productivity, )
K/L ratio. The K/L ratio of both countries, except on the transition path for the treated
country, thus continues to grow at the same growth rate as .
The permanent decline in the relative FDI/GDP ratio following a permanent reduction in
the treated country’s population growth rate (Figure 7, Panel F) is not due to the temporarily
lower marginal product of capital (Figure 7, Panel D) and thus lower capital returns. We
emphasize that it is not the (temporarily) lower capital returns that discourage FDI. Rather,
less FDI is needed since greater capital per worker is being inherited from the prior generation
due to the reduction in the population growth rate in an environment where the savings rate
is unchanged.27 It is a “crowding-out”type e¤ect. Model dynamics are thus in accord with
data (Figure 5).
27 These

results are robust to a reduced savings rate response to fewer descendants in a model of implicit
voluntary bequests, provided the savings rate decline is not too great.

25

We present further evidence (Figure 8) in support of the ‘crowding out’ mechanism
resulting from China’s one child policy on FDI by exploring FDI as a share of domestic
investment (FDI/I ratio) in China and India for the period 1982-2014.

Figure 8 - FDI/I ratio in China and India
Prior to 1992, the FDI/I ratio was low in China and negligible in India. This is evident from
Figure 8. While India’s FDI/I ratio is generally increasing in the years following 1992, the
pattern for China is one of an initial dramatic increase, followed by a pronounced general
decline. A major reason for the initial increase in China’s FDI/I ratio is easily identi…ed.
In 1992 the Chinese government formally established “market economy reforms”in its constitution and began to strengthen private property rights by enforcing the “rule of law”for
commercial transactions. As a landmark on China’s transition to a market economy, these
reforms made China a dramatically more attractive place for foreign investment.28 While
28 The

second landmark year, 2001, marked China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).

26

the observed decline in China’s FDI/I ratio is theoretically consistent with the perspective
of this paper –the “crowding out”of FDI by increases in China’s K/L due to demographic
repression – it may also be due to the dramatic increases in China’s domestic household
savings rate in this period (see Choukhmane et al. (2017)), a feature absent in the present
model formulation. As noted earlier, however, introducing an increasing savings rate would
only strengthen the model’s prediction of a declining FDI/I ratio.
In summary, our theoretical predictions are as follows:
1. After a permanent drop in a country’s population growth rate its FDI/GDP
ratio will steadily decline to a new, permanently lower, level (see Figure 7, Panel
E, and equation (25)).
2. After a permanent drop in a country’s population growth rate, its FDI/I ratio
will similarly decline to a new, permanently lower, level.
In Figure 8, China’s FDI/I ratio does decline with time, in accordance with the theoretical
predictions. In Figure 3, however, China’s FDI/GDP ratio is seen to stabilize at around 4%,
a seeming contradiction to the theory presented here.
We attribute this discrepancy to other factors at play, and, in particular, labor productivity growth. Speci…cally, Table 1 portrays a dramatic increase in China’s productivity growth
in the decades following 1982. Moreover, equation (25) implies a positive steady-state relationship between the FDI/GDP ratio and labor productivity growth. Taken together, these
facts suggest that China’s enhanced productivity growth post 1982, per se, would lead to
a higher FDI/GDP ratio, and that this e¤ect may overwhelm the opposing force of lower
population growth emphasized in the present paper. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the
FDI/GDP pattern evident in Figure 3 is the result of the e¤ects of higher productivity
growth and lower population growth counterbalancing one another.
27

Nevertheless, the fact that productivity growth was similar in China and India after 1982
allows us also to focus on comparative FDI/GDP dynamics between China and India. On
Figure 4 we have focused on these comparative FDI/GDP dynamics, empirical observations
that are replicated theoretically in Figure 7 (Panel F).

5.

Relationship to the existing literature

The neoclassical foundation for dynamic FDI analysis was …rst articulated in McGrattan and
Prescott (2009, 2010), and Holmes, McGrattan and Prescott (2015). These three studies introduce international capital ‡ows in a fashion similar to the present model. The paradigms
they consider assume that both population growth rates and labor-productivity growth rates
are equal across countries (see McGrattan and Prescott, 2010, p. 1503, and Holmes, McGrattan and Prescott, 2015, p. 1172), an assumption necessary for the existence of steady states
in their formulations.29 In these papers both developed and developing countries have the
same population growth, suggesting that developing countries catch up with the world production frontier mainly through capital deepening. Alternatively, the concept of “technology
transfer” in McGrattan and Prescott (2009, 2010), and Holmes, McGrattan and Prescott
(2015) represents another appropriate technique for analyzing, e.g., the post-World-War II
transition of southern European economies toward the EU frontier.
From a pure demographic perspective, Backus et al. (2014) and Cooley and Henriksen
(2018) are two additional works. In the former, the authors directly explore the implications
29 To

see why this paradigm does not allow for steady states with heterogeneous rates of population growth
across countries, consider an intertemporal Euler equation relating the growth rate of consumption to a
constant world interest rate,  . With constant relative risk aversion , this Euler equation is given by

+1  = [ (1 +  )] , with  being consumption in country . With ^ denoting consumption in e¢ ciency

units is impossible for all countries if population growth rates are heterogeneous. Other steady states are
impossible, as well.

of di¤ering population dynamics (life expectancies, population age distributions) for capital
‡ows between countries. In the latter work the focus is more on the implications of population
dynamics for economic growth rates within countries, particularly Japan and the US. The
mechanism we have emphasized, however, is not showcased in these papers.
The present paper is also a contribution to the growing literature studying savings and
investment in China. Bai et al. (2006) were the …rst to document the high capital returns
in China (exceeding 20% post 1993) carefully. They conclude that China’s high investment
rate is consistent with the observed high returns. Song et al. (2011) explore the seeming
contradiction implicit in China’s simultaneous high capital returns and high capital out‡ows.
Their model rests on the internal reallocation of capital out of low growth …rms that are
large, externally …nanced, and whose capital needs are low. In contrast, high growth, high
productivity …rms are small and subject to capital constraints. They thus …nance their
rapidly increasing investments out of internally generated funds alone. As a result, the
surplus capital from low growth …rms migrates abroad, while the relative growth in the high
productivity …rms allows high overall capital returns to be observed.30 Nothing in the present
model depends on the precise level of capital returns. The large literature that studies the
impact of China’s one-child policy on its national savings rate was noted in the introduction.
Finally, the ability of the model to replicate the facts depicted in Figure 3 does not
contradict the Lucas paradox per se: FDI/GDP and K/L were higher in China compared
to India throughout the entire sample period.31 It does suggest, however, that the search
30 A

more recent study also reporting high capital returns in China and focusing on the link between these
returns and the housing boom in China, is Chen and Wen (2017).
31 The present model is also able to replicate the Lucas (1990) paradox as a potential competitive equilibrium
outcome. To see this, …rst note that by equation (24), the level of labor productivity,  , in‡uences the
K/L ratio. By equation (25), however, the level of labor productivity has no in‡uence on the steady state
FDI/GDP ratio. Imagine two countries, one with a lower  , a higher level of capital intensity  , and
higher labor force and labor productivity growth rate. By equation (25) this country will have the higher
steady-state FDI/GDP ratio ( and being common to both countries). If this country simultaneously
enjoys labor productivity  dramatically above its counterpart, this high FDI/GDP ratio country will also

by exploring cross-country relative rather than absolute FDI dynamics.32

Conclusion

This paper is a contribution to the nascent literature on the role of FDI and technology
transfer in international markets in the context of integrated capital markets (see McGrattan
and Prescott, (2009, 2010), and Holmes, McGrattan and Prescott, (2015)). We emphasize
the e¤ects of cross-country heterogeneity in population growth on relative FDI ‡ows, a
topic not previously addressed in that literature. More speci…cally, the mandatory one-child
policy in China is contrasted with India’s comparatively laissez faire approach as a natural
experiment to test for the presence of neoclassical FDI dynamics. Our evidence and analysis
support the hypothesis that neoclassical fundamentals do govern relative FDI ‡ows.
As in the literature cited above, we employ a straightforward OLG construct for our
analysis, and focus on studying temporary, though prolonged departures from steady states.
For emerging markets, real-world transitional dynamics which are far from the steady state,
can be quite complicated, suggesting that the assumption of household perfect foresight may
be too strong. The “myopia” (beyond an adult’s life span of, e.g., 50-60 years) of an OLG
model however, is perhaps the more appropriate starting point for capturing the rules of
thumb used by savers in emerging economies.

have a higher (K/L). Accordingly, more capital ‡ows from the ROW to the richer of the two countries, where
we measure wealth in terms of capital per worker. This is one version of the Lucas (1990) paradox in our
neoclassical setting.
In fact, the high FDI/GDP, high  country described above resembles the USA in many respects: a
country with a high absolute TFP level, high TFP growth by developed world standards, a high income
share to capital and low savings (low ).
32 Notably, this natural experiment could not showcase these mechanics back in 1990, when the Lucas-paradox
paper was written.

Foreign Direct Investment1
We use four different data sources to cross-verify the FDI inflows and outflows of China and India.
1. OECD: 1990-2013. Historic time series from OECD FDI statistics to end-2013
(http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/fdi-statistics-according-tobmd3.htm).
2. National Accounts: 1982 – 2014. National Bureau of Statistics China (NBS-China) provides FDI
outflow and inflow information (http://data.stats.gov.cn/english/index.htm).
3. UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development): 1981-2013.The UNCTAD work
program on FDI Statistics documents and analyzes global and regional trends in FDI.
4. DataStream: 1981-2016 (Quarterly). Thomson Reuters DataStream provides quarterly data on FDI
inflows and outflows for China and India.2
Population Estimates and Forecasts: 1950-2100. United Nations: probabilistic population projections based
on the world population prospects (the 2015 revision)3.
GDP Series: 1990-2014, 2015-2018 (estimates). Work Bank, PPP adjusted at constant 2011 international
USD.
Capital Stock -GDP ratio (K/Y ratio): PWT 9.0 (The Penn World Table).

FDI data come from four sources: (a) National Accounts, (b) OECD, (c) Datastream, and (d) UNCTAD. These
sources cover different years, so we specify which we use in each context and document the correlation among
these data sources. National account data for India is downloaded from the RBI website
(https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/SDDSView.aspx) and it is identical to the data provided by OECD. So, we only
report the OECD source.

All FDI statistics from different sources use 2010 USD as the base dollar value.
The quarterly data sources are composed by Oxford Economics (http://www.oxfordeconomics.com/).

Figure A.1
The sources used in the paper are National-accounts data for the period 1982-2014 and Datastream data for
years 2015-2016. National-accounts data and Datastream data overlap over the period 1982-2014 with a
correlation coefficient of 99.79%.

Figure A.2
The sources used in the paper are National-accounts data for the period 1982-2014 and Datastream data for
years 2015-2016. National-accounts data and Datastream data overlap over the period 1982-2014 with a
correlation coefficient 99.99%.

Figure A.3
The sources used in the paper are UNCTAD data for the period 1981-2013 and Datastream data for years
2014-2016. UNCTAD data and Datastream data overlap over the period 1981-2013 with a correlation
coefficient of 92.56%. The reason we have chosen UNCTAD data for the period 1981-2013 is because, (a)
for the period between 1981 and 1989 Datastream reports zero values (but not missing values), and (b) the
two data sources overlap over the period 1991-2013 with a correlation coefficient of 99.87%.

Figure A.4
The sources used in the paper are UNCTAD data for the period 1981-2013 and Datastream data for years
2014-2016. UNCTAD data and Datastream data overlap over the period 1981-2013 with a correlation
coefficient of 89.32%. The reason we have chosen UNCTAD data for the period 1981-2013 is because, (a)
for the period between 1981 and 1993 Datastream reports zero values (but not missing values), and
(b) the
two data sources overlap over the period 1994-2013 with a correlation coefficient of 99.86%.

Figure A.6
To address the concern that large-scale internal migration in China would decrease the capital-labor ratio
instead of increasing it, we use the urban population, restricted to ages 15-64 and perform a robustness check.
Figure A.5 shows that the linear time trend coefficient (of the log K/L ratio of China over the K/L ratio of
India) is positive and statistically significant (not equal to 0 with p-value at 0.3%). In Figure A.6 where we
plot a similar data series as Figure 5 (in the paper) using this restricted sample, all the quantitative results
remain.

The first two columns of Table A.2 provide the data appearing in Figure A.6 (without the logarithmic
conversion of ratios). The last two columns of Table A.2 are the two new urban (working) population series
appearing in Figure A.6.
