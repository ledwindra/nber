Price Dividend Ratio Factors : Proxies for Long Run Risk
Ravi Jagannathan and Srikant Marakani
NBER Working Paper No. 17484
October 2011, Revised August 2013
JEL No. G11,G12
ABSTRACT
We evaluate the empirical support for a broad class of long run risk models using information in factors
extracted through principal component analysis of the covariance matrix of log price dividend ratios
of twenty five equity portfolios formed on Size and Book-to-Market. We identify two price-dividend
ratio factor proxies for economy wide long run risk, one tracking the volatility of the growth rate in
economy wide aggregate consumption, and the other predicting the growth rates in the stock index
portfolio dividends and aggregate consumption, consistent with the implications of these models.
We show that that the long run risk factor driving expected consumption growth is not recoverable
from the cross section of excess returns alone. The price dividend ratio factors perform better than
the stock index price dividend ratio and the corporate yield spread, and has information in addition
to what is in the slope of the term structure of interest rates, in forecasting the growth rate in real time
consumption and stock index dividends. The covariance of excess returns with factor innovations explain
the cross section of excess returns on size, book/market, earnings/price ratio, long term reversal, and
short term reversal sorted portfolios in a manner robust to look-ahead and useless factor biases. Our
findings suggest that the widely used Fama and French (1993) three factor model and the long run
risk models studied in the literature are not necessarily inconsistent with each other. They may be
representing the same underlying phenomenon, but emphasizing different aspects of reality.

Introduction

Recent research in asset pricing has focused on models of dynamic economies in order to provide
a better understanding of the underlying economic forces behind various empirical regularities
observed in financial markets. Three of the empirical regularities that have received particular
attention in the literature are the high historical average risk premium on corporate equities
(Mehra and Prescott 1985), large cross sectional variation in historical average returns across
various asset classes (Fama and French 1992) (Fama and French 1995) and low risk free rate
(Weil 1989).
Among the various representative agent consumption based models that have been proposed
for explaining these patterns, three have received wide attention: the external habit formation
model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999), the rare disasters model of Rietz (1988) and Barro
(2006) and the long run risk model of Bansal and Yaron (2004).1 Lettau and Wachter (2007)
and Santos and Veronesi (2009) argue that it is difficult to reconcile the external habit formation
model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) with the value premium. Gabaix (2008) and Gourio
(2008) point out that there is little evidence that value and growth stocks have differential
exposure to disaster risk and therefore rare disaster models will have difficulties in explaining
the value premium puzzle.
The evidence for the long run risk model has been mixed. On the one hand, Bansal, Yaron,
and Kiku (2007), Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2005), Bansal, Dittmar, and Kiku (2009),
Malloy, Moskowitz, and Vissing-Jørgensen (2009) and Da (2009) find that long run risk models
can explain the cross section of stock returns. On the other hand, the studies of Beeler and
Campbell (2012), Marakani (2009), Ferson, Nallareddy, and Xie (2012), Constantinides and
Ghosh (2008) and others either dispute the interpretation of the results of the former studies

Asset pricing models can also be written on the basis of production and productivity shocks as in (Zhang
2005). Since our focus is on consumption based representations, we do not examine production based models.

2

and/or find other empirical evidence casting doubt on the ability of long run risk models to
explain the cross section of stock returns.
The mixed empirical support may be in part due to the use of per capita aggregate consumption as a proxy for the consumption of the marginal investor in empirical studies of the
long run risk models. There is some evidence suggesting that the consumption of shareholders
may be a better proxy. For example, Malloy, Moskowitz, and Vissing-Jørgensen (2009) find
that shareholders’ consumption risk explains the cross section of stock returns better than
the risk associated with aggregate per capita consumption. The difficulty is that shareholder
consumption data is available for a shorter length of time and may exhibit non-stationarities
as documented by Parker and Vissing-Jorgensen (2010).2 He and Krishnamurthy (2008) and
Adrian, Etula, and Muir (2011) take the stand that financial intermediaries are more likely to
consistently be at the margin in securities markets and their consumption and wealth changes
may be more relevant for explaining variations in security prices over time and in the cross
section.
We therefore assume that the marginal investors’ equilibrium consumption evolves according to a long run risk process of a form similar to that proposed by Bansal and Yaron (2004),
without imposing the restriction that aggregate per capita consumption is a good proxy for
the marginal investors’ consumption. We show that the long run risk factors in this model
economy are also the factors affecting temporal evolution of the log price to dividend ratios of
stocks. Using this fact, the long run risk factors can be estimated through principal component
analysis of the covariance matrix of log price to dividend ratios of a collection of stocks. We
assume that it is reasonable to ignore the term involving the marginal investors’ contempora2
Parker and Vissing-Jorgensen (2010) find that the relation between the consumption of high income households, which is a good proxy for shareholder consumption, and aggregate consumption and income fluctuations
is non-stationary and exhibits large changes after 1980. Malloy, Moskowitz, and Vissing-Jørgensen (2009) overcome the short data series by extrapolating the shareholder consumption data by using it’s projection on other
variables but this procedure assumes that the relationships are stationary.

neous consumption growth in the asset pricing relation that we derive, since the state variables
and their innovations explain the bulk of the risk premium in the long run risk model.3
We use price dividend ratio factors rather than return factors in our analysis as the use
of the former enables us to directly estimate the slow moving long run risk state variables.
Therefore, their use allows us to test the model implied relationship between these factors
and the macroeconomic variables of interest. This would not be possible with only study
of the return factors as we show that they do not contain information about the expected
consumption/dividend growth factors in the long run risk model. We verify this empirically by
showing that this factor, estimated using our methodology, drives out the Fama-French factors
in predictive regressions of these quantities.
We also find and clarify the relationship between the asset pricing relations implied by
both these methodologies. This relationship implies that, under certain assumptions, both
asset pricing relations are approximately equivalent. This finding provides an explanation for
the good performance of the Fama-French three factor model as it implies that the latter is
approximately equivalent to the price dividend ratio factor model for asset pricing purposes.
Our methodology does not focus on a particular parametric version of the long run risk
model, and does not require projecting the future consumption growth and its volatility on
the log market price to dividend ratio and the real risk free rate to estimate the long run
risk factors as in (Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku 2007), (Constantinides and Ghosh 2008) and
(Ferson, Nallareddy, and Xie 2012). This is an advantage since both consumption growth and
the real risk free rate are measured with considerable error. As we show using Monte Carlo
simulations, this error could be large enough to result in the rejection of the long run risk
model too often even when it holds. The disadvantage is that our method will have a lower

While the marginal investors’ consumption might not be directly observable, it is likely to be positively
correlated with measures of aggregate consumption growth. We find that the inclusion of aggregate consumption
growth in the empirical analysis does not significantly change our results.

power if the particular parametric model that Constantinides and Ghosh (2008) consider is
indeed the right one.
We find that the cross section of average excess returns on several well diversified portfolios
are consistent with long run risk models where the long run risk state variables are adequately
represented by the two log price dividend ratio factors that we identify using this approach.
While this result alone is consistent with a variety of asset pricing models, we also find that
the two factors predict future aggregate consumption and dividend growth as well as track
contemporaneous consumption growth volatility. This is consistent with long run risk models
under the assumption that the factors that affect the consumption of the marginal investor
also affects aggregate consumption. Our findings provide some evidence against standard time
separable power utility based representative agent models. However, we can not rule out
representative agent models with alternative preferences or models where agents have time
separable power utility but face decision making costs as in (Jagannathan and Wang 2007)
and (Jagannathan, Marakani, Takehara, and Wang 2012). These conclusions are robust to
the recent critique of factor models by Kleibergen (2010) and the look ahead bias critique of
Ferson, Nallareddy, and Xie (2012).
This enables an answer to one of the important critiques of the long run risk model raised
by Beeler and Campbell (2012). Beeler and Campbell (2012) point out that the log market
price dividend ratio does not predict dividend or consumption growth. We show that a price
dividend ratio factor does predict both dividend growth a real time measure of consumption
growth. This does not show up in the log market price dividend ratio as the market price
dividend ratio weights most strongly on the volatility price dividend ratio factor.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our version of the long
run risk model which encompasses the ones of Bansal and Yaron (2004), Bansal, Yaron, and
Kiku (2007) and Zhou and Zhu (2009). Section 3 discusses the implication of the model for
the factor structure of log price to dividend ratios and asset pricing. Section 4 describes the

5

data. Section 5 develops the econometric specifications and discusses the empirical findings.
Section 6 concludes.

The Long Run Risk Model

Our main aim is to use a model which is flexible enough to encompass a large range of long run
risk models extant in the literature while retaining and emphasizing the core assumptions of the
framework which are that there are common persistent components of expected consumption
and dividend growth and persistent components of volatility. We model the dividends of
individual well diversified portfolios as in (Hansen, Heaton, and Li 2008) and (Kiku 2006).
The relative advantages of this approach are discussed in detail by Bansal, Dittmar, and Kiku
(2009).
We consider the following long run risk model which accommodates the specifications proposed by Bansal and Yaron (2004), Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2007) and Zhou and Zhu (2009)
as special cases.4 Let c, Xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n and Vj , 1 ≤ j ≤ m be the log consumption process,
n processes that determine it’s conditional growth rate and m processes that determine the
volatility of it’s conditional growth rate respectively. Let dl , l ≤ 1 ≤ L be the log dividend
processes of L portfolios (in general, the lower case variables correspond to the logarithm of
the upper case variables). We assume that these quantities follow the processes

analysis.

necessary to ensure that the market volatility is decoupled from the consumption growth
volatility as is the case in the data). The basic time interval of the process is assumed to be
the same as that for which consumption is observed. This ensures that the stochastic discount
factor can be related to the innovations in the processes c, X and V . If the basic time interval
of the process is smaller than that for which consumption is observed, time aggregation effects
prevent the calculation of the stochastic discount factor as shown by Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku
(2007) as the true innovations cannot be recovered from the observed data. We note that at
least some of the αi and νi must be small for the risks to be long lived and carry a high price.
In the above equations, consumption is defined as a rate rather than per period so that
consumption from time t to t + ∆t is Ct+∆t ∆t and log consumption from t to t + ∆t is
ct+∆t + log ∆t. While this generally makes no difference as the log consumption is just offset
by a constant, it ensures that the continuous time limit exists and (as we show in appendix
A) also makes it easy to obtain it. It further shows that the solution method of Bansal and

7

Yaron (2004) is general enough to apply to continuous time models. One consequence of this
definition is that the log-linearization constants depend on ∆t. This is due to the fact that
consumption and dividends are flow variables whose magnitude depend on the time interval
(the shorter the time interval, the smaller the consumption and dividend). This fact implies
that the log-linearization constants, which are functions of the average wealth to consumption
or price to dividend ratio, are inversely related to the time scale. This explains the dependence
of these log-linearization constants, and hence the market prices of risk, on the time unit chosen
in the formulae below.5
This long run risk process, when written in continuous time, incorporates the one proposed
by Zhou and Zhu (2009) as a special case (specifically with n = 1, m = 2 and ϕw,i = 0, 1 ≤ i ≤
m). When the volatility process (3) is modified to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck one plus a constant
P
by modifying the second term to σi,w ∆Zi,t+1 and the final term in (1) to − m
k=1 ϕw,k (Zk,t+∆t −
Zk,t ), it incorporates the ones proposed by Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Bansal, Yaron, and
Kiku (2007) as special cases (specifically with n = 1, m = 1, ϕw,i = 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, πi,l,x =
0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ L and πi,l,w = 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ l ≤ L).
We now look more closely at the dividend growth specification (4) in this formulation. Most
importantly, we note that the embedded assumption in (4) that the expected dividend growth
of all the portfolios depends on the same set of state variables X that determine expected
consumption growth is not essential but convenient. In general, we can make the expected
dividend growth depend on more AR(1) state variables Y so that

The innovations of these state variables Y which are unrelated

This makes a small contribution as the solution method of Bansal and Yaron (2004) is simpler than the
continuous time solution method used by Zhou and Zhu (2009)

price of risk and this can be empirically examined. A more intuitive way to think about
this is to interpret the restriction of using a single set of state variables to determine both
expected quantities as a criterion for the choice of portfolios to use. In other words, we want
to choose portfolios whose characteristics are related to future consumption growth. To do
so effectively, we use the studies of Parker and Julliard (2005) and Malloy, Moskowitz, and
Vissing-Jørgensen (2009) to help pin-point assets whose cross-sectional variation is related to
future consumption growth. Once the choice is made, the extra restrictions on any identified
state variables corresponding to Y can then be examined.6
Menzly, Santos, and Veronesi (2004) develop an alternative way of modeling the process
for aggregate dividends starting from the process for the dividends of individual firms in an
economy. While attractive for theoretical analysis, the disadvantage in empirical studies is that
it ignores investment which, as shown by Bansal, Dittmar, and Kiku (2009), plays a major
part in linking the aggregate stock market dividends to the dividends paid out by individual
firms.

As noted by Bansal and Yaron (2004), we need γ > 1/ψ to generate a positive equity risk
premium as expected dividend growth is positively related to expected consumption growth
(as noted by Bansal and Yaron (2004), Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2007), Bansal, Dittmar,
and Lundblad (2005), Bansal, Dittmar, and Kiku (2009) and others). This implies that they
prefer early resolution of uncertainty and that shocks to expected consumption growth carry a
positive price of risk (as pointed out by Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2010)) which is high if
the expected consumption growth is persistent. This high price of risk results in a high equity
premium and low risk-free rate.

With our choice of portfolios, we do not find any state variables or factors of this type.

Factor structure of log P/D ratios

by Bansal and Yaron (2004), Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2007) and Zhou and Zhu (2009) to the
situation when there are multiple state variables describing predictable consumption growth
and consumption growth volatility. If additional state variables Y are needed in determining
the dividend growth, (7) changes to

The expression for αv,j is complicated

and does not directly concern us here, but we note that it was shown by Bansal and Yaron
(2004) that αv,j < 0 if γ − 1/ψ > 0 and ψ > 1.
The relatively simple form of λx,i implies that it can be used together with a reasonable
approximation for 1−ν1 =

exp(c−w)∆t
1+exp(c−w)∆t

≈ exp(c − w)∆t to estimate γ −1/ψ once a component

Xi is identified. The estimation of ν1 , which can at best be done heuristically, is a cost that
has to be paid when the parameters are not explicitly specified. It must be cautioned that
while this estimate is likely to be imprecise due to it’s indirect nature, it is still useful in that
it allows to relate the empirical results back to the underlying preferences.
In the case of no measurement error, (7) can be inverted to express the state variables
(Xi , Vj ) as a linear combinations of log P/D ratios. This enables the expression of the log
stochastic discount factor as

Note that the value of αx,i depends on ∆t but the risk premium does not. αx,i varies inversely with ∆t as
1 − ν1 is proportional to ∆t. Since the risk premium due to this risk is given by the product of αx,i and the
covariance between the return and the innovation to Xi which is proportional to ∆t, the inverse relationship
between αx,i and ∆t implies that the risk premium is independent of it.

where Fi and IFi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n + m are the n + m principal components of the log P/D ratios (or,
equivalently, any linear combination of n+m log P/D ratios) and their innovations respectively.
(7) implies that the log P/D ratios of assets follow a strict factor structure (up to the
loglinear approximation) in the model.8 Since log P/D ratios are not exact linear combinations
of a small number of factors in the data, we use a slightly modified relation in our empirical
work. This relation is

where l,t ∼ N (0, Ve ) are i.i.d. l,t can be thought of as deviations that arise due to market
imperfections such as illiquidity or due to the existence of incompletely diversified idiosyncratic

analysis (or singular value decomposition) can be used to estimate the linear subspace that the
n + m factors span once n + m is specified and that statistical tests suggested in the literature
can be used to estimate n + m from the data.
This differs from the methodology used by Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2007) and Ferson,
Nallareddy, and Xie (2012) in estimating the linear subspace of the factors with the use of several log P/D ratios rather than the projection of the realized long term consumption growth
and its volatility on the log market P/D ratio and the real risk free rate. We show in appendix C, by using Monte Carlo simulations of the long run risk model, that our methodology
produces much fewer spurious rejections of the model when reasonable measurement errors in
consumption growth and the real risk free rate are taken into account.

and (11) (with ∆t set to 1).
We empirically evaluate the asset pricing relation in equation (14) using cross sectional
regressions and GMM. The cross sectional regression results are particularly useful in relating our results to those in the literature that use various linear beta pricing representations.
The appropriate pricing relations for the cross sectional regressions are developed in the next
section. In contrast, the GMM results directly examine the nonlinear pricing relationship (14).

3.1

The Linear Beta Pricing Relation

The beta pricing relation can be derived from the fundamental equations of the model (1), (2),
(3) and (4) together with the form of the preferences (6). To simplify the notation, we set ∆t
to 1 in this derivation and use the index l for the asset rather than i for clarity as the latter is
generally used as the index for the X state variables.
Theorem 1. The model defined by (37), (38), (39) and (40) implies the beta pricing relation

(27) holds for our model because of the Bessel process used for the volatility. It does not
therefore hold for the long run risk models of Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Bansal, Yaron,
and Kiku (2007) which use Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes for the volatility. While it can be
argued that a Bessel process is a more reasonable one from a theoretical point of view as it does
not admit negative values,9 this means that (27) is not a general implication of long run risk
models. However, it’s analysis is interesting and can provide some insight as to the economic
forces that determine the time series variation in the cross section of expected returns.
It is also interesting to note that, when there is only volatility factor (as we find in this
study), (27) is a statement of the fact that there is only one factor driving the cross section of
expected returns. In this sense, the results of Gibbons and Ferson (1985) are consistent with
our finding of one volatility factor as they find that the returns of the Dow Jones 30 stocks are
consistent with a single, time-varying risk premium.
We are unable to test this hypothesis satisfactorily in our approach as the lagged factor
betas are not significantly different from each other. This is related to econometric issues which
arise due to the fact that the major part of the return is composed of the long run risk factor
innovations. This leads to poor estimation of the betas with respect to the lagged factors and
spurious rejections of the relation in asset pricing tests. This can be shown using Monte Carlo
simulations.10
9
In the calibration of Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2012), the probability of negative volatilities in the stable
distribution is nearly 20%.

The analysis of a Monte Carlo simulation showing this in the context of the CAPM is available upon request.

3.2

Relation to Standard Linear Factor Models

We note from the standard loglinear approximation of Campbell and Shiller (1988) that innovations of the log P/D ratios are similar to innovations in excess returns minus dividend
growth.
Explicitly, the loglinear approximation (28) states that the return is approximately given
by
rl,t+1 − rf,t ≈ ν0,l − rf,t + ν1,l (pl,t+1 − dl,t+1 ) − (pl,t − dl,t ) + ∆dl,t+1

(28)

This, in turn, can be written as
rl,t+1 − rf,t ≈Et [rl,t+1 − rf,t ] + ν1,l (pl,t+1 − dl,t+1 − Et [pl,t+1 − dl,t+1 ])
|
{z
}
price dividend ratio innovation

(29)

+ (dl,t+1 − dl,t − Et [dl,t+1 − dl,t ])
|
{z
}
dividend growth innovation

Hence, the factor structure of excess returns is composed of three parts
1. the factor structure in expected excess returns (given by the V factors);
2. the factor structure of innovations to the log price dividend ratios;
3. the factor structure in dividend growth innovations; and
Since the model does not constrain the factor structure in dividend growth innovations, it
does not imply any specific relation between the return and P/D factor structures. We do,
however, show in appendix C that it can be chosen in a manner to make these factor structures
consistent with data. We also document, in this appendix, that these factor structures are,
in fact, different in the data so that the use of one instead of the other is not vacuous. The
dividend growth innovation factor structure, loosely speaking, can thus explain the fact that
the price dividend ratios of the twenty five Fama-French portfolios have a two factor structure
while their excess returns have a three factor structure.
17

In other words, the methodology that we use closely parallels the standard factor analysis
and principal component analysis methods of Connor and Korajczyk (1986), Lehmann and
Modest (1988), Lehmann and Modest (2005) and Connor and Korajczyk (2009) but differs in
the way the factors are constructed. While standard factor analysis constructs factors from the
returns themselves, this methodology pays more attention to returns that are not explained by
contemporaneous dividend growth, or in other words, to the more interesting non-trivial part
of returns.
It must be emphasized that, despite these close parallels, the methodology used by us is
vital as it enables to estimate the slow moving long run risk factors directly which is not
possible with the return factors. This is because the return factors only directly contain the
volatility type long run risk factors and even these are swamped by the remaining sets of factors
identified above, namely the innovations in the long run risk factors and the dividend growth
innovations.

Data

We examine the cross section of annual returns on several stock portfolios for the period 1943
to 2008, i.e., 66 years. While we primarily use annual consumption data, we compute consumption growth volatility using quarterly consumption data to obtain more precise estimates.
Consumption data is obtained from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables available at the BEA web site. Real annual per capita consumption is defined to be the
nominal aggregate annual consumption of nondurables and services divided by the NIPA estimate of the mid-year population and deflated by the implicit personal consumption deflator.11
Annual consumption growth is defined to be the first difference of the logarithm of this series.
11

Since we make use of data expressed in terms of chained dollars, we use a Tornqvist type index (Whelan 2000)
to construct the implicit consumption deflator.

18

Quarterly seasonally adjusted consumption data is also obtained from NIPA and it’s growth
is defined in an analogous manner.
The proxy for the nominal risk-free rate is the Fama 3 month T-bill rate obtained from
CRSP. It is converted to two proxies of the real risk free rate using the realized and past
inflation as measured by the CPI (as discussed in the relevant section of this paper). The CPI
data for this is obtained from CRSP.
The stock market proxy (used to determine the relationship between the factors and future
dividend growth and expected returns) is defined as the CRSP value-weighted index of all
stocks listed on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. The construction of portfolios based on size
and book-to-market ratios is as in (Fama and French 1993) and (Fama and French 1996). Data
on the 25 (5 × 5) portfolios sorted on the basis of both these characteristics is obtained from
Ken French’s web site.
For testing the asset pricing relationships with portfolios other than the ones used to
estimate the factors (we call this out of sample testing), we use three sets of ten portfolios each
formed on the basis of long term reversal, short term reversal and the earnings to price (E/P)
ratio. The long term reversal portfolios are formed monthly on the basis of stock’s return over
the past five years minus it’s return over the past year. In other words, they are formed at time
t − 1 (time being indexed by month) by sorting stocks into ten portfolios according to their
returns from t − 61 to t − 13. Similarly, short term reversal portfolios are formed at time t − 1
by sorting stocks into ten portfolios based on their return from t − 2 to t − 1. The E/P based
portfolios are formed at the end of June of year t by sorting stocks into ten portfolios (using
NYSE breakpoints) on the basis of their E/P ratios where E is defined to be the earnings before
extraordinary items during fiscal year t − 1 and P is defined to be the market capitalization at
the end of December of year t − 1. Data on these thirty portfolios is also obtained from Ken
French’s web site.

19

Monthly dividends of these portfolios are calculated using the difference between the returns
of the corresponding dividend reinvested and non-reinvested portfolios. The price-dividend
ratios are then calculated by dividing the real price of the non-reinvested portfolio by the
sum of the lagged twelve real monthly dividends. This procedure accounts for the pronounced
seasonality of the dividend series. The nominal prices and dividends are deflated by the CPI
to get these real prices and dividends. As pointed by Van Binsbergen and Koijen (2010), the
effect of assumptions regarding the handling of dividends paid during the year on the price
dividend ratios is negligible with the correlation between the different measures being about
0.9999.
Real time consumption data is obtained from the web site of the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis and is described by Croushore and Stark (2001). The real consumption during a
quarter is defined to be the sum of the real consumption of nondurables and services during that
quarter. The real consumption during a year is defined to be the sum of the real consumptions
during each quarter of that year. Real per capita consumption during a period is defined to
be the real consumption during that period divided by the mid-period estimate of population.
The real time annual per capita consumption growth for year t is defined to be the difference
between the logarithms of the real per capita consumptions during years t and t−1 respectively
as calculated using data of vintage Q1 of year t + 1. To provide an example, the data set of
Q1 1976 vintage is used to construct the real time annual per capita consumption growth for
1975. It is constructed by adding the real nondurables and services consumptions of Q1-Q4
1974 and Q1-Q4 1975, dividing each of them by the mid-year estimates of the population, and
then taking the difference of the logarithms of the corresponding quantities.

Empirical Findings

5.1

Structural Break Implied by the Factors

Marakani (2009) documents strong evidence that the parameters of long run risk models could
not have been the same before and after 1942. Hence, we only consider the post 1942 period
in our analysis and assume that consumers are myopic and do not consider the possibility of
regime change in the model.12 We defer the examination of an extended model where the
consumers are aware of possible regime shifts to future research.13

Construction of the Principal Components and Their Innovations

From (7), the problem of obtaining the factors of log P/D ratios is, for a fixed number of
n+m
factors n + m, equivalent to the problem of finding time series processes Fi,t
to solve

where X is the matrix of demeaned log P/D ratios, N is the number of portfolios, T is the length
of the time series, F are the factors and Λ are the loadings of the individual log P/D ratios on
them (the superscript n + m keeps track of the number of assumed factors). The equivalency
of the two problems follows trivially from the assumption that the error terms are i.i.d and
Gaussian. Hence, this problem is the same as the well studied standard factor analysis problem
(of which (Connor and Korajczyk 2009) is an excellent review). The assumptions regarding
the error terms are not crucial for our results as they hold even if we perform the principal
component analysis after first scaling the log P/D ratios to make them each have unit variance
or after first scaling them each according to their residual variances. In other words, our results
are robust to the use of different specifications for the error term.
12

The use of post-1945 or post-1950 data does not significantly change our results.
In this context, we note that Bekaert and Engstrom (2010) have recently argued that habit formation models
are better able to incorporate the very different dynamics observed during and after the Great Depression.
13

21

Hence, the factors can be calculated by singular value decomposition of the matrix of demeaned log P/D ratios. This is equivalent to the more usual method of using the eigenvectors of
the covariance matrix or directly solving (30), but is preferred because it has greater numerical
stability. The number of relevant factors k = m + n is determined by using the information

suggested by Bai and Ng (2008) and by Connor and Korajczyk (2009). This method is known
to be consistent when the number of quantities and the length of the time series become large.
As pointed out by Bai and Ng (2008), traditional methods usually overestimate the number of
factors that are present in the data.

We carry out this procedure on the annual log P/D ratios of the 25 Fama French portfolios
from 1943 (to account for the structural break). We find two significant factors in this series
(as well as in the quarterly and monthly series of log P/D ratios – not reported).
We plot the information criterion as a function of the number of factors in figure 1 and the
variances explained by the principal components in figure 2.
Using the same procedure, we find two factors in the first differences of the quarterly log
P/D ratios of these portfolios. We also note that the plot of the variances explained by their
principal components in figure 3 unambiguously points to a two factor structure.
We tabulate the rotations that relate the annual log P/D ratios of the 25 Fama-French
portfolios to their first two principal components, denoted by F1,2 with the subscript the
principal component, in table 1. From the rotation matrices, we find that F1 loads positively
on all the portfolios and loads slightly more on the small stock portfolios. In contrast, F2

loads positively on large and value stocks and negatively on growth and small stocks. We thus
expect F2 to be closely related to the cross sectional differences among the portfolios.
We estimate the innovations of the two identified principal components as the OLS residuals
obtained on regressing them on n lags of themselves, n being the smallest value for which they
are serially uncorrelated at the 10% level according to both the Ljung-Box and Durbin-Watson
tests. n is always found to be one for the annual data and sometimes two for the quarterly
data (not reported). We denote these estimated innovations as IF1 and IF2 .

5.3

Principal Components & the Long Run Risk Factors

Since the Xi factors represent joint predictable components of consumption and dividend
growth, a positive and significant coefficient should result on regressing future consumption
and dividend growth against these factors. Similarly, since the Vj factors are components of the
consumption growth volatility, regressing consumption growth volatility against them should
also lead to a positive and significant coefficient. Since the principal component analysis only
identifies affine transformations of the full set of long run risk factors, we can, in general,
expect to find that the principal components will be related to both the Xi and Vj factors
and that both regressions above will lead to significant coefficients given that the long run
risk model holds. However, we find that only the volatility regression generates a significant
coefficient for the first identified principal component F1 and that only the future consumption
and dividend growth regression generates a significant coefficient for the second identified
25

principal component F2 . This implies that the first identified principal component is naturally
identifiable as an affine function of the only V factor and that the second identified principal
component is naturally identifiable as an affine function of the only X factor.
We now examine the volatility regression in some detail. In order to construct a consumption volatility series, we estimate the innovations of quarterly consumption growth v,t as the
OLS residuals obtained on regressing it on n lags of itself, n being the smallest value for which
they are uncorrelated at the 10% level according to both the Ljung-Box and Durbin-Watson
tests. n is found to be three for this data series. Using these estimated innovations, the
consumption volatility series is estimated as

vtn = log

(32)

This methodology is standard and has been used in the context of long run risk models by
Beeler and Campbell (2012).
The results of regressing vt24 , vt12 and vt6 on F1q and F2q , the factors constructed using
quarterly log P/D ratios, are summarized in table 2. We also include the results of regressing
de-trended vt24 , vt12 and vt6 on de-trended F1q as a robustness check as both consumption growth
volatility and the first principal component have a pronounced time trend in the data as seen in
figure 4. They show that F1 is very closely related to consumption growth volatility with the R2
of the 24 quarter volatility regression being as high as 81%. Even the R2 for 6 quarter volatility
regression, where the measurement error is likely to be high, is quite high at 47%. Further,
the fact that the coefficients of F1 in the various regressions are very similar to each other
(i.e. for volatilities estimated over several horizons) provides strong evidence that the relation
is robust. In contrast, there is no evidence at all that F2 is related to consumption growth
volatility. This result, when combined with the result, detailed below, that F1 is unrelated to
future consumption and dividend growth, leads to the conclusion that F1 is an affine function of
a V type factor. This conclusion follows because F1 satisfies the conditions we have identified
26

for such a factor : it is an affine function of log P/D ratios, it tracks consumption growth
volatility and does not predict future consumption or dividend growth.14

Newey-West corrected with the required number of lags estimated using the procedure in
(Newey and West 1994). The principal components of the quarterly log P/D ratios were used
in these regressions. Use of the rotation matrix for the annual log P/D ratios to create quarterly
versions of these principal components leads to very similar results.
We now examine the dividend and consumption growth regressions in detail. The results
of regressing annual real market dividend growth (i.e., growth of annual market dividends
deflated by the CPI) on the lagged values of F1 and F2 are summarized in table 3. We find,
from them, that F2 , but not F1 , predicts market dividend growth. This predictive ability is
weakly robust to lagging twice to account for time aggregation with the coefficient for F2 being
significant at the 10% level.15 (It should also be noted that time aggregation is generally not
14

When analyzing the results obtained after de-trending, the reader should keep in mind that removing this
time trend removes important information as neither quantity is expected to have a time trend on a theoretical
basis. This is probably the reason for the lower R2 obtained after the trends are removed. The most important
aspect of these results, which is that the coefficient of de-trended F1 is significant and has the same sign as
without de-trending, still provides support to our conclusion.
15
It is interesting that F2 , which weights the value portfolios more heavily, predicts future market dividend
growth better than the log market P/D ratio (whose inability to predict dividend growth is well known (Cochrane
2005)). We hypothesize that this is because value stocks have a low duration which makes their P/D ratios
depend more on dividend growth than on future expected excess returns.

considered an issue with respect to dividend growth.) While our results are robust to time
aggregation of dividend growth along this dimension, we acknowledge that such aggregation
also leads to biases in our estimates of the price dividend ratios since we calculate them, as is
conventional in the literature, using dividends aggregated on an annual basis in order to adjust
for their pronounced seasonality. However, we also note that time aggregation of dividend
growth, in contrast to time aggregation of consumption growth, is generally not considered a
significant issue in the literature, that our model specification is annual rather than monthly
and that our results are robust to the use of either of the conventional assumptions regarding
the investment of dividends received during the year (the first being that such dividends are
invested in nominal cash until the end of the year and the second being that they are invested
in the asset itself until the end of the year16 ).
16

The convention used in the presented calculations is equivalent to the assumption that dividends received
during the year are consumed immediately and that the agent is completely indifferent to the timings of these
dividends during the year.

28

The results of regressing annual real time consumption growth against the lagged values of
F1a and F2a are also summarized in table 3. We find, from them, that F2a also predicts real time
consumption growth as defined in the data section and that this predictive ability is robust
to lagging twice to account for time aggregation. This is in accordance with the long run risk
hypothesis that dividend and consumption growth share the same persistent component(s)
X.17 From the results in table 3, we conclude that F2 can be identified as an affine function of
a X type factor as it satisfies the essential properties of such factors : it is an affine function
of log P/D ratios, predicts dividend and consumption growth but not consumption growth
volatility.
We find that F2 also satisfies another expected property of the X factor in many long run
risk models. It has been pointed out by Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2007), Bansal, Dittmar, and
Lundblad (2005), Bansal, Dittmar, and Kiku (2009), Da (2009) and others, the long run risk
model implies that assets with higher sensitivity of predictable dividend growth to the long
run risk factor X, which is measured by φi,l in our model, have higher expected excess returns.
While this is not an implication of the long run risk model we use as we do not set πi,l,x to zero,
our version still implies a positive relationship between φi,l and the expected excess return of
asset l holding πi,l,x constant. Hence, if the long run risk model holds, we do find that the
coefficients obtained on regressing portfolio dividend growths on FX are significantly different
from each other and are related to their excess returns in the expected manner. Specifically,
we find that the F test strongly rejects the equality of the regression coefficients obtained on
regressing real dividend growth of each of the 25 portfolios on the lagged value of F2 at the
p < 0.001 level and that these regression coefficients are higher for the portfolios of small and
value stocks which have higher excess returns. We note that this result is not very surprising
17

We note that while the use of this measure of consumption is not standard, it is more relevant for the
current analysis as it better matches the information structure of the consumers in the economy. (It is also
possible that real time data captures the sentiment of consumers as it reflects their current view of the state of
the economy.)

Table 3: Results of regressing real annual market dividend growth (∆dm where dm is the log

and F2 , the two significant principal components of the log P/D ratios of the 25 Fama-French
portfolios formed on the basis of size and book to market ratio, and the lagged log market P/D
ratio (log(P/D)m ). The standard errors are Newey-West corrected with the required number
of lags estimated using the procedure in (Newey and West 1994). The regressions using the
log market P/D ratio are for the same time period as for the ones using F1 and F2 (1944-2008
for the one year dividend growth regressions, 1946-2008 for the three year dividend growth
regressions). The one and two year real time consumption growth regressions are over the
periods 1966-2008 and 1967-2008 respectively.
given the form of the rotation matrix relating F2 to the log P/D ratios.18 We do not test this
relation explicitly as it is not an implication of the model we use.
Given the long run risk model, we also expect to find little if any cross-sectional variation
of the sensitivity of dividend growth to the volatility factor. Empirically, we do find that this
is largely the case with corresponding F statistic for F1 (the principal component related to
the volatility) being much lesser at 1.73 (p = 0.015). While this is marginally significant, it

is mostly because the regression coefficients for the portfolios corresponding to the smallest
stocks being larger than the others.19 Since the size premium is much less robust than the
value premium, we see that this cross-sectional variation is not strongly related to expected
excess returns.
Since the above regressions involve the whole sample and are subject to forward looking
bias, we investigate whether the predictability implications that lead to the identification of
the first two principal components as affine functions of the long run risk factors X and V
hold out of sample in the section on asset pricing test results, and find that they indeed do so.
We also show that look-ahead bias-free versions of the factors and their innovations estimated
using the 25 Fama-French portfolios formed on the basis of size and book to market ratio
successfully explain the expected returns of three sets of ten portfolios formed on the basis of
short term reversal, long term reversal and the earnings to price ratio.20 Hence, we see that
our results are robust both to forward looking bias and are not an artifact of testing the model
with the same portfolios as those that are used to estimate the factors.

Asset Pricing Tests

Since the dividends in this analysis have to be measured annually due to seasonality considerations, the asset pricing restrictions are only strictly correct at the annual time scale. Hence,
we restrict ourselves to annual data in the following analysis.21

5.4.1

Cross Sectional Regressions

When we investigate the pricing relationship (15) using the 25 Fama-French portfolios, we
find that it performs well. The cross sectional regression results are tabulated in table 4 and
19
We used annual values for the above analysis in order to eliminate issues arising from dividend and CPI
seasonality as well as to minimize the confounding effects that arise from overlapping regressions.

They also explain the expected excess returns of the 25 Fama-French portfolios formed on the basis of size
and book to market ratio.
21
In unreported results, we find that the model also exhibits good performance at the quarterly time scale.

regressions detailed below provides support for our specification as the intercept must be zero
for a correctly specified model, a fact emphasized by Jagannathan and Wang (2007).
Since we obtained the P/D ratio factors using the 25 Fama and French portfolios, it is
necessary to check that these factors can price other portfolios as well. For that purpose we
examine three sets of ten portfolios formed on the basis of short term reversal, long term
reversal, and the E/P ratios. The cross sectional regression results are tabulated in table 5
and plotted in figure 6. We again find that the R2 is high at 79.1% and the intercept is low
at -1.6%/year and not statistically different from zero at conventional significance levels with
the absolute value of the t statistic being only 0.71.

A common concern when using the cross sectional methodology is that the betas do not
show sufficient cross sectional variation. However, we find that this is not the case. The F test
for the hypothesis that the factor innovation betas are the same is strongly rejected for both
factor innovations (p < 0.001). However, the analogous test for the lagged negative volatility
factor cannot reject the hypothesis that these lagged volatility factor betas are different from
each other even at the 10% level of significance. Hence, we also report the results excluding
the lagged volatility factor betas in tables 4 and 5.

5.4.2

Robustness tests

Since the excess returns of the 25 Fama-French portfolios formed on the basis of size and
book to market ratio have a strong factor structure, it is important to use robust test statistics to eliminate the problem of useless factors being identified as useful (a problem forcefully brought out by Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2006), Kleibergen (2009) and Kleibergen
(2010)). Hence, we test the above cross sectional regressions using the robust test statistics
suggested by Kleibergen (2009) in appendix D to ensure that the factors here are not useless
and that the hypothesis of factor pricing is not rejected. As shown in detail in this appendix,
we find that both conditions are satisfied for our model specifications.

35

We also note that the number of time series observations in our analysis is small due to our
low frequency data and that we find the betas of the assets to be significantly different from
each other. As noted by Kan and Zhang (1999), these characteristics make it much less likely
that a useless factor is spuriously found to be “useful” in a cross-sectional regression. Finally,
we note that the cross-sectional regression intercept should be zero if the model is correctly
specified, as emphasized by Jagannathan and Wang (2007), and that the intercept that we
obtain for each of the cross-sectional regressions examined in the previous subsection is indeed
close to zero and insignificantly different from it. In particular, the intercepts in all the cross
sectional regressions that we investigate are insignificant and the absolute t statistic value is
always less than 1.
As Ferson, Nallareddy, and Xie (2012) emphasize, it is important to check whether the
results are robust to possible look ahead bias. We therefore investigate this later in this
section. We find that our findings are not due to possible look ahead bias. In fact, we find that
the bias free estimates of the log P/D factors and their innovations perform slightly better.

5.4.3

Price Dividend Ratio Factors vs Return Factors

The common practice in the empirical finance literature is to use excess return factors. We
therefore examine the relation between them and the price dividend ratio factors.
We now interpret these results in terms of our earlier discussion relating price dividend
ratio and return factors. Recall that it follows from (29) that the factor structure of returns is
composed of three parts : (i) the factor structure of expected returns, (ii) the factor structure
of innovations to the log price dividend ratios; and (iii) the factor structure of dividend growth
innovations. As we show in appendix C, the latter can be chosen in a manner to make the log
price dividend ratio factor structure consistent with the return factor structure.

where the βs follow from the form of the dividend process.23 It follows that, for our model,
principal component analysis will recover the volatility factors, Vj,t , j = 1, 2...m, the innovation
to the consumption growth of the representative agent, (∆ct+1 −Et [∆ct+1 ]),24 innovations in the
factors that drive expected consumption growth, (Xi,t+1 − Et [Xi,t+1 ]), i = 1, 2, ..n, innovations
in the factors that drive volatility, (Vj,t+1 − Et [Vj,t+1 ]), j = 1, 2..m, and the factors in the
dividend growth innovations l,t+1 .
However, it is key to note that this principal component analysis will not recover the
factors driving expected consumption growth, Xi,t , i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Further, the factors driving
expected consumption growth and volatility will explain only a small part of the variance in
comparison with their innovations and l,t+1 may have some factor structure that may not
be relevant for explaining the cross section of expected returns. This will lead to imprecise
estimates of Vj,t , j = 1, 2...m. Hence, it will be difficult to evaluate the important implications
of the long run risk models that Vj,t , j = 1, 2...m should track consumption growth volatility
over time and that Xi,t , i = 1, 2...n should forecast consumption and dividend growth rates
based on excess return factors alone.

It should be noted that this equation is specialized to our model while 29 is generally valid. For example,
the βl,c is zero for the market in many standard long run risk models such as the ones studied by (Bansal and
Yaron 2004) and (Constantinides and Ghosh 2008) and that an asset dependent constant will also be present if
the volatility is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

This will not be recovered in some long run risk models such as the one in (Bansal and Yaron 2004)

This point is empirically supported by the results documented in table 7. These results show
that the estimated consumption/dividend growth factor using P/D ratios is able to predict
dividend and real time consumption growth much better than the Fama-French factors. In
fact, the regressions documented in the table show that the identified X type P/D factor is
able to completely drive out the Fama-French factors when predicting these quantities. This
factor is also far superior to just the use of the market price dividend ratio as documented in
table 3.
In order to better understand the relationship between the Fama-French and P/D factors,
we investigate the relation between the innovations of the log price dividend ratio factors and
the Fama-French factors (which are excess return factors) as the latter have been proposed as
proxies for future consumption growth by Parker and Julliard (2005) and consumption growth
volatility by Boguth and Kuehn (2008). We summarize the results of regressing IF−V ol and
IFX on the annual Fama-French factors in table 8. We find, from them, that IF−V ol and
IFX can be approximately written as M kt + SM B and M kt + HM L respectively. In other
words, we find that, in the framework of this analysis, excess market returns are related to both
consumption growth and consumption growth volatility, that SMB is related to consumption
growth volatility and that HML is related to future consumption and dividend growth.
We can thus see that the Fama-French factors can be interpreted within the context of the
long run risk model as capturing innovations to the long run risk factors with SMB capturing
innovations to consumption growth volatility, HML capturing innovations to expected consumption growth and the excess market return capturing innovations in both these quantities.
Interestingly, we find that (see table (6)) the Fama-French (return) factors do not drive out the
long run risk factors and the long run risk factor innovations, which is consistent with these
observations. Hence, the strong empirical support for the Fama and French three factor model
does not necessarily mean that the data is inconsistent with long run risk models. The two
models may be alternative representations of the same underlying phenomenon.

and IFX are the innovations of the first two principal components of the log P/D ratios of
the 25 Fama-French portfolios formed on the basis of size and book to market ratio over the
period 1943-2008 which, as we show, can be interpreted as negative volatility and consumption/dividend growth factors. The regressions are over the period 1944-2008.

Addressing look ahead bias

To check the robustness of the results, we estimate the rotation matrices relating the log price
dividend ratios of the portfolios to their first two principal components using only data from
1943 to 1975 and use them to construct out of sample version of the factors from 1976 to 2008.
We find that these estimated out of sample factors, labelled F1os and F2os , track consumption
growth volatility and predict market dividend and real time consumption growth in a manner
similar to that documented for the in sample factors.

The results of regressing 24 quarter consumption growth volatility on the estimated out of
sample factors, summarized in table 9, show that the relation found in the paper is robust.
Specifically, consumption growth volatility is found to be very significantly negatively related
to the first out of sample factor F1os and to be unrelated to the second out of sample factor
F2os .

Table 10: Results of regressing real annual market dividend growth and real time consumption
growth (∆cRT ) against lagged F1os and F2os , the out of sample estimates of the first and second
price to dividend ratio factors. The regressions are over the period 1976-2008 while the factors’
rotation matrices estimated using data from 1943-1975. The standard errors are Newey-West
corrected with the required number of lags estimated using the procedure of (Newey and
West 1994). The regressions using the log market price dividend ratio use data from 1976
onwards in order to be consistent with the others.
The predictability of real time consumption and market dividend growth using the out of
sample factors are summarized in table 10. We can see that only the second factor is relevant
in predicting real time consumption growth and market dividend growth. The result for the
three year market dividend growth seems marginal but that is because the number of data
points is much smaller and the R2 of the regression is still found to be quite high.
To further address the critique of Ferson, Nallareddy, and Xie (2012), we also undertake a
complete re-analysis of the model where we remove the possibility of look-ahead bias. We do
so by re-calculating the rotation matrix for the principal components, and therefore the factors
and their innovations, every year with these components and their innovations being calculated
based on the rotation matrix estimated with data up to the previous year. We ensure that a
minimum of 25 years of data is used for the calculation of each rotation matrix. We denote
these no look ahead bias version of the factors as F1nlb and F2nlb .

first) while for the WLS coefficients, only the t values with the correction are reported. The
R2 adjusted for the number of variables is reported below the unadjusted R2 .
Such a calculation results in reasonable look-ahead bias estimates of the innovations of the
factors as the innovations are estimated in a manner which only makes use of a single rotation
matrix which is calculable by the agent at that time.25 Hence, this version of the robustness
check is most important for establishing the robustness of the cross sectional regressions to
look-ahead bias as the cross sectional regression results are mostly dependent on the factor
innovations.26
25
The estimation of the factors themselves is, however, likely to be quite noisy using this approach as different
rotation matrices are used for each year. This why the predictability analysis in tables 9 and 10 was carried out
with look ahead bias free factors estimated with a single rotation matrix.
26
We also, however, find that the results of this robustness check for the predictability implications is largely
supportive of our hypothesis and the results are available upon request.

For the sake of brevity, we only report the results for the cross-sectional regression of the
thirty portfolios based on long term reversal, short term reversal and the earnings to price
ratio on look-ahead bias free versions of the factors and their innovations as it also removes
the concern that the factors are estimated with the same portfolios as are being tested. These
results are summarized in table 11 and are plotted in figure 7. The results are highly supportive
for the model as the R2 is high and that the intercept of 0.0005 is essentially zero. The latter
is important as it is known from the study of Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2006) that the
R2 by itself is not very significant and that a close to zero intercept with a high R2 provides

43

significantly more evidence for the model than just a high R2 (a fact also emphasized by
Jagannathan and Wang (2007)).27

5.4.5

GMM Tests

While the cross sectional regression methodology above provides a nice, intuitive way of understanding the importance of the different variables in the stochastic discount factor, it can only
handle linear relationships and needs relatively restrictive assumptions for accurate results.
Since the exact Euler equation restrictions

e
Et [Mt+1 Rt+1
]=0

(34)

are nonlinear in nature, we now use GMM to ensure that the above results are robust. The
results of the GMM estimation of (34) using the 25 Fama-French portfolios sorted on the basis
of size and book to market ratio are summarized in table 12. The corresponding results for
the three sets of ten portfolios sorted on the basis of long term reversal, short term reversal
and E/P ratio are summarized in table 13 .
Since excess returns are used in these tests, the mean of the stochastic discount factor
must be accounted for by adding an additional moment condition (as pointed out by Kan
and Robotti (2008)). We report the results obtained after adding this moment condition in
tables 14 and 15 respectively. For the former, we only report the results obtained using the
identity weighting matrix as the estimated optimal weighting matrix is almost singular. These
results are found to be closer to those obtained using the cross sectional regression approach.
In particular, Γ1 is found to be fairly large and significant and αv is found to be negative for
the 25 Fama-French portfolios, though not significantly so.
27
While consumption growth was included in this cross sectional regression in order to illustrate the relative
unimportance of consumption growth, it is clear from the almost zero value of λ∆c that it’s addition or removal
has almost no impact on the results.

portfolios formed on the basis of size and book to market ratio over the period 1944-2008 without performing the correction for the effect of the unspecified mean of the stochastic discount factor suggested
by (Kan and Robotti 2008). For this, we make use of the expression for the log stochastic discount factor
log Mt+∆t = ∆t(Γ0 + Γ1 X + Γ2 (V − V̄ ) − αx (Xt+∆t − Et [Xt+∆t ]) − αv (Vt+∆t − Et [Vt+∆t ]) − αc (ct+∆t −
Et [ct+∆t ])), where X and V are the underlying long run risk state variables, and drop the last term since
it is known to be unimportant (we have verified that it’s inclusion does not change the results). F−V ol
and FX are the first two principal components of the log P/D ratios of the 25 Fama-French portfolios
formed on the basis of size and book to market ratio over the period 1943-2008 which, as we show,
can be interpreted as negative volatility and consumption/dividend growth factors which are affinely
related to X and V . IF−V ol and IFX are their innovations. The affine relationship between X and FX
−V̄
, where V̄ is the mean of
and V and F−V ol together with the zero mean of X imply that FXX and FV−V
ol
V , are the linear coefficients of the affine relationships. Hence, the identified coefficients of F−V ol and
FX and their innovations in the GMM estimation are related to the corresponding coefficients of the
state variables in the manner indicated.

αx , the market price of risk for shocks to expected consumption growth, is notably highly
significantly positive in all of the GMM estimations with estimates of it’s scaled value ranging
from 1.56 to 2.90. Since αx is directly related to the coefficient of relative risk aversion γ, we
can use these estimates to obtain an estimate for γ.
We note that the identification of the two factors in this study also enables the determination of the relative importance of cash flow and discount rate risks for cross-sectional returns in
the context of long run risk models. This is because the rate at which future equity cash flows
are discounted (the equity risk premium) is determined by the consumption growth volatility
in these models as shown by Bansal and Yaron (2004) and others, which in turn means that
the first factor proxies for discount rate risk and that the second proxies for cash flow risk. The
results of the analysis using the innovations of the two factors indicate that cash flow risk is
cross-sectionally more important than discount rate risk. This result is robust to the inclusion

of the lagged factors, as is seen from the GMM results summarized below. This study thus
underlines the importance of cash flow risk and contributes to the recent strand of literature
that demonstrates that it can explain a large proportion of the cross-sectional return variation
(Campbell and Vuolteenaho 2004) (Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad 2005) (Cohen, Polk, and
Vuolteenaho 2008) (Campbell, Polk, and Vuolteenaho 2009) (Da and Warachka 2009).

5.5

Relative Risk Aversion

Since it is largely FX that predicts future dividend and consumption growth, we can, as pointed
out, among others, by Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2008) and Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2010),
use the GMM estimate for the coefficient of scaled innovation of X (i.e. IFX ) in the stochastic
discount factor, αIFX , to make an estimate of the preference for the early resolution of uncertainty, i.e. γ − 1/ψ. Since the value of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), ψ, has
to be large in long run risk models in order for them to be consistent with the low volatility of
the real risk free rate, this value also provides an estimate of the relative risk aversion γ since
γ− < 1/ψ ≈ γ if ψ > 1.28
28
We also note that a large value of ψ is not only strongly suggested by the low volatility of the real risk free
rate but also by the analysis of household survey data by Vissing-Jørgensen and Attanasio (2003) and by the
study of an elegant natural experiment by Kapoor and Ravi (2010).

portfolios formed on the basis of size and book to market ratio over the period 1944-2008, together with
the correction for the biases introduced due to the unspecified mean of the stochastic discount factor
suggested by (Kan and Robotti 2008). For the computation, we make use of the expression for the log
stochastic discount factor log Mt+∆t = ∆t(Γ0 +Γ1 X +Γ2 (V − V̄ )−αx (Xt+∆t −Et [Xt+∆t ])−αv (Vt+∆t −
Et [Vt+∆t ]) − αc (ct+∆t − Et [ct+∆t ])), where X and V are the underlying long run risk state variables,
and drop the last term since it is known to be unimportant (we have verified that it’s inclusion does not
change the results). F−V ol and FX are the first two principal components of the log P/D ratios of the
25 Fama-French portfolios formed on the basis of size and book to market ratio over the period 19432008 which, as we show, can be interpreted as negative volatility and consumption/dividend growth
factors which are affinely related to X and V . IF−V ol and IFX are their innovations. The affine
relationship between X and FX and V and F−V ol together with the zero mean of X imply that FXX
−V̄
and FV−V
, where V̄ is the mean of V , are the linear coefficients of the affine relationships. Hence, the
ol
identified coefficients of F−V ol and FX and their innovations in the GMM estimation are related to the
corresponding coefficients of the state variables in the manner indicated. We carry out this test only
with the identity matrix as the optimal weighting matrix is very close to singular. Note that the Dist
statistic is not comparable with that in table 12 as the means of the stochastic discount factors are
different.

We obtain this estimate by first noting the relation (which follows from the identification

By noting that the persistence of the X process is the same as that of FX since they are

regression coefficient of 0.0123 obtained in table 3, we find that

FX
X

≈ 150. This value, together

with the annual estimate of 0.99712 ≈ 0.97 for ν1 from Bansal and Yaron (2004) and the GMM
estimates of 1.56 to 2.89 for the market price of risk of innovations to FX , give an estimate of
between 40 and 75 for γ − 1/ψ (or equivalently γ since γ  1/ψ). While high, this estimate is
similar to the value of 60 obtained by Chen, Favilukis, and Ludvigson (2007).
The leverage of market dividend growth on long term consumption growth can be similarly
estimated from the results in table 3. It is found to be about 3.3 when three year market
dividend growth is used in the analysis. This value is remarkably similar to that proposed by
Bansal and Yaron (2004).

It should be noted that the main reason for the risk aversion estimate to be much higher
than that proposed by Bansal and Yaron (2004) is that the volatility of consumption growth
after the structural break (1.85 × 10−4 ) is much lower than for the entire period for which data
is available (4.92 × 10−4 ). If we scale the relative risk aversion value estimates that we obtain
by the ratio of these volatilities, we find that it is very similar to the value of 16 obtained by
Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2007). Hence, it is possible that a long run risk model which accounts
for structural breaks or regime shifts in the parameters will require a much lower relative risk
aversion to explain asset prices as such a model can have a much higher unconditional volatility
of consumption growth and still be consistent with the data. We also note that the standard
errors for our estimate are large and we cannot rule out that the relative risk aversion value is
below 10 at the 1% level of significance.

Conclusion

In this paper, we show that typical long run risk models, including those of Bansal and Yaron
(2004), Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2007) and Zhou and Zhu (2009), imply that the log P/D ratios
of financial assets have a strict factor structure when the intertemporal budget constraint of the
marginal investor can be well approximated by the loglinear method of Campbell and Shiller
(1988). Further, we demonstrate that these factors must be related to aggregate consumption
growth and consumption growth volatility when there is a representative agent. When we
restrict attention to the post-1942 data so as to account for the structural break documented
by Marakani (2009), we find that the log P/D ratios of the 25 Fama-French portfolios have
two significant factors, one of which is related to aggregate consumption growth volatility and
the other to future dividend and real time aggregate consumption growth.
These factors and their innovations do a reasonably good job of explaining the cross section
of returns of not only the 25 portfolios from which they were formed but also three sets of
ten portfolios based on long term reversal, short term reversal and the earnings to price ratio.
49

The coefficients obtained from the cross sectional regressions are statistically and economically
significant and have the right sign, and the zero beta rate is economically small and not
significantly different from zero.
We address the critique of Ferson, Nallareddy, and Xie (2012) that the original results of
Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2007) are not robust to look ahead bias. Our results go through
even when we use versions of the factors which are free of look-ahead bias. This difference is
due to the fact that we use a different method for estimating the unobserved factors that is
robust to the presence of measurement errors in consumption and the real risk free rate. We
also address one of the important critiques of the long run risk model raised by Beeler and
Campbell (2012). Beeler and Campbell (2012) point out that the log market price dividend
ratio does not predict dividend or consumption growth. We show that a price dividend ratio
factor does predict both dividend growth a real time measure of consumption growth. We
argue that this does not show up in the log market price dividend ratio as the market price
dividend ratio weights most strongly on the volatility price dividend ratio factor.
Our findings link the classical commonly used linear return factor models in the finance
literature with the more recent long run risk models. Our analysis suggests that they can be
viewed as alternative representations of the same underlying phenomenon. The advantage of
our approach lies in the fact that it additionally enables the estimation of all the underlying state variables of the long run risk model which is not possible with return factor models
alone. More specifically, we show that the return factors do not include the expected consumption/dividend growth factor of long run risk models even though they are estimable using the
P/D factors. This is corroborated empirically as our estimated consumption/dividend growth
factor drives out the Fama-French factors in predictive regressions of dividend and real time
consumption growth.
The link we establish between linear return factor models and long run risk models also
shows that the strong empirical support for the Fama and French three factor model does not

50

necessarily mean that the data are inconsistent with long run risk models. The two models
may be alternative representations of the same underlying phenomenon. The advantage of
using the proposed methodology is that it further enables us to estimate the factors of the
long run risk model themselves and hence test implications of the long run risk model which
cannot be investigated with return factors alone. The link also enables us to interpret the
Fama-French factors within the context of the long run risk model.
As Beeler and Campbell (2012) point out, long run risk models imply counter-factually
high predictability of long term aggregate consumption growth, long term dividend growth
and future market volatility by the market price-dividend ratio. In this paper, we address
the first two issues by showing that a log P/D factor does in fact predict long term dividend
growth and real time consumption growth. While we do not consider market volatility in this
paper, we do find, in unreported results, some indicative evidence that the log P/D factors
also predict some aspects of market volatility.
Beeler and Campbell (2012) also point out that long run risk models imply counterintuitively high or infinite prices for real risk free consol bonds. This weakness of the long
run risk model (and many other asset pricing models) is related to the fact that the variance
of the permanent and transitory components of it’s stochastic discount factor are inconsistent
with the data as pointed out by Bakshi and Chabi-Yo (2012). Addressing this issue may require considering alternative stochastic processes for modeling long run risk including trend
stationary models and regime switching models.

Log P/D Ratios in the General Long Run Risk Model

The methodology here closely follows that of Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Bansal, Yaron, and
Kiku (2007) as there are only two common cases where solutions to models with Epstein-ZinWeil preferences are available in the literature. The first case, which we are interested in here,
is when the returns are loglinear in the state variables and the second is when ψ = 1.
Let c, Xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n and Vj , 1 ≤ j ≤ m be the log consumption process, n processes that
determine it’s conditional growth rate and m processes that determine it’s conditional growth
rate volatility respectively. Let dl , l ≤ 1 ≤ L be the log dividend processes of L assets (in
general, the lower case variables correspond to the logarithm of the upper case variables). We
assume that these quantities follow the processes

than 1) to make the time scale dependence of the parameters explicit so that the connection
with the continuous time solution can be made in a straightforward manner. We also define
the consumption and dividend variables as rates since they are flow variables. This means, for
example, that consumption from time t to t + ∆t is given by Ct+∆t ∆t.
Since the consumer preferences are of the Epstein-Zin-Weil type (Epstein and Zin 1989)

(43)

where rc,t+∆t is the continuously compounded rate of return on the wealth W (which is the
asset that delivers a dividend of per capita consumption at every time period) from t to t + ∆t.
Since we assume complete markets,

Et [exp(mt+∆t + rc,t+∆t )] = 1

(44)

must hold.
The loglinear approximation pioneered by Campbell and Shiller (1988) allows us to write

rc,t+∆t = ν0 + ν1 (wt+∆t − ct+∆t ) − (wt − ct ) + ∆ct+∆t

(45)

ν0 = log(∆t + exp(w − c)) − ν1 (w − c) ≈ exp(c − w)(1 + (c − w))∆t

(46)

where

ν1 =

1
≈ 1 − exp(c − w)∆t
1 + exp(c − w)∆t

(47)

(the approximation holds when ∆t is small) where the bar stands for the mean value. We
further assume that the log wealth to consumption ratio can be written as

wt − ct = A0 +

and justify this below. (This approach is standard and followed by Bansal and Yaron (2004),
Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2007) and Zhou and Zhu (2009) as the only non-trivial models with
Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences which can be solved are those where the consumption to wealth
ratio is loglinear in the state variables as above or where ψ = 1, as in the model of Hansen,
Heaton, and Li (2008)).

A3

Substituting (43), (45) and (48) into (44), using the fact that

log Et [exp A(Wt+∆t − Wt )] =

A2 ∆t
2

(49)

for any A ∈ R and Wiener process W , and that (44) should hold for any possible attainable
combination of state variables (Xi , Vj ), we obtain a set of equations which enable us to solve
for A0 , A1,i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n and A2,j , 1 ≤ j ≤ m. The fact that such a set of equations with
non-vacuous solutions exist justifies the assumption (48).
The set of equations for A1,i are

(1 − γ)∆t + θA1,i (ν1 (1 − αi ∆t) − 1) = 0

(50)

so that
A1,i =

(1 − ψ1 )∆t

(51)

1 − ν1 (1 − αi ∆t)

which, in the limit ∆t → 0, becomes A1,i =

1−1/ψ
.
exp(c−w)+αi

This is the same result as that

obtained by Zhou and Zhu (2009), where there is only one X variable, once we relate his
notation of g1 for exp(c − w) and allow for the negative sign which arises from his definition
of A1 in terms of the consumption to wealth ratio. Once we set ∆t = 1 and relabel ν1 as κ1
and αi as 1 − ρ (again, there being only one X state variable) to match the notation of Bansal
and Yaron (2004), we find that our result also matches their’s.
The analogous set of equations which enables us to solve for A2,j , 1 ≤ j ≤ m is

Since these equations are quadratic, there are two solutions for each A2,j . However, one of
them diverges when σj → 0. Hence, the other solution is the one which is relevant to the
model. The final equation, which allows us to solve for A0 , is

We put (59) into (56) and use the fact that (44) must hold for any possible attainable combination of state variables (Xi , Vj ) to obtain a set of equations which enables us to solve for A0,l ,
A1,l,i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n and A2,l,j , 1 ≤ j ≤ m. The fact that such a set of equations with non-vacuous
solutions exist justifies the assumption (59).
The equations for A1,l,i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ L are

(φl,i − 1/ψ)∆t − A1,l,i (1 − ν1,l (1 − αi ∆t)) = 0

(60)

which give
A1,l,i =

(φl,i − 1/ψ)∆t
1 − ν1,l (1 − αi ∆t)

A6

(61)

As with the solution for A1,i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, this solution agrees with the continuous time one
(with n = 1, m = 2) of Zhou and Zhu (2009) and the discrete time one (with n = m = 1) of
Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2007).
The equations for A2,l,j , 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ l ≤ L are quadratic in nature and fairly complex
(as for A2,j , the solutions which do not diverge as σj → 0 are chosen). Since their precise
structure is not important for the beta pricing relation, we do not include them for brevity.
Similarly, we do not include the equation for A0,l , 1 ≤ l ≤ L.29

Beta Pricing Relations
First beta pricing relation

The beta pricing relation can be derived from the fundamental equations of the model (37),
(38), (39) and (40) together with the form of the preferences (41). To simplify the notation,
we set ∆t to 1 in this derivation.

They are available upon request from the authors. Also, it must be noted that, as the equations for
A2,j , 1 ≤ j ≤ m and A2,l,j , 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 1 ≤ l ≤ L are quadratic in nature, real solutions are not guaranteed. Our
numerical experiments indicate that this is not a serious concern as several sets of reasonable parameter values
do not give rise to this problem (this is also shown by (Zhou and Zhu 2009)). If this is a concern, we can replace
the volatility processes by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck ones as done by (Bansal and Yaron 2004) and (Bansal, Yaron,
and Kiku 2007). However, such volatility processes suffer from the problem of admitting negative values even in
continuous time. This can be quite serious, even for some common parameter values, as pointed out by (Beeler
and Campbell 2012). The square root processes used here can also give rise to negative values in discrete time
but the probability of this occurring for reasonable parameter values is minuscule and our numerical experiments
confirm this. Since both ways of modeling volatility have issues but have received wide attention in the literature
and there is no known alternative for which analytical solutions can be derived, we use results which hold for
both of them.

Since the price dividend ratios are affinely related to the X and V state variables by (59),
this is equivalent to a beta pricing relation in the innovations to the log price-dividend ratio
factors. The computation of the second expression in the left hand side of (96) can be done by
noting that the term in brackets is the residual of regressing rl,t+1 − rf,t against Vt and is equal
to the residual of regressing rl,t+1 − rf,t against the lagged log price dividend ratio factors.
An alternative approach using betas instead of residual returns can be developed when
there is one volatility factor. We now proceed to do so.
When there is only one volatility factor (i.e. m = 1), this simplifies to

after dropping the superfluous j subscript. Since E[rl,t+1 − rf,t ] = βl,V Vt from (91), a scale
multiple of βl,V can be obtained by regressing rl,t+1 − rf,t against a lagged log price divided
ratio factor which is known to be correlated with the volatility factor.30
It can be shown that the above beta pricing relation also holds when an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process is used for the volatilities instead of Bessel processes as in (Bansal and Yaron 2004),
(Constantinides and Ghosh 2008) and (Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku 2007).31

This beta pricing relation does not hold when the volatility processes are Ornstein-Uhlenbeck

and Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku (2007).

Testing Long Run Risk Models : Monte Carlo Evidence
The Model

For the purpose of analyzing the performance of the asset pricing tests, we use the long run risk
model of (Bansal and Yaron 2004). In this model, the per capita consumption and dividend
growth rates ∆c and ∆d (for M assets indexed by l) and their common persistent component
x are assumed to follow the processes assumed by (Bansal and Yaron 2004)

∆ct+1 = µ + xt + σt ηt+1

(106)

xt+1 = ρxt + ϕx σt et+1

(107)

∆dl,t+1 = µl,d + φl xt + ϕl,d σul,t+1 , 1 ≤ l ≤ M
2
σt+1
= σ 2 + ν(σt2 − σ 2 ) + σw wt+1

A16

(108)
(109)

where the shocks et+1 , ηt+1 and wt+1 are taken to be independent standard normals for parsimony. ul,t+1 is a vector of normally distributed shocks with covariance Vu which is independent
of e, η and w. In the simulations, Vu is set so as to fit the factor structure of returns. (Note
that we follow the convention that lowercase characters stand for the logarithm of quantities
denoted by the corresponding uppercase characters.)
Consumers in the model have Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences (Epstein and Zin 1989) (Weil

with γ > 1/ψ. This implies that they prefer early resolution of uncertainty and that persistent
consumption and volatility shocks have a high market price of risk. This high price of risk
results in a high equity premium and low risk-free rate. With these preferences, asset returns
satisfy

relative risk aversion, ψ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) and θ is defined to
be

(112)

The log P/D ratios of assets in this economy have a factor structure (within the loglinear
approximation) with the factors being xt and σt2 . In other words, if zi,t is the log P/D ratio of
asset i, we have
zi,t = A0,i + A1,i xt + A2,i σt2

(113)

This is shown for this particular model by (Bansal and Yaron 2004) and similar results for
related models are shown by (Bansal, Yaron, and Kiku 2007), (Drechsler and Yaron 2011),

A17

(Zhou and Zhu 2009), (Ferson, Nallareddy, and Xie 2012) and in A of this paper. Since the
dividend processes of the assets are specified in this model, the relation above gives the time
series of their prices for a given realization of the random variables. Hence, the prices and
other quantities of interest in this economy are readily simulated.

C.2

Monte Carlo Simulation of the Model

The global parameters summarized in table 16 while the asset specific parameters are chosen
to replicate the factor structure of log price dividend ratios and returns.32 We first note that
these parameters generate economic moments (calculated from 500 simulations of the long run
risk economy) which are roughly in line with the values observed in post-1942 (to account
for the structural break identified by Marakani (2009)) US consumption and return data as
shown in table 18. When realistic noise is added to the log P/D ratios as described below,
they are also compatible with the predictability of real time consumption growth in the data
as seen from the numbers in table 19. One moment which does not match well is the standard
deviation of the real risk free rate which is much smaller in the simulations than in the data.
This, however, as argued by Beeler and Campbell (2012), points to a strength rather than a
weakness of the long run risk model as most models struggle to make this quantity low enough.
Further, as we argue in the next section, this quantity is very noisily measured which means
that the reported standard deviation would be significantly larger than the actual one.33
The scaled eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the post-1942 continuously compounded
excess returns of the 25 Fama-French portfolios sorted on the basis of size and book to market ratio are tabulated in table 20 together with the mean, 5th and 95th percentiles of the
corresponding values obtained in 500 simulations of the above model for the same time period
32

They are available upon request from the authors.
Measurement error (in either inflation or dividends) can also account for the somewhat low standard deviation of real dividend growth of the portfolios in the simulations.

(65 years).34 Since the first few eigenvalues, which are of principal interest, are very similar
to those in the data, the model replicates the observed factor structure of excess returns quite
well.
The model also replicates the observed factor structure of log P/D ratios fairly well. This
is best seen from the normalized eigenvalues for the covariance matrix of the log P/D ratios of
the assets, both from the data as well as the simulations, which are tabulated in table 21. The
model’s two factor structure is highly evident here as all the eigenvalues after the second one
are zero. To better reflect the data and investigate the possible consequences of the inclusion
of small, irrelevant factors into the long run risk model, we added white noise with a variance
of 20% of the simulated values to the log P/D ratios. The introduction of this noise can also
be thought of as representing measurement error in the prices or dividends brought about due
to liquidity issues or other market imperfections. The normalized eigenvalues after adding this
34

The model was actually simulated for 165 years with the data for the first 100 years being discarded so as
to minimize the effect of the assumed initial values of the dynamic quantities.

of the long run risk model imply very high consumption-return correlations over long time

correlation even over long time frames for the given length of the data (65 years).36
We thus see that the long run risk model being simulated here is compatible not only
with many of the important observed moments of macroeconomic quantities but also with the
observed factor structure of excess returns and P/D ratios. Given this, it is interesting to
examine the performance of different asset pricing tests for long run risk models within the
context of these simulations. This will enable the study of the effect of finite sample size and
measurement noise on the efficacy of these tests and will point to the choice of test to be used

noise on these tests, we first turn to the task of establishing a reasonable estimate for the size
of this noise for two important quantities in long run risk models, the consumption growth and
the real risk free rate.

The real risk-free rate has been a problematic quantity to measure accurately since true
real risk-free assets have not been available in the market until recent times (further, even these
recent innovative instruments have limited liquidity). This quantity has therefore usually been
approximated by subtracting some measure of expected inflation from the nominal risk-free
rate. Two implicit assumptions are made in doing so. The first is that the measure of expected
A25

inflation being used is reasonable and the second is that inflation uncertainty risk is unpriced.
This first issue is a serious one for data over long time frames since inflation survey data is
typically unavailable over the entire period. The general convention in this regard has been to
use lagged or realized inflation. Hence, it is important to understand the possible size of error
that using lagged or realized inflation can cause. We therefore regress the measures of the
real risk free rate made using lagged, realized and expected inflation on each other to estimate
the amount of measurement noise. We tabulate the results in table 24. We see that the R2
of each of the regressions is quite low with the average being under 33%. This indicates that
the measurement noise in the reported real risk free rate has about twice the variance of the
underlying quantity. This is in line with the size of inflation forecast errors as reported by
Croushore (2010). Hence, for the simulations, we model the measured real risk free rate as the
actual risk free rate plus iid noise with twice it’s realized variance.
We do not investigate the second issue (the assumption of zero price of risk for inflation
risk uncertainty) but note that it’s inclusion will only strengthen the results in our favor as the
stock portfolios are real assets and their P/D ratios are real yields and thus are not directly
exposed to inflation risk.

Type I error of Asset Pricing Tests with Respect to the Long Run Risk

where zm,t is the log market P/D ratio (taken to be the log P/D ratio of the first asset in the
simulations) and ∆t is one year.
The alternate asset pricing restrictions that we consider are analogous but use the two
largest estimated log P/D ratio factors instead of the log market P/D ratio and the real risk
free rate as they should also span x and σ 2 . The principal idea behind this approach is that
given the null, they should be more accurately estimated in the presence of measurement error
since they are estimated using multiple assets. The asset pricing restriction analogous to (114)
is then given by

The above asset pricing relations do not include the βl,σ
2 σ 2 term, which, as we have

shown in theorem 1, should be included in order to make it exact. Excluding it, however, has

A28

very minor impact on the results both because the short time series in the data and the high
persistence of the long run risk processes makes these βs difficult to estimate precisely and
also because this term captures the variance in expected excess returns which is much smaller
than the expected excess returns. The latter is true because the order of magnitude of the
expected excess returns is 0.1 while that of the variance of the expected excess returns is the
square of this number, i.e. 0.01. Another reason we exclude this term is to ensure that we are
comparing our procedure with the methodology in the extant literature.
We examine whether the hypothesis that the factors being considered are useless is rejected
by the cross sectional regression methodology. This is done using the Wald test for the risk
premia of the factors with their covariance matrix being estimated in the standard manner (see
for eg., (Shanken 1992) and (Shanken and Zhou 2007)). The rejection frequencies for each of
these tests in 1000 simulations are reported in table 25. The results show that the test of the
asset pricing restriction involving the log P/D ratio factors (which also include noise calibrated
to fit the observed factor structure of log P/D ratios) display much greater power than those
involving the estimated long run risk processes. Hence, we use the former in our analysis in
this paper.

Conclusion

In this appendix, we simulate a 25 asset long run risk economy with parameters chosen so as
to match key economic and financial moments with those in U.S. economic and financial data.
We analyze the type I error of different asset pricing tests within this economy and find, when
realistic measurement noise is introduced into it, that tests using estimates of the long run
A29

risk components derived from projections of consumption growth onto the log market price
dividend ratio and real risk free rate display high type I error while those estimating the same
components using the principal components of the log price dividend ratios of the assets do
not do so. This implies that the latter type of tests have a more desirable profile. Hence, we
use such tests in this paper.

Figure 9: p-value plot of the test of the joint hypothesis of factor pricing together with
(λIF−V ol , λIFX ) = (λ̂IF−V ol , λ̂IFX ) using the FAR statistic proposed by (Kleibergen 2009) for
the 25 Fama-French portfolios formed on the basis of size and book to market ratio over the
period 1944-2008. λIF−V ol and λIFX are the factor risk premia for IF−V ol and IFX . F−V ol and
FX are the negative volatility and consumption/dividend growth factors and IF−V ol and IFX
are their innovations. F−V ol and FX are the negative volatility and consumption/dividend
growth factors and IF−V ol and IFX are their innovations.
Since the excess returns of the 25 Fama-French portfolios formed on the basis of size and
book to market ratio have a strong factor structure, it is important to use robust test statistics

to eliminate the problem of useless factors being identified as useful (a problem forcefully
brought out by Kleibergen (2009) and Kleibergen (2010)). Hence, we use the robust test
statistics suggested by Kleibergen (2009) to ensure that the factors here are not useless.
We find that these robust test statistics reject the joint hypothesis that λIF−V ol = λIFX = 0
(non-rejection of the hypothesis would indicate that the pricing factors are useless) and do not
reject either the hypothesis of factor pricing or that of λIF−V ol = λ̂IF−V ol , λIFX = λ̂IFX for
many values of (λ̂IF−V ol , λ̂IFX ) including those estimated using the cross sectional regressions
(rejection of this would indicate that the model is rejected by the data). Figure 9 contains
the plot of the p-values of the FAR test statistic for many different values of (λ̂IF−V ol , λ̂IFX ).
This statistic tests the joint hypothesis of factor pricing and of λIF−V ol = λ̂IF−V ol , λFX = λ̂IFX .
It shows that the joint hypothesis is rejected at λ̂IF−V ol = λ̂IFX = 0 and also that it is not
rejected for many other values of λ̂IF−V ol and λ̂IFX including those in table 4. Further, the
region identified by p > 0.1 excludes λIFX = 0 but not λIF−V ol = 0. This is consistent with
the findings using GMM which are analyzed in the next subsection.
The JGLS statistic which tests the hypothesis of factor pricing for a given value of λIF−V ol
and λIFX is plotted in figure 10. Since it tests a weaker hypothesis, it is not surprising that
it rejects fewer values of λIF−V ol and λIFX than the FAR statistic. When combined with
the GLS-LM statistic, also plotted in figure 10, which tests the hypothesis that λIF−V ol =
λ̂IF−V ol , λFX = λ̂IFX given that factor pricing is correct, it gives very similar results to those
given by the FAR statistic.
Hence, we can conclude that the robust test statistics show that we cannot reject the
hypothesis of factor pricing with the innovations of the two identifid log P/D factors However,
these resuls, together with the findings made through GMM, do cast some doubt on the
significance of λIF−V ol .
