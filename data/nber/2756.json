    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper proposes a theory that predicts low levels of protection during periods of \"normal\" trade volume coupled with episodes of \"special\" protection when trade volumes surge. This dynamic pattern of protection emerges from a model in which countries choose levels of protection in a repeated game setting facing volatile trade swings. High trade volume leads to a greater incentive to unilaterally defect from cooperative tariff levels. Therefore as the volume of trade expands, the level of protection must rise in a cooperative equilibrium to mitigate the rising trade volume and hold the incentive to defect in check.\n\n",
