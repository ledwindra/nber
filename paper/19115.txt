ABSTRACT
Previous economic research shows that recessions lead to worsening substance abuse. In this
paper we study the effect of recessions on admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment
using administrative data between 1992 and 2015. Using data from Treatment Episode Data Set
and a differences-in-differences empirical strategy, we find no evidence that recessions influence
the overall number of admissions. However, we document substantial heterogeneity across drugs
of abuse. Combining our findings with previous economic studies suggests that unmet need for
substance abuse treatment increases during recessions.

1. Introduction
There is a complex relationship between economic recessions and health. Ceteris
paribus, recessions decrease income and, according to standard health economic theory
(Grossman 1972), reductions in income worsen health by decreasing resources available for
health investments. However, in his seminal work, Ruhm (2003, 2000, 2005, 2008, 1995)
documented a somewhat controversial finding: recessions improve a wide range of health and
health behaviors. Ruhm outlined a series of economic mechanisms through which recessions
may influence health and health behaviors. First, during recessions workers are more likely to
lose their job, which lowers their opportunity cost of time. Thus, the full cost of time-intensive
health investments (e.g., physical activity) declines and, all else equal, these investments should
increase during recessions. Second, if health is a normal good – which canonical health
economic models assume, e.g., Grossman (1972) – health demand will decline in recessions as
income levels fall. Third, during recessions individuals also tend to lose health insurance, which
increases the out-of-pocket price of healthcare services which should lead to a reduction in the
quantity of healthcare services demanded and thus worsen health. Fourth, during expansions, the
employed work longer hours and are more likely to experience on-the-job injuries and strain,
which should reduce health. Fifth, immigration to areas experiencing growth creates congestion
and the emergence/spread of communicable diseases leading to worse health.
The mechanisms outlined by Ruhm operate in opposition to one another, with income
and insurance effects implying that recessions should worsen health and other mechanisms
implying that recessions should improve health. Thus, the overall effect of recessions on health
ex ante ambiguous and empirical study is required. 1 Moreover, it is plausible that the overall

1

Ruhm showed that the vast majority of health outcomes and health behaviors improve during recessions, suggesting
that reductions in prices for time-intensive health investments, job-related health impairments, and immigration-

2

effect of recession varies across health outcomes. 2 In this study, we extend the economic
literature on recessions and health, and address the following question: What is the effect of
recessions on admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment?
Substance abuse is an important health outcome potentially influenced by recessions
(Ruhm 1995) and is prevalent in the U.S. For instance, 22 million individuals 12 years and
older, or 8.5% of the population, met diagnostic criteria for substance abuse in 2015 (Center for
Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2015). These conditions impede health, employment,
and relationships of afflicted individuals. Substance abuse is one of the leading causes of
preventable death in the U.S. Such deaths exceed suicides, traffic fatalities, and firearm-related
deaths (Murphy, Xu, and Kochanek 2013). Recent estimates suggest that, by 2020, the costs of
substance abuse treatment within the U.S. will be $42B per year, with the vast majority ($30B or
71%) of this treatment financed by public payers (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration 2014). In terms of other important economic outcomes, substance abuse has
been linked with increased general healthcare use and costs (Balsa et al. 2009; Mark et al. 2016),
crime and violence (Carpenter 2007; French and Maclean 2006; Markowitz 2000), and reduced
labor market productivity (Terza 2002). Estimates suggest that the economic cost of substance
abuse to the U.S. is $519B per year (Caulkins, Kasunic, and Lee 2014). 3 Moreover, there is
convincing economic evidence that substance abuse, for a wide range of substances including

related congestion and disease-incidence offset reductions in income and increases in healthcare service prices faced
by consumers. One exception is mental health, which appears to decline during recessions. Ruhm also advanced
the literature substantially in terms of highlighting methodological limitations in previous, primarily non-economic,
studies. For example, Ruhm noted that many studies did not account for area-level unobservable heterogeneity and
failure to account for this heterogeneity lead to substantial bias in regression coefficient estimates.
2
Indeed, the literature has produced a mixed set of estimates, suggesting that effects vary across health outcomes.
3
This estimate is inflated by the authors from the original estimate of $481B (with $255B attributable to alcohol and
$226B attributable to illicit drugs) in 2011 dollars to 2017 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.

alcohol and opioids, increases during recessions (Davalos, Fang, and French 2012; Frijters et al.
2013; Carpenter, McClellan, and Rees 2017; Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017). 4
To mitigate the substantial internal and external costs associated with substance use there
are numerous effective and cost-effective treatment options available (Swensen 2015; Kresina
and Lubran 2011; Popovici and French 2013; Lu and McGuire 2002; French and Drummond
2005; Cartwright 2000; McCollister and French 2003; Schori 2011), including treatments for
opioid abuse (Murphy and Polsky 2016; Volkow et al. 2014; Doran 2008). Although the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of substance abuse treatment is well-established, most
individuals who would benefit from such treatment do not receive it. For instance, recent work
shows that, among individuals predicted to suffer from substance abuse, 7% receive treatment
(Creedon and Cook 2016). While there are myriad reasons for failure to receive treatment,
inability to pay is an important barrier (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality
2016). As financial resources available for all goods, including healthcare services, decline and
individuals lose health insurance (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017; Cawley and Simon 2005)
during recessions, cost barriers to treatment may increase. However, there is no economic
evidence on how substance abuse treatment utilization varies across the U.S. business cycle.
Factors outside those advanced by Ruhm may be relevant for substance abuse and may
also be influenced by recessions. Financial strain, which is likely more prevalent during
recessions than other periods of the business cycle as income levels fall and poverty rates rise
(Hoynes, Miller, and Schaller 2012), leads to worse mental health (Maclean et al. 2015;
Maclean, Webber, and French 2015). Mental health is the one health outcome that Ruhm, and

4

We note that the relationship between recessions and more moderate measures of substance use (e.g., any use,
binge drinking, and heavy drinking) is mixed. However, as we argue later in the manuscript, these forms of
substance use are less relevant for our research question which relates to serious substance abuse problems.

others, consistently show declines during recessions (Ruhm 2000; Charles and DeCicca 2008;
Tefft 2011; Bradford and Lastrapes 2013; Davalos and French 2011). Individuals may selfmedicate financial strain-induced mental health problems with substances, leading to substance
abuse and, in turn, treatment (Khantzian 1997; Peirce et al. 1994). Moreover, a substantial share
of substance abuse treatment is provided by government for free, or at a heavy discount, to
patients. Such provision of care may mute cost-based barriers to treatment but may leave
patients who rely on government-financed treatment vulnerable to state budgets which contract
during recessions (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2014). Finally,
the substance abuse treatment delivery system operates at capacity with limited financial
resources available to absorb increases in demand that may occur during recessions and/or
reductions in government funding (Carr et al. 2008; Buck 2011).
In this study, we examine how admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment vary
across the U.S. business cycle. Specialty care is defined as a hospital, a residential facility, an
outpatient treatment facility, or other facility with a treatment program that offers substance
abuse treatment. To study the relationship between recessions and specialty substance abuse
treatment utilization, we use administrative data from the Treatment Episodes Data Set (TEDS)
between 1992 and 2015. We estimate differences-in-differences models that control for a wide
range of state characteristics and state-specific linear trends. Also, we test for heterogeneity
across substances of abuse, in particular opioids; both heroin and prescription opioids given that
the U.S. is in the midst of the largest opioid epidemic in the history of the country (U. S.
Department of Health and Human Services 2017).
We find no evidence that recessions influence the overall number of admissions to
specialty substance abuse treatment. However, we identify heterogeneity across substances of

5

abuse. More specifically, a one percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate leads
to an 8.5% reduction in heroin admissions, a 7.0% increase in stimulant admissions, and a 6.9%
increase in admissions for drugs not classified elsewhere. Combining these findings with
previous economic studies showing that substance abuse worsens in recessions suggests that
unmet need for substance abuse treatment increases during recessions. Put differently, substance
abuse worsens during recessions, but there is no commensurate increase in specialty treatment
for most substances. Thus, many individuals with serious substance abuse problems are
plausibly remaining untreated during recessions.
While obviously recessions create government budget shortages, and numerous social
programs must be constrained (Association of Schools of Public Health 2008; Gordon 2012),
unmet need for substance abuse treatment can be extraordinarily costly to society. Thus,
although recessions require difficult funding allocation decisions, policymakers may wish to
prioritize substance abuse treatment, given the social costs associated with this health condition
and the benefits from treatment for both patients and society at large.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on
substance abuse and substance abuse treatment, and a review of the related literature. Our data,
variables, and methods are reported in Section 3. Section 4 outlines the main findings and
robustness checking is reported in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes.
2. Background and related literature
2.1 Background on substance abuse treatment
Substance abuse ‘occurs when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically
and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet
major responsibilities at work, school, or home’ according to the Substance Abuse and Mental

6

Health Service Administration (SAMHSA) (2015). Diagnosis of substance abuse 5 is established
using information on diminished control, social impairment, use of substances, and so forth.
Most healthcare professionals rely on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM-5) developed and published by the American Psychiatric Association
(2013) to diagnose patients with substance abuse. In particular, the DSM-5 includes 12
questions that relate to substance use and related behaviors over the past 12 month period. The
questions include continuing to use substances when consumption causes employment,
interpersonal, and health problems; tolerance; 6 and forgoing important social, employment, or
recreational activities in favor of substance use. Individuals who report two or more of these
outcomes/behaviors are typically classified as suffering from substance abuse.
Although in many cases substance abuse is a chronic condition and therefore cannot be
‘cured’, substance abuse can be successfully managed, that is allowing individuals to stop
abusing substances and lead productive lives, through suitable treatment (National Institute on
Drug Abuse 2012). Depending on the particular substance, treatment may begin with
detoxification, a process (often assisted by medications to ease withdrawal symptoms) that
allows the body to clear itself of alcohol and/or drugs (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2012).
After detoxification clears the patient’s system of substances, there are a wide range of
available treatment options. For example, counselling (individual, group, or family); self-help
programs (e.g., Alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous); outpatient care that can include
educational classes, receiving treatment in a private doctor’s office (e.g., buprenorphine for

5

The clinical term used by SAMHSA is ‘substance use disorder’. However, we use the term ‘substance abuse’ in
our manuscript as this term is commonly used outside clinical settings and may be more appropriate given the large
number of criminal justice referrals to specialty substance abuse treatment who do not necessarily meet DSM
criteria. For example, 39% of admissions in our sample are referred through the criminal justice system.

opioid addiction), or intensive outpatient treatment that requires the patient to attend classes at a
specialized substance abuse treatment facility several hours a day for an extended period; care
received in a residential setting for extended periods of time; and inpatient hospital care.
We focus on specialty substance abuse treatment in our study. This treatment modality is
defined by SAMHSA as a specialty treatment facility such as a hospital, a residential facility, an
outpatient treatment facility, or other facility with a treatment program that offers: (i) outpatient,
inpatient, or residential/rehabilitation treatment; (ii) detoxification treatment; (iii) opioid
treatment; or (iv) halfway-house services that includes substance abuse treatment (Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2014). While specialty care is clearly not the
only treatment modality available to patients (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2012), it is a
costly modality – both financially and non-financially in terms of the patient’s time. Moreover,
this modality is heavily financed through government sources (Levit et al. 2013; Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2014) and reflects the majority of substance
abuse care received (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2016). 7
2.3 Related literature on the relationship between recessions and substance abuse
Economists have explored how substance use (e.g., any use, binge drinking, heavy
drinking, drinking and driving) varies across the business cycle and this literature has produced a
wide range of estimates for the direction and magnitude of the relationship; see Pacula (2011) for

7

The 2015 National Survey of Drug Use and Health asks respondents the location of substance abuse treatment
received in the past year (respondents can list multiple responses). The percentages are as follows: hospital 19.5%,
rehabilitation facility – inpatient 27.8%, rehabilitation facility – outpatient 48.0%, mental health center – outpatient
29.1%, emergency room 9.4%, private doctor's office 18.3%, self-help group 50.3, and prison 8.4%. The share of
treatment received in a specialty treatment facility is 59% when considering hospital, rehabilitation facility –
inpatient, rehabilitation facility – outpatient, and mental health center – outpatient as specialty care. Many mental
health centers also deliver specialty substance abuse treatment given the high degree of comorbidity across these
two conditions. For example in the 2015 National Survey on Substance Abuse Treatment Services, which is
administrated by SAMHSA and collects detailed service offering information on the near universe of licensed
specialty substance abuse treatment facilities, 34% of facilities list mental health as their primary focus. More

an excellent review of this literature. While consensus has not been reached on the relationship
between recessions and substance use, a series of economic studies provides convincing
evidence that substance abuse, at least for several substances including alcohol and opioids,
increases during recessions. Given that we focus on admissions to specialty substance abuse
treatment, the linkage of substance abuse and recessions is most important for our purposes.
Davalos, Fang, and French (2012) leverage data from the 2001/02 and 2004/05 National
Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and show that a one
percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate leads to 1.17 greater odds of alcohol
abuse and/or dependence. Using internet search data Frijters et al. (2013) document that during
recessions searches for alcohol abuse-related terms increase. In particular, the authors show that
a 5% increase in unemployment leads to a 15% increase in searches for alcohol abuse-related
terms. Carpenter, McClellan, and Rees (2017) draw data from the 2002 to 2013 National Survey
of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to explore how drug abuse responds to recession. Although
Carpenter and colleagues findings were somewhat mixed, they show that the abuse of analgesics
and hallucinogens increases during recessions. Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon (2017) find
that a 1 percentage point increase in the county unemployment rate leads to a 3.6% increase in
the opioid overdose death rate and a 7.0% increase in the opioid-related emergency department
(ED) rate, which proxies for non-fatal opioid overdoses. The authors show comparable, although
somewhat smaller, increases in overall drug-related overdose deaths and ED visits during
recessions, suggesting that the increases in substance-abuse related overdoses and ED visits are
not limited to opioids. Overall, the economic evidence suggests that during recessions substance
abuse, across a range of substances, increases and thus need for treatment may also increase.

9

In terms of the impact of recessions on substance abuse treatment, there are two related
epidemiological studies. Storti et al. (2011) evaluate how outpatient illicit drug treatment
respond to recessions in Europe. The authors find that admissions decline modestly during
recessions. Cantor, Stoller, and Saloner (2017) assess the effect of state unemployment rates on
treatment settings, accepted payment forms, charity care, offered services, special programs, and
use of pharmacotherapies by U.S. specialty substance abuse treatment providers. The authors
find that an increase in the unemployment rate leads lower patient volumes (measured by the
number of patients treated per day) and an increase in acceptance of private insurance.
We build on the premise established by the extant economic and epidemiological studies
by investigating admissions to specialty treatment and heterogeneity across substances of abuse.
Of additional importance is that we utilize 24 years of data to explore these relationships.
Access to a long time-series is critical from a methodological standpoint as it helps establish the
presence of a relationship as described in Ruhm (2015). Indeed, Ruhm cautions that reliance on
shorter time-series (less than 15 years) can lead to biased parameter estimates.
3. Data and methods
3.1 Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS)
We utilize data on admissions to specialty SUD treatment from the TEDS 1992-2015.
The TEDS is an administrative database compiled annually by the U.S. government in
collaboration with state substance abuse agencies. TEDS includes information on roughly two
million admissions to specialty substance treatment each year, and contains nearly the universe
of specialty substance abuse treatment facilities that receive financing from the state or federal
government, are certified by the state to provide specialty substance treatment, or are tracked for

10

some other reason. Within this dataset we focus on specialty substance abuse treatment. 8 Note
that because of this data feature, we do not capture substance abuse treatment received in private
doctors’ offices or self-help treatment, or providers that accept only cash and/or private health
insurance. 9 Moreover there are some differences across states in terms of what admissions are
reported to TEDS (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2016).
In our view, even with the above-noted caveats in mind, the TEDS are the best available
data to examine how admissions to specialty substance treatment in the U.S. responds to
recessions. Indeed, the TEDS are commonly employed within the economics literature to study
specialty substance abuse treatment (Anderson 2010; Jena and Goldman 2011; Dave and
Mukerjee 2011; Saloner et al. 2017; Powell, Pacula, and Jacobson 2015; Maclean and Saloner
2017; Pacula et al. 2015) and are utilized by the Federal government to estimate the costs of
substance abuse treatment to the U.S. economy (Office of National Drug Control Policy 2012).
Moreover, Gfroerer et al. (2014) document that the demographics of patients in receiving care in
TEDS-tracked facilities are comparable to individuals receiving substance abuse treatment in the
nationally representative NSDUH. These findings suggest that the TEDS are generalizable to the
specialty substance abuse treatment-seeking population in the U.S., which is precisely our target
population. Finally, the TEDS are available over a long time period (1992-2015) and contain
consistent measures of substance abuse treatment, these data features are important for studying
the health effects of recessions (Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017; Ruhm 2015).

8
The specific settings in the TEDS are as follows: detoxification (hospital, ambulatory, or free standing facility);
rehabilitation/residential programs in hospitals, short-term (<30 days), or long-term (>30 days), ambulatory
intensive or non-intensive (intensive is treatment ‘lasting two or more hours per day for three or more days per
week’; non-intensive is ‘treatment services including individual, family, and/or group services, and may include
pharmacological therapies).
9
Unless these providers operate in a state that requires reporting to TEDS for some reason.

11

The 1992 to 2015 TEDS include 42,901,509 specialty substance abuse treatment
episodes, the number of episodes per year are reported in Appendix Table 1. An episode can
include detoxification services only, outpatient care, or inpatient care received in a hospital or
free-standing residential facility. We refer to each specialty substance abuse episode as an
‘admission’; although we realize that some episodes may not lead to an actual admission.
We exclude admissions that occur outside the 50 states and D.C., and for which the
primary substance is missing or not listed. A non-trivial fraction of the TEDS admissions are
referred to treatment from the criminal justice system; roughly 39% during our study period. In
our core analyses, we report results based on the full sample of admissions, regardless of referral
source. We are concerned that during recessions public financing for policing services may
decline which could alter the number or composition of admissions referred from the criminal
justice system. Selecting our sample on referral source could lead therefore to conditional-onpositive bias in our regression coefficient estimates. However, admissions referred from the
criminal justice system are more likely to be coerced than voluntary and thus are less likely to be
determined by factors outlined in traditional economic models of consumer choice (Dave and
Mukerjee 2011). To explore this possibility, in robustness checking, we report results generated
in the sample of admissions not referred from the criminal justice system and document that our
findings are not sensitive to excluding criminal justice system admissions.
We aggregate the TEDS to the state/year level for computational ease. Not all states
report information in all years. Appendix Table 1 reports the states not reporting to TEDS by
year, this number ranges zero to five. We measure the total number of admissions and total
number of admissions by substance of abuse. Specifically, we construct separate admission
counts (based on the primary substance listed at admission) for alcohol, cocaine, marijuana,

12

heroin, prescription opioids (e.g., prescription opioid pain relievers such as oxycontin),
hallucinogens, stimulants, sedatives, tranquilizers, inhalants, and substances not classified
elsewhere (e.g., other-the-counter medications and ketamine). Appendix Table 2 lists substances
included in each category. We convert admissions counts to rates per 100,000 residents in the
state using population data from the U.S. Census (University of Kentucky Center for Poverty
Research Center 2016). We take the logarithm of each outcome variable to address skewness
(our outcomes are highly left skewed), thus regression coefficient estimates have the
interpretation as an approximation to the percent change.
3.2 Economic conditions data
Our proxy for economic conditions is the annual state unemployment rate from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Rate Database. 10 This variable is a
standard measure of economic activity within the literature that explores the effect of recessions
on health outcomes, in particular studies examining substance abuse (Ruhm 2000;
Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017; Lindo 2015; Carpenter, McClellan, and Rees 2017).
3.3 State-level characteristics
Admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment are determined by myriad factors
outside the prevailing economic conditions. We attempt to control for such factors in our
regression models. In particular, we seek to include factors that are correlated with both
admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment and economic conditions in efforts to mitigate

10

As noted by Lindo (2015) there are inherent trade-offs in selecting the level of aggregation for analyses of the
effect of recessions on health. We choose to use the state over more dis-aggregated measures (e.g., county) for two
reasons. (i) We are concerned that, due to limited supply of substance abuse treatment (Buck 2011), many
individuals may seek treatment outside of a smaller geographic unit, and our data only allow us to observe where the
patient receives treatment, not where the patient resides. Thus, a smaller unit of aggregation may lead to
measurement error. (ii) As we note later in the manuscript, the smallest geographic unit available in the public use
TEDS is the Core-Based Statistical Area and this measure is not defined for rural areas (<10,000 residents), leading
us to omit rural treatment. We return to this issue more formally in robustness checking reported in Section 5.

13

omitted variable bias in our regression coefficients. We include variables that proxy for state
preferences towards substances and addiction treatment: marijuana decriminalization (Pacula,
Chriqui, and King 2003), 11 legalization of medical marijuana (Sabia and Nguyen 2016), and a
prescription drug monitoring program (Ali et al. 2017). We include two policies that arguably
capture social preferences toward providing support for vulnerable populations (the maximum
monthly Temporary Aid for Needy Families [TANF] for a family of four and the Earned Income
Tax Credit [EITC] state-to-federal ratio) and an indicator for a Democrat governor (University of
Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center 2016). Finally, we control for state demographics
from the Current Population Survey (Flood et al. 2017): age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education.
3.4 Methods
To estimate the impact of recessions on admissions to specialty substance abuse
treatment the following differences-in-differences we use the following regression model:
(1)

𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝑈𝑈𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 + 𝛼𝛼2′ 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + Ω𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

This model is comparable to specifications used in other recent analyses of the effects of
recessions on substance abuse outcomes (Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017; Carpenter,
McClellan, and Rees 2017). The dependent variables is 𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 , which represents an admission

outcome in state s in year t. In terms of explanatory variables, 𝑈𝑈𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 is the unemployment rate in
state s in year t, and 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is a vector of time-varying state demographics and policies. 12 Finally,
𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 is a vector of state fixed effects, 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 is a vector of year fixed effects, Ω𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is a state-specific

linear time trend, 13 and 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the error term. We estimate all regressions with (unweighted)

OLS and standard errors are clustered around the state (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004).

11

We thank Rosalie Pacula for sharing an updated version of the marijuana decriminalization coding scheme.
Results are not appreciably different if we remove the vector of observable state characteristics.
13
That is we interact each state fixed effect with a linear time trend that takes on the value of 1 in 1992, 2 in 1993,
and so forth.
12

14

The appropriate lag structure between admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment
and the state unemployment rate in our context is not obvious ex ante. Previous literature on
recessions and substance abuse shows that changes in the current unemployment rate are linked
with changes in substance abuse (Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017; Carpenter, McClellan,
and Rees 2017). We hypothesize that changes in the unemployment rate first leads to changes in
substance abuse which then, after some period of time, leads to changes in admissions to
substance abuse treatment. Hence, in our primary specification, we chose to lag the
unemployment rate by one year. However, in robustness checking we also report results using
alternative lag structures (no lag, two lags, and three lags).
4. RESULTS
4.1 Summary statistics and trends
Before proceeding to our main analyses, we provide some descriptive evidence on the
characteristics of patients receiving specialty substance abuse treatment within TEDS-tracked
facilities. Specifically, we examine age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, employment status,
living arrangements, prior receipt of substance abuse treatment, and referral source. Results are
reported in Table 1. Overall these statistics suggest that patients receiving care in TEDS-tracked
facilities are less advantaged than the general U.S. population. For instance, 79% have a high
school diploma or less, 69% are unemployed or not in the labor force, and 35% are homeless or
reside in a supervised living facility. The sample is relatively young, 96% is less than 55 years
of age. The sample is more racially diverse than the U.S. population as whole. Finally, a
majority (54%) of the sample has received previous specialty substance abuse treatment and 39%
is referred to treatment through the criminal justice system.

15

Table 2 reports summary statistics for our outcome and control variables. Admissions to
specialty substance abuse treatment are 674 per 100,000 over our study period. Alcohol is the
most commonly reported substance of abuse at admission (345 per 100,000) followed by
marijuana (97 per 100,000), heroin (80 per 100,000), cocaine (68 per 100,000), stimulants (41
per 100,000), prescription opioids (33 per 100,000), sedatives (5 per 100,000), hallucinogens (2
per 100,000), and inhalants (1 per 100,000). There are 3 admissions per 100,000 for other drugs
not otherwise classified. The mean lagged state unemployment rate is 5.7%. In terms of
policies, 25% of state/year pairs have decriminalized marijuana over this time period, 18%
permit medical marijuana, and 49% have implemented prescription drug monitoring programs.
We report trends in the total number of admissions per 100,000 to specialty substance
abuse treatment in Figure 1. We observe that admissions are relatively flat 1992 to 2005,
ranging between 650 and 700 admissions per 100,000. Over the period 2006 to 2010 admissions
surge, peaking at nearly 750 per 100,000 in 2009/2010. This is a period in which prescription
opioid drug abuse increased rapidly. Admissions decline monotonically over the period 2011 to
2014 followed by an uptick in 2015.
Figure 2 reports the average lagged state unemployment rate during our study period
(1992 to 2015, thus unemployment rates correspond to the period 1991 to 2014). This period
encompasses three recessions: the mild recessions of 1991-1992 and 2001-2002, and the severe
recession (‘Great Recession’) of 2008-2010 (National Bureau of Economic Research 2010). In
addition, we capture two growth periods: the mid- to late-1990s and the mid-2000s. Our study
period also includes the recovery from the 2008-2010 recession. Thus, we are able to leverage a
broad range of variation in economic conditions in our study. 14

14

Of course, because we rely on differences-in-difference regression models, the variation we use for identification
of treatment effects is within-state variation.

16

Comparing trends in admissions and the lagged state unemployment rate (i.e., Figures 1
and 2) does not reveal an obvious relationship between the two variables. However, we next to
turn to our regression analysis to study this question more rigorously and to explore
heterogeneity across substances of abuse.
4.2 Admissions regressions
Table 3 reports selected results from our differences-in-differences analyses of
admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment. When considering all substances, we find no
statistically significant evidence that recessions lead to changes in the number of admissions to
specialty substance abuse treatment. Although the coefficient estimate is negative (-0.017)
suggesting that total admissions may decline during recessions.
In terms of heterogeneity across substances, for the majority of the substances we
consider there is no statistically significant evidence that recessions lead to changes in
admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment. In particular, there is no statistically
significant effect for alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, prescription opioids, hallucinogens, sedatives,
and inhalants. As is the case when we consider all substances, the majority of coefficient
estimates are negative which suggests that recessions may lead to declines in admissions.
There are three exceptions to this pattern, however. We find a statistically significant
decrease in admissions for heroin (a one percentage point increase in the lagged state
unemployment rate leads to an 8.4% decrease in admissions for this substance), a statistically
significant increase in admissions for stimulants (a one percentage point increase in the lagged
state unemployment rate leads to a 7.0% increase in admissions for this substance), and
admissions substances not classified elsewhere (a one percentage point increase in the lagged
state unemployment rate leads to a 6.9% decline in admissions for such substances).

17

While the underlying mechanisms behind this heterogeneity across substances (similar
heterogeneity has been identified in other studies such as Carpenter, McClellan, and Rees (2017)
and Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon (2017)) is obviously important for both policymakers and
providers, the TEDS data will not allow us to fully investigate this important question. However,
we can propose hypotheses that may, at least partially, explain the observed heterogeneity.
First, there may be substance substitution effects associated with recessions; that is
individuals may abuse different substances at different points of the business cycle due to factors
such as income, price, or access. Second, different types of individuals abuse different types of
substances; for example those who abuse marijuana may simply differ from those who abuse
heroin, stimulants, and other substances. These groups may – for myriad reasons such as
employment or insurance coverage – respond differently to recessions in terms of their demand
for specialty substance abuse treatment. Third, the decline in heroin admissions may be due to
increased mortality among heroin abusers during recessions (Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon
2017). Fourth, there may be differences in risk for treatment across substances. For example,
stimulants include methamphetamine, which is linked with violent behavior and paranoia that
can plausibly be easily observed by others (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2017), leading to a
higher transition rate from abuse into treatment for stimulants than other substances.
5. Robustness checks
We next report results of several robustness checks that probe the sensitivity of our
findings to alternative specifications.
5.1 Dynamics
In our core regression models we use the contemporaneous state unemployment rate.
However, the specific timing between changes in economic conditions and changes in demand

18

for specialty substance abuse treatment is ex ante unknown. To explore the stability of our
results to different lag structures, we re-estimate Equation (1) using the contemporaneous
unemployment rate, two year lags in this rate, and three year lags in this rate. We report results
in Appendix Table 3. Our finding for all substances is largely unchanged across models that
employ alternative lag structures: coefficient estimates range from -0.0103 to -0.0282, suggesting
that admissions may decline during recessions, but are imprecise in all specifications.
Our finding that heroin (substances not classified elsewhere) admissions decline
(increase) during recessions is stable across specifications: coefficients range from -0.0580 to 0.0791 (-0.0547 to -0.0867; although the coefficient is not precise when the contemporaneous
unemployment rate is used). The coefficient estimate in the stimulant admission regression is
similar when we use the contemporaneous unemployment rate (𝛼𝛼�1 = 0.0776) but decreases in

magnitude and becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero when we apply more distal lags
in the unemployment rate (two and three). Interestingly, when we apply more distal lag
structures (two and three lags) we find stronger, and precisely estimated, evidence that
admissions for marijuana, prescription opioids, hallucinogens, and inhalants decline when the
state unemployment rate increases. As noted earlier, the particular time dynamics between
recessions and admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment is unknown ex ante.
5.2 Alternative controls for between-state differences
Equation (1) utilizes observable state characteristics (e.g., demographics), state fixedeffects, and state-specific linear time trends to account for between-state heterogeneity.
However, the ideal specification is unknown a-priori. If there are no omitted variables at the
state-level that are correlated with both the state unemployment rate and admissions to specialty
substance abuse treatment, then this empirical specification would ‘throw away’ a substantial

19

degree of variation in state unemployment rates. On the other hand, if our controls do not
adequately account for between-state heterogeneity, then our estimates may be biased.
To explore this possibility, we re-estimate Equation (1) using alternative controls for
between state differences. First, we control for state-level policies and demographics, year fixed
effects, and state fixed effects (Model 1). Second, we control for state-level policies and
demographics, year fixed effects, state fixed-effects, and state-specific quadratic time trends
(Model 2). Results are reported in Appendix Table 4. Overall, the parameter estimates are in
line with our main findings (Table 3). Not surprisingly, the estimated regression coefficients are
larger (smaller) in specifications that offer more (less) ability to control for heterogeneity.
5.3 Alternative measures of economic conditions
In our main analyses we use the state unemployment rate to proxy for economic
conditions. However, Lindo (2015) shows that analyses of economic conditions can be sensitive
to the level at which these conditions are measured. In particular, analyses that rely on statelevel measures tend to produce larger coefficient estimates than analyses that rely on lower levels
of aggregation. Thus, in addition to the above robustness checks for economic conditions we
also re-estimate Equation (1) using the unemployment rate specified at the finest level of
aggregation available in the TEDS: the Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA). Note that this
variable is not available for rural areas (<10,000 residents), and thus we lose roughly 25% of our
sample. In these models we replace the state fixed effects and the state-specific trends with
CBSA equivalents. Given well established shortages of specialty substance abuse treatment
(Carr et al. 2008; Buck 2011) and in particular within rural communities (Hyde 2013), relying on
smaller areas may not accurately reflect the treatment facilities patients consider when they are
determining where to receive substance abuse treatment.

20

Results from this analysis are reported in Appendix Table 5. Findings are broadly in line
with our main findings (see Table 3). However, as documented by Lindo, the estimates are
generally smaller when we use finer levels of aggregation and less likely to be statistically
different from zero. Interestingly, we find that the estimate for prescription opioid admissions is
precisely estimated: a one percentage point increase in the lagged unemployment rate leads to a
1.3% increase in admissions for this substance.
5.4 Non-criminal justice system referrals
Thus far in our analysis we include all admissions, regardless of referral source.
However, admissions from the criminal justice system may be less responsive to changes in
factors outlined in models of consumer choice (Dave and Mukerjee 2011). We next re-estimate
Equation (1) excluding admissions referred through the criminal justice system. We note that, if
policing budgets decline during recessions, then the number and composition of individuals
referred through criminal justice system sources may be altered, which could lead to conditionalon-positive bias. With this caveat in mind, we report results from this restricted analysis sample
in Appendix Table 6. Results are not appreciably different from our main findings (Table 3).
5.5 Population weighting
Our results thus far are unweighted. However, there is some controversy within the
economics literature as to whether weights should be applied in analyses seeking to recover
causal estimates (Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge 2015; Angrist and Pischke 2009). Thus, we
estimate a weighted variant of Equation (1). More specifically, we use the state population to
weight this equation. Results are reported in Appendix Table 7 and are not appreciably different
from unweighted results; although we note that the estimated coefficients are somewhat smaller.
5.6 Balanced sample

21

Our results presented thus far are based on the unbalanced sample (Appendix Table 1).
However, it is plausible that economic conditions could lead to changes in the propensity for
states to report specialty substance abuse treatment admissions data to SAMSHA, leading to
year-to-year changes in the composition of states in our sample that is linked to our treatment
variable (state unemployment rates). Hence, we re-estimate our regression models on the
balanced sample (i.e., the sample of states that appear in TEDS in all years). Results are reported
in Appendix Table 8 and are not appreciably different from our main findings. However, we
note that the stimulant admissions coefficient is no longer precise.
5.7 Other robustness checks
We focus our analysis on specialty substance abuse treatment, which reflects several
modalities of treatment but not a complete enumeration of treatment options available to patients.
It is plausible that other modalities (e.g., self-help or office-based care) are more responsive to
recessions than specialty care. To explore this possibility we examine two additional data sets:
(i) the NESARC 2001/2002 and 2004/2005 to study the effects of economic conditions on nonspecialty substance abuse treatment 15 and (ii) the Medicaid State Drug Use Database (SDUD)
and examine Food and Drug Administration approved prescription medications used to treat
substance abuse within Medicaid (Maclean and Saloner 2017; Mark et al. 2015). 16 Neither of
these datasets produce results that recessions lead to changes in these forms of treatment.
Results are available on request from the corresponding author.

Defined as Alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous; family or social service agency; detoxification ward or clinic;
emergency room; halfway house or therapeutic community; crisis center; employee assistance program; religious
leader; private physician, psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, or other professional; and other.
16
We note that neither of these extensions is optimal. The NESARC is limited to just two time periods covering a
relatively strong economic period and the SDUD covers prescription medications purchased through online and
retail pharmacies for which Medicaid was a third-party paper; thus these data allow us to study the Medicaid
population only. However, examining whether use of these forms of treatment within these time periods and
populations can shed light on the extent which our focus on specialty substance abuse treatment limits our analysis.

22

6. Discussion
Health economists have examined the complex relationship between recessions and
health and health behaviors for over two decades (Ruhm 1995, 2015, 2000). However, to the
best of our knowledge, only a handful of studies have explored the relationship between
economic conditions and measures of substance abuse in the U.S. (Davalos, Fang, and French
2012; Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017; Frijters et al. 2013; Carpenter, McClellan, and
Rees 2017), and no studies have investigated the relationship between recessions and admissions
to specialty substance abuse treatment. The available literature on substance abuse and
recessions suggests that, for a broad set substances, there is evidence that substance abuse
worsens during economic downturns. In this study, we evaluate the corresponding impact of
recessions on admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment in the U.S. All else equal, we
expect an increase in substance abuse to translate into increased admissions. However, due to
numerous factors related to the nature of substance abuse, patients receiving substance abuse
treatment, and substance abuse treatment delivery system, this relationship is ex ante unclear.
When we consider all substances collectively, we find no statistically significant evidence
that changes in economic conditions leads to changes in admissions to specialty substance abuse
treatment. However, aggregating across substances of abuse masks important and policy
relevant heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that admissions for heroin and other drugs not classified
elsewhere decline while admissions for simulants increase during recessions.
In interpreting these results a number of limitations should be noted. First, admissions to
substance abuse treatment is a function of both supply and demand. Our reduced form methods
cannot separate supply from demand side factors. It is plausible that during recessions public
financing – the primary source of funding – available for specialty substance abuse treatment

23

may decline which prevents individuals from entering treatment and, based on the economic
studies discussed earlier, that substance abuse increases during recessions. Second, the
substance abuse treatment providers in the TEDS disproportionally receive public financing.
Thus, the extent to which our findings generalize to other settings is unclear. However, given
that specialty substance abuse treatment is heavily supported by the public sector we suspect that
our findings are potentially generalizable to a large share of the specialty care that is delivered.
Indeed, Dave and Mukerjee (2011) state that TEDS captures approximately 67% of such
providers. Finally, we do not have objective measures quality of care, expenditures, and length
of stay. Thus, we cannot explore how quality or intensity of treatment changes across the
business cycle. However, recent epidemiological work by Cantor, Stoller, and Saloner (2017)
does not imply that there are large changes in quality of care across the business cycle. 17
Given these limitations, policymakers and providers may find our results useful.
Recessions may lead to increases in untreated substance abuse which can, in turn, lead to
increases in mortality and social costs such as crime, healthcare use, and poor employment
outcomes. For example, Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon (2017) show that during recessions
overdose deaths increase. While we cannot fully test this hypothesis, it is plausible given that
there are effective methods available to treat addiction (Volkow et al. 2014; Swensen 2015;
Murphy and Polsky 2016), that expanded substance abuse treatment may have prevented some of
these deaths. Thus, directing government resources toward substance abuse treatment during
recessions may have social benefits.

17

However, we note that measuring quality of substance abuse treatment in available datasets is challenging.
