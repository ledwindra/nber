    "abstract": "\n\nAlthough corporate finance theory suggests how adverse shocks influence shareholder preferences toward corporate risk-taking and executive compensation, few researchers explore this relationship empirically. We construct a firm-year measure of unexpected shocks to environmental regulatory stringency. We find that adverse environmental regulatory shocks typically prompt corporate boards to reduce the risk-taking incentives of CEO compensation. However, this pattern is not uniform. Financially distressed firms exhibit milder reductions in compensation convexity, with some even increasing it, suggesting a \u201cgambling for resurrection\u201d strategy. Moreover, the strength of corporate governance influences shareholders\u2019 capacity to align executive incentives with changing shareholder risk preferences.\n\n",
