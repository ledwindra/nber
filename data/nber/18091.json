    "abstract": "\n\nWill fast growing emerging economies sustain rapid growth rates until they \"catch-up\" to the technology frontier? Are there incentives for some developed countries to free-ride off of innovators and optimally \"fallback\" relative to the frontier? This paper models agents growing as a result of investments in innovation and imitation. Imitation facilitates technology diffusion, with the productivity of imitation modeled by a catch-up function that increases with distance to the frontier. The resulting equilibrium is an endogenous segmentation between innovators and imitators, where imitating agents optimally choose to \"catch-up\" or \"fall-back\" to a productivity ratio below the frontier.\n\n",
