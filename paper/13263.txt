Fertility and the Real Exchange Rate

NBER Working Paper No. 13263

JEL No. F32,J13
ABSTRACT
We use a quinquennial data set covering 87 countries between 1975 and 2005 to investigate the relationship
between fertility and the real effective exchange rate. Theoretically a country experiencing a decline
in its fertility rate can be expected to have higher savings, lower investment, a current account surplus,
and accordingly a real depreciation. We test and confirm this hypothesis, controlling for a host of
potential determinants such as PPP deviations and the Balassa-Samuelson effect. We find a statistically
significant and robust link between fertility and the exchange rate. Our point-estimate is that a decline
in the fertility rate of one child per woman is associated with a depreciation of approximately .15%
in the real effective exchange rate.

1. Introduction
Massive demographic changes are in play across the world. UN data show that average
world life expectancy rose from 59.9 years in 1975-1980 to 65.4 just twenty-five years later, an
increase of 9.2%. Even more dramatically, the fertility rate (average births per woman) fell from
3.92 to 2.65 during the same period of time, a larger change of some 48%. This paper is
concerned with the consequences of such demographic issues for international finance. In
particular, we ask “What effect does the fertility rate have on the real exchange rate?”
The theoretical linkage between the fertility rate and the real exchange rate seems
intuitive. Suppose the fertility rate declines for some exogenous reason (e.g., an improvement in
female education or a decrease in the cost of contraception). Life-Cycle theory argues that childrearing is associated with increased consumption and thus reduced savings (children tend to
consume more than they produce); a drop in fertility can be expected to raise savings.
Investment may also drop if there is a decline in the future equilibrium capital stock resulting
from a smaller populace. If savings rise and investment falls, the current account improves and a
real depreciation of the exchange rate is part of the equilibrium response to an exogenous decline
in fertility. This much seems straightforward (though there is dispute; more on this below).
However, as with so many theories concerning exchange rates, the real question is whether these
theoretical implications are borne out empirically or remain blurred by a myriad of other factors.
This paper is an exploratory data analysis of the linkage between fertility and the exchange rate.
We gather a broad long panel of data that covers 87 countries between 1975 and 2005, a
sample of great demographic change and cross-country heterogeneity. Unlike many theoretical
predictions for exchange rates, ours seems borne out by the data. We find a strong link between
the real effective exchange rate and the fertility rate. We use fixed-effects panel methods, and

1

account for a number of other reasons why exchange rates adjust, including deviations from
Purchasing Power Parity, the Balassa-Samuelson effect, the effects of trade liberalization,
government spending, net foreign assets, and so on. Yet we still find that a 1-point decline in the
fertility rate is associated with a real effective depreciation of around .15%. This result seems
sensible and plausible; it is also quite robust.
In section 2 we provide a brief survey of the literature; this section can be skipped
without loss. Our data set and methodology are presented in section 3, while section 4 contains
our key results. Section 5 presents extensive sensitivity analysis, followed by a brief
examination of other demographic phenomena. The paper closes with a brief conclusion.

2. Quick Survey of the Literature
Most research that studies the macroeconomic effects of demographic change is
concerned with these phenomena at a national level. For instance, there is a lively debate
concerning the implications of demographic shifts for stock and bond returns; see, e.g., Poterba
(2004). Nevertheless, a strand of the literature has developed recently that is concerned with the
implications of demographic changes for the global economy. Two recent references of value
are FRB Kansas City (2004) and Reserve Bank of Australia (2006); see also the excellent survey
by Bosworth et al (2004).
It seems unnecessary to develop another theoretical model to link fertility to savings,
investment, and the real exchange rate, since these interactions have been well explored in the
literature. For instance, Higgins and Williamson (1996) use an overlapping generations model of
growth to explore the impact of demographics on savings and the macroeconomy. Their model
is entirely conventional except that instead of two it has three periods of life (youth, prime-age,

2

and the elderly); a sketch of their model is provided in an appendix. They show that higher
steady-state fertility lowers savings, raises investment and thus leads to current account deficits.
They also show that the same predictions describe the early stages of a typical “demographic
transition” where fertility rises before falling (as seems to characterize the postwar period for
many countries).
While an appreciation seems the likely result of increased fertility, the theoretical impact
of increased fertility on the real exchange rate is not undisputed. Bryant et al (2004) develop a
two-country model which implies that the real exchange rate may be expected to depreciate in
the long run following a fertility increase. Cantor and Driskill (2000) show that the sign of the
effect depends on whether or not the country is a net debtor; see also the references in Bosworth
et al (2004).1 In this paper, we add to the debate by using empirical rather than theoretical
techniques.
Indeed, most of the existing work in this area is theoretical, often using simulation
techniques for quantification. For instance, Bryant et al (2004) use simulation methods to study
the effects of fertility declines in the international economy, and find that in their model a decline
in fertility leads to a real appreciation; see also Bosworth et al (2004) and Bryant (2004, 2006).
Boersh-Supan et al (2001 use simulations to study pension reform and international capital flows
that stem from population aging in a multi-country overlapping generations model. Feroli (2003)
also uses theory and simulation techniques and finds that demographic differences can explain
much of the size and timing of some key current account imbalances.
The extant empirical work that estimates the effects of demographic changes tends to be
concerned with macroeconomic quantities (such as the current account, or savings and
investment rates) rather than international prices. For instance, Higgins (1998) uses a cross-

3

country panel and finds strong evidence that demographic changes are correlated with current
accounts. In particular, his evidence is consistent with standard theory that predicts declines in
savings with the proportions of both the young and the elderly in the population; see also Domeij
and Flodén (2004), Helliwell (2004), and Herbertsson and Zoega (1999). Kim and Lee (2005)
find that increases in the proportion of dependents in the population lead to decreased savings
and deteriorated current accounts using G-7 data and time-series techniques.
The closest antecedents to our paper are by Andersson and Österholm. In their (2005)
paper, Andersson and Österholm use Swedish data and time-series techniques and find that using
the distribution of the Swedish population across cohorts helps both determine and forecast the
real exchange rate. Their analysis is bivariate and includes no real exchange rate determinants
other than the age distribution. In Andersson and Österholm (2006), they extend the analysis to
25 OECD countries and use a panel of annual data. Again, they find some consistency between
life-cycle theory and the effects of the age distribution on the real exchange rate. However, the
age distribution does not help in forecasting the exchange rate, and some of their results are
sensitive. They consider only one economic control, namely the real interest rate differential,
which can be linked theoretically to the change in the real exchange rate. By way of contrast,
our approach is medium-run in design, and is more focused on the effects of fertility on the
exchange rate level. We cover a broader panel of countries, and allow for a large number of
alternative real exchange rate determinants; we also conduct extensive sensitivity analysis.

3. Methodology
We estimate the following equation as our default:

4

log(reer)it = βfertit + γ1PPPit + γ2y/yusit + γ3openit + γ4TLit + γ5G/Yit
+ γ6growthit + γ7log(pop)it + γ8log(y)it + Σtφt + Σiθi + eit

(1)

where
•

log(reer)it is the natural logarithm of the average real effective CPI exchange rate for
country i over quinquennial time period t (taken from IFS),

•

fert is the fertility rate measured in children per woman (UN),

•

PPP is the deviation from purchasing power parity relative to the United States (PWT),

•

y/yus is the ratio of current per capita GDP relative to the United States (PWT),

•

open is the ratio of exports plus imports to GDP (PWT),

•

TL is a measure of trade liberalization (Wacziarg-Welch),

•

G/Y is the government share of GDP (PWT),

•

growth is the growth rate of GDP (PWT),

•

pop is the population (PWT)

•

y is the level of real GDP per capita measured in international $ (PWT),

•

{γ} is a set of nuisance coefficients,

•

{φ} is a set of time-specific effects,

•

{θ} is a set of country-specific effects, and

•

e is a well-behaved disturbance term.

The coefficient of interest to us is β, the effect of fertility on the log real effective
exchange rate. We estimate this reduced-form equation with least squares, including
comprehensive sets of both time- and country-specific fixed effects. Thus, ours is a “within”

5

estimator that accounts for time-invariant national phenomena (e.g., political institutions or
geographic features). We are also allowing for phenomena that are common to a period of time
(e.g., oil prices and exchange rate misalignments) when we estimate our key coefficient. Thus β
can be interpreted as the exchange rate effect on a country when its fertility rate falls, holding the
global fertility rate constant.2
Our “default” equation includes all the usual suspects for medium- and long-run real
exchange rate determination; see, e.g., Drine and Rault (2001). The most important is the
deviation from purchasing power parity (PPP). There is still dispute as to whether there is a
strong tendency for real exchange rates to revert towards relative PPP, especially in the short- to
medium-run; Taylor and Taylor (2004) provide a recent survey. It is certainly safest to include
the deviation from PPP as a control rather than omit it and risk biasing our results while saving
only a single degree of freedom.3 We measure the PPP deviation using the Penn World Table
6.2 price level of GDP (mnemonic “P”), which is estimated purchasing power over GDP divided
by the actual exchange rate (times 100). Both are expressed relative to the United States (the
latter’s price level is equal to 100), so this is a bilateral measure of PPP. We use it with our
multilateral exchange rate index since a) the US is always one of the richest countries in the
sample, and b) we include period-specific fixed effects to take account of common shocks, such
as general fluctuations in the value of the American dollar. Since lower values represent a lower
cost of living (compared to the US), we expect γ1 to be positive.
Our second set of controls is intended to account for the much-discussed “BalassaSamuelson” effect. This links productivity growth in tradables to wage growth which then spills
out to wages and prices in the non-tradables sector. More generally, the Balassa-Samuelson
effect links development to real exchange rate appreciation. A number of variables have been

6

used as proxies for the effect; Froot and Rogoff (1994) provide a survey. Towards this end, we
include: 1) the ratio of national to American real GDP per capita (measured in international $); 2)
the log of real GDP per capita; and 3) the growth rate. Including real GDP per capita may also
be important since it is strongly negatively correlated with the fertility rate both across countries
and across time.
Above and beyond controls for PPP and the Balassa-Samuelson effect, we include four
other controls. These are: 1) openness (trade as a proportion of GDP); 2) a binary measure of
trade liberalization; 3) the log of the country’s population; and 4) the ratio of GDP spent directly
by the government. Open countries with more liberal trade may have lower prices and exchange
rates. Smaller countries may find it easier to pursue mercantilist exchange rate policy.
Government spending tends to be disproportionately non-traded as noted by Froot and Rogoff
(1994), so that the equilibrium real exchange rate may be a function of government size. There
is no overwhelming evidence that any of these variables play a consistently strong role in real
exchange rate determination in practice. Still, all are potentially relevant, and each has been
suggested in the literature as being of possible import.
While we pursue a considerable amount of sensitivity analysis below, it is not all of equal
interest. We often add two extra controls that are of particular relevance, and so create an
“augmented” model. The variables are: 1) the ratio of net foreign assets to GDP emphasized by
Cantor and Driskill (2000) and Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2004, 2006), and 2) the current account
imbalance, again measured as a percentage of GDP. Net foreign assets is a variable of
considerable appeal, since net debtors need in principle to have depreciated exchange rates to
generate the trade surpluses required to service debt payments. These variables are of theoretical
interest, but their inclusion reduces the sample size considerably.4

7

The Data Set
Almost all of our series are drawn from standard data sets; the sources are set out in an
appendix. The two biggest constraints we face are: a) the limited amount of comprehensive data
on demographic phenomena, and its overlap with b) the real effective exchange rate.
The Population Division of the United Nations provides series for a large number of
countries on life expectancy and the fertility rate. The changes in fertility rates during our
sample period are dramatic. For instance, the Spanish fertility rate fell from 2.6 (children per
woman) in 1975-1980 to only 1.3 in 2000-2005, while China’s fertility fell from 3.3 to 1.7
during the same period of time. Fertility rates are also uneven; during the 2000-2005 period,
both the Russian and Japanese fertility rates were 1.3, while that of Pakistan was 4.3 and the
Nigerian fertility rate was 5.9. The UN also provides the size of a country’s population both in
total and divided into 21 five-year age cohorts (ages 0-4, 5-9, etc.). All this is provided for the
entire populace, and each sex separately. The series are provided at five-year intervals and are
averaged over quinquennial periods (so that they span e.g., July 1975 through June 1980). The
series begin in 1950 and are forecast through 2050.
Figure 1 contains quinquennial box and whiskers plots for the fertility rate data we use.
The box covers the range of data between the 25th and 75th percentiles; the median is marked
inside the box with a bar (it is slightly lower than the global average); the whiskers extend out to
the rest of the distribution.5 Two distinct features of the data are apparent. First, fertility rates
are trending lower over time. Second, there is enormous cross-country variation in fertility. Our
methodology takes both phenomena into account.

8

The International Monetary Fund provides data on the real effective exchange rate
(REER) for over ninety countries through its International Financial Statistics database,
beginning in 1975. While six different variants are available, we rely on the only one available
for a large number of observations; it is based on relative CPIs (IFS mnemonic “rec”).6 This
variable is set such that 2000=100 for all countries; higher values represent more real
appreciation. The series have been checked and corrected for errors.
Real exchange rate series are available from 1975 through 2005 for 91 countries;
however the UN does not provide demographic data for four of these (Antigua & Barbuda,
Dominica, Grenada, and St. Kitts & Nevis). Accordingly, our sample consists of six
quinquennial observations for 87 countries between 1975 and 2005 for a maximum of 522
observations (though some are missing).7 This is a span of data that would be considered
appropriate for medium- or perhaps long-run analysis in international finance. However it is
approximately the length of a single generation, and thus can not reasonably capture long-run or
steady state equilibrium for demographic phenomena (such as those examined by Bryant, 2004,
2006). This is especially true since our data come from a period of time commonly considered to
be part of a demographic transition towards lower fertility rates. During this sample, 76 of the
87 countries experienced declines in fertility. Most of these falls were large; 55 were declines of
at least 25%. No country experienced a large increase in fertility.
The countries with both demographic and REER observations are tabulated in Appendix
Table A1. The top-left graph in Figure 2 contains a scatter of the REER plotted against the
fertility rate; immediately to the right is the analogue in natural logarithms. The wide dispersion
of the observations masks the positive unconditional correlation between the real exchange and
fertility rates. Accordingly, we scatter the log of the real exchange rate against the level of

9

fertility (the log-level specification that we use in much of our empirical work) in the lower-right
of the figure, but only after trimming the 5% outliers from both tails of both variables. Standard
tests reject the hypothesis of a unit-root in the (log-) real exchange rate for this panel.8
We use conventional sources for our other series. The Penn World Table 6.2 provides
series on: PPP-deviations, the ratio of national to American real GDP per capita, openness,
growth, population, the level of real GDP per capita, and the ratio of government spending to
output. The binary measure of trade liberalization is provided by Wacziarg and Welch (2003);
Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2006) provide net foreign assets. Further details are provided in a data
appendix, and some simple bivariate scatter-plots of the log REER against important control
regressors are provided in Figure 3. Descriptive statistics are provided in Appendix Table A2.
Simple correlation coefficients for both the default and augmented models are presented in
Appendix Table A3.

4. The Baseline
Our benchmark results are presented at the left-hand side of Table 1. Half of the control
variables are statistically significant. Reassuringly, the deviation from PPP is correctly
(positively) signed and highly significant with a t-ratio in excess of 12. More open and more
liberalized economies tend to have appreciated currencies, while growth is associated with
depreciation. The latter effect is opposite to what one would expect if the Balassa-Samuelson
term dominated the sample. However, neither of the income terms is particularly important; nor
is size or the government spending effect. It is difficult to explain variation in real exchange
rates across countries. The equation explains only a small fraction of the variation in the (log-)

10

real effective exchange rate. The within-country R2 is a respectable .68, but the betweencountries R2 is a dismal .01; the overall R2 is .only .1.
The most important result is tabulated in the top row, which presents β, the effect of the
fertility rate on the (log-) REER, ceteris paribus. Consistent with standard life-cycle theory, it is
positive; decreases of fertility from say 3 to 2 children per woman leads to a real depreciation of
.15%. This is of plausible economic size, being neither trivial nor incredibly large. It is of great
statistical significance, having a t-ratio of 5.9 and thus being different from zero at all confidence
levels.
The column immediately to the right augments the default specification by adding net
foreign assets and the current account imbalance, both measured as percentages of GDP. Neither
of these plausible variables turns out to have much relevance, though their inclusion reduces the
sample size. However, this has little effect on either the economic or statistical significance of
the fertility rate. The same is true in the four additional variants of the basic setup that are
tabulated to the right of the table. In all cases, the effect of fertility on the real exchange rate is
positive, and both economically and statistically significant.

5. Sensitivity Analysis
Table 2 contains the results of a large number of robustness checks intend to check
whether estimates of β are sensitive to our exact econometric methodology. We perturb the
model in over twenty ways, and present estimates for the fertility rate coefficient in both the
default model of Table 1 as well as the model augmented by the inclusion of net foreign assets
and the current account (nuisance coefficients are not reported to conserve space). Readers in a
hurry can skip this section; our key finding is robust.

11

We begin by adding other variables that are potential determinants of the real exchange
rate. While the nominal exchange rate regime is often linked to the volatility of the nominal
exchange rate in the short run, there is little evidence that it is tied to the level of the nominal
exchange rate over the medium run, let along the medium-run level of the real exchange rate.
Nevertheless, we have successively added dummy variables representing de jure fixed exchange
rate regimes (from Ghosh, Gulde and Wolf, 2002), and de facto fixed exchange rate regimes (we
use two standard measures, those of Reinhart and Rogoff, 2004 and Levy-Yeyati and
Sturzenegger).9 Next, we have separately added two standard measures of political institutions,
namely the Polity 2 measure of democracy, and also a measure of constraints on the executive
drawn from the same data set. Finally, we added a lagged dependent variable.10 However, none
of these additions much affects either the size or significance of our key coefficient. The same is
true of dropping either the time- or country-specific fixed effects.
We have also changed the estimation strategy in a number of ways. First, we model the
country-effects as random instead of fixed; this results in little substantive change, as does
weighting by either log-population or log-GDP. Our default equation models the natural
logarithm of the exchange rate as a function of the level of the fertility rate. We check this semilog model against both log-log and level-level alternatives, and find that they all result in
economically and statistically significant positive coefficients. We also checked whether the
exact data frequency is critical by moving from quinquennial to decadal averages. Again, we
find essentially similar results.
Finally we have cut the sample up in a number of different ways. First, we dropped all
observations with residuals that lie at least two standard deviations from zero. To check the
sensitivity of the results over time, we successively drop early and late observations, and also

12

present cross-sectional results for three separate years.11 We then used the World Bank’s
Country Classifications to group our countries by region, allowing us to drop successively
developing countries from: 1) Latin America and the Caribbean; 2) Europe and Central Asia; 3)
the Middle East and North Africa, 4) Sub-Saharan Africa; 5) East Asia; and 6) South Asia. We
separately also drop all high-income countries. However, none of these checks shake our
confidence in the basic result. The effect of the fertility rate on the log of the real effective
exchange rate is always estimated to be positive, with a semi-elasticity of around .15. Almost all
the estimates of β reported in Table 2 are precisely estimated and significantly different from
zero; it is never significantly negative.

Non-Linearities in the Relationship
We can see little evidence in the data of any particular non-linear relationship between
the real exchange rate and fertility. The lower-left graph of figure 2 is a scatter-plot of the log
real effective exchange rate against the fertility rate, after each variable has had the effects of all
the other controls removed.12 There are few indications of any economically sensible
relationship more complicated than that of linearity, and indeed simple checks for asymmetric
effects of fertility increases/decreases deliver nothing. Nevertheless, in Figure 4 we plot the
fitted values of a non-parametric relationship between the (log of the real effective) exchange
and fertility rates, once all other effects have been purged through linear regressions.13 Most of
the fitted values fit inside the +/- 2 standard error confidence interval around the linear
relationship, which is also provided. We conclude that there is little evidence of any important
non-linearity in the relationship between fertility and the real exchange rate.14

13

Simultaneity/Measurement Error
We think that the fertility rate is plausibly exogenous with respect to the real exchange
rate. Nevertheless, it is easy to find good instrumental variables for fertility, since this has been
closely linked in the demographic literature to female education. For measures of the latter, we
take advantage of the updated Barro-Lee data set, which provides series on education at 5-year
intervals from 1960. We use combinations of three instrumental variables for the fertility rate: 1)
the percentage of 15+ females without schooling; 2) the percentage of 15+ females who attained
secondary school; and 3) the average years of school for 15+ females.15 Table 3 presents our IV
results for our default model, as well as two of its variants. We tabulate estimates of β when we
use all of three of the IVs (IV set 1), and then drop each of the three IVs one by one (thus IV set
2/3/4 drops the first/second/third IV.).
The IV estimates are all positive and significantly different from zero at conventional
levels. They tend to be about twice as large as the estimates from Tables 1-2, though they are
less precisely estimated. These instrumental variables are not weak; the smallest F-test for
excluding the IVs from the first-stage regression is significantly different from zero at the .004
level. Further, since we use three instrumental variables for one coefficient, we can test the
exclusion restrictions (using IV sets 2-4) by adding the dropped instrumental variables to the
second-stage equation one by one. When we do this, none of the IVs enter the exchange rate
equation significantly. Succinctly, our instrumental variables appear to satisfy both standard
requirements, and act to reinforce our finding of a positive linkage between the fertility and real
exchange rates.

6. Other Demographic Measures

14

While the focus of this paper is on the relationship between fertility and the real exchange
rate, we also briefly examine other demographic measures. In Table 4, we use the same default
model as in Tables 1-2, and merely substitute different demographic features in place of the
fertility rate. We find results that are, on the whole, consistent with those of fertility, but
substantially weaker. Our hypothesis is that an exogenous increase in fertility can be expected to
lower savings and perhaps raise investment, thereby causing a current account deficit and an
equilibrium real appreciation. Consistent with that, an increase in the birth rate or decreases in
infant or child mortality are also associated with appreciations. However, only the infant
mortality results are significantly different from zero.
The results from Table 4 show that increases in the ratio of either the young (below 20)
or elderly (above 65) as a proportion of the populace, or a decrease in the ratio of the active labor
force (20-65) are also associated with real appreciations. Again, while all these findings are
consistent with theory, none are significantly different from the hypothesis of no effect at all.
Still, such ratios are relatively coarse measures of the age distribution; finer detail is available
from the UN. We take advantage of the latter by modeling the effects on the real exchange rate
of the entire age distribution, the latter modeled by 21 age cohorts. We use the default empirical
model of Tables 1-2, but replace the fertility rate with the entire age distribution of the
population. In particular, we are interested in:

log(reer)it = β1prop1it + β2prop2it + … + β21prop21it
+ γ1PPPit + … + γ8log(y)it + Σtφt + Σiθi + eit

15

(1’)

To avoid multicollinearity, we use an unconstrained quadratic polynomial to parameterize the
cohort distribution; our technique follows Higgins (1998).16 That is we constrain βj = δ0 + δ1j +
δ2j2, so that we actually estimate:

log(reer)it = δ0Σjpropjit + δ1Σj(j*propjit) + δ2Σj(j2*propjit)
+ γ1PPPit + … + γ8log(y)it + Σtφt + Σiθi + eit

(1”)

The results are reported in Table 5. As the age distribution shifts towards the young (as
in a more fertile country), the real exchange rate appreciates. The effect dies off as older cohorts
become larger, and actually turns negative during the prime earning (and thus saving) years, and
eventually starts to turn around at the approximate age of retirement. All this is consistent with
life-cycle theory and the results of Andersson and Österholm (2006), though the level of
statistical confidence in these results is low.
We expect the real exchange rate to appreciate with an increase in fertility, since we
expect savings to fall, and investment (perhaps) to rise concomitantly. Is there evidence that
either savings or investment actually respond to fertility rate changes as expected? We provide a
tidbit of information in Table 6. From the Penn World Table, we gather information on the
proportion of output spent on investment, as well as the analogue for national savings (defined as
national income minus both private consumption and government spending). We do not develop
models for either the savings or investment rates, and simply regress them separately on fixed
time- and country-specific fixed effects, as well as the fertility rate. That is, we include no
conditioning variables at all. Since we take no account of the source or nature of historical and
anticipated shocks, these should be viewed as indicative findings at most. Still, the coefficients

16

are consistent with the basic life-cycle framework; fertility rate increases are associated with a
fall in savings and an increase in the investment rate. These results are consistent with
Herbertsson and Zoega (1999), Kim and Lee (2005), and most of the literature (discussed in
Section 2 above). Curiously, when we use the World Bank’s measure of the current account
(derived from balance of payments data) the results are weaker.17
Almost all the results of this section are consistent with our fertility finding, and
collectively they add somewhat to our level of confidence. However, many are statistically weak
and we do not wish to overstate their strength. This remains an area for future research.

7. Conclusion
This is a dry, straightforward paper, by design. It does not attempt to make any
contribution in terms of theory, methodology, or data. Any interest in this paper lies in its
estimates.
Real exchange rates are difficult to model empirically; while theories abound, there is
only weak empirical evidence supporting quite plausible theories like purchasing power parity
and the Balassa-Samuelson effect. In this paper, we provide a little good news for researchers in
the area. Consistent with standard life-cycle theory, we find that a country experiencing a
decline in its fertility rate experiences a real depreciation, holding other things constant. This
effect seems plausible and robust. We think of this a good place to pass the torch to others.

Appendix: Sketch of a Theoretical Model
In this brief appendix we provide the outlines of a bare-bones model, drawn from the
literature, to illustrate the linkages between fertility and the real exchange rate.
We follow Higgins and Williamson (1996) in modeling agents as living for three periods
in a world of overlapping generations. The middle-aged are the only productive agents, and
must earn enough for their consumption, their children’s consumption, and to save for their old
age. The size of successive generations is linked since children are borne at an exogenous
fertility rate. The middle-aged workers supply their labor inelastically in return for a wage, and
spend this income consistent with a lifetime budget constraint. Preferences are additively
separable, and while parents care about their children, they have no bequest motive.
Output is produced with a CRS production function which experiences exogenous
technological progress; investment augments the capital stock. A small economy with open
capital markets can borrow or lend at the exogenous foreign interest rate, which ties down the
marginal product of capital and hence capital intensity and the capital stock. The interaction of
savings and investment determines the current account, and the real exchange rate adjusts to
ensure a balance between capital flows and the current account.
Given this machinery, Higgins and Williamson show that savings is then a function of
capital intensity, the fertility rate, and the growth rate of productivity. They show that under
plausible conditions, an increase in fertility lowers the savings rate. In all cases, higher fertility
raises investment. However, even if higher fertility leads to increased savings, it always reduces
the current account and thus appreciates the real exchange rate.

30

Endnotes
1

Indeed, the savings rate need not fall in response to an increase in fertility. If the young save a positive amount,
then the fact that they outnumber the old may actually lead to an increase in the savings rate; Obstfeld and Rogoff
(1996, pp 151-2) provide an example.
2
Bryant (2004) refers to this as an “asymmetric” effect. Note that if all national fertility rates fall by the same
amount this effect would be picked up by the time effect and no exchange rate movement would be predicted.
3
Especially since we find it to be quite significant!
4
The current account may also be endogenous.
5
There are no outliers in the sense of observations that lie more than 150% away from the edges of the interquartile
range.
6
The CPI-based multilateral real exchange rate is available for more than four times as many observations as its
closest competitor (which is based on relative normalized unit labor costs).
7
Other authors have also used five-year averages to smooth out short-run influences and reduce the autoregressive
nature of the data; see e.g., Higgins (1996). We create our quinquennial observations by weighting annual data
appropriately, wherever possible. For instance, in constructing the 1975-1980 observation, we put weights of .5 on
both 1975 and 1980 observations and unity on those for the intervening years. For a number of variables we are

The Levin, Lin and Chu test rejects the common unit root process at more than .0001, while the Im, Pesaran and
Shin test for individual unit root processes also rejects at more than .0001. Parenthetically, the evidence for the
fertility rate is more mixed, but the Levin, Lin and Chu test again rejects the common unit root process at more than
.0001.

The lagged dependent variable is itself insignificant in both economic and statistical terms, but reduces our sample
size considerably.

Of the twelve cross-sectional estimates of β (6 periods, 2 models), seven are significantly positive, and five are
close to zero, three positive and two negative. We have no particular interpretation for the 2000 results.

It is thus a scatter-plot of residuals; the regression line has precisely the same slope as that reported in Table 1, by
the Frisch-Waugh theorem.

The non-parametric relationship is estimated with locally weighted regression, using a band width of .5.

Cantor and Driskill (2000) show that the relationship between fertility and the exchange rate may depend on
whether the country is a net debtor or not. Above and beyond adding net foreign assets as a control, we have tested
for this non-linear relationship in a couple of ways. First, we split the sample by whether the country had positive
NFA or not; in both cases β is estimated to be significantly positive for both the default and augmented models.
Second, we added an interaction between NFA and fertility to the set of controls. This was typically positive and of
marginal significance; β remains strongly positive and significant.

The Barro-Lee data set is available at http://www.cid.harvard.edu/ciddata/ciddata.html. We do not use the 2000
education estimates.

Adding a cubic terms results in little change, and the term is insignificant.
