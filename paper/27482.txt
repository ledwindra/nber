Real-Time Real Economic Activity: Exiting the Great Recession and Entering the Pandemic
Recession

NBER Working Paper No. 27482
July 2020
JEL No. E32
ABSTRACT
We study the real-time signals provided by the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Index of Business
conditions (ADS) for tracking economic activity at high frequency. We start with exit from the
Great Recession, comparing the evolution of real-time vintage beliefs to a "final" late-vintage
chronology. We then consider entry into the Pandemic Recession, again tracking the evolution of
real-time vintage beliefs. ADS swings widely as its underlying economic indicators swing
widely, but the emerging ADS path as of this writing (late June) indicates a return to growth in
May. The trajectory of the nascent recovery, however, is highly uncertain (particularly as
COVID-19 spreads in the South and West) and could be revised or eliminated as new data arrive.

Introduction

Accurate assessment of of current real economic activity (“business conditions”) is key for
successful decision making in business, finance, and policy. It is difficult, however, to track
business conditions in real time, both because no single observed economic indicator is
“business conditions”, and because different indicators are available at different observational frequencies, and with different release delays. Nevertheless there exists the tantalizing
possibility of accurate real-time business conditions assessment (“nowcasting”), and recent
decades have witnessed great interest in nowcasting methods and applications (e.g., BanBura
et al. (2011)).
The workhorse nowcasting approaches involve dynamic factor models, which relate a set
of observed real activity indicators to a single underlying latent real activity factor. Both
“small data” approaches (e.g., based on 5 indicators) and “Big Data” approaches (e.g.,
based on 500 indicators) are available. Small data approaches came first, and they typically
involve maximum likelihood estimation (e.g., Stock and Watson (1989)). Subsequent Big
Data approaches, in contrast, typically involve two-step estimation based on a first-step
extraction of principal components (e.g., Stock and Watson (2002), McCracken and Ng
(2016)).
Both introspection and experience reveal that Big Data nowcasting approaches are not
necessarily better. First, they are more tedious to manage, and less transparent. Second,
they may not deliver much improvement in factor extraction accuracy, which increases and
stabilizes quickly as the number of indicators increases (Doz et al., 2012). Third, casual
inclusion of many indicators can be problematic because a poorly-balanced set of indicators
can create distortions in the extracted factor (Boivin and Ng, 2006), whereas small data
approaches promote and facilitate hard thinking about a well-balanced set of indicators (Bai
and Ng (2008)).
Against this background, in this paper we assess the performance of a leading small-data
nowcast, the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti (ADS) Index of Business Conditions (Aruoba et al.,
2009). ADS is designed to track real business conditions at high frequency, and it has been
maintained and released in real time by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia continuously since 2008.1 Its modeling style and underlying economic indicators build on classic

The production version used by FRB Philadelphia differs in some ways (e.g., included indicators and
treatment of trend) from the prototypes provided by Aruoba et al. (2009) and Aruoba and Diebold (2010),
which themselves differ slightly. All discussion in this paper refers to the FRB Philadelphia version. All

research-and-data/real-time-center/business-conditions-index.

early work in the tradition of Burns and Mitchell (1946), Sargent and Sims (1977), and Stock
and Watson (1989). The underlying indicators span high- and low-frequency information on
real economic flows: weekly initial jobless claims; monthly payroll employment growth, industrial production growth, personal income less transfer payments growth, manufacturing
and trade sales growth; and quarterly real GDP growth.
Crucially, we assess ADS performance using only information actually available in real
time. This is required for truly credible real-time evaluation, and it can only be achieved
by using nowcasts produced and permanently recorded in real time, which is very different
from simply removing final-revised data and inserting vintage data into an otherwise ex
post analysis. Unfortunately, such evaluations are rare, because there simply are not many
instances of long series of nowcasts produced and recorded in real time. ADS, however, has
been produced and recorded in real time roughly twice weekly since late 2008, so we can
provide real-time performance assessments both exiting the Great Recession and entering
the Pandemic Recession.
We proceed as follows. In section 2 we provide background on aspects of ADS construction, updating, ex post characteristics, and performance evaluation. In section 3 we evaluate
ADS performance exiting the Great Recession. In section 4 we evaluate ADS performance
entering the Pandemic Recession. We conclude in section 5.

ADS Construction, Characteristics, and Assessment

Here we provide background on index construction (section 2.1), ex post historical characteristics (section 2.2), and general issues of relevance to assessing ex ante nowcasting
performance (section 2.3).

2.1

Construction and Updating

ADS is a dynamic factor model with multiple indicators and a single latent real activity
factor. The ADS index is an estimate of that latent real activity factor. Importantly,
the model is specified such that the real activity factor tracks the de-meaned growth rate
of real activity. Hence zero ADS does not indicate zero growth; rather, zero ADS indicates
“normal” growth. Progressively more negative or positive values indicate progressively worseor better-than-average real growth, respectively.
ADS is specified at daily frequency, allowing as necessary for missing data for the less-

frequently observed variables.2 Importantly, despite complications from missing data, timevarying system matrices, aggregation across frequencies, etc., the Kalman filter and associated Gaussian pseudo likelihood evaluation via prediction-error decomposition remain valid,
subject to some well-known modifications.3 Model estimation is therefore straightforward,
after which the Kalman smoother produces an optimal extraction of the underlying real
activity factor. That is, the Kalman smoother produces the ADS index: The extracted
sequence at any time t∗ is the vintage-t∗ ADS sequence, {ADS1 , ADS2 , ...ADSt∗ }.
The first ADS vintage was released 12/5/2008, covering 3/1/1960 through 11/30/2008.
Since then, ADS has been continuously updated whenever new data are released. The
Kalman smoother is re-run, generally within two hours of the release, and the newlyextracted index is re-written to the web from 3/1/1960 to “the present”. ADS has been
updated approximately eight times per month on average since inception.

2.2

Ex Post Characteristics

In Figure 1 we show the ADS index from 03/01/1960 through 12/31/2006, as assessed in the
6/26/2020 vintage. The sample range is well before the vintage pull date, so the chronology
displayed is (intentionally) ex post. We do this because it is instructive to examine the ex
post chronology before passing to real time assessment, which can only be done after ADS
went live in late 2008.4
Several features are noteworthy. For example, the ADS chronology coheres strongly with
the NBER chronology, plunging during NBER recessions. In addition, several often-discussed
features of the business-cycle are evident in ADS, such as the pronounced moderation in
volatility during the Greenspan era.
The ADS value added relative to the NBER chronology stems from the facts that (1) it
is a cardinal measure, allowing one to assess not only recession durations, but also depths
and patterns (see Table 1), and (2) its updates arrive in timely fashion, whereas NBER
recession start and end dates are typically not announced until long after the fact (again
see Table 1). Of course, if ADS is to be a useful guide for business and policy decisions, its
frequently-arriving updates must provide reliable signals in real time, not just ex post as in
Figure 1. We now turn to that issue.

2.3

Performance Assessment

Truly credible nowcasting performance assessment requires using vintage information, which
emerges as the limit of a sequence of progressively more realistic and credible nowcast/forecast
evaluation approaches:5
1. Use full-sample estimation, and use final revised data
2. Use expanding-sample estimation, and use final revised data
3. Use expanding-sample estimation, and use vintage data (“Pseudo Real Time”)
2
The model must be specified at daily frequency, despite the fact that the highest-frequency indicator
is is weekly initial jobless claims, to account for the varying number of days/weeks per month, which also
produces time-varying system parameter matrices.
3
See, for example, Durbin and Koopman (2001) on missing data, and Harvey (1991) on aggregation of
flow variables.
4
The sample period intentionally excludes the Pandemic Recession, which we will subsequently examine
in detail.
5
Note that nowcasts are effectively just h-step-ahead forecasts with horizon h=0.

Notes: Recession dates and durations in months are from the NBER chronology; see https://www.nber.
org/cycles.html. When available, the announcement dates appear in parentheses. The NBER trough
month for the Pandemic Recession has not yet been announced. Recession depth is the minimum absolute
daily ADS value during the recession; more precisely, the depth D of recession R is D = |mini (ADSi )|,
i ∈ R, where i denotes days. Recession severity S is the product of depth and duration. Both D and S use
a late-vintage ADS chronology and the NBER recession chronology.

4. Use expanding-sample estimation, and use vintage information (“Real Time”).
Approaches 1 and 2 are clearly unsatisfactory: Approach 1 uses time periods and data values
not available in real time, and approach 2 is an improvement but still uses data not available
in real time. Approach 3, involving vintage data, is typically viewed as the gold standard.
It is implemented comparatively infrequently, however, due to the tedium involved and the
fact that vintage data are often unavailable.6 Approach 4, use of vintage information, limits
the information set to that available and actually used in real time, which is more restrictive
than merely limiting the data to that available in real time. It is, however, almost never
implemented.
To appreciate why fully-credible assessment requires vintage information rather than just
vintage data, consider the following:
1. Econometric/statistical theory and experience evolve, prompting changes to the estimation procedure; the frequency and timing of re-estimation and its interaction with
6

The two key sources of U.S. vintage data are the Real-Time Dataset for Macroeconomists at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/
real-time-center/real-time-data/), and ALFRED at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (https:
//alfred.stlouisfed.org/).

benchmark revisions; the estimation sample period; allowance for parameter variation
and breaks; the treatment of outliers; the strength of regularization employed; the
predictive loss function employed; etc.
2. Economic theory and empirical economic experience evolve. Over time this may
prompt, for example, the removal or re-weighting of some component nowcast indicators and/or addition of others (e.g., Diebold and Rudebusch (1991)), as well as
deeper changes in the nowcasting model.
3. Exact times and reliability of nowcast/forecast calculation and release may differ due
to technological problems; outright mistakes in nowcast/forecast construction; evolving
or changing software algorithms and associated bugs; parallel problems at the agencies
responsible for the underlying data and decisions regarding how to deal with them in
forecast/nowcast construction; etc.
For these and other reasons, just as truly credible evaluation requires refraining from endowing agents with better data than were actually available in real time, so too does it
require refraining from endowing them with better economic or statistical models and related tools than were actually available in real time, better judgment and decision-making
abilities/choices than were actually manifest in real time, etc.
The upshot is clear: Truly credible real-time evaluation – that is, evaluation using vintage
information rather than just vintage data – can only be obtained by using nowcasts produced
and permanently recorded in real time. ADS has been produced and recorded in real time
since late 2008, so as of this writing we can study two key episodes: exit from the Great
Recession and entry into the Pandemic Recession. We now proceed to do so.

3

Exiting the Great Recession

We refer to a real-time ADS extraction as a path, and a graph of a sequence of paths as
a path plot.7 By following the path plot rightward, moving through time, we track the
evolution of ADS beliefs about the chronology of business conditions. We cannot examine
real-time ADS performance when entering the Great Recession, because ADS did not start
until December 2008, well after the great recession began. But we can examine real-time
ADS performance when exiting the great recession.
7

Sometimes we call path plots “tentacle plots”, because the paths resemble the tentacles of a jellyfish.

Figure 2: Exiting the Great Recession: Five Quarterly Real-Time ADS Paths

7
Notes: We show five quarterly real-time ADS paths in black. From top to bottom they
are 12/5/2008, 3/6/2009, 6/5/2009, 9/3/2009, 12/4/2009. For comparison we show a latevintage ADS path (December 2010) in red.

In Figure 2 we show five paths in black, from ADS inception through the end of the
Great Recession, at quarterly intervals. For comparison we also show a late-vintage path
in red. One can think of the late-vintage path as “truth”, or at least a good assessment of
truth based on late-vintage data. It is revealing to compare the real-time paths to the ex
post path.
In the top panel of Figure 2 we show the first ADS path, 12/5/2008. ADS shows a very
deep recession, almost the deepest on record since 1960, bottoming out in 2008Q3, with
movement toward recovery in late Q3 and early Q4, even if it had stalled a bit by early
December. As it turned out, however, the Great Recession subsequently featured a growth
rate “double dip”. The 12/5/2008 ADS path ends just after the first dip, which involved a
sharp drop in September 2008 and an equally sharp rebound.8 At the time it was easy to
read the cards as saying that the recession was ending, and ADS was a bit too optimistic,
moving upward toward recovery.
Now consider the remaining panels of Figure 2. In the second panel we show the next,
and contrasting, 3/6/2008 ADS path. In the interim ADS has quickly learned the situation,
the double dip in particular, and is very much on track, capturing the second dip in January
2009. ADS continues to climb steadily through the third and fourth panels (6/5/2009 and
9/3/3009, respectively), and by the time of the bottom panel (12/4/2009) it is clear that the
Great Recession ended in June or July, with ADS basically fluctuating around 0 after that.
(Recall that ADS=0 means average growth, not zero growth.)
All told, the five quarterly real-time ADS paths generally match the ex post path closely,
and they correctly identify the recession’s end, well before the end of 2009 and indeed roughly
1.5 years before the official NBER announcement in September 2010.
To emphasize ADS timeliness, we plot the late vintage ADS in Figure 2 all the way
through 2010, which allows inclusion of the NBER’s end-of-recession announcement on
9/20/2010, long after the fact and not helpful for real-time decision making.9 ADS fills
the gap left by the late-arriving NBER chronology, and it also provides a numerical measure
that allows one to track the recession’s pattern, depth, overall severity, etc., in addition to
8

In particular, according to the Federal Reserve’s G.17 Industrial Production (IP) release of October
16, 2008, September IP was severely affected by a highly-unusual and largely exogenous “triple shock”
(Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, and a strike at a major aircraft manufacturer), which caused an annualized
September IP drop of nearly fifty percent. A similar pattern exists for Manufacturing and Trade Sales
(MTS). IP and MTS also rebounded unusually sharply in October – indeed IP appears to “overshoot” –
presumably in an attempt by manufacturers to make up for September’s loss.
9
Of course the NBER is not seeking to be helpful for real-time decision making; rather, they seek to
meticulously construct the U.S. business cycle chronology of record, quite reasonably using all relevant
information – even very late-arriving information.

duration. For example and as recorded in Table 1, ADS identifies the Great Recession as
the worst since 1960 and through 2010, with longest duration and second-greatest depth,
resulting in the greatest overall severity (duration times depth).
In Figure 3 we show the complete path plot (the set of all real-time paths). Of course
there are errors positive and negative as the recession evolves, but overall ADS performs well,
sending a reliable and valuable signal for navigating the path out of recession. We show the
corresponding “dot plot” in Figure 4; each dot is the last observation of its corresponding
path in Figure 3. The dots are real-time smoothed values.10 The black-dot sequence of
real-time smooths is naturally less variable than the later-vintage (December 2010) smooth
shown in red, because the latter has more information on which to condition, and therefore
captures more variation.
10

They are also filtered, because smoothed and filtered values coincide for the last observation in a sample.

Entering the Pandemic Recession

We focus in this section on the Pandemic Recession that started in March 2020. It is
instructive to begin by comparing it to the Great Recession of 2007-2009. To that end
we show the ADS path in Figure 5, from late 2007 through the date of this writing. The
so-called “Great Recession” appears minor by comparison.

4.1
4.1.1

A Detailed Look at the Latest Vintage Path
Depth

Figure 5 reveals the jaw-dropping ADS drop in the Pandemic Recession, more than five times
that of any other recession since 1960. The ADS drop is entirely appropriate, due to similarly
jaw-dropping and historically unprecedented movements in its underlying indicators.11
We can interpret ADS depth by calibrating the sum of the worst two quarters of GDP
11

See Appendices A and B for chronologies of data releases and ADS movements, respectively.

10

Figure 5: ADS Index: Ex Post Path 12/1/2007 - 6/26/2020 (Vintage 6/26/2020)

growth in a recession to the worst ADS. Use of two-quarter GDP, and not requiring that
the two quarters be contiguous, is helpful because recession troughs may straddle quarterly
boundaries, and moreover because some recessions may have “double-dips”. In Figure 6 we
show a scatterplot of the sum of worst two quarters of GDP growth vs. worst ADS. The
fitted regression line is
\R = −.33 + .54 ADSR ,
GDP
(1)
where GDPR is the sum of the worst two quarters of GDP growth in recession R, and ADSR
is the worst ADS in recession R. The slope is quite precisely estimated (s.e. = .18), and
\R = .5 ADSR . Figure 5 shows an ADS
R2 =.61. As a quick approximation we can use GDP
minimum of roughly -25, corresponding (via equation (1)) to a two-quarter annualized GDP
growth of roughly -12%, or roughly -6% for each of two quarters.
4.1.2

Duration

As of this writing, the official trough month for the Pandemic Recession has not been announced. It could be as early as May 2020, in which case the Pandemic Recession would be
the shortest in history. (A May trough turns out to be likely, if highly uncertain, conditional
on information available through June, as we will soon discuss.) The trough could of course
also be later, perhaps with additional dips due to continued spread and potential resurgence
of COVID-19.

11

Figure 6: Worst Two GDP Quarters vs. Worst ADS

Notes: We show the sum of the worst two quarters of GDP vs. the worst ADS value, for
each recession except the Pandemic Recession (both the GDP drop and the ADS drop are
as-yet unknown for the Pandemic Recession), together with the fitted regression line.
4.1.3

General Pattern

In Figure 7 we show the latest-vintage Pandemic Recession path. The overall extracted
path is smooth and convex, with a minimum in early April, and a return to average growth
by mid-May. We emphasize again, however, that ADS measures real activity growth, not
level. Hence positive ADS does not necessarily mean “good times”; rather, it means “good
growth”, which may be from a very bad initial condition. That was evidently the situation
in late May, as the battered U.S. economy evidently resumed growth.

4.2.1

Real-Time Vintages
Five Snapshots

In Figure 8 we show several end-of-month paths in black, starting with February 2020. For
comparison, in each panel we also show the latest-vintage path in red. One should not think
of the later-vintage path as “truth”, because it may be revised as new data arrive. Ideally we
would like to use a vintage from a year or two after the recession’s end, as with our use of the
12

Figure 7: ADS Index: Ex Post Path 1/1/2020 - 6/26/2020 (Vintage 6/26/2020)

December 2010 vintage as a reference path when assessing ADS during the Great Recession
in section 4, but we do not have that luxury at present. Meanwhile it is still informative to
compare the last-available path to earlier paths. Moving through the five panels of Figure 8:
1. In the top panel we show the 2/28/2020 path. ADS has not moved.
2. In the second panel we show the 3/27/2020 path, which looks very different. ADS has
become acutely aware of the disastrous situation; indeed most of the 3/27 path is well
below the previous all-time (post-1960) ADS low during the 1970s oil-shock recession.12
3. In the third panel we show the 4/30/2020 path. The April initial claims news is bad,
but less bad than March, which is good, and ADS shows a minimum in late March
followed by a rise toward normalcy by the end of April.
4. In the fourth panel we show the 5/29/2020 path. The May news is very bad, dominated
by the shockingly bad May 8 payroll employment number (for April), and the late-May
path is massively down-shifted relative to the late-April path. The new minimum is
in mid-April rather than late March, and the 5/29 ADS value is thoroughly dismal,
nowhere near normalcy.
5. In the fifth panel we show the 6/26/2020 path. Thanks to the strong May payroll
employment number (released June 5), ADS moved into normal territory, and stayed
12

It is also apparent that the Kalman smoother may be smoothing “too much”, producing low ADS values
well before mid-March, going back into February and even January. Its smoothing is optimal relative to the
patterns in historical data, but the March initial jobless claims movements were unprecedentedly sharp.

13

Figure 8: Entering the Pandemic Recession: Monthly Real-Time ADS Paths

2/28/2020, 3/27/2020, 4/30/2020, 5/29/2020, and 6/26/2020. For comparison we show the
6/26/2020 path in red in all panels. (In the bottom panel, we show only black, since black
and red are identical.)

there. There is clear (albeit highly-tentative evidence for a Pandemic Recession trough
in mid-May, when ADS hits 0.)
4.2.2

The Full Path Plot

In Figure 9 we show the complete path plot during the Pandemic Recession through 6/26/2020,
with the final path in red for comparison. In Appendix B we provide a corresponding annotated path chronology.
There are wide real-time divergences between individual early paths and the latestvintage red path. There are interesting patterns, however, with several real-time “meta
paths” evident:
1. The first extends through the 3/19/2020 ADS announcement. ADS does not move.
Initial claims rise from 0.2m to 0.3m, a large move by historical standards, confirming what everyone already knew: the pandemic would have important real economic

consequences, but the Kalman smoother optimally but erroneously ascribes it to measurement error.
2. The second meta-path begins with the 3/26/2020 and 4/2/2020 initial claims explosions. ADS plunges, but then recovers steadily despite a steady stream of bad news
(it is bad, but getting less bad), almost back to 0 by the 5/7/2020 initial claims announcement.
3. The third meta-path begins with the horrific 5/8/2020 April payroll employment release, with ADS again plunging. It then again begins mean reverting, and does so
completely when the strong May payroll employment number is released on 6/5/2020.
In Figure 10 we show the corresponding dot plot, with the 6/26/2020 path again superimposed. The dot plot is highly volatile and emphasizes the various meta-paths.

Concluding Remarks

Our approach was part methodological and part substantive. On the methodological side,
we clarified the meaning of truly honest real-time nowcast/forecast evaluation and illustrated
it using the ADS Business Conditions Index, which has now been in operation over a long
span that includes emergence from the Great Recession and entry into the Pandemic Recession. On the substantive side, we explored how views formed using best-practice nowcasts
evolved when exiting the Great Recession, which is now a settled historical episode, and
when entering the Pandemic Recession, which continues to swirl around us.
We started with exit from the Great Recession, comparing the evolution of real-time vintage beliefs to a “final” late-vintage chronology. We then moved to entry into the Pandemic
Recession, which arrived abruptly and was caused by non-economic factors, again tracking
the evolution of real-time vintage beliefs. During March-June 2020, ADS swung widely as
its underlying components swung widely, but as of the date of this writing (late June 2020)
ADS indicates a very deep but also very short recession, with a business cycle trough in May
2020. The trajectory of the nascent recovery, however, is highly uncertain – particularly as
COVID-19 spreads in the South and West – and could be revised or eliminated as new data
arrive.
Models generally cannot be expected to perform well in out-of-sample environments
wildly different from the training environment. This is all the more so for linear models like ADS, which in reality are just locally-linear approximations. From this vantage
point the credible out-of-sample performance of ADS is rather remarkable. Nevertheless,
nonlinear/non-Gaussian ADS extensions could perhaps be usefully entertained, for example
using the framework of Gunsilius and Schennach (2019).

Pandemic Recession Entry: Annotated Chronology

March 17 (February industrial production). The day of the last ADS update before the
March 19 initial claims release. ADS continued its more-or-less random vibration around
zero, sending the same signal that it had sent since the end of the Great Recession in 2009:
the economy is growing normally. ADS=0.1.
March 19 (initial jobless claims). IJC took a large move upward, confirming what everyone
already knew: the pandemic would have important real economic consequences. The Kalman
smoother optimally but erroneously ascribed this first-time IJC jump almost entirely to
measurement error, and ADS basically did not move. ADS=-0.2.
March 26 (initial jobless claims). IJC spiked in jaw-dropping off-the-chart fashion. Two
huge IJC moves in a row are not optimally ascribed to measurement error by the Kalman
smoother; rather, they are naturally ascribed to the underlying serially-correlated real activity factor – and ADS drops to approximately -15 in similarly (and literally) off-the-chart
fashion. By way of comparison, the all-time ADS lows since 1960 were in the recessions of
1973-1975 and 2007-2009, in both cases between -4 and -5. Note that the ADS path now
begins its drop earlier in the year, a result of the serial correlation in IJC interacting with
the Kalman smoother. It is interesting to speculate as to whether real activity really was
lower in February (say), due for example to the virus-induced January-February collapse of
a major trading partner (China). ADS=-14.5.
March 26 (GDP Q4 release 3). Irrelevant. ADS=-14.5.
March 27 (February personal income, January real manufacturing and trade sales). Irrelevant. ADS=-14.3.
April 2 (Initial jobless claims). IJC doubles off-the-charts, and ADS similarly doubles (downward) to -31. The Kalman smoother now has ADS beginning its decline in early January,
again presumably an artifact of the serial correlation in IJC interacting with the Kalman
smoother. Or, again, perhaps it’s real. ADS=-31.0.
19

April 3 (March payroll employment). PE drops but ADS rises. ADS evidently views the
PE drop as good news, because it’s not such a big drop compared to the off-the-charts
ADS=-21.2.
April 9 (Initial jobless claims). Another massive IJC increase, but ADS largely unchanged.
ADS=-20.6.
April 15 (March industrial production). IP plunges, but it’s for the last month, and ADS
actually continues its gradual upward mean reversion as initial claims improve. ADS=-17.1.
April 16 (Initial jobless claims). IJC drops some, and ADS improves. ADS=-11.1.
April 23 (Initial jobless claims). IJC and ADS again improve. ADS=-7.2.
April 29 (Q3 GDP, first release). -4.8 % annualized. 2008Q4 was worse (-7.5 %) but the
2020Q1 number was driven only by (part of) March. Had January, February, and early
March 2020 been as bad as late March, 2020Q1 GDP growth would have been much worse.
ADS is essentially unchanged. In the absence of the GDP news, ADS would presumably
have risen, but the bad GDP news provided an offset. ADS=-6.9.
April 30 (Initial jobless claims; March real personal income less transfer payments; February
real manufacturing and trade sales). February RMTS is irrelevant. IJC continues slowly
improving. PILTP for the previous month down sharply. The news is all bad, yet not so bad
as it was, and ADS improves, now it approximately equals its worst value during the Great
Recession. ADS=-3.9.
May 7 (Initial jobless claims). IJC again improving. The IJC numbers continue to be
bad, but they are getting less bad, and ADS seems driven by that. By this time the path
plot makes clear that new data are causing sizable revisions in entire paths. For example,
the huge ADS trough was estimated to be approximately -32 in the 4/2 vintage, but it
was progressively moved upward in subsequent vintages, and now in the 5/7 vintage it is
approximately -12. ADS=-0.6.
May 8 (Payroll employment). Plunges downward, and ADS plunges similarly to an all-time
low. ADS=-36.2.
May 14 (Initial jobless claims) IJC almost unchanged; ADS improves slightly to ADS=-32.6.

20

May 15 (April industrial production). Plunges but ADS nevertheless ADS improves. ADS=26.9.
May 21 (Initial jobless claims) IJC improves, and ADS improves to ADS=-22.9.
May 28 (Initial jobless claims; GDP Q1 second release) IJC improves slightly, Q1 GDP
revised down slightly. ADS improves to ADS=-19.7.
May 29 (Real manufacturing and trade sales, March; Real personal income less transfer
payments, April) Both down sharply. ADS=-19.5.
June 4 (Initial jobless claims) IJC continues its ever-so-slow reversion to normalcy. ADS=16.8.
June 5 (May payroll employment). PE increases sharply. Finally some surprising good news.
ADS improves and goes positive. ADS=2.6.
June 11 (Initial jobless claims). IJC improves slightly. ADS=3.6.
June 16 (May Industrial production). IP up, ADS unchanged. ADS=3.6.
June 18 (Initial jobless claims). IJC basically unchanged. ADS=3.1.
June 25 (Initial jobless claims). IJC basically unchanged. ADS=2.8.
June 16 (Real manufacturing and Trade Sales). MTS *****. ADS=*****.
