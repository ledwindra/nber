    "abstract": "\n\nThe value of pension promises already made by US state governments will grow to approximately $7.9 trillion in 15 years.  We study investment strategies of state pension plans and estimate the distribution of future funding outcomes.  We conservatively predict a 50% chance of aggregate underfunding greater than $750 billion and a 25% chance of at least $1.75 trillion (in 2005 dollars).  Adjusting for risk, the true intergenerational transfer is substantially larger.  Insuring both taxpayers against funding deficits and plan participants against benefit reductions would cost almost $2 trillion today, even though governments portray state pensions as almost fully funded.\n\n",
