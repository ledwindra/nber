ABSTRACT
This paper examines the detrimental consequences of financial market imperfections for international
trade. I develop a heterogeneous-firm model with countries at different levels of financial development
and sectors of varying financial vulnerability. Applying this model to aggregate trade data, I study
the mechanisms through which credit constraints operate. First, financial development increases countries'
exports above and beyond its impact on overall production. Firm selection into exporting accounts
for a third of the trade-specific effect, while two thirds are due to reductions in firm-level exports.
Second, financially advanced economies export a wider range of products and their exports experience
less product turnover. Finally, while all countries service large destinations, exporters with superior
financial institutions have more trading partners and also enter smaller markets. All of these effects
are magnified in financially vulnerable sectors. These results have important policy implications for
less developed economies that rely on exports for economic growth but suffer from poor financial
contractibility.

Introduction

A growing body of work has argued that, in the presence of credit constraints, …nancially advanced economies have a comparative advantage in …nancially vulnerable industries. These
studies have emphasized the variation in export values across countries and sectors, but ignored
the e¤ects of …nancial frictions on di¤erent trade margins and on overall production. On the
other hand, a large literature has highlighted the importance of reallocations across …rms and
across products and trade partners within …rms for aggregate trade and the adjustment to trade
reforms. While …rm heterogeneity has been successfully used to rationalize aggregate export outcomes, its consequences in the presence of imperfect …nancial markets have not been explored.
This paper provides an overall treatment of the e¤ect of …nancial frictions on international
trade in order to elucidate the mechanisms through which it operates. I develop a heterogeneous…rm model with countries at di¤erent levels of …nancial development and sectors of varying
…nancial vulnerability. Using model-consistent estimation, I show empirically that credit constraints severely impede …rm selection into exporting and restrict …rms’sales abroad. Financial
development thus allows countries to expand aggregate exports, broaden their export product
scope, enter more foreign markets, and reduce product churning. These e¤ects are magni…ed
in …nancially vulnerable industries. Importantly, the impact of credit constraints on trade goes
above and beyond that on overall production. These results have signi…cant policy implications
for less developed economies, many of which rely heavily on exports for economic growth but
su¤er from ine¢ cient …nancial markets.
In the model, credit constraints a¤ect manufacturers in di¤erent countries and sectors unevenly. First, for technological reasons, producers in certain industries require more external
…nance to fund their export activities. Sectors also di¤er in …rms’endowments of tangible assets
that can serve as collateral. Second, …nancial frictions vary across countries because contracts
between entrepreneurs and investors are more likely to be enforced at higher levels of …nancial development. Exporters in …nancially vulnerable sectors are thus less credit constrained in
economies with stronger …nancial contractibility.
Credit constraints also interact non-trivially with …rm heterogeneity and reinforce the selection of only the most productive …rms into exporting: Because more e¢ cient suppliers earn
higher revenues, they can o¤er …nanciers greater returns and are more likely to secure the external capital necessary to sell abroad. As a result, the productivity cut-o¤ for exporting as well as
…rm-level exports vary systematically across exporting countries and sectors. These movements
in turn in‡uence a number of other trade features.
I …nd strong support for the model’s predictions in a panel of bilateral exports for 107 countries and 27 ISIC 3-digit sectors in 1985-1995. I study how interactions of country measures
of …nancial development (private credit, contract repudiation, accounting standards, risk of expropriation) and sector indicators of …nancial vulnerability (external …nance dependence, asset
tangibility) predict di¤erent export outcomes. Exploiting the variation across both countries and
1

sectors allows me to establish a causal e¤ect of credit constraints on trade. To guard against
omitted variable bias, I condition on other determinants of comparative advantage such as factor
endowments, overall development (GDP per capita), and the broader institutional environment
(general rule of law, corruption).
I …rst show that …nancial frictions hinder international trade ‡ows through three channels: the
selection of …rms into domestic production, the selection of active manufacturers into exporting,
and …rm-level exports. As a result, …nancially developed countries are more likely to enter any
given market and export more conditional on trading. These e¤ects are signi…cantly stronger
in sectors with greater requirements for outside …nance or with fewer collateralizable assets. By
explicitly controlling for domestic output, I establish that only 20%-25% of the total e¤ect of
credit constraints on export volumes re‡ects distortions to overall production. I then decompose
the remaining 75%-80% into disruptions to the extensive and intensive margins of trade. In the
absence of systematic cross-country data at the …rm level, I do so by combining information on
zero and positive bilateral exports in a two-stage structural estimation in the spirit of Helpman,
Melitz and Rubinstein (2008). I conclude that a third of the trade-speci…c e¤ect is attributable
to …rm selection into exporting, while two-thirds are due to reductions in …rm-level exports.
I next document that credit constraints impede product variety and increase product churning
in trade. I study the number of products exported by sector at the …nest level of disaggregation
available: 4-digit SITC goods in the full matrix of bilateral trade ‡ows and 10-digit HS goods
for exports speci…cally to the US. Financially advanced economies export a wider range of products and discontinue fewer export goods over time. These patterns are magni…ed in …nancially
vulnerable sectors and corroborate the results above for the extensive margin of trade.
Finally, I establish that credit constraints force …rms to add export destinations in decreasing
order of market size until they exhaust their …nancial resources. This occurs because larger
markets guarantee higher revenues, which make it easier for exporters to cover the associated
…xed trade costs. Thus, while all countries service the largest markets in the world, …nancially
advanced economies go further down the pecking order, enter smaller destinations as well, and
as a result have more trade partners. Once again this advantage is particularly strong for sectors
intensive in external capital or intangible assets.
My results imply that …nancial frictions have sizeable real e¤ects on international ‡ows,
and are as important for understanding trade patterns as traditional Heckscher-Ohlin sources of
comparative advantage. For example, the impact of a one-standard-deviation improvement in
…nancial development is of the same economic magnitude as that of a similar rise in the human
capital endowment, and substantially larger than that of a commensurate increase in the stock
of physical capital. My estimates also suggest that the strengthening of …nancial institutions
alone explains 22% of the observed growth in trade activity between 1985 and 1995, while factor
accumulation accounts for only 12%.
This paper contributes to a quickly expanding literature on …nancial institutions and trade.

The main theoretical contribution is a parsimonious model of exporters’credit constraints that
provides a transparent link to the data. First, it generates classic comparative-advantage predictions. Second, it incorporates …rm heterogeneity and can thus analyze the impact of …nancial frictions on di¤erent trade margins. Prior models have featured either dimension but not
both. For example, a number of studies have proposed that …nancial development becomes a
source of comparative advantage in the presence of credit constraints (Kletzer and Bardhan 1987;
Beck 2002; Matsuyama 2005; Ju and Wei 2005; Becker and Greenberg 2007). The Ricardian,
representative-…rm nature of these frameworks, however, delivers the counterfactual prediction
that either all or no producers in a given sector export. While Chaney (2005) examines heterogeneous …rms, he does not explicitly model …nancial contracts or sector di¤erences. He also does
not address product churning nor the number and size of export destinations.
The paper also makes three empirical contributions to the literature. First, it isolates the
e¤ect of credit constraints on international trade above and beyond that on overall output. Prior
studies have consistently found that …nancially advanced economies export relatively more in
…nancially vulnerable sectors (Beck 2002, 2003; Becker and Greenberg 2007; Svaleryd and Vlachos
2005; Hur et al. 2006). They do not ask, however, whether this re‡ects the fact that …nancially
developed countries produce more and grow faster in such industries (Rajan and Zingales 1998;
Braun 2003; Fisman and Love 2007). I document that exports are a¤ected disproportionately
more than general economic activity, consistent with trade ‡ows’ higher sensitivity during the
recent …nancial crisis (Chor and Manova 2010).
The second empirical contribution is in decomposing the trade-speci…c e¤ects of credit market
imperfections into distortions to the extensive and intensive margins of trade. While earlier work
examines only positive aggregate ‡ows, I show that …nancial frictions impede …rm-level exports,
as well as …rm entry into foreign markets, export product scope and trade partner intensity.1
This indicates that producers face binding constraints in the …nancing of both …xed and variable
trade costs. My …ndings for product churning are also novel and suggest that …nancial frictions
in‡uence trade dynamics in the presence of shocks to export pro…tability. Together, these results
imply that …nancial underdevelopment could play an important role in the adjustment to trade
reforms, exchange rate movements and other cost or demand shocks.
Third, this paper is the …rst to show empirically that countries observe a pecking order of
export destinations, and that credit constraints modify it importantly. While the heterogeneous…rm model without …nancial frictions (Melitz 2003) also predicts such a pecking order, it has
never been tested in the full matrix of bilateral exports. Eaton et al. (2004, 2008) are the
only studies to o¤er …rm-level evidence that larger and more productive French …rms export to
more markets and to smaller economies. I generalize this result to sector-level trade in the full
cross-section of country pairs, and illustrate how liquidity needs intensify the pecking order.
More broadly, the paper adds to recent work on the e¤ects of …nancial frictions on aggregate
1
Subsequent work by Greenaway et al. (2007), Muûls (2008), Amiti and Weinstein (2009), Manova et al. (2009)
and Minetti and Zhu (2010) …nds consistent evidence using …rm data for UK, Belgium, Japan, China and Italy.

growth, volatility and multinational …rm activity (Aghion et al. 2010; Antràs et al. 2009; Chor et
al. 2006). Prior evidence suggests that foreign direct and portfolio investments provide an alternative source of external …nancing and can partly o¤set the disruptive e¤ects of underdeveloped
local …nancial markets on export ‡ows (Manova 2008; Manova et al. 2009).
This paper also extends a line of research examining the impact of various contractual imperfections on international trade (Nunn 2007; Claessens and Laeven 2003; Levchenko 2007).
Whereas these studies focus on aggregate exports, I also explore the implications of the institutional environment for a range of other trade outcomes. My empirical analysis ensures that the
e¤ects of …nancial development do not capture the role of other institutions.
Finally, my results expand the analysis of the extensive and intensive margins of trade (Hummels and Klenow 2004; Schott 2004; Broda and Weinstein 2006; Baldwin and Harrigan 2007)
and the frequent product and …rm turnover in exporting (Bernard et al. 2010; Bernard and
Jensen 2004; Allessandria and Choi 2007; and Besedes and Prusa 2006, 2007).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes why and how exporters
use external …nance, while Section 3 provides an overview of export patterns in the data. Section
4 develops the model, Section 5 introduces the estimation approach, Section 6 discusses the data,
and Section 7 presents the empirical results. The last section concludes.

Why and how exporters use external …nance

Domestic producers and exporters routinely rely on external capital because they have to incur
substantial upfront costs that cannot be …nanced out of retained earnings or internal cash ‡ows
from operations. These outlays are mostly …xed, such as expenditures on R&D and product
development, marketing research, advertising, and investment in …xed capital equipment. Some
variable expenses such as intermediate input purchases, advance payments to salaried workers,
and land or equipment rental fees are also often sustained before production and sales take place.
Exporting is associated with additional upfront expenditures that make production for foreign
markets even more dependent on external …nancing than manufacturing for the home country.
Sunk and …xed costs of international trade include learning about the pro…tability of potential export markets; making market-speci…c investments in capacity, product customization and
regulatory compliance; and setting up and maintaining foreign distribution networks. Variable
trade costs comprise shipping, duties and freight insurance. As with domestic operations, most
of these expenses have to be incurred before export revenues are realized. Moreover, cross-border
shipping and delivery usually take 60 days longer to complete than domestic orders. This further
aggravates exporters’working capital requirements relative to those of domestic producers.
To meet these liquidity needs, exporters typically access trade …nance from banks and other
…nancial institutions or trade credit from their business partners. These …nancial arrangements
are backed by collateral in the form of tangible assets and potentially inventories. Exporters also
normally purchase insurance contracts in response to the increased risk of cross-border activities
4

compared to domestic sales. For these reasons, a very active market operates for the …nancing
and insurance of international transactions, reportedly worth $10-$12 trillion in 2008. Up to 90%
of world trade has been estimated to rely on some form of trade …nance (Auboin 2009).
The presence of well-developed …nancial markets and strong banking institutions in the exporter’s country are quite important for …rms’ ability to …nance their international activities.
This is both because it is usually easier for …rms to establish banking relationships at home than
in a foreign country, as well as because the exporter’s bank plays a crucial role in cross-border
transactions regardless of the speci…c type of trade …nancing arrangement.2
These considerations motivate the way in which I model the e¤ects of credit constraints on
…rm exports. In particular, I assume that exporters require external …nance for a certain fraction
of their …xed and variable costs of manufacturing and shipping, which they can raise by pledging
collateral. I also focus on the role of …nancial development in the exporting country.3

A …rst glance at the data

There is systematic variation in export patterns across countries at di¤erent levels of …nancial
development and across sectors at di¤erent levels of …nancial vulnerability. This section summarizes these patterns so as to motivate the theoretical model and empirical analysis to follow. For
clarity, I focus on a single cross-section of data for 1995.
Table 1 describes the export activity of 161 countries in 27 manufacturing sectors in the ISIC
3-digit industry classi…cation. Most countries export to at least one destination in each industry,
and only 15% of the exporter-sector cells report no trade. However, the number of trade partners
varies widely across exporting countries and sectors. On average, a country enters 36 markets
in a given industry, with a standard deviation of 42 across countries and sectors. This variation
explains why zeroes dominate the matrix of bilateral exports even at this highly aggregated
sector level: 75% of all exporter-importer-sector triplets are zeros. Moreover, there are many
asymmetric cases in which trade ‡ows in only one direction between a pair of countries.
Export volumes and poduct variety also di¤er greatly across countries and sectors with positive cross-border sales. Bilateral trade data are available for each SITC 4-digit product group,
which I match to ISIC 3-digit sectors. Within a sector, an average exporter sells 5.34 product
groups to a destination market, with a standard deviation of 6.61. Flows are observed at a
…ner level of disaggregation for exports speci…cally to the US. On average, countries ship 64 HS
10-digit products to the US within each industry, with a standard deviation of 148.
The product mix of countries’exports changes frequently over time. More than a quarter of
all 4-digit product groups sold bilaterally are discontinued each year and replaced by new ones.
2

See Trade Finance Guide published by the International Trade Administration for more institutional details.
While access to …nance in the importing country might also matter, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest
that it is an order of magnitude less important. When I include both the importer’s and the exporter’s level of
…nancial development in the regressions below, the estimated coe¢ cients on the latter are roughly 2-3 times bigger
than those on the former. The two also appear to be complements instead of substitutes.
3

5

At the 10-digit level, each year countries replace more than half of their products bound for the
US. However, products’survival rate varies signi…cantly across sectors and exporting countries.
Understanding the drivers of product churning is important because it a¤ects 16% of global trade
by value and up to 34% of US imports.
The variation across countries and sectors is not random. Financially developed economies
systematically outperform exporters with less evolved …nancial institutions. As Figure 1 shows,
countries with higher levels of credit extended to the private sector (as a share of GDP) record
greater bilateral exports for the average sector and destination (correlation coe¢ cient 066).
Such countries also ship a wider range of products (corr coe¤ 071) to more destinations (corr
coe¤ 074). Indeed, Figure 1 would look very similarly if it instead plotted exporters’number of
foreign markets or number of bilaterally traded products against …nancial development. Finally,
…nancially advanced countries experience less product churning over time. The simple correlation
between the exporter’s private credit and the percentage share of bilateral trade by value that
is reallocated across SITC 4-digit products each year is ¬038.

While these patterns suggest that export outcomes vary systematically with the exporter’s

…nancial development, they ignore the variation across sectors. Compare then two countries,
Italy and Argentina, which are at the 70th and 40th percentile by private credit respectively.
In Figure 2, I order sectors by external …nance dependence and plot the value of Italy’s and
Argentina’s average bilateral exports by sector. Italy, the …nancially advanced nation, sells
more than Argentina in almost all sectors, but this advantage is more pronounced in …nancially
vulnerable industries. Similar relationships hold for these two countries’number of destinations,
export product variety, and product stability over time (…gures available on request).
These graphs and summary statistics do not account for di¤erences across countries and sectors unrelated to …nancial frictions. However, as the regression results in Section 7 show, the same
patterns obtain in a large panel after controlling for factor endowments, overall development,
and other institutions. I next present a model that rationalizes these patterns.

A model of credit constraints in trade

This section incorporates credit constraints and …rm heterogeneity in a static, partial equilibrium
model à la Melitz (2003). In order to provide a transparent link between theory and empirics,
the model is kept as simple as possible. Its main predictions are, however, robust to alternative
modeling choices as discussed below.

4.1

Set up

Consider a world with  countries and  sectors. A continuum of …rms produce di¤erentiated
goods in each country and sector, and consumers exhibit love of variety. The utility function for

Domestic producers

Firms incur a sunk cost   to enter an industry before drawing a productivity level 1
from a cumulative distribution function  () with support [   ],     0. The cost
of manufacturing 1 unit of output is  , where  represents the cost of a cost-minimizing
bundle of inputs speci…c to each country and sector. Since  captures di¤erences in aggregate
productivity, factor prices and factor intensities across countries and sectors,4  () does not
depend on  and .
There is overwhelming evidence that credit constraints distort …rms’investment and production decisions, and that this impact varies across sectors.5 To focus on the e¤ect on exports above
and beyond that on domestic production, I assume that …rms …nance their domestic activities
with cash ‡ows from operations. I also assume that there are no …xed costs to servicing the
home market, which implies that all …rms that enter the industry produce domestically. The
consequences of …nancial frictions for trade would not change qualitatively if these assumptions
are relaxed.6 Importantly, the empirical analysis explicitly accounts for the fact that credit
constraints might a¤ect …rms’selection into domestic production.

4.3

Credit-constrained exporters

Firms in country  can export to  by paying a …xed cost   each period, where   0 for
 6=  and  = 0. Exporters also incur iceberg trade costs so that



 1 units of a product

need to be shipped for 1 unit to arrive.
4

See Bernard et al. (2007) for a multi-sector, multi-factor extension of Melitz (2003).
For example, Rajan and Zingales (1998), Fisman and Love (2007), and Braun (2003) show that sectors intensive
in outside …nance and sectors with few collateralizable assets grow faster in …nancially developed countries.
6
When …rms require external …nance to produce for both the home and foreign market, two productivity cuto¤s govern …rms’behavior: a lower cut-o¤ for domestic production and a higher one for exporting. Both cut-o¤s
are systematically lower in …nancially developed countries, and even more so in …nancially vulnerable sectors. In
other words, …nancially advanced economies export more (especially in some sectors) because (i) they have fewer
domestic producers, (ii) fewer producers become exporters, and (iii) those who do so export less.
5

7

Firms face credit constraints in the …nancing of production and transportation expenditures
related to international trade. I …rst assume that exporters can …nance variable costs internally,
but need to raise outside capital for a fraction  , 0    1, of the …xed trade cost. Producers
in country  and sector  therefore have to borrow    to service country . In Section 4.5,
I relax this assumption and posit that all costs are subject to liquidity constraints.
The underlying assumption is that …rms cannot use pro…ts from past periods to …nance future
operations. This assumption can be justi…ed if, for example, …rms cannot retain earnings but
have to distribute all pro…ts to shareholders at the end of each period.7 Alternatively,  is the
fraction of outlays that needs to be …nanced externally after all retained earnings have been used
up. This is akin to …rms experiencing liquidity shocks because of up-front costs which they can
cover only after revenues are realized but not in advance. The relative importance of up-front
costs varies across sectors for technological reasons speci…c to the nature of each industry, as
argued by Rajan and Zingales (1998). The parameter  captures precisely this variation and
corresponds to the measure of external …nance dependence that I use in the empirical analysis.
In obtaining outside …nance, …rms pledge tangible assets as collateral. I assume that a fraction
 , 0    1, of the sunk cost …rms pay to enter an industry goes towards collateralizable
assets such as plant, property and equipment.89 This fraction corresponds to the measure of
asset tangibility in my empirical analysis, and is also assumed to be an inherent feature of each
industry, as proposed by Braun (2003) and others.
Finally, countries vary in their level of …nancial contractibility. An investor can expect to be
repayed with probability

,

0



 1, which is exogenous to the model and determined by the

strength of country ’s …nancial institutions.10 With probability (1 ¬

)

the …nancial contract

is not enforced, the …rm defaults, and the creditor seizes the collateral    . To continue
operations and be able to borrow in the future, the …rm then needs to replace this collateral.
Financial contracting proceeds as follows. In the beginning of each period, every …rm makes
a take-it-or-leave-it o¤er to a potential investor. This contract speci…es the amount the …rm
needs to borrow, the repayment  in case the contract is enforced, and the collateral in case of
default. Revenues are then realized and the investor receives payments at the end of the period.
7
This might arise, for example, in the presence of principal-agent problems. In a dynamic model with endogenous default, if …rms used retained earnings or …nanciers rewarded …rms with better credit history, the e¤ect of
credit constraints on the selection of only the most productive …rms into exporting would be reinforced since they
have the highest pro…ts and are thus most likely to retain earnings and to not default.
8
The model’s qualitative results would not change if the …xed costs of exporting were collateralizable instead.
Because the latter are usually related to marketing and distribution networks, it is more realistic to assume that
the sunk cost of entry into the industry represents in part tangible assets.
9
Firms might invest in tangible assets to increase their capacity for raising outside …nance. This will be costly
if such investments require outside capital and …rms’asset structure deviates from the …rst-best.
10
The assumption that the default rate is exogenous is made for simplicity. Firms would presumably have less
incentives to default in countries with superior …nancial contractibility where dafault is costlier. Firms would also
be more likely to become insolvent and default in response to exogenous shocks if they are less productive, need
more external …nance, or have less collateral. The di¤erential e¤ects of credit constraints across countries, sectors
and …rms in the model would therefore continue to hold under endogenous default.

The expression for pro…ts above re‡ects the fact that the …rm …nances all its variable costs
and a fraction (1 ¬  ) of its …xed costs internally, pays the investor  () when the …nancial
contract is enforced (with probability

)

and replaces the collateral claimed by the creditor in

case of default (with probability (1 ¬

In the absence of credit constraints, exporters maximize pro…ts subject to the demand condi-

tion given by the …rst constraint above. With external …nancing, two additional conditions bind
…rms’decisions. When the …nancial contract is enforced, entrepreneurs can o¤er at most their
net revenues  () to the creditor. In addition, investors only fund the …rm if their net return
 () exceeds their outside option, which has been normalized to 0.11
With competitive credit markets, all investors break even and make zero expected pro…ts.
Firms therefore adjust their payment  () so as to bring the …nancier to his participation
constraint. Since  () = 0 in equilibrium, the maximization problem reduces to the …rm’s
problem in the absence of …nancial frictions except for the liquidity constraint that  () be no
greater than the …rm’s net revenues. Hence, exporting …rms optimally choose the same export
quantities and prices, and earn the same export revenues and pro…ts as in Melitz (2003):

Entry into exporting

Since revenues increase with e¢ ciency and trade entails …xed costs, all …rms with productivity
above a certain cut-o¤ level can pro…tably export. With perfect …nancial contractibility (



= 1),

the model would reduce to the original Melitz (2003) formulation, and this threshold 1 would
be pinned down by   =   . Financial frictions, however, preclude some …rms from
becoming exporters and raise the productivity cut-o¤ to 1 , given by the condition

Figure 3A plots export pro…ts as an increasing function of productivity and illustrates the
wedge between the productivity thresholds for exporting with and without credit constraints.
While potential export pro…ts are nonzero for all …rms with e¢ ciency above 1 , only those
more productive than 1 successfully obtain outside …nance and sell abroad. This e¤ect
arises because all …rms in a given sector have the same …nancing needs and collateralizable
assets, but more productive …rms earn higher revenues and can o¤er investors greater returns in
case of repayment. Some low-productivity …rms could thus pro…tably export in the absence of
…nancial frictions, but their sales are too low to incentivize a …nancier: Even if they o¤ered all
net revenues, he would not break even. In line with a large literature in corporate …nance, the
model thus predicts that larger, more productive …rms are less likely to be credit constrained.12
Of note, 1  1 requires that      . Intuitively, credit constraints bind and
a¤ect export participation whenever …rms need to borrow more than what they can pledge as
collateral. In view of my …ndings, I assume that this condition holds in the rest of the analysis.
The extent to which …nancial frictions distort …rm selection into exporting depends on the
strength of countries’ …nancial contractibility and the level of sectors’ …nancial vulnerability.
These comparative statics are summarized in the following proposition:
Proposition 1 (Cut-o¤ ) Under credit constraints, the productivity cut-o¤ for exporting is lower
in …nancially developed countries (

(1 )
 

 0). Within each country, this cut-o¤ is higher

in sectors with a greater need for external …nance and in sectors with fewer tangible assets
(

(1 )


 0,

(1 )


 0). The e¤ ect of …nancial development is more pronounced in …nan-

cially vulnerable sectors (

 2 (1 )
  

 0,

 2 (1 )
  

 0).

Intuitively, how likely a …rm is to be credit constrained depends on its industry. For any
productivity level, investors are more willing to fund …rms in sectors that require less outside
capital ( lower) or have more collateralizable assets ( higher). These sector characteristics
are more relevant the lower …nancial contractibility



is. Thus, …rms in …nancially vulnerable

industries …nd it relatively easier to export from countries with a more developed …nancial system.
Credit constraints therefore redistribute exports in two ways: towards …nancially less vulnerable
sectors, and towards more productive …rms within a sector.
While the level e¤ect of …nancial development might become ambiguous under alternative
modeling assumptions, its di¤erential impact across sectors would remain robust. First, both
e¤ects would hold if …rms also incurred …xed costs in domestic production and required external
capital for their …nancing (see footnote 7). Second, in general equilibrium, the sunk costs of
entry would pin down a free-entry condition which imposes zero expected pro…ts. Improvements
in …nancial contractibility could no longer reduce the productivity cut-o¤ for exporting in all
sectors, since the higher probability of foreign sales would generate positive expected pro…ts and
violate the free-entry condition. This e¤ect would be magni…ed in large open economies, where a

fall in the exporting cut-o¤ could raise the price index in the destination as less productive …rms
are able to sell there, thereby further increasing expected export pro…ts. In general equilibrium,
…nancial development would therefore reduce the cut-o¤ for exporting in the …nancially most
vulnerable sectors but raise it in the least vulnerable sectors. All other di¤erential e¤ects of
…nancial development across industries derived below would similarly hold in general equilibrium.
Trade occurs only if there are at least some …rms with productivity above the 1 cut-o¤.
Proposition 1 thus implies that credit constraints generate systematic variation in the probability
of positive bilateral exports across countries and sectors:
Proposition 2 (Nonzero) Country  is more likely to export to country  if  is more …nancially
developed. This e¤ ect is more pronounced in …nancially vulnerable sectors.
Since …rms manufacture di¤erentiated goods, the lower the productivity cut-o¤ for exporting,
the greater the measure of exporters and the bigger the range of products the country sells abroad.
Thus, the comparative statics for 1 also apply to the product variety of countries’exports:
Proposition 3 (Product variety) The more …nancially developed country  is, the more products
it exports to country . This e¤ ect is more pronounced in …nancially vulnerable sectors.

4.5

Firm-level exports

In addition to restricting the number of …rms that become exporters, credit constraints can also
distort …rm-level exports if …rms require external funds for both …xed and variable costs. I
now relax the assumption that …rms …nance variable costs internally and posit that exporters in
sector  need to raise outside capital for a fraction  of all costs associated with foreign sales.
This a¤ects …rm pro…ts and investors’expected returns in (2), as well as the condition that the
investor’s repayment when the contract is enforced do not exceed the …rm’s net revenues.
As Online Appendix A proves, now two productivity cut-o¤s characterize …rms’trade activity.
This is illustrated by the graph of export pro…ts in Figure 3B. While all …rms with productivity
above a certain threshold 1
 become exporters, only …rms with productivity above a higher

cut-o¤ 1
  1 export at the price and quantity levels that obtain in the absence of credit

constraints. Firms with productivity below 1
 would not earn su¢ cient export revenues to
repay the investor if they exported at …rst-best levels. Instead, they choose to export lower
quantities than the unconstrained optimum in order to reduce their requirement for external
capital ncessary for …nancing variable costs. This allows them to meet the investor’s participation
constraint with a lower repayment  (). In this way, …rms of intermediate productivity ensure
that they can earn some export pro…ts, albeit lower than the …rst-best.

Online Appendix A shows that Proposition 1 holds for both 1
 and 1 . In other

words, more …rms in …nancially vulnerable sectors can export and export at optimal scale if
they are from …nancially developed countries. In addition, the distortion to the revenues of …rms
exporting at second-best levels also varies systematically across countries and sectors:
11

Proposition 4 (Firm-level exports) When …rms face credit constraints in the …nancing of both
…xed and variable costs, high-productivity exporters export at …rst-best levels but low-productivity
exporters export less. The export revenues of …rms producing at second-best levels are higher for
…rms in …nancially developed countries, especially in …nancially vulnerable sectors.13

 is too high, no …rm is productive

 and the proportion of
…rms exporting  
 . On the other hand,  re‡ects the share of …rms exporting at …rstbest levels and captures any e¤ect of credit constraints on average …rm-level exports.
Given Propositions 1 and 4, it immediately follows that …nancially developed countries have
a comparative advantage in sectors intensive in outside …nance and intangible assets:
Proposition 5 (Trade volumes) The more …nancially developed country  is, the higher the
value of its exports to country . This e¤ ect is more pronounced in …nancially vulnerable sectors.

Empirical speci…cation

The model delivers a number of testable predictions for the e¤ect of …nancial development on
countries’export activity. This section derives an estimation procedure for these implications.
The impact of …nancial development on 1
 across sectors at di¤erent levels of external …nance dependence is
theoretically ambiguous. This occurs because more productive …rms can o¤er greater revenues in case of repayment,
but they also require more external capital for their variable costs since they operate at a larger scale. Online

Appendix A presents the condition necessary for   

Following Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008) (henceforth HMR), I assume that both

is a close resemblance between the estimating equations for  and  because both are driven
by the selection of …rms into exporting through the productivity cut-o¤ 1
 . However, while
(8) analyzes zero versus positive trade ‡ows with Probit, (9) examines the extensive margin of
positive exports with OLS. Note also that the mass of domestically active …rms  only enters
the equation for product variety.

To test Proposition 5, I derive an estimating equation for the value of bilateral exports  in

are exporter, importer and

sector …xed e¤ects, respectively,  = ln  and  = ln  .
Financial frictions can reduce bilateral exports  through three channels: the selection of
…rms into production ( ), the selection of producers into exporting ( ), and …rm exports
( ). While the model has focused on the latter two channels, in a fuller model with credit
constraints in domestic production as well as in exporting,  would also depend on countries’
14

…nancial development and sectors’…nancial vulnerability. The comparative statics for the productivity cut-o¤ for domestic production would then mimic those for the exporting threshold.
The prior literature has counfounded these three e¤ects by performing reduced-form analyses
that do not control for the the mass of active …rms  . It is therefore not clear whether these
earlier …ndings re‡ect an e¤ect of credit constraints speci…c to trade activity or a general impact
on production. Previous studies have also examined only positive trade ‡ows and ignored the
consequences of …nancial frictions for the selection of …rms into exporting  .
I estimate (10) with a two-stage structural procedure in the spirit of HMR, which uses the
information in both zero and positive bilateral exports. In the …rst stage, I obtain the predicted
probability of exporting from  to  in sector , b , from the Probit speci…cation in (8), and derive
¬
an estimate for the latent variable   = as b = ¬1 b . I then construct a consistent

estimate for  from  = max



¬ 1 0 , where

=

( ¬  + 1)  ( ¬ 1). In the

second stage, I estimate (10) controlling for  and the imputed measure of  . Since …xed
export costs  directly a¤ect only the extensive margin of trade, they enter only the …rst stage
and provide the exclusion restriction necessary for the identi…cation of the second stage.
In the second stage, I also include measures of countries’ …nancial institutions and sectors’
…nancial vulnerability, and observe whether they a¤ect bilateral exports above and beyond the
selection of …rms into domestic production and into exporting. Once  and  are controlled
for, any residual impact of credit constraints on  represents an e¤ect on the unobserved
…rm-level exports.
The error term  in (10) is correlated with  because the error term in the equation
for  (7) is



 +

 .

Any positive correlation between trade barriers  and 

may also generate sample selection bias: country pairs with high observable trade costs 
that trade with each other likely have low unobserved costs, i.e. high  . The consistent
estimation of (10) thus requires controlling for …rm selection into exporting conditional on positive
exports,  [ j  = 1], as well as the standard Heckman correction forh sample selection,
i
¬
 [ j  = 1] =     (  = )  . Both terms depend on    j  = 1 , for

which a consistent estimate is given by the inverse Mills ratio, b =

b  in the second stage of the estimation
and  [ j  = 1], respectively. Including b and 

thus produces consistent estimates and accounts for the selection of …rms in exporting.
b  depends on two assumptions: the joint normality
The exact construction of b and 
of the unobserved trade costs  and

 ,

and the Pareto distribution of …rm productivity. In

robustness checks, I …rst drop the second assumption and use a polynomial in the estimated
b  . I then relax both assumptions and control directly for the
latent variable b instead of 

predicted probabilities of exporting b . These robustness checks leave my results unchanged.

5.4

Firm dynamics

The analysis so far has examined the e¤ects of …nancial frictions in a static world. I now
consider how stochastic trade costs interact with credit constraints and determine the product
composition of countries’exports over time. For simplicity, I assume that …rms require outside
…nance only for their …xed export costs, which are i.i.d. across …rms and over time.14 I further
assume that in each period …rms observe a low cost  with probability  and a high cost 
with probability (1 ¬ ). Hence, in making their export decisions, each period …rms solve the
maximization problem in (2) for the …xed cost they draw that period.

Two productivity cut-o¤s now de…ne …rms’ export behavior. These cut-o¤s are given by
equation (4), with the …xed cost set to  and  , respectively. Firms with productivity above
the higher cut-o¤ 1 are always able to export. Firms with productivity below the lower
cut-o¤ 1 never sell abroad, either because they could not pro…tably do so or because they
are credit constrained. Firms in the intermediate range of productivity (1

1  1 )

export if and only if they observe a low trade cost. The endogenous entry and exit of these
marginal exporters drives …rm dynamicsnin trade. h
io
The mass of exporters is  =   ( ) +    ¬  ( ) , since in any period

a fraction  of all marginal exporters observe a low trade cost and export. In the next period, a
fraction (1 ¬ ) of these …rms draw a high export cost and exit. In equilibrium,  is constant

over time, the exit rate

exactly equals the entry rate, and is given by

(11)

From Proposition 1, the two productivity cut-o¤s for exporting are lower in …nancially developed countries, especially in …nancially vulnerable sectors. Given the equivalence of …rm and
product variety, and a productivity distribution with no unit point masses, it follows that:
Proposition 6 (Product churning) Financial development increases …rm and product survival
in countries’exports over time. This e¤ ect is more pronounced in …nancially vulnerable sectors.

14

Proposition 6 holds if …rms need external …nance for both …xed and variable costs. While very productive …rms
would always export at …rst-best levels, a band of …rms would switch between exporting at …rst- and second-best
levels depending on their …xed cost draw. Their switching would not a¤ect the overall mass of exporting …rms.
15
In a dynamic model with sunk costs, the e¤ects of …nancial development on turnover can be ambiguous: While

16

Multiple export destinations

While the focus so far has been on …rms’exports to a particular country , in reality producers
can sell to multiple destinations. In the absence of …nancial frictions, …rms enter all markets that
o¤er positive expected pro…ts. With credit constraints, however, the decision to service country
 is not independent from the decision to service country , because …rms have limited collateral
with which to secure external …nance for all of their foreign activities.
To maximize total pro…ts, …rms therefore export to the  most pro…table markets in the world
for which they can raise su¢ cient funds. All else equal, bigger economies o¤er …rms higher export
pro…ts and a lower productivity cut-o¤ for exporting (see equation (4)). Firms thus optimally
add export destinations in decreasing order of market size until they exhaust the total amount
of outside capital they can obtain: If a …rm increases the number of its trade partners from 
to ( + 1) countries, it continues exporting to the  largest economies in the world and targets
the next biggest market as its ( + 1)st destination. More productive exporters supply more
destinations because their higher revenues allow them to go further down this pecking order of
trade partners.16 Online Appendix B formally establishes these results.
Note that a country exports to a given destination only if at least one …rm sells there. Since
the productivity cut-o¤ for exporting depends on the exporter’s level of …nancial development,
the importer’s market size, and the sector’s …nancial vulnerability, the following holds:
Proposition 7 (Trade partners) The more …nancially developed country  is, the more countries
it exports to. This e¤ ect is more pronounced in …nancially vulnerable sectors.
Proposition 8 (Pecking order of trade) All countries export to the largest economies in the
world. The more …nancially developed country  is, the more likely it is to also export to smaller
destination markets. This e¤ ect is more pronounced in …nancially vulnerable sectors.

it would still improve …rm survival by facilitating the …nancing of temporary cost shocks, it would also ease the

empirical results pick up a net e¤ect and imply that the former e¤ect dominates. See Dixit (1989a,b), Roberts

Data

The empirical analysis uses data on bilateral exports for 107 countries and 27 sectors over the
1985-1995 period.17 A sector is de…ned as a 3-digit category in the ISIC industry classi…cation
system. I obtain trade ‡ows at the 4-digit SITC Rev.2 industry level from Feenstra’s World
Trade Database and use Haveman’s concordance tables to aggregate the data to 3-digit ISIC
sectors. In the absence of detailed cross-country trade data at the …rm level, I measure the
product variety of countries’ exports with the number of 4-digit SITC groups exported within
a 3-digit ISIC sector. In robustness tests, I also examine the number of 10-digit HS products
shipped, available speci…cally for US imports from the US Imports, Exports and Tari¤ Data.
My main measure of …nancial development is the amount of credit by banks and other …nancial intermediaries to the private sector as a share of GDP (private credit), which I obtain from
Beck et al. (2000). Conceptually, establishing a credit constraints channel requires a measure
of the level of …nancial contractibility or, more generally, of the capacity of the environment
to provide external …nancing. While direct measures are not available, the size of the …nancial
system is an objective and outcome-based variable that re‡ects the actual use of external funds.
This makes it an appropriate proxy for the economy’s potential to support …nancial relationships. Private credit has been used extensively in the …nance and growth literature (Rajan and
Zingales 1998; Braun 2003; Aghion et al. 2010), as well as in most papers on …nance and trade.
Private credit varies signi…cantly in the panel. Panel A in Appendix Table 1 lists the 107
countries and gives the mean and standard deviation of their private credit over the 1985-1995
period. The bottom two rows summarize the cross-sectional variation of the country averages,
as well as the panel-wide variation of the annual data. In the median country (India), private
credit was 25.6% of GDP over this period and ‡uctuated between 21.9% and 31.1%. In the
cross-section, private credit spans the 2.3% (Uganda) to 163% (Japan) range, and in the panel
as a whole it varies from 0.4% (Guinea-Bissau, 1989) to 179% (Japan, 1995) with a mean of
39.7% and standard deviation of 34.9%.
For robustness I also use indices for the repudiation of contracts, accounting standards, and
the risk of expropriation from La Porta et al. (1998). While these indicators do not directly
measure the probability that …nancial contracts are enforced, they re‡ect the general contractual
environment in a country, which applies to …nancial contracting as well. These proxies are
available for a subset of countries, and do not vary over time (see Panel B).
The industry measures of …nancial vulnerability follow closely their de…nitions in the model
and are standard in the literature. They come from Braun (2003), and are based on data for all
publicly listed US-based companies from Compustat’s annual industrial …les. External …nance
dependence is the share of capital expenditures not …nanced with cash ‡ows from operations.
Asset tangibility records the share of net property, plant and equipment in total book-value
17

All results also hold in the cross-section for individual years.

18

assets.18 Both measures are averaged over 1986-1995 for the median …rm in each industry, and
appear very stable over time when compared to indices for 1976-1985 and 1966-1975.
While the measure of external …nance dependence is not available speci…cally for expenditures related to international trade, it is an appropriate proxy for three reasons. First, …rms need
to incur the same production costs in manufacturing for the foreign market as in manufacturing
for the home country. Second, products that entail a lot of R&D, marketing research and distribution costs at home plausibly also require similarly large …xed costs for product customization,
marketing and distribution networks in foreign markets. Both of these factors imply that whatever forces a …rm in a particular industry to fund its domestic operations with outside capital
will also force it to use external funds for its sales abroad. Finally, the empirical measure is based
on large US companies that are typically big exporters. It thus re‡ects their total requirement
for external …nance and not just that for their domestic activities.
Constructing the industry measures from US data is motivated by two considerations. First,
the United States have one of the most advanced and sophisticated …nancial systems, which makes
it reasonable that the measures re‡ect …rms’ optimal choice over external …nancing and asset
structure. Second, using the US as the reference country is convenient because of limited data
for many other countries, but it also ensures that the measures are not endogenous to …nancial
development. In fact, if some of the very external capital intensive industries in the US use more
internal …nancing in countries with worse credit markets, the coe¢ cient on    
would be underestimated. Similarly, if companies compensate with more tangible assets for a
lower level of …nancial development,     would be underestimated.
While identi…cation does not require that industries have exactly the same level of …nancial
vulnerability in every country, it does rely on the ranking of sectors remaining relatively stable
across countries. Rajan and Zingales (1998) and Braun (2003) argue that the measures they
construct capture a large technological component that is innate to the manufacturing process
in a sector and are thus good proxies for ranking industries in all countries. They point out that
the measures vary substantially more across sectors than among companies within an industry.
The …nancial vulnerability measures for the 27 sectors in my sample are listed in Appendix
Table 2. Most US …rms …nance between half a percent (non-ferrous metals) and 96% (professional
and scienti…c equipment) of their capital expenditures with external funds, for an average of 25%.
The industries with the lowest levels of tangibility are pottery, china, and earthenware; leather
products; and wearing apparel. Assets are hardest in petroleum re…neries; paper and products;
iron and steel; and industrial chemicals. Identifying both interaction terms in the estimating
equations is possible because the two industry variables are only weakly correlated at -0.04.
Appendix A describes all other variables used in the empirical analysis.
18

A …rm’s book value includes a number of other assets that are arguably less tangible and can either not be
liquidated or liquidated at a signi…cant loss by an outside investor in case of default. Such softer assets comprise
goodwill, research and development, the associated human capital, organizational capital, and even accounts
receivables, cash, inventory and related investments.

Credit constraints and export patterns in the data

7.1

Bilateral export ‡ows

I begin by showing that …nancially developed countries indeed have a comparative advantage
in …nancially vulnerable sectors. In Column 1 of Table 2, I regress (log) bilateral exports on
the exporter’s level of private credit and its interactions with the industry measures of external
…nance dependence and asset tangibility. Financially advanced economies export relatively more
in sectors that require more outside capital and in sectors with few collateralizable assets. This
result obtains controlling for the market size (GDP) of the two trade partners and the distance
between them. This speci…cation can be seen as a reduced-form version of equation (10).19 It
includes exporter, importer and sector …xed e¤ects as prescribed by the model, as well as year
…xed e¤ects to capture common time trends in the panel. I cluster errors by exporter-importer
pair, since the error term in (10) re‡ects unobserved variation in bilateral trade costs.
Column 2 isolates the e¤ect of …nancial frictions on trade above and beyond that on overall
production, by explicitly controlling for the (log) number of establishments in the exporting
country by year and sector,  in (10). 75%-80% of the total e¤ect of credit market imperfections
on exports is independent of their e¤ect on output. The prior literature has thus overestimated
the impact of …nancial frictions speci…c to trade by about 25%. This is one of the …rst pieces of
evidence that this impact is large and not driven by cross-border sales scaling proportionately
with domestic activity. I have con…rmed that more establishments are indeed active in …nancially
developed countries, especially in …nancially vulnerable sectors (available on request). This
…nding is in itself new and consistent with earlier work on …nance and growth. Of note, all
results in the paper are robust to alternatively controlling for (log) output by country, year and
sector (see Column 3). While this is not called for by the model, it provides a more conservative
estimation approach that might or might not emerge from other theoretical frameworks.20
The model also posits that the estimation of bilateral exports control for the sector-speci…c
price index in the importing country, something no prior study on trade and …nance has done.
In the absence of a direct measure for  , I use three di¤erent proxies and …nd my results
unchanged. In Column 4, I include the importer’s CPI and its interactions with a full set of
sector dummies. In Column 5, I condition instead on the importer’s (log) total consumption
by sector, computed as the sum of domestic production and net imports. In the last column, I
employ importer-sector …xed e¤ects. The choice of  proxy a¤ects my results minimally, and
below I present estimates only using the importer’s CPI interacted with sector dummies.
The e¤ect of credit constraints on bilateral exports is highly statistically and economically
signi…cant. For example, if the Philippines, the country at the …rst quartile of the distribution

Because the importer’s GDP varies over time, it is not subsumed by the importer …xed e¤ects. One can rewrite
(10) to include the exporter’s GDP. Bilateral distance proxies for the iceberg trade cost in the model.
20
All results in the paper are also robust to controlling for the exporter’s output growth by year and sector in
addition to any other controls in the reported tables.

of private credit, were to improve its …nancial system to the level at the third quartile (Italy),
its textile exports (highly dependent on external …nance, 3rd quartile) would rise 19 percentage points more than its mineral products exports (intensive in internal funding, 1st quartile).
Similarly, exports of low tangibility sectors (other chemicals, 1st quartile) would grow by 17
percentage points more than exports of high tangibility sectors (wood products, 3rd quartile).21
Table 3 con…rms the robustness of these results. Columns 1 and 2 establish that the two
interaction terms identify distinct economic mechanisms and enter with the same magnitude and
signi…cance when included one at a time.22 The remainder of the table accounts for traditional
sources of comparative advantage by controlling for the interaction of countries’(log) per capita
endowments of natural resources, physical and human capital with sectors’ respective factor
intensities. I also ensure that the impact of …nancial development is independent of the e¤ects
of other institutions that are positively correlated with private credit. In particular, I control
for the interactions of the exporter’s overall rule of law and level of corruption with the industry
measures of …nancial vulnerability. Finally, I interact these industry measures with per capita
GDP to isolate an e¤ect of …nancial development separate from that of overall development.
I …nd that …nancially advanced economies export relatively more in sectors intensive in outside …nance and intangible assets even after accounting for all of these alternative sources of
comparative advantage. The e¤ects are also robust to the choice of …nancial contractibility measure. Using indices of contract repudiation, accounting standards and the risk of expropriation
produces similarly signi…cant results. These …ndings present strong support for Proposition 5.23
Table 3 implies that credit constraints have sizeable economic e¤ects not only in absolute
terms, but also relative to traditional Heckscher-Ohlin sources of comparative advantage. The
impact of a one-standard-deviation improvement in …nancial development is of the same magnitude as that of a one-standard-deviation rise in human capital endowments and substantially
larger than that of a one-standard-deviation increase in the stock of physical capital.
These results are summarized in the top row of Table 9, which shows how much of the
variation in the data can be explained by …nancial development. Each cell reports on a di¤erent
comparative static exercise. The relevant trade outcome and hypothetical change are indicated in
the row and column headings, respectively. For example, Column 1 shows that a one-standarddeviation expansion in a country’s private credit would increase its exports in the sector at
the 75th percentile of the distribution by external …nance dependence by 15 percentage points
more than its exports in the sector at the 25th percentile. Exports in the sector at the 25th
percentile of the distribution by asset tangibility would similarly grow 14 percentage points more
than exports in the sector at the 75th percentile (Column 2). The corresponding numbers for the
e¤ects of a one-standard-deviation improvement in contract enforcement are 20 and 30 percentage
21

Comparative statics based on Column 4 in Table 2.
All other results in the paper are also robust to including only one of the two interaction terms at a time.
23
In unreported results, I have con…rmed that my …ndings are not driven by …nancially underdeveloped countries
having systematically lower or higher real exchange rates. See Russ and Valderrama (2009) on the link between
…nancial development and real exchange rates in general equilibrium.

points, respectively (Columns 3 and 4). By comparison, the impact of a one-standard-deviation
increase in physical (human) capital stocks on exports of the sector at the 75th percentile of the
distribution by physical (human) capital intensity is 9 percentage points smaller (32 percentage
points bigger) than that on exports of the sector at the 25th percentile (Columns 5 and 6).24
My results also suggest that …nancial development can account for a large share of the growth
in global trade between 1985 and 1995. Using my estimates and data on the actual change in
countries’private credit, I predict how countries’worldwide exports by sector would evolve over
this period as a result of …nancial development, holding all other variables …xed at their 1985
levels. In Table 10, I regress the actual on the predicted value of exports and the actual on the
predicted change in exports. As the R-squared in Columns 1 and 4 show, …nancial development
alone can explain 22% of the growth in trade ‡ows and 85% of the variation in export levels
across countries and sectors in 1995.25
To put this into perspective, note that it is roughly twice the predictive power of factor
accumulation. I repeat the exercise above, this time using data on the actual change in countries’
factor endowments to project the evolution of trade ‡ows. Holding the level of private credit and
all other variables …xed at their 1985 levels, I …nd that changes in exporters’natural resources,
physical and human capital can account for only 12% of the change in trade ‡ows and 65% of
the variation in export levels in 1995 (Columns 2 and 5). When both the predicted values based
on …nancial development and on factor accumulation enter the regression, the point estimates
and signi…cance of the former remain unchanged. By contrast, the latter is either insigni…cant
(Column 3) or its beta coe¢ cient is half that on …nancial development (Column 6). These results
also hold when I condition on country …xed e¤ects (available on request).
While establishing causality has typically been di¢ cult in the …nance and trade (and …nance
and growth) literature, the results presented here do suggest a causal e¤ect of credit constraints
on trade patterns. Reverse causality could arise because an increase in relative foreign demand
for sectors intensive in external funds might lead to both higher exports from these industries
and to more borrowing in the economy, as measured by private credit. This mechanism could
generate the result that …nancially developed countries export relatively more in external capital
dependent sectors even in the absence of credit constraints.26
The same argument, however, cannot explain the signi…cant e¤ect of the interaction of private
credit with asset tangibility. If credit markets were frictionless, the availability of collateralizable
assets would not matter for a sector’s ability to raise outside capital. Holding …nancial dependence constant, the sectoral composition of export demand would then not a¤ect private credit.
The result that …nancially underdeveloped countries export less in sectors with fewer tangible
24

The counter-intuitive results for countries’physical capital are due to the negative coe¢ cient on its interaction
with sectors’physical capital intensity. This interaction turns positive for some trade outcomes below.
25
This di¤erence in R-squared is mostly due to the fact that export paterns typically changed little between
1985 and 1995 relative to export levels in 1985.
26
Braun and Raddatz (2008) and Do and Levchenko (2007) …nd that trade openness can stimulate …nancial
development, reinforcing the concern that causality might run from trade to …nancial development.

22

assets is thus strong evidence of a credit constraints channel.27 Finally, using time-invariant
measures of contractibility (contract repudiation, accounting standards and the risk of expropriation) further helps with establishing causality as these variables do not respond to variation in
export demand the way private credit might.

7.2

Zero and positive exports

I next implement the two-stage estimation procedure outlined in Sections 5.1 and 5.3, and decompose the e¤ect of credit constraints on bilateral exports (beyond that on output) into the
component due to …rm selection into exporting and that due to average …rm-level exports.
This approach requires the use of an empirical proxy for the …xed costs of international
trade, which a¤ect …rms’export status but not the scale of their sales. In the absence of direct
trade cost measures, I exploit data on the regulation costs of …rm entry from Djankov et al.
(2002).28 This choice is motivated by the presumption that countries which set high regulatory
barriers to …rms’domestic activity also impose high …xed costs on …rms’cross-border operations.
Entry costs are measured by the number of days, the number or procedures, and the monetary
cost (relative to GDP per capita) to an entrepreneur of legally starting a business. For each of
these variables, I take the (log) average value for the exporting and importing country. I thus
obtain three proxies for the …xed cost of exporting for each country pair. As the results below
con…rm, higher regulatory hurdles indeed deter countries from engaging in international trade.
Moreover, by their nature, such barriers capture only the …xed cost of doing business and thus
meet the exclusion restriction of no direct e¤ect on the variable costs of trade and the level of
…rm exports.29
Proposition 2 states that …nancially developed countries are more likely to export bilaterally
and that this advantage is more pronounced in …nancially vulnerable sectors. I test this prediction
by estimating equation (8) with a Probit speci…cation. As the outcome measure, I use an indicator
variable equal to 1 if country  exports to country  in sector  and year . I condition on exporter,
importer, sector and year …xed e¤ects, and control for the sector price index in the importing
country and both partners’GDP. Since both variable and …xed trade costs a¤ect …rms’export
status, I include both bilateral distance and the three regulatory cost measures in the regression.
In the absence of comprehensive cross-country data at the …rm level, this speci…cation also
implicitly tests how credit constraints a¤ect …rm selection into exporting.
Table 4 presents strong empirical evidence in support of Proposition 2. Financially developed
countries are more likely to enter a given market, and this e¤ect is stronger in sectors that require
27

To establish causality, prior researchers have instrumented for private credit with legal origin. All of my
results hold with this IV approach. However, legal origin has been shown to impact institution formation and
the economy more broadly, which in turn are likely to a¤ect sectors di¤erentially. It is thus not obvious that this
instrument meets the exclusion restriction.
28
Since historical data are not available, I use regulation cost data for 1999.
29
Very similar results obtain if I instead use an indicator variable equal to 1 when at least one of the two trade
partners is an island as the exclusion restriction (available on request).

23

more outside …nance or have fewer tangible assets. This result is independent of other sources of
comparative advantage, such as factor endowments, the overall level of development, and other
institutions. It is also robust to the choice of …nancial contractibility measure.
I next estimate the e¤ect of credit constraints on average …rm exports predicted by Proposition 4. This requires including a measure of …rm selection into exporting  , as well as the
standard Heckman correction for sample selection in the speci…cation for bilateral trade ‡ows.
To this end, I obtain the predicted probability of exporting b from each Probit regression in
¬
Table 4 and estimate the latent variable b = ¬1 b . I also compute the disturbance term
conditional on positive bilateral exports, b =

that  conditional on positive trade is a nonlinear function of the imputed variables, 

Panel A of Table 5 presents the results from the second stage MLE. Exporting …rms from

…nancially developed countries earn signi…cantly larger foreign revenues on average, and this
e¤ect is magni…ed in …nancially vulnerable sectors. In view of the model, this suggests that
…nancial development allows more …rms to export at …rst-best levels and/or increases the sales
of …rms operating at second-best. These results lend support to Proposition 4.
I gauge the relative importance of credit constraints for the extensive and intensive margins
of trade by comparing the coe¢ cient estimates in the second stage to OLS estimates of the same
b  and b corrections (results not reported). I …nd that 30%-40% of
regression without the 
the total e¤ect of …nancial development on export volumes results from fewer …rms becoming
exporters, whereas 60%-70% is due to depressed …rm-level exports. The exact decomposition

varies across speci…cations and depends on the sector measure of …nancial vulnerability (see
Appendix Table 3). These results indicate that …rms face substantial credit constraints in the

I then also relax the assumption of the joint normality of the unobserved …xed and variable
trade costs,  and  in the model. This implies that the disturbance term b and the latent

variable b can no longer be exactly imputed from the predicted probability of exporting b .

I control instead directly for these b ’s by grouping them into 50 bins and using dummies for
each bin in an OLS second stage regression. As the evidence in Panel C shows, the same robust
results obtain in this very ‡exible speci…cation.

are not only statistically highly signi…cant, but also of considerable economic magnitude. The
comparative statics in the second and third rows of Table 9 illustrate this both in absolute terms
and relative to the economic signi…cance of factor-endowment di¤erences across countries.
A one-standard-deviation rise in contract enforcement is associated with a 19% higher probability of exporting and 15% larger …rm exports in a sector reliant on outside …nance (75th
percentile) relative to a sector with little need for external capital (25th percentile). The corresponding di¤erential e¤ects across sectors at di¤erent levels of asset tangibility are 17% and 25%,
respectively. The estimated impact of a one-standard-deviation improvement in private credit
is somewhat smaller. These e¤ects are on par with those of a one-standard-deviation rise in a
country’s human capital endowment, which would boost the probability of exporting and …rmlevel exports by 15% and 30% more in a human-capital intensive sector (75th percentile) relative
to a human-capital scarce industry (25th percentile). By contrast, the impact of a comparable
change in physical capital stocks is only a …fth to an eighth as large.

7.3

Product variety and product churning

I next examine the consequences of …nancial frictions for the product composition of countries’
exports. In particular, I estimate equation (9) with the (log) number of 4-digit SITC product
groups exported bilaterally within a 3-digit ISIC sector as the outcome variable. Since a 4-digit
product category itself encompasses an unobserved range of products, using this measure likely
underestimates the true impact of credit constraints on product scope.
Consistently with Proposition 3, I …nd that …nancially advanced economies export a wider
range of products in industries intensive in outside …nance and intangible assets (Panel A of
Table 6). These e¤ects are not driven by other sources of comparative advantage such as factor
endowments, overall development or other institutions. In addition, the …ndings obtain controlling for the number of active establishments in the exporting country and sector, the importer’s
price index, the market size of and distance between the two trade partners, and a full set of
exporter, importer, sector and year …xed e¤ects.
The economic signi…cance of credit constraints is considerable, as can be seen in Table 9:
A one-standard-deviation rise in the index of contract repudiation, for example, would increase
the average country’s export product scope by 8-10 percentage points more in a …nancially
vulnerable industry (3rd quartile) relative to a less vulnerable industry (1st quartile). A onestandard deviation improvement in human capital would have comparable reallocation e¤ects
across sectors at di¤erent levels of human capital intensity, while the impact of a similar growth
in physical capital would be about two-thirds smaller.
These results are robust to measuring product variety at a …ner level of disaggregation. In
Panel B of Table 6, I restrict the analysis to exports speci…cally to the US, for which it is possible
to count the number of 10-digit HS products traded within a 3-digit ISIC sector. I continue to
observe that …nancially developed countries sell more products in …nancially vulnerable sectors,

25

although the interaction with asset tangibility is often imprecisely estimated.31
The results for exporters’product scope are closely related to the earlier …nding that credit
constraints distort countries’ probability of exporting. Both patterns are consistent with the
idea that …nancial frictions interact with …rm heterogeneity and intensify the selection of …rms
into exporting. Although I do not observe the number of trading …rms, the number of products
shipped appears to capture well the extensive margin of trade: When I repeat the analysis for
product variety controlling for …rm selection into exporting with the predicted probability of
exporting, the impact of credit constraints is substantially diminished (available on request).
The model also predicts that in the presence of stochastic trade costs, credit constraints will
a¤ect the stability of exporters’ product mix over time. To examine product turnover, I focus
on the sample of exporter-importer-sector triplets with positive trade ‡ows in two consecutive
periods. This ensures that any observed product churning is not driven by large adjustments
in export conditions but characterizes an environment approximating steady-state equilibrium.
I measure the product survival rate with the ratio of the number of products traded both this
year and last year to the number of products sold last year. Similarly, I compute the product
entry rate as the number of newly introduced products this period as a share of the number of
products shipped last period.32
As Table 7 suggests, the exports of …nancially developed countries exhibit less product churning, and this e¤ect is more pronounced in …nancially vulnerable sectors. In line with Proposition
6, the survival rate of products exported by …nancially advanced economies is higher in sectors
with a greater need for external …nance and in sectors with few collateralizable assets. The opposite is true of the product entry rate. These results are robust to controlling for other sources
of comparative advantage, market size e¤ects, bilateral distance, the importer’s sectoral price
index, and a full set of country, sector and year …xed e¤ects. The patterns are also robust to the
choice of …nancial contractibility measure or level of industry disaggregation.
In economic terms, the e¤ects of credit market imperfections on export product churning are
limited (Table 9). A one-standard-deviation improvement in …nancial development would boost
product survival by only 1% more in a …nancially vulnerable sector (3rd quartile) compared to
a …nancially less vulnerable sector (1st quartile). These e¤ects are nevertheless similar to those
of a one-standard-deviation change in physical or human capital endowments.

7.4

Trade partners and the pecking order of trade

Finally, I test the model’s predictions for the number and type of countries’ trade partners.
Table 8 analyzes the systematic variation in trade partner intensity across exporting countries
and sectors in the full sample and among observations with at least one destination (Panel A).
31

All interaction terms in Panel B of Table 6 are statistically signi…cant when the dependent variable is the
number of 10-digit products exported within a sector to the US instead of the natural logarithm of that number.
32
The same results obtain if I do not restrict the sample to triplets with positive trade in consecutive periods
or if I de…ne the entry rate as the share of newly introduced products in the total number of products this period.

26

In line with Proposition 7, I …nd that …nancially developed exporters enter signi…cantly more
markets in …nancially vulnerable industries. This result obtains after controlling for exporter,
sector and year …xed e¤ects, as well as for di¤erences in factor endowments, other institutions,
overall development and market size across exporting countries. The estimates are also robust
to alternative measures of …nancial contractibility.33
Given the large e¤ects of …nancial frictions on the probability of exporting, it is not surprising
that their impact on trade partner intensity is also sizeable (Table 9). If a country improves
its contract enforcement by one standard deviation, it could add 5-6 more destinations in a
…nancially vulnerable sector (3rd quartile) relative to a less dependent industry (1st quartile).
These estimates are big given that the average number of export markets in the sample is 32.
They are comparable to the e¤ects of human capital accumulation, and much larger than those
of physical capital accretion.
Proposition 8 states that while all exporters can enter large markets, …nancially advanced
economies can also service smaller destinations, particularly in …nancially vulnerable sectors.
Indeed, the market size of countries’ largest trade partner does not vary systematically across
exporters and sectors (Panel B). In contrast, the smallest market to which …nancially developed
countries sell is signi…cantly smaller in …nancially vulnerable sectors (Panel C).34 Moreover, as
the model predicts, this e¤ect is largely driven by …nancially advanced economies exporting to
more destinations: When I control for the number of trade partners, the minimum importer
market size varies substantially less across countries and sectors (available on request).35
These results are consistent with the idea that bigger markets and the associated larger
sales revenues there make it easier for exporters to cover …xed trade costs. This implies that,
while …nancial development allows countries to export more products and more of each product
to every market, its e¤ect on product variety should be relatively more important for smaller
export destinations. In unreported regressions, I have con…rmed that this is indeed the case.
This is congruent with the weaker e¤ects of credit constraints on the range of products countries
export to the large US market in Panel B of Table 6.

Conclusion

This paper examines the detrimental consequences of …nancial market imperfections for international trade. It provides an overall treatment of the e¤ect of credit constraints on export ‡ows
by decomposing it into di¤erent components. To this end, I develop a heterogeneous-…rm model
with cross-country di¤erences in …nancial development and cross-industry variation in …nancial
33

All regressions in this section cluster errors by exporter.
To ensure a range of market sizes among countries’export destinations, I restrict the sample to observations
with more than 5 trade partners. I also take the GDP of the destination at the 10th percentile instead of the
minimum to guard against idiosyncracies in export patterns. The results are robust to alternative subsampling
and measures of the smallest market size.
35
The pecking order of destinations based on market size alone holds for given trade costs. I have con…rmed that
the results in Table 8 obtain after adjusting destinations’size by their bilateral distance (available on request).

vulnerability. Applying this model to a large panel of bilateral exports for 27 industries in 19851995, I show that …nancial frictions impede …rm selection into exporting as well as …rm-level
exports. As a result, weak …nancial institutions lead to fewer destination markets, lower aggregate trade volumes, reduced export product variety, and more frequent export product turnover.
These distortions are magni…ed in …nancially vulnerable sectors.
My results shed light on the mechanisms through which credit constraints hinder global
trade. First, I document that exports are a¤ected disproportionately more than overall economic
activity. In fact, only 20%-25% of the disruptions to trade ‡ows are channeled through reductions
in total output. This highlights the sensitivity of international trade to …nancial shocks, as
evidenced by the recent global …nancial crisis.
My analysis further indicates that the trade-speci…c e¤ects of credit constraints act both
on the extensive and intensive margins of trade. This implies that …rms face credit constraints
in the …nancing of both …xed and variable costs of exporting. The evidence also suggests that
…nancial frictions in‡uence trade dynamics in the presence of shocks to export pro…tability. These
conclusions raise the possibility that …nancial underdevelopment could play an important role in
the adjustment to trade reforms, exchange rate movements, and other cost or demand shocks.
The policy implications of such impacts make them a fruitful area for future research.

GDP and GDP per capita: from the Penn World Tables 6.1.
Corruption and rule of law: from La Porta et al. (1998).
Physical and human capital endowments per capita: from Caselli (2005). The stock
of physical capital is obtained according to the perpetual inventory method as  =  + ¬1 ,
where  is investment and is the depreciation rate. The initial capital stock  is computed as
0  ( + ), where 0 is the earliest value of investment available, and  is the average geometric
growth rate of investment before 1970. Human capital per worker is calculated from the average
years of schooling in a country with Mincerian non-linear returns to education. It is measured
as  =  (), where  is the average years of schooling in the population over 25 years old, and
 () is piecewise linear with slope 013 for  4, 010 for 4   8, and 007 for 8  .

Table 1. Export Patterns in the Data
This table summarizes the variation in export activity across 161 countries and 27 sectors in 1995. A sector is defined at the 3-digit level in
the ISIC industry classification. The table reports summary statistics for countries' number of trade partners by sector, as well as their
export volumes, product scope and product churning in bilateral exports by sector. All summary statistics are for the sample with positive
trade values, except for the first row in the table. Product churning by count is defined as the average of the number of products exported
in 1994 which were discontinued in 1995 and the number of newly introduced products, as a share of the average number of products
traded in 1994. Product churning by volume is the average of two ratios: the share of the volume of trade in products discontinued after
1994 to total bilateral exports in 1994, and the share of the volume of trade in newly introduced products to total bilateral exports in 1995.
Products are defined in the 4-digit SITC industry classification (all destinations) or in the 10-digit HS classification (exports to the U.S.).

This table examines the effect of credit constraints on export volumes. The dependent variable is (log) exports from country j to country i in
a 3-digit ISIC sector s and year t , 1985-1995. Financial development is measured by private credit. External finance dependence Ext fin
dep and asset tangibility Tang are defined in the text. (Log) # Establish and (Log) Output are the (log) number of domestic establishments
and (log) output in the exporting country by year and sector. The sectoral price index in the importing country is proxied by the importer's
consumer price index (CPI) and its interactions with sector dummies in Column 4; the importer's consumption by sector in Column 5; and a
full set of importer-sector fixed effects in Column 6. LGDPE , LGDPI and LDIST indicate the (log) real GDP of the exporting and importing
country and the (log) distance between them. All regressions include a constant term, exporter, importer, sector, and year fixed effects, and
cluster errors by exporter-importer pair. Importer-sector fixed effects replace the importer and sector fixed effects in Column 6. T-statistics in

Table 3. Financial Development and Export Volumes: Robustness
This table examines the robustness of the effect of credit constraints on export volumes. The dependent variable is the (log) value of exports
from country j to country i in a 3-digit ISIC sector s and year t , 1985-1995. The measure of financial development is indicated by the column
heading. External finance dependence Ext fin dep and asset tangibility Tang are defined in the text. All regressions control for the exporter's
(log) number of domestic establishments; the importer's CPI and its interactions with sector dummies; the (log) real GDP of both trade
partners and the (log) distance between them. Columns 3-6 also control for factor endowments (natural resources, physical and human
capital) and their interactions with sector factor intensities; the exporter's GDP per capita LGDPCE; and the interactions of LGDPCE , rule of
law and corruption with Ext fin dep and Tang. All regressions include a constant term, exporter, importer, sector, and year fixed effects; and
cluster errors by exporter-importer pair. T-statistics in parenthesis. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level.

Table 4. Financial Development and Firm Selection into Exporting
This table examines the effect of credit constraints on firm selection into exporting. The dependent variable is an
indicator variable equal to 1 if country j exports to country i in a 3-digit ISIC sector s and year t , 1985-1995. The
measure of financial development is indicated by the column heading. External finance dependence Ext fin dep and
asset tangibility Tang are defined in the text. All regressions control for the average number of procedures and days
it takes to establish a business in the exporting and importing countries, and the cost of doing so as a share of GDP
per capita. All regressions include a constant term, exporter, importer, sector, and year fixed effects; the importer's
CPI and its interactions with sector dummies; the (log) real GDP of both partners and the (log) distance between
them; factor endowments, institutions, GDP per capita, and their interactions as in Table 3. Errors clustered by
exporter-importer pair. T-statistics in parenthesis. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level.

Table 9. Economic Significance: Comparative Statics
This table examines the economic significance of the effects of credit constraints on trade. Each cell reports on a different comparative static
exercise based on coefficient estimates from regressions in Tables 2-8. The relevant trade outcome is indicated in the row heading. All values
are in percentage points, except for the change in trade partner intensity which is in absolute levels. Column 1 (Column 3) shows how much
bigger the effect of a one-standard-deviation increase in private credit (repudiation of contracts) is on the sector at the 75th percentile of the
distribution by external finance dependence relative to the sector at the 25th percentile. Column 2 (Column 4) shows how much bigger the
effect of a one-standard-deviation increase in private credit (repudiation of contracts) is on the sector at the 25th percentile of the distribution
by asset tangibility relative to the sector at the 75th percentile. Column 5 (Column 6) shows how much bigger the effect of a one-standarddeviation increase in physical (human) capital endowment is on the sector at the 75th percentile of the distribution by physical (human) capital
intensity relative to the sector at the 25th percentile.

Table 10. Economic Significance: Predicted vs. Actual Trade Growth
This table examines the predictive power of improvements in financial development and changes in factor endowments for explaining
changes in trade outcomes over time. The dependent variable in Columns 1-3 is the actual level of countries' worldwide exports by sector in
1995 while in Columns 4-6 it is the actual change in countries
1995,
countries' worldwide exports by sector (in levels) between 1985 and 1995.
1995 The right
hand side variables are the corresponding changes predicted by the change in the exporting country's level of private credit and factor
endowments (natural resources, physical and human capital) between 1985 and 1995. These predicted changes are constructed using
coefficient estimates from Tables 2 and 3. All regressions include a constant term and report robust standard errors. T-statistics in
parenthesis. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the1%, 5%, and 10% level.

Appendix Table 3. Firm selection into exporting vs. firm-level exports
This table summarizes the breakdown of the effect of credit constraints on bilateral exports into fewer firms
becoming exporters and lower firm-level exports. Each cell reports the ratio of the coefficient on the
interaction of financial development with external finance dependence (asset tangibility) from a secondstage regression of (log) exports in Table 5 to the coefficient on the same interaction term in an unreported
regression of (log) exports with the same controls but no correction for firm selection into exporting, in
percentage terms. The bottom two rows of the table report the arithmetic average across all specifications.

Figure 2. Bilateral Exports and
Sectors' Financial Vulnerability

This figure plots exporters' average (log) bilateral exports across
destinations and sectors against exporters' private credit as a share of
GDP, in 1995. Only exporter-importer-sector triplets with positive trade
are included. Coeff=1.87***, R-squared=0.4303.

This figure plots average bilateral exports by sector against sectors'
external finance dependence in 1995 for Italy (70th percentile by
private credit, log GDP 20.87, log per capita GDP 9.92) and
Argentina (40th percentile by private credit, log GDP 19.69, log per
