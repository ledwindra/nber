DETECTION OF BID RIGGING IN PROCUREMENT AUCTIONS

ABSTRACT

This paper examines bidding in auctions for state highway construction

contracts on Long Island in the early 1980s, in order to determine whether bid

rigging occurred. Detection of collusion is possible because of limited
participation in the collusive scheme. The paper looks at differences in
behavior between ring members and non-members. In these auctions, collusion

did not take the form of a bid rotation scheme, in which only one ring member

submits a bid. Instead, several ring members bid on most jobs. The apparent
role of ring meetings prior to the auction was to designate a serious bidder, and

its bid, and the other firms then frequently submitted phony higher bids. The

bidding data indicate that the bids of non-cartel firms, as well as their rank
distribution, were related to cost measures, such as how much backlog a firm

was carrying. In contrast, the rank distribution of higher cartel bids was
unrelated to similar cost measures, and differed from the distribution of the low

cartel bid.

INTRODUCTION

I.

Between 1982 and 1988, more than half of the
criminal cases filed by the Antitrust Division of the

Department of Justice involved bid rigging or price
fixing in auction markets.1 Bid rigging appears to be

a pervasive, problem, with indictments in highway
construction, the distribution of school milk, utility

procurement and other auction markets. Typically, a

government agency, and hence the taxpayer, was the
victim.

This paper proposes econometric test procedures

that are designed to detect the presence of bid
rigging in procurement auctions.2 Our tests will be

poor substitutes for a wiretap or a disclosure by a
dissident ring member. However, our procedures may be
preferable to the view that patterns of bid rotation,

or relatively constant market shares, constitute
irrefutable evidence of collusion. Rotating bids are
consistent with competitive equilibria when there are

decreasing returns to scale, such as when there are

capacity constraints, as Zona (1986) demonstrates.
Lang and Rosenthal (1991) show that the noncooperative

mixed strategy equilibrium of a multiproject bidding

game, in which firms simultaneously compete

be to inflate the price paid by the buyer.

several contracts, may entail negative correlation

between a firm's bids, or an apparent bid rotation
pattern. Similarly, comparisons of winning bids and
engineers' estimates of costs, that attempt to measure

economic returns, may be unreliable.

Engineer's

estimates may be unduly influenced by historical bid
patterns, and so be an inflated measure of true costs.

In general, finding a single test procedure to
detect bid rigging is an impossible goal. As in most
tests for the exercise of market power, the idea is to
identify

differences

between

the

observable

implications of collusive and competitive behavior.
The difficulty is that both competitive and collusive
equilibria depend, to a great extent, on the economic
environment, such as the auction rules and the nature

As Hendricks and Porter

of the good being traded.

(1989) argue, collusion in auctions can take many
forms, and it is important to tailor empirical work to

specific cases. For example, a cartel might adopt a

pure bid rotation scheme, where members take turns
submitting bids in individual auctions (according to

a "phases of the moon" scheme, for example).
Alternatively, cartel members in addition to the
designated winner may submit higher complementary or

frivolous bids, perhaps to create the appearance of
competition.

It is unlikely that any single test

procedure could detect all collusive schemes, absent

data on economic returns (in which case effective

collusion might be detected by the presence of
2

persistently high profits).

As a consequence,

structural modelling and estimation are difficult,
absent more detailed information.

In environments

where complementary bids are submitted, structural
modelling may be impossible, because it is not clear
what complementary bids might be intended to maximize,

apart from being higher than the winner's bid.
If a broadly applicable test to detect collusion

could be devised, a cartel with full participation
should be able to choose complementary bids so that
the overall bid pattern passed the test. Phantom bid

schemes can be structured so that the difference

between the low and second lowest bids looks
competitive.

Presumably, an auction procedure is

employed precisely because the buyer is not aware of
the exact costs of the individual sellers. Submitted

bids could be designed to be consistent with
competitive

bidding

based

on

some

plausible

realization of seller costs.

There is a small empirical literature on
collusion in auctions.

Feinstein, Block and Nold

(1985) propose and test a model of a cartel that

manipulates engineers' estimates of the costs of
highway construction jobs, by submitting complementary

bids relatively close to the winning bid. Zona (1986)
propose a test for bid rigging itt highway construction

auctions based on a switching regression model.
Comanor and Schankerman (1976) examine the propensity

of bid rigging schemes to submit identical bids in
3

individual auctions. NcMillan (1991) describes Dango,

the negotiation among bidders for Japanese public
works contracts, that is very similar to the collusive

mechanism allegedly employed by some of the firms in
our sample.

McClave, Rothrock and Ailstock (1978)

analyze bidding patterns in Florida school bread
markets. Finally, Howard and Kaserman (1989) propose

a regression based method of calculating damages in
bid rigging cases.
Our paper examines the bidding behavior of firms

competing for state highway construction contracts on
Long Island in the early 1980s. Our data are somewhat

limited, as we shall explain, but detection of
collusion is possible because of limited participation

in the collusive scheme. Our methodology is intended
to detect differences in behavior between ring members
and nonxnembers.

Ring membership itself probably
depends on unobservable factors which differ across
firms, so that bidding differences may be structural

rather than evidence of collusion.

In our data,

collusion apparently did not take the form of a bid
rotation scheme. In that instance, collusion would be
empirically indistinguishable from the hypothesis that

submit higher

Accordingly, our procedure

distinguishes between the lowest cartel bid (recall,
this is a procurement auction in which the lowest bid

wins) and other cartel bids. We take as evidence of
collusive behavior the fact that the lowest noncartel
bidder's behavior is not statistically distinguishable

from that of other noncartel firms, whereas the
determinants of the low cartel bid differ from those

of higher cartel bids.

This discrepancy

is

characteristic of the levels of the submitted bids, as

well as their rank distribution.
Section 2 of this paper describes the structure

of New York state highway construction auctions. We

document why these auctions may be susceptible to
bidder collusion.

En addition, a subset of the

participating firms allegedly submitted noncompetitive

bids on jobs not in our data set, and therefore

constitute a candidate cartel in our data set.
Section 3 outlines an econometric model of competitive

bidding behavior. We then describe our test, which is

designed to detect departures from competition that

are consistent with the hypothesized nature of
collusive bidding. The available data are described
in more detail in Section 4, and our estimation and
test results are presented in Section 5.

II.

THE MARKET

The New York State Department of Transportation

(DOT) is required to solicit bids and award highway
contracts to the lowest responsible bidder.3 To that

end, the DOT periodically distributes a "Notice of
Highway Lettings" to a list of subscribers, to inform
them of highway construction projects to be let in the

near future.

These notices include a very brief

description of the project and a reference nunber to

be used for further information.

Fins that are

interested in submitting a bid on these projects
request plans and specifications from the Department.

A "Plan Buyers List" is also available from the DOT,

and it lists the fins that purchase plans for
specific jobs.

The list of plan buyers is also

distributed to subscribers.

On the day of the

letting, sealed bids are opened and the identity of

all bidders and their bids are announced to those
present. The low bid is accepted provided that it is

"responsible." The DOT checks calculations, compares
the bid to its own estimate of the job cost, and if it

is satisfied, awards the contract. The DOT announces
the results of the letting process, and all bids and
contracts awarded, to subscribers via the DOT notice
"Tabulation of Results."
Using the auction mechanism described above, the

DOT awarded about $120 million4 in highway contracts

from April 1979 through March 1985 in Nassau and
Suffolk Coubties on Long Island.

According to our

data, 186 contracts were let in this period, with 161

contracts awarded for less than $1 million. A total
of 66 firms bid on at least one of these 161 smaller
DOT contracts. However, only 22 firms submitted bids
on large jobs (over $1 million), and 45 percent of the

bids on large jobs were submitted by four firms.
According to local newspapers, one of the large

firms was convicted in federal court of rigging bids

on a Long Island highway construction project. While

the rigged project predates our sample, it may not

have represented an isolated event but rather a
pervasive problem that may be evident in our data. We

argue below that there are several reasons to expect

collusion in this market. We describe a particular
set of fins that may be able to profitably collude,

and we specify a mechanism of bid rigging that is

consistent with casual observation of the behavior of

these fins.
We think of collusion as an arrangement among a
group of bidders, either explicit or implicit, that is

designed to limit competition among the participants.

Limiting competition may enable the ring to increase

profits. Several features of the Nassau-Suffolk DOT

market may encourage firms to collude.

Each

significant feature of the market is described below.
Firms compete only on price. Under the terms of

the contract, the winning bidder supplies labor and
materials

and

characteristics. The definition of "output" is held

constant over all bidders, implying a de facto
homogeneous product.

Product differentiation is not

allowed. A cartel need only coordinate action in the
price dimension to collude.

The DOT policy of publicly announcing the bids
and the identity of bidders allows cartel members to
detect

deviations

from

cartel

agreements.

Undercutting or cheating would not go unnoticed. In
addition, the availability of plan buyer lists allows

ex ante common knowledge of the set of potential
bidders.

Prospective bidders know who they will be

bidding against before they submit a bid. All of this
information was readily available to firms in our data

set, since the trade associations were subscribers to

the DOT notices.

For example, the information was

routinely distributed by the contractors' association
8

to member firms.

A cartel should face less

uncertainty, and therefore perhaps be more stable, in
such an environment,

During the sample period, the DOT exhibited
almost perfectly inelastic demand. Although the state

sets an overall budget for the DOT based on requests

from the Department, demand is largely exogenous.

With one notable exception,5 every contract was
ultimately awarded to the low bidder, regardless of

the DOT estimate of the cost.

As a result, any

inflation of winning bids due to collusion would be
completely captured as profits. Of course, successful
collusion may result in fewer lettings in the future.

According to our data, in February 1983,
DOT solicited bids on a contract for resurfacing

Again, the contract was not awarded. The contract was

three bids were submitted. All three firms had bid in
both previous sales. The low bid was about 10 percent
higher than the previous low bid, and about 30 percent
higher than the low bid in the first letting. It is

According to an article published in Newsday,
insiders say leaders of the two most powerful
construction unions on Long Island discouraged outside
bidders by threatening future labor trouble. At least

one of the unions covered the entire metropolitan
area.
Thus, when word spread that particular firms
had "the inside track on large public bids on the
Island and the unions wanted it that way. . .very few
people missed the message."

November 18, 1984, pp. 3, 30.)

the 79 bids on the 25 largest paving jobs, ranging

from approximately $940 thousand to $8 million,
46 percent were submitted by the four largest firms.
In bidding for the larger contracts, a ring would not
have faced much outside competition.
Firms had many opportunities to communicate with

each other. Host bidders were active in the local
trade associations. Joint bidding was also allowed,
provided that multiple bids were not submitted. Some
firms did, in fact, submit joint bids.

Lettings for larger jobs occurred fairly
regularly, early each year.

The regularity of the

lettings may have tended to increase (and make more

predictable) the discounted value of continued
collusion compared to deviation from, and subsequent
expulsion from, any agreement. Although several jobs

were often let on a single day, typically only one
large job was offered on any given day. Spacing the

letting of large jobs may limit the profits that a

defector could earn before other cartel members
retaliated.

Therefore, the timing of lettings may

facilitate collusion.

Finally, firms were relatively homogeneous. All
cartel firms bought variable inputs in the same market

and presumably paid the same factor prices.7

because firms owned different mixes of capital
equipment.

Also, the production process could have

exhibited a deep "U"-shaped short-run average cost
curve.

Therefore, small changes in output may have

induced large changes in average cost.

Short-run

heterogeneities can arise when job backlog affects

average costs for firms that have previously been
awarded contracts. In any event, these are short-run
phenomena and all firms are similar in the long run.
The long-run viability of a cartel is enhanced by this
similarity.

To summarize, the characteristics of this
particular market tend to facilitate collusion. There
is a demonstrated ability of a group of competitors to

coordinate actions (by joint bidding); there are
relatively few bidders on large jobs; characteristics

of the letting process could help cartel members

police collusive arrangements; the DOT short-run
demand elasticity is near zero; the geographic market
is isolated; and barriers to entry seem to exist.
In 1984, one of the five biggest firms in Nassau
and Suffolk Counties was convicted in federal court of

rigging bids on a Long Island highway construction
project. Four other firms were listed as unindicted
12

co-conspirators. All five firms have been named as

participants in bid-rigging schemes in separate
antitrust or racketeering suits filed by New York
State or Suffolk County. In each suit, a single job
was analyzed. No systematic review of other contract
lettings was conducted. This group of five firms may

have been rigging bids on other jobs that were not
analyzed (or have not yet resulted in indictments).

For the purpose of this paper, the five firms
constitute a candidate cartel, potentially operating
in any DOT contract letting. We henceforward refer to
them as "cartel" firms, where the quotations indicate

the tentative nature of the classification.

Other

bidders are henceforward dubbed "competitive." In the
following sections, the cartel firms are individually

referred to as Firms 2, 3, 4, 10 and 14.8

If, in

fact, cartel bids are competitive, then no systematic
differences between the two groups of firms should be
detected.

Notwithstanding the allegations of conspiracy by

the cartel firms, inspection of the data also
indicates that these firms represent a plausible
cartel. The cartel firms submitted 54 percent of the

bids on larger jobs, and were awarded 37 percent of

all contracts. It is at least conceivable that the

Joint bids can be mechanisms for allocating the
market and therefore indicative of bid-rigging. Joint
bidding is illegal unless the specified work could not

be performed without the combined capabilities of the

participating firms, or if the bidders could not be
competitive individually.9 Whether or not the bids in

Table I were legitimate, the cartel fins have a
demonstrated ability and willingness to coordinate
action.

noncompetitive bids are submitted, then a phantom
bidding scheme is being pursued.

Many bid-rigging

practices condemned by the courts have included
phantom bidding.'° Under these schemes, a letting
may appear to be competitive to both the buyer and
noncartel firms.

The possibility of a cartel phantom •bidding
scheme is consistent with our data. The cartel firms
regularly bid "against" each other. Table 2 shows the

number of occasions on which one of the firms in the

group bid against another in lettings of contracts
involving paving. Joint bids were excluded from our
data set.

For example, Table 2 indicates that on the 48
occasions when Firm 2 submitted a bid, 37 bids were

also submitted by Firm 3. At least one firm in the
candidate cartel submitted an individual bid on all
but two of the large jobs in our data. Table 3 shows
the probability of multiple cartel bids on paving and

nonpaving jobs, given that at least one cartel firm
bids on a job. For example, at least one other cartel
firm bid on a paving job 88 percent of the times when

Fin 2 bid. Every time Firm 14 bid on a paving job,
another cartel firm did as well. The probability that

cartel fins bid against each other on nonpaving jobs

is slightly lower, as demonstrated by the lower
percentages reported in the second column of Table 3.

In addition to the evidence from the bidding
data, information obtained from insiders suggests that

a phantom bidding scheme was employed by these fins.
These sources describe the process.

"We all sat at the conference table
one of the contractors would have a list
of upcoming contracts ... they'd talk
about the contract ... how much money
who won the last one ... who should get
this one ... The contractors who were
tagged to be the low bidders would work
out their bid figures ... The rest of the
contractors would then come up with higher

bids ."

Apparently,

the five cartel firms named in the

indictment, together with representatives of two
unions, participated in these meetings. The alleged

role of the union people was to communicate to the
ring members after the meeting what the low bids would

be, and perhaps to help enforce adherence to the
scheme.

For their participation,

the union

representatives allegedly received a kickback of one
percent of the low bid if the job was wonJ2

To summarize, the available evidence suggests

that a phantom or complementary bidding scheme may
have been employed. We assume that the cartel bids
may exhibit the characteristics of a phantom bidding

scheme, rather than some other form of bid-rigging.

We therefore concentrate on detecting this form of
collusion.

Before proceeding, we should also report on two
conventional indicators of the presence of a collusive

scheme. The first is the stability of market shares,

the idea being that a cartel will seek to maintain
stability in an effort to keep participants happy. In
our sample of paving jobs, however, the annual market
of

shares

cartel

firms

exhibited substantial

variability. For example, Firm 10 stopped bidding on

paving jobs early in our sample.

(As indicated in

Table 2, Firm 10 submitted only three bids in our
sample.) The other firms also experienced variable
market shares for paving jobs, as measured either by

number of jobs won or the dollar value of the
contracts.

However, as documented in the Newsday

article, market shares were quite stable for business

on state highway and sewer contracts, including many

jobs not in our sample, for more than a decade.
Therefore, market shares on paving jobs might create

an unwarranted impression of competitive bidding
behavior. Within paving jobs alone, or within general

highway lettings, there is no obvious pattern of

rotation of winning bids to ensure market share
stability.

Second, consider the distribution of cartel and

competitive bids. In our sample of 116 paving jobs,
there were 347 competitive bids on 103 jobs1 and 228
cartel bids on 109 jobs. (All jobs received at least

one bid.)

The bid data are striking in that the

distribution of cartel bids on individual contracts is

more tightly concentrated than is the corresponding
distribution for competitive bids.
18

For example, on

the 76 jobs receiving two or more cartel bids, the
second lowest cartel bid is 4.96 per cent higher than
the low cartel bid.

(This statistic is based on the

average difference between the logarithm of the two

lowest bids.) On the 75 Jobs receiving two or more
competitive bids, the corresponding ratio is 6.25 per

cent. Note that there are more competitive bids per
job, and the two order statistics are closer on jobs

with a higher number of bids, so that the reported
discrepancy understates the differences between the
distributions. This finding is similar to the results

of Feinstein, Block, and Nold (1985) for North
Carolina highway contracts, where noncompetitive
bidding apparently led to clustering of bids, in an
attempt to influence engineer's estimates of the cost

of future lettings. This pattern is also consistent

with an attempt to create the appearance of
competition.

as

job

characteristics and other aspects of the joint
distribution of costs, are assumed to be captured in

a common auction specific constant. We have adopted

this formulation, in which between-fin rather than
between-job differences are emphasized, because this
dimension of our data is more informative. We do not
have useful'job specific information.

Least squares can be applied directly to bid

data to estimate the parameters in equation (2).
Ordinary least squares (OLS) applied to competitive

bid data will give consistent estimates of the
parameters (assuming that sample selection issues can

be ignored, say because all eligible bidders submit
bids). Residuals can then be constructed from the OLS
parameter estimates. The auction-specific variance is

estimated by the auction mean squared residual. A
feasible generalized least squares estimate is then
obtained by using the auction-specific variances to
weight the data.

Firm costs are not observed, so the equilibrium
condition of equation (1) cannot be checked directly.

Nevertheless, abnormalities in cartel bidding can be

detected using the estimated model.

For example,

suspicious behavior may be indicated by behavioral
differences between cartel and competitive bidders.

In particular,

coefficients in equation (2), when estimated from
cartel and competitive bids, may be informative. Of
course, differences in bidding behavior across sets of

firms may be due to unmeasured auction-specific cost
differences, or more general firm characteristics.

Analysis Based on the Ranking of Bids
Detecting bid-rigging directly from bid data is

difficult. As suggested above, abnormalities may be
suggested by the bid data, but no strong conclusion
can be drawn directly from this evidence. By instead

analyzing a fin's expected probability of winning,
the construction of tests for phantom bidding are more

direct and less qualified. From a practical point of

view, fins submitting phantom bids know that a
designated firm will submit a bid lower than their
own.

Complementary bids have no probability of

winning, by design.

These bids may be intended to

create the appearance of competition, or to affect the

buyer's expectations of the costs of future jobs (as
suggested by Feinstein, Block, and Mold (1985)). The

designated low cartel bidder, however, must bid
competitively against any fins outside the cartel.
The designated low cartel bidder and other competitive

bidders must balance the level of a bid with the
probability of winning. Fundamental differences may

then exist between the ordering of competitive and
cartel bids conditional on the observed data; this
difference is the focus of our analysis.
23

Note that we can remain agnostic about how the
low cartel bidder is selected. The designated winner

could be chosen on efficiency grounds, according to
the distribution of costs, or the choice may satisfy

some equity criteria to maintain ring discipline,
according to whose "turn" has come. If the cartel low
bid originates from the low cost firm, then one might

expect the estimated parameters for the low bid
probabilities to be similar for the two groups of
fins. In any event, our rank-based test is designed
to detect differences in the ordering of higher bids,

as opposed to the determinants of the probability of

being the lowest bid, for each set of firms. Unless

the higher cartel bids are competitive, we do not

expect their ordering

observable cost differences.

Equation (3) could be derived directly from
equation (2) if (minus one times) the error term in
equation (2) is distributed as a Type-i extreme value

random variable.1' In that event, the two approaches
are algebraically equivalent.

Parameter estimation proceeds as follows.

First, variances are estimated as above, using
competitive bid data, and the data are deflated using

the estimated auction-specific standard deviations.

The deflated data (times minus one) are denoted Z.

Since this is the likelihood function for data

When the model is correctly specified, the

data. In particular, the likelihood function can be
factored into two independent parts: the likelihood of

observing the low bidders from all auctions and the

likelihood of observing all other rankings of bids

March 1985.

considered.'7

Joint bids are excluded from the

analysis.'8 A total of 575 bids were submitted on
116 projects. Competitive firms submitted 319 bids on

the 75 projects where at least two competitive bids
were submitted.

The jobs receiving one or fewer

competitive bids are dropped from the sample, since an

auction-specific variance is not identified by the
data. The remaining competitive observations are used

directly in the estimation. Cartel firms submitted
157 bids in the 75 auctions considered.

The variables are constructed from data for
these auctions from the DOT "Notice of Tabulation."
Three different data sets are used in the estimation.

The first consists of bid data and the exogenous
variables indicated below.

These data are used to

estimate the parameters using least squares. The
second data set, used to estimate the competitive MNL

model, consists of the same exogenous variables and
the ranking of competitive bids rather than the level

of the bid. The third data set consists of the same
exogenous variables and the rankings of cartel bids.
These data are used to estimate the cartel MNL model.

18

Joint bids represent less than 2 percent of
all bids submitted on contracts involving paving.
28

The exogenous variables include measures of backlog,
capacity, and headquarters location.

Job backlog may contribute to differences in

incremental cost across firms. A fin with a large
backlog of work may face large incremental costs for
an additional job. The variable BACKLOG is defined as

the sum of the dollar values of DOT contracts won but

not yet completed by a particular firm. The jobs are
assumed to be completed in about three months, working

at a constant pace.

In order to capture relatively permanent
differences between firms, a capacity measure CAPS for

fin i is defined to be the maximum BACKLOG carried by

that firm during the sample period.

Hence CAPS —

In order to account for possible

nonlinearities, we include squared capacity, CAPSQ,

and a dummy variable that equals one for non-cartel
firms that never won an auction, NOBACK.

(So NOBACK

Firm backlog at a given time is expressed as a
utilization rate, UTIL, where UTILit — BACKLOGj/CAPj.
(If CAPS — 0, then UTILj — 0 for all t.) Again, to

account for nonlinearities, we include the squared
utilization rate, UTILSQ.
Geographic proximity to a job may lead to a cost
advantage.

For example, the firm with an asphalt

batch plant closest to a paving job would have a cost

advantage over other bidders.

The dummy variable

ISLAND1 equals one if the headquarters of bidder i is
29

on Long Island, and zero otherwise. All cartel firms
were headquartered on Long Island.

Apart from the bids themselves, we were unable
to obtain any job specific data, such as an engineer's

estimate of costs, and so we rely on the auction
specific constants to capture any such differences.

The dependent variable in the least squares
regressions is BIDt, the logarithm of the bid of firm

i on job t, where bids are expressed in hundreds of

thousands of constant 1969 dollars.

The mean

competitive bid was $450,000, while the mean cartel
bid was $713,000.

subsets of data: bids from all firms, bids from
competitive firms, and bids from cartel firms only.
In all three cases, the same auction-specific variance
weights, derived from competitive bids, were employed.
In addition, auction-specific constants are estimated,

but not reported.

If all bids are in fact

competitive, all three estimate the same underlying
parameters. If cartel bids are not competitive, then

the model is misspecified, and only those based on
competitive bids are consistent.

* Absolute values of t-statistics are displayed
in parentheses. Auction-specific constants were
included, but are not reported to save space.
The Wald statistics are for a test of the joint
significance of the reported coefficients. The
coefficients of CAP and CAPSQ are scaled up by
io and 108, respectively.
In general, the competitive model fits well, and

the estimates are of the expected sign. Long Island

firms bid about 3 percent lower than nonresident
firms.

Job backlog and capacity affect bids

significantly. As UTIL increases, bids decrease over
a small range and then increase, other things equal.
31

At a utilization rate of 30 per cent, bids are about
1.5 per cent lower than usual. At full capacity, when

UTIL is one, bids are about 7.5 per cent higher.
Similarly, bids are first a decreasing function of
capacity, and then increasing, with only one firm in

the sample beyond the minimum point. A Wald test of
whether the displayed variables have zero coefficients

yields a test statistic of 494.7, which is distributed

as a chi-square random variable with 6 degrees of
freedom under the null. Thus, the included variables

add significantly to the predictive power of the
competitive model.
The parameters identified by the cartel data are

also reported. Since all cartel firms are from Long
Island, the ISlAND parameter is not identified. The
signs of the coefficients differ for cartel firms and

competitive firms. Many of the cartel estimates do
not have the expected sign.
Of course, if the cartel model is misspecified,

then results using both cartel and competitive data
are potentially biased. A Chow test for equality of
the coefficients estimated using all the data, versus

those obtained front the competitive and cartel data

separately, can be constructed.

Under the null

hypothesis of no bid-rigging, the estimates obtained
from the two subsarnples are identical to those from

the full sample.

The test statistic, which is

distributed as an F random variable with (76, 319)

32

degrees of freedom under the null, equals 9.38. We
can reject the null hypothesis of no bid-rigging.

Based on these results, we are lead to two
conclusions.

First, the model fits the competitive

data reasonably well. Second, bids from cartel firms
statistically differ from those of competitive firms.

The following results suggest the reasons for the
differences between the two types of bids.

Analysis of Competitive Bid Rank Data

The estimates from the MNL model using
competitive data are similar to the results in Table
4.

The competitive MNL estimates are presented in

Table 5.

(Estimated t statistics are included below

the parameter estimates.) Estimates are given using
three different data sets: all ranks, lowest ranks and

higher ranks.

The estimates are stable over ranks.

The likelihood ratio test statistic of coefficient
stability across ranks is 4.3, which is distributed as

a chi-square random variable with six degrees of
freedom under the null hypothesis. The test statistic

is significant at about the 36 percent level, and

depending on whether they are low or not.

VI.

CONCLUSIONS

The idiosyncracies of the DOT auction market
suggest both a candidate cartel and a particular bidrigging mechanism. We find that the ranking of cartel

bids does not coincide with rankings of costs.

We

reject the null hypothesis of no phantom bidding in

cartel data. The bid ranking may not coincide with
cost rankings because of the presence of phantom bids.

In the competitive data, bids increase with costs as

expected, and we cannot reject the hypothesis of no
35

phantom bidding for competitive firms.

Because we

have no reason to believe that the difference between

cartel and competitive bidding is structural, we may
have found evidence of cartel activity.

Our testing procedure may be conservative in
that we may have inadvertently classified some cartel

participants as competitive.

Similarly, we have

access to a relatively sparse set of explanatory
variables. Therefore, it is perhaps best to view the
contribution of this paper as methodological, as well

as descriptive.

Unfortunately, if an antitrust

authority or procurement agency were to publicly
announce the adoption our test procedure, it would be
relatively easy for an effective cartel to tailor its

phantom bids to disguise collusive behavior.

cartel

For

firms could scale their

competitive bids up by the same percentage. The bid
ranking would then coincide with cost rankings.

If

the cartel was not inclusive, differences between
cartel and competitive bidding would be consistent
with cost asymmetries between the two groups of firms.

Presumably, a non-inclusive cartel is profitable when

cartel fins enjoy a cost advantage over competitive
firms. Absent prior information on cost differences,
bidding differences could not be attributed solely to
non-competitive bidding. Attention would then have to

focus on the determination of the identity of the
lowest bidder, or on rates of return.
