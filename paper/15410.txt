Moral Hazard Matters: Measuring Relative Rates of Underinsurance Using Threshold Measures

NBER Working Paper No. 15410
October 2009
JEL No. I10
ABSTRACT
¸
This paper illustrates the impact of moral hazard for estimating relative rates of underinsurance and
to present an adjustment method to correct for this source of bias. Individuals or households are often
classified as underinsured if out-of-pocket spending on medical care relative to income exceeds some
threshold. We show that, without adjustment, this common threshold measure of underinsurance will
underestimate the number with low levels of insurance coverage due to moral hazard. We propose
an adjustment method and apply it to the specific case of estimating the difference in rates of underinsurance
among small- versus large-firm workers with full-year, employer-sponsored insurance. Using data
from the 2005 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we find that after applying the adjustment, the underinsurance
rate of small-firm households increases by approximately 20% with the adjustment for moral hazard
and the difference in underinsurance rates between large firm and small firm households widens substantially.
Adjusting for moral hazard makes a sizeable difference in the estimated prevalence of underinsurance
using a threshold measure.

Introduction
Health care spending in the United States has increased dramatically over the last few

decades -- averaging 3.7% real growth per year from 1995 to 2005 -- and rapid growth is
predicted to continue (Congressional Budget Office, 2008). In response to this growth, many
employers are making changes to their health insurance benefit design to include more costsharing provisions, such as higher deductibles and co-insurance. Because of these trends, there
is growing concern that merely having some form of health insurance is insufficient and that
insured households are becoming less able to afford the cost of their medical care. That is, in
addition to a large number of households not having health insurance, a large number of
households may be “underinsured.”
In order to quantify the number of households that face difficulties in paying for medical
expenses, researchers have defined various measures of underinsurance. Underinsurance is
typically understood as health insurance failing to provide adequate protection against health
care expenditures (for example, see Bashshur et al. (1993)). Several measures of underinsurance
have been adopted since there is no consensus on how to apply this concept to health insurance.
In pioneering work, Farley (1985) and Short and Banthin (1995) defined underinsurance by
combining the risk of a high-expenditure illness and the adequacy of insurance coverage for this
event. Others have defined underinsurance using the size of specific insurance benefits (e.g.,
annual deductible) relative to family income (Schoen et al. (2005)) or the actuarial values of
policies. For example, Gabel et al. (2006) documented that the actuarial value of policies
provided by small firms was less than that of large firms.

The most common underinsurance measure is a threshold measure. A threshold measure
indicates whether a household has spent a certain percentage or more of income on out-of-pocket
health care expenditures (see Shearer (2000), Merlis (2002), Schoen et al. (2005), Collins et al.
(2009), Banthin and Bernard (2006), Ziller et al. (2006), Banthin et al. (2008), Schoen et al.
(2008)). Threshold measures of underinsurance are used because they are easy to compute given
available data and are easy to explain. A commonly used threshold for working-aged
populations is 10% of household income.
Of course, there are normative assumptions built into this measure just as in any
threshold measure of well-being.1 Different thresholds can be applied to different populations,
for example, households in poverty or elderly families. Regardless of the level of threshold used,
or whether the same threshold is applied to all populations, this method for measuring
underinsurance fails to take into account the fact that households with less comprehensive
coverage tend to consume less medical care than they would if they had better insurance, or
alternatively, that generously insured households tend to consume more medical care than they
would if they has less generous insurance.
Economic theory (see Cutler and Zeckhauser (1999)), non-experimental studies (e.g.,
Newhouse and Phelps (1972), Bhattacharya, et al. (1996)), and experimental studies (Manning,
et al. (1987)) all find that health insurance expenditures respond positively to the generosity of
health insurance; this responsiveness is referred to as “moral hazard.”
Any threshold measure of underinsurance is a function of actual expenditures for out-ofpocket health care relative to household income. Coverage generosity affects out-of-pocket

1

For example, the poverty guidelines similarly imply a threshold level of well-being (Federal Register, January 23,
2008, pages 3971-3972).

expenditures in two ways: directly – through co-insurance, deductibles, out-of-pocket spending
limits, etc. – and indirectly – through the effect of moral hazard. The concept of underinsurance
refers to the direct effect: less generous benefit designs will translate into higher out-of-pocket
expenditures for a given level of total spending. However, because of the indirect effect, less
generous insurance also will tend to decrease households’ medical care utilization and
expenditures through a “reverse” moral hazard effect. Therefore, a threshold measure of
underinsurance will underestimate the extent to which households have less generous plans.
Moreover, when comparing the rate of underinsurance across two populations, the one with less
generous coverage will be less likely to have high out-of-pocket spending relative to income than
they would in the absence of a moral hazard effect, causing an underestimate of the difference in
underinsurance between the two groups.
In this paper, we show that a threshold measure of underinsurance typically will not
accurately measure the degree of underinsurance in one population relative to another and
propose an adjusted threshold measure of underinsurance that takes account moral hazard. To
demonstrate this problem and how our proposed adjustment would work, we consider the
specific case of estimating the difference in rates of underinsurance between households who
receive their insurance from small-firms versus large-firms.2 While the adjustment method we
propose would apply to any threshold measure of underinsurance, we use the 10% threshold
measure as our baseline case and test the sensitivity of our results using alternative definitions.
We find that adjusting for moral hazard makes a noticeable difference in relative
underinsurance rates. According to a 10% threshold measure of underinsurance, which does not

Another application of this method would be to a comparison of underinsurance rates between persons with
individual coverage and persons with group coverage.

Abraham, DeLeire, and Royalty

account for moral hazard, the underinsurance rate among households whose policyholder is
employed by a small firm is 90% of that among households whose policyholder is employed by a
large firm. That is, despite substantial evidence that small-firm households tend to have less
generous coverage, these households appear to have relatively lower rates of underinsurance.
We show, however, that this comparison is misleading because of the moral hazard effect. After
adjusting for moral hazard, the underinsurance rate among small firm households is 33% greater
than that among large firm households.
II.

Insurance Generosity in Small and Large Firms
Small firms, when they do offer health insurance, tend to offer less generous insurance

(Gabel et al. 2006). According to data from the 2005 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
(MEPS) Insurance Component List Sample (see Table 1), while there is variation in generosity
within both firm-size groups, on average small firms offer insurance with higher deductibles,
higher copayments, and higher out-of-pocket maximum limits than do larger firms. For
example, deductibles among small-firm plans average almost $800 higher than deductibles
among large-firm plans ($1,875 vs. $1,076). Hospital co-insurance rates average 19% among
small-firm plans and average 17% among large-firm plans; drug co-insurance rates average 40%
among small-firm plans and average 24% among large-firm plans. Similarly, the family
maximum annual out-of-pocket limit averages more than $500 higher among small-firm plans
than among large-firm plans ($5,174 vs. $4,667).
These plan coverage provisions directly affect the out-of-pocket costs incurred by
households. Since small-firm plans tend to provide less generous insurance in terms of
deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance, and annual out-of-pocket limits, one might expect
higher rates underinsurance among small-firm households than among large-firm households.
6

Abraham, DeLeire, and Royalty

In contrast to what one might expect, a higher percentage (5.2%) of large-firm
households are underinsured (using a 10% threshold measure) than of small firm households
(4.7%), according to our analysis, which we describe below. The explanation for this puzzling
result is that moral hazard matters for the measurement of relative rates of underinsurance. That
is, small-firm households reduce their utilization and expenditure in response to the relatively
high cost-sharing they face (as a result of having less generous insurance) though a “reverse”
moral hazard effect. Having less generous insurance leads many small-firm households to
reduce their total medical care spending by enough so that they are not counted as underinsured
by a threshold measure.

III.

The Problem and a Stylized Solution
In this section, we demonstrate the effect of moral hazard on the measurement of

underinsurance with a simple example. We also present a stylized version of the solution we
propose for the calculation of adjusted underinsurance rates that account for this moral hazard
effect. Consider two households, Household X and Household Y, which are identical in all ways
except in terms of plan generosity. As a consequence of moral hazard, Household X (with the
generous health insurance plan) spends more on medical care than Household Y (with the stingy
plan) -- $5,000 versus $3,500 (see Table 2, Panel A). However, due to the differences in plan
generosity, their out-of-pocket expenditures are nearly identical: Household X spends $1,500
out-of-pocket while Household Y spends $1,400 out of pocket. The income for each household
is $15,000, so that Household X spends 10% of its income, out-of-pocket, on medical care while
Household Y spends only 9.3%. If we were to use a 10% threshold measure of underinsurance,
Household X (with the generous plan) would be classified as underinsured while Household Y
7

Abraham, DeLeire, and Royalty

(with the stingy plan) would not be. We will apply our method to small- and large-firm
households but as the example indicates this is a general result for any two populations with
different average levels of generosity of coverage.3
How might one adjust the threshold measure of underinsurance to account for moral
hazard? If we knew how much medical spending Household Y would incur if it had generous
health insurance, we could use the benefit characteristics of Household Y’s actual (stingy) health
insurance plan to determine what their out-of-pocket spending would be, accounting for moral
hazard. We demonstrate how to make such an adjustment in the context of our example (see
Table 2, Panel B). In the example, we use Household X’s spending as an estimate of how much
medical spending Household Y would incur if it had generous health insurance since, by
assumption, Households X and Y are identical except for the generosity of their health plans.
Therefore, Household Y’s expected total medical care spending if it had a generous plan is
$5,000. To determine the amount of out-of-pocket spending Household Y would incur if it spent
as much as Household X, but if it also faced the cost-sharing rate of the stingy plan, we multiply
its expected total spending by its actual average cost-sharing rate.4 To determine the average
cost-sharing rate, recall that Household Y spends $3,500 on medical care and spends $1,400 outof-pocket. Thus, the average cost sharing for Household Y (stingy plan) is 40%
(=$1,400/$3,500). Adjusted out-of-pocket spending for Household Y is, therefore, $2,000
(=0.40*5,000). We propose basing the threshold measure of underinsurance on the ratio of
3

While in our simple example we assume that there are only two plans, one for small firms and one for large firms,
there is, obviously, substantial heterogeneity in plans within both types of firms. Our method does not rely on there
being only one type of plan for each group. Rather it applies to a comparison of two groups whose generosity of
plans differs on average. Our method could also be expanded to include more than two groups.

4

Here we are assuming a constant cost-sharing rate across all spending levels. In our empirical application, we
allow for the cost sharing rate to vary by total spending.

8

Running head: Moral Hazard Matters

Abraham, DeLeire, and Royalty

adjusted out-of-pocket spending to income. In this example, this ratio is 0.133
(=$2,000/$15,000) for Household Y, meaning that this household is underinsured once we
account for moral hazard. If we compare this ratio across the two households, Household Y is
now correctly identified as having less generous coverage and is “more underinsured” than
Household X.
By using the total health care spending of Household X (with the generous plan) in our
calculation of Household Y’s adjusted out-of-pocket spending, we do not mean to imply that a
generous health plan represents the “standard” for optimal health insurance. We could,
alternatively, adjust the out-of-pocket spending of Household X (with generous insurance) by
determining how much medical spending it would have incurred if it had stingy health insurance
(estimated by Household Y’s spending). Since the average cost-sharing rate for Household X is
30%, adjusted out-of-pocket spending for Household X using the less generous plan as the
baseline amounts to $1,050 (=0.30*$3,500) and the ratio of adjusted out-of-pocket spending to
income is 0.07 (=$1,050/$15,000), compared to the ratio of 0.093 for Household Y. Thus, using
either the more generous or the stingy plan as the base case leads to an adjustment that increases
the relative underinsurance rate for the less generously insured household.

Data and Measures

A. Data
We use the 2005 MEPS, Household Component (MEPS-HC) for our analysis. The
MEPS-HC sample is drawn from respondents to the National Health Interview Survey, which is
a nationally representative sample of the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population.

9

Running head: Moral Hazard Matters

Abraham, DeLeire, and Royalty

Our sample is restricted to households that report having employer-sponsored insurance
(ESI) for all members during the entire 2005 calendar year.5 Our definition of a household is
based on a relationship unit constructed to include adults plus family members who typically
would be eligible for dependent coverage under private family plans. We drop households for
which we cannot confirm ESI status or that do not have any active workers (e.g., early retirees or
COBRA enrollees). After removing observations with missing information, we have data on
10,384 individuals in 4,642 unique households (corresponding to 119.6 million individuals
residing in 55.8 million households).
B. Measures
The MEPS-HC contains data on medical care spending, income, employment status,
establishment size, health insurance coverage, human capital and demographic information, and
medical conditions for individuals and households.
Medical Spending: We use information on two types of medical care spending: total and
out-of-pocket. We aggregate individual-level spending across household members to get
household-level out-of-pocket and total medical care spending. We then inflate the measures to
$2007 and re-scale them into thousands of dollars.

5

We do not include households with part-year coverage because it is difficult to distinguish households that are
uninsured for part of the year and underinsured for part of the year from households who are uninsured for part of
the year and “fully” insured for part of the year. Also, we do not include households that have multiple types of
coverage (e.g., ESI for parents, public for children) for a similar reason. These restrictions help to explain why our
estimates of underinsurance rates may differ from other recent studies.

10

Running head: Moral Hazard Matters

Abraham, DeLeire, and Royalty

Income: We use after-tax household income in the denominator of our threshold
measures of underinsurance. Pre-tax household income is aggregated from person-level income
for the calendar year; we use TAXSIM (version 8.6) to estimate after-tax income.
Small-Firm / Large-Firm Household: To designate households that obtain ESI through a
small firm or through a large firm, we first identify the ESI policyholder(s) in the household.
Second, we construct an indicator for whether the policyholder was employed at a small
establishment (50 or fewer workers). Finally, we define small-firm households as those in which
all ESI coverage (whether through one policyholder or two) was obtained through a small
establishment.7
Human Capital and Demographic Measures: In our total spending models, we include a
set of measures to capture demographic and human capital attributes of policyholder(s) in the
household. In households with two policyholders, we use the higher valued outcome. In
particular, we include the age of the policyholder (years), highest education (years), race (white,
black, Asian/Pacific islander, other (reference category))8, whether the household is married, and
number of children in the household who are 17 or under. We also include a set of dummy
variables to capture the income quartile of the household. Since there may be geographic
differences in benefits, labor market conditions, and provider prices, we also include four region
dummies (Northeast, Midwest, South, West (excluded)) and an indicator for whether the
household resides in a metropolitan statistical area to control for these differences.
6

The public-use version of the MEPS does not contain state identifiers. As a result, we were not able to simulate
state income tax burden on households meaning that we overestimate after-tax income, leading to more conservative
estimates of underinsurance.
7

We use “establishment” and “firm” interchangeably. The data measure establishment size.

8

We re-coded multi-race households to reflect the less prevalent race in the population.

11

Running head: Moral Hazard Matters

Abraham, DeLeire, and Royalty

Medical Conditions: We control for a set of serious medical conditions that household
members reported because medical care spending is positively related to the presence of such
medical conditions. Using the Medical Conditions file in the MEPS, we construct a set of
variables corresponding to the number of household members reporting the following: cancer,
diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, heart disease, arthritis, asthma, depression or anxiety,
and back problems.
Table 3 provides variable definitions and summary statistics for the sample of
households. As can be seen, the underinsurance rate (based on the 10% threshold) is lower
among small-firm households than among large-firm households (4.72% vs. 5.23%). Similarly,
there is only a small difference in the underinsurance rate between the two groups – 5.92% vs.
6.01% -- when using a graduated threshold measure of underinsurance. This latter measure
classifies low-income households (< 200% FPL) as underinsured if they spend more than 5% of
after-tax income on medical care and applies the 10% threshold to all other households. These
results are puzzling given the large differences in the characteristics of plans offered by small
and large firms (described in Table 1), highlighting the potential importance of moral hazard.

V.

Method of Adjusting the Underinsurance Measure to Account for Moral Hazard
In this section, we present our method of adjusting for moral hazard when calculating the

relative underinsurance rates between any two populations that differ in the average generosity
of their health insurance. Our method requires five steps, which are described below.
First, we estimate the conditional distribution of total household medical care spending
separately for the sample of large-firm households (that have, on average, more generous plans)
and small-firm households (that have, on average, less generous plans). Specifically, we estimate
12

Running head: Moral Hazard Matters

Abraham, DeLeire, and Royalty

the distribution of spending by estimating quantile regressions at the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th
quantiles.9 We use quantile rather than mean regression because the relationship between
household characteristics and spending varies at different points of the spending distribution. The
variables we condition on include household demographics, human capital, income, medical
conditions, and geographic region.
Second, for each household type, we generate two predicted values of total spending.
The first measure (“predicted”) is predicted total spending using each household’s demographic,
income, medical, and geographic characteristics and the parameter estimates from the quantile
regressions for their own household type (small-firm or large-firm household). The second
measure (“adjusted”) captures what total medical care spending of small-firm (large-firm)
households would have been had they had the more (less) generous health plans. That is, we
predict total spending for each household based on each observation’s characteristics but using
the estimated coefficients from the quantile regressions from the other household type.10 We
thus have four unique distributions of predicted spending: (i) predicted small-firm household
spending based on small-firm household characteristics and coefficients from the small-firm
household models, (ii) adjusted small-firm household spending based on small-firm household
characteristics and coefficients from the large-firm household models, (iii) predicted large-firm
household spending based on large-firm household characteristics and coefficients from the

9

All analyses are estimated using sampling weights. We have tested the sensitivity of our results to estimating these
models at other quantiles and, in our application, the results were robust. It is possible that in other applications the
choice of the set of quantiles could matter.
10

We generate predicted total spending values using each of the five quantile regression models, yielding five
observations per household. The predicted distribution of total spending thus depends on estimates from each of the
quantile regression models as is recommended by Machado and Mata (2005).

13

Running head: Moral Hazard Matters

Abraham, DeLeire, and Royalty

large-firm household models, and (iv) adjusted large-firm household spending based on largefirm household characteristics and coefficients from the small-firm household models.
Since small-firm households tend to have less generous insurance and, as a result, likely
cut back on their spending (due to “reverse” moral hazard), we would expect their adjusted
spending distribution to be shifted to the right (i.e., to yield higher predicted spending levels)
relative to their predicted actual spending.11 Similarly, since large-firm households tend to have
more generous insurance and likely increase their spending due to moral hazard, we would
expect their adjusted spending distribution to be shifted to the left (i.e., to yield lower predicted
spending levels) relative to their predicted actual spending.
While the predicted spending measure does not, of course, capture unobservable
differences between small- and large-firm households, given that we have a rich set of
explanatory variables, including a large set of medical conditions, we believe we have captured
most of the critical characteristics that determine health care spending and which might differ by
firm size. Our predicted spending measures also do not account for adverse selection in the
choice of health plan. Future applications of this method could yield improved estimates of
predicted spending and of adjusted predicted spending with an even more complete set of
controls.
Our third step is to estimate cost-sharing parameters for the small-firm and large-firm
households in our data. Cost sharing differs across the total spending distribution due to
differences in benefit design features such as deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. To
capture this variation, we calculate the average fraction of out-of-pocket spending to total
spending by households’ reported total spending decile (separately for small-firm and large-firm
11

This corresponds to Column (E) of Table 2, Panel B of the stylized example presented in Section III.

14

Running head: Moral Hazard Matters

Abraham, DeLeire, and Royalty

households). Among small firm households, these cost-sharing parameters range from 0.533
among households in the first decile of total spending to 0.166 among households in the tenth
decile. The range is somewhat narrower for large-firm households: 0.379 among households in
the first decile to 0.141 among households in the tenth decile). Each household is assigned the
cost-sharing parameter that corresponds to its firm-size and its decile of predicted total spending.
The fourth step is to compute the expected out-of-pocket medical spending for each
household. To do this, we multiply the value of the household’s predicted and adjusted total
medical spending values by their cost-sharing parameter.
Finally, we calculate the ratio of expected out-of-pocket spending to actual after-tax
income. This ratio is then compared to the threshold relevant to the particular measure of
underinsurance being used. For example, under a 10% threshold measure, if this ratio exceeds
0.10, a household would be classified as underinsured under the adjusted measure.12

VI. Results
We calculate observed rates of underinsurance and, using the method described in the
previous section, rates of underinsurance for small-firm and large-firm households that take into
account the effects of moral hazard. We present two sets of estimates: “predicted” and
“adjusted.”13 Predicted rates are based on households’ predicted out-of-pocket spending relative

12

The ratio corresponds to Column (H) of Table 3 and the underinsurance indicator corresponds to Column (I).

Actual underinsurance rates are presented in Table 3. We cannot compare actual underinsurance rates with
“adjusted” rates because they are not strictly comparable.

15

to their own income; adjusted rates for small-firm (large-firm) households are based on
households’ predicted out-of-pocket spending estimated using large-firm (small-firm) model
parameters as the baseline. We calculate two measures of underinsurance: (1) a straight 10%
threshold and (2) a graduated threshold based on FPL.
Based on their predicted spending, only a slightly larger percentage of small-firm
households are underinsured than are large-firm households, using either the 10% threshold
measure (4.3% versus 3.9%) or the graduated threshold (5.9% versus 5.5%); see Table 4.14
However, because moral hazard leads households with less generous coverage to cut back on
their spending relative to households with more generous coverage, the differences in predicted
underinsurance are misleading.
Adjusting for moral hazard leads to a 5.7% increase in predicted total spending for smallfirm households ($5,813 versus $5,499), consistent with our expectation that these households
respond to their less generous coverage by cutting back on spending.15 Moral hazard also has the
effect of reducing out-of-pocket spending among small-firm households. Adjusting for moral
hazard leads to a 5.3% increase in predicted out-of-pocket spending among small-firm
households.
We also present the effects of this adjustment on underinsurance rates in Table 4. The
result of these adjustments leads to a 21% increase in the underinsurance rate among small-firm
households (using large-firm household spending as a baseline) using the 10% threshold

14

The results from the quantile regressions are presented in Appendix Tables A1-A2.

15

Similarly, adjusting for moral hazard leads to a 5.6% decrease in predicted total spending for large-firm
households ($5,629 versus $5,961), consistent with households’ spending more in response to generous coverage
(results in Appendix Table A3).

16

measure. Adjusting for moral hazard also substantially affects the measure of underinsurance
that uses the graduated threshold, increasing it by 15%.
The effects of moral hazard lead to a highly misleading picture of the difference in
underinsurance rates between small- and large-firm households. The differences in predicted
underinsurance rates between small-firm and large-firm households are very small -- 0.004 based
on either threshold measure. Adjusting for moral hazard, however, leads to a 225% increase in
this difference (from 0.004 to 0.013) when using large-firm spending as the baseline.
Our adjustment methods illustrate that the puzzle of relatively greater underinsurance
rates among large-firm households can be explained by small-firm households’ cutting back on
care in response to their less generous coverage relative to what they would have spent if they
had the more generous coverage enjoyed by large firm workers. Not accounting for the reverse
moral hazard associated with less generous coverage reduces the relative underinsurance rates
among groups with less generous coverage. We also find the corresponding but opposite effect
when examining the issue from the large-firm household’s perspective. That is, underinsurance
rates of large-firm households fall when the effect of moral hazard is taken into account (see
Table A3.)
VII.

Conclusions
Underinsurance, the phenomenon of insured households’ being unable to afford the out-

of-pocket cost of their medical care, is a growing policy concern. In this paper, we show that
moral hazard matters for measures of underinsurance. That is, the fact that people with more
extensive health insurance coverage tend to increase their health care expenditures can impact

17

measures of underinsurance. Adjusting for this moral hazard effect is necessary when estimating
the relative rates of underinsurance across groups. We show that in the absence of this
adjustment, roughly the same percentage of households who obtain their insurance coverage
from a large firm are underinsured as the percentage of households who obtain their insurance
coverage from a small-firm. This result would be puzzling because small firms typically offer
less generous insurance in terms of deductibles, co-insurance rates, and annual out-of-pocket
limits. Adjusting for the effects of moral hazard, we find that our estimate of the percentage of
small-firm households who are underinsured increases substantially — by roughly 20%.
Moreover, the difference in underinsurance rates between small-firm and large-firm households
under our corrected measure is 225% larger than the unadjusted difference.
Our application addresses the measurement of disparities in coverage of small- versus
large-firm workers but the problem, as well as our method to correct it, is more general. Moral
hazard could affect comparisons between any groups with differing levels of coverage
generosity. Our application shows that adjusting for moral hazard can make a substantial
difference in the number of households identified as underinsured and in the relative rates of
underinsurance across groups.

Predicted values of total medical care spending from the quantile regression model of total spending. Predicted for small-firm households uses both small-firm characteristics and
estimated coefficients from small-firm regressions. Predicted for large-firm households uses both large-firm characteristics and estimated coefficients from large-firm regressions.
Predicted out-of-pocket spending uses predicted total spending multiplied by estimated cost-sharing. Estimated cost-sharing is the average fraction of out-of-pocket spending to
total spending by households’ reported total spending decile (separately for small-firm and large-firm households). Predicted underinsurance is based on the ratio of predicted outof-pocket spending to actual income.
2
Adjusted values are predictions of total medical care spending using small-firm household characteristics and estimates from the large-firm quantile regression model.

Predicted values of total medical care spending from the quantile regression model of total spending. Predicted for large-firm households uses both large-firm
characteristics and estimated coefficients from large-firm regressions. Predicted for small-firm households uses both small-firm characteristics and estimated
coefficients from small-firm regressions. Predicted out-of-pocket spending uses predicted total spending multiplied by estimated cost-sharing. Estimated costsharing is the average fraction of out-of-pocket spending to total spending by households’ reported total spending decile (separately for small-firm and large-firm
households). Predicted underinsurance is based on the ratio of predicted out-of-pocket spending to actual income.
2
Adjusted values are predictions of total medical care spending using large-firm household characteristics and estimates from the small-firm quantile regression
model.
