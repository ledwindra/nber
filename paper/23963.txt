ABSTRACT
What are the cumulative effects of health shocks over the life-cycle? The answer depends on the
nature of persistence of bad health and the extent to which it changes individuals' economic
circumstances. We measure the lifetime costs of bad health using a rich structural model that can
reproduce the short-and long-run dynamics of health and health-related inequality in economic
outcomes. We explicitly take into account the fact that this inequality can be partly traced back to
factors predetermined early in life. Our model has several implications concerning the pecuniary
and non-pecuniary effects of health shocks. The life- time costs of bad health are influenced by
ex-ante predetermined factors, and the largest component of pecuniary costs is the loss in labor
earnings. Because bad health lowers ones' life expectancy, its non-pecuniary effects are large. In
particular, through this channel they are very important for individuals' welfare and non-trivially
contribute toward lifetime inequality.

Introduction

How important is health risk over the life-cycle? Bad health can negatively affect individuals through multiple pathways. When markets are incomplete this can translate into
significant disparity in economic outcomes and welfare, especially when bad health is persistent.
Several features of the data suggest that health-related inequality in economic outcomes is
substantial. First, in additon to higher medical spending, unhealthy people have significantly
lower income than healthy people (income-health gradient), due to their lower labor supply
and lower earnings conditional on working. For instance, among prime age men with a high
school degree (ages 45 to 55), participation among the healthy is over 90% while participation
among the unhealthy is around 70%. In addition, conditional on participation the healthy
earn on average 28% more than the unhealthy.1
Second, unhealthy people tend to accumulate substantially less wealth than healthy people (wealth-health gradient). The gap in wealth by health starts at relatively young ages
and becomes very large by retirement time. For instance, among 65 year old males with a
high school degree, the median wealth of the healthy is almost twice that of the unhealthy;
$230,000 for the former versus $120,000 for the latter (in 2015 dollars).2 This suggests that
the accumulated effects of bad health can be important.
In this paper, we develop a structural framework for measuring the long-run effects
of bad health. Our model includes several channels through which bad health can affect
individuals: lower productivity, higher disutility from work and medical expenses, and lower
survival probability. In addition, the association between health and economic outcomes
can be linked to ex-ante heterogeneity across people. Given the goal of our paper, we take
particular care that our model can capture not only the cross-sectional but also short- and
long-run dynamic aspects of the data, specifically those related to (i) the long-term dynamics
of health, and (ii) the joint evolution of health and wealth.
The long-run effects of bad health crucially depend on how persistent bad health is and
where this persistence comes from. The data show that the dynamics of health are complex
and not consistent with a low-order Markov process. More specifically, health transitions
display strong duration dependence in recovery probability: the probability of moving from
bad to good health declines monotonically with the number of years that an individual

after controlling for family sizes. Details are in Section 5.2. See also Smith (1999) who documents the large
disparities in wealth between the healthy and unhealthy in the HRS data; and Poterba et al. (2017) who
show that, in the same data set, individuals’ health status between the ages of 51 and 61 has a significant
impact on the subsequent evolution of their assets.

has been unhealthy. We estimate a parametric model of health shocks that allows for both
history-dependence and fixed ex-ante heterogeneity, and that matches the described patterns.
Both history-dependence and ex-ante heterogeneity can generate persistence in health, but
distinguishing among them allows us to better understand what account for long episodes
of bad health: bad luck or (ex-ante) permanent differences across individuals.
People who draw bad realizations from a persistent health process save less because
they have less net income and face a shorter life expectancy. However, the gap in wealth
between the healthy and the unhealthy far exceeds that implied by the difference in earning,
medical spending, and life expectancy.3 This suggests a systematic difference in saving
propensities between the two groups. To capture this in our life-cycle model, we allow the
aforementioned fixed heterogeneity in health process to be correlated with the rate of time
preferences, i.e., individuals who are predisposed to experience long episodes of bad health
can also be less patient. We estimate this correlation in our structural model using the
Method of Simulated Moments. This can be viewed as the first attempt to merge together
two strands of literature. First is macroeconomic studies that point out the importance
of heterogeneity in rates of time preferences to explain wealth inequality (Carroll et al.,
2016, Hendricks, 2007a, 2007b; Krueger et al., 2016; Krusell and Smith, 1998, Samwick,
1998). Second is a growing microeconomic literature showing the important role of genetic
endowments and childhood circumstances in determining saving behavior (Cronqvist and
Seigel, 2015; Barth et al., 2017) and health outcomes in adulthood (Case et al., 2002, 2005,
2010)
We estimate our model using three datasets: the Health and Retirement Study, the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We focus
on a relatively homogeneous group of high school men to avoid the confounding effect of
education and gender on health and economic outcomes.
Our estimated model is consistent with three sets of important facts. First, it captures
the dynamics of health, including its duration dependence. Second, it matches the observed
impact of bad health on earnings and labor supply (income-health gradient), medical spending, and life expectancy. Finally, and importantly, it also captures the wealth-health gradient
by matching the large difference in wealth levels between the healthy and unhealthy over the
lifespan, and the disparity in wealth changes among people with different number of years
spent being unhealthy.4
3

This was pointed out by Poterba et al. (2010) in a reduced form analysis; we confirm this finding in a
structural framework.
4
The literature commonly documents the wealth-health gradient as a large difference in wealth levels
between healthy and unhealthy individuals after controlling for observables, e.g., age, education, etc. We
add to this an additional dynamic aspect of the gradient: the negative relationship between wealth changes
and the number of years spent being unhealthy.

3

Our results can be summarized as follows. First, both fixed ex-ante heterogeneity and
history-dependence are important in driving health dynamics but they play a different role
in how individuals get sick versus how they recover. More specifically, the persistence of
bad health is mostly generated by fixed ex-ante heterogeneity while the persistence of good
health is mostly due to history-dependence. As a result, long episodes of bad health are
concentrated among individuals with a certain (fixed) health type.
Second, our estimates imply a strong correlation between one’s health type and rate of
time preferences; among the long-term unhealthy a larger fraction is less patient and has a
lower propensity to save. This is important for accounting for the wealth-health gradient:
when the correlation between patience and health type is shut down, the model significantly
underpredicts the wealth gap between the healthy and unhealthy even though it matches
the income-health gradient.
Third, the monetary costs of bad health are very concentrated and highly unequally
distributed across health types. Our measure of these costs includes both direct (out-ofpocket medical spending) and indirect (loss in labor earnings) costs. We find that the latter
component is the largest contributor to the lifetime costs of bad health and arises because
unhealthy individuals are less productive and work less than healthy ones. In addition,
even though total medical costs are substantial for the long-term unhealthy, the effects of
out-of-pocket costs are much smaller due to health insurance coverage.
Fourth, to capture both the monetary and non-monetary effects of health, we evaluate
people’s willingness to pay to increase the probability of being healthy next period. We
find that, overall, individuals are willing to pay about 5% of average income to increase the
probability of being healthy by one percentage point. Our decomposition exercise shows
that good health is valuable mainly because it extends life expectancy and increases labor
earnings. The first channel accounts for 60% and the second for 36% of the computed
willingness to pay.
Finally, we ask how much bad health contributes to lifetime inequality measured as
variation in lifetime utility. We find that bad health can explain up to 47 percent of the
variation in lifetime utilities. The main mechanism behind this result is that the variation in
the length of life due to health shocks creates substantial variation in lifetime utility when
life is valuable. Thus, ignoring this mechanism will significantly underestimate the effect of
health uncertainty on lifetime inequality. This finding compliments the previous studies on
lifetime inequality that mainly focus on the monetary aspect of inequality, thus abstracting
from the non-pecuniary effect of longevity.5
Our study has several contributions. First, we document a number of new facts related
5

to the long-run dynamics of health and use them as additional moments when estimating
our health shock process. Our estimates offer a new insight about the nature of health
persistence and the asymmetric dynamics of healthy and unhealthy states.
Second, we develop a quantitative model specifically designed to gauge the long-run or
accumulated effects of bad health.6 To the best of our knowledge, the accumulated effects of
bad health have not been assessed before due to the lack of data or an appropriate structural
framework.
Third, we use our model to evaluate the effects of health uncertainty from three distinct perspectives: monetary losses, individuals’ valuations, and lifetime inequality. While
previous studies focus on only one of these perspectives, we are able to unite them into
one framework.7 Moreover, our unified framework makes it possible to quantify the relative
importance of various channels through which health affects individuals over the life course.
Forth, even though the negative relationship between health and economic outcomes is
well-documented (see Cutler et al., 2011 for a review), the mechanisms behind it are still
not well-understood. We show that this relationship, both in cross-section and over time,
can be well accounted for in a life-cycle model once taking into account the fact that some
factors determined early in life or at birth can influence both health and economic outcomes
in adulthood. This serves as an important building block toward further analyzing healthrelated inequality through the lens of a structural model.8
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We summarize the data used in our study in
Section 2. Section 3 documents empirical facts related to health dynamics and estimates the
health shock process. Section 4 introduces our life-cycle model and Section 5 describes its
estimation. We present the results and conclusions in Section 6 and Section 7, respectively.
6

A number of studies use a life-cycle model with health uncertainty, but not focusing on its accumulated
effects. For example, Ameriks et al. (2017), De Nardi et al. (2010, 2016), Lockwood (2014), Nakajima
and Telyukova (2011) focus on the role of medical spending after retirement. Cornesa et al. (2018), Kitao
and Jeske (2009), Pashchenko and Porapakkarm (2017) analyze various aspects of health insurance system.
Close to ours are French (2005) who focuses on labor supply and retirement decisions, and Capatina (2005)
who quantifies the effects of health uncertainty on income inequality and precautionary saving.
7
Dobkin et al. (2016), Parro and Pohl (2017), Lundbord et al. (2015), Blundell et al. (2016) show that
health shocks affect earnings or employment while Capatina et al. (2017) study the interaction between
health and human capital accumulation, thus focusing on monetary consequence of health deterioration.
Morphy and Topel (2006), Hall and Jones (2007) emphasize the effects of health on longevity, thus focusing
on its non-monetary aspect.
8
Health-related inequality can also be studied in a structural framework where the evolution of health
is endogenous. This framework has been recently used in a number of studies to examine the effects of
health insurance policies (e.g. Cole et al., 2018; Ozkan, 2014). These studies typically abstract from ex-ante
heterogeneity across individuals that potentially have a long-run effect on health; thus, the disparity in
health outcomes mainly result from realized health shocks and economic circumstances during adulthood.
We propose an alternative structure which takes into account the fact that people are ex-ante different, e.g.
due to genetic endowments and/or childhood circumstances, and this heterogeneity can contribute toward
the joint evolution of health, income, and wealth in adulthood.

Data for the study

The ideal dataset to measure the lifetime effects of bad health is a lifelong panel that
tracks a large number of individuals starting from a young age and until their death and
that contains information on their health, total and out-of-pocket medical spending, health
insurance status, labor earnings, labor supply, and wealth. However, a dataset of this kind
does not exist for the U.S.
To obtain the best possible measurement, we use three different datasets to estimate
our health shock process and our life-cycle model: the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID), the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
(MEPS).
The PSID is a nationally representative panel that surveys individuals and their families.
It started in 1968, on an annual basis, and has been administered bi-annually since 1997.
The PSID tracks individuals over a long period of time but the number of individuals is
relatively small and does not contain information on all of the variables that we need. We
use the PSID to construct the moments for health, labor supply, labor earnings, and wealth
that are the key targets in our model estimation. For health, labor supply, and earnings we
use the 1984-1997 waves because in our model, a period is one year. The PSID collected
wealth information every five years before 1997 and every two years after that. To construct
the wealth moments, we use the 1994 and 1999-2011 waves.
The MEPS is a nationally representative survey of households that focuses on measuring
medical spending and health insurance. It contains individuals of all ages but age is topcoded at age 85 and has a short panel dimension: each individuals is interviewed at most
five times over a two-year period. The medical spending reported in MEPS is cross-checked
with insurers and providers, which improves their accuracy.9 We use waves 1998-2012 of
MEPS to estimate medical spending and parameters related to health insurance.
The HRS is a bi-annual panel that surveys a nationally representative sample of individuals over the age of 50. The advantage of the HRS over the PSID is a larger number of older
individuals. We use the RAND Version O (waves 1994-2012) of this data set to estimate the
health-dependent survival probabilities. In addition, we use the HRS to construct several
additional moments related to health and wealth for the external validation of our estimated
model.
For each dataset, we use a sample of male household heads with education at the high
school level. We normalize all nominal variables to the base year (1996) using the Consumer
Price Index (CPI).

Health dynamics estimation

We first document the cross-sectional and dynamic moments of self-reported health status
of high school males in the PSID data. We then estimate a model for health dynamics that
is consistent with these moments and discuss its implications.
We use self-reported health for two reasons. First, this variable is available in all three
datasets that we use and is consistently measured across them.10 Second, a number of
studies find that self-reported health is highly correlated with other subjective and objective
measures of health and also has significant explanatory power in predicting future mortality,
even after controlling for many other factors (See Idler and Benyamini (1997) for a review,
and van Doorsaler and Gerdtham (2002), and Pijoan-Mas and Rı́os-Rull (2014) for a more
recent examination). In addition, Poterba et al. (2017) use a principle component analysis
to construct a continuous single measure of health index from the HRS and find that the
weights on subjective health measures are relatively high and the highest weight is assigned
to the self-reported health variable.

3.1

Data patterns

We construct our measure of health as follows. In the PSID (and the HRS), individuals
are asked to rank their health as excellent, very good , good , fair or poor.11 We aggregate
these answers into a binary measure of health: individuals who report their health to be in
the first three categories are classified as healthy or in good health, while individuals who
report being in fair or poor health are classified as unhealthy or in bad health.12
The top panel of Figure (1) displays the percentage of unhealthy individuals by five-year
age brackets. The dots correspond to the statistics constructed from the PSID while the
crosses refer to the statistics from the HRS. The percentage of unhealthy individuals over
the age of 50 computed from the HRS is similar to that computed from the PSID. The bottom
panel of Figure (1) displays the health transition probabilities between two consecutive years
by five-year age bracket.13 These figures show that conditional on survival, as people age,
they are more likely to become unhealthy and less likely to recover from bad health.
10

The top panel of Figure 1 shows that for individuals over 50, which is the age group observed in both
PSID and HRS, the measure of self-reported health is consistent in these two datasets. Attanasio et al.
(2011) compare this variable in the HRS and MEPS, and document that the two datasets are consistent.
11
There are 2,368 individuals without missing self-reported health status in the PSID, or 19,503 individualyear observations. On average individuals are observed for 8 consecutive years.
12
This classification is common in the literature. See, for example, French (2005), Capatina (2015), Rust
and Phelan (1997).
13
These transition probabilities were constructed as follows. Denote health status of individual i at age
t as hit . For a group of individuals aged 20 to 24, the probability of moving to good health conditional on
currently being in bad health can be expressed as

To better understand the dynamics of health, we next analyze how the transition probabilities to good and bad health depend on the duration of the current health status. Specifically, we compute the transition probability of moving to good (bad) health conditional on
being in bad (good) health for at least τ consecutive years.14 Due to the small sample size
we group observations into three larger age groups: 30-54, 55-69, and older than 70. Figure

(2) plots (in shaded bars) the resulting duration-dependent transition probabilities from bad
to good health (top panel) and from good to bad health (bottom panel).
A key feature of the probability of recovering from bad health is that it declines monotonically with duration: the longer an individual has been unhealthy, the less likely he is to
become healthy, and this pattern holds for all age groups.15 It is important to note that this
decline cannot be captured by the low-order Markov process for health that is commonly
used in the literature (e.g., French, 2005; French and Jones, 2011; and Capatina, 2015).
For example, a first order Markov process implies that the transition probability does not
depend on how long one has been in bad health, while a second order Markov process would
imply that this probability is the same for durations longer or equal to two years. In the
next section, we discuss how this observation motivates our parametrization of the health
process.
In contrast to the transition from bad to good health, the transition from good to bad
health does not display noticeable duration dependence, especially at younger ages, as can
be seen in the bottom panel of Figure (2). More specifically, there is a noticeable difference
between the probability of moving into bad health after having been healthy for at least one
and two years, but after that the probability profile is rather flat. In other words, individuals
who are healthy for two years have almost the same probability of becoming sick compared
to individuals who are healthy for more than two years. This lack of duration dependence
suggests that the probability of becoming sick can be well described by a low-order Markov
process.

3.2

Health process specification and estimation

The negative duration dependence in the probability of recovering from bad health shown
in the top panel of Figure (2) can be generated by two different mechanisms. First, the effects
of bad health can be compounding, i.e., individuals who stay sick for a long period of time
might have a smaller recovery probability than those who are sick for a short period of time.

This negative duration dependence is a robust pattern even when we exclude those ever receiving
Social Security Disability Insurance or when we use smaller age groups, for example, based on a 10-year age
bracket. As an additional robustness check, we also compute the transition probability from bad to good
health, where we include in the bad health category only people who report their health being fair, thus
excluding individuals with poor health (the worst self-reported health status) who are less likely to recover.
The declining pattern still holds when using this more homogeneous measure of bad health.

Figure 2: Dynamics of health conditional on duration.

This mechanism is consistent with a high-order Markov process. Second, individuals may
differ in terms of their ability to recover, i.e., some individuals have lower recovery probability
than others. In the latter case, people who are more likely to recover move out of the bad
health state faster, hence the pool of the long-term unhealthy is predominantly composed
of individuals who are inherently less likely to recover. The latter mechanism is consistent
with fixed heterogeneity in health transition probabilities.
We choose our model for health dynamics based on two criteria. First, the model must
capture the cross-sectional and dynamic moments of health that we document. Second, the
model must be parsimonious, so that a structural life-cycle model augmented with this health
shock process is computationally manageable. Based on these criteria, we formulate our
health shock process as a second-order Markov process with fixed heterogeneity. Specifically,
the probability of being in good health at age t + 1 conditional on surviving to age t + 1
and being in bad health for τB years, denoted πitG (τB ), is formulated as the following logit
function:

 
 

logit πitG (τB ) = a1 1 (τB = 1) + a2 1 (τB ≥ 2) + b1 t + b2 t2 + ηi .

10

(1)

The first bracket is a second-order Markov process, the second bracket is a second-degree
polynomial in age, and ηi is the fixed heterogeneity or health type.16 We assume that ηi is
uniformly distributed over five discrete points that are symmetric around zero, i.e., there
are five distinct health types. Note that an individual with low ηi has a lower probability of
recovering.
In a similar fashion, we model the probability of being in bad health at age t+1 conditional
on surviving to age t + 1 and being in good health for τG years, denoted πitB (τG ), as follows:

 
 

logit πitB (τG ) = a3 1 (τG = 1) + a4 1 (τG ≥ 2) + b3 t + b4 t2 + b5 ηi .

(2)

We allow the health type to have a different effect on the probabilities of getting sick and
recovering by introducing the coefficient b5 in Equation (2). It should be noted that our
specification nests the first-order Markov model of health shock commonly used in the existing literature; this requires the following restrictions on the coefficients: a1 = a2 , a3 = a4 ,
and ηi = 0.
We use the Method of Simulated Moments to estimate our health shock process and target
the moments documented in Figures (1) and (2). The transition probabilities in Equations
(1) and (2) and the targeted moments are conditional on surviving from age t to t + 1; so we
first estimate the health-dependent survival probabilities by age. Since the sample size of the
elderly in the PSID is small, we use the data on males with a high school degree from the HRS
(1994-2012) to estimate a probit model of two-year survival probabilities as a function of a
cubic polynomial of age interacted with the dummy variable of the current health status.17
The one-year survival probability is computed as the square root of the estimated two-year
survival probability. Since the sample in the HRS is older than 50, we use our estimated
probit model to predict the survival probability for the younger age groups. Figure 3 shows
our estimated one-year survival probabilities conditional on the current health status.
Given our estimated survival probabilities and parameter values θH = {a1−4 , b1−5 , η1−5 }
for Equations (1)-(2), we can simulate the realized health status over the life-cycle for a large
number of individuals. The initial distribution of health status is taken from a sample of
people age 19-22 in the PSID, where we assume that the initial health status is orthogonal
16

The proposed specification is similar to a proportional hazard model commonly used in survival models,
where the first bracket is a baseline hazard function.
17
We do not allow one’s health type to affect one’s survival probability directly, but there is an indirect
effect through the evolution of health. If we were to allow for a direct effect, our estimated life-cycle model
would imply that one’s’wealth could predict his immediate survival probability, even after controlling for
his current health status. This happens because our model implies a strong correlation between wealth and
health type (as will be discussed in more details in Section 5.2.2). This is not true in the data: Pijoan-Mas
and Rı́os-Rull (2014) find using the HRS that after controlling for the current self-assessed health, the effects
of education, wealth, and income on the next two-year mortality rate are very small.

H and MH are the vectors of the targeted moments from the PSID and the simulated data, respectively. The targeted moments in our estimation are listed below.

• The percentage of unhealthy individuals in each five-year age group, as shown in the
top panel of Figure (1) (12 moments).
• The health transition probabilities between two consecutive years for each five-year age
group, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure (1) (24 moments).
• The duration-dependent profiles of the transition probabilities, as shown in Figure (2)
(36 moments).
The identification of θH is straightforward, given the relatively simple specification of our
health shock process. The percentage of unhealthy individuals and the age-dependent transition probabilities in Figure (1) help pin down the age-dependent coefficients {b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 }.
As discussed in the previous subsection, our Markov process of order two implies a constant
transition probability after being in bad (good) health for two years or longer. Thus, {ηi }5i=1
18

This assumption is innocuous since the majority (96%) of individuals are healthy at this age. Most
people become unhealthy later on, after receiving a health shock.

We first do a grid search over the possible values of θH , and then use the simplex method to find the
minimum using the parameters obtained from the grid search as our initial guess.

and b5 are identified from the transition probabilities over the durations longer than two
years, as plotted in Figure (2).20 Finally, the coefficients {a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 } are used to capture
the difference in the transition probabilities between those in bad (or good) health for at
least one year vs. two years. The solid lines in Figure (1) and white bars in Figure (2)
show that our parsimonious model of health captures both the cross-sectional and dynamic
moments of health over the life-cycle relatively well.

3.3

Estimation results

The implications of our estimated health process are illustrated in Figure (4). The left
(right) panel of the figure plots the probability of moving from bad to good (good to bad)
health conditional on one’s fixed health type and duration of the current health status (bad
and good, respectively). Comparing the two panels reveals a striking difference in what
generates persistence of good and bad health. The left panel shows that fixed heterogeneity
has a large impact on the probability of recovering from bad health. For example, a 60year-old individual of health type η1 (the “worst” type), who is in bad health, has about
a 5% probability of recovering, while a 60-year-old individual of type η5 (the “best” type)
has about an 80% probability of recovering. At the same time, once fixed heterogeneity is
controlled for, duration dependence plays little role: individuals who spend one year being
unhealthy have almost the same probability of recovering as individuals who spend more than
two years being unhealthy conditional on being of the same health type (see the comparison
of the dashed and solid lines for each health type).21
The right panel of Figure (4) shows that in contrast to the probability of recovering from
bad health, the probability of becoming sick is influenced very little by health type: what
plays an important role in this case is duration dependence. For example, a 60-year-old
individual who has been healthy for two or more years has less than a 10% probability of
becoming unhealthy while an individual of the same age who just recovered (has been healthy
for only one year) has close to a 50% probability of relapsing back into bad health.
For an external validation of our estimated health process, we turn to the HRS and select
a sample of healthy males with a high-school degree, age 55-56, and whom we can observe in
every survey year until they are 65-66. This leaves us with 828 individuals in the balanced
panel data. We then compute the distribution of the number of unhealthy periods that these
individuals report over the next ten years. Since the HRS is a bi-annual survey, an individual
can only report being unhealthy for at most five periods. We then construct a comparable
20

Since we assume that ηi is symmetric around zero, we estimate only {η1 , η2 }.
We also estimated an alternative model where the second-order Markov processes in Equations (1)-(2)
are replaced with third-order Markov processes. The estimations are not much different from Figure (4) and
the probabilities of recovering from bad health still depend mostly on health types.

What accounts for the long spells of bad health?

Using our estimated model, we can construct the lifetime distribution of unhealthy years
over the working period. The left panel of Figure (6) plots the distribution of individuals
by the total number of years that they have spent being unhealthy between ages 20 and 64,

14

conditional on being alive at age 64. Most people are relatively healthy during their working
life: 72% of individuals experience fewer than 5 years of bad health. However, a non-trivial
number of individuals spend more than a third of their working period being unhealthy.
For instance, 6% of individuals experience 16 or more years in bad health. The right panel
of Figure (6) illustrates how this distribution differs across health types by comparing two
extreme groups: individuals born with the best health type (η5 ) and those born with the
worst health types (η1 and η2 ). Among individuals with η5 type, 91% spend fewer than 5
years being unhealthy and almost none of them experiences more than 11 unhealthy years.
In contrast, among η1 - and η2 -type individuals, 21% endure between 11 and 20 unhealthy
years, and 8% are unhealthy for 20 years or longer. Thus, long spells of bad health are
primary concentrated among individuals with the worst health types. In other words, long
spells of bad health are mostly due to fixed heterogeneity rather than repeated draws of bad
realizations from a persistent stochastic process.

How should the health type be interpreted?

As our previous discussion shows, the health type (η) plays an important role in the
persistence of bad health: our specification allows for the possibility that people have different
abilities to cope with illness, and our estimation shows that this heterogeneity is substantial.22
22

Halliday (2008) uses the PSID to estimate a dynamic model of health status with fixed heterogeneity
and heterogeneous persistent coefficients. He finds that for a large part of his sample, persistence is mostly
driven by fixed heterogeneity. Lange and McKee (2012) estimate a dynamic latent health model using
multiple health measures available in the HRS. They also find that heterogeneity across individuals (random
effects) is important in capturing the high persistence of objective and self-reported health measures.

15

Individuals can recover differently from sickness due to the variation in genetic predisposition and/or lifestyle, where the latter can be partly due to habits developed in childhood.
In addition, a number of studies find that childhood circumstances can have a long lasting
effect on adult health. To look for evidence supporting these mechanisms we resort to the
HRS, which has a large sample size and more detailed information on individuals’ characteristics. We use the same sample of individuals used to construct Figure (5); that is, a
balanced panel of healthy individuals aged 55-56 and whom we observe until they are 65-66.

4-5 periods being unhealthy are 501, 69, and 27, respectively.

Table 1 sorts the HRS sample based on the total number of unhealthy periods that they
report over the ten-year interval. An interesting observation is that there is a correlation
between the future number of unhealthy periods and factors that can be linked to lifestyle
recorded at age 55-56 or genetics. In particular, individuals who report being unhealthy for
four to five periods between ages 57-58 and 65-66, are much more likely to smoke, to have a
higher body mass index (BMI), and less likely to have living parents.
The next correlation worth noting is between the number of unhealthy periods and
parental education: individuals with longer unhealthy spells have less educated parents.
This is consistent with the findings of Case et al. (2002) who show that parental income
and education have a significant impact on child’s health and thus on the subsequent health
evolution during adulthood.
16

Overall, Table 1 shows that even in a relatively homogeneous sample of healthy males
(aged 55-56) with the same educational attainment there is heterogeneity in some fixed
or long-lasting factors, which in turn are correlated with their health evolution during the
next ten years. These features of the data are consistent with our stylized model of health
dynamics: the last column of Table 1 shows that in a comparable sample simulated from
our model, 71% of individuals who experience 4-5 unhealthy periods have the worst health
types (η1 ,η2 ).
In Table 2 we further document the relationship between the number of unhealthy periods (our proxy for health types) and behavioral genetic variables recently found to be a
robust predictor of economic outcomes. Specifically, Barth et al. (2017) find that wealth at
retirement is positively associated with the Polygenic scores for educational attainment and
negatively associated with the Polygenic scores for smoking and BMI (after controlling for
education, labor income, and other observables). These scores are indices created by combining various genetic markers that robustly predict individuals’ educational attainment,
smoking behavior, and BMI. The scores are normalized to have mean of zero and variance
of one. A higher score predicts a higher education level, a higher propensity to be a smoker,
and a higher BMI, respectively.23 Table 2 reports the average scores of the same HRS sample
as in Table 1 sorted by the number of unhealthy periods. Notice that individuals reporting
4-5 unhealthy periods between the ages of 57-58 and 65-66, on average, have a noticeably
lower score for educational attainment and higher scores for smoking and BMI comparing
with those who report at most one unhealthy period. Appendix A shows that this finding is
robust when we compare the 25th , 50th , and 75th percentiles of the scores distribution. This
suggests that, to a certain extent, the wealth-health gradient can be traced back to factors
determined early in life. We formalize this mechanism in the next section when we discuss
our model.

Our life-cycle model

In this section, we construct a life-cycle model with health uncertainty, where health
affects individuals through multiple channels and evolves according to the process described
in the previous section.

4.1

Demographics, preferences, and labor income

A model period is one year and each individual lives at most T periods. During the first
R − 1 periods of life an individual chooses whether to work or not. At age R all individuals
23

17

retire. We denote the health-dependent survival probability from age t to t + 1 as ζth (this
probability is plotted in Figure 3).
At age t an agent’s health, ht , can be either good (ht = 1) or bad (ht = 0). Health evolves
according to the process defined in Equations (1) and (2), i.e., one’s current health status
depends on one’s health status in the previous two periods and health type ηi ∈ {η1 , ..., η5 }.
Health and economic outcomes in our model are linked via two mechanism. First, health
directly affects medical spending, productivity, disutility from work, access to health insurance, and survival probabilities.24
Second, individuals differ in their rates of time preferences which, in turn, can be correlated with their health type.25 This correlation captures the fact that some factors determined early in life can influence both health and economic outcomes. The mechanism creates
a compositional difference between the healthy and unhealthy; among the latter there can
be more impatient people, thus partially accounting for the observed disparity in economic
outcomes between the two groups.
Formally, we assume that individuals’ discount factor (βi ) can take two values, βi ∈
{βlow , βhigh }, where βlow < βhigh . At age 20 (when an individual enters the model) the
joint distribution of {βi , ηi } is captured by P r(βj |ηm ) ∈ [0, 1], where j ∈ {low, high} and
m ∈ {1, ..., 5} .
An individual is endowed with one unit of time that can be used for either leisure or
work. Labor supply (lt ) is thus indivisible; lt ∈ {0, 1}. Work implies a fixed utility cost φW
for healthy individuals and φW + φB for unhealthy ones. We assume that the preferences of
individuals over consumption and leisure take the following form:26
(ct /nt )1−ρ
− φW 1{lt >0} − φB 1{ht =0,lt >0} + b,
u(ct , lt , ht ) =
1−ρ
24

(4)

These direct effects have been used in other structural models with health uncertainty, e.g., Capatina
(2015), French (2005), French and Jones (2011), Pashchenko and Porapakkarm (2013, 2016a, 2017), Rust
and Phelan (1997).
25
Individuals’ heterogeneity in the rates of time preferences is supported by empirical studies, e.g., Epper
et al. (2018), Lawrance (1991), Warner and Pleeter (2001). In addition, Cronqvist and Siegel (2015) find
that genetic differences explain a significant fraction of the variation in saving propensities across individuals,
potentially through its link to the rate of time preferences or self-control.
26
In our model, health affects utility by increasing disutility from work but does not affect the marginal
utility of consumption. Theoretically, the health-dependent marginal utility can help explain the wealthhealth gradient. Specifically, if the marginal utility of consumption is significantly higher in the unhealthy
state, the precautionary saving among the healthy will be higher. We find that the quantitative effect of
this mechanism is small because the probability of falling sick among working-age people who are healthy
for at least two years is rather small. (See Figure 4.) We also tried estimating an alternative model where
the marginal utility of consumption in the unhealthy state is increased by 30%. This modification does not
affect our estimated parameters, including the correlation between βi and ηi . In addition, the effect of health
deterioration on marginal utility is inconclusive. (For a brief review, see Finkelstein et al., 2009).

18

where 1{.} is an indicator function which is equal to one if its argument is true and zero
otherwise, ρ is risk-aversion, and nt is an age-specific household size. We follow Hall and
Jones (2007) by adding a positive term b to ensure that individuals in our model value their
life; i.e., the continuation value of being alive exceeds the utility when deceased. This is
important because otherwise individuals would welcome higher mortality that comes from
worsening health. As explained in Section 5.2.2, we calibrate b to match the empirical
statistical value of life.
Individuals also have bequest motives and derive utility from leaving a bequest of size k
as follows:
(k + kBeq )1−ρ
,
θBeq
1−ρ
where θBeq determines the strength of the bequest motive and kBeq is a parameter shifter
that determines to what extent bequests are a luxury good. In this approach we follow De
Nardi (2004).
The earnings of individuals are equal to zth lt , where zth is an idiosyncratic productivity
component that takes the following form:
zth = λht Υt .

(5)

Here λht is a deterministic function of age and health, while Υt is the stochastic shock that
we specify in Section 5.1.5.

4.2

Medical expenditures and health insurance


During each period every agent receives a medical expenditure shock xht which depends
on age and health. We denote the distribution of medical shocks as Gt (xht |ht ).
A working-age individual receives an offer to buy employer-sponsored health insurance
(ESHI) with probability P robt , which depends on age (t), productivity (zth ), and health (ht ).
The variable gth,z characterizes the status of the offer: gth,z = 1 if an individual gets an offer,
and gth,z = 0 otherwise. Only working individuals with an offer (lt = 1, gth,z = 1) can purchase
the ESHI insurance. We assume that an employer who offers ESHI fully covers the premium,
i.e., the employer contribution is 100%.27 In addition, every working-age individual can buy
health insurance in the individual health insurance market. The price of health insurance
in the individual market depends on one’s age and health. We denote the individual market
27

On average, employers who offer ESHI contribute around 80% of the premium for single coverage and
around 70% for family coverage (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2004); we abstract from workers’s contribution
for simplicity, this assumption does not affect our results but helps to lower the computational costs since
working individuals with an ESHI offer always buy insurance.

19

price as pI (ht , t). All retired individuals are covered by public health insurance, Medicare.
We denote the Medicare premium as PM CR .
We index the insurance status of an individual by using iH : iH = 0 corresponds to
being uninsured, iH = 1 corresponds to individual insurance, iH = 2 corresponds to group
(or ESHI) insurance, and iH = 3 corresponds to Medicare. All types of insurance only

provide partial medical expenses coverage. We denote by cvg xht , iH the fraction of medical
expenditures covered by insurance which is a function of the medical shock and insurance

type. Note that cvg xht , 0 = 0.

4.3

Taxation and social transfers

All individuals pay an income tax T (yt ) that consists of two parts: a progressive tax
and a proportional tax. Taxable income yt includes labor and capital income. Working
households also pay payroll taxes, which include the Medicare tax (τM CR ) and the Social
Security tax (τss ). The Social Security tax rate for earnings above y ss is zero. Consumption
is taxed at a proportional rate of τc .
We also assume a public safety-net program, T SI (c). This program guarantees every
household a minimum consumption level c, which is a simple way to represent several
means-tested programs in the U.S., such as Medicaid, food stamps, and Supplement Security Income. In addition, the consumption floor captures the existence of uncompensated
care or medical bankruptcy.28
Retirees receive Social Security benefits ss. In practice, these payments depend on an
individual’s history of earnings. To reduce computational costs, however, we allow ss to
depend only on one’s health type ηi and fixed productivity type, which is part of the productivity Υt (see Section 5.1.5). Since the labor supply decisions of individuals over the life-cycle
are affected by fixed productivity and health types, this approach allows us to capture the
resulting heterogeneity in pension benefits without introducing an additional state variable.

4.4

Timing of the model

The timing of the model is as follows. At the beginning of the period, individuals learn
their productivity, health and ESHI offer status. Based on this information, an individual
decides his labor supply (lt ) and insurance choice (iH ). At the end of the period, the
medical expenses shock (xht ) is realized. After paying the out-of-pocket medical expenses, an
individual chooses his consumption (ct ) and savings for the next period (kt+1 ). The problem
of retirees is simpler; they only choose consumption and savings for the next period.
28

In 2004, 85 percent of the uncompensated care was paid by the government.

To make our expression less clustered, we omit the subscript i for all state variables. Also, to simplify

The term ξ h is a proportional load, while ϕh is a fixed load. We allow the loads to depend on
health to capture the fact that unhealthy individuals may face more frictions when purchasing insurance through the individual market, for example, through search costs or a larger
probability of being denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions. The expected medical

Model parameters estimation

In this section, we explain our strategy to estimate the model parameters and exogenous
shocks. The information related to earnings, labor supply, and wealth is taken from the
PSID, while the information about medical expenses, health insurance coverage, and ESHI
status is taken from the MEPS.31
We adopt a two-step estimation strategy. In the first step, we set parameters related to
demographics, taxes, social security benefits, and health insurance and estimate the shock
processes directly from the data. In the second step, we estimate the remaining parameters
using our structural model to match the targeted moments from the data.

5.1

First step estimation/calibration

In the following, we describe parameters and the shock processes set/estimated during
the first step. The survival probability and health shock process are taken from Section 3.3.
5.1.1

Demographics

An individual enters the model at the age of 20, retires at age 65 and lives at most until
the age of 99. The age-dependent family size nt is the average family size from the PSID.
The average family size is 1.8 at age 20 and gradually increases to its largest size (3.2) at
age 38. At retirement, the average family size is 2.1. We set the risk aversion ρ to 3, which
is within the range of 1 to 5 commonly used in macro and structural life-cycle models.
5.1.2

Taxes and social security benefits

In specifying the tax function T (y) we use a combination of the nonlinear functional
form formulated by Gouveia and Strauss (1994), and a linear income tax τy :


T (y) = aτ 0 y − (y −aτ 1 + aτ 2 )−1/aτ 1 + τy y.
The first term captures the progressive income tax; in this functional form, aτ 0 controls
the marginal tax rate faced by the highest income group, aτ 1 determines the curvature of
marginal taxes, and aτ 2 is a scaling parameter. Following Gouveia and Strauss (1994) we set
31

A household unit in the MEPS includes all members who would be covered under a typical family
health insurance plan. We use the sample of household heads with a high school education, where household
heads are males with the highest earnings. The MEPS has five rounds of interviews over two years. In each
round, individuals are asked to rank their health as excellent, very good , good , fair , or poor , similar to the
PSID and HRS. We classify an individual as healthy in a certain year if his self-reported health falls in the
first three categories for at least two rounds in that year.

23

aτ 0 and aτ 1 to 0.258 and 0.768, respectively. The parameters aτ 2 and τy are set to 0.6160 and
0.066 percent, respectively, following Pashchenko and Porapakkarm (2017). The Medicare,
Social Security and consumption tax rates were set to 2.9 percent, 12.4 percent and 5.67
percent, respectively. Using the social security rule in 1996, the maximum taxable income
for Social Security (y ss ) is set to $62,700.
To compute the Social Security pension payments ss, we use the Social Security benefit
formula in 1996 and apply it to the average labor income over working ages. Specifically,
we first group individuals in our model based on their health types and fixed productivity
defined in Section 5.1.5. Then for each group the average labor income over working ages is
defined as the average labor income over the 35 highest-earning years.
5.1.3

The medical expenses shock

The medical costs in our model correspond to total paid medical expenditures in the
MEPS dataset. The medical expense shock is approximated by a 3-state discrete healthand age-dependent stochastic process. To capture the highly skewed distribution of medical
expenses, for each age and health status, these three states correspond to the average medical
expenses of three groups: those with medical expenses below the 50th , 50th -97th , and above
the 97th percentiles, respectively.32 More details on the estimation of our medical shock
process are provided in Appendix B.
5.1.4

Health insurance and ESHI offer probability

We define a person as having employer-based insurance in the MEPS if he reports having
ESHI for at least eight months of the year. The same criterion is used when defining a
person as having individual insurance.33 Due to the small sample size of those with individual insurance, we assume that ESHI and individual insurance provide the same coverage;


cvg xht , 1 = cvg xht , 2 . We combine information on individuals insured by ESHI and individual insurance to estimate the fraction of medical expenses covered by these insurance

policies. We report these estimates in Appendix B. For retired households, we set cvg xht , 3
to 0.5 following Attanasio et al. (2011).
32

The MEPS tends to underestimate aggregate medical expenditures (Pashchenko and Porapakkarm,
2016b). To bring aggregate medical expenses computed from the MEPS in line with the corresponding
statistics in the National Health Expenditure Account (NHEA), the estimated medical expenses were multiplied by 1.60 for people younger than 65 years old and by 1.90 for people 65 or older. These numbers
correspond to the ratio of aggregate medical spending in the NHEA divided by aggregate medical spending
in the MEPS for people younger and older than 65 years old, respectively, averaged over the years 2002,
2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010 (the years when the NHEA provides the aggregate statistics by age).
33
If a person reports having both ESHI and individual insurance in one year and each coverage lasts for
eight months or less but the total duration of coverage lasts for more than eight months, we classify this
person as individually insured.

24

We assume that individuals receive an ESHI offer with probability P robi , which is estimated from the following logit regression:34
logit (ESHIit ) =

ESHIit is one if individual i is insured through ESHI, otherwise it is zero; inc
income normalized by the average income of the same year and ESHIit−1 is ESHI status in
the previous year. We include income in the regression to capture the positive relationship
between labor income and ESHI coverage as observed in the data. In the MEPS, unhealthy
individuals have a noticeably lower ESHI coverage even after controlling for labor income.
To capture this we allow the ESHI offer probability to be different between the healthy and
unhealthy. For the initial distribution at age 20, we run a separate logit regression among
individuals aged 19-22 without including ESHIit−1 in the regression specification.
For individual insurance premiums we use the estimates from Pashchenko and Porapakkarm (2017) and set the fixed load ϕh at zero for the healthy and $790 for the unhealthy.
The proportional load ξ h is 1.079 for the healthy and 1.135 for the unhealthy.
5.1.5

The labor productivity shock

We specify labor productivity in our model as follows:
zth = λht Υt = λht exp(νt ) exp(γ),

(18)

νt = ρν νt−1 + εt ; εt ∼ N (0, σε2 ),

(19)

γ ∼ N (0, σγ2 ),
where λht is a deterministic component that depends on age and health. The idiosyncratic
component Υt consists of a persistent shock νt and fixed productivity γ.
We use the PSID to estimate the parameters determining the evolution of zth . First we
compute labor income, defined as earnings plus income from business (converted into 1996
dollars). Given that an individual in our model makes a discrete labor supply choice, we
define a worker as a person younger than 65 who earns at least $2,470 per year in base year
dollars (this corresponds to working at least 10 hours per week and earning a minimum wage
of $4.75 per hour). The crossed marks in Figure 7 show the fraction of workers (left panel)
34
We use only individuals who earn more than $2,470 per year in base year dollars. Note that we use
the ESHI status as opposed to ESHI offer status in our logit regression. Since everyone in our model always
buys employer-based insurance if offered, there is no difference between being insured through ESHI and
receiving an ESHI offer in our model. In the MEPS, 95% of individuals who receive an ESHI offer take it.

25

and the average labor income conditional on working (right panel) by health status from the
PSID. For all age groups, unhealthy individuals work much less and, conditional on working,
earn significantly less than healthy individuals.
Because the fraction of unhealthy workers is significantly below 100%, average income
if there is selection into employconditional on working could be a biased estimate of λh=B
t
ment. To account for the potential selection problem, we estimate the parameters of λht
inside the model in the second step.35

approximations using a third degree polynomials of age. The solid lines are from our model.

We estimate the stochastic component Υt in the first step using the sample of working
individuals.36 We have 1,036 working individuals and 10,778 individual-year observations.
Our estimation strategy closely follows that of French (2005). First, we run the following
fixed effect regression:

where incit is labor income and Dt is a set of year dummy variables. By construction, the
residual uit is orthogonal to health and age. Thus, it is the empirical counterpart of the
35

An alternative method is to apply the two-step Heckman estimation directly to the data. However, this
approach requires a valid variable serving as an exclusion restriction. Though more computationally costly,
our strategy ensures that the model reproduces the income-health gradient in the data (Figure 7 and Table
6), which is important for evaluating the cost of bad health through the labor market channel.
36
Note that the parameters in Equation (19) are assumed to be independent of health status and age.
Since most workers are healthy and over 90% of healthy people work, we are less concerned about the
selection problem when estimating the parameters of Υt directly from the data. An alternative approach is
to use only the sample of healthy workers younger than 50, but this would reduce our sample size.

26

AR(1) component in Equation (19).
Next, we construct the empirical autocovariance matrix using the residuals (γi + uit ). We
estimate the parameters of the productivity shock by minimizing the distance between the
empirical autocovariance matrix and the corresponding matrix implied by Equation (19).37
Our resulting estimates are as follows: ρν = 0.9275, σε2 = 0.021, and σγ2 = 0.042, which
are within the range of values estimated in the literature. In our computation we discretize
the shock processes using nine gridpoints for νt and three gridpoints for γ. Our grid for νt
expands with age to capture the observed cross-sectional variance that increases with age.
We adopt the method in Floden (2008) for our discretization since it performs well for highly
persistent processes, such as our AR(1) process.

5.2

Second step estimation

Given the parameters and the shock processes from the first step, we implement the
Method of Simulated Moments to estimate the remaining parameters in our model, i.e., we
minimize the distance between the targeted and simulated moments. Below we describe the
two sets of moments that we explicitly target.
First set of moments. To capture the effects of health through the labor market
channel and to replicate the income-health gradient, we target the fraction of workers and
the average labor income conditional on working among the healthy and unhealthy for each
age-group (Figure 7).38 These moments are used to pin down the disutility from work {φW ,
φB } and the health-dependent productivity profile λht .
Second set of moments. The lifetime costs of bad health depend on how well individuals are insured against labor income and medical expense risks. Because saving is
an important instrument to insure against these risks, it is important that our model can
reproduce the wealth distribution by health status. To capture the wealth-health gradient,
we target the 25th , 50th , and 75th percentiles of wealth, conditional on health status by age,
between the ages of 30 and 85 (dashed lines in Figure 8). We discard the wealth moments
below age 30 because we assume that individuals enter the model with zero assets. These
moments are informative about the preference parameters {βlow/high , P r (βlow |ηi ) , θBeq , kBeq }
and the consumption floor c.
To construct our targeted wealth profiles, we use net worth from the PSID (1994, 19992013).39 Because net worth is measured at the household level and our model abstracts from
37

This is a standard procedure commonly used in the literature. See for example, Storesletten et al.
(2004) and French (2005).
38
In our estimation, we smooth the targeted average labor income profile conditional on working by the
fitted third degree polynomials of age (dashed lines in the left panel of Figure 7).
39
Specifically, net worth is derived from the value of business/farm, checking/saving accounts, real estate,

(20)

t=1994

j=0,1

where wealthit is net worth, Ditage and Dt are age and year dummy variables, and nit is the
number of individuals in a family unit. Given the estimated coefficients and the residuals
resit , we replace nit in the above equation with the average family size at each age, nage ,
to get our measure of net worth.40 Then we construct the targeted 25th , 50th , and 75th
percentiles of wealth distribution by health status and report them as dashed lines in the
left panels of Figure 8. As a comparison, we also apply the same method to net worth in
the HRS (1994-2012) and plot the results as crossed marks in the left panels of Figure 8.
The wealth profiles from the two datasets are remarkably similar. Figure 8 displays the
wealth-health gradient typically documented in the literature: the right-hand-side panels of
the figure emphasize this gradient by plotting the gap in wealth between the healthy and
unhealthy. This gap starts at relatively young ages and widens until retirement age. This
feature of the data suggests that it is important to model the entire life-cycle to understand
the costs of bad health.
5.2.1

The estimation algorithm

Our estimation strategy exploits the fact that in our model there are two mechanisms
generating a gap in accumulated wealth between the healthy and unhealthy. First, due to the
high out-of-pocket medical expenses and low earnings, unhealthy individuals have limited
resources to save. Second, a larger fraction of the unhealthy might have a lower discount
factor (βlow ) and thus choose to save less. The basic idea in our estimation strategy is to
sequentially isolate these two mechanisms. First, we ensure that the resources available to
the unhealthy in our model are comparable to those in the data by capturing the important differences in labor market outcomes in Figure 7. Second, our algorithm adjusts the
composition of individuals with βlow among the healthy and unhealthy until our model replicates the wealth-health gradient in Figure 8.41 Appendix C formally explains our estimation
stock, vehicles, other assets, annuity/IRA accounts, and home equity net of the value of mortgages/debts.

are the estimated coefficients and the residuals from Equation (20). By construction, we remove the variation

Similar strategies are implemented in Erosa and Kambourov (2016), French (2005), Kaplan (2012) and
Pashchenko and Porapakkarm (2013, 2017).

algorithm.
Our estimation strategy is to highlight that a life-cycle model with endogenous labor
supply can well match the income-health gradient but significantly underpredicts the wealthhealth gradient. And the compositional difference between the healthy and unhealthy plays
an important role in explaining the wealth-health gradient. In Section 5.3 below we illustrate this by reestimating an alternative model with no compositional difference between
29

the healthy and unhealthy (no correlation between η and β). This alternative model can
reproduce only 40% of the difference in median wealth between health status even though it
matches the income-health gradient precisely.
5.2.2

Second step estimation results

Figure 7 compares the employment rate (left panel) and the average labor income of
workers (right panel) generated by our model (solid lines) with the targeted profiles from
the PSID (crossed marks). Our model matches the important differences in labor market
outcomes between the healthy and the unhealthy very well. Section 5.4 shows that our model
also matches the observation that the lower-income group contains a much larger fraction of
unhealthy people.
The left panel of Figure 8 displays the wealth profiles from our model (solid line) and
the data (dashed line for the PSID and crossed marks for the HRS). Our model succeeds
in matching the wealth gap between healthy and unhealthy people for the 25th , 50th , and
75th percentiles. Note that even though all individuals in our model start with zero assets,
the simulated profiles also track very well the widening wealth-health gradient starting from
younger ages, as illustrated in the right panel of the figure. Since the monetary costs of
bad health (low earnings and high medical spending) among the young are relatively small
comparing to older groups, the wealth gradient for the younger group is mostly explained
by the larger fraction of βlow -individuals among the unhealthy.

Table 3: Preference parameters and the consumption floor.

The third column of Table 3 reports our estimated preference parameters and consumption floor. The discount factors play an important role in wealth accumulation before retirement and its distribution; our estimated βlow and βhigh are 0.904 and 0.995, respectively.
The correlation between the discount factor and health type is identified by matching the
wealth levels of the healthy and unhealthy people, conditional on reproducing the observed
30

labor market outcomes by health status. We find a strong correlation between one’s discount
factor and health type: the fraction of impatient individuals (βlow ) among those with the
worst health types (η1 , η2 ) is 80%, while among those with the best health type (η5 ) it is
only 12%. The unconditional average of the discount factor in our model E(β) is 0.944.
The estimated bequest parameters θBeq and kBeq , which mostly affect wealth decumulation after retirement, are equal to be 4,464 and 246,371, respectively. In a one-period
consumption-saving model with a risk aversion of 3, these values imply that the bequest
motive becomes operational at an asset level of $15,000 and the marginal propensity to
bequeath (MPB) is 0.94. In other words, individuals with assets below $15,000 would not
leave bequests, while individuals with assets above $15,000 would leave 94 cents out of every
additional dollar for bequests. These numbers are within the range of values found in other
studies.42
The consumption floor, which mostly affects the savings of the lower-income group, is
estimated to be $3,593. This is consistent with estimates obtained within the context of other
structural models featuring the full life-cycle, medical spending uncertainty, and endogenous
labor supply.43
Finally, because the scaling constant b in Equation (4) enters the utility function additively we can calibrate it after the second step estimation by targeting the empirical statistical
value of life (SVL). The measure of the SVL emerged from the literature on compensating
differentials for risky occupations. It is based on the compensation individuals are willing
to accept in exchange for an increase in the probability of death expressed as “dollars per
death”. For example, suppose people are willing to tolerate an additional fatality risk of
1/10, 000 for a compensation of $200 per person. Among 10,000 people in this situation
there will be one death and it will cost the society 10, 000 × $200 = $2 million, which is thus
the implied SVL.
To calibrate b we decrease the survival probability among working-age individuals by
1/10,000 and compute a compensation that makes them indifferent between this counterfactual case and the baseline. The SVL implied by our model is the average compensation
among working-age individuals multiplied by 10,000. The targeted SVL in the baseline
model is $2 millions which is the lower end of the range estimated in the literature44 ; Viscusi
(1993) provided an extensive review documenting that the estimates vary from $1 million to
42

For example, the estimation in De Nardi et al. (2010) implies a bequest threshold of about $36,000
and a MPB of 0.88. Pashchenko (2013) provides a comparison of the MPBs and bequest thresholds across
several structural life-cycle studies.
43
Capatina’s (2015) estimate of the consumption floor is $4,114 (in 2006 USD) while Pashchenko and
Porapakkarm’s (2017) estimate is $1,540 (in 2003 USD).
44
Our calibrated b also implies that all agents prefer living to dying. Specifically, the continuation value

31

$16 millions (in 1990 dollars).45
Overall, the SVL affects the relative importance of pecuniary and non-pecuniary effects
of health over the life-cycle. For example, when the SVL is small, only the monetary effects
matter. In contrast, when the SVL is high, the non-pecuniary effects become more important
because health affects life expectancy and, consequently, lifetime utility. In our baseline
calibration we set the targeted SVL to the lower end of the empirical estimates; thus we are
estimating a lower bound of the non-pecuniary effects of health. As discussed below, our
results show that even under this parameterization the non-pecuniary effects of health are
very important. In Appendix E we report the results from an alternative parameterization
when the SVL is equal to $6 millions, which emphasizes the non-pecuniary effects of health
more.

5.3

Compositional differences and the wealth-health gradient

As shown in the previous subsection, the results of our estimation imply a non-trivial
compositional difference between the healthy and unhealthy due to the estimated correlation
between health type and the rate of time preferences. To illustrate the importance of this
compositional difference, we re-estimate an alternative model where we restrict P r(βj |ηm ) =
0.5 for all m and j. We call it the “no-correlation” model. In this case, one’s discount factor
is orthogonal to one’s health type and, consequently, to health status. The “no-correlation”
model still features all of the channels through which bad health can affect individuals’
savings.
Because the “no-correlation” model has no explicit parameters to separately capture
the wealth profile of the healthy and unhealthy in our estimation, we replace the targeted

specifically, the 25th , 50th , and 75th percentile of wealth for each age between 30 and 85.46
We report the estimated parameters for the “no-correlation” model in the last column
of Table 3. These parameters turn out to be similar to those in the baseline, including the
rates of time preferences (βlow , βhigh ). In addition, the model-simulated data can match the

We have tried to target the wealth moments conditional on health but since we do not have parameters
to match them the results were very similar to those when we target the unconditional moments.

targeted wealth quartiles unconditional on health status. The second and fourth columns of
Table 4 compare the 25th , 50th , and 75th wealth percentiles for the 60-64 age group in the
PSID (and HRS) and in the “no-correlation” model, respectively. As a reference, we also
report the corresponding statistics from the baseline model. The “no-correlation” model also
matches the employment rate and the average labor income by health status conditional on
working (the income-health gradient).
The “no-correlation” model, however, falls short of replicating the observed large differences in wealth by health status, as shown in Table 5. For example, the difference between
the median wealth of the healthy and unhealthy near retirement is only $40k in this model
compared to about $100k in the data (and baseline model).
We conclude from these findings that the direct effect of bad health (low earnings, high
out-of-pocket medical expenses and shorter life expectancy) only partially accounts for the
observed difference in accumulated wealth between the healthy and unhealthy.47 This also
means that the income-health gradient does not imply the wealth-health gradient. It should
be noted that the wealth gap arising from the compositional difference is large even though
we focus on a relatively homogeneous group of males with the same education level. In
Appendix D we discuss additional aspects of the data on wealth and health, and how the
composition difference can help account for them.
47

Using the HRS, Poterba et al. (2017) construct a continuous health index for individuals aged 51-61
in 1992 and document that there is a large difference in asset growth between those in the top and bottom
one-third of the health index. They also find that only 20-40% of the difference in asset growth can be
attributed to the lower earnings and annuity income of those in poor health.

Model fit with respect to aspects of the data not targeted

In this section, we evaluate how well our baseline model performs along additional dimensions related to the health gradient which are not targeted in our estimation. Specifically,
we ask whether it can replicate (i) the distribution of individuals by health conditional on
income and wealth, and (ii) the joint dynamics of wealth and health. Capturing these aspects of the data is important to properly evaluate the long-term effects of bad health and
the contribution of health to lifetime inequality
The first three columns of Tables 6 and 7 display the percentage of unhealthy people by
income and wealth terciles. In the data, conditioning by age group, there are much more
unhealthy people in the lowest terciles of earnings and wealth. Our model matches these
additional features of the data well.
Next we check whether our baseline model can capture the joint dynamics of health and
wealth for several years before retirement. To do this, we first document the relationship
between wealth changes and the number of periods that individuals spend being unhealthy
between ages 55-56 and 65-66 from the HRS. We use individuals who are healthy at age 55-56
and are observed every two years until they are 65-66 (this is the same balanced sample that
we used to construct Figure 5 and Table 1). For each individual we compute the change in
his wealth between ages 55-56 and 65-66. The crossed marks in Figure 9 plot the median
wealth change conditional on the number of periods spent unhealthy between ages 57-58 and
65-66.
The data show that, among people who do not report being unhealthy in any period,
median wealth increases by about $50k over the ten-year period, while among individuals
with the highest number of unhealthy periods (5) median wealth declines by about $10k. The
dotted marks in the figure show the corresponding statistics from our model and demonstrate
that our model is successful at replicating the almost linear negative relationship between
median wealth change and number of unhealthy periods during the 10 years before the
retirement. It is worth noting that our estimation only targets cross-sectional moments of
the wealth-health gradient; yet, our model can closely match the long-run dynamic aspect
of this gradient. This gives us additional confidence that the estimated model is a good
framework to evaluate the long-run effects of bad health.

Results

In our framework, bad health hurts individuals in a number of ways: it affects their
earnings, medical spending, and life expectancy. The first two channels entail pecuniary
losses while the third one lowers lifetime utility when individuals value their life. In this

section, we evaluate both the pecuniary and non-pecuniary effects of bad health over the
life-cycle.
To measure the loss in available resources, we start by constructing a comprehensive
measure of the lifetime costs of bad health which includes both direct (medical spending)
and indirect (labor earnings) losses. Next, we ask two questions to gauge the non-pecuniary
effects of health. First, how much are individuals willing to pay to improve the probability
of being in good health, and why? Second, how much does health uncertainty contribute to
lifetime inequality?

6.1

Measuring the costs of bad health

In our model, the monetary costs of bad health arise from exogenous health-dependent
stochastic processes (productivity, medical shock, and ESHI offer probability) and from behavioral responses (labor supply, insurance purchase, and savings). By summing these costs,
we can get the measure of accumulated losses due to bad health an individual experiences
over the working stage of the life-cycle.
Conceptually, to understand how costly it is for an individual to be unhealthy over his life
course, we want to measure how much better off he would be in a counterfactual situation
where his health is always good but everything else is the same. Our structural framework
allows us to construct this counterfactual situation. In particular, we consider the following
experiment. We place each individual in an environment where he unexpectedly draws good
health realizations every period (becomes exceptionally lucky) while the realizations of other
shocks over his life course are the same as in the baseline. Note that this approach has an
advantage over estimating the costs of bad health directly from the data. In the latter case,
we can only compare different individuals, healthy and unhealthy ones, after controlling for
observables. As we showed earlier, healthy and unhealthy individuals differ in unobservables
(health type and preferences) and this can bias the empirical estimates of the costs of bad
health.
To formalize our approach, denote the earnings, net of total medical spending, of individual i at time t in the baseline and counterfactual cases as yit and yitH , respectively. The
difference between yit and yitH represents the pecuniary costs of bad health in period t. Our
measure of the lifetime costs of bad health averages these costs over the working stage of the
life-cycle for those that survive to age 64 in the baseline economy:
64

1 X H
yit − yit .
lossi =
45 t=20

By focusing on individuals who survive to age 64 we ensure that our measure of the costs of
bad health is not affected by mortality bias. For example, some unhealthy individuals may
have low accumulated losses due to bad health because they die early.
Table 8 displays the lifetime costs of bad health by the number of years spent being
unhealthy between ages 20 and 64. This table conveys several interesting findings. First,
the costs of bad health quickly increase with the number of years spent being unhealthy. For
example, an individual who spends between 1 and 5 years being unhealthy loses, on average,
$652 per year between ages 20 and 64. In contrast, an individual who spends between 16
and 20 years being unhealthy loses nearly $5,000 per year, or 13.5% of the average annual

earnings in our model.
Second, the largest component of these costs is the loss in earnings: on average, they
account for 57% of the lifetime costs of bad health. For relatively healthy individuals (1 to
5 unhealthy years) it constitutes around 60% of total costs, while for those with the longest
periods of sickness (more than 20 years) it is 51%.
Third, about 43% of the lifetime costs of bad health come from medical spending and
approximately half of these are covered by insurance. Health insurance coverage turns out to
increase with the number of unhealthy years: health insurance covers only 12% of the total
lifetime costs of bad health for people who experience less than 5 unhealthy years, while this
number is close to 30% for individuals with more than 16 unhealthy years.
Because individuals who experience long spells of bad health are much more likely to be
of bad health types, the costs of bad health are unequally distributed across types. Table
9 shows that the average losses for η5 -individuals (the best health type) are about $500 per
year between ages 20 and 64, while the average losses for η1 -individuals (the worst type) are
37

about $2,500 per year, which represents 6.8% of average labor income in our model.
Another important finding is that the distribution of lifetime costs of bad health is highly
concentrated (see Table 10): 20% of people with the highest lifetime costs due to bad health
account for 71% of aggregate lifetime costs, while the top 5% account for 28%. Interestingly,
even when the costs covered by health insurance are excluded from this measure, the concentration of costs remains high. Thus, even though health insurance plays an important
role for people with very high lifetime costs, it does little to reduce the concentration of the
total costs.
Overall, two important conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in this section. First, the lifetime costs of bad health can be very high and individuals are ex-ante
different in their probability of ending up in the top end of the distribution; those born with
bad health type have significantly higher costs over their life-cycle. Second, studies that
confine the effects of bad health only to medical expenses can significantly underestimate
the total losses that unhealthy people experience over their working lives.

6.2

Measuring the value of good health

We now turn to a more comprehensive measure of the costs of bad health, which takes
into account that bad health also affects one’s welfare by lowering his life expectancy, thus
incorporating its non-pecuniary effect. Specifically, we consider the effects of health using
individuals’ valuation.
We start by computing working-age individuals’ willingness to pay to increase their probability of being healthy next period by one percentage point. We assume that this change
in health dynamics is temporary: it applies only to the probability of being in good health
next period and after that the health transition probability returns to the status quo.
Table 11 displays the results of this experiment using the baseline economy. On average,
working-age individuals are willing to pay $1,903 to increase their probability of being healthy
next period, or 5.3% of average income in our model. There is considerable variation in the
willingness to pay by health type: individuals with the worst health type (η1 ) are willing to
pay more than double of those with the best health type (η5 ); $2,933 for the former vs $1,200
for the latter. Because the unhealthy state is much more persistent among individuals with
bad health types, they are willing to pay more to decrease the probability of becoming sick.
Another important observation from Table 11 is that, within a particular health type,
asset-rich individuals are willing to pay much more than asset-poor ones. The ratio of
the willingness to pay between the top and bottom asset terciles is ranging from 2.1 for
η1 -individuals to 2.8 for η5 -individuals. The higher willingness to pay of the rich can be
explained by two forces. First, given their lower marginal utility of current consumption

Second, better health lengthens one’s lifespan and the rich can enjoy the additional years of
life more since they can secure a higher consumption flow.48
Next, to separate the non-pecuniary effects from the monetary ones, we measure how

39

much individuals are willing to pay for the improved health dynamics when the effects of
health are limited to only one channel; namely, life expectancy, labor market outcomes,
or medical spending. To do this we consider three counterfactual experiments. In the
first experiment, we assume that bad health only affects one’s survival probability, i.e.,
individuals who become sick experience a decline in their life expectancy but no change in
their productivity, disutility from work or medical spending. In the second experiment, we
assume that bad health only affects one’s productivity and disutility from work, i.e., there
is no effect on life expectancy or medical spending. In the third experiment, we assume that
bad health only affects one’s medical spending. Note that in the last experiment, health
affects not only the distribution of total medical costs but also insurance premiums in the
individual market and the probability of getting ESHI. In each of these three experiments,
we reevaluate how much individuals in the baseline economy are willing to pay to increase
the probability of being healthy next period by one percentage point.49
Table 12 displays the results of these experiments expressed as a percentage of the willingness to pay in the baseline economy.50 The results imply that the most valuable aspect
of being healthy is having a longer life expectancy: the second row of Table 12 shows that
when bad health only affects longevity the willingness to pay to improve health dynamics
constitutes 60% of the baseline level. As for the monetary effects of health, consistent with
the results in the previous subsection, the labor market channel is significantly more important than the medical spending channel. The willingness to pay when only the former
channel exists amounts to 36% of the baseline level, compared to just 5% when only the
latter channel exists.
There is variation in the relative importance of pecuniary vs non-pecuniary effects by
health types (columns 3 to 7 of Table 12). For better health types, the life expectancy
channel is far more important than the monetary channel. This variation is driven by the
fact that η5 - and η4 -individuals tend to have more assets. Table 13 shows that individuals
with high assets mostly care about the longevity aspect of good health, while those with low
assets put a large weight on the earning aspect. This is because rich individuals, on average,
are better insured against the monetary consequences of bad health; they also enjoy longer
lives more since they can afford to consume more per period.51
49

In these three experiments, bad health affects individuals through only one channel from the next period
onward while the effect of bad health in the current period is the same as in the baseline. This ensures that
each individual has the same amount of resources and faces the same immediate survival probability (from
the current period to the next) as in the baseline, so that the dollar value of the willingness to pay in each
counterfactual experiment is comparable to this value in the baseline economy.
50
Our decomposition exercise is not supposed to sum to 100% by construction. The purpose of this
exercise is to rank the importance of each channel through which health affects individuals.
51
This pattern holds even when we look into the same age group.

6.3

Health and lifetime inequality

Our previous results show that the lifetime pecuniary costs of bad health can be very
high but what dominates people’s valuations of good health are its non-pecuniary benefits.
In this section we ask how much bad health affects lifetime inequality.
To capture both the pecuniary and non-pecuniary aspects of good health, we evaluate
lifetime inequality by comparing the variation in lifetime utility in our baseline economy and
in the counterfactual economy where everyone always (unexpectedly) draws good health
realization while still receives all other shocks as in the baseline.52
Let denote the lifetime utility of an individual i in the baseline economy as:

Denote V ar(Ui ) as the variance of lifetime utility in the baseline. Denote the lifetime utility in
the counterfactual case as UiH and its variance as V ar(UiH ). The share of lifetime inequality
due to health uncertainty is the percentage reduction in V ar(Ui ) compared to V ar(UiH ):

(21)

The results of this exercise are shown in the second and third columns of Table 14. Since
our inequality measure depends on the rate of time preferences, we report the calculation
separately for individuals with βlow and βhigh .
Once removing bad health realizations, lifetime inequality is significantly lower: the
percentage decline ranges from 14% of the baseline case among the βhigh -types to 47% among
the βlow -types. In addition, for both groups, the effect of health uncertainty on inequality is
larger among individuals with worse health types (η1 , η2 ) compared to the effect on better
health types (η3 , η4 , η5 ). As shown in Figure 6, a non-trivial fraction of η1 - and η2 -individuals
endures multiple unhealthy years; consequently, there is larger variation in monetary losses
and lifespans within this group. Once bad health realizations are removed, the variation in
their lifetime utility decreases more.
Health uncertainty affects lifetime inequality through two channels. First, it increases
the variation in lifetime resources, which affects consumption and leisure. Second, it raises
the variation in lifespans, which directly affects utility. Figure 10 shows the distribution of
the age of death in the baseline and the counterfactual economy where everyone is always
52

In the counterfactual economy, some people will live longer once we remove bad health realizations.
During their extended life, they are always healthy and draw their labor productivity, medical expense, ESHI
offer, and survival probability from the corresponding shock processes.

healthy. The distribution in the counterfactual case shifts toward the maximum lifespan, 99
years old, and becomes less dispersed. The median age of death shifts up from age 77 in the
baseline to age 82 in the counterfactual economy.
To separate the two channels, we simulate an additional counterfactual experiment in
which everyone is always healthy but individuals’ age of death is fixed as in the baseline.
The percentage reduction in the baseline variance of lifetime utility is reported in the last
two columns of Table 14. A striking difference from the previous experiment is that the
variance decreases much less: only by 4% of the baseline for the βhigh group and 24% for
the βlow group. Thus, the large portion of the decline in lifetime inequality reported in the
second and third columns of the same table comes from the lower variation in the age of
death.
Overall, our results in this section show that the contribution of bad health to lifetime
inequality is substantial. Consistent with our findings in Section 6.2 an important mechanism
through which health uncertainty maps into lifetime inequality is by changing the length of
42

life (survival channel). Thus, focusing only on the monetary losses will underestimate the
lifetime inequality due to bad health by half or more.

Conclusion

In this paper we develop a structural framework for measuring the lifetime consequences
of bad health. We first estimate a model of health dynamics using a rich set of data moments
and allowing for history-dependence and fixed heterogeneity. We find that fixed heterogeneity
is important to account for the persistence of bad health. We then incorporate this estimated
health process into a life-cycle model with incomplete markets. The estimated model can
replicate important facts related to health and economic outcomes, including the incomehealth and wealth-health gradients. We show that the wealth-health gradient does not
naturally follow from the income-health gradient and the fact that the unhealthy have higher
medical spending and lower life expectancy. The large gap in wealth by health is also driven
by the compositional difference between the healthy and unhealthy; specifically, on average,
the latter group includes more people with a lower propensity to save.
We use our estimated model to quantify the pecuniary and non-pecuniary effects of bad
health over the life-cycle. We find that the monetary costs of bad health quickly accumulate
as working-age individuals spend more years being unhealthy and the largest component
of these costs is the loss in labor earnings, while the contribution of out-of-pocket medical
spending is much smaller. However, when taking into account the non-monetary aspect
of health, the most detrimental consequence of being unhealthy is lower life expectancy
as evidenced by two findings. First, individuals are willing to pay a substantial amount
to access technology that increases their chance to be healthy; 60% of the willingness to
pay is attributed to the fact that good health can extend life expectancy. Second, we
find that health uncertainty can account for a substantial share of lifetime inequality even
among individuals within the same educational group, largely by affecting the variation in
individuals’ lifespans.
Overall, we show that a life-cycle model can account for many cross-sectional and dynamic
aspects of socioeconomic status-health gradient when taking into account the correlation between predetermined factors affecting health outcomes and preferences underlying economic
decisions. Our structural framework can serve as an important building block for further
examining issues in health-related inequality. The growing body of studies about early
childhood interventions and the recent advancements in the use of genetic information in
economic research allow us to better understand the importance of childhood circumstances
and genetic endowments in shaping health and economic outcomes in adulthood. Incor-

43

porating these mechanisms into a structural framework will be a valuable tool to address
many important policy questions. For example, to what extent early childhood interventions
can reduce health-related inequality or, more broadly, the intergenerational persistence of
lifetime inequality.

Polygenic scores and health outcomes in HRS

Here we use the same HRS sample as in Table 2 and report the 25th , 50th , and 75th
percentiles of the three Polygenic scores among individuals reporting different unhealthy periods. Consistent to the average scores in Table 2, among individuals reporting 4-5 unhealthy
periods all percentiles of the scores for educational attainment are noticeable lower while all
percentiles of the scores for smoking and BMI are higher than the corresponding percentiles
of those reporting at most one unhealthy period.

Medical shocks and insurance coverage

To estimate medical expenses, we follow Pashchenko and Porapkkarm (2017). First the
medical expenses in the MEPS are converted into 1996 price using the CPI, then, we separate
our sample into 12 age groups (20-24, 25-29, 30-34, ..., 75+). We assign the age of each group
to the mid-point of the corresponding age interval. For example, 22 for 20-24, 27 for 25-29,
32 for 30-34, etc. For each year, we divide medical expenditures into 3 bins corresponding
to the bottom 50th, 50-95th, and top 5th percentiles for each health status and age group.
To obtain a value of medical expenses in each bin, we run a regression of medical expenses
on a set of age group and year dummies. The coefficients on age dummies in this regression
are the average medical expenses for the corresponding age and health in a particular bin.
The resulting numbers are multiplied by 1.60 for people younger than 65 years old and by
1.90 for people who are 65 or older to make medical spending in our model consistent with

49

the aggregate medical spending in the NHEA as explained in Section 5.1.3. Then, we fit our
estimated coefficients with a quadratic function of age. Figure (11) shows the medical costs
for each grid separately for healthy and unhealthy individuals.

To determine the fraction of medical expenses covered by private insurance cvg(xht , iH )
where iH ∈ {1, 2}, we do the following. We estimate medical expenditures paid by private
insurers as a function of total medical expenditures and year dummy variables using only
individuals who are categorized as individually insured or group-insured. Then, we convert
our estimates into the fraction of expenditures covered by insurers. Figure 12 shows the
estimated coverages by medical expense grids.

Algorithm for the second step estimation

To implement our sequential estimation strategy in Section 5.2.1, we divide the parameters to be estimated into two sets: θ1 = {φW , φB , λht } and θ2 = {βlow/high , P r (βlow |ηi ) , θBeq ,
kBeq , c}. θ1 is the set of parameters directly affecting the labor market outcomes (first set of
moments) while θ2 is the set of parameters closely linked to the wealth profiles (second set
of moments). Our search algorithm is separated into two nested loops. In the outer loop, we
use the simplex method to find θ2 that minimizes the difference between the vector of the
S
targeted and simulated second set of moments in Figure 8 (MD
2 and M2 , respectively). In
the inner loop, for a given set of θ2 , we search for θ1 that minimizes the distance between
S
the targeted and simulated first set of moments in Figure 7 (MD
1 and M1 , respectively).
Formally, our algorithm solves the following problem:

Wealth level and number of years being unhealthy

In Section 5.4, we document the negative relationship between wealth change and the
number of periods being unhealthy over a ten-year interval between the age of 55-56 and
65-66. In this section, we consider an additional dimension by looking at the wealth level at
the age of 55-56 and 65-66. Similar to Section 5.4, we use the balanced panel of individuals
from the HRS whom we observe between ages 55-56 and 65-66 and who are healthy at age
55-56. These additional moments serve as external validation and supporting evidence for
the existence of the compositional effect in the data.
53

The infinite norm k·k∞ measures the largest gap between the targeted and simulated moments. Specifically, kxk∞ = max |xj |, where xj is the element of vector x.
j

54

More specifically, we have two tolerance levels: one for the average labor income of workers and another
for the employment profiles. We set the tolerance level of the former to $72 (or 0.2% of average income in
the model), while the latter is set to 8 percentage points. Different tolerance levels that we tried did not
affect our estimation results in any meaningful way.

51

The crosses in Figure 13 (and 14) plot the median wealth level at age 65-66 (and 55-56)
by number of unhealthy periods reported by individuals between ages 57-58 and 65-66. The
dots in the figures show that the corresponding median wealth level from our simulated
data can replicate these dynamic aspects well. The tables on the right of the figures report
the slope coefficients from the median regressions. For each additional period an individual
reports being unhealthy between 57-58 and 65-66, median wealth at age 65-66 (and 55-56)
declines by $34,473 (and $11,749).55 The corresponding coefficients from the model imply a
decline of $27,981 and $10,831, respectively.
In Figure 13, the negative relationship between wealth level at 65-66 and number of
unhealthy periods is generated by two mechanisms: direct causality and compositional difference. For the former mechanism, the multiple periods of bad health affect the accumulated
wealth directly by lowering earnings, increasing medical expenses, and lowering survival probability. For the latter mechanism, people with multiple unhealthy periods are more likely to
be βlow -type. The last two rows in the table on the right of Figure 13 show that once we run
the median regressions separately for the βlow and βhigh groups, the direct causality accounts
for around 54-65% of the negative relationship between wealth level at 65-66 and number of
unhealthy periods between ages 57-58 and 65-66.
In contrast, the negative relationship between wealth level at 55-56 and number of unhealthy periods in Figure 14 cannot be explained by causality; instead, it is driven only
by the compositional difference. Since health shock is exogenous, the realization of future
health status is orthogonal to current wealth. As shown in the table on the right, the slope
coefficients from the separate median regressions over the βlow and βhigh groups are zero.56
This reiterates our results from Section 5.3: without the compositional difference, the model
will underpredict the difference in wealth level among people experiencing different numbers
of years in bad health.
55

The negative relationship at age 55-56 is robust even when we restrict our analysis to a sample with
a more homogeneous self-reported health measure. Specifically, we run the same median regression using a
subset of our sample whose self-reported health at age 55-56 is either excellent or very good , thus excluding
those with self-reported health as good. The slope coefficient of the median wealth at age 55-56 shows a
decline of $12,531 for one additional period of being unhealthy.
56
It is possible that wealthy individuals invest more in their health than less wealthy ones; consequently
they are less likely to experience multiple periods of bad health later on. To separate this channel from the
compositional difference we need a model with health investment, which is beyond the scope of our current
study. However, the dynamic moments in Figure 13 and 14 are useful for a structural model with endogenous
health investment; thus far these moments have not been exploited in the existing literature.

Alternative calibration with SVL at $6 millions

In our baseline parameterization, we adjust the scaling parameter b so that the statistical
value of life (SVL) implied by our model is equal to $2 millions. In this section, we report the
results from an alternative parameterization when b is set to match the SVL of $6 millions.
Note that all other parameters in the model are the same as in the baseline.
Table 16 displays the willingness to pay to increase the probability of being healthy next
period by one percentage point, and Table 17 and 18 decompose this willingness to pay
by different channels through which health affects individuals over the life course. Overall,
two important differences can be noticed comparing to our baseline results (Table 11-13).
First, individuals are willing to pay more to increase their probability to be healthy: the
willingness to pay is now 10.6% of the average income, compared to 5.3% under the baseline
parameterization. Second, the relative importance of the survival channel increases: this
channel now accounts for 86% of the total willingness to pay, compared to 60% under the
baseline parameterization. Thus, when life is more valuable people are willing to pay more
to improve their health dynamics because the increase in life expectancy due to good health
is now more important.
Table 19 reports the corresponding results in Section 6.3 when the SVL is set to $6
millions. Once removing the bad health realization, the variation in lifetime utility is lowered
by 42.5% for βlow - and 12.8% and βhigh -individuals. And when excluding the survival channel
the decreases is only 7.4% and 0.2%, respectively. This confirms the finding in Section 6.3
that a larger share of lifetime inequality due to health uncertainty comes from the survival
channel.

Table 17: Decomposition of the willingness to pay for an increase in the probability of being healthy next
period when the statistical value of life is set at $6 millions. All dollar values when only one channel exists
are the averages over the distribution of individuals aged 20-64 in the reference economy. We report the
resulting values as a percentage of the dollar value when all channels operate (the first row).

Table 19: Variation of lifetime utility due to health uncertainties when the statistical value of life is set at
$6 millions. The columns under “Incl. survival channel” are from the experiment where everyone is always
healthy. The columns under “Excl. survival channel” are from the experiment where individuals are always
healthy but they die at the same age as in the reference economy.
