    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper describes the state of Long-Term Care (LTC) in England, which is facing increasing strain due to population aging. We piece together microeconomic and aggregate data in order to give an overview of the demand and supply of LTC in England in a way that facilitates comparisons with other countries, and briefly discuss current LTC policy and recent reforms.\n\n",
