Where Modern Macroeconomics Went Wrong

September 2017, Revised November 2017
JEL No. A1,A2,E0,E1
ABSTRACT
This paper provides a critique of the DSGE models that have come to dominate macroeconomics
during the past quarter-century. It argues that at the heart of the failure were the wrong
microfoundations, which failed to incorporate key aspects of economic behavior, e.g.
incorporating insights from information economics and behavioral economics. Inadequate
modelling of the financial sector meant they were ill-suited for predicting or responding to a
financial crisis; and a reliance on representative agent models meant they were ill-suited for
analysing either the role of distribution in fluctuations and crises or the consequences of
fluctuations on inequality. The paper proposes alternative benchmark models that may be more
useful both in understanding deep downturns and responding to them.

I. Introduction
Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models, which have played such an important
role in modern discussions of macroeconomics, in my judgement fail to serve the functions which
a well-designed macroeconomic model should perform. The most important challenge facing any
macro-model is to provide insights into the deep downturns that have occurred repeatedly and what
should be done in response. It would, of course, be even better if we had models that could predict
these crises. From a social perspective, whether the economy grows next year at 3.1 percent or 3.2
percent makes little difference. But crises, when GDP falls and unemployment increases
significantly, have large consequences for individual well-being now, as well as for future growth.
In particular, it is now well recognized that periods of extended economic weakness such as
confronted by the US and Europe after 2008 have significant implications for future potential
growth. 1,2
While the 2008 crisis, and the inability of the DSGE model to predict that crisis or to provide
policy guidance on how to deal with the consequences, precipitated current dissatisfaction with
the model, the failings are deeper: the DSGE model fails similarly in the context of other deep
downturns.
The DSGE models fail in explaining these major downturns, including the source of the
perturbation in the economy which gives rise to them; why shocks, which the system (in these
models) should have been able to absorb, get amplified with such serious consequences; and why
they persist, i.e. why the economy does not quickly return to full employment, as one would expect
to occur in an equilibrium model. These are not minor failings, but rather go to the root of the
deficiencies in the model. 3
What we seek from “benchmark model” in macroeconomics is not always clear. Vines (written
correspondence) suggests that we should be looking for a simple model which we could teach to
graduate students to provide them with a less misleading framework on which to build whatever
research project they are engaged with.

1
This implies that macro-econometrics should use a Bayesian loss function with a high weight in explaining/predicting
deep downturns. This is markedly different from assessing models by looking at how well they match particular covariances or moments. Practitioners of DSGE macro-econometrics claim to use Bayesian estimation approaches, by
which they mean they include priors (e.g. concerning the values of certain parameters). I emphasize here another
aspect: a loss function which puts high weight on being able to predict the events we care about. In terms of priors,
the following discussion make clear that I find some of the priors embedded in the standard model less than persuasive.
2
DSGE models are, of course, not really a model of medium- to long-term growth: that is determined by factors like
the pace of innovation and the accumulation of human capital on which they provide little insight. To understand the
former, for instance, one needs a much more detailed analysis of technological progress, including investments in
basic research and the transmission of knowledge across and within firms, than any standard macro-model can provide.
3
There are a myriad of versions of the DSGE model, and some versions may have attempted to address one or the
other of the concerns I raise. I cannot in the confines of this short article explain why the purported remedies do not
adequately address the problems.

2

Blanchard (2017) suggests:
The models should capture what we believe are the macro-essential characteristics of
the behavior of firms and people, and not try to capture all relevant dynamics. Only
then can they serve their purpose, remain simple enough, and provide a platform for
theoretical discussions.
Thus, a distinction is often made between the core DSGE model as a benchmark model and the
variety of expanded models, which introduces a large number of complexities—more shocks than
just technology shocks; and more frictions than just nominal wage and price rigidities. 4 To be sure,
as many users of DSGE models have become aware of one or more of the weaknesses of these
models, they have “broadened” the model, typically in an ad hoc manner. 5 There has ensued a
Ptolemaic attempt to incorporate some feature or another that seems important that had previously
been left out of the model. The result is that the models lose whatever elegance they might have
had and claims that they are based on solid microfoundations are weakened, 6 as is confidence in
the analyses of policies relying on them. The resulting complexity often makes it even more
difficult to interpret what is really going on.
And with so many parameters, macro-econometrics becomes little more than an exercise in curve
fitting, with an arbitrarily chosen set of moments generated by the model contrasted with reality.
Standard statistical standards are shunted aside. Korinek (2017) provides a devastating critique:
First, the time series employed are typically detrended using methods such as the HP
filter to focus the analysis on stationary fluctuations at business cycle frequencies.
Although this is useful in some applications, it risks throwing the baby out with the
bathwater as many important macroeconomic phenomena are non-stationary or occur
at lower frequencies. An example of particular relevance in recent years are the growth
effects of financial crises.
Second, for given detrended time series, the set of moments chosen to evaluate the
model and compare it to the data is largely arbitrary—there is no strong scientific basis
for one particular set of moments over another. The macro profession has developed
certain conventions, focusing largely on second moments, i.e. variances and
4

See Smets and Wouters (2003). They introduce a total of ten “shocks”—“two ‘supply’ shocks, a productivity and a
labor supply shock, (…) three ‘demand’ shocks (a preference shock, a shock to the investment adjustment cost
function, and a government consumption shock), three ‘cost-push’ shocks ((…) to the mark-up in the goods and labor
markets and (…) to the required risk premium on capital) and two ‘monetary policy’ shocks”—and multiple frictions,
including “external habit formation in consumption,” a “cost of adjusting the capital stock,” and “partial indexation
of the prices and wages that cannot be re-optimised.”
5
Thus, the Smets–Wouters model introduces individual heterogeneity, but everyone has the same preferences, there
are no capitalists or workers, and accordingly no differences in marginal propensities to consume. In this context,
redistributions have no effect on aggregate demand. Below, we argue that redistributions may matter.
6
A claim that is already stretched when it comes to the use of an aggregate production function (see below) and the
derivation of the demand for money. There are, of course, assumptions that seem to provide microfoundations, e.g.
the derivation of the demand for money based on the assumption that there is a “cash in advance” requirement. But
credit, not cash, or money as it is usually defined, is typically required. See Greenwald and Stiglitz (2003). Many
models embrace a “cop-out,” putting money into the utility function. Later, I will explain why one cannot rely for
policy analyses on results derived from these “toy” models, or models embracing such ad hoc assumptions.

covariances. However, this is problematic for some of the most important
macroeconomic events, such as financial crises, which are not well captured by second
moments. Financial crises are rare tail events that introduce a lot of skewness and fat
tails into time series. As a result, a good model of financial crises may well distinguish
itself by not matching the traditional second moments used to evaluate regular business
cycle models, which are driven by a different set of shocks. In such instances, the
criterion of matching traditional moments may even be a dangerous guide for how
useful a model is for the real world. For example, matching the variance of output
during the 2000s does not generally imply that a model is a good description of output
dynamics over the decade.
Third, for a given set of moments, there is no well-defined statistic to measure the
goodness of fit of a DSGE model or to establish what constitutes an improvement in
such a framework. Whether the moments generated by the model satisfactorily match
the moments observed in the real world is often determined by an eyeball comparison
and is largely at the discretion of the reader. The scientific rigor of this method is
questionable.
Fourth, [DSGE models] frequently impose a number of restrictions that are in direct
conflict with micro evidence. If a model has been rejected along some dimensions,
then a statistic that measures the goodness-of-fit along other dimensions is
meaningless.
Korinek’s conclusion, that “the scientific rigor” of this methodology is “questionable,” must be
considered an understatement. 7
Sometimes, too, a distinction is made between a “policy model,” giving practical advice on what
to do in different circumstances, and a model with sound theoretical underpinnings. Thus, the
standard Keynesian model might (it could be argued) be good enough for telling us whether and
how to stimulate the economy, but the fact that its underlying equations are not microfounded
makes it theoretically unacceptable; for good theory, we have to turn to DSGE models. These
distinctions are, I think, wrong on two accounts. First, as I explain below, I believe the core DSGE
models is not good theory: good theory is based on how firms and households actually behave and
markets actually work. 8 If credit availability is more important than interest rates, then a model
which assumes that there is no credit rationing is bad theory. In the crisis, banks couldn’t get access
to funds; they were liquidity constrained. Such constraints are not consistent with the underlying
7

I should emphasize: empirical tests should not be limited to standard statistics. On average, black holes don’t exist.
They are rare events, but their existence plays a crucial role in confirming the theory. They would not be uncovered
through a standard regression. A single experiment (observation) was enough to largely confirm Einstein’s relativity
theory.
8
Thus, what is sometimes meant by providing microfoundations is providing foundations based on a particular model
of human behavior, rational individuals with perfect information operating in competitive markets, a model which has
been widely discredited. Note that in the “microfoundation fundamentalist” view, an analysis of a giraffe’s behavior
could not include the assumption that it had a long neck, because we cannot explain either why it has a long neck or
how it can survive, given that it has a long neck (assuming that standard models of circulatory systems could not
explain how blood could be pumped that high).

4

DSGE model. And second, the reason for having a model derived with microfoundations is that a
policy change could change certain aspects of previously observed reduced form relationships.
One has to have a theory to ascertain whether it would. Good policy requires an understanding of
the underlying determinants of behavior.
So too, short-term policy involves short-term forecasting. As Chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers—established by the US Congress to help ensure that the economy remain at
full employment through appropriate macroeconomic interventions—under President Clinton, I
had the responsibility for overseeing our forecasts, which were also used in budgetary projections.
Though it was before the development of the current generation of DSGE models, many of the
considerations upon which we focused are excluded from the standard models. We were, for
instance, concerned with changes in expectations. But analyses of expectations were (correctly, in
my view) not based on what those might be if it were assumed that individuals had rational
expectations, or acted as if they did, but on survey data of what expectations are and have been. 9
So too, we were concerned with changes in consumption. The determination of consumption is,
clearly, a key aspect of any good macro-model. But it is clear that in the short to medium term, the
shifts in household savings rates are little related to the considerations on which the intertemporal
utility maximization of a representative agent focuses. That model cannot provide accurate
predictions of such changes, identifying either shifts in preferences or technology, or even of
expectations (especially if those are supposed to be “rational”) that give rise to changes in
consumption. 10
Nor has the DSGE model been useful for policy design, e.g. the best way to “deliver” a tax cut.
Behavioral economics has provided, I believe, a persuasive case that savings behavior is subject
to nudges, in ways that are inconsistent with the standard model. 11 Importantly, differences in
responses to the US tax cuts of 2008 and 2009 have more to do with behavioral economics than
the determinants of savings behavior incorporated into DSGE models. 12
But DSGE models seem to take it as a religious tenet that consumption should be explained by a
model of a representative agent maximizing his utility over an infinite lifetime without borrowing
constraints. 13 Doing so is called microfounding the model. But economics is a behavioral science.
9

Moreover, these surveys show that different groups in the population have distinctly different beliefs (expectations),
inconsistent with assumptions of rational expectations and common knowledge. See, for example, Jonung (1981),
Jonung and Laidler (1988), and Bruine de Bruin et al. (2010).
10
Of course, ex post, one can sometimes interpret changes in consumption as if there were a change in intertemporal
preferences. The theory of consumer behavior is meaningful, however, only if preferences are stable or change in
predictable ways.
11
See Camerer et al. (2011) and the discussion of behavioral economics and savings in the context of macroeconomics.
There is ample evidence that individuals’ retirement savings cannot be explained within the standard model. See
Hamermesh (1984) and Banks et al. (1998).
12
See Parker et al. (2013).
13
The fact that these constraints markedly change savings behavior has been long recognized. See, for example,
Newbery and Stiglitz (1982). Deaton (1991), Aiyagari (1994), and Carroll (1992, 1997, 2001) provide empirical
support. A major criticism of standard DSGE models provided by Hendry and Muellbauer (2018) is that they ignore
these constraints and assume “cash and other liquid assets, stock market and pension wealth minus household debt,
and housing wealth as equally spendable.”

5

If Keynes was right that individuals saved a constant fraction of their income, an aggregate model
based on that assumption is microfounded. Of course, the economy consists of individuals who
are different, but all of whom have a finite life and most of whom are credit constrained, and who
do adjust their consumption behavior, if slowly, in response to changes in their economic
environment. Thus, we also know that individuals do not save a constant fraction of their income,
come what may. So both stories, the DSGE and the old-fashioned Keynesian, are simplifications.
When they are incorporated into a simple macro-model, one is saying the economy acts as if . . .
And then the question is, which provides a better description; a better set of prescriptions; and a
better basis for future elaboration of the model. The answer is not obvious. The criticism of DSGE
is thus not that it involves simplification: all models do. It is that it has made the wrong modelling
choices, choosing complexity in areas where the core story of macroeconomic fluctuations could
be told using simpler hypotheses, but simplifying in areas where much of the macroeconomic
action takes place.
The complexities of the DSGE model require drastic simplifications: to analyze the model, strong
parameterizations are required. We know that the parameterizations used in the DSGE models (e.g.
constant elasticity utility functions 14) yield predictions that can easily be rejected (e.g. all
individuals have exactly the same portfolio of risky assets, and homothetic preferences—unitary
income elasticities for all goods and unitary wealth elasticities for all assets 15). To make matters
worse, even with all the implausible parameterizations, the large DSGE models that account for
some of the more realistic features of the macroeconomy are typically “solved” only for linear
approximations and small shocks—precluding the big shocks that take us far away from the
domain over which the linear approximation has validity. 16

II. The core of the failing: the wrong microfoundations
The core of the failings of the DSGE model can be traced to the attempt, decades ago, to reconcile
macroeconomics with microeconomics. There were two approaches. The first was taken by real
business cycle (RBC) theory and its descendant, DSGE, which attempted to reformulate
macroeconomics by taking the microfoundations of a simplified version of the competitive
equilibrium model—just as that model was being discredited by advances in behavioral
economics, game theory, and the economics of information. That strand attempted to explain

14

It is never made clear why we should feel better about a model that assumes a constant elasticity of marginal utility
than a model that assumes a constant savings rate.
15
This is true if there is more than one good or more than one asset—and clearly, “good theory” has to be consistent
with that being the case. See Stiglitz (1969). Our toy models shouldn’t break down when we move from one good to
two goods. See the discussion below.
16
More recently, techniques have been developed for solving DSGE models with non-linearities. Though some of
the models incorporate some of the features that we argue here should be included in any good macro-model,
they still leave out many crucial features, make many unreasonable parameterizations, and test their models using
unsatisfactory methodologies, as described elsewhere in this paper. For a survey of the advances in non-linear
methodologies, see Fernandez-Villaverde and Levintal (2017), and the references cited there.

unemployment and other deviations from predictions of the standard competitive model by looking
for the minimal change in that model—assuming (typically nominal) price and wage rigidities.
The second strand (see, for example, Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997),
Greenwald and Stiglitz, 1987a,b, 1988a,b, 1993a,b, 2003) and the references cited there), only
entering into the mainstream in the aftermath of the Great Recession, attempted to bring together
modern micro with macro, incorporating one or more of the ways in which actual markets are far
from perfect (“market failures”)—besides the possibility of nominal wage and price rigidities, and
to which they gave a different interpretation and explanation.17 In doing so, this strand resurrected
the thinking of Irving Fisher (1933), who promulgated a quite different version of macropdynamics
than the Hicksian interpretation of Keynes based on wage and price rigidity. Fisher emphasized
the consequences of flexibility and debt-deflation. The departures from the standard competitive
equilibrium model which play a critical role in these models include incomplete contracts and
capital market imperfections, including those associated with imperfect information, incomplete
risk markets, 18 and market irrationalities. (Minsky (1986) was particularly influential in the latter.)
It is perhaps worth noting that policy-makers in recent downturns—in Japan, Europe, and even the
US—have been focused on deflation, on the possibility that prices might fall, not on price
rigidities. 19
In the discussion below, I illustrate the inadequacies of the DSGE framework by focusing on the
2008 crisis. Some advocates of DSGE models say these models were not meant to address “oncein-a-hundred-year floods.” There are several responses to this defence. The first is by way of
analogy: What would one think of a medical doctor who, when a patient comes with a serious
disease, responded by saying, “I am sorry, but I only deal with colds”?
The second is that not only did the model fail to predict the crisis; it effectively said that it could
not happen. Under the core hypotheses (rational expectation, exogenous shocks), a crisis of that
form and magnitude simply could not occur.
Crises bring out into the open deficiencies in the model that are not so apparent in our smaller and
more frequent fluctuations. I believe that most of the core constituents of the DSGE model are
flawed—sufficiently badly flawed that they do not provide even a good starting point for
constructing a good macroeconomic model. These include (a) the theory of consumption; (b) the
theory of expectations—rational expectations and common knowledge; (c) the theory of
investment; (d) the use of the representative agent model (and the simple extensions to incorporate
heterogeneity that so far have found favour in the literature): distribution matters; (e) the theory of
17

Indeed, information economics had identified the possibility of real rigidities—in competitive equilibrium, real
wages and interest rates could be set at levels at which markets do not clear. Risk aversion and instrument uncertainty
provide an explanation for slow adjustments. See Greenwald and Stiglitz (1989). More recently, Fajgelbaum et al.
(2017) have provided a simple general model in which information flows more slowly during recessions, and so
uncertainty is higher and persists.
18
The contrast with the Smets–Wouters (2003) model is clear: they assume a complete set of state-contingent
securities insuring households against variations in their income.
19
Greenwald and Stiglitz show that there will be real consequences to unexpected disinflation, including through real
balance effects. They show that this will be so, whether the resulting redistributive effects are between bank lenders
and firms or among firms.

7

financial markets and money; (f) aggregation—excessive aggregation hides much that is of first
order macroeconomic significance; (g) shocks—the sources of perturbation to the economy; and
(h) the theory of adjustment to shocks—including hypotheses about the speed of and mechanism
for adjustment to equilibrium or about out-of-quilibrium behavior. I cannot review in detail all of
these and other failings—such as the failure to include crucial institutional details—in this brief
note, and so I am selective, highlighting a few as examples of more general problems. Many of
these are related. For instance, the presence of imperfect and asymmetric information leads to
credit and equity rationing. Thus, individuals in maximizing their lifetime utility have to take into
account credit constraints and, as we have already noted, this gives rise to a markedly different
problem than that analysed in the standard DSGE model. One of the reasons that the representative
agent model doesn’t work well is that some individuals are credit constrained, others are not.
Moreover, numerous studies (see, for example, Kim et al. (2014); Mian and Suffi (2015);
Drehmann et al. (2017)) have emphasized the importance of debt for aggregative behavior; but in
a representative agent model, debt (held domestically) nets out, and therefore should have no
role. 20 At least at times, short-run to medium-term macroeconomic analysis needs to pay careful
attention to debt and real debt-dynamics. And here, institutional details can matter. The shift from
30-year fixed-rate mortgages to variable rate mortgages with shorter terms played an important
role in the crisis, especially when combined with expectations that were not fully rational and
credit constraints: when house prices didn’t increase as expected (and it should have been clear
that they couldn’t increase forever at those rates) and homeowners faced constraints in refinancing,
the bubble broke, and the crisis ensued. 21
As I noted earlier, my approach and that of DSGE models begin with the same starting point: the
competitive equilibrium model of Arrow and Debreu. It is clear that that model cannot explain
many aspects of the economy, including macroeconomic fluctuations. DSGE models begin with
the question, What is the minimum deviation from that model required to match macroeconomic
behavior interpreted largely as matching moments? Their first answer was price and wage
rigidities, with unanticipated and not fully insured technology shocks. When that failed to do an
adequate job, they added multiple shocks and distortions, in a fairly ad hoc way. Standards for
what was meant by “microfounding” were similarly ad hoc: putting money into a utility function
“explains” money holdings, but tells us nothing about what happens if, for instance, credit
availability changes or the probability distribution of monetary emissions changes as a result of a
change in monetary policy. 22

20

The introduction of corporations, with corporate debt owed to households (discussed later), does not address the
issues raised here, focusing on household debt.
21
This part of the story of the 2008 crisis is now well accepted. See Stiglitz (2010b,c) and Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission (2011).
22
The former might affect the transactions demand for money (credit, not money, is used in most transactions, as
noted by Greenwald and Stiglitz (2003)); the latter affects the demand for money as a store of value. See, for example,
Tobin (1958), the critique of the portfolio separation theorem (Cass and Stiglitz, 1970), and the implications for
monetary and macro-theory (Stiglitz, forthcoming).

8

III. Explaining deep downturns
The approach that I am advocating begins by ascertaining which of the advances in modern
microeconomics are most relevant for understanding the fundamental questions of macroeconomic
fluctuations: the source of the shocks; amplification—why seemingly small or moderate shocks
can have such large effects on macroeconomic variables and individual well-being; and
persistence—why the effects of the shocks persist, with say high levels of unemployment long
after the initial shock. The interpretation of these deep downturns should translate into policy,
explaining, for instance, why government expenditure multipliers may be quite large (consistent
with the earlier amplification analysis) and why monetary policy may be relatively ineffective. In
this analysis, information imperfections and asymmetries and behavioral economics often play a
central role, as do institutions and distributional effects. As I argue below, for instance, the
ineffectiveness of monetary policy is not really attributable to the zero lower bound but to the
behavior of banks, the central institution in providing credit to all but the largest firms. 23
Because the 2008 crisis was a financial crisis, the standard DSGE models are particularly poorly
designed to analyze its origins and evolution: The central problems of finance—bankruptcy, debt,
and asymmetric information—simply cannot arise in a representative agent model. 24 Who is
supposed to lend to whom? And only if the representative agent is suffering from acute
schizophrenia can there be issues of information asymmetries, and it is hard to reconcile such
schizophrenia with the usual assumptions concerning rationality.
Some DSGE models (e.g. Smets and Wouters, 2003) try to introduce rudimentary finance through
having a corporate and a household sector. But the 2008 crisis can’t be explained within that
model: it was some households borrowing from others that gave rise to the crisis. Besides, with a
representative agent, with or without firms, finance would always be provided in the form of
equity—so there still wouldn’t be bankruptcies and debt crises. 25

(i) The shocks

23

My argument corresponds closely to that of Hendry and Muellbauer (2018), who note that “A major problem with
the claim of ‘theory consistency’ is the question of ‘which theory?’ For example, text-book theory, which assumes
efficient and close-to-complete markets, well-informed relatively homogeneous agents, little uncertainty, no credit or
liquidity constraints, and a stable economy, contrasts with theory that takes account of the asymmetric information
revolution of the 1970s and early 1980s associated with Nobel prize winners Stiglitz, Akerlof, and Spence. Relevant
theory must incorporate credit and liquidity constraints, incomplete markets with incomplete insurance and high levels
of individual and macro uncertainty.’
24
The Congressional inquiry into the 2008 crisis called itself the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission and focused on
aspects of the financial sector like credit rating agencies and the role of credit default swaps (CDSs), derivatives, and
other complex financial instruments. The standard DSGE models have nothing to say about either of these: these are
failings related to its inadequate treatment of the financial sector.
25
There are further criticisms of their particular formulation: with a corporate sector, wealth would have to include
the capitalized value of future dividends (they ignore this aspect of wealth). Recent research in macroeconomics has
focused on variations in the value of corporations relative to the value of their capital goods, as a result of changes,
e.g. in tax laws and market power. See, for instance, Gonzales (2016), Gonzales and Trivin (2017), and Stiglitz (2015,
2016b).

9

The critique of the DSGE models’ relevance for deep downturns in general and the 2008 crisis in
particular begins with the source of the crisis itself. For instance, in (most) DSGE models,
downturns are caused by an exogenous technology shock. In agriculture, we know what a negative
technology shock means—bad weather or a plague of locusts. But what does that mean in a modern
industrial economy—an epidemic of some disease that resulted in a loss of collective knowledge
of how to produce? 26
By contrast the shocks giving rise to economic fluctuations in many, if not most cases, is clearly
endogenous. 27 The 2008 shock was endogenous, caused by the breaking of the housing bubble—
something that markets created, and to which misguided policies may have contributed. 28 And to
the extent that there are exogenous shocks, the extent to which firms and households are exposed
to those shocks is endogenous, affected by the structure of the market.

(ii) Finance: preventing excessive risks and designing stable systems
The main problem in crisis prevention today centers around preventing the financial sector from
undertaking excessive risks and ensuring the stability of the financial system. Policy-makers
recognize that some of the most important shocks to the economy can come from the financial
sector.
In standard models, the money demand equation is supposed to summarize all that is relevant for
finance; and, indeed, not even that is very relevant—all that matters is that somehow the central
bank is able to control the interest rate. 29 But the interest rate for T-bills is not the interest rate
confronting households and firms; the spread between the two is a critical endogenous variable. 30
While large firms may turn to capital markets, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) rely
on the banking system. Under current arrangements, the links between aggregate credit creation
and the levers controlled by the regulatory authorities, including the central bank, are tenuous and

26

Conceptually, there can be a shock to (beliefs about) the total supply of a critical natural resource—with a belief
that, for instance, there was a large supply of oil underneath Saudi Arabia being disproved. While the oil crises of the
1970s were a result of an oil shock, it was politics, not a technology shock of the kind incorporated in DSGE models.
27
For example, inventory fluctuations. Later, we note that the economy is best described as adjusting to shocks through
a decentralized process of wage and price adjustments. Such adjustment processes themselves may give rise to
economic fluctuations. See, for example, Stiglitz (2016a). The one exception to the view just expressed, that shocks
are endogenous, relates to open emerging economies, where there is some evidence that many, if not most, come from
abroad. But here, too, the DSGE models fail. The economy’s exposure to exogenous risks is endogenous. The “rules
of engagement,” e.g. the rules governing capital market liberalization, determine the extent to which a country is
affected by shocks occurring elsewhere. See Ocampo and Stiglitz (2008) and Stiglitz (2010a,b).
28
See, for example, Bernanke (2009), Demyanyk and Von Hemert (2009), Sowell (2009), and Mian and Sufi (2015).
29
This hypothesis can be directly tested, and rejected. See Fama (2013).
30
This is one of the central points in Greenwald and Stiglitz (2003), who develop a simple model of banking in which
the spread is determined. The importance of this spread has been noted in other papers in this issue. See, for example,
Vines and Willis (2018). Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) show that the spread has a predictive power on economic
activity.

variable. Among the most important levers are regulations that have typically not been included
within the ambit of macroeconomic analysis. 31
Moreover, finance and the structure of the financial system matter for stability. Understanding the
structures that are most conducive to stability, and the central trade-offs (e.g. between the ability
to withstand small and large shocks) represents one of the areas of important advances since the
crisis. 32 These were questions not even posed within the DSGE framework—they could not be
posed because they do not arise in the absence of a well-specified financial sector, and would not
arise within a model with a representative financial institution.
One of the key reasons that representative agent models fail in enhancing understanding of macrofluctuations is the pervasiveness of macroeconomic externalities—the actions of each agent (in the
aggregate) have macroeconomic consequences which they do not take into account. These
externalities help us understand why markets on their own may be excessively fragile and
excessively exposed to risks. Such macroeconomic externalities do not arise in RBC models, and
only to a limited extent in standard DSGE models. In the presence of incomplete risk markets and
imperfect and asymmetric information, pecuniary externalities matter, and the market equilibrium
is in general not Pareto efficient (Greenwald and Stiglitz, 1986; Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis,
1986). Corporations may, for instance, undertake excessive debt (in open economies, excessive
dollar-denominated debt), implying that in a downturn there may be fire sales, with the resulting
decrease in prices having balance sheet effects, amplifying the downturn (see the next section). 33
Banks engage in contracts with each other that may be individually rational, but result in greater
systemic risk, particularly in the face of a large shock. 34 RBC models are structured so that these
macroeconomic externalities don’t arise, and so markets are always efficient, even in their
response to shocks; and in the new Keynesian models with rigid wages and prices that are their
successors, they arise only to a limited extent.35 By contrast, they are at the center of the alternative
models for which we are arguing in this paper, and help explain the significant deviations from
efficient outcomes.

31

And again, these levers are typically left out of the standard DSGE model, even though they may be far more
effective. The point is simple: if banks are constrained in their lending by capital adequacy or liquidity constraints,
changes in those constraints can have large effects, far greater than those generated by the “substitution effects” that
arise as returns to T-bills and loans changes. See Greenwald and Stiglitz (2003). Changes in these rules were part of
the policy strategy that helped the economy emerge from the 1991–2 recession (Stiglitz, 2003).
32
While some work had begun in this area before the crisis (see Allen and Gale (2000), Greenwald and Stiglitz (2003),
and Gallegati et al. (2008)), the crisis itself provided enormous impetus to research in this area: see Allen et al. (2010),
Roitman et al. (2010), Stiglitz (2010a,d), Gai and Kapadia (2010), Battiston et al. (2012a), Acemoğlu et al. (2016),
Haldane (2009), Haldane and May (2011), and Battiston et al. (2016). Complexity in financial structures may make it
even impossible to ascertain whether a system is systemically stable. See Roukny et al. (2017). So too, additional
financial instruments can lead to greater economic instability (Brock et al. 2008, Caccioli et al. 2009), partly because
these financial instruments create new betting opportunities, which enhance volatility (Guzman and Stiglitz 2016a, b).
33
See Korinek (2010, 2011a,b, 2012), Jeanne and Korinek (2010), and Davila and Korinek (2017). Shleifer and
Vishny (2011) provide a partial review of firesale models.

See, for instance, ch. 7 of Greenwald and Stiglitz (2003).

See Farhi and Werning (2016).

11

In the standard model, issues of systemic risk simply do not arise. The focus was on inflation, as
if excessive inflation was the major threat to economic stability. That has not been the case for a
third of a century; but the problems posed by financial instability have been recurrent.
One particularly important implication of the kind of models for which I am arguing here, in
contrast to the standard DSGE models, is that in the presence of bankruptcy costs, excessive
diversification (capital market integration) may result in shocks being amplified, rather than
dampened and dissipated—as assumed by the Federal Reserve and predicted by the standard
models. 36 Indeed, policy discourse based on assumptions underlying DSGE models had a kind of
incoherence: before a crisis, the conventional wisdom called for diversification—as much as
possible, e.g. through securitization and financial linkages/risk sharing. After the onset of a crisis,
discourse turned to contagion. The word itself, borrowed from epidemiology, suggest the opposite
of diversification: were 100 individuals with Ebola to arrive in New York, no one would
recommend a policy of diversification, sending two to each state. Contagion arises because of such
linkages. Unless one has succeeded in eliminating the prospect of future crises, the design of an
economic system has to take into account the functioning of the system both before and after a
crisis, balancing the benefits of linkages before and the costs afterwards. The conventional wisdom
never did that. This is not a minor failing, but a major one.

(iii) Amplification and persistence
Beyond explaining the origins of shocks and the extent to which economies get exposed to shocks,
an adequate macro-model needs to explain how even a moderate shock has large macroeconomic
consequences. One of the key failures in the 2008 crisis was the prediction that even a large subprime crisis would not have large economic consequences because the risks had been diversified.
Within the DSGE frame that was being used at the time by key policy-makers, this was a natural
conclusion. Other models, however, had predicted otherwise, focusing on important amplifiers
within the economy—and, indeed, some of these became part of the standard “explanations” of
the crisis.
One source of amplification is “balance sheet effects,” the contraction in production and
investment that arises when firms suffer a shock to their balance sheets. Providing
microfoundations for balance sheet effects requires an analysis of why firms can’t replace the lost
equity with new equity, i.e. an explanation of equity rationing (see, for example, Greenwald et al.
(1984)). Modern information-based finance provides such a theory, and these ideas have already
been integrated into simple theoretical and applied macro-models, in models in which firms’
supply and demand decisions are a function of their balance sheets (see Greenwald and Stiglitz

36
See, for instance, Bernanke’s remarks concerning the risk posed by the collapse of the sub-prime market (see
Bernanke, 2009). Bankruptcy costs introduce a non-convexity in the analysis—suggesting a fundamental way in which
the mathematics of DSGE models would have to be altered. Recent models with financial linkages and bankruptcy
costs have shown that dense networks, with many linkages, while better able to handle small and uncorrelated shocks,
perform more poorly in response to large shocks. For analyses of optimal diversification, see, for example, Stiglitz
(2010a,d) and Battiston et al. (2012a,b).

12

(1993b) and Koo (2008)). 37 Greenwald and Stiglitz show, for instance, how a price shock
(resulting from, say, a shock to demand for the product) gets amplified through the firm’s
subsequent decisions on how much to produce, how much labor to hire, and how much to invest.
The effects are amplified still further if there is credit rationing. Not only is there a well-developed
theory of credit rationing (e.g. Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981), Calomiris and Hubbard (1989) among
others have shown that these constraints are binding in important sectors of the economy, and it
appears that they are particularly relevant in those sectors subject to large fluctuations in
investment. This played out strongly in the evolution of the 2008 crisis where, by 2010, large firms
seemed to be sitting on a couple of trillion dollars of cash, while SMEs remained credit constrained.
At the center of the modern theory of credit rationing, as observed at the macro level, are banks—
a critical institution which was missing from DSGE models. This was a particularly peculiar
omission because, without banks, there presumably would be no central banks, and it is the central
bank’s conduct of monetary policy that is central in those models. The fact that credit is allocated
by institutions (banks), rather than through conventional markets (auctions) is an important
distinction lost in the DSGE framework. Greenwald and Stiglitz (2003) model banks as firms,
which take others’ capital, in combination with their own, obtaining and processing information,
making decisions about which loans to make. They too are by and large equity constrained, but in
addition face a large number of regulatory constraints. Shocks to their balance sheets, changes in
the available set of loans and their expectations about returns, and alterations in regulations lead
to large changes in loan supply and the terms at which loans are made available. Variations in
regulations and circumstances of banks across states in the US are helping validate the importance
of variation in the supply conditions in banking in the 2008 crisis and its aftermath. 38
Given how long it takes balance sheets to be restored when confronted with a shock of the size of
that of 2008, it is not surprising that the effects persisted. 39 But they seem to have persisted even
after the restoration of bank and firm balance sheets. That suggests that this crisis (like the Great
Depression) is more than a balance sheet crisis. It is part of a structural transformation, in the
advanced countries, the most notable aspects of which are a shift from manufacturing to a servicesector economy and an outsourcing of unskilled production to emerging markets; for developing
countries, the structural transformation involves industrialization and globalization. Not
surprisingly, such structural transformations have large macroeconomic consequences and are an

37
One implication of equity-constrained firms is that firms will act in a risk-averse manner—behavior which is
markedly different from that assumed in the standard DSGE models. See Greenwald and Stiglitz (1990a,b, 2003). An
important implication of Greenwald and Stiglitz (1993b) is that aggregate behavior is not just a function of averages,
e.g. a shock that increases the balance sheets of some firms (oil exporters) but decreases that of other firms (oil
importers) in the same amount will have an adverse effect on aggregate demand and supply. Empirically, it should be
possible to incorporate this effect, at least partially.
38
Hamid Rashid in some recent unpublished analyses has been able to demonstrate this.
39
Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) emphasize that financial crises tend to be long and persistent. But when the economy
experiences a deep real shock, it is inevitable that eventually there will be consequences for the financial sector,
including banking. The stock market crash of 1929 didn’t turn into a full-scale banking crisis until several years later.
Italy’s current banking crisis is the result of its prolonged stagnation. If financial crises are largely the result of deep
and prolonged real shocks, then the statement that economic crises associated with financial crises are long lasting
says nothing more than that deep and prolonged crises are deep and prolonged.

13

essential part of growth processes. DSGE models are particularly unsuited to address their
implications for several reasons: (a) the assumption of rational expectations, and even more
importantly, common knowledge, might be relevant in the context of understanding fluctuations
and growth in an agricultural environment with well-defined weather shocks described by a
stationary distribution, 40 but it cannot describe changes, like these, that happen rarely; 41 (b)
studying these changes requires at least a two-sector model; and (c) a key market failure is the free
mobility of resources, especially labor, across sectors. Again, simple models have been constructed
investigating how structural transformation can lead to a persistent high level of unemployment,
and how, even then, standard Keynesian policies can restore full employment, but by contrast,
increasing wage flexibility can increase unemployment (see Delli Gatti et al., 2012ae b).

(iv) Adjustment and equilibrium
One of the reasons that downturns with high levels of unemployment persist relates to the process
of adjustment. 42 DSGE models don’t address that issue: they simply assume that the economy
jumps to the new equilibrium path. 43 Though in a model with a single individual, solving for the
value of current values of wages and prices which ensures that the transversality condition is
satisfied is conceptually clear (the super-smart individual simply thinks through the consequences
of choosing any other set of current wages and prices), it is not apparent how that is to be done in
the context of a world without common knowledge. If there were a full set of markets extending
infinitely far into the future, the problem I described would not occur. But there are not—this is
one of the key market failures. 44 That the consequences could be “resolved” by the existence of a
representative agent provides no insight into how the absence of these markets is addressed in the
actual world. Indeed, this problem arises even if the only difference among individuals is their date
of birth; with overlapping generations, and at least some individuals not behaving as if there is a
40

With global warming, even the assumption that variations in weather are described by a stationary distribution is
clearly not correct.
41
Knight (1921) distinguished between risk and uncertainty. The standard model with rational expectations models
risk. Here, there is fundamental uncertainty.
42
As we have noted, empirical DSGE models have introduced a large number of factors to smooth out behavior, e.g.
costs of adjustment in investment and habit formation in consumption. Many of these prolong booms, but some should
have the effect of shortening the downturn.
43
If, of course, there are costs of adjustment, the size of the jump may be affected by the structure and magnitude of
those costs. My critique here parallels that of Hendry and Muellbauer (2018, this issue) who noted “the notion that the
economy follows a stable long-run trend is highly questionable, despite heroic attempts by policy-makers to stabilize
the path.” My critique goes further: DSGE models assume that even without government intervention, the economy
is on the (unique) convergent path. Hendry and Muellbauer go on to argue:
The world is usually in disequilibrium: economies are wide-sense non-stationary from evolution and sudden,
often unanticipated, shifts both affecting key variables directly and many more indirectly. . . . The assumption
made in the business-cycle accounting framework that the economy is never very far from its steady-state
trend was simply wrong. These models were unable to capture the possibility of without gof financial
accelerator that operated in the US sub-prime crisis and the resulting financial crisis. They ignored the shock
amplifying, propagating, and potentially destabilizing processes in the financial accelerator.
44

Discussed long ago by Hahn (1966). See also Shell and Stiglitz (1967).

dynastic utility function extending over infinity, there can not only exist sunspot equilibrium (Cass
and Shell, 1983), but there can be an infinity of paths consistent with rational expectations (see
Hirano and Stiglitz, 2017).
Indeed, there is a disparity between an analysis based on the assumption of instantaneous
adjustment to a new equilibrium, and what actually happens—and what most policy economists
assume. There is a decentralized process of wage and price adjustment, with wages and prices in
each market responding to the tightness in that market (in the labor market, that is the simple
Phillips curve, asserting that wages rise when labor markets become tight). Obviously, adjustment
processes may be more complicated in a macroeconomic environment with inflation, where
nominal adjustments would be expected to take into account inflationary expectations.
In the short run, such adjustment processes may be disequilibrating: the fall in wages as a result of
unemployment may result in a decrease in aggregate demand, increasing the level of
unemployment. This is especially true (an implicit assumption in Keynes; an explicit assumption
in Kaldor (1957) and Pasinetti (1962)) if the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) differs across
groups; the lowering of wages shifts income towards profits, and capitalists’ MPC is lower than
that of workers.
What matters is, of course, real wages, and that depends on the adjustment of wages relative to
prices (see Solow and Stiglitz, 1968). Wages and prices may both be falling, at the same rate,
resulting in real wages being constant, a kind of real wage rigidity. The increase in real balances
(real value of money holdings) would normally be expected to increase spending, but this effect is
relatively small, so that the unemployment equilibrium could still persist for a long time.
Moreover, the deflation itself has a depressing effect, since it increases the real interest rate
(holding everything else constant). In addition, if, as assumed in the previous paragraph, different
groups in the economy have different MPCs, the (unexpected) deflation 45 redistributes income
from debtors to creditors, and this depresses aggregate consumption even more (see Eggertsson
and Krugman (2012) and Korinek and Simsek (2016)). (Even more so, in an open economy, where
the creditor is abroad: it is akin to a transfer of income to foreigners, with especially great effect
then on demand for non-traded goods.) 46 Similarly, adjustments of prices have balance sheet
effects of the kind already discussed, with large macroeconomic consequences.

(v) Financial frictions
Not surprisingly, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis there is a growing consensus that at
least one critical failing of the standard model is its (non-)treatment of the financial sector. 47
Financial frictions, as they have come to be called, are important. These include credit and equity
rationing and the corollary importance of collateral constraints and of banks, to all of which I have
already referred. There are, of course, a variety of information and enforcement problems that can
45

That is, not incorporated into an adjustment in the interest rate charged. This particular effect would not arise if debt
contracts were fully indexed, but arises whenever there is unexpected disinflation.
46
There can also be balance sheet effects (the financial accelerator), as described earlier.
47
See Vines and Wills (2018, this issue).

15

give rise to financial frictions. Those that might provide the simplest textbook treatment—showing
their potential importance—may not be the most important. This may matter, because different
financial frictions may differ in their policy consequences. In particular, theories based on costly
enforcement (e.g. Eaton and Gersovitz, 1981) or costly state verification (Townsend, 1979) differ
markedly from those based on adverse selection and incentives, noted earlier. Similarly, though
important macroeconomic externalities may arise in any of these models (e.g. with incentive
compatibility, self-selection, or collateral constraints), and, typically, the latter are easiest to
analyze, that is partly because the constraint is not adequately endogenized. 48
Still, for purposes of a simple benchmark model, it may be far better to incorporate some financial
frictions than to ignore them altogether. Indeed, the core teaching model for macroeconomics that
I use entails a three-period model. The center of attention is today, but this is linked to the past
(decisions and shocks in the past affect current state variables) and the future. Valuation functions
summarize the future beyond tomorrow, and individuals, firms, and banks today may engage in
intertemporal trade-offs. Aggregate demand is based on reduced form functions for aggregate
consumption and aggregate investment, in which credit constraints and net worth play an important
role. Firm production and investment decisions are motivated by value-maximizing firms facing
equity constraints (in the short run, they can’t raise equity), and a rising cost of borrowing as they
borrow more (reflecting a higher leverage and an increasing expected value of bankruptcy), 49 with
a standard production function. The minimal model incorporating distribution entails two classes
of households, workers who consume their income and capitalists who maximize their
intertemporal utility function within their borrowing constraints. The central bank sets the T-bill
rate, and the loan curve is a function of that rate, bank net worth, regulations, and the state of the
economy. An adverse shock shifts the loan curve up (i.e. at any level of borrowing, the
representative firm has to pay a higher interest rate). The model can then be expanded, depending
on the question being posed. For a more extended description of the model, see the Appendix.

IV. Policy
One of the main reasons we want a good benchmark model is for policy. As we have already noted,
short-run forecasting models, even when they conceptually begin within a DSGE framework, add
in a variety of variables to increase forecasting accuracy. Having a model which matches moments
says little about forecasting accuracy. Especially when there is a deep downturn, governments
want to do something. Models constructed for analyzing small fluctuations are likely to provide
little guidance.
Governments make decisions about specific expenditures, and there is no reason to believe
expenditure multipliers associated with public investment that is complementary to private
48

That is, plausibly, the constraint may change with changes in policy and should be endogenously derived (see
Stiglitz and Weiss, 1986). In the short run, that often does not appear to be the case, so that the standard approach may
not be unreasonable for the development of benchmark models.
49
The limiting case of which is credit rationing—households or firms can’t borrow beyond a certain amount.

16

investment will be the same, e.g. as for public consumption expenditures. The former crowds in
private investment. But DSGE models are unlikely to be able to handle this kind of subtlety, which
is at the core of public policy discourse.
Conventional wisdom, partly based on the standard model, is that over time public deficits
designed to stimulate the economy lead to public debt, which can crowd out private capital
accumulation, harming growth. But that depends on a host of assumptions: (a) if the public
expenditure goes to public capital goods or human capital or technology which are complementary
to private capital goods, it can crowd in private capital accumulation; (b) in an economy at a zero
lower bound, the government can just print money to finance the expenditures. At such times, one
is often worried about deflation; any inflationary effects of such money-printing are thus
beneficial.
So too, the conventional insight that with rational expectations, multipliers will be low (zero)
because of the expectation of future tax increases depends on special assumptions: (a) if the
expenditures are for productivity-enhancing public investments, the conventional multiplier is
actually increased with rational expectations; (b) so too, if there had been the expectation of a
prolonged economic downturn; some of the “leakages” from spending today are reflected in
spending in future demand-constrained periods, increasing incomes in those periods; consumers,
taking this into account, spend more today than they otherwise would have spent. 50
With financial frictions, monetary policy may be relatively ineffective, not because of the zero
lower bound (if that were really the problem, changes in investment tax credits and consumption
taxes over time could have altered individuals’ marginal rates of substitution), but because
lowering the T-bill rate (or the Fed discount rate) may not alter bank lending much. If that is the
case, policies aimed more directly at increasing credit availability to those borrowers for whom it
is constrained may prove more effective than conventional monetary policy. 51
The central point is that there is a wide range of policies with significant macroeconomic effects
that governments consider, and we have to be able to tailor-make models—building off the core
model described earlier—to ascertain the effects. Many policies, for instance, may affect a
country’s exposure to shocks (full capital market liberalization); others may affect the strength of
a country’s automatic stabilizers. Having a simple model that can analyze these effects is crucial.
Building such a model from a DSGE framework is unlikely to be as helpful as building one from
the framework described above. 52

50

See Neary and Stiglitz (1983). So, too, the standard result on the inefficacy of debt-financed expenditures does not
hold if there are binding credit constraints and/or if there are life-cycle savers, who are unconcerned about tax
payments beyond their horizon.
51
These remarks may provide insight into the relative ineffectiveness of even the so-called non-conventional policies
in bringing the economy back to full employment. Without paying due attention to effects on banks’ balance sheets,
negative interest rates could even lead to reduce lending activity. We have already noted how these ideas did play a
role in the response to the 1991–2 recession by the Clinton administration. So, too, behavioral economics played an
important role in the design of the tax cut in the Obama administration.
52
As we have noted, DSGE models begin with the competitive equilibrium model. Variations in that model focused
on open economies therefore include an equation assuming uncovered interest parity (UIP). As Hendry and
Muellbauer (2018, this issue) point out: “There is strong empirical evidence against UIP. Evidence tends to suggest

17

The economy today is going through a structural transformation. The result may be that with
current levels and forms of government expenditure and taxation and private expenditures, the
economy might fall short of full employment. For all the reasons discussed above and others, the
adjustment to a full employment equilibrium may be slow. But even with sticky wages and prices,
there exists a set of fiscal policy interventions over time (taxes, expenditures) which could bring
the economy back to full employment in the short run, or at least bring it back to full employment
faster than would otherwise be the case: not just one, but a multiplicity of such paths, differing, for
instance, in their levels of public investment and growth in the short run. Even if one were
concerned about the level of debt, there is a balanced budget multiplier—and if the taxes and
expenditures are chosen carefully, that multiplier can be quite large. Thus, “secular stagnation”
associated with persistent unemployment is not a disease that happens to a country: it is a
consequence of policies that can be changed. Again, as we noted earlier, building from a DSGE
model, with its assumptions of common knowledge and rational expectations, is not likely to be
as helpful in designing policies responding to the structural transformation as beginning with a
model focusing on financial frictions, as described earlier. 53

V. Further critiques
One could go through each of the underlying assumptions of the DSGE model, to explain the role
they play—and why they result in a model that fails to predict and explain important aspects of
macroeconomic fluctuations, and why “reforms” which are supposed to improve economic
efficiency may actually increase macroeconomic volatility.

(i) On the importance of differences in beliefs
I have, for instance, alluded to the assumption of rational expectations. I strongly believe that one
cannot fully explain the growth of the housing bubble that played such a large role in the recent
crisis within a rational expectations framework. 54 But clearly, some of the “reforms” in mortgage
markets (strongly supported by the Fed Chair at the time) contributed to the creation of the bubble.
Differences in beliefs, too, can play an important role in macroeconomic fluctuations, through
what Guzman and Stiglitz call the creation and destruction of pseudo-wealth. When two
individuals differ in beliefs, they have an incentive to engage in a bet (or economic transactions
that for small deviations from long-run equilibrium in which purchasing power parity plays an important role, the
exchange rate is not far from a random walk, but for large deviations, equilibrium correction is important.”
53
In such structural transformation, differences in views are likely to be large, giving rise to the possibility of an
increase in pseudo-wealth, as described in the next section, and subsequent volatility. Financial structural reform,
allowing for more betting, will increase this volatility, and this should have been taken into account in evaluating the
benefits. Again, our critique of the use of rational expectations in such situations parallels that of Hendry and
Muellbauer (2018), who note: “Shifts in the credit market architecture are only one example of structural breaks and
evolutions, implying that the notion that the economy follows a stable long-run trend is highly questionable. . . .
Uncertainty then becomes radical. Structural breaks also make it hard to sustain the possibility of ‘rational’ or model
consistent expectations.”

which are similar to bets). Both sides, of course, think that they are going to win, so that the sum
of their “perceived” wealth is greater than “true” wealth. Until the bet gets resolved, there is an
incentive for both to spend more than they otherwise would, if necessary going into debt. The
resolution of the bet (the occurrence of the event) means that one side becomes wealthier, the other
side less wealthy; but there is more than just a transfer of income: there is a destruction in aggregate
wealth leading to a decrease in aggregate consumption. Pseudo-wealth is being created and
destroyed all the time, but certain changes—like the creation of new betting markets, e.g.
associated with “improvements” in finance, associated with the creation of markets in derivatives
and CDSs—can lead to significant increases in aggregate pseudo-wealth; and certain events, like
the collapse of the housing bubble, can lead to its net destruction. Fluctuations in pseudo-wealth
help explain one of the paradoxes of macroeconomics: the large fluctuations in the economy in
spite of small changes in the physical state variables, the stock of capital, labor, and natural
capital. 55,56

(ii) Aggregation
One set of assumptions that is critical, and to which too little attention is given in macroeconomic
analyses, concerns aggregation.
Long ago we learned the difficulties of constructing an aggregate production function. 57 The
“putty-putty” model provides great simplification, but one should not claim that any analysis based
on it is really “microfounded.” While earlier analyses provided a critique of the use of the standard
model for equilibrium analysis, e.g. when there is production of commodities by means of
commodities or when there are production processes involving capital goods of markedly different
durability; 58 the use is even more questionable for analyses of dynamics: the dynamics of puttyclay models and vintage capital models, for instance, are markedly different from those of puttyputty models. 59 It would thus be foolhardy to rely on the putty-clay model for any analysis of
dynamics in the short to medium term when such vintage effects can be important.
Even more important is perhaps the aggregation of the whole economy into a single sector,
particularly when the underlying stress on the economy is one of structural change, requiring the

55
There is ample evidence that individuals differ in their beliefs. Note these theories are consistent with each individual
believing that he has rational expectations—he is forming his expectations on the basis of all information available to
him. But they are not consistent with common knowledge, where everyone has the same beliefs. There can also be
“negative” pseudo-wealth, where what individuals believe they are going to pay to creditors is greater than the creditor
believes he receives. See Guzman and Stiglitz (2016a,b).
56
There are, of course, other possible explanations for this, e.g. sunspot theories, where there may be multiple
equilibria. In this short note, I cannot explain the relative strengths of these alternative explanations.
57
See Fisher (1969).
58
That is, the relationship between the value of capital (per capita) and output (per capita) may be far different than
suggested by the standard production function. For a review, see Stiglitz (1974).
59
For instance, if, during a period of low interest rates, firms install very capital-intensive machines (with a high
output per worker), it will be more difficult for the economy to return to full employment: the necessary increase in
aggregate demand will have to be greater than it otherwise would have been. See Morin (2014), Cass and Stiglitz
(1969). For a more popular discussion, see Aeppel (2012).

19

movement of resources from one sector to another (say agriculture to manufacturing), when there
are market imperfections (say in access to credit) impeding the reallocation. 60
Policy analyses are also likely to be misguided. Monetary policy is typically presented as an
efficient tool. But monetary policy has disproportionate effects on interest-sensitive sectors, thus
inducing a distortion in the economy that simply is not evident in a one-sector model (see Kreamer,
2015).
Finally, the use of a representative agent represents an aggregation of the household sector. It is
understandable that macroeconomists attempting to microfound macro-theory would want to
impose some restrictions: otherwise, any set of demand functions could be claimed to be
microfounded. 61 But assuming a representative agent goes too far, because it eliminates any
possibility that distribution matters. There is at least a significant body of thought that argues that
the increase in inequality played some, and possibly a critical role, in the build-up to the crisis and
to the slow recovery; there are large differences in the marginal propensity to consume between
the top 1 percent and the bottom 80 percent and, accordingly, anything that affects distribution
significantly affects aggregate demand significantly, i.e. has macroeconomic consequences. 62

VI. Going still further beyond the standard model
The microeconomics of the basic competitive model—as formulated in Arrow and Debreu—has
been shown to be flawed by 40 years of economic research. Why should we expect a
macroeconomic model based on such microfoundations to work? Most deeply, the standard model
is intellectually incoherent and implicitly encourages society to move in a direction which would
undermine both efficiency and well-being. It assumes that all individuals are purely selfish and yet
that contracts are always fully honored. Individuals who are fully selfish know that there are
enforcement costs, and will not honor their contracts fully, even if the consequence is a loss in
reputation. Thus, the Department of Justice and a number of private suits have uncovered the role
of pervasive fraud in the securitization process, by many if not most of the credit rating agencies,
mortgage originators, and investment banks, consistent with Kindleberger’s (1978) analysis of
earlier depressions and panics. 63 While incorporating such behavior in a standard economic model
is difficult, 64 the prevalence of such behavior is surely out of the spirit of standard DSGE models
60

Emphasized in the work of Delli Gatti et al. noted earlier.
That is, according to the Mantel–Sonnenschein theorem, in the absence of some restriction, such as the
“representative agent” assumption (where all individuals are assumed identical), virtually any aggregate function can
be consistent with the standard competitive model. See Mantel (1974), Sonnenschein (1972), and Kirman (1992).
There is also a large literature describing the very restrictive conditions under which such household aggregation can
be done.
62
Thus, the critique is far more than that the conditions allowing for such aggregation are not satisfied. That is
obviously the case, and the fact that it is raises, too, questions about claims that DSGE models are well microfounded.
63
Interestingly, there were provisions of standard contracts in the securitization process designed to mitigate the
consequences of moral hazard, but these provisions failed to work as intended, both because of widespread fraud and
breach of contract.
64
Though there have been some attempts to incorporate them and their implications into simple microeconomic
models, these have not yet been fully brought into macroeconomic analysis. One important variant of the strand of
61

20

and more consistent with those models emphasizing institutional arrangements to prevent such
behavior and the exploitation of imperfections of information. Surely, both policies to prevent a
recurrence of similar crises and analyses of market dynamics will need to take into account both
market and regulatory responses. Most importantly, the inculcation and normalization of a culture
of selfishness without moral bounds will lead to an economy that is less efficient with lower
individual and societal well-being. Behavioral economics has noted that most individuals
systematically behave differently from that model but that embedding individuals within a culture
of selfishness (where that is taken as the norm) leads to changes in behavior in that direction. 65
Macroeconomics is supposed to provide us with models of how the economy actually behaves,
rather than how it might behave in a mythical world of infinitely selfish people but among whom
contracts are always honored. Adam Smith, often described as the father of modern “selfish”
economics, in his invisible hand conjecture, 66 reminds us in his Theory of Moral Sentiments
(Smith, 1759):
How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his
nature which interest him in the fortunes of others, and render their happiness
important to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.
The earlier Smith was fortunately right, and modern macroeconomics should strive to incorporate
behavior which is consistent with these impulses, just as it does behavior that is consistent with
impulses that may be less noble. 67 One of the critiques of DSGE modelling is that it and its
underlying assumptions have become a dogma, with little incentive to call them into question,
especially in a context of peer-reviewed publications.

VII. Concluding comments
Assumptions matter. All models make simplifications. The question is, as we have said, what
simplifications are appropriate for asking what questions. The danger is that the simplifications
bias the answers, sometimes in ways that we are not aware of. The DSGE model ignored issues
that turned out to be key in the 2008 crisis; not surprisingly, the model neither predicted the most
important macroeconomic event in the past three-quarters of a century nor provided good guidance
as to the appropriate policy responses. Given the way the models are structured, they could not
have predicted such an event. In the run-up to the crisis, monetary authorities focused on inflation
rather than on what they should have been focusing on—financial stability; and some of their

standard macroeconomics does incorporate insights from one particular variant of financial frictions centring on costly
state verification.

66
A conjecture, which we noted, turned out to be false whenever there were imperfect risk markets and asymmetric
information, except in the very special conditions underlying real business cycle theory and its descendants.
67

see Greenwald and Stiglitz (1992).

21

(especially deregulatory) actions clearly contributed to financial instability. The DSGE models
provided them (false) assurance that they were doing the right thing.
Of course, any good macroeconomic model has to be dynamic and stochastic, and present an
analysis of the entire economy. But specific assumptions, as we have noted, went into each of these
components. We have already discussed several aspects of the assumed dynamics.
Some of the greatest deficiencies, I believe, relate to the treatment of uncertainty, the stochastic
element in DSGE models. We have already questioned the underlying presumption in the model
of how risks get dissipated through diversification, and that the underlying shocks are exogenous.
Also questionable are the typically unstated assumptions concerning risk management. There is
ample evidence that risk has first-order effects on firms, households, and banks that are not
adequately incorporated into the standard DSGE models. That is why those models had nothing to
say about one of the critical questions confronting policy-makers in the 2008 crisis: how best to
recapitalize banks. The objective was to enhance lending, especially to SMEs. The way chosen by
the US and some other countries, entailing the issuance of preferred shares, can be shown to be far
from optimal. There were other ways of bank recapitalization which would have led risk-averse
banks to lend more.
In this paper, we have provided many examples of insights that are revealed by simple
macroeconomic models with finite periods—insights that are typically obfuscated by the
simplifications required by DSGE modelling.
To me, small and big models should be viewed as complementary: one needs to use each to check
the results of the other. Perhaps there is some effect that got lost in the three-period simplification.
More often than not, it goes the other way. But it is not really a question of small vs big. It is a
matter of the careful choice of assumptions. As I have noted, sectoral aggregation is problematic
when the underlying macro-disturbance is that of structural change.
That having been said, our models do affect how we think: DSGE models encourage us to think
in terms of the economy always moving along a dynamic equilibrium path, and focus our attention
on intertemporal substitution. Neither, I suspect, is at the heart of what is really going on in the
short to medium term; and as I have suggested, the DSGE has little to say concerning long-term
growth. For instance, the belief in the effectiveness of monetary policy has led to the conclusion
that its current obvious ineffectiveness is only because of the zero lower bound: if only we could
break through that bound the economy could be restored to full employment. 68 Of course, if there
were a large enough negative interest rate—if people never had to pay back their loans—there is
little doubt that the economy could be stimulated. The question, though, is whether moderate
changes, from a real interest rate of say –2 percent to –4 percent, would have done the trick, when
much larger changes have proven ineffective. The reason for the ineffectiveness lies partly in the
fact that lowering the nominal interest rate on T-bills may not lead to a lower lending rate or that
68

This belief encouraged some central banks to move towards negative interest rates, with little success in restoring
the economies to robust growth. In some cases, the effects seem negative. Japan’s Central Bank was particularly
sensitive to the issues raised here (issues, as we have noted, that were not central in the DSGE models): they worked
to mitigate any adverse bank balance sheet effects while maintaining substitution effects.

22

lowering the T-bill rate may not lead to an increase in credit availability, as we have already noted.
But, as we have also noted, if one really thought that intertemporal prices were the crucial
consideration, one could have changed those through tax policies, through changing consumption
tax rates and investment tax credits over time.
In the end, all models, no matter how theoretical, are tested in one way or the other, against
observations. Their components—like the consumption behavior—are tested with a variety of
micro- and macro-data. But deep downturns, like the 2008 crisis, occur sufficiently rarely that we
cannot use the usual econometric techniques for assessing how well our model does in
explaining/predicting these events—the things we really care about. That’s why, as I have
suggested, simply using a least-squares fit won’t do. One needs a Bayesian approach—with
heavier weight associated with predictions when we care about the answer. Comparing certain covariances in calibrated models is even less helpful. There are so many assumptions and so many
parameters you can choose for your model, many more than the number of moments you can get
from the data; so being able to match all moments in the data does not tell you that your
assumptions were correct, and thus does not provide much confidence that forecasts or policies
based on that model will be accurate.
Defenders of DSGE models counter that other models did little better than the DSGE models. That
is not correct. There were several economists (such as Rob Shiller) who, using less fully articulated
models, could see that there was clear evidence of a high probability of a housing bubble. There
were models of financial contagion (described earlier in this paper, developed further since the
crisis), which predicted that the collapse of the housing bubble would likely have systemic effects.
The conviction that this would happen would have been even stronger had the data that the Fed
had available to it before the crisis also been available to the public. Policy-makers using
alternative models of the kind described here would have done far better both in anticipating the
crisis and coping with it than those relying on DSGE models.
Models have consequences even when their predictions and explanatory power are less than stellar.
For they affect how households, firms, and, most importantly, policy-makers think about the
economy. Models which say that the fundamental market failure arises from wage rigidities may
be induced to argue for more wage flexibility—to argue that if only we could achieve that,
economic performance would be improved.
This essay has argued that the standard DSGE model provides a poor basis for policy, and tweaks
to it are unlikely to be helpful. Fortunately, there are alternative frameworks to which modern
policy-makers can turn. I have tried here to describe some of the core elements that need to be
incorporated into the benchmark models with which we teach macroeconomics to our students.
The challenge we should be posing to them is how to develop increasingly sophisticated versions
of these into models, small and large, incorporating the various insights provided by a range of
“partial” models (such as that of the banking sector) that help us understand the important
fluctuations in our economy, and what more we might do to reduce their magnitude and frequency
and the human suffering that so often results.

Appendix: Core models for macroeconomic policy
The core models for macro-policy today focus on equilibrium today, and incorporate, in reduced
form, insights from recent advances in micro- and macroeconomics, taking on specialized form to
focus on one issue or another, one set of circumstances or another. Here, we focus only on closed
economy models and on the effect of various policies on output and employment.

(i) Constructing a bare-bones model
The bare-bones model begins with a neo-Walrasian model, attempting to incorporate the insights
of modern microeconomics into the basic aggregate equations, which are not meant to represent
the behavior of a representative individual, but the aggregation of many individuals. Accordingly,
a change in, say, a market variable will not only have income and substitution effects, but also
distributive effects.
Basic structure
The full model has three periods. Most of the analysis focuses on the middle period, labelled period
1, and how policies in that period affect outcomes in that period, identifying the interdependencies
between those policies, and the household, firm, and financial sectors. Thus, the model is a general
equilibrium model, but with a far richer set of interrelationships than characterizes the standard
DSGE model. We outline variants in which wages and prices are fully flexible, completely fixed,
and intermediate cases. But even when wages and prices are fully flexible, the market equilibrium
may deviate substantially from the “perfect markets” equilibrium because of imperfect capital
markets, which lead firms to be risk averse and which result in banks playing a central role. Thus,
knowing capital and labor supply in this period does not suffice to determine output and
employment.
Each period is linked both to the past and the future, and the other two periods (“zero” and “two”)
capture these linkages. What matters is not just firms’ capital stock but also indebtedness (financial
structure) and banks’ and households’ balance sheets. Thus, we show how shocks at time zero
affect these state variables at time 1.
The objective of bringing in period 2 is to more formally analyze households’, banks’, and
corporations’ intertemporal decision-making, e.g. as individuals weigh the marginal utility of
consuming today vs the value of a dollar in the future. It enables us to isolate, for instance, the
effect of an increase in future productivity on consumption today. This intertemporal problem—
in particular, the relevant Euler equations—is really at the center of attention in DSGE models.
The bare-bones model can be used to study these issues, but as we have suggested in the text, it is
almost surely wrong to put them at the center of macro-analysis.
Methodological remarks
The point of the bare-bones model is to help us understand better how changes in the environment
(in an agricultural economy, say, bad weather yesterday or today) or policy affect outcomes, and
24

the channels through which the effects are felt. While one could simultaneously incorporate
multiple deviations from the standard competitive model, this is not typically the most insightful
way to proceed. Rather, one wants to isolate, say, distribution effects, from balance sheet effects,
from the effects of capital constraints, from the regulatory constraints facing banks. We begin by
presenting a general model, incorporating many, if not most, of the effects discussed in the text
(and a few that we touched on only briefly). The real analysis, though, entails specializing this
general model.
Underlying the analysis are judgments about the relative importance of different “effects,” with
some effects being sufficiently small to be ignored—labor supply in the bare-bones models is
assumed inelastic at L*; but it is easy to elaborate on the model to incorporate wage effects on
labor supply, or even interest rate effects (though that is far-fetched). A key aspect of the analysis
is testing for robustness: do results change significantly if, for instance, there is a positive but small
labor supply elasticity?
The analysis begins by postulating that the aggregate demand for goods today, Yd, equals the
aggregate supply of goods, Ys, and the aggregate demand for labor, N, equals the aggregate supply
of labor, L. It then goes on to focus on key cases considered in the standard literature: for instance,
wage and/or price rigidity; and a no-shirking constraint in the labor market.
It focuses on policy, but not just on the effect of interest rates (which monetary policy is assumed
to control), but also on regulatory policy, and on government expenditures. But rather than
beginning from the hypothesis that consumption and investment demands are separable from
government expenditure, it recognizes that the form of government expenditure can affect either
variable.
Policy analysis proceeds by first solving the general equilibrium problem in a reduced-form oneperiod model—the endogenous variables (in particular output and employment) can be solved for
as a function of all the policy variables, P (given all the other relevant variables describing the
economy). It is then a straightforward matter to take the derivative of, say, output or employment
with respect to any particular variable, say a particular type of government expenditure. While the
resulting expressions are complex and will not be presented here, the analysis can be simplified by
assuming that most of the effects are small relative to a few upon which attention is focused. A
key difference between the model presented here and the standard DSGE models is that many of
the variables that are of first order importance are omitted from that model. The model here, by
contrast, pays much less attention to the intertemporal effects upon which the DSGE model
focuses. Some of the reasons for this have already been given; others are noted in the final remarks
of this Appendix.
The bare-bones model described below incorporates three effects missing from the standard DSGE
models: (i) distribution, (ii) banks, and (iii) credit constraints. One has to pay attention to not just
the values of average variables and their changes, but also to dispersion, and changes in dispersion.
Knowing that, on average, household wealth was large, with home equity sufficiently great that
default was not a significant risk, told one nothing about the state of the economy in 2008: large
fractions of households were in fact not able to make their interest payments. Thus, in an important
25

elaboration on the bare-bones model, dispersions in the relevant state variables (which need to be
more formally modelled than here) have to be introduced.
But even in the bare-bones model, we recognize that the relevant variables are aggregates among
heterogeneous agents, and that distribution matters. Thus, a lowering of the interest rate might
lower the income of retirees dependent on interest payments, and this distributional income effect
may be much larger than any individual substitution effect—including any effect in stimulating
investment, except through a collateral effect on credit-constrained firms.

(ii) Period 1
The key ingredients, aggregate demand and aggregate supply, are standard, but their determinants
include variables typically left out of DSGE models.
Aggregate demand
As in any standard model, we begin by describing aggregate demand 69:
Y d = C (N, w, p, r, rL , t, G, c, 𝔼𝔼, 𝛏𝛏𝐡𝐡 ) + I (w, r, p, G, c, 𝔼𝔼𝐟𝐟 , 𝛏𝛏𝐟𝐟 ) + 𝐆𝐆

(1)

where in the obvious notation C = consumption, w = wage rate, p = price level, r = T-bill rate, rL
= (nominal) interest rate at which individuals can borrow (about which we will say more below),
t = tax rate (assumed fixed), I = Investment, c = credit availability, G = government expenditures,
and 𝔼𝔼 represents expectations of the relevant variables (to be described below). G is a vector of
government expenditures, e.g. investment expenditures that are complements (or substitutes) to
private investment, consumption expenditures that are substitutes (or complements) to private
consumption. Aggregate demand is the sum of consumption, investment, and government
expenditures.
Consumption is affected by a variety of market variables, m ≡ {w, p, N, rL }, wages, prices,
employment 70 N and the borrowing rate rL ; a variety of policy variables P ≡ {r, t, G} set by the
government, the interest rate 71 r, the tax rate t, and (a vector of) government expenditures G; credit
constraints c, itself a function of market and policy variables; other variables 𝛏𝛏𝐡𝐡 : an individual’s
wealth, his liquidity, and his risk perceptions, and like c, these can be a function of both market
and policy variables; and his expectations of those variables, 𝔼𝔼. For instance, if individuals own
land, an increase in the interest rate, if it is expected to continue into the future, will lower the
value of land. 72 If households hold their wealth in stocks and bonds, consumption smoothing is
easy; if, as in many countries, much of household wealth is in the form of housing, households
69

For the moment, we drop time superscripts.
It is not assumed that individuals sell all of the labor they wish to. This is important.
71
Because some individuals may be lending (say holding government bonds) and others borrowing, both rates are
relevant. The standard DSGE model doesn’t recognize the distinction, and the fact that the rate at which banks lend is
an endogenous variable.
72
For instance, if T is land holdings, q is the price of land, the value of individuals land wealth is qT. q itself needs to
be solved for as part of the general equilibrium, a function of all the policy and state variables.
70

26

may suffer from illiquidity, so that even if they would like to smooth their consumption over time
by dissaving, it may be difficult for them to do so (except possibly by worsening liquidity in future
dates). Expectations are complex—especially in idiosyncratic environments (situations like the
Great Depression and Great Recession which have not occurred before, at least in the context of
an economy that is very similar to the current economy), and it is always difficult to ascertain
whether one is in such an environment. Thus, in a deep downturn, like the Great Recession, it is
hard even to know what one would mean by “rational expectations.” One might, for instance,
reasonably assume that if individuals save, some of the savings will translate into consumption in
a demand-constrained period, in which case, future wage incomes will increase, and that in turn
will lead to higher future consumption today. In short, it is reasonable to think of expectations as
being affected by current variables, but the magnitude (and in some cases even sign) of the effects
will not always be clear. 73 All of this can be embraced within the general representation above. To
the extent that there is a significant intertemporal substitution effect arising from changes in the
real interest rate, one has to model the effect of the market and policy variables on inflationary
expectations. In highly reduced form, where expectations themselves are taken to be endogenous,
we can write: C = C (m, P; 𝛏𝛏𝐡𝐡 ).

Similarly, the investment function can be related to the usual variables (with Tobin’s q being a
function of market and policy variables), with two additions: investment is affected by firm balance
sheets 74 (including liquidity) and may be credit constrained. 75 The credit constraint itself can be
thought of as being a function of the regulatory variables R as well as the behavior of banks (or
other lenders), itself a function of market and policy variables as well as the net worth, liquidity,
and expectations of banks {𝛏𝛏𝐛𝐛 , 𝔼𝔼𝑏𝑏 }. More formally, in the absence of credit constraints and the
expectation of future credit constraints, investment is given by I𝑑𝑑 = (w, rL , p, G, 𝔼𝔼𝑓𝑓 , 𝛏𝛏𝒇𝒇 ), and so
long as the firm’s liquid assets L ≥ I𝑑𝑑 – c, investment is given by I𝑑𝑑 . Hence, we can write: I = min
{I𝑑𝑑 , L + c} , where L itself may be a function of market and policy variables. 76 For simplicity, it
is often useful to focus separately on the cases where the credit constraint is and is not binding.
But this misses a key point: firm heterogeneity is important, and some firms may be credit
constrained, others not. 77
Aggregate supply
73
As an example of a complexity which is typically ignored, a lower interest rate today that leads to higher income
today with more savings implies that (everything else being constant) wages in the future will be higher. In a standard
putty-clay model, this means that firms will choose a more capital-intensive technology, implying that the increased
level of investment is higher than we might have expected using a putty-putty model. Standard DSGE models simplify
by assuming fully malleable capital. There are marked differences in dynamics (Cass and Stiglitz, 1969). While there
is some ex post capital labor substitutability, clearly ex post substitutability is much less than ex ante substitutability.
I have not seen a convincing argument that the economy behaves more like putty-putty than putty-clay.
74
As in Greenwald and Stiglitz (1993b).
75
As in Stiglitz and Weiss (1981).
76
Thus, if there were a liquid land market, the value of land (a function of its market price q) is an endogenous variable.
77
Thus, in the special cases of this general model focusing on this constraint, we begin with two classes of firms, one
liquidity constrained, the other not. But even this misses the more general point: the fraction of firms that are liquidity
constrained is an endogenous variable. By assuming a continuum of firms (with different balance sheets) we can
endogenously solve for the fraction of firms that are constrained.

27

Aggregate supply is a function of the same state, market, and policy variables, though it is natural
to assume that firms’ supply depends on wages relative to prices. The interest rate may be
important because it affects the cost of working capital. Again, balance sheets, risk perceptions,
liquidity, and expectations of all the relevant variables matter (unlike in the standard neoclassical
model). Thus, Ys = Y s �

w
p

, rL , 𝔼𝔼f , 𝛏𝛏𝐟𝐟 �.

Finance
rL, the rate at which the firm borrows, depends on the T-bill rate, but there is an endogenously
determined spread, affected by the state, environmental, and policy variables affecting banks and
their expectations:
rL = B( r, 𝐑𝐑, 𝔼𝔼b , 𝛏𝛏𝐛𝐛 ).

(2)

In particular, banks are a particular kind of firm that takes its capital, borrows additional funds,
and with these resources makes, monitors, and enforces loans, with the difference between the
lending rate rL and the rate at which it can get access to funds (here assumed to be r) generating
profits; it will charge a lower lending rate if it thinks that there is less risk, if its balance sheet is in
better condition, if reserve requirements or capital adequacy requirements are lower, etc.
Period 1 equilibrium with full flexibility
Thus, with full flexibility of wages and prices:

where Y is actual output.

Y = Ys �

w
p

, rL , 𝔼𝔼f , 𝛏𝛏𝐟𝐟 � = Y d

(3)

(2) can be substituted into (1) and (3) to obtain aggregate demand and supply as functions of the
T-bill rate r—but now the financial position of banks, their ability and willingness to make loans,
matters too.
With the capital stock fixed, the demand for labor depends on output, Y, and in equilibrium, this
equals the supply, which is assumed fixed: 78
N(Y) = L = L*.

(4)

Full employment output is determined by (4), and then, for any given set of policy variables, P,
expectation (functions) and other (state) variables 𝛏𝛏 , the level of real wages, w/p , must be such as
to ensure that Y* = Ys (note that Ys depends just on w/p). But given w/p, with Y* = Yd, equation
(1) determines nominal wages and prices. With fixed nominal debt, as wages and prices rise
together, aggregate demand increases. The real indebtedness of debtors decreases, and the net

Again, in the more general case, actual employment is the minimum of the amount of labor demanded and supplied.
The bare-bones model only considers the case where the demand for labor is equal to or less than the supply.

28

worth of creditors decreases. If the marginal propensity to consume (from an increase in wealth)
of debtors is greater than that of creditors—which we assume—the increase in consumption by
debtors more than offsets the decreased consumption of creditors. 79
There can be output variability in this model only as a result of shocks to the production function.
But a slight extension, allowing the labor supply to be a function of, say, the real wage L=L(w/p)
means that (2), (3), and (4) together solve for w/p, rL, and N; changes in state variables 𝛏𝛏 (both of
banks and non-bank firms) affect the endogenous variables {w/p, rL , N, Y}, and using (1), we can
solve for wages and prices separately.
By assumption, there is no unemployment, but shifts in the aggregate supply curve (changes in,
say, 𝛏𝛏 either of firms or banks) lead to changes in the employment level and output. Economic
variability is not just about shocks to the production function. And now policy affects the
equilibrium not just through standard Keynesian impacts on aggregate demand, but also through
shifting the aggregate supply curve (through (2)). Monetary policy matters, but not just through r,
but through regulatory variables, and operating both on demand and supply. What matters are not
just intertemporal substitution effects (which may be weak), but impacts on net worth of firms and
banks, and through credit constraints.
Specialized versions of the model focus on each of these, and on distribution effects. 80 A simple
two-class model (workers with life-cycle saving, and capitalists with long-term saving) can easily
bring out these first-order distributional effects.
In short, this bare-bones model can provide insights into the cyclical fluctuations which would
occur even in the absence of nominal wage and price rigidities.
Rigid nominal wages and prices
When there is a (nominal or real) rigidity, demand may not equal supply and then it is the short
side of the market that prevails:
Y = 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚{Y s , Y d } .

(5)

With nominal wages and prices fixed at w
� , p� , aggregate demand could either be greater or less
than supply.
79

In the representative agent model, these two effects cancel. There can be other effects, e.g. on expectations. If
investors believe that the increased inflation is not matched by an increase in nominal interest rates going forward,
then the expected real interest rate will be decreased, and this will stimulate investment. Similarly, an unexpected
increase in the price level could lead to more uncertainty about the future, with ambiguous effects on consumption but
probably adverse effects on investment (see Rothschild and Stiglitz (1972), Diamond and Stiglitz (1974)). If
differences in the marginal propensities to consume are large, and the increases in prices are modest, the consumption
effect is likely to dominate. The bare-bones model provides a framework within which one can discuss (and model)
the significance of these various effects.
80
Indeed, much of the recent macro-literature outside of the DSGE/RBC tradition can be seen as doing precisely that.

29

�). Thus, a temporary
Assume it is less. Then from (5), Y = Y d = �
Y, and employment is then N(Y
decrease in the interest rate could, as we noted, lower consumption, because the distributive effect
exceeds the substitution effect. If investment is credit constrained, and the value of, say, land used
for collateral does not change (much) in response to an announced temporary change in interest
rate (as one would expect), then investment would not change. A regulatory change that resulted
in banks making more loans would relax the credit constraint, and be more effective in stimulating
the economy and increasing employment.
Assume that there were some policies that could lower wages, without instantaneously lowering
prices. In a demand-constrained economy, that would lower consumption, even if it would increase
aggregate supply. 81 The effects on investment would be ambiguous, since (a) it would make
profitable older equipment that might not otherwise have been used; (b) it induces the use of more
labor-intensive technology, and thus, for every unit of future increased expected output, it induces
less investment; but (c) it makes investment overall more profitable. If the firm(s) are credit
constrained, the effect on investment would be zero. In short, there is some presumption that
aggregate demand and thus output and employment would be reduced. Even though wages are too
high, changing wages alone would have an adverse effect—a standard result in the theory of the
second best.
There would be long-run supply benefits once the economy was restored to equilibrium (or to a
supply-constrained situation.) The gap between aggregate supply and demand might accelerate
price adjustments. Whether one views the change as positive or negative then depends on the social
discount rate and the pace of adjustment to the full equilibrium.
But even the price adjustments might not (quickly) restore the economy towards equilibrium; in
the short run, matters might get worse. The increased indebtedness in real terms (with nominal
contracts) lowers both consumption and investment. Again, demand-side effects may dominate. 82
Efficiency wage unemployment
Efficiency wages put a constraint on the (real) wages that can be offered (the no-shirking
constraint). Similar results obtain in bargaining models.

lim φ′ = ∞.

L−N⟶0

(6)

Assume the product market clears, and that the constraint binds. Then:
w
p

81

w

= φ �N �Y s � p ���

(7)

In an open economy, to the extent that the lower wages led to lower prices, demand for exports would increase. But
even in an open economy, two-thirds of output is non-traded, so that the lowering of (real) wages of workers can
significantly lower aggregate demand.
82
This is modelling the Fisher–Greenwald–Stiglitz debt deflation effect.

30

yielding the equilibrium real wage (w/p)* and employment levels. Given the policy and state
variables, we can solve separately for the market variables {w, p}.
In this model (where we continue to assume aggregate demand equals aggregate supply), the
effects of policy again arise out of the aggregate supply function—which translates back into a
demand for labor: any change that increases the level of output (and thus the demand for labor) at
any real wage leads to lower unemployment. Thus, a lowering of interest rates lowers the cost of
working capital and thus increases aggregate supply—the willingness of firms to produce and hire
labor—at each value of w/p (given all other variables, such as 𝛏𝛏 ), and that leads to a higher
equilibrium real wage and a higher level of employment.
(iii) Extending the model back in time
The current state variables for households, firms, and banks are affected by what happened in
previous periods—including, of course, policies undertaken in previous periods. A model precisely
like the one just posited applies to time 0 (the period before the current one). We focus here first
not on the decisions in period 0, but on the effects of shocks in period 0 after decisions are taken
and on government policy responses. We omit the equations describing period 0, focusing only on
those linking events in 0 to state variables in period 1. There are two types of firms, those that
produce with a one-period lag (denoted by subscript a), and those that produce with no lag but
require capital goods (denoted by subscript b). For one type, what is important is working capital,
for the other it is physical capital. 83 For the first type,
W1,a = p1 Y1,𝑎𝑎 − �w0 N0,a − W0,a �(1 + r0,L ).

(8a)

The wealth (balance sheet) of a firm going at time 1 is total sales minus what it has to pay back to
the bank, which is the difference between its expenditures on inputs (which in this aggregate model
is just labor) minus its own wealth. In effect, in this simplified canonical model the firm takes all
of its wealth and uses it for its own production.
For the second type, in this simple model, capital lives only one period.
W1,b = p1 𝑌𝑌1,𝑏𝑏 − w1 N1,b �Y1,b, K1 � − (W0,b − K1 )(1 + r0,L ).

(8b)

Thus, current prices, past and current wages, the capital stock, previous period’s production and
investment decisions, and last period’s interest rates all affect this period’s wealth.

83

This formulation is important because one wants to have the aggregate supply curve depending on the interest rate
and balance sheets, which it does in the working capital formulation; but one also wants to have real investment (“I”)
(and aggregate demand) depending on interest rates and balance sheets.

31

Equations (8) thus explain how a shock at any date affects wealth and other state variables at later
dates. If prices this period are low (e.g. because of a demand shock), wealth will be low. That will
affect investment and production, that is, both supply and demand. The interest rate that matters
in equations (8) (and in equations (1) and (2) above) will be affected by shocks to the banking
system. In real terms, since debt contracts are fixed in nominal terms, banks are better off when
the price level is lower than expected; worse off if the default rate is higher, e.g. because of an
adverse shock to firms.
Thus, equations (8) give an additional mechanism through which government interventions, like
an increase in G, affect the economy: an increase in G increases p, increasing firm wealth and
decreasing firm bankruptcies, thus increasing bank wealth. This leads to an increase in firms’
willingness to invest and produce (i.e. a shift in the investment and production functions) and
banks’ willingness to lend (the availability of credit, if they ration, and the terms at which they
make credit available).
There are other linkages across time: an increase in investment in public capital increases demand
for goods at period t but increases productive capacities at t + 1. But if the public capital goods
(like roads) are complements to private capital goods (like railroads), then the increased investment
in public capital goods today increases the expected return to private capital goods this period, and
hence leads to more private investment at time t. The increased private and public capital stocks
then reduce the employment needed to generate any level of production next period, with
consequences that can easily be worked out.
One of the important insights of this approach is thus that aggregate demand and supply are
intertwined. Shocks to the economy and changes in policy are likely to simultaneously affect both.

(iv) Extending the model forward in time
Individuals and firms are always making intertemporal choices, which were in some sense hidden
in equations (1) and (3). As we noted in the text, while their decisions have consequences over
time (as the previous subsection illustrates), how they behave is an empirical matter, i.e. the extent
to which their decisions at any date are based on rules of thumb versus as if they solved a more
complex maximization problem, is a matter of some dispute. 84 Assume households and firms are
forward looking. For instance, in the case of households, we summarize the expected utility of
wealth carried forward to the next period (the solution to a complex dynamic programming
problem) by V(Wh,2 ; …. ). Then households maximize:

84

Indeed, with households in constant flux, with household formation and dissolution having first order effects on
well-being, and with household formation and dissolution both being endogenous variables, affected by economic
variables, it is clear that the standard model leaves out much that should be important in any real intertemporal
maximization problem.

32

U(C1 ) + 𝔼𝔼 �V(Wh,1 (1 + r) + (w1 N1 − C1 )(1 + 𝑟𝑟); … . )�

giving the Euler equation:

𝑈𝑈 ′ = 𝔼𝔼[Vw (1 + r)].

The heart of the analysis is not so much an enquiry into the effect of changes in r, but of changes
in uncertainty, with an increase in uncertainty (e.g. about future wages or employment) generating
precautionary savings. A fuller analysis would focus more explicitly on (a) aggregating over
diverse individuals, with wealth being redistributed as r changes; and (b) borrowing constraints
and imperfections in capital markets, taking into account the large disparity between borrowing
and lending rates. The latter means that for large fractions of individuals, consumption is driven
by their budget constraint: C = wN + rB B, where rB is the borrowing rate charged these
individuals, which is very loosely linked with r, if at all; and B is the borrowing limit; and for still
others, C = wN: because of the kink in the interest rate function, they neither want to be borrowers
or lenders.
A similar analysis applies to firms, where again the focus of analysis is on risk and how decision
variables affect future risk (including the risk of bankruptcy).
