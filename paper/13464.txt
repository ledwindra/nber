ABSTRACT
We study a simple, tractable model of labor adjustment in a trade model that allows us to analyze the
economy's dynamic response to trade liberalization. Since it is a neoclassical market-clearing model,
we can use duality techniques to study the equilibrium, and despite its simplicity a rich variety of properties
emerge. The model generates gross flows of labor across industries, even in the steady state; persistent
wage differentials across industries; gradual adjustment to a liberalization; and anticipatory adjustment
to a pre-announced liberalization. Pre-announcement makes liberalization less attractive to export-sector
workers and more attractive to import-sector workers, eventually making workers unanimous either
in favor of or in opposition to liberalization. Based on these results, we identify many pitfalls to conventional
methods of empirical study of trade liberalization that are based on static models.

Abstract.We study a simple, tractable model of labor adjustment in a trade model that allows us to analyze the economy’s
dynamic response to trade liberalization. Since it is a neoclassical
market-clearing model, we can use duality techniques to study the
equilibrium, and despite its simplicity a rich variety of properties
emerge. The model generates gross flows of labor across industries, even in the steady state; persistent wage differentials across
industries; gradual adjustment to a liberalization; and anticipatory
adjustment to a pre-announced liberalization. Pre-announcement
makes liberalization less attractive to export-sector workers and
more attractive to import-sector workers, eventually making workers unanimous either in favor of or in opposition to liberalization.
Based on these results, we identify many pitfalls to conventional
methods of empirical study of trade liberalization that are based
on static models.

Introduction.

This paper presents a model of labor mobility incorporated into a simple
trade model. The goal is to provide a general-equilibrium framework that is
rich enough to capture the main empirical features of labor mobility in practice
and yet simple enough to be tractable with the tools of analysis familiar to
trade economists. We thus hope that this framework can become a useful part
of a trade economist’s toolkit.

All aspects of an economy’s response to trade policy, and particularly the
distributional aspects, depend crucially on how labor adjusts, and the costs
workers face in doing so (see Davidson and Matusz (2004), Slaughter (1998),
and Magee (1989) for extensive discussions of the distributional implications).
However, for the most part trade theory has ignored the question of labor mobility, assuming either frictionless mobility or complete immobility. Moreover,
most of the few existing theoretical treatments of labor mobility are hard to
reconcile with key empirical features of labor mobility, in particular with the
evidence on gross flows. Here, we set up a model that takes on these questions
head on.
One can identify three ways in which trade theorists have handled labor
adjustment in trade models. First is the traditional static approach used as
a benchmark by many trade economists, which uses a model with ‘specific
factors,’ factors that cannot adjust at all, for analysis of the short run, but a
model with frictionless adjustment for analysis of the long run. Mussa (1974),
for example, uses the ‘Ricardo-Viner’ model for the short run, which features
instantaneous adjustment for labor but no adjustment for any other factors,
and the Heckscher-Ohlin model, which assumes no mobility costs for any factor, for the long-run. Of course, this approach offers no insight into dynamics,
and assumes away mobility costs for workers.
Second are explicitly dynamic models with only net flows, such as Mussa’s
(1978) seminal model of intersectoral capital adjustment, in which adjustment
is gradual because of convex adjustment costs for capital. A similar approach
has sometimes been adopted for labor, by stipulating convex retraining costs,
as in Karp and Paul (1994) and Dehejia (1997). A feature of these models is
that marginal adjustment costs are assumed to be zero when net movements of
labor are zero, and so the long-run steady-state is the same as in a model with
no adjustment costs (as in Heckscher-Ohlin). Dixit and Rob (1994) present
a model with a constant cost to switching sectors, equal for all workers, in a
stochastic environment. Feenstra and Lewis (1994) use a one-period model of
worker adjustment to study compensation policies. Matsuyama (1992) models
intergenerational labor adjustment.
All of the above papers have the property that all workers who switch
sectors move in the same direction: Gross flows always equal net flows. This
is a problem, since empirically gross flows of labor tend to be an order of
magnitude larger than net flows (see Artuç, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2007), or
Jovanovic and Moffitt(1990), Table 1). The third approach meets this difficulty
by adopting search models of labor reallocation to a trade model. Hosios
(1990), Davidson, Martin and Matusz (1999), and Davidson and Matusz (2001)
explore different aspects of this type of model, in which reallocation in response
to liberalization is gradual because it takes time for workers to find jobs in the
expanding sector. A survey of this approach with much discussion of empirical
evidence is Davidson and Matusz (2004).
What we do in this paper is to develop a perfect-foresight neoclassical
model of labor adjustment within a simple trade model, which does generate
2

gross flows in excess of net flows, as the search models do, but does so through
idiosyncratic shocks to workers’ mobility costs rather than through search.
This has the advantage that it allows us to use the powerful tools of duality
theory, well known in trade theory, to derive a wide variety of analytical results
not only about the steady state but also about the whole transition path. We
thus combine a desirable feature of the neoclassical models (duality) with a
desirable property of the search models (gross flows).
This is a simplified and more tractable version of a more general model presented in Cameron, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2007). The general version is
stochastic, can accommodate any number of industries and geographic regions
within the country under study, and has the virtue that its main parameters
can be econometrically estimated, as described in that paper. Here, we focus
on the implications of the model for trade theory in a simple two-sector special
case with one type of labor, which is simple and intuitive to use. A companion paper (Artuç, Chaudhuri and McLaren (Forthcoming)) studies the model
through numerical simulations, and Artuç, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2007) estimates the structural parameters of the model and simulates the adjustment
process.
The main results from this paper are:
(i) Gross flows of labor always exceed net flows, so there are always workers
moving across sectors, even in the steady state.
(ii) Equilibrium is unique, and there is no hysteresis, despite the presence
of an unavoidable fixed cost to switching sectors.
(iii) Wage differentials persist across locations or sectors even in the long
run, despite the fact that there are always some workers changing sectors.
In particular, cancellation of a sector’s tariff protection leads not only to a
short-run drop in that sector’s wage relative to the other sector, but also to a
(smaller but still positive) drop in its relative wage in the long run. Thus, a
frictionless model is not a good predictor for the steady state behavior of the
model.
(iv) The economy adjusts only gradually to changes in policy. This is
consistent with findings by Topel (1986), Blanchard & Katz (1992), and others.
This complicates empirical work on trade and wages, however, because changes
in wages and labor allocation will continue long after the change in policy has
occurred.
(v) The economy begins to adjust to a policy change as soon as it is anticipated. Evidence of this has been noted in data on trade agreements (Freund
and McLaren (1999)). This complicates empirical work even more, because it
means that adjustment begins before the policy change takes effect, and in fact
changes in wages can reverse their direction when the policy change actually
is executed.
(vi) The incidence of trade policy needs to be analyzed on the basis of
lifetime utility, taking worker mobility and option value into account, and not
simply on the basis of wage levels. We show how to do this. The correction
is important: It is theoretically possible, for example, for a policy change to
3

lower real wages in a sector both in the short run and in the long run, and
yet for the workers in the sector to be better off as a result of it, because it
raises those workers’ option value. This is far from being only a theoretical
possibility, as Artuç, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2007) show using US worker
data.
(vii) Announcing a trade liberalization in advance tends to reduce the
difference between its effect on export-sector workers and its effect on importcompeting workers. We show that this leads to worker unanimity in the limit,
meaning that all workers agree on the desirability of the liberalization if it
is announced far enough in advance. However, it is crucial to note that this
can have the effect in the limit of making all workers beneficiaries of trade
liberalization or of making them all net losers from it. Thus, the common presumption that a phased-in liberalization helps to cushion the blow to affected
workers can be exactly wrong in some cases. We offer a simple condition that
determines which way it will go.
Note that the hazards that these properties present for empirical work are
eliminated if one estimates the structural parameters of a dynamic model and
uses it as the basis for policy simulations. That is the approach taken in Artuç,
Chaudhuri and McLaren (2007).
Plan of paper: The following section lays out the basic model. Then one
section presents results on the steady state of the model, and the following
section presents results on dynamic adjustment. A further section discusses
the incidence of policy changes in the model, taking lifetime utility into account, and analyzes the effect of pre-announcement of liberalization on the
distribution of gains and losses. A final section summarizes.

2

The Basic Model.

There are two sectors, X and Y, each with a large number of competitive
employers, who combine a sector-specific fixed (latent) factor with labor for
production. The two sectors may be located in two separate regions and may
require different skills, making it costly for workers to move between them.
Without any costs of moving between sectors, and without any idiosyncratic
shocks to workers, the economy would be a Ricardo-Viner model (Jones, 1971).
We shall see that its equilibrium is very different from that model, both in its
dynamic character and in its steady state.
The economy’s workers form a continuum of measure L.

2.1

Production.

The quantity of aggregate output in sector i in period t is given by:
qti = Qi (Lit ),

4

where Lit denotes labor used in sector i in period t. Assume that Qi (·) is
increasing, continuously differentiable, and strictly concave.
The domestic price of good i, pi , is treated as exogenous. A central example, which will be treated explicitly, is of a small open economy in which the
domestic price is equal to the given world price plus a tariff (export subsidy)
for a good that is imported (exported). For now, we will assume that domestic
goods prices are constant over time, but later we will extend the analysis to
the case of an unanticipated or anticipated change due to a trade liberalization. Cameron, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2007) and Artuç, Chaudhuri and
McLaren (2007) allow for the more general case of a stochastic process for
domestic prices.
The wage in sector i in time t is competitively determined:
w
eti = pi

∂Qi (Lit )
,
∂Lit

where w
eti denotes the nominal wage paid by sector i at time t and pi denotes
the domestic price of good i. Thus, the competitive employers in each sector
each take the wage as given and maximize profit; the wage adjusts so that this
wage just clears the spot labor market in that sector.

2.2

Labor Mobility.

A worker θ who is in industry i at the end of period t receives a non-pecuniary
benefit εiθ,t . This can be thought of as enjoyment of the work or of living in
the region where industry i is located, for example. We assume that the εiθ,t
are independently and identically distributed across workers and sectors and
over time, with cdf F (·), pdf f (·), and full support:
f (ε) > 0∀ε ∈ <,
and mean zero:

Z
E(ε) =

εf (ε)dε = 0.

The cost to a worker θ, who was in i during period t, of moving from i to j 6= i
at the end of t is, then:
εiθ,t − εjθ,t + C,
where C ≥ 0 is the deterministic component of mobility costs, common to
all workers (such as retraining or relocation costs, or psychic costs of moving
to a new occupation). The variable εiθ,t − εjθ,t is the idiosyncratic component
of moving costs, which can be negative as easily as it can be positive. For
example, a worker may be bored with her current job and long for a change
in career (εiθ,t − εjθ,t < 0), and a worker with a child in the final year of high
school may have a non-pecuniary reason to stay in the current location rather
than move, as might be necessary to change jobs (εiθ,t − εjθ,t > 0).
5

Further, we make the boundedness assumption:
Z
X Y
E(max{ε , ε }) = 2 εf (ε)F (ε)dε < ∞.
This ensures that the worker’s problem is meaningful; if it was violated, the
worker could ensure infinite utility simply by choosing the sector with the
higher value of ε in each period.
Since what is important for workers’ decisions is the difference between εi
and εj , we can simplify notation by defining:
µiθ,t = εiθ,t − εjθ,t ,
for a worker currently in sector i, where µiθ,t is symmetrically distributed
around mean zero, with cdf G(·) and pdf g(·) derived from F (·) and f (·).
The transition equations governing the allocation of labor are:
j
i
miit Lit + mji
t Lt = Lt+1

i = X, Y ; j 6= i,

where mji
t denotes the fraction of labor force in j at the beginning of t that
moves to i by the end of t, or in other words, the gross flow from j to i.
The timing of events can be summarized thus:

The stock of workers in each sector in each period is determined by events
in the previous period. The current labor allocations together with current
product prices determines wages through spot labor-market clearing. Then
each worker learns her ε’s and decides whether to remain in her current sector
or move. In the aggregate, these decisions determine the following period’s
labor allocation.

2.3

Preferences and Expectations.

All agents are risk neutral, have rational expectations and have a common
discount factor β < 1. Further, all workers have identical and homothetic
prferences, which allows us to identify a common cost-of-living index. Letting
good X be the numeraire, let the cost-of-living index be denoted φ(pY ), an
increasing function that has an elasticity (by Shepherd’s lemma) equal to good

6

Y ’s share in consumption. Thus, the real wage wti received by a worker in sector
i at date t is given by:
1 ∂QX (LX
t )
X
Y
φ(p ) ∂Lt
pY ∂QY (LYt )
.
wtY (LYt , pY ) ≡ w
etY /φ(pY ) =
φ(pY ) ∂LYt

Y
wtX (LX
etX /φ(pY ) =
t ,p ) ≡ w

(1)

Note that an increase in pY will shift wtX down as a function of Lit and shift
wtY up as a function of LYt .
Each worker makes a location decision in each period to maximize the
expected present discounted value of real wage income, net of common (C)
and idiosyncratic (µ) moving costs. (Henceforth we will drop the workerspecific subscript θ, recalling always that the εt and µt terms are worker-specific
variables.) Let ui (Lt , εt ) denote the (maximized) value to a worker of being
Y
X Y
in i given Lt = (LX
t , Lt ) and idiosyncratic shocks εt = (εt , εt ) realized by
the worker. Then v i (Lt ) ≡ Eε (ui (Lt , εt )) gives the expected value of ui before
idiosyncratic shocks are realized, but conditional on (Lt ).
Since the worker is optimizing, ui (Lt , εt ) can be written:

ui (Lt , εt ) = wti + max{εit + βEt v i (Lt+1 ), εjt − C + βEt v j (Lt+1 )}
= wti + βEt v i (Lt+1 ) + εit + max{0, µit − µit },
where
µit = β[Et v j (Lt+1 ) − Et v i (Lt+1 )] − C,

(2)

and i 6= j. The expression µit is the common value of the net benefit of moving
from i to j. If this is greater than the idiosyncratic cost µ, the worker will
move; otherwise, the worker will stay.
Taking expectations with respect to the ε’s (and hence the µ’s):
v i (Lt ) = wti + βEt v i (Lt+1 ) + Ω(µit ),
where:
Z

(3)

µ

Ω(µ) = Eµ max{0, µ − µ} = G(µ)µ −

µdG(µ).

(4)

−∞

In other words, the value, v i , of being in i is the sum of: (i) the wage,
wti , that is received; (ii) the base value, βEt v i (Lt+1 ), of staying on in i; and
(iii) the additional value, Ω(µit ), of having the option to move. The expression
Ω(µit ) is thus interpreted as representing option value.

2.4

Key Equilibrium Conditions.

Y
An equilibrium is a moving rule characterized by a value of (µX
t , µt ) each
i
period (where a worker in i moves if and only if µ < µt ), such that the
aggregate movements of workers induced by that rule generate a time path for
wages in each sector that make the proposed moving rule optimal. Here we
derive a key equation that is useful in characterizing equilibrium.
From (2), together with (3) applied to period t + 1, we know that

j
j
i
i
C + µit = βEt [wt+1

] + βEt+1 (vt+2

)

j
i

but using (2) applied to period t + 1, this becomes:
j
i
C + µit = βEt [wt+1
− wt+1
] + C + µit+1

+ Ω(µjt+1 ) − Ω(µit+1 ) .

(5)

This is an important relationship for characterising the equilibrium behavior of the model. The interpretation is as follows. The cost of moving (C + µit )
for the marginal mover from i to j equals the expected future benefits of being
in j instead of i at time t + 1. This has three components: (i) the expected
j
i
wage differential next period, [wt+1
− wt+1
]; (ii) the difference in expected continuation values, captured by the expected cost borne by the marginal mover
from i to j at time t + 1, C + µit+1 ; and (iii) the difference in option values
associated with being in each sector, Ω(µjt+1 ) − Ω(µit+1 ).
Note that from (2), µX and µY are related:
Y
µX
t = −µt − 2C.

Given this and the symmetry of the distribution of µ, the equilibrium
reallocations of labor are given by the following relationships:

= G(µit )
t
mji
= G(µjt ) = G(−µit − 2C)

(6)

= G(µit + 2C).

As a result, the intersectoral allocation of labor follows the following law
of motion:
G(−µit )Lit + G(−µit − 2C)(L − Lit ) = Lit+1 .

Characteristics of the steady state

Here we will derive properties of the steady state, deferring discussion of
the path to the steady state until the next section.
In discussing steady states, we will naturally drop time subscripts. The
X
steady-state level of LX will be denoted L . In addition, we will let µ stand
for the steady-state value of µX , and so the steady-state value of µY is given
X
by −µ − 2C. Then L can be derived from (7) as a function of µ, and written
X
L (µ).
The first result is a uniqueness property:
Proposition 1 There is a unique steady-state level of µ and LX .
i

Proof. Because the mij and L derive uniquely from µ, it suffices to prove
uniqueness of the threshold µ. The value of µ is implicitly defined by the
equilibrium condition, which comes directly from (5):
µ+C =

(9)

it is easily shown that the right-hand side of (8) is continuous and strictly
decreasing in µ. Since the left-hand side is continuous and increasing on µ on
(−∞, ∞), there is a unique solution for µ.
This result demonstrates the striking difference that the idiosyncratic effects make for the behavior of the model. If there were only common moving
costs (C > 0) with no idiosyncratic shocks (µ ≡ 0), then there would be a
range of steady states. Any allocation of labor such that |wX −wY | < C(1−β)
would then be a steady state, and this would be a non-degenerate interval of
values of LX .
These differences are illustrated in Figure 1, which is the standard RicardoViner diagram adapted to our model. The length of the box is L, the downwardsloping curve is the marginal value product of labor in X, where the quantity
LX is measured from the left axis, and the upward-sloping curve is the marginal
value product of labor in Y , where the quantity LY is measured from the right
axis. All marginal products are deflated by the consumer price index φ(pY ).
The top panel shows the unique equilibrium for the Ricardo-Viner model, in
which there are no moving costs at all. The equilibrium point is marked as
9

X

LRV , where wages in the two industries are equalized. The middle panel shows
the range of labor allocations for which it would be unprofitable for workers
to move for a model with C > 0 but µ ≡ 0, thus the range of steady states for
a model with common, but not idiosyncratic, moving costs. Thus, in such a
model, there would be hysteresis: The value of LX at which the system comes
to rest would be determined by the initial conditions.
The bottom panel shows the outcome for the present model with both
common and idiosyncratic moving costs. In the present model with gross
flows, every year a trickle of people moves from one cell to another, and this
constant stirring of the pot eventually removes the effect of initial conditions,
yielding a unique steady state.
A second result, concerning wage differentials, makes it clear that the frictionless model does not predict behavior in the steady state of the model.
Proposition 2 In the steady state, the larger sector must have a higher wage:
X

L Q L ⇒ wX Q wY .

which yields a contradiction.
Thus, we can say that the long-run intersectoral elasticity of labor supply
is finite. Note that this implies persistent wage differentials, even in long-run
equilibrium, and even though in each period some fraction of the workers in
each sector move to the other. The point is that if a given sector is to be
larger than the other in the steady state, it must have a lower rate of worker
exit than the other sector does. In order for that to be the case, it must have
a higher wage. Put differently, suppose for the sake of argument that X and
Y had the same wage and µX = µY while LX > LY . Then the rate of exit
from each sector would be the same, so a larger group of X workers would
arrive in Y each period than the group leaving Y . This would put downward
pressure on the wage in Y , opening up a wage differential in favor of X, the
larger sector.
10

There is also an unambiguous relationship between the steady state of this
model and the Ricardo-Viner equilibrium (which, recall, is the equilibrium of
the model with C, µ ≡ 0). Specifically, the steady-state intersectoral allocation
of workers always lies somewhere between the Ricardo-Viner model and equal
division of workers between the sectors.
To see this, first let the allocation of workers to the X sector in the RicardoViner model, LX
RV , be defined implicitly by:
Y
Y
Y
X
wX (LX
RV , p ) = w (L − LRV , p ).

Proof. The result follows directly from the labor demand curves being
L
downward sloping and Proposition 2. Suppose LX
RV > 2 , which means the
demand curves cross to the right of the midway point as shown in Figure
X
1. If L were, in contradiction to the claim, to lie to the right of LX
RV , i.e.,
X
L
X
Y
X
< LRV < L , then w would have to be less than w . This follows from
2
the definition of LX
RV and the fact that the labor demand curves are downward
sloping. (Look at the diagram.) But that would contradict the earlier result
that the larger sector (in this case X) has to have the higher wage in steady
X
X
Y
state. We thus conclude that L < LX
RV ; but this also implies that w > w
(again, from the definition of LX
RV and the fact that labor demand curves slope
X
downward), so from the previous proposition, we must have L2 < L .
An immediate implication is that, unlike a frictionless model, the equilibrium does not maximize national income, even at domestic prices, and even in
the steady state. The reason is that each worker has non-pecuniary motives
as well as pecuniary ones, and this has its effect on the aggregate allocation of
labor. It is also clear that this is not an indication of market failure; workers
should consider their non-pecuniary motives when making their decisions.

3.1

Steady-state impact of policy changes.

Let us assume that sector Y is the import-competing sector, and that it
is initially protected by a tariff that raises the domestic price above the world
price. The following two results analyze what happens to steady-state labor
allocations and wages as a result of a change in the tariff.
First, the steady-state impact on labor allocations goes in the same direction as in a model with no mobility costs. For concreteness, consider two
11

Finally, as a last comparative static result, we note that wage differentials
induced by policy persist. When the tariff on Y is removed, not only does the
X-industry wage rise relative to the Y -industry wage in the short run, but as
Proposition 4 shows, it will also do so in the long run.

But we already know from the previous proposition that LN > LI , which
implies that µI > µN , given (9). This yields a contradiction.
In sum, the steady state of the model is unique and qualitatively different
from the equilibrium of a frictionless model. It exhibits persistent wage differentials in favor of larger industries, produces more evenly-sized industries than
a frictionless model, and does not maximize GDP. Now, we turn attention to
the whole time-path of adjustment.

4.1

Dynamic adjustment.
Preliminaries.

It is in analyzing dynamics and welfare effects along the transition path that
the tools of duality are useful for this model. Here we will see how. First, we
will show the optimization problem that equilibrium solves (as noted above,
it is not maximization of GDP). In the next subsection, we will see how that
establishes basic dynamic properties, and in the next section we will use it to
derive results on distributional effects along the transition path.
A general rule for labor allocation in this model could be characterized by
two functions. The function dXY (LX , µX ) gives the probability that a worker
in X will move to Y in the current period, given the current stock LX of
workers in X and the worker’s idiosyncratic cost µX of moving from X to Y .
The function dY X (LX , µY ) gives the probability that a worker in Y will move
to X in the current period, given LX and the worker’s idiosyncratic cost µY of
moving from Y to X. These functions define a feasible allocation rule if and
only if dij ∈ [0, 1] over the whole domain. For any given LX
0 , these functions
X
induce a sequence Lt for t = 1, ∞. The following proposition is proven (in
a more general form) as Proposition 1 in Cameron, Chaudhuri and McLaren
(2007):
Proposition 6 Any equilibrium maximizes:

given, and with Lt determined by the choice of the dij functions for i = X, Y ,

Therefore, studying optimization problem (10) can tell us about the equilibrium. Note that this is a dynamic analogue to the revenue function maximized
by equilibrium in a static neoclassical trade model (see Dixit and Norman
1980, Ch. 2). Let V (LX , LY ) denote the maximized value of the objective
13

function (10) from an initial condition of LX workers in X and LY workers in Y . Equivalently, since L is fixed, we can write the value function as
W (LX ) ≡ V (LX , L − LX ).
Since the problem is stationary, the usual dynamic programming logic will
apply, and the function W can be computed by solving a Bellman equation.

Bellman equation is then T (W ; pY ) = W . It is easy to show that T satisfies
the usual Blackwell properties with respect to W , and that as a result T has a
unique fixed point, which can be found as the unique uniform limit of iterations
on the Bellman equation starting from any bounded candidate function.
The following observation is helpful in characterizing the system’s dynamics, and is also proven as Proposition 5 in Cameron, Chaudhuri and McLaren
(2007):
Proposition 7 The function W is strictly concave.
This result tells us that the equilibrium is unique, since in strictly concave
optimization problems the optimum is unique. It also tells us that the function
W 0 (LX ) is strictly decreasing in LX . The following tells us that the value of
this function is always equal to v X − v Y , which is very useful for analyzing
dynamics, as will be seen shortly.
Proposition 8 In equilibrium at each date v X − v Y is equal to W 0 .
Proof. First, note that in the optimization it is never optimal to have
workers moving from i to j and at the same time other workers with lower
values of µ who are remaining in i. (In that case, an equal number of workers from the two groups could have their actions reversed, leaving the future
allocation of workers unchanged but reducing aggregate idiosyncratic moving
costs.) Therefore, in an optimal allocation there is for each value of LX at each
date a number µX such that dXY (LX , µ) = 1 if µ < µX and dXY (LX , µ) = 0 if
µ > µX . Simlarly, there is for each value of LX at each date a number µY such
that dY X (LX , µ) = 1 if µ < µY and dXY (LX , µ) = 0 if µ > µY . This means

14

that we can rewrite the Bellman equation as follows.

(13)

But then from (2), the result follows.
This tells us that in equilibrium, the attractiveness of either sector relative
to the other is a strictly decreasing function of the number of workers who
are located in that sector. Now we can use this to analyze the economy’s
dynamics.

4.2

Gradual adjustment to unanticipated changes.

The preceding analysis can be used to show a number of properties of the
model’s dynamic adjustment. First, labor market adjustments to any change,
such as terms of trade shocks or policy changes, will be sluggish. In particular,
suppose that the economy is in a steady state associated with an initial value
of pY , say p0 . If a one-time shock occurs (say, elimination of the tariff on good
Y ) that results in a new value of pY , say p00 , the economy will not reach the
steady state associated with p00 in finite time.
To see this, consider Figure 2. This illustrates the first-order condition
(2), or equivalently, (13), for choice of µYt and hence of LX
t+1 given the current
X
value of Lt . The solid upward sloping curve indicates the locus of points
Y

Y
X
X
X
(LX
t+1 , µt + C) such that Lt+1 = G(µt )(L − Lt ) + (1 − G(−µt − 2C))Lt ,
Y
X
which we can write as LX
t+1 (Lt , µt ). One can, thus, interpret it as the marginal
cost curve for the supply of X-workers: the height is the moving cost for the
marginal worker moving to X, given that the total number who wind up in X
at the end of this period is equal to LX
t+1 . The downward sloping curve gives
X
Y
0
X
β(vt+1 − vt+1 ) = βW (Lt+1 ). This can be interpreted as the marginal benefit
Y
X
of moving a worker from Y to X. Given LX
t , the values of Lt+1 and of µt are
determined as the intersection of these two curves.
Now, note that if C > 0, increasing LX
t by ∆ units shifts the marginal
cost curve to the right at each point by an amount strictly between 0 and ∆.
Since the marginal benefit curve is strictly decreasing, this implies an increase
15

in LX
t+1 that lies strictly between 0 and ∆. This can be summarized in Figure
X
3, which shows the transition function that gives LX
t+1 as a function of Lt .
Provided that C > 0, this curve must be strictly increasing, with a slope
strictly less than 1. Thus, there is a unique steady state, and if the system
begins at a point other than the steady state, it will move toward it without
ever reaching or overshooting it.
This provides the result. For example, if the system is initially at a steady
state with a high tariff that is expected to continue permanently, and then
the tariff is suddenly removed never to be restored, then the system will move
toward the new steady state each period, attaining it only in the limit.
Gradual labor-market adjustment to external shocks and policy changes,
and the persistent wage differentials that they imply, have been documented
empirically by, among others, Topel (1986), Blanchard & Katz (1992) and
Rappaport (2000). They appear in the model of Davidson and Matusz (2001),
due to re-training and search delays and exogenous rates of individual job
separation. They can also be rationalized by convex training costs for labor (as
in Karp and Paul (1994) or Dehejia (1997), in analogy with convex adjustment
costs for capital as in Mussa (1978)). Here, they result from the presence of
time-varying idiosyncratic shocks to workers (even though those shocks are
serially uncorrelated). Even if a worker is suffering low wages as a result of loss
of protection to that worker’s sector, it will often be in that worker’s interest
to wait until her personal moving costs are sufficiently low before leaving the
sector.

4.3

Anticipatory adjustment to pre-announced changes.

Another feature of the model’s dynamics is anticipatory adjustment. Suppose the economy is in an initial steady state with a tariff on imported good Y ,
and a domestic price of pY = p0 . At time t = 0, the government announces a
surprise policy change—elimination of the tariff—starting at some date t∗ > 0.
At that date and thenceforth, the domestic price of Y will be equal to the world
price, p00 < p0 . We will see that anticipatory net outflows of labor from sector
Y will begin immediately from the time of the announcement.
Although the environment is no longer stationary as in the previous sections, the logic of Proposition 6 still applies, and the perfect-foresight equilibrium still solves the planner’s problem (10) with pY = p0 for t = 0, . . . , t∗
and pY = p00 for t > t∗ . The value function will, however, depend on the
date as well as the current labor allocation, and it is useful to write it as
W t (LX ; p0 , p00 , t∗ ) to keep track of the parameters of the problem.
Note from (1) that ceteris paribus, a rise in pY will raise the real wage in the
Y sector and lower it in the X sector, or w2X (LX , pY ) < 0 and w2Y (L−LX , pY ) >
0. This leads to the following.

(i) Comparing p0 with p00 , (13) shows that the optimal choice of µYt for a
given LX
t will be the same for both. This implies that the only difference in
(14) is in the first two terms, which take a higher value for p00 since the X
wage is higher and the Y wage is lower. This proves the result. (ii) If we

replace W

T (W ; p )(Lt ), the marginal benefit curve shifts up (recall Figure 2). Thus,
Y
for any LX
t , we have a rise in the value of µt that is chosen. The first two terms
of (14) are unchanged. The derivative of the last three terms with respect to
µYt is equal to −G(−µYt − 2C) − G(µYt ) + 1, which by the symmetry of the
distribution of µ is equal to G(µYt + 2C) − G(µYt ) > 0. Therefore, the value of
(14) has gone up, proving the result.
Now, consider a model in which pYt ≡ p0 forever and call it model I (for
‘initial’), with value function W I and steady-state value of LX equal to LX
I .
00
Y
Consider in the same way a model in which pt ≡ p forever and call it model N
(for ‘new’), with value function W N and steady-state value of LX equal to LX
N.
The two comparative statics results just derived, applied to the recursions on
the Bellman operator T , imply that W1I (LX ) < W1N (LX ) for any LX ∈ [0, L],
X
and that LX
I < LN .
Now, return to the problem of the model with the announced policy change
at time t∗ . From time t∗ on, the value function and the transition function

mapping LX
t into Lt+1 and will be exactly as they are in model N . Consider
date t∗ − 1. For a given value of LX , the value function for date t = t∗ − 1
is given by T (W N ; p0 )(LX ) (the next–period value function is W N , but the
current value of pY is p0 ). By the lemma, we can conclude:
W1I (LX ) <

∂T (W N ; p0 )(LX )
< W1N (LX )
∂LX
t

(15)

for any LX . The first inequality results from part (ii) of the Lemma because
W I = T (W I ; p0 ), and W1I < W1N . The second inequality results from part (i)
17

of the Lemma because p0 > p00 . However, referring again to the first-order
X
condition for the choice of LX
t+1 given Lt (see Figure 2), we see that (15)
implies that the transition function for period t∗ − 1 lies strictly in between
the transition function for model I and that for model N. This is illustrated
in Figure 4. By the same logic, the transition function for period t∗ − 2 must
lie strictly between that for t∗ − 1 and that for model I, and so on. Then
if we were already in a steady state of model I and it was announced (to
everone’s surprise) at date 0 that the tariff would be removed at date t∗ , the
dynamics of the system would follow the path indicated in Figure 4, drawn for
the assumption that t∗ = 3. Adjustment toward the new steady state would
begin immediately at date 0, and would continue permanently, always moving
toward the new steady state but never reaching it.
Of course, anticipatory labor adjustments also imply anticipatory wage
changes. In particular, anticipatory outflows from Y prior to the actual tariff
removal will progressively raise wY up to the time of the policy change, at
which point it will fall discretely, and will progressively push down wX up to
the time of the policy change, at which point it will rise discretely due to the
drop in the consumer’s price index. This has obvious implications for empirical
analyses of the impact of trade liberalization on wages.
In particular, suppose that a researcher obtains data on wages and employment levels at dates t∗ − 1 and t∗ + 1, and compares the values before and after
the liberalization. If the differences thus observed are interpreted to be the
effects of the liberalization, then because the anticipatory effects are omitted,
the study will greatly overestimate the wage effects and underestimate the
sectoral employment effects.

5

Welfare and Incidence.

A large part of the reason for studying the workings of a model with labor
mobility costs is to refine our understanding of who gains and who is hurt
from a change in trade policy. Here we will look at two different angles of
this question. First, a simple envelope result shows how the effect on a given
worker can be expressed in terms of flow probabilities and changes in wages
only. This result shows the importance of gross flows in analyzing incidence,
which is ignored in the vast majority of empirical work. Second, we derive
some results on how delayed trade liberalization can affect who gains and who
loses from a reform.

5.1

An envelope result.

Return again to the case with constant pY . Consider again an unannounced
and permanent change in tariff, which changes the value of pY once and for
18

all. Returning to (3), we can see that the change in the utility of a worker in
sector i would be:
i∗
Y
dvti∗ /dpY = dwti∗ /dpY + βdvt+1
/dpY + Ω0 (µit )dµi∗
t /dp ,

where wti∗ , vti∗ and µi∗
t denote the equilibrium values of the wage, worker’s
utility, and moving threshold in sector i and at date t respectively. Noting
that Ω0 (µ) = G(µ), this means:
j∗
i∗
i∗
/dpY + G(µit )β[dvt+1
/dpY ], or
/dpY − dvt+1
dvti∗ /dpY = dwti∗ /dpY + βdvt+1
j∗
i∗
dvti∗ /dpY = dwti∗ /dpY + βdvt+1
/dpY (1 − G(µit )) + βG(µit )dvt+1
/dpY .

Recalling (6) and following the recursive logic forward, this becomes:
dvti∗ /dpY

where πtik is the probability that a worker who was in i at time 0 will be in k
at time t. Thus, despite the moving costs, a properly constructed discounted
sum of wages alone, using gross flows to average across sectors, is sufficient for
evaluating incidence.
Note again that this has implications for empirical work. It suggests that
looking at change in an industry’s wages is not enough to tell whether workers
in that industry have benefitted or not. In particular, it is quite possible to
construct examples in which a drop in tariff lowers wages in sector Y in the
short run and in the long run, and yet every worker in the economy, benefits,
including those in Y .2 The reason is that real wages in X rise by enough,
and the economy is fluid enough, that current Y workers expect to make up
in future employment in X for what they have lost in Y . This also stands in
stark contrast to the convex-adjustment cost approach (Karp and Paul, 1994;
Dehejia, 1997); in equilibrium in those models, a Y -worker must be indifferent
between leaving Y and remaining there permanently, and so would definitely
be worse off if Y wages were to fall permanently.

5.2

The effects of policy delay on incidence.

Trade liberalization measures are usually phased in over time. For example,
the elimination of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement in the Uruguay round was
2

For example, consider a model with Ricardian technology. If Qi (Lit ) ≡ Ai Lit for positive
constants Ai , i = X, Y , then wX = AX /φ(pY ) and wY = pY AY /φ(pY ). Suppose that the
two goods are perfect substitutes in consumption so that φ(pY ) ≡ min{1, pY }. Then for
pY > 1, wX = AX and wY = pY AY , while for pY ≤ 1, wX = AX /pY and wY = AY . Then
if pY is initially slightly above 1 but then drops to a point well below 1, wY will fall slightly
but by letting pY fall sufficiently close to 0, wX can be made arbitrarily large. Eventually,
Y -workers will value the option of moving to X enough to compensate them for their small
current wage loss.

19

scheduled to be phased in over ten years, with most of the reduction loaded
at the end of the phase-in period. One reason for this is to soften the effects
of the reform on workers likely to be hurt by it, giving them time to adjust
and perhaps removing an incentive to oppose the reform politically. This
motive is studied by Dehejia (2003), in a Heckscher-Ohlin model with convex
adjustment costs for workers (and zero steady-state flows of workers). In that
model, it is shown that gradual phase-in can bring all workers behind a trade
liberalization that would otherwise have been opposed by import-competing
workers, making the reform politically feasible.
We will here study the effect of delayed trade liberalization in the present
model. To study a simple version of the problem that makes the mechanisms
clear, we focus on a stark liberalization that brings the economy from autarchy
to free trade. Beginning from an autarchic steady state, the opening of trade
may either occur immediately or be announced (with full commitment) to
occur at a later date. In contrast to Dehejia, we find that delay does not, in
general, soften the blow of trade liberalization to workers. What it does do,
if the period of delay is long enough, is to unite all workers, so that they all
either benefit from trade or lose from it. To anticipate, it turns out that if
an increase in labor supply increases the economy’s long-run relative supply
of export goods (as it does in Dehejia’s model), then delay fosters unification
of workers behind free trade, but if an increase in labor supply decreases longrun relative supply of export goods, delay fosters unification of workers in
opposition to free trade.
Consider an economy that is as of period 0 in an autarchic steady-state
with a relative price of good Y given by p = p0 . At date 0 it is announced that
the economy will be opened up to free trade as of date t∗ (which could be equal
to zero, representing the case of unanticipated liberalization). Suppose that
the world relative price of good Y is given by p = p00 . It is useful to rewrite the
period-t value function for the planner’s problem that the equilibrium solves as
0 00 ∗
Y
W t (LX
t , Lt ; p , p , t ). (Of course, the value function is not stationary before
∗
t , although it will be afterward, hence the time superscript for the value
function.) Let t∗ = ∞ represent the case in which no trade liberalization is
announced.
It is straightforward to check from the envelope theorem applied to the
Bellman equation for the planner’s problem that the payoff to an individual worker in the X sector at the beginning of period 0, just after the polY
0 00 ∗
icy announcement, is equal to v0X = W10 (LX
t , Lt ; p , p , t ), or the marginal
value of an X worker from the planner’s point of view. Similarly, the payoff to a Y worker is given by v0Y = W20 . Given that, the question of the
value of advance notice is essentially the question of whether or not an inY

(iv) Lit1 → Li∞1 as t → ∞, for i = X, Y .

Parts (i) and (iv) are technical preliminaries. The result in (iv) requires
proof, since even when a series of functions converges uniformly to a limit function, in general the sequence of derivatives does not converge to the derivative
of the limit series. In this case the result follows because the functions are
solutions to an optimisation problem. Parts (ii) and (iii) follow directly from
the model’s dynamics. For example, if one was to add some workers to X in
period 0, that would result in more X workers in each period, but the number
of X workers would fall over time, as workers reallocate toward the Y sector.

With a slight abuse of notation, we will write LX
01 = 1, L02 = 0, L01 = 0, and
Y
L02 = 1.
Henceforth, we will assume that the planner’s value function is twice continuously differentiable in all arguments.
With this notation, the effect on the payoff of a worker in X is:

where α ≡ p0 φ0 (p0 )/φ(p0 ) is the share of good Y in autarchic consumption

delay; the only effect of an increase in t∗ on this exression is to eliminate some
to the terms from the summation. This is the key to the results that follow.

Since QX
t1 is decreasing in t and Qt1 is increasing in t, Bt is increasing
α
in t. Since p0 (1−α) is the autarchic steady-state ratio of Y consumption to X
consumption (and
the

labor in one sector cannot have a contemporaneous effect on output in the
other sector. Thus, B0 < 0.
∂v X
As a result, if B∞ < 0, then Bt < 0 for all t, and ∂p000 |p00 =p0 < 0. However, if
B∞ > 0, then Bt is negative for t below some threshold and positive for t above
∂v X
the threshold. The implication is that ∃t such that if t∗ ≥ t, ∂p000 |p00 =p0 > 0.

t2 and Qt2 are non-negative for all
t, we can conclude that D0 > 0 and that Dt is decreasing in t. Further, by
part (iv) of the lemma and the uniqueness of the steady state which implies
X
Y

that LX
∞1 = L∞2 and L∞1 = L∞2 , we conclude that D∞ = B∞ . This all
implies that Bt < Dt for all t. Given that B0 < 0 < D0 , we conclude that

∂v Y

By extension of the logic just used, if D∞ < 0, then ∃t such that if t∗ ≥ t,

In addition, since B0 < 0 < D0 , it is clear that increasing t∗ from 0 to 1, by
chopping off a term that is negative in the first case and positive in the second,
∂v Y
∂v X
increases ∂p000 |p00 =p0 and decreases ∂p000 |p00 =p0 . Thus, workers in the export sector
are hurt by a bit of delay, while workers in the import competing sector benefit
from a bit of delay.
This can all be summarized as follows. The first proposition treats the case
with B∞ = D∞ 6= 0, and the second treats the case with B∞ = D∞ = 0.

The switch in the order of differentiation is analogous to the demonstration that in a
static trade model derivatives of factor prices with respect to output derivates is dual to the
derivative of output with respect to factor prices, as in Dixit and Norman (1980, pp.54-55).

Proposition 9 Suppose that, at the autarchy relative price p0 , steady state
relative supply of the export good is increased [decreased] by an increase in
labor supply. Then, there is an open interval containing p0 such that if the
world price p00 is in that interval:
(i) Workers in the export [import-competing] sector as of period 0 will benefit from [be hurt by] immediate unanticipated opening of trade.
(ii) The net benefit to workers in the import-competing sector from the
opening up of trade is strictly less than the benefit to export sector workers,
whether the opening is delayed or not.
(iii) A one-period delay hurts export-sector workers and benefits importcompeting workers.
(iv) A sufficiently long delay before the opening of trade will make workers
in both sectors net beneficiaries [net losers] from trade.
Proposition 10 Suppose that, at the autarchy relative price p0 , steady state
relative supply of the export good is unchanged at the margin by an increase
in labor supply. Then there is an open interval containing p0 such that if the
world price p00 is in that interval:
(i) Workers in the export sector as of period 0 will benefit from the opening
of trade, whether it is delayed or not.
(i) Workers in the import-competing sector as of period 0 will be hurt by
the opening of trade, whether it is delayed or not.
(iii) A one-period delay hurts export-sector workers and benefits importcompeting workers.
Some examples. Four simple special cases illustrate the different effects
delay can have. For all examples, assume that p00 < p0 , so that Y is the
import good, and that the difference between the world price and the domestic
autarchy price is small enough that the propositions apply. (As a result, sector∂v i
i workers benefit from trade if ∂p000 |p00 =p0 < 0.)
(i) Ricardian technology. If Qi (Lit ) ≡ Ai Lit for positive constants Ai , i =
X, Y , an increase in total labor supply will result in an equiproportionate
increase in output of both sectors. (Note that wX and wY are both independent
of labor supplies, and so, by (8), µ is unchanged by a change in labor supply.)
Therefore, B∞ = 0, and in this case delay has no role: export sector workers
benefit from trade and import-competing workers are hurt by it, regardless of
t∗ .4
(ii) Inelastic import-competing labor demand. Suppose that both X and Y
are produced by a sector-specific asset in fixed supply (K X and K Y respectively) together with labor. Suppose further that the production function for Y
is Leontieff: QY (K Y , LY ) = min{K Y , LY }, and that the production function
Recall that these are ‘local’ results, in the sense that they depend on p00 being close to
p . On the other hand, where p00 is substantially below p0 , workers in both industries can
benefit from trade (even though the real wage for sector Y falls both in the short run and
the long run), as illustrated in Footnote 2.

for X is CES: QX (LX , K X ) = ((LX )ρ + (K X )ρ )1/ρ , with ρ < 1, ρ 6= 0 (implying
an elasticity of substitution equal to 1/(1 − ρ)). In this case, QYt1 = QYt2 = 0∀t.
Therefore, Bt , Dt ≤ 0∀t, with strict inequality for t > 0, so both groups of
worker will benefit from trade with or without delay. The interpretation is
that the increased labor demand in the export sector forces wages up in the
import-competing sector because of its inelastic labor demand, benefitting all
workers.5
(iii) Inelastic export-sector labor demand. Now, reverse the production
X
functions for the two sectors. In this case, QX
t1 = Qt2 = 0∀t. Therefore,
Bt , Dt ≥ 0∀t, with strict inequality for t > 0, so both groups of worker will be
hurt by trade with or without delay. The interpretation is that the reduced
labor demand in the import-competing sector forces wages down in the export sector because of its inelastic labor demand, hurting all workers. In this
example, all of the gains from trade are captured by the owners of the fixed
factors.
(iv) An example in which delay tips the scales in favor of trade. Now coni

i
sider a general CES specification, in which Qi (Li , K i ) = ((Li )ρ + (K i )ρ )1/ρ ,
i = X, Y , with ρi < 1, ρi 6= 0. Example (ii) shows that with any finite ρX
and with ρY sufficiently large and negative, import-competing workers strictly
benefit from an unannounced liberalization. Example (iii) shows that with
any finite ρY and with ρX sufficiently large and negative, import-competing
workers are strictly hurt by an unannounced liberalization. Choose any two
such parameter pairs, and connect them with a curve in (ρX , ρY ) space. There
must be a point on the curve at which import-competing workers are indifferent between a sudden trade opening and the autarchic steady state. For this
parameter pair, by part (ii) of Proposition 9, export workers are strict beneficiaries of sudden trade. In addition, export workers will remain net beneficiaries of trade if the opening is delayed (B∞ must be negative, because in order
for Y workers to be indifferent, D∞ must be negative; but then Bt < 0∀t).
Furthermore, since D0 > 0 and Dt is decreasing in t, any delay will make
the Y workers strict beneficiaries of trade. Thus, an immediate liberalization
would benefit X workers but not Y workers, but a delayed liberalization would
strictly benefit both classes of worker. (A slight perturbation of the (ρX , ρY )
pair could then make the Y workers stictly hurt by immediate trade opening,
making them strict beneficiaries of delayed opening.)
The interpretation of this result is as follows. An unexpected trade opening
pushes down the real wages of Y workers immediately, while pushing up the
real wages of X workers. The Y workers move only gradually to take advantage
of the higher X wages because of the moving costs. However, if the trade
opening is announced in advance, Y workers who happen to have low moving
costs at the moment begin moving to X in anticipation. This makes Y workers
more scarce, pushing up wages for those who do not move (while pushing X

This is analogous to a parallel result on the role of elasticities of substitution in Mussa’s
(1974) static Ricardo-Viner model.

24

wages down), even though no change in output prices has yet occurred. If the
elasticity of labor demand in the Y sector is sufficiently low, this anticipatory
wage increase is the dominant effect.
(v) An example in which delay tips the scales against trade. Exactly the
same logic as in (iv) can be used to construct a case in which export sector workers are indifferent between immediate trade and the autarchic steady
state. In this case, by part (ii) of Proposition 9, import-competing workers are
strictly hurt by trade whether it is delayed or not (since D∞ must be positive,
because in order for X workers to be indifferent, B∞ must be positive; but
then Dt > 0∀t). Furthermore, since B0 < 0 and Bt is increasing in t, any
delay will make the X workers strictly harmed by trade. Thus, in the event of
an immediate liberalization, workers would be divided over trade, while delay
would unite all workers in their opposition. (Again, a slight perturbation of
the example can make X workers strict beneficiaries of immediate trade.)
The interpretation of this example is as follows. From the point of view of
the X workers, immediate trade has three effects. It lowers real wages in the
Y sector; it provides an immediate increase in real wages in the X sector; and
it pushes a certain number of Y workers out of the Y sector and into the X
sector over time, pushing X wages down. If labor demand in X is sufficiently
inelastic, the X wage will be lower in the long run than it was under autarchy.
Thus, in this example, for a X worker, the benefit from free trade is short-lived,
and must be weighed against a long-run cost. On the other hand, if the trade
opening is announced in advance, Y workers begin moving into X right away,
pushing X wages down even before output prices change. Thus, X workers lose
the benefit of the short-run wage increase that they would have enjoyed under
unanticipated trade, and jump immediately to the long-run cost of increased
competition from former Y workers.
These examples serve to illustrate the range of possible outcomes. Except
in the knife-edge case with B∞ = D∞ = 0, delay tends to make workers
unanimous in their stance toward trade, but whether it is a positive or negative
stance depends on the relative responsiveness of labor demand in the two
sectors. Of course, whether delay in any given real world liberalization event
is likely to turn workers into beneficiaries or victims of trade is an empirical
matter. Artuç, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2007) simulate equilibria of this
model for a range of parameters in order to illustrate these points and to
explore the magnitudes of delay required to achieve unanimity of workers. For
middling values of the elasticity of substitution, unanimity can require decades
of delay.

Conclusion.

We have studied a simple trade model with costly labor mobilty and idiosyncratic moving-cost shocks. The model is shown to have non-trivial dynamics,
including gradual adjustment and anticipatory effects, resulting solely from
25

fixed moving costs plus time-varying idiosyncratic moving cost shocks to individual workers. A key conclusion is that the steady state does not resemble a
model with frictionless labor mobility. Specifically, intersectoral wage differentials persist permanently, making workers more expensive in larger sectors. In
addition, trade liberalization lowers the long-run wage in the import-competing
sector relative to the export sector, and delaying liberalization reduces the
difference between the effect of liberalization on export-sector and on importcompeting workers.
Thus, the trade economist’s habit of assuming that a frictionless model will
be a good predictor of long-run trade effects is called into question.
