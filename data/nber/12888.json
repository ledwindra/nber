    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper discusses some recent advances in the area of culture and economics and examines the effect of culture on a key economic outcome: female labor supply.  To separate the effect of market variables and institutions from culture, I use an epidemiological approach, studying second-generation American women.  I use both female LFP and attitudes in the women's country of ancestry as cultural proxies and show that both cultural proxies have quantitatively significant effects on women's work outcomes.  The paper concludes with some suggestions for future empirical and theoretical research topics in this area.\n\n",
