    "abstract": "\n\nManagement risk occurs when uncertainty about future managerial decisions increases a firm\u2019s overall risk. This paper argues that management risk is an important yet unexplored determinant of a firm\u2019s default risk and the pricing of its debt. CDS spreads, loan spreads and bond yield spreads all increase at the time of CEO turnover, when management risk is highest, and decline over the first three years of CEO tenure, regardless of the reason for the turnover. A similar pattern but of smaller magnitude occurs around CFO turnovers. The increase in the CDS spread at the time of the CEO departure announcement, the change in the spread when the incoming CEO takes office, as well as the sensitivity of the spread to the new CEO\u2019s tenure, all depend on the amount of prior uncertainty about the new management.\n\n",
