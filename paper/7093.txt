Does "Grease Money" Speed Up the Wheels of Commerce?
Daniel Kaufmann and Shang-Jin Wei
NBER Working Paper No. 7093
April 1999

JEL No. 012, P20, F30
ABSTRACT
In an environment in which bureaucratic burden and delay are exogenous, an individual firm

may find bribes helpful to reduce the effective red tape it faces. The "efficient grease" hypothesis
asserts therefore that corruption can improve economic efficiency and that fighting bribery would

be counter-productive. This need not be the case. In a general equilibrium in which regulatory
burden and delay can be endogenously chosen by rent-seeking bureaucrats, the effective (not just
nominal) red tape and bribery may be positively correlated across firms.
Using data from three worldwide firm-level surveys, we examine the relationship between

bribe payment, management time wasted with bureaucrats, and cost of capital. Contrary to the
"efficient grease" theory, we find that firms that pay more bribes are also likely to spend more, not
less, management time with bureaucrats negotiating regulations, and face higher, not lower, cost of

capital.

hypothesis.

If bribes "grease the wheels of commerce," then campaigns by governments or

international organizations to combat corruption in

international arena, such as the U.S. FCPA or the

OECD anti-bribery convention, would be counter-productive. We argue that this "efficient grease"
theory rests on a crucial assumption that should not be taken for granted. The assumption

is that the

red tape/regulatory burden (tax, licenses, delay, and so on) can be taken as exogenous, independent

of the incentive for officials to take bribes. Because of the assumption, the theory is partial
equilibrium in nature, and may not hold in a general equilibrium.
This point is not new. In sharp contrast to the views of Huntington, Leff and others at the time,

Myrdal in his epic Asian Drama (1968) suggested already a possible perverse relationship between
bureaucratic regulations and bribery. More recently Baneijee (1997) has formalized certain aspects
of that relationship, while Bardhan (1997) in his excellent survey paper on corruption (1997), states:

"In the second-best case made above, it is usually presumed that a given set of
distortions are mitigated or circumvented by the effects ofcorruption; but quite often these
distortions and corruption are caused or at least preserved or aggravated by the same factors.
The distortions are not exogenous to the system and are instead often part of the built-in corrupt

practices of a patron-client political system."
There is already a considerable literature on the consequences of corruption. On theoretical
ground, Susan Rose-Ackerman (1974 and 1978), Shleifer and Vishny (1993 and 1994), and Bliss and
Di TeIla (1997), among others, have modeled problems of corruption. In particular, Shleifer and
Vishny also make the point that a country's regulatory burden may be endogenously exploited by
corruption-prone officials for the purpose of extracting bribes. We extend their argument one step
further, arguing that even within a country, because the bureaucrats have discretionary power with

officials can often "customize" the nature and amount of
a given regulation, corruption-prone
harassment on firms to extract maximum bribes possible. In other words, they would charge
according to "ability to pay." In equilibrium, firms that pay more bribes could still face higher, not
lower, effective red tape.

On empirical ground, Mauro (1995), Hines (1995),

Kaufinann(1997a), Tanzi (1997) and Wei

3

(1997a) have shown the negative effects of corruption on

economic growth, business development,

on driving firms to the unofficial economy, on public expenditures, and on domestic

and foreign

investment.
There is also a substantial non-technical and illuminating work on the consequences of corruption,

such as in Klitgaard (1990). Also, Andvig (1991) and, more recently, Bardhan (1997), RoseAckerman (1997), Ades and Di Tella (1997) and Tanzi (1999) provide excellent surveys on analytical

and empirical issues related to the economics of corruption.

In this paper we first develop a simple model that builds on the insight that bureaucratic
harassment may be endogenous. In addition, the model also stresses the role of firms' different
commitment ability (not to tolerate certain levels of bribery request) as a function of their
characteristics. We then turn to some statistical evidence. The empirical literature has generally
employed selective country-level corruption perception index and investigated its consequence on
various measures of economic performances for the overall economies. This paper uses data from
three firm-level surveys, focusing on the interaction at the micro-level between the firms and the
public officials.

The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents amodel which challenges the
"efficient grease" theory. Section 3 describes the data set. Sections 4-6 discuss various empirical
results. Section 7 concludes the paper.

2. A Simple Model
rent-seeking government official and a
Our simple model is a Stackleberg game between a
representative firm k. The official moves first to choose harassment or bureaucratic delay in order to
maximize bribe intake, and the firms which is a price taker movesnext to choose the bribe payment

in order to maximize the after-bribe profit.
We solve for the equilibrium levels of bribe and red tape by backward induction. Consider first

the problem faced by the firm.

4

Firm
Suppose bk is the amount of bribery firm k has to pay to a corruption-prone government official,

and ltk is the profit the firm would have attained without any

harassment from government officials.

Let hk be the (nominal) harassment that the official imposes on the firm, which could be tax
license
asses sment, fire safety standard on the book, or the published number of days that a given
application can take. We make the nominal harassment firm-specific to emphasize that the

official has

discretion over the actual implementation of a given regulation. In other words, red tape can be
customized (to some extent).
We make a distinction between effective or "real" harassment -- the red tape that firm actually
faces after paying a bribe, and the nominal harassment -- the red tape announced by the bureaucrat
or "on the book" before the firm pays the bribe. Let rk be the "real" or effective harassment --

the red

tape the firm actually faces after making a bribe payment.

a narrow version of "efficient grease" hypothesis -- if nominal harassment is constant, then bribery

and effective harassment are negatively correlated -- holds by assumption.

To simplif,r the story, we assume that the pre-bribety profit, tk, is predetermined. The
representative firm's objective is to maximize its post-bribeand post-harassment profit, which is given

that relates the optimal amount of bribe firm

k would pay (if without any constraint on the maximum

bribe) and the nominal rate of harassment,

h:

This defines an optimal bribery schedule:
bk = B(hk)

Totally differentiating the first-order condition, we can see that the bribery schedule is upwardsloping,

firm finds optimal to give.
In other words, the higher is the nominal harassment, the morethebribe
The above bribery schedule assumes that the firm has to tolerate any level of harassment and give

bribes accordingly. We now consider the more relevant case that every firm has an exit option, and

therefore a maximum amount of harassment it is willing to tolerate. Suppose h k denote the
maximum harassment that firm k would tolerate (at which point it isindifferent between exiting or
not). That is, it can commit not to tolerate anything above h k because of the characteristics of the

firm, the industry it is in, or the source country it is from. With this commitment, the firm will no
longer solve the above unconstrained problem. Consequently, the actual bribe the firm will be willing
to pay is:

bk=min (B(hk*),B(hl) }
Bureaucrat:

For now, let us assume that the bureaucrat sets the harassment rate, h1, (e.g., tax, license,
regulation and delay) solely for the purpose of extracting bribe payment. Assuming that the
bureaucrat's utility is an increasing ftinction of briber intake, she would choose to impose just enough

harassment to induce the firm to pay the maximum amount of bribeit is willing to tolerate, namely,
bk*! B4(hk*). In equilibrium, the firm would pay exactly bk*. This implies that nominal harassment
and bribery are positively correlated across firms.

That is not the end of the story. We can examine the relationship between the effective rate of
harassment and the bribery in equilibrium,

Therefore, in this model, those firms that pay more bribes not only face higher
harassment in equilibrium, but also have to deal with higher effective rate of harassment. This is in
sharp contrast with the "efficient grease" hypothesis.

To sum up, if one allows regulation, tax, and bureaucratic red tape and their discretionary
enforcement to be endogenously chosen by rent-seeking officials, the officials may charge according
to the firms' "ability to pay" by raising the nominal harassment sufficiently. In terms of empirical
prediction, we may observe a positive, rather than a negative, correlation between the "effective" red

tape and bribe in equilibrium across firms.

3. Data
In the empirical part of the paper, we examine the relationship between bribe payment and some
measures of effective bureaucratic harassment. There are many types of harassment one can think of.

Our primary focus will be a proxy for the (actual) time senior managers of firms have to spend
negotiating with bureaucrats on regulations, but we will also look at proxies for effective regulatory
burden and extent of regulatory discretion, and the (reported effective) cost of capital as other
measures of effective harassment.

We will explore data from three different surveys: (1) Survey for the

1997 Global

Competitiveness Report (GCR97 for short), (2) that for the 1996 Global Competitiveness Report
(GCR96 for short), and (3) that for the 1997 World Development Report (WDR97 for short).
The two 6CR survey were conducted in late 1995 and 1996, respectively, under the auspices of

the Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Harvard Institute for International

7

which 2381 firms

respond both to the questions on corruption and on time spent by firm managers with bureaucrats.
The publicly released GCR report publishes the country average of the survey responses to all the

survey questions. For our study, we largely use the unpublished individual firm level responses.
Further, we also use the data from the GCR 1996, where 1537 firms (1503 non-missing observations

for the questions of our interest) were surveyed in 48 countries. Both survey instruments differ in
terms of some of the questions covered, and we find that for our purposes there are some relevant
questions in each survey.

The WDR97 survey was conducted by the World Bank in 3866 firms covering 73 countriesin
preparation of its Annual Report in 1997.
There are three main reasons for using these three surveys. First, these surveys have differences

in coverage in terms of countries surveyed and questions asked. For example, the GCR97 survey
covers ten more countries than GCR96, and contains 26 countries notin the WDR97 survey, whereas

the WDR97 survey contains 41 countries that are not covered by GCR97. For a completelist of
country coverages in the three surveys, please see Appendix 1. Second,because some of the key
variables such as corruption are perception-based subjective measures, we would like to see if our
basic findings can be corroborated across different, independently conducted surveys. Finally, the

characteristics of respondents are different between the GCR surveys and the WDR survey. The
(ICR surveys are distributed among member firms of the World Economic Forum which tend tobe
large, sometimes multinational, firms. The WDR survey, on the other hand, may have more medium
and even small sized firms in the sample.

We now turn to an explanation of the key variables we attempt to measure.
Corruption. The (ICR 1997 does not ask directly for the magnitudes of bribe paymentmade by
the respondents. All questions in that survey are on the variable ratings by the respondent in a scale

of 1 to 7. Specifically for corruption the survey asks the respondents, in question 8.02, to ratethe
level of corruption, on a one-to-seven scale, according to the extent of "irregular, additional payments

connected with imports and exports permits, business licenses, exchange controls, tax assessments,

8

policy protection or loan applications." To check the reliability

of this indicator, we correlated the

country means of that variable in the GCR survey with the corruption rankings in Business
International and Transparency International. The pairwise correlations are 0.77 and 0.83,
respectively, indicating a broad agreement on corruption ranking across countries among different
sources. This was similarly the case for the variable rating corruption in the GCR1996.
For the empirical work, we make the assumption that individual firm's rating is correlated with
their individual experience in bribery payment. Hence, firms that give a worse rating ontheir reported
perceived incidence of bribery in the survey do indeed find themselves in a position to have to pay
more bribes in their business operation. This assumption will be maintained for much of the statistical
work. We will discuss the implication of relaxing it later in the paper.
In the WDR97 Private Sector Survey of 3700 firms, Question 14 asks: "Is it common for firms
in my line of business to have to pay some irregular, "additional" payments to get things done?" The

respondent is asked to rate corruption on a 1-6 scalewith 1 meaning "always" and 6 "never."

Time spent by managers with bureaucrats. The GCR 1997 survey asks the respondents, in
Question 2.06, on a one-to-seven scale, whether the "senior management of your company" spends
more or less than "30% of its time dealing with government bureaucracy." An answer of "4" (in the
scale of 1 to 7) is calibrated to mean the management has spent roughly 30% of time. We use answer

to this question to measure the time the management of the firm has wasted in dealing with
regulation, negotiating tax relief; and so on. This question was not asked in GCR 1996.
In the WDR97 Private Sector survey, Question 21 asked, "what percentage of senior management
time is spent on negotiation with officials about changes and interpretations of laws and regulations?

(1) less than 5%, (2) 5-15%, (3) 15-25%, (4) 25-50%, (5) 50-75%, and (6) more than 75%." In our
regressions, we re-code the answer (1) to 2%. From (2) to (5), we use the midpoint. For (6), we use
80%.
Unpredictability Unpredictability index is based on the answers to three questions (15, 16 and 17)

in the WDR97 Private Sector Survey. Question 15 asked respondentshow much they agree to the
statement that, "firms in my line of business usually know in advanceabout how much this 'additional

9

"even if a firm
payment' is." Question 16 was on the extent of agreement with the statement that,
has to make an 'additional payment' it always has to fear that it will be asked for more, e.g., by other
officials." And Question 17 asked the extent of agreement to the statement that, "if a firm pays the
required 'additional payment' the service is usually also delivered as agreed." All three questions were

answered on a one to six scale.

Cost of capital. Only in GCR 1996 there was a question (4.09) which asked firms to rate in a
scale of 1 to 6 whether the cost of capital was too high/does not hinder competitive business
development. For purposes of comparability with the estimations of the regressions using the GCR

1997 data we re-scaled this variable to a scale ranging between 1 to 7.
Regulation. We extract two aspects of government regulations fromthe GCR97 survey. The first

• one, which we label as "regulatory burden," is derived from Question 2.02, which asks the
respondents to rate on a one-to-seven basis the degree towhich "government regulations impose a
heavy burden on business competitiveness."
The second one, which we label as "regulatory discretion," is derived from Question 2.08, which
asks the respondents to rate on a one-to-seven scale the degree to which the "government regulations

are vague and lax."

4. Evidence from the Firm Surveys for the Global Competitiveness Reports
Using the data from the two GCR surveys, we now examine the empiricalrelationship between
corruption payment and effective bureaucratic harassment. There are many types of bureaucratic

harassment we can imagine. Many are not in the surveys. We focus as our primary measure of
effective harassment the time cost that the firms' management has to incur with governmentofficial
negotiating interpretations of regulations. The "efficient grease" hypothesis would suggest a negative

correlation between bribes and the effective wasted time: firms that pay more bribes to buy savings
in terms of the time in getting the officials to certify compliance with the (nominal) regulations and/or

in securing licenses. That is why many of the "grease payments" are also called "speed money."

10

In addition, we will also look into regulatory burden and cost of capital as alternative measures
of the effective harassment.

Let us start with a cross-country comparison between average time wasted and average bribery
tendency, on the basis of the GCR 1997 data. If we regress the country-level measure of time wasted

by senior managers of firms with public officials on a constant and the country-level measureof
bribery2, we obtain a slope coefficient of 0.29 which is statistically significant at the five percent level

(not reported). Therefore, countries that allow corruption and bribery to flourish are, on average, also

those in which the firms in the country waste more, not less, time with government officials haggling

over regulations.
Of course, cross country regressions based on average indices can have serious drawbacks, both
masking the richness of individual observations and also potentially biasing the results. For instance,

there may be differences in country characteristics (e.g., the extent of regulation) that may be
correlated both with corruption and wasted time.

Thus, we turn next to examine if, within a country, there is any association at the firm level
between time-wasted and bribe burden (as measured by firm-specific bribery level). Table 1 reports
on a basic set of regressions of the determinants of time spent by the firm's management with public

officials. Column 1 reports the most basic regression without the country fixed effects, based on all

2761 firms in the (1CR 1997 survey. The coefficient (0.33) is positive and statistically significant.
Once we control for the country fixed effects (Column 2), the point coefficient declines to 0.27, but
remains to be positive and statistically significant. This is consistent with our model, but inconsistent

with the "efficient grease" hypothesis.

As a check of robustness, we also look at two alternative measures of effective red tape: the
degree of effective regulatory burden and regulatory discretion from the same survey. Here, we

regard the cross-firm differences in these measures as true differences in regulation that firms
experience. The possibility that the reported difference is just difference in firms' perception will be

examined in a later section.

2A country-level measure of time wasted for a particular country is the equally weighted average of all individual
responses for that countly on the relevant question. The countiy-level measure of bribery is constructed in the same way.
Appendix A reports the country-level measures of bribery from the three surveys.

II

Columns 3-6 in Table 1 report regressions with effective regulatory burden and effective
regulatory discretion as the dependent variables, respectively. We see again, there is a clear positive
relationship between bribery and effective red tape the firms face.

In Column 7, we go back to focusing on time wasted as the dependent variable. In addition to
country and sector fixed effects, we also control for the relationship between regulations and bribery,

and we also add two other firm characteristics (whether the firm is large, and whether it is a foreign

investor). There is some evidence that a large or foreign firm, on average, experiences less time

wasted with government officials. Most crucial to our discussion, we see that the coefficient on
bribery declines (relative to Column 2) to 0.17, but remains positive and statistically significant. In
Columns 8 and 9, we perform the regression on two subsamples of countries (those with high average

bribery, and those with high average effective regulatory burden). Again, we see that firms that pay

more bribes, in equilibrium, experience more, not less, time wasted with the officials on matters

related to regulations. Overall, there is no evidence that would support the "efficient grease"
hypothesis.

Asian Exceptionalism?

Some writers have long conjectured that --even if it is shown that overall bribery and corruption

is inimical to growth and business development-- the Asian experience suggest that there is
something special about that region, where in fact the "grease" argument may have had more
currency and validity. One often hears the view that corruption has been part of the Asian culture
for a long time and does not seem to hamper the business there.
We now undertake an explicit examination of the Asian exceptionalism hypothesis. Focusing on

the subsample of the Asian countries, we replicate the key regressions in Table 1 and report the
results in Table 2. We see that bribery is positively correlated with all three measures of effective red

tape. If anything, the slope coefficient tends to be bigger for the Asian subsample than for all
countries together. Thus, the evidence rejects overwhelmingly the Asian exceptionalism hypothesis.

Corruption and Cost-of-Capital

As another check on the relationship between bribery and effective red tape, we now look at a

12

measure of (firm-specific) cost of capital from the 1996 GCR survey3. Government officials may have

discretionary power over to which firm to allocate subsidized loans and at what terms. The "efficient

grease" hypothesis would suggest that those firms which pay more bribes should have better access
to cheaper credit and hence have a lower cost of capital. Table 3 presents the regressions of the cost

of capital on bribery. Column 1 presents a simple regression where corruption is the only regressor

(other than the intercept). The coefficient on bribery is positive and significant. In later columns

where different specifications and subsamples are experimented, we always obtain the same
qualitative result. Therefore, firms that have paid more bribes also have higher, not lower, cost of
capital. This is inconsistent with the "efficient grease" hypothesis.

5. Evidence from the Firm Survey for the 1997 World Development Report
The time wasted variable in the GCR97 survey is a qualitative measure. In comparison, the same

variable in the WDR97 survey asks for more precise, quantitative questions. The two surveys are also

different in terms of country coverage and methodology. So, in this section, we examine the link
between bribery and effective red tape based on the data from the WDR97 survey.
Table 4 re-examines the relationship between corruption frequencies and effective red tape. The

first two columns look at the extent of regulatory burden. As in the GCR survey, there is again a
positive correlation between bribery frequency and regulatory burden.
The remaining part of the table reports regressions with time spent with government officials as

the dependent variable. We see that the frequency of corruption and managers' time spent with
officials are positively correlated, just like in the GCR samples. That is, firms that report to have paid

more bribes also have more management time spent negotiating with the bureaucracies, which is

inconsistent with the beneficial grease hypothesis. This is true after we control the country fixed
effects regulatory burden, predictability of bribe transaction, and firm size. The same pattern holds
when we restrict our attention to the subsample of all foreign firms, or all domestic firms (Columns

6 and 7), and to the subsample of countries with relatively high predictability of corruption. Again

3The GCR96 survey did not ask the question on time spent with government officials, whereas the GCR97 survey
did not ask the question on the cost of capital.

13

the same pattern appears in the subsample of countries in which bribe payments are high, or in the
sample of Latin American and Caribbeans, and Asian countries (not reported).

6. Possible Perception Bias

A potential problem with the above regression analysis stems from possible survey respondent
perception bias that may be correlated across survey questions. Suppose that firms A and B have to

pay exactly the same amount of bribes, and that their managers have to spend the exactly the same
amount of time with government officials. If the manager in firm A who answers the survey questions

happen to have a bad feeling towards the government, he may give a worse ratings on both corruption

and management time questions. If this happens, we may mistakenly think that the answers from
these firms indicate a positive relationship between bribery and time the managers spend with officials

even though none exists by our initial assumption. Note such perception bias is a potential problem
for many research based on survey responese.

To address this concern, we construct a measure of perception bias at the level of individual
respondents, based on how the respondents rate the quality of arguebly identical public good. We
label our measure as "Kvetch4," after the Yiddish expression for habitual complainer.
Let us start with the GCR97 survey. In order to ensure robustness of our subsequent regression

results, we construct three Kvetch measures, using incrementally more questions from the survey.
"Kvetchl" is the deviation of individual respondent's answer to Question 4.01, "overall infrastructure

in your country" is "worse than in your major trading partners," from the average answer from all
respondents in that country. A high number implies a greater tendency to gripe.
"Kvetch2" is an equally-weighted average of the individual answer's deviations from the mean for

Question 4.01 (described above) and Question 4.12 ("government budget neglects infrastructure
investment").
"Kvetch3"is an equally-weighted average of the individual answers from the national mean for

four questions, 4.01 and 4.12 described above, plus 4.09 ("your country suffers from severe power

4According to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionaiy, Kvetch (a Yiddish word) as a noun means a habitual
complainer. It can also be used as a verb to mean "to complain habitually: GRIPE."

14

shortage") and 4.11 ("warehousing, storage facilities, and distribution networks are grossly
inadequate"). Again, a high number imply a greater tendency to gripe.
We include these measures, one by one, in our regressions in order to control for the possibilities

that some respondents are more likely than others to exaggerate how bad government officials are

on every question. The objective is to see if the positive association between the time managers
spend with government officials and perceived corruption level reported early would go away with

this control.
Note that quality of the public goods covered by the Kvetch measures, particularly "Kvetch3,"
may, to some degree, be "customized" for exactly the same reason as our theoretic story. Therefore,

these measures may over-correct the perception bias. In other words, there is a risk that the positive
association between the time managers spend and corruption disappears when the Kvetch measures
are added into the regressions even when the true relationship is positive.
Table 5 reports the regression results. All three kvetch measures have positive coefficients in all
regressions, and eight out of nine of them are statistically significant. Including the Kvetch measures
tend to reduce the point estimates on the bribery coefficient relative to the comparable specifications
without Kvetch (Table 1). This is consistent with the hypothesis that perception bias may be present.
However, even after controlling for the perception bias, the positive correlation between bribery and

effective red tape does not go away.

We implement a similar idea to the WDR samply. First, we also construct three measures of
perception bias which use increasingly more questions from the surveys. "Kvetchl" is an equally
weighted average of the respondent's ratings (on a 1-6 scale with 1 being the best and 6 the poorest)

of the following three public goods: the general condition of roads, the efficiency of mail delivery,
and the quality of public care provision5.

"Kvetch2" is an equally weighted average of the respondent's ratings (all on a 1-6 scale with 1
being the best) of the following four public goods: General rating of the efficiency of government in

delivering services right now (Question 25, Part 1, in the WDR survey), plus the three questions
covered in "Kvetch 1."

"Kvetch3" is equally weighted average of the ratings of six questions: in addition to the four
They are Question 22 b-d, respectively, in the WDR97 survey.

public goods covered in "Kvetch2," we add "frequency of power outages" and "time it takes to get

a public telephone line connected" (Questions 23 and 24, respectively, in the WDR survey).
Next, we repeat the key regressions in Table 4 with the three Kvetch measures added one by one.

The regression results are reported in Table 6. As we can see, the Kvetch variables are positively
correlated with the measures of red tape (regulatory burden and the time firm officers have to spend

with government officials), and their inclusion generally reduces the coefficient on the bribery
variable. This suggests that part of the correlation between reported effective red tape and reported
bribery frequency may indeed relate to the Kvetch effect. However, in all cases, the coefficients on
the bribery variable remain positive and statistically significant, suggesting the perception bias due to

differential grumpiness is not the driving reason for our earlier findings.

7. Conclusions and Implications
If bureaucratic burden and delay are exogenous, bribe payment may help firms to reduce the
effective burden and delay they face. In a more general equilibrium in which regulatory burden and
delay are endogenously chosen by the bureaucrats in order to extract rents, more bribe payment will

not be associated with less delay and lower burden. In a simple model, we show that the contrary
can be true: the bribes firms have to pay and the effective harassment they face in equilibrium can be

positively correlated.
In the second part of the paper, we examine some evidence from three large firm-level surveys,
focusing on the relationship between bribe payment and a variety of measures of offical harassment

(management time wasted with bureaucracy, regulatory burden, and cost of capital). The evidence
suggests that there is no support for the "efficient grease" hypothesis. In fact, a consistent pattern is
that bribery and measures of official harassment are positively correlated across firms.
While the surveys at hand have some clear advantages for our purposes, such as questions asking
thousands of firms throughout the world on the very variables we are honing in, its potential problems

ought to be explicitly taken into account as well. Chief among them is the possible perception bias,
given that the survey does not elicit hard numbers from the respondents but only ratings in an index.

We have proposed and implemented an approach to deal with perception bias and found that the

16

results are still robust. Future work with a more precise measure of bribery (and other variables)

could helps us obtain more accurate answer.

Just to clariij, this paper does not say that a bribe-paying firm in a corrupt environment is
individually irrational. Rather, it says that the business community as a whole can benefit from
international laws that strengthen their ability to credibly commit to no-bribery even if an individual
firm may find it otherwise optimal to bribe in a corrupt environment,. Such laws not only may reduce

bribe payment, it may actually reduce the harassment firms may face in equilibrium.

Notes:

(1) GCR96 and GCR97 — surveys conducted by the World Economic Forum and
Harvard Institute for International Development for the 1996 and 1997 Global
Competitiveness Reports, respectively. WDR — survey conducted by the World
Bank for its 1997 World Development Report.

(2) GCR and WDR surveys are on 1-7 and 1-6 scales, respectively. Corruption
rating for a country in this table is the average of all individual responses for that
country. In both original surveys, a low number means more corruption. To
minimize awkwardness in interpretation, we re-scale the ratings so that a high
number means more corruption. For example, GCR rating reported here = 8original GCR rating, WDR rating reported here = 7-original WDR rating.
