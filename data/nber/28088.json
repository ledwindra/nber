    "abstract": "\n\nWe study asset and debt characteristics of US bank holding companies. We show that financial institutions, especially large institutions, are not just about holding discrete assets. Services and going-concern values are important, and capital market debt against going-concern values accounts for 10% to 15% of total assets, comparable to the volume of capital market debt against discrete assets. We find that financial institutions\u2019 debt against going-concern values has weak monitoring, relative to similar debt among non-financial firms. We argue that weak monitoring prevails because creditors cannot easily punish or restructure these institutions should they violate covenants, which limits covenants\u2019 usefulness.\n\n",
