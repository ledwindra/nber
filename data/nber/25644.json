    "abstract": "\n\nWe derive a measure that captures the extent to which overlapping ownership structures shift managers\u2019 incentives to internalize externalities. A key feature of the measure is that it allows for the possibility that not all investors are attentive to whether a manager\u2019s actions benefit the investor\u2019s overall portfolio. Empirically, we show that potential drivers of ownership overlap, including mergers in the asset management industry and the growth of indexing, could in fact diminish managerial motives. Our findings illustrate the importance of accounting for investor inattention and cast doubt on the possibility that the growth of common ownership has had a significant impact on managerial incentives.\n\n",
