    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper investigates the drivers of support for market mechanisms (competition and optimizing behavior by agents). We elicit such attitudes using concrete and simplified situations where respondents face a tradeoff between an economically efficient situation and a pro-social objective. We find that support for deviation from efficient solutions achieved through market mechanism is strongly correlated with moral values as defined by Haidt (2013): care, fairness, loyalty and authority. While the traditional left-right divide spans some of this variation, an even bigger role is played by what we label \u201cindividualism\u201d, the average support for all 4 values, a moral stance orthogonal to the left-right divide. We ground this measure of individualism in the sociology of Emile Durkheim.\n\n",
