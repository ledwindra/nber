    "abstract": "\n\nThe role of data analysis in communication, persuasion, and decision-making is discussed. Some problems with current data-analysis practice are presented, including communication, complex models, large data bases, one-pass processing, rigid assumptions, resistance, validity, prior information, access to new methods, and the responsiveness of data analysis researchers to real world needs. Recent progress in these areas is then outlined, with emphasis on graphics, Bayesian regression, robust estimation, and jackknife, and interactive computing systems. Some remaining challenges for data analysts and others who are trying to integrate data into decision-making processes are discussed.\n\n",
