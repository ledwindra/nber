    "abstract": "\n\nWe recast the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model of income and wealth distribution in continuous time. This workhorse model \u2013 as well as heterogeneous agent models more generally \u2013 then boils down to a system of partial differential equations, a fact we take advantage of to make two types of contributions. First, a number of new theoretical results: (i) an analytic characterization of the consumption and saving behavior of the poor, particularly their marginal propensities to consume; (ii) a closed-form solution for the wealth distribution in a special case with two income types; (iii) a proof that there is a unique stationary equilibrium if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is weakly greater than one; (iv) characterization of \u201csoft\u201d borrowing constraints. Second, we develop a simple, efficient and portable algorithm for numerically solving for equilibria in a wide class of heterogeneous agent models, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model.\n\n",
