Quality-Consistent Estimates of International Returns to Skill

NBER Working Paper No. 12664
November 2006
JEL No. I2,J2
ABSTRACT
Returns to education are traditionally estimated in a Mincer wage equation from the variation in schooling
for a cross-section of individuals of different ages. Because individuals receive education at different
time periods, when the quality of their education may not be identical, this method leads to an overor under-estimation of the return to education of a given quality depending on how education quality
evolves over time. This quality issue interacts with ability bias from self-selection into schooling and
is particularly problematic when comparing returns across different countries. Using microdata from
the International Adult Literacy Survey, we construct quality adjusted measures of schooling attained
at different time periods and use these along with international literacy test information to estimate
returns to skills for 13 countries. Estimated returns to quality-adjusted education are considerably higher
than the traditional estimate for most countries, but these are offset to varying degrees by selection
biases on ability. The combined corrections alter significantly the pattern of returns to schooling and
skill seen from naïve Mincer wage equations.

Quality-Consistent Estimates of International Returns to Skill
By Eric A. Hanushek and Lei Zhang

1. Introduction
Much has been made of international differences in rates of return to schooling
(e.g., Psacharopoulos (1994), Harmon, Oosterbeek, and Walker (2003), Psacharopoulos
and Patrinos (2004)), but a parallel literature has highlighted potential problems with the
standard Mincerian estimation approach (e.g., Card (1999)). The most commonly
discussed problem is that higher ability individuals may systematically choose more
schooling, leading to an upward bias in the estimated return to schooling. Less
commonly, consideration is given to differences in student and school quality, which
would introduce systematic measurement error in schooling itself. Correcting for
measurement and selection issues is especially important for international comparisons of
returns to skills, but it also enters into the analyses of individual countries.
In the classical Mincer wage equation, the return to education is estimated making
use of the variation in years of schooling of a cross-section of individuals of varying ages.
The presumption is that, say, the cross-sectional earnings of a forty-five year old
secondary school graduate is a good indication of what a twenty-five year old graduate
can expect in 20 years. Prior attention has been given to the possibility that patterns of
technological change and productivity growth could systematically alter the future labor
market returns to schooling (Murphy and Welch (1992), Katz and Murphy (1992)). But,
limited attention has been given to the measurement of schooling itself. Two
circumstances have been considered: measurement error due to misreporting of school

attainment on surveys 2 and the possibility that a GED certificate is not the same as a
regular high school diploma. 3
Two other aspects of the measurement of schooling may, however, be more
important – particularly in an international context. First, if the quality of schooling
obtained differs across time, the estimated average return to schooling of different
qualities may over- or under-estimate the return to education for an individual depending
on how schooling quality has changed over time. Second, if the high school graduates of
different times were drawn from a different part of the ability distribution because of
changes in school enrollment and completion rates, the estimated return to graduates can
clearly be biased.
Accounting for secular changes in school quality has been difficult within most
available cross-sectional or panel data sets, because there are no data that track quality.
While some attempts rely on changes in measurable inputs – such as spending or pupilteacher ratios – the uncertain verification of these measures of quality has led to limited
acceptance. 4 Here we rely on external information about student cognitive skills for
individuals educated during different periods to provide information on changing school
quality.
The International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) not only provides test
information on skills for a broad age distribution but also includes data on labor market
outcomes in a number of different countries, thus permitting direct investigation both of
changes in school quality and of the returns to skill within different economies.
2

From their sample of twins, Ashenfelter and Krueger (1994) find that measurement error is more
important than selection problems in the estimation of the returns to schooling.

This debate can be traced through Card and Krueger (1992), Heckman, Layne-Farrar, and Todd (1996),
and Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996); see also Hanushek (2003).

We first construct a quality-adjusted years of schooling measure for individuals of
13 countries separately. This quality adjustment standardizes schooling obtained at
different points in time based on the relative contributions of schooling to cognitive
skills. For almost all countries in our sample, our analysis suggests that the contributions
of additional schooling to literacy skills are higher for more recent cohorts. This is
consistent with the average quality of schooling improving over time and in general
implies that the simple Mincer returns underestimate the value of an additional year of
schooling today. Compared to other countries, however, the adjustment of quality of
education in the US is less important, reflecting the general finding that school quality in
the US has been relatively stable for several decades. 5
While estimating the returns to cognitive skills in the U.S. has been previously
possible, largely because of panel data sets with labor market experiences, comparable
international estimates have been lacking. 6 This paper exploits the IALS data with its
information about a broad set of workers to expand significantly the international data
base on returns to skills and how these returns may be affected by the different aspects of
the underlying economies.
We also investigate the potential impact of statistical discrimination. If employers
differentiate among young workers largely on the basis of easily observable
characteristics such as schooling, the return to the easily observed variables should fall,
ceteris paribus, as employers learn more precisely about productivity. Using NLSY79
data, Altonji and Pierret (2001) find support of this proposition from US individuals

5

See Hanushek (2003); National Center for Education Statistics (2005).
Three recent U.S. studies provide direct (and quite consistent) estimates of the impact of test performance
on earnings using different panel data sets (Mulligan (1999); Murnane, Willett, Duhaldeborde, and Tyler
(2000); Lazear (2003)).

between 14 and 35 years of age. We test this hypothesis across countries and for a wider
range of age groups. We find little support for such labor market outcomes in most of our
sampled countries.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the underlying
international data. Section 3 sets up and estimates the empirical model of the quality of
schooling at different time periods and obtains a quality-adjusted years of schooling
measure. Section 4 presents the estimation of returns to quality-adjusted years of
schooling and to cognitive skills. In both sections, we discuss the similarities and
differences across countries.

2. The IALS Data
The primary data source is the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS),
conducted by the OECD. Twenty-three countries and regions participated in one of three
different waves of surveys conducted in 1994, 1996 and 1998. 7 IALS is designed to
compare individual literacy skills within and across countries. Representative samples of
adults between 16 and 65 years of age were given a series of literacy tests in the language
of their country of residence. The literacy skill measures were supplemented by variables
measuring other individual characteristics, such as age, education, employment, and
earnings.
Note that the oldest sampled individuals were born around 1930, while the
youngest in the sample (16-year-olds) were born around 1980. 8 The sample, heavily
weighted toward European countries, thus has significant numbers attending school
7

A technical description of the survey and data can be found in Murray, Kirsch, and Jenkins (1997). The
data are available from Statistics Canada: http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/89-588-XIE/about.htm

For reasons described below, much of our analysis is confined to the 25-65 age group.

around World War II and during postwar reconstruction – suggesting that school quality
may differ significantly for individuals with the same attainment but educated at different
times within each country.
IALS provides measurement of cognitive skills in three different areas. Prose
literacy measures the knowledge and skills needed to understand and use information
from texts including editorials, news stories, poems, and fiction. Document literacy
measures the knowledge and skills required to locate and use information contained in
various formats, including job applications, payroll forms, transportation schedules,
maps, tables, and graphics. Quantitative literacy measures the knowledge and skills
required to apply arithmetic operations, either alone or sequentially, to numbers
embedded in printed materials, such as balancing a checkbook, calculating a tip,
completing an order form, or determining the amount of interest on a loan from an
advertisement. The literacy scores range on a scale from 0 to 500 points for each area.
Since the literacy scores are highly correlated with each other, we use the average of the
scores in the analysis.
Table 1 provides summary statistics for the participating countries; the 13
countries in bold included continuous earnings measures and are included in the
subsequent labor market analysis. 9 Sample sizes range from 2,062 in Germany to 5,660
in Canada. On the literacy tests, individuals score an average of 267 points with a
standard deviation of 60 points. Sweden and Norway have the highest average, while
Chile is at the bottom. The final three columns show the considerable variation not only
in average school attainment but also the distribution. For example, Chile and the Czech

9

As discussed below, Canada, Slovenia, and the Italian region of Switzerland have continuous wage
measures but are missing other crucial data needed for the full estimation.

Republic have almost identical completion of tertiary schooling (around 16 percent) but
their average attainment differs by almost four years.
The literacy tests are designed to measure basic skills needed to participate fully
in modern society, and it is useful to put these literacy test scores into the perspective of
cognitive tests requiring deeper content knowledge and analytical skills. We compare the
quantitative IALS score of individuals between 16 and 25 years of age to the 1995
TIMSS math score of students at the final year of upper secondary education, who are
between 17 and 20 years of age. 10 Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between TIMSS
math score and young adults’ quantitative literacy score. Thirteen countries are included
in both IALS and TIMSS. The correlation between the average country scores is 0.77 and
is significantly different from zero. 11 Thus, the literacy scores appear to be a reasonable
index of general levels of skills.

3. School Quality
The goal of the empirical analysis is to provide estimates of the returns to
schooling of a given quality and to cognitive skills. Conceptually, one would follow
groups of individuals with differing investments in human capital over their entire careers
and observe how earnings evolve and differ. This conceptual best may not, however, be
ideal, because one would not like to be restricted just to evaluating human capital
investments made multiple decades earlier. An appealing analytical solution, laid out
10

The Third International Mathematics and Science Study, or TIMSS, conducted in 1995 involved
participation of 40 countries and followed two prior test development cycles for math and for science. It is
commonly accepted as a valid test for differences in math skills and includes a variety of high level items
covering calculus, probability and statistics, and geometry. See http://timss.bc.edu/timss1995.html . With
testing in 1999 and after, TIMSS was renamed the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study.
11
The correlation is calculated for 12 countries: Czech Republic appears to be an outlier in the scatter plot.
The same relationship holds when we restrict the IALS sample to the same age group as the TIMSS, but we
lose Canada because it does not have an age measure. The same relationship holds for male and female
separately.

clearly in Mincer (1970, 1974), is to use data about otherwise similar individuals who
provide investment-earnings observations at different points in the life-cycle. The key
question, one that has driven much of the subsequent research, is when individuals are
“otherwise similar.”
Our focus is ensuring that individuals are comparable in terms both of school
quality and of cognitive skills. In this section, we estimate quality indices for schooling
received at different time periods and adjust years of schooling with these quality indices
relative to a base cohort. In the following section, we use the quality-adjusted years of
schooling in a Mincer wage regression designed to estimate the return to schooling and
the return to cognitive skills for this base cohort.
3.1 Identifying Changes in School Quality
To estimate school quality, we assume that, other things equal, an additional year
of quality-equivalent schooling produces the same increment in average literacy scores.
Quality of education received in different time periods for each country is derived from
coefficient estimates on cohort-specific and country-specific years of schooling variable
in a regression for the literacy score. Each cohort is a 10-year age group. We focus on
four cohorts aged 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, and 56-65 and take the cohort aged 26-35 as the
base cohort. 12

(1)

Likc = β kc ⋅ Sikc + X ik ⋅ γ k + ε ikc

12

This limitation of sample to individuals over 25 is due to two factors. First, many of the 16-25 age group
will still be in school, introducing sample selection biases in both the school quality analysis and the
earnings analysis. Second, we lack a critical variable, the selectivity of schooling, for this youngest cohort.

8

where Likc is the literacy score of individual i of country k and cohort c , Sikc is the
years of schooling of individual i of country k and cohort c , and X ik is a vector of
country-specific control variables; ε ikc is a stochastic error term. β kc measures the
marginal contribution to the literacy score of the schooling of cohort c in country k .
The estimation and interpretation of β kc are complicated by the fact that the
cohort-specific years-of-schooling measure reflects not only the education attainment of
an individual, but also other factors that vary with time. First, average years of schooling
have been continuously increasing for virtually every country over the past several
decades. 13 Associated with this improvement is the concern that the school and college
selectivity has gone down over time. In other words, if school continuation is related to
ability, people with lower innate ability have been promoted to higher schooling levels
over time. Our time-specific measure of school attainment may capture not only the
effects of schooling itself but also the decrease in school selectivity over time. If so, the
contributions of more recent cohorts’ schooling will be underestimated. We deal with
this problem by including a measure for school selectivity in X .
Second, individuals may gain or lose skills as a result of the aging process itself.
If individuals tend to lose skills because of aging, then the contributions of earlier
cohorts' schooling will be underestimated, and vice versa. We include in X a polynomial
of age, which is not country specific, to control for this problem. This specification

13

As we discuss below, these trends have been much stronger for other countries compared to the U.S.
This fact shows up in the regression estimates.

9

captures the idea that losing or gaining literacy skills due to physical and mental
depreciation is a universal process. 14
Third, differential learning-by-doing at the workplace across countries could
enter. The questions in the literacy tests of the survey, however, concern tasks of day-today life and are not job specific. Therefore, we assume that work experience has a limited
role in affecting the performance in the tests and that omitting work place learning does
not bias the estimates of the contributions of schooling to the literacy skill.
Because primary-secondary schooling quality and college quality may vary over
time in different manners, we also estimate Equation (1) splitting the schooling variable
into two parts: years of schooling before completing high school ( ≤ 12 years) and years
of schooling after completing high school. These two variables are again country-specific
and cohort-specific.
Using the youngest cohort as the base group (c=1), the quality-adjusted schooling
for somebody in country k and cohort c with schooling Sikc is found in Equation (2):
(2)

β
Si ikc = Sikc ⋅ kc ,
β k1

where the ratio β kc β k 1 reflects the estimated quality parameters. An index greater than 1
would indicate that cohort c 's schooling is of higher quality than that of the youngest
cohort; therefore, each year of schooling of cohort c 's would be equivalent to more than
one year of the youngest cohort's schooling.
3.2 International Patterns of School Quality Changes
14

See Smith and Marsiske (1997). The skill depreciation with the aging process could, of course, be
distorted by different time patterns of nutrition and health care across countries, but we have no way to deal
with this possibility.

10

Quality indices of schooling at different time periods are derived from the
estimated contributions of schooling at different time periods to the literacy skills.
Understanding the pattern of school selectivity across countries, because it indicates
varying ability of people with similar schooling at different times, is a first step.
We assume that in any given country, an individual of cohort c who completes
school level s has higher ability than any individual of the same cohort who completes a
school level less than s . If share ω of population of cohort c completes at least school
level s , then an individual of cohort c that completes school level s will have higher
ability than share 1 − ω of population of the same cohort. We therefore assign 1 − ω as
the selectivity measure for an individual i of cohort c who completes school level s .
This measure is simply the lower-bound ability measure for individual i .
Take the United States as an example. In 1994, 86% of individuals between ages
25 and 34 completed at least high school education, and 14% did not finish high school.
Therefore, an individual of this cohort that completed exactly high school has on average
higher ability than 14% of the cohort and is assigned a selectivity index of 0.14.
Similarly, the selectivity index of an average American in this cohort that completed at
least college education is 0.68.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2005) provides
historical information about completion of upper secondary and tertiary schooling by
different age groups across countries. 15 These data permit us to calculate selectivity

15

Historical data come from a variety of OECD publications including various years of Education at a
Glance (e.g., Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2005)) and Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (1995). Because we use the population survey information in
one year to characterize populations going to school at different time periods, we need to assume that the
underlying distribution for each cohort is stable over time. This assumption may not hold if, for example,
the proportion of immigrants in a cohort has changed considerably over time

11

indices across countries for individuals of different ages. The data on completing tertiary
education for some countries and some cohorts are also divided between academic and
vocational-technical. 16 The selectivity measures can range between 0 and 1, with
individuals completing less than upper secondary education receiving a selectivity
measure of zero.
Across sampled countries and over time, the selectivity of schooling shows wide
variation. Table 2 provides the selectivity measures ( 1 − ω ) for four cohorts of
individuals completing upper secondary education and completing tertiary education for
each country. (The top panel aggregates all tertiary schooling, while the bottom panel
separates vocational-technical from academic where available). While the U.S. has seen
little change in the selectivity of schooling over the four decades represented in Table 2,
other countries, such as Poland and Sweden, have had dramatic changes. The strong
trends toward more schooling imply that individuals from earlier cohorts have higher
selectivity measures than those from younger cohorts. This changing selectivity is also
more pronounced for individuals completing upper secondary education, as countries
have expanded secondary education at a much faster pace than tertiary education.
The school quality regression is based on individual observations for the average
literacy scores in prose, documentary, and quantitative skills (normalized to mean zero
and standard deviation of one within each country). The explanatory variables of primary
interest are the country- and cohort-specific years of schooling for four 10-year age

16

See Annex 3 of OECD Education at a Glance for a description of the International Standard
Classification of Education (ISCED). In short, type B tertiary education is generally practical-technicaloccupational oriented with a minimum duration of two years and does not prepare students for more
advanced study (vocational-technical). Type A tertiary education is more theoretically oriented with a
minimum duration of three years and is intended to provide sufficient qualifications for gaining entry into
advanced research programs and professions with high skills requirements (adademic).

cohorts: 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, and 56-65. We control for gender, selectivity of schooling,
age, and age squared. Since we control for selectivity (i.e., aggregate ability differences)
and the aging process, the coefficient estimate on a cohort specific schooling measure is
interpreted as the contribution to cognitive skills of an extra year of education of the
cohort. It reflects the quality of the education received by the cohort.
Coefficient estimates on cohort specific years of schooling and selectivity for
each country are reported in Table 3. For example, for the cohort aged 26-35 in the US,
one more year of schooling increases one's cognitive skill by 0.16 standard deviations.
Also reported is the p-value for the F-test that one more year of schooling of each cohort
has the same contribution to the cognitive skill. For most countries, schooling's
contribution to cognitive skills has increased gradually over time; the increase from the
cohort aged 56-65 to the cohort aged 26-35 ranges from 13% in Poland to 100% in
Germany, and the trend is statistically significant. For Switzerland, United States and
Italy, there is barely any change in the point estimates for schooling's contribution over
time, and the differences across cohorts are not statistically significant at the 5 percent
level. The coefficient estimates for Chile decrease over time, but it is not statistically
significant at conventional levels.
Selectivity is also important in tracking cognitive skills across cohorts. Our
measure of selectivity of different school attainment has a positive effect on cognitive
skills for all countries but Italy and is statistically significant at the 5 percent level for all
but Chile and the Czech Republic. The coefficient estimates on cohort specific years of
schooling suggest that education quality has increased steadily over time for most of the
European countries. A plausible, albeit speculative, explanation for this pattern of change

Notes: Sample includes all individuals between 26 and 65 years of age. Dependent variable is the normalized average literacy skill test score. Control variables
are age, age squared, country-specific school selectivity, and a country-specific indicator for female. Education’s contributions to literacy skills for different
cohorts are the coefficient estimates on the interactive terms between education (measure by total years of schooling) and indicators for the respective age
cohorts. P-value is for the F-test that education’s contributions to literacy skill are the same over the four cohorts.

in school quality relates to World War II and its aftermath. Countries experiencing
significant quality improvement tend to be those deeply involved in World War II; their
education system experienced severe damage and disruption during the war and had to be
reconstructed in the post-war period. The oldest cohort, who received their education
during or immediately after the war, would have suffered the most. With the national
education system gradually back to normal, the quality of education increased for the
following cohorts. The education systems in the U.S,, Chile, Switzerland, and Italy were
relatively undisrupted during the war, perhaps supporting the stable quality of schooling
over this period. 17
The coefficients on age and age squared (common to all countries) are 0.019 and
-0.00028 respectively; they are jointly significantly different from zero. By these
estimates, cognitive skills increase slightly with age for individuals between 26 and 34
years of age and then start to decay with rapid drop off after 55 years of age. This pattern
is consistent with findings in the literature on psychology of adult learning (see Smith and
Marsiske (1997) and references therein).
One concern is that the quality of primary-secondary schooling and the quality of
college education evolve differently. We address this concern by splitting years of
schooling into two parts: years of primary-secondary schooling (S ≤ 12 years) and years
of tertiary education (S > 12 years). Appendix Table A1 reports the coefficient estimates
on cohort specific primary-secondary schooling and tertiary schooling for each country,
again providing estimates of the contribution of one extra year of primary-secondary
schooling or college education to the cognitive skills for different cohorts. For every
17

See Lowe (1992) and U.S. Office of Education (1945). While Italy was clearly a combatant, Italy’s
wartime experience apparently had minimal effect on the schools, and the postwar reconstruction
proceeded rapidly; see Wolff (1992).

14

cohort in every country, primary-secondary schooling has a much bigger contribution to
cognitive skills than college education. This is expected given that the skills tested by
IALS are day-to-day tasks and are more directly affected by basic education. For the
same reason, the trends observed in Table 3 reflect to a large extent the evolution of the
primary-secondary schooling quality, as displayed in Appendix Table A1. The estimated
changes in quality of tertiary schooling are generally insignificant, although this could
simply reflect the much smaller samples of tertiary graduates than of primary and
secondary schooling.
Taking the cohort aged 26-35 as the base cohort, we construct a quality-adjusted
measure of years of schooling as defined in Equation (2), using the cohort-specific
estimate of education’s contribution to literacy skills reported in Table 3. Our qualityadjusted schooling measure is used to determine the lifetime return to different levels of
schooling for the base cohort. 18

4. Returns to Skills in the Labor Market
We now turn to the estimation of quality-consistent returns to schooling and
returns to literacy skills in the labor market. We apply a standard Mincer framework
using the quality-adjusted years of schooling measure as in Equation (3):

(3)

ln( yikc ) = δ1k ⋅ Si ikc + δ 2 k ⋅ Lik + Zik ⋅θ k + υikc

18

A quality-adjusted schooling measure constructed from Appendix Table A1 is very similar given the
closeness of estimates between Tables 3 and A1.

15

The dependent variable, ln( yikc ), is the logarithm of annual earnings from employment in
the survey year of individual i . Sj
ikc is individual i 's quality-adjusted years of schooling.
Likc is individual i 's normalized literacy skills test score. The literacy skill measure is
intended to proxy for individual productivity in the work place that is not captured by
adjusted schooling. Z ik is a vector of control variable, including an indicator for female,
potential experience, and an indicator for living in the rural area, and θ k is the vector of
relevant parameters. Because schooling is normalized relative to the quality of the
youngest cohort's schooling, the coefficient estimate of δ1k measures the lifetime return
to schooling for the youngest cohort in country k. The return to measured cognitive skills
is δ 2k .
While Equation (3) is our preferred earnings model, we provide separate estimates
of models with and without quality adjustments to schooling and with and without
inclusion of cognitive skills. In this way, we can relate our estimates to the common
alternatives in the literature.
In the earnings analysis, we focus on the 13 countries with continuous wage
measures in IALS. 19 We estimate the returns to education and to literacy skills using the
sample of individuals working fulltime during the 12 months prior to the survey. Fulltime
workers are defined as those working at least 40 weeks and at least 30 hours per week

19

Three countries (regions) with continuous wage measures are not included in the wage analysis for
different reasons. Canada does not have an age measure; Slovenia does not have historical information on
schooling patterns for estimation of the selectivity measure; and Italian speaking Switzerland has too few
observations.

16

during the previous 12 months. 20 Whenever we include quality-adjusted schooling, we
rely upon the estimates from the full IALS sample that were reported in Table 3.
4.1 Adjustment for School Quality
As a benchmark, we first estimate a classical Mincer wage equation using actual
years of schooling as the measure of the quantity of human capital, controlling for
gender, potential experience and its square, and an indicator for living in a rural area. The
return to schooling for each country is reported under Model 1 in Table 4. One extra year
of education increases annual earning by from 3.3% in Sweden to 10.5% in the United
States with an unweighted average across all countries of 6.0 percent. Educational
attainment is considerably more highly rewarded in the US than in other developed
countries, consistent with findings in the literature. Also noticeable is that the return to
education in the four less developed countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and
Chile) is much higher than that in other more developed European countries.
The classical Mincer framework makes use of variation in years of schooling
received at different time periods, and, as demonstrated, the quality of the schooling is
not comparable over time, making the Mincer estimates an average of the returns to
education of different qualities. The second panel of Table 4 reports the estimated return
to quality-adjusted schooling for the base cohort, the cohort aged 26-35 in the survey year
for each country.
While adjusting for secular changes in school quality makes little to no difference
in Chile, Italy, and the U.S., it substantially alters the estimated returns to schooling in the
remaining countries. The most salient difference between Model 1 and Model 2 in Table

20

For Sweden, the fulltime working status is based on answers to questions of whether a respondent works
and whether he works fulltime.

Sample includes full-time workers between 26 and 65 years of age. In all the models, the dependent variable is the logarithm of annual earnings from
employment; control variables are gender, potential experience and its square, and an indicator for living in rural area. In Model 1 education is measured by
actual years of schooling. In Model 2, education is measured by quality-adjusted years of schooling, where the quality index of schooling is derived from
education’s contribution literacy skills. Model 3 is Model 2 controlling for individual literacy skill. Model 4 is Model 1 controlling for individual literacy skill.

4 is that there is a significant increase in the return to education for most countries. The
increase in returns is over 30 percent in the Netherlands, and five of the 13 countries
show an increase in excess of 20 percent of the standard Mincer estimates. Table 6
displays the change in the rates of return estimates that comes from accounting for quality
movements, with an average of 15 percent increase from the basic Mincer return.
Estimates of Model 2 have smaller variation than those of Model 1. In particular,
the gap in the return to education between the United States and other countries becomes
smaller once the change in education quality is taken into account. This is readily seen in
Figure 2 that plots the unadjusted and adjusted Mincer returns across the 13 countries.
This convergence of estimates suggests that the much higher reward to education in the
US relative to other countries is in part an artifact of the stable quality of its education
system. With large improvement in the education system of other countries, the gap in the
return to education is noticeably smaller for today’s graduates.
4.2 Adjustment for Cognitive Skills
Measures of cognitive skills in Mincer earnings functions serve two purposes.
First, when the focus is school attainment, introduction of cognitive skills is viewed as a
direct way to correct for ability bias in estimating rates of return (see Card (1999)).
Second, cognitive skills permit investigation of how the labor market values different
skills, including those that might be related to schools and other policy levers. To
investigate how literacy skills are rewarded in the labor market of each country, we add
the normalized literacy score to the wage equation in Model 2. As shown in the third
panel with Model 3, literacy skills have a positive and statistically significant effect on
earnings in all countries except Poland.

After controlling for cognitive skills, the estimated return to education drops in all
countries. Thus, a considerable part of the estimated return to education in the classical
Mincer framework appears due to classical ability bias from the more able also getting
more schooling. The return to school attainment, however, is still positive and significant,
suggesting that schooling itself captures different individual characteristics than literacy
skills.
The pattern of returns along with the impact of ability bias on the estimates is
illustrated in Figure 3. Our preferred estimates that adjust both for school quality and for
individual cognitive skills are shown as the solid line. The bars represent the qualityadjusted returns to schooling without consideration of individual literacy scores.
Compared with Figure 2, it is clear that the two biases from standard estimation that
ignores both school quality and individual cognitive skills tend to offset within these
data: The larger returns from quality adjustment are reduced by considering ability bias.
Moreover, adjusting for individual ability lowers the U.S. return to quality adjusted
school attainment so that it is no longer the highest of our sampled countries.
With the exception of the United States, the high returns to schooling are
systematically found in the less developed countries in our sample. The countries with
more developed welfare states fall in the lower range of returns, but this is not just
because of higher taxes because these results are all pretax earnings.
The impact of cognitive skills is itself important. One standard deviation increase
in the literacy score increases annual earnings by from 5 percent in Italy to 24 percent in
the United States. The reward to cognitive skills falls between 5 percent and 15 percent
for all countries other than the U.S. Figure 4 shows the returns to literacy scores across

countries. Contrary to the pattern of returns to school attainment in Figure 3, there is no
obvious pattern as to where the returns to cognitive skills are high or low.
The estimates of the returns to skill in the IALS data for the United States are
significantly above those in recent studies. Using separate panel data on returns to
cognitive skills early in a career, three different estimates point very consistently to a
return of about 12 percent per standard deviation (see Mulligan (1999); Murnane, Willett,
Duhaldeborde, and Tyler (2000); Lazear (2003)). 21 Our larger estimates may reflect the
returns that accrue later in the working life and that are not observed in these panel data
estimates.
For a final comparison, we estimate the wage equation using actual years-ofschooling measure along with literacy skills. The results – similar to a number of similar
U.S. studies – are reported in the bottom panel of Table 4 as Model 4. Compared to
Model 1, the estimated return to education drops significantly; compared to Model 3, the
return to education is underestimated in most countries except the US, Switzerland, Italy,
and Chile. The return to literacy skills, however, is almost identical to that in Row 3.
Thus, using the quality-adjusted schooling measure produces similar return to literacy
skills and similar changes in the return to education compared to observed schooling
measure.
Table 5 summarizes the impact of the adjustment for school quality in models that
do and do not control for literacy scores of the individuals. Comparing the columns of

21

Murnane, Willett, Duhaldeborde, and Tyler (2000) provide evidence from the High School and Beyond
and the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972. Their estimates suggest some
variation with males obtaining a 15 percent increase and females a 10 percent increase per standard
deviation of test performance. Lazear (2003), relying on a somewhat younger sample from NELS88,
provides a single estimate of 12 percent. These estimates are also very close to those in Mulligan (1999),
who finds 11 percent for the normalized AFQT score in the NLSY data.

Table 5 shows that the changes from introducing quality adjustments to schooling are
almost identical whether or not literacy scores are independently added (with a
correlation of 0.98 for the 13 countries). Again, while the adjustments are not very
important for the U.S., where a majority of the existing earnings analyses have been
conducted, the same is not true for other countries in the sample.
It is interesting to compare the returns to schooling and the returns to cognitive
skills to the levels of schooling in the different countries. The top panel of Figure 5
shows that the returns to added schooling clearly drop with higher levels of schooling.
This pattern follows the frequently hypothesized diminishing returns to schooling. On
the other hand, the returns to cognitive skills tend to rise with schooling levels.
4.3 Test of Statistical Discrimination Hypothesis
In an intriguing paper, Altonji and Pierret (2001) suggest that the role of cognitive
skills – which are difficult for an employer to observe – may grow with the worker’s
experience in the labor market. At initial hiring, the employer relies more on the
observable measures of school attainment, but as time goes on the employer can
substitute direct observations of worker skills (measured here by literacy scores) for the
cruder proxy of years of schooling. This model is essentially one of statistical
discrimination with subsequent learning. We test this statistical discrimination
hypothesis across the broader range of countries than Altonji and Pierret had available.
We consider a simple formulation of this model that allows the return to (quality
adjusted) schooling and to literacy score to vary between early and late career such as:

ln( yikc ) = δ1k ⋅ Si ikc + δ 2 k ⋅ Likc + Z ikc ⋅ θ k + α i + δ1*k α i ⋅ Si ikc + δ 2*k (α i ⋅ Likc ) + υikc

where α i is an indicator for being in the early career stage defined in terms of potential
experience. By the statistical discrimination model, δ1* should be positive (i.e., early
returns to schooling exceed later returns) and δ 2* should be negative (i.e., early returns to
the difficult to observe cognitive skills are below later returns).
Table 6 provides evidence on this model for the 13 countries with IALS data. The
sample includes full-time workers between 16 and 65 years of age. To derive a qualityadjusted years of schooling measure for the cohort between ages 16 and 25, we create a
selectivity measure for this cohort from a linear extrapolation of the selectivity measures
of cohorts between ages 26 and 36 and between ages 36 and 45. For these estimates, we
define early career as potential experience less than or equal to five years. If we look first
at the United States, we see confirmation of the Altonji- Pierret model as changes in
compensation from early to later career match the statistical discrimination model. There
is, however, little support for this model in other countries. Only Chile produces
statistically significant estimates that match the hypothesis. While 10 of the 13 countries
have the returns to schooling higher in early career, the estimates are statistically
significant in just five (and even significant with the wrong sign in the case of Hungary).
Moreover, just half of the countries have even the expected sign on early career returns to
literary scores, and only four are statistically significant at the 10 percent level.
We also experimented with different forms of the estimation. Defining the early
career cutoff ( α i ) at 10 or 15 years yielded no qualitative change. We also applied
various interactions between potential experience and both school and literacy scores.
These were quite unstable, perhaps reflecting the small samples, but the interactions with

Sample includes full-time workers between 16 and 65 years of age. The dependent variable is the logarithm of annual earnings from employment; control
variables are gender, potential experience and its square, an indicator for living in rural area, education (measured by quality-adjusted years of schooling),
literacy skills, a dummy variable equal to 1 for individuals with potential experience no more than 5 years, and its interaction with education and literacy skills.

the literacy scores were never statistically significant while the interactions with
schooling provided mixed results.
It is plausible that the generally flexible labor markets in the United States use this
early career information more efficiently than the less flexible European markets. But,
for whatever reason, there is little indication that the general market adjustments of the
Altonji-Pierret model are found very broadly outside of the U.S.

5. Conclusion
The widespread use of the Mincer earnings model to assess the returns to
schooling around the world is testimony to its power to summarize important aspects of
human capital investment. It has been broadly used to analyze earnings and income
distribution questions both within and across countries. Their interpretation,
nevertheless, depends upon the deceptively simple empirical assumption that individuals
used in comparisons of schooling and earnings are otherwise similar. This paper not only
considers a series of key issues about the “otherwise similar” assumption but also extends
the analysis to a larger international context.
Microdata from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) provide a unique
opportunity to investigate international differences in the labor market returns to skill.
The consistent measures of cognitive skills for workers of different ages within 13
countries permit direct analysis of how selection into schooling at different points in time
affects common approaches used in estimating rates of return to schooling.
The concern receiving the most previous attention is that those with more
schooling might also be more able, thus leading to an upward bias in the estimated

23

returns to schooling. Past work on this, largely based upon U.S. labor markets, has
yielded inconsistent evidence about the impact and severity of this potential problem.
Our analysis indicates that this selection bias is very important, leading on average across
countries to a 25 percent overestimate of the rate of return to schooling. 22 The largest
upward bias across the sampled countries occurs in the United States, where the
unadjusted return exceeds the adjusted return by 60 percent.
A second concern, one that is particularly important in an international context, is
that the quality of schooling may have changed over time within a country. If so, treating
people with a given level of schooling obtained in different points in time can lead to bias
in the estimated returns with the direction depending on the pattern of school quality
change.
We construct an education quality index from the contribution of schooling
during different periods to cognitive skills (after also correcting for the selectivity of
schooling across time for each country). When we estimate wage equations using the
quality adjusted schooling measure, we find that the returns to schooling for current
cohorts are noticeably higher than the return to the unadjusted education in most
countries, with the rate of return underestimated by as much as 30 percent in some
countries. But quality adjustments do not affect the United States, and once the quality
trends are taken into account, the returns to schooling in other countries appear closer to
those in the US.
After applying both corrections to the estimated returns, the naïve Mincer
estimates are above the quality-consistent estimates in 8 of our 13 sampled countries.
22

The comparison of impacts of selectivity is unaffected by whether nominal years of schooling or qualityadjusted years of schooling are compared. The impact on estimated returns exceeds 10 percent for all
countries except Poland.

24

The varied results of biases suggest considerable caution in making international
comparisons of simple earnings differentials by schooling levels.
Cognitive skills play an important direct role in determining an individual's
earnings. Returns to cognitive skills are positive and significant in all but one country.
Cognitive skills receive the highest return in the US, and the return to cognitive skills is
positively correlated with the level of education attainment across nations.
We also extend the test of statistical discrimination hypothesis (Altonji and Pierret
(2001)) to full-time workers between 16 and 65 years of age in the thirteen countries.
Under this hypothesis, the returns to easily observable characteristics (such as schooling)
fall when employers can more directly view performance, and correspondingly the
returns to less easily observed measures (such as cognitive skills) rise. While the
estimation confirms these predictions in the United States, there is little support outside
the U.S.

Notes: Sample includes all individuals between 26 and 65 years of age. Dependent variable is the normalized average literacy skill test score. Control variables
are age, age squared, country-specific ability, and a country-specific indicator for female. School’s contributions to literacy skills for different cohorts are the
coefficient estimates on the interactive terms between school education (measure by years of education at primary and secondary schools) and indicators for the
respective age cohorts. College’s contributions to literacy skills for different cohorts are the coefficient estimates on the interactive terms between college
education (measure by years of education at tertiary schools) and indicators for the respective age cohorts. P-value (<tertiary) and p-value (tertiary) are for the Ftests that years of school less than tertiary and tertiary contribute the same over the four cohorts to literacy skill.
