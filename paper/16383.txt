ABSTRACT
The potentially serious adverse impacts of behavior problems during adolescence on employment
outcomes in adulthood provide a key economic rationale for early intervention programs. However,
the extent to which lower educational attainment accounts for the total impact of adolescent behavior
problems on later employment remains unclear As an initial step in exploring this issue, we specify
and estimate a recursive bivariate probit model that 1) relates middle school behavior problems to
high school graduation and 2) models later employment in young adulthood as a function of these
behavior problems and of high school graduation. Our model thus allows for both a direct effect of
behavior problems on later employment as well as an indirect effect that operates via graduation from
high school. Our empirical results, based on analysis of data from the NELS, suggest that the direct
effects of externalizing behavior problems on later employment are not significant but that these problems
have important indirect effects operating through high school graduation.

1. INTRODUCTION
The impact of children's behavioral or "noncognitive" traits on future labor market
outcomes has been of interest for economists and other social scientists (Heckman, Rubinstein,
2001; Bowles, Gintis, Osborne, 2001; Farkas, 2003; Heckman, Stixrud, Urzua, 2006). Previous
studies indicates that adolescent behavioral problems, such as persistent rule-breaking,
aggressive or antisocial behaviors, low motivation for school, alcohol and illicit substance use,
and delinquent acts, are associated with higher unemployment and lower earnings in adulthood
(Bowles, Gintis, Osborne, 2001; Cawley, Heckman, Vytlacil, 2001; Kokko, Pulkkinen, 2000;
Woodward and Fergusson, 2000). This study adds to the literature by examining the relative
importance of direct and indirect relationships between behavioral problems in adolescence and
employment status in early adulthood.
The relative importance of the direct versus indirect impacts of behavioral problems on
adult employment has possible implications for investment in prevention programs. If negative
impacts are primarily due to lower educational attainment, interventions that improve high
school graduation rates (or delay discontinuation of education among at risk youths) may have
long-term benefits in terms of future employment and earnings. On the other hand, if behavioral
problems primarily affect distal labor market outcomes via direct impacts of noncognitive traits
and skills, interventions that focus on keeping students in school despite behavioral problems
may not substantially improve labor market outcomes. That would require programs that
ameliorate behavioral problems, or early intervention programs that prevent development of
these problems.
We use data from a nationally representative cohort in 1988 of eighth-grade students who
were followed up in 2000, at ages 25 to 28, to model the effects of early adolescent behavior

1

problems on employment status in early adulthood. Unlike prior studies (e.g., Kokko,
Pulkkinen, 2000; Woodward, Fergusson, 2000), our model allows for both direct and indirect
effects of behavioral problems in 8th grade (1988) on early adulthood employment; indirect
effects operate via the probability of graduating from high school. We estimate model
parameters via maximum likelihood estimation of a recursive bivariate probit regression with
potentially correlated errors (Greene, 2003, Cameron, Trivedi, 2005). The bivariate probit model
explicitly allows for the possibility that educational attainment is endogenous to employment
(Heckman, Stixrud, Urzua, 2006).
We obtain coefficient estimates using the unweighted NELS data since unweighted
estimators are consistent and more efficient than their weighted counterparts when the stratifying
variables are exogenous (Wooldridge, 2002).
Behavioral problems, educational attainment, and employment
Because maladaptive behaviors may cause lower educational attainment, they could
indirectly affect employment in adulthood via effects on educational attainment. High schools
require a minimal level of compliance with rules that some students cannot achieve or may be
unwilling to tolerate, which may explain the negative association of behavioral problems in
adolescence with high school completion and college attendance (Fergusson, Horwood,
Woodward, 2001; Woodward, Fergusson, 2000; Alexander, Entwisle, Horsey, 1997; Ensminger,
Slusarcick, 1992; Ensminger, Lamkin, Jacobson, 1996; Brooks-Gunn, 1993; French, Conrad,
2001). The literature indicates that high school graduation raises earnings and increases the
probability of employment (e.g., Geweke, Keane, 2000; Heckman, 2000; Hamburg 1974,
Steinberg, Lerner 2004). Thus, an indirect structural relationship between adolescent behavioral
problems and employment outcomes in adulthood may be important.

2

However, most previous empirical work has not examined this structural relationship (e.g.,
Kokko, Pulkkinen, 2000; Woodward, Fergusson, 2000; Vitaro, Larocque, et al. 2001; Capaldi,
Chamberlain, Patterson, 1997; Jimerson, Egeland, et al. 2000; McLeod, J.D., Kaiser, K. 2004).
Instead, measures of behavior problems and educational attainment were modeled in the same
single equation specification for employment. The resulting estimates thus only reflect direct
effects of behavioral traits on employment, with the measure of educational attainment absorbing
the indirect effect of behavioral problems on employment outcomes.
Direct effects of behavioral problems on employment may occur because employers’ value
adherence to norms of conduct in the workplace (Bowles, Gintis and Osborne, 2001).
Employers may be less willing to employ individuals with behavioral problems, because
maladaptive behavior may interfere with performance or generate higher incidental costs to the
employer. Childhood problems are directly related to these effects, because problems adapting to
requisite norms of behavior in adulthood typically are evident during childhood (Hofstra, van der
Ende, and Verhulst, 2002). However, employers can not usually observe whether potential
employees had behavioral problems while at middle or high school. The educational screening
hypothesis suggests that employers use education to screen for exogenous ability differences.
Thus, they infer some unobservable factors, such as extent of middle-school behavioral
problems, from the observable facts of high-school graduation or number of years of completed
schooling (Riley, 1979; Weiss, 1995; Martorell, Clark, 2009).
Gender Differences
Descriptive comparisons suggest that relationships between adolescent behavioral
problems, educational attainment, and employment outcomes in early adulthood may differ by
gender. Females have higher rates of high school graduation and lower rates of employment in

3

their 20s (Swanson, 2004; Kienzl, Kena, 2006), suggesting that processes linking these outcomes
may differ by gender. Additionally, studies document the higher prevalence rates among boys
than girls of delinquency, physical aggression, and overt antisocial behaviors (Baillargeon et al.,
2007; Verhulst et al., 2003; Black, 2000; Pursell, et al. 2008). Finally, studies from the labor
economics literature (Altonji, Blank, 1999), and on labor market impacts of cognitive and
behavioral factors (Murnane, Willett, Levy, 1995; Heckman, Stixrud, Urzua, 2006; Cawley,
Heckman, Vytlacil, 2001) document significant gender differences (or restrict their analyses to
only one gender). Accordingly, we estimate separate models for males and females. (We tested
pooled vs. gender-specific models on our data and clearly rejected pooling: results are available
from the authors.)
2. METHODS
Estimation Model
In our model, employment outcome depends on observable covariates (X1), high school
graduation, and an unobservable random error term u1. We assume high school graduation
probability depends on a set of observable covariates (X2) and an unobservable error term u2. We
assume that u1 and u2 have a bivariate normal distribution with correlation ρ. In our initial
analyses, the same covariates were included in X1 and X2. Subsequent analyses tested the
stability of our principal findings when selected covariates were deleted from X1. Note that the
recursive structure of the model provides identification for the purposes of FIML estimation;
further exclusion restrictions on the X1 vector are not required (Wilde, 2000).
The from of the model estimated was:
Prob (HS=1| X2) = Prob [(β2X2 + u1)>0, Prob (EMP=1|HS, X1) = Prob [(β1X1 + β3HS+ u2,)>0],

4

where β1 and β2 are the coefficient vectors for X1 and X2, β3 is the coefficient for HS, and u1 and
u2 are random draws from a bivariate normal distribution with corr(u1, u2)=ρ. A positive value
for the correlation between the error terms, ρ, indicates that unobservables positively (negatively)
related to the probability of high school graduation also increase (decrease) the probability of
employment; negative values for ρ imply that unobservables have oppositely-signed influences
on graduation and employment. Full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) (using Stata
Version 9) is used for estimation.
Data Source, Variables, and Sample
Analysis is based on the data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS)
from the base year (1988) through the fifth follow-up (2000) (12,144 cases) (Curtin et al. 2002).
Employment and high-school graduation data are from the 2000 and 1994 waves, respectively.
All other data are from the 1988 baseline survey. Because of missing data from parents, teachers
and/or schools, 9,660 cases were available for analysis; deletion of cases where data were
reported, but values for specific variables used in our analysis were missing, resulted in a final
study sample of 8,405 subjects (3,927 males and 4,478 females).
The outcome variables high school graduation and employment are binary variables. We
define high school graduation in a time window of up to 6 years after eighth grade (i.e., using the
1994 NELS data) to include those who were delayed in completing high school. For most
models, we did not include a GED as equivalent to a high school diploma because of evidence
that labor market returns to a high school diploma are significantly higher than returns to GED
certification (Cameron and Heckman, 1993), and that the post-schooling labor-market outcomes
for GED recipients more closely match those of high-school dropouts (Heckman and Rubinstein,
2001; Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua, 2006). Thus, in most specifications, we contrast

5

employment for high school graduates with a reference group of GED recipients and dropouts.
(We also report results of sensitivity analyses with GED recipients coded as high school
graduates.)
The employment outcome is an indicator of current employment for the 2000 survey year.
Those who report current employment for pay in either a full-time or part-time job are coded as
employed. (Results for models that define the employment outcome as = 1 only for full-time
workers are discussed below in our presentation of sensitivity analyses.)
Explanatory variables pertain to behavior problems, academic performance,
demographic/socio-economic background, and school characteristics. Information on behavior
problems was obtained from teacher reports and student self-report. While this information was
not derived from psychometrically validated scales, such as the Behavior Problems Index (BPI)
(Zill, 1985), that have been used previously in economic research (e.g., Jones et al., 1999), the
NELS data items could be viewed as roughly consistent with the two major dimensions of
behavior problems (i.e., externalizing vs. internalizing) identified in the BPI. In particular, the
NELS responses include one teacher-reported measure on student passivity in class, which could
be regarded as potentially related to internalizing problems, as well as several items that are
presumably related to externalizing problems: teacher reports on whether the student is
frequently absent, and whether (s)he is disruptive class; and student-reported measures on
skipping class and on being sent to the principal’s office for misbehaving in class.
Academic performance variables (as of eighth grade) were obtained from teacher reports or
student-self-reports. They include the student’s grade point average (GPA), teacher rating of the
student’s academic performance compared to his/her ability, and student self-report on whether
(s)he had to repeat a grade.

6

Demographic/socio-economic background variables include race, presence of both
biological parents, caregiver’s employment status and educational attainment, and family
income. The NELS school characteristics variables were obtained from school records (for
attendance rate) and geocoding (for urban location).
3. RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 reports mean values for dependent and explanatory variables by gender. High
school graduation as of 1994 is reported by more than 89 percent of study subjects, while current
employment is reported by 92.1 percent of males and 82.7 percent of females. Other gender
differences are clear from the data. While males and females report similar high-school
graduation rates, females reported higher standardized grade point averages, lower rates of
repeating a year by 8th grade. Females were less likely to be rated by teachers as performing
below ability. Males were more likely to be rated as being disruptive in class, and more likely to
self-report skipping class and being sent to the office for misbehaving. While females were more
likely to be reported as being frequently absent by their teachers, there is little gender difference
in teacher-rated passive behavior in class. Males were more likely to report behavioral problems
that are closely associated with attention and focus in classroom activities.
With regard to socio-demographic characteristics, about 71 percent of our study subjects
were white. About 70 percent of the subjects reported living with both biological parents, 90
percent reported having an employed caregiver, and the mean annual household income level
exceded $40,000. Slightly over 10 percent of respondents did not have at least one caregiver who
had completed high school; just under 20 percent reported at least one caregiver who completed
high school but no caregivers with any post-high-school education.

Regression Results for Males
Regression results were obtained with three similar but slightly different specifications for
the employment model. One model regressed all covariates listed in Table 1, as well as the high
school graduation outcome variable, on the employment outcome. Results indicated that the
covariate for average attendance rate in eighth grade was clearly insignificant in the employment
outcome model, so a second regression was estimated with this covariate excluded from the
employment outcome model. In this case, the remaining school characteristic variable, the urban
school dummy, was not quite significant in the employment outcome model, so a third variant
was estimated in which both school characteristics variables were excluded from the
employment outcome model. (In all three cases, both school characteristics were included in the
high school graduate outcome model and were clearly significant.) In presenting our results in
detail, we focus here on the results from the regressions with this third variant of the employment
outcome model; comparisons with results with the first two variants of the employment outcome
model are examined in our sensitivity analyses.
Using the third variant of our employment outcome model, Table 2 presents the simple and
bivariate probit regression results for males. Simple probit estimates (in columns 1 through 4)
ignore any possible correlation between the unobservables that affect high school completion and
those that affect employment. Simple probit results for high school completion indicate highly
significant coefficients for almost all covariates. Corresponding results for employment show a
large and significant positive coefficient for high school graduation, but a significantly negative
coefficient for grade-point average. Among the behavior problem variables, the only significant
result is the negative coefficient for teacher-rated passivity in class. A joint likelihood ratio test
for all behavior problem variables (as predictors of employment) approached significance (P =

8

0.0731) reflecting the importance of passivity as a negative predictor of employment; excluding
this variable from the joint test yielded a joint P-value for the remaining (externalizing) behavior
problem indicators of 0.8879. Among the remaining covariates, being white and living with both
parents were significant and positive predictors of being employed. Conversely, family income
had a significantly negative coefficient. One possible explanation for this negative relationship
is that young adults whose parents had higher income can afford to postpone employment after
high school and perhaps continue their education while continuing to rely on parental financial
support. However, males whose most highly-educated caregiver received a high school diploma
but no further education were significantly less likely to be employed relative to those with at
least one caregiver with any post-high school education.
In the bivariate probit analysis for males, the results for high school graduation are very
similar in sign, size and significance to the results in the simple probit model. In the employment
equation, the bivariate coefficient on high school completion is substantially larger than in the
simple probit model. Other employment results, however, parallel the findings for the simple
probit model. Among the behavior problem variables, only teacher-rated passivity is significant.
While all behavior problem variables have negative coefficients, as a group they only approach
significance (P=0.0682). However, the joint P-value for the externalizing behavior problem
variables (i.e., excluding passivity from the test) becomes clearly insignificant (p=0.9372). We
again find that grade-point average is negatively related to employment and that students whose
caregivers have post-high-school education are less likely to be employed (relative to children of
caregivers with no post-high school education).
The bivariate probit regression provides an estimate of ρ (rho), the correlation between
unobservables affecting high school graduation and those affecting employment decision. The

9

estimated ρ is negative and statistically significant (p=0.013). Thus, unobserved factors that are
associated with higher probability of high school graduation are also predictive of a lower
likelihood of employment during transition to adulthood. This implies a negative bias in the
estimated effect of high school graduation on employment outcome for males, and is consistent
with our finding of a smaller coefficient of high school graduation in the simple probit model of
employment compared to the bivariate probit model.
In comparison to these results, bivariate probit regression with both school characteristics
included in both outcome models, yielded P-values of 0.048 and 0.662 for the urban school
dummy and the attendance rate respectively in the employment outcome model. When the
attendance rate was excluded, the P-value for the urban school dummy fell to 0.051. (A variant
of the employment outcome model with the urban school dummy excluded but the attendance
rate included, yielded a P-value of 0.743 for the coefficient of the latter variable.) We tested the
restriction that both school characteristics have no direct effect on the employment outcome and
obtained an insignificant P-Value of 0.137. In all cases, the regression results for other
explanatory variables in both outcome models were virtually unchanged.
Regression Results for Females
The specification of the regression models for females parallels that for males described
above. Since the variants that included (1) both school characteristics, or (2) just the urban
school dummy yielded clearly insignificant coefficients for school characteristics in the
employment outcome models, we present in detail the results obtained when school
characteristics are not used as predictors of employment outcomes. (See Table 3.) As in the case
of males, most coefficients in the simple probit model of high school graduation are significant
and plausibly signed. Once again the problem behavior indicators that may be viewed as

10

indicative of externalizing behavior problems are significantly negative while the indicator of
passive behavior is again insignificant. However, apart from the significant positive coefficient
for family income, the influences of family background characteristics on graduation probability
appear to be slightly weaker for females than for males. An unexpected gender difference is that
the sign of the significant coefficient for the urban school dummy is positive, while it was
negative for males. This may reflect differing urban vs. rural patterns in availability of low-skill
employment for males vs. females; further exploration of this pattern is warranted.
Simple probit results for the employment regression also show some interesting differences
with the findings for males. High school graduation is a positive and significant predictor of
employment, but the same is true of grade point average, while females who repeated a grade are
significantly less likely to have been employed. Most behavior problem variables are
insignificant, but the negative coefficients for being frequently absent and for being disruptive in
class are, respectively, significant and approaching significance. A joint likelihood ratio test on
all the behavior problem variables yielded a p-value of 0.0656. A similar p-value (0.0598) is
obtained when the passive behavior variable is excluded from this test. Family background
characteristics are also not significant predictors of employment, with the only exceptions being
the positive effect of living with both parents and the negative result for high-school educated
caregivers (relative to the reference group with some post-high-school education).
Bivariate probit results for the high school graduation model (columns 5 and 6) closely
parallel the simple probit results. Our two school characteristics covariates have statistically
significant coefficients (p<0.05) with positive signs as expected. Educational achievement
variables are also significant and have the expected signs. Study subjects with relatively higher
GPAs in eighth grade are significantly more likely to graduate from high school. Similarly, those

11

who repeated a grade (prior to 8th grade) and those reported by teachers as performing below
ability are significantly less likely to complete high school. Among the behavioral problem
indicators, being frequently absent, being disruptive in class, self-report of regularly skipping
class, and being sent to the office for misbehaving, are all significant (p<0.05) with expected
negative coefficients. Being passive in class again is clearly insignificant. Living with both
parents has a positive and significant coefficient (p=0.029). In addition, students with no
caregiver who completed high school are less likely to graduate from high school relative to
those with a caregiver with any education beyond high school (p<0.01). Subjects, whose
caregiver had only a high school diploma also appear less likely to graduate from high school
compared with study subjects whose caregivers had education beyond high school, though this
difference was not significant. Family income was a significant and positive predictor of high
school graduation (p<0.01) while the coefficient for having an employed caregiver was positive
and marginally significant.
Bivariate probit employment results (in columns 7 and 8) show some differences from the
simple probit results. We obtain a larger positive and significant coefficient for high school
graduation (p<0.05), but other educational achievement variables are no longer significant.
Among behavioral problem indicators, being sent to office for misbehaving is marginally
significant (p=0.062) and is (unexpectedly) positive. All other behavioral problem indicators
have the expected negative coefficients but all are statistically insignificant. A joint likelihood
ratio test on inclusion of the behavior problem variables yielded a P-value of 0.1319 in the
bivariate model. (A similar p-value (0.1299) is obtained when the passive behavior variable is
excluded from this test.) Results for other covariates parallel the simple probit results.

12

The bivariate probit estimate of ρ is negative but not statistically significant. This is
consistent with the greater stability (compared to males) of the high school graduation results in
the simple and bivariate probit models for employment.
When both school characteristics were included in both outcome models, bivariate probit
estimation yielded P-values of 0.721 and 0.178 for the urban school dummy and the attendance
rate respectively in the employment outcome model. When the attendance rate was excluded
from this model, the P-value for the urban school dummy coefficient was still clearly
insignificant (P=0.673). (When the urban school dummy was excluded but the attendance rate
included in the employment model, we obtained a P-value of 0.172 for the coefficient of the
latter variable.) We the restriction that both school characteristics have no direct effect on the
employment outcome could not be rejected (P-Value of 0.362). In all cases, the regression results
for other explanatory variables were virtually unchanged from those reported in Table 3.
Estimated Marginal Effects of Behavior and Academic Indicators
To examine the magnitudes of the impacts of behavior problems and academic progress
indicators on outcomes, we computed the sample mean values for changes in the probabilities of
these outcomes predicted to result from changes in our behavior and academic indicators. For
example, to compute the impact of having repeated a grade (by the time a student was in eighth
grade) on the probability of high school graduation we used our estimated coefficients for high
school graduation to predict graduation probabilities for each respondent 1) assuming they had
not repeated a grade and 2) assuming they had repeated a grade. The difference in the sample
means for these two probabilities was our measure of the direct influence of repeating a grade on
the probability of high school graduation. (For both sets of predicted probabilities, other
explanatory variables for each respondent were set at their actually observed values.) To

13

compute the total (direct plus indirect) influence of repeating a grade on the probability of
employment, we computed for each respondent the change in the predicted probability of
employment resulting from two changes in the predictors of employment: 1) a change from not
having repeated a grade to having repeated a grade and 2) the change in the predicted probability
of high-school graduation for that respondent resulting from repeating a grade. Combining these
changes for each respondent with their actual values for all other predictors and with the
coefficients from our bivariate probit employment regressions, we computed that change in
employment probability for each respondent. The sample mean value of the latter change
indicates the total influence on employment probability of having to repeat a grade.
We also computed the mean estimated indirect effect of each variable on employment.
For each individual this effect for each variable was computed in two steps. We first used the
estimated coefficient from the bivariate probit employment regression to compute the estimated
direct effect on employment, holding the high school graduation variable constant at its observed
level. We then computed the estimated indirect effect as the difference between the estimated
total employment effect for that variable and the estimated direct effect.
The results of these calculations are in Table 4. Estimated employment impacts for each
variable are generally small in magnitude (the maximum absolute value is 0.0617). The
estimated high school graduation effects are somewhat larger but in several instances the signs of
the coefficients in the high school graduation and employment bivariate probit regressions are
opposite, tending to produce small total employment impacts. Also, a number of the estimates in
Table 4 (in columns 3 through 6) are based on coefficient point estimates that are small and
imprecise. It seems reasonable to expect that confidence intervals for these estimates (which

14

could be computed by complete bootstrapping of the entire estimation process) would be fairly
wide.
Sensitivity Analysis Results
The stability of the results reported in Tables 2 and 3 above were tested by estimating a
variety of alternative models. Three variants of the employment outcome specification were
tested: one including both school characteristics as covariates, one including only the urban
school dummy, and one excluding both (which was used for the regressions in Tables 2 and 3).
We re-estimated our regressions with each of these three variants using two other modifications.
In the first, we redefined our high school graduation outcome to include persons with a GED.
This assumes that the high school graduate and GED groups can be treated as homogeneous
while dropouts groups serve as the reference group. In the second, we excluded persons in our
study samples who reported that they were full-time students in the year 2000. This relaxes the
potentially important assumption that the impact of high school graduation on employment
probability 8 years later is invariant to the factors that induce some persons to extend their fulltime schooling to the 8-year follow-up time point. The foregoing implies a total of 9 different
specifications for testing the stability of our results.
Tables 5 and 6 report the range of our employment outcome coefficient estimates (and the
associated P-values) across all 9 models for the high school graduation dummy, the other
educational achievement variables, and the behavior problem variables. For bivariate
regressions, we also report the range of estimates and for the random disturbance correlation
(rho). (Full results are available from the authors.)
For the behavior problem variables, our estimates and P-values tend to be very stable for
both genders across all different specifications. While some coefficient magnitudes change, none

15

show substantial changes in significance or changes in sign (except for a few cases of very small
coefficients with very high P-values).
Coefficient estimates for other variables are generally stable though slightly more variable
across the specifications. In bivariate probit regressions, the high school graduation coefficient
falls in size and significance when full-time students are excluded from the analysis; note,
however, that these weaker results for high school graduation are obtained in models in where
the estimated rho is also at its smallest magnitude and is clearly insignificant. This suggests that
the coefficient estimates for these models are inefficient; by contrast, the corresponding simple
probit results for these same employment outcome models show highly significant high school
graduation coefficient estimates. Considering the other three educational achievement covariates,
the most notable variation in results pertained to the grade point average variable. The negative
coefficient of this variable for males fell substantially in magnitude and significance in both the
simple and bivariate probit results when full-time students were excluded from the analysis. For
females, excluding full-time students resulted in larger positive and more significant coefficient
for this variable.
In summary, our sensitivity analyses do not indicate substantial variability in our main
findings across the 9 different specifications that we tested. This is consistent with several facts
about our study sample. First, the fraction of GED holders is relatively small, 3.9 percent for
males and 3.8 percent for females. Second, the employment rate among full-time students in the
year 2000 is relatively high (77.19 per cent) and the number of full-time students is small (14.77
per cent).
One additional sensitivity analysis was carried out using the specifications reported in
Tables 2 and 3 but defining the employment outcome as = 1only for persons who were employed

16

full-time. Results for the employment probits (available from the authors) were fairly robust to
this change in specification. For males, the estimated coefficient for repeating a grade became
positive in both simple and bivariate employment probits, and significant in the latter. For
females, in the bivariate employment results, the coefficient for grade point average became
significant. None of the qualitative results for the behavior problem variables was substantially
altered; the most notable change was a decline in size and significance of the bivariate
coefficient for females for being sent to the office for misbehaving.
4. DISCUSSION
Results from the probit regressions (Tables 2 and 3) indicate generally significant or nearly
significant effects of behavior problems in early adolescence on the probability of high school
graduation, but much less significant effects of these problems, conditional on high school
graduation, on the probability of employment approximately 8 years later. This general
conclusion holds for both males and females, but an exception is the significant negative direct
effect of classroom passivity on future employment for males. This result accords with recent
developmental models (Rubin, Burgess, Kennedy, 2003) that indicate social withdrawal among
school age children is associated with establishment of negative peer reputations, peer rejection,
and unpopularity. Social withdrawal could consequently be associated with multiple
interpersonal and emotional difficulties in interpersonal that limit employment in adulthood.
The significant results for behavior problems in the high school graduation regressions,
combined with insignificant results in the employment regression, supports the educational
screening/signaling hypothesis that employers make judgments about prospective employees’
productivity from readily observable indicators such as high school graduation or years of

17

completed schooling (Riley, 1979; Weiss, 1995). This pattern of results may also have
implications for strategy in evaluating interventions directed at preventing or ameliorating
behavior problems. While long-term economic benefits of these programs on post-educational
labor market outcomes may be important, much of their impact on post-high school labor market
outcomes can be captured by the projected long term effects of high school graduation on labor
market outcomes. We illustrate this point quantitatively by using the results in Tables 2 and 3 to
compute the combined total and indirect impacts of our five dichotomous indicators of behavior
problems on future employment probability (in Table 4). The indirect impact estimates
correspond to estimates based on the proximal outcome (high school graduation) while the total
estimates incorporate both proximal and distal impacts. For males, the indirect and total
employment impact estimates of all behavior problems combined were respectively -0.067 and 0.106. The corresponding estimates for all externalizing behavior problems combined (i.e.,
excluding the passive behavior dummy) were -0.046 and -0.031. Analogous figures for females
for all behavior problems combined were -0.091 and -0.133, and for all externalizing problems
combined were -0.090 and -0.108. As noted above, these impact estimates are based on point
estimates for some coefficients that are not precisely estimated, especially the coefficients of
behavior problems in the employment regressions.
We also find some evidence that unobservable factors have opposite effects on our two
outcomes, implying endogeneity of high-school graduation in the employment regressions. This
is most clearly true for males, but a similar result emerges for females in regressions when
insignificant behavioral and academic predictors are deleted from the bivariate probit
employment models (results available on request from the authors). This influence of

18

unobservables may be related to post-high-school continuation of schooling for some
respondents.
The stronger evidence for males of unobservables that jointly affect graduation and
employment could be related to gender differences in the returns to schooling for occupations
that tend to attract males versus females. Studies report that males who drop out of high school
have higher skills in the kinds of jobs that do not require a high school diploma (Eckstein,
Wolpin, 1999). For male dropouts, an extra year of schooling could have a higher opportunity
cost of potential earnings in well paid blue-collar jobs, at least during early adulthood. Lower
expected returns to a high school diploma may encourage male low-ability students to
discontinue their education and accept employment at an earlier age.
Several limitations of our research should also be noted. The NELS measures of behavior
problems are relatively crude compared to behavior measures based on the more extensive
questions found in widely used psychological instruments such as the BPI (Jones et al., 1999).
The limitations of the NELS measures may have contributed to the insignificant results in the
employment regressions; conversely the significance of these NELS measures in the high school
graduation regressions may be enhanced because they measure behavior problems specifically in
the school and classroom context.
Another limitation is the fact that our labor market outcome measure is obtained in early
adulthood. It would be desirable to replicate our analysis with more precise labor market
measures (e.g., earnings) at later ages, after more respondents had completed post-high-school
schooling and had established a clearer work history and earnings trajectory. Measures of wages
or earnings may show more variation in later years because of differential returns to experience
in high-skill vs. low-skill jobs. Also, at later ages employers have more opportunity to make

19

inferences about employees’ cognitive and non-cognitive skills from direct observations on
employee productivity. It is interesting to note that a recent study using British data (Fronstin,
Greenberg, Robins, 2005) did report at least mixed evidence that behavior problems for males,
observed at age 16, may impact labor market outcomes observed at age 33. Results for females,
however, were somewhat weaker. (For both genders, behavior problem effects on wages were
somewhat stronger than effects on labor-force status and employment.)
5. CONCLUSIONS
We estimated the effects of behavioral problems during early adolescence on employment
during early adulthood. We used FIML to estimate a recursive bivariate probit model to control
for direct effects of behavioral problems on employment as well as the indirect effects through
endogenous high school graduation. Our main finding is that middle-school behavior problems
were strongly and negatively related to the probability of having a high school diploma 6 years
later, but not to the probability of employment, conditional on high school graduation, 12 years
later. Results were consistent across both genders; they indicate that effects of behavior problems
on high school graduation can account for a substantial portion of the more distal economic
impacts on employment status in young adulthood. The practical implication is that more timely
evaluations of early prevention programs, based on shorter follow-up periods, can provide useful
assessments. Timeliness is a virtue in this context for reasons of cost and for enabling more
rapid dissemination of effective programs.
The limitations of our data and measures, however, imply that these results are tentative.
Further analyses of long-term follow-up data, including analyses linked directly to preventive
interventions in young childhood or early adolescence, are needed.
