Weather Forecasting for Weather Derivatives
Sean D. Campbell and Francis X. Diebold
NBER Working Paper No. 10141
December 2003
JEL No. G1
ABSTRACT
We take a simple time-series approach to modeling and forecasting daily average temperature in
U.S. cities, and we inquire systematically as to whether it may prove useful from the vantage point
of participants in the weather derivatives market. The answer is, perhaps surprisingly, yes. Timeseries modeling reveals both strong conditional mean dynamics and conditional variance dynamics
in daily average temperature, and it reveals sharp differences between the distribution of temperature
and the distribution of temperature surprises. The approach can easily be used to produce not only
short-horizon point forecasts, but also the long-horizon density forecasts of maximal relevance in
weather derivatives contexts. We produce and evaluate both, with some success. We conclude that
additional inquiry into nonstructural weather forecasting methods will likely prove useful in weather
derivatives contexts.

1. Introduction
Weather derivatives are a fascinating new type of Arrow-Debreu security, making pre-specified
payouts if pre-specified weather events occur. The market has grown rapidly. In 1997, the market for
weather derivatives was nonexistent. In 1998 the market was estimated at $500 million, but it was still
illiquid, with large spreads and limited secondary market activity. More recently the market has grown to
more than $5 billion, with better liquidity. Outlets such as the Weather Risk (e.g., 1998, 2000) supplements
to Risk Magazine and volumes such as Geman (1999) have chronicled the development.
Weather derivative instruments include weather swaps, vanilla options, option collars, and exotic
(e.g., path-dependent) options. The underlying include heating degree days, cooling degree days, growing
degree days, average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation (rainfall,
snowfall), humidity and sunshine, among others – even the National Weather Service's temperature forecast
for the coming week. Most trading is over-the-counter, but exchange-based trading is gaining momentum.
Temperature-related weather derivatives, for example, are actively traded on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) for ten major U.S. cities.
A number of interesting considerations make weather derivatives different from “standard”
derivatives. First, the underlying object (weather) is not traded in a spot market. Second, unlike financial
derivatives, which are useful for price hedging but not quantity hedging, weather derivatives are useful for
quantity hedging but not necessarily for price hedging (although the two are obviously related). That is,
weather derivative products provide protection against weather-related changes in quantities,
complementing extensive commodity price risk management tools already available through futures.
Third, although liquidity in weather derivative markets has improved, it will likely never be as good as in
traditional commodity markets, because weather is by its nature a location-specific and non-standardized
commodity, unlike, say, a specific grade of crude oil.
Weather derivatives are also different from insurance. First, there is no need to file a claim or
prove damages. Second, there is little moral hazard, although there is some, as when someone with a long

precipitation position attempts to seed the clouds. (Don’t laugh – it has happened!) Third, unlike
insurance, weather derivatives allow one to hedge against comparatively good weather in other locations,
which may be bad for local business (e.g., a bumper crop of California oranges may lower the prices
received by Florida growers).
Weather forecasting is crucial to both the demand and supply sides of the weather derivatives
market. Consider first the demand side: any firm exposed to weather risk either on the output (revenue)
side or the input (cost) side is a candidate for productive use of weather derivatives. This includes obvious
players such as energy companies, utilities and insurance companies, and less obvious players such as ski
resorts, grain millers, cities facing snow-removal costs, consumers who want fixed heating and air
conditioning bills, and firms seeking to avoid financial writedowns due to weather-driven poor
performance. The mere fact that such agents face weather fluctuations, however, does not ensure a large
hedging demand, because even very large weather fluctuations would create little weather risk if they were
highly predictable. Weather risk, then, is about the unpredictable component of weather fluctuations –
“weather surprises,” or “weather noise.” To assess the potential for hedging against weather surprises, and
to formulate the appropriate hedging strategies, one needs to determine how much weather noise exists for
weather derivatives to eliminate, and that requires a weather model. What does weather noise look like
over space and time? What are its conditional and unconditional distributions? Answering such questions
requires statistical weather modeling and forecasting, the topic of this paper.
Now consider the supply side – sellers of weather derivatives who want to price them, arbitrageurs
who want to exploit situations of apparent mispricing, etc. How should weather derivatives be priced? It
seems clear that standard approaches to arbitrage-free pricing (e.g., Black-Scholes) are inapplicable in
weather derivative contexts. In particular, there is in general no way to construct a portfolio of financial
assets that replicates the payoff of a weather derivative. Hence the only way to price options reliably is by
using forecasts of the underlying weather variable, in conjunction with a utility function, as argued for
-2-

example by Davis (2001). This again raises the crucial issue of how to construct good weather forecasts
(not only point forecasts, but also, and crucially, complete density forecasts), potentially at horizons much
longer than those commonly emphasized by meteorologists. Hence the supply-side questions, as with the
demand-side questions, are intimately related to weather modeling and forecasting.
Curiously, however, it seems that little thought has been given to the crucial question of how best
to approach the weather modeling and forecasting that underlies weather derivative demand and supply.
The meteorological weather forecasting literature focuses primarily on short-horizon point forecasts
produced from structural physical models of atmospheric conditions (see, for example, the overview in
Tribia, 1997). Although such an approach may well be best for helping one decide how warmly to dress
today, it is not at all obvious that it is best for producing the long-horizon density forecasts relevant for
weather derivatives. In particular, successful forecasting does not necessarily require a structural model,
and in the last thirty years statisticians and econometricians have made great strides in using nonstructural
models of time-series trend, seasonal, cyclical components to produce good forecasts, including longhorizon density forecasts. (For a broad overview see Diebold, 2004.)
In this paper, then, motivated by considerations related to the weather derivatives market, we take a
nonstructural time-series approach to weather modeling and forecasting, systematically asking whether it
proves useful. We are not the first to adopt a time-series approach, although the literature is sparse and
inadequate for our purposes. The analyses of Harvey (1989), Hyndman and Grunwald (2000), Milionis and
Davies (1994), Visser and Molenaar (1995), Jones (1996), and Pozo et al. (1998) suggest its value, for
example, but they do not address the intra-year temperature forecasting relevant to our concerns. Seater
(1993) studies long-run temperature trend, but little else. Cao and Wei (2001) and Torro, Meneu and Valor
(2001) – each of which was written independently of the present paper – consider time-series models of
average temperature, but their models are more restrictive and their analyses more limited.
We progress by providing insight into both conditional mean dynamics and conditional variance
-3-

dynamics of daily average temperature as relevant for weather derivatives; strong conditional variance
dynamics are a central part of the story. We also highlight the differences between the distributions of
weather and weather surprises. Finally, we evaluate the performance of time series point and density
forecasts as relevant for weather derivatives. The results are mixed but encouraging, and they point toward
directions that may yield future forecasting improvements. We proceed as follows. In Section 2 we
discuss our data and our focus on modeling and forecasting daily average temperature, and we report the
results of time-series modeling. In section 3 we report the results of out-of-sample point and density
forecasting exercises. In section 4 we offer concluding remarks and sketch directions for future research.
2. Time Series Weather Data and Modeling
We begin by discussing our choice of weather data and its collection. We are interested in daily
average temperature (T), which is widely reported and followed. Moreover, the heating degree days
(HDDs) and cooling degree days (CDDs) on which weather derivatives are commonly written are simple
transformations of daily average temperature. We directly model and forecast daily average temperature,
measured in degrees Fahrenheit, for each of four measurement stations (Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas,
Philadelphia) for 1/1/60 through 11/05/01, resulting in 15,285 observations per measurement station. Each
of the cities is one of the ten for which temperature-related weather derivatives are traded at the CME. In
an earlier and longer version of this article, Campbell and Diebold (2002), we report results for all ten
cities, which are qualitatively identical. We obtained the data from Earth Satellite (EarthSat) corporation;
they are precisely those used to settle temperature-related weather derivative products traded on the CME.
The primary underlying data source is the National Climactic Data Center (NCDC), a division of the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Each of the measurement stations supplies its
data to the NCDC, and those data are in turn collected by EarthSat.
Before proceeding to detailed modeling and forecasting results, it is useful to get an overall feel for
the daily average temperature data. In Figure 1 we plot the daily average temperature series for the last five
-4-

years of the sample. The time-series plots reveal strong and unsurprising seasonality in average
temperature: in each city, the daily average temperature moves repeatedly and regularly through periods of
high temperature (summer) and low temperature (winter). Importantly, however, the seasonal fluctuations
differ noticeably across cities both in terms of amplitude and detail of pattern.
In Figure 2 we show how the seasonality in daily average temperature manifests itself in
unconditional temperature densities. The densities are either bimodal or nearly so, with peaks characterized
by cool and warm temperatures. Also, with the exception of Las Vegas, each density is negatively skewed.
The distributional results are in line with von Storch and Zwiers (1999), who note that although daily
average temperature often appears Gaussian if studied over sufficiently long times in the troposphere, daily
average surface temperatures may have different distributions, and with Neese (1994), who documents
skewness and bimodality in daily maximum temperatures.
The discussion thus far suggests that a seasonal component will be important in any time-series
model fit to daily average temperature, as average temperature displays pronounced seasonal variation,
with both the amplitude and precise seasonal patterns differing noticeably across cities. We use a lowordered Fourier series to model this seasonality, the benefits of which are two-fold. First, it produces a
smooth seasonal pattern, which accords with the basic intuition that the progression through different
seasons is gradual rather than discontinuous. Second, it promotes parsimony, which enhances numerical
stability in estimation. Such considerations are of relevance given the rather large size of our dataset
(roughly 15,000 daily observations for each of four cities) and the numerical optimization that we
subsequently perform.
One naturally suspects that non-seasonal factors may also be operative in the dynamics of daily
average temperature. One such factor is trend, which may be relevant but is likely minor, given the short
forty-year span of our data. We therefore simply allow for a simple low-ordered polynomial deterministic
trend. Another such factor is cycle, by which we mean any sort of persistent covariance stationary
-5-

dynamics apart from seasonality and trend. We capture cyclical dynamics using autoregressive lags.
The discussion thus far has focused on conditional mean dynamics, with contributions coming
from trend, seasonal and cyclical components. We also allow for conditional variance (volatility)
dynamics, with contributions coming from both seasonal and cyclical components. We approximate the
seasonal volatility component using a Fourier series, and we approximate the cyclical volatility component
using a GARCH process (Engle, 1982; Bollerslev, 1986). Assembling the various pieces, we estimate the
following daily average temperature model for each of our four cities:
(1)
where
(1a)
(1b)
(1c)
,

(1d)

and d(t) is a repeating step function that cycles through 1, ..., 365. In all that follows we set L=25, M=1,
P=3, Q=3, R=1, and S=1, which both Akaike and Schwarz information criteria indicate are more than
adequate for each city. Maintaining the rather large value of L=25 costs little given the large number of
available degrees of freedom, and it helps to capture long-memory dynamics, if present, as suggested by
results such as those of Bloomfield (1992). Following Bollerslev and Wooldridge (1992), we consistently
estimate this regression model with GARCH disturbances by Gaussian quasi maximum likelihood.
Now let us discuss the estimation results. First, and perhaps surprisingly, most cities display a
statistically significant trend in daily average temperature. In most cases, the trend is much larger than the
increase in average global temperature over the same period. For example, the results indicate that the
daily average temperature in Atlanta has increased by three degrees in the last forty years. Such large trend
increases are likely a consequence of development and air pollution that increased urban temperatures in
-6-

general, and urban airport temperatures in particular, where most of the U.S. recording stations are located,
a phenomenon often dubbed the “heat island effect.” Second, the conditional mean seasonality is of course
statistically significant and crucially important. We plot the estimated Fourier seasonal pattern in Figure 3.
Third, daily average temperature displays strong cyclical persistence. The estimated autoregressions
display an interesting root pattern, common across all four cities, regardless of location. The dominant root
is large and real, around 0.85, the second and third roots are a conjugate pair with moderate modulus,
around .3, and all subsequent roots are much smaller in modulus.
In Figure 4 we show model residuals over the last five years of the estimation sample. The fit is
typically very good, with

above 90%. Figure 4 also provides a first glimpse of an important

phenomenon: pronounced and persistent time-series heteroskedasticity in the residuals. In particular,
weather risk, as measured by its innovation variance, appears seasonal, as the amplitude of the residual
fluctuations widens and narrows over the course of a year. It seems that such seasonal heteroskedasticity in
temperature was first noted, informally, in an economic context by Roll (1984). Subsequently in this paper
we propose quantitative models and forecasts that explicitly incorporate the heteroskedasticity.
In Figure 5 we show residual kernel density estimates for each of the models. Four features stand
out. First, average temperature residuals are much less variable than average temperature itself; that is,
weather surprises are much less variable than the weather itself, with residual standard deviations only one
third or so of the average temperature standard deviations. Second, the spreads of the residual densities
vary noticeably across cities, indicating that weather risk is much greater in some cities than in others.
Third, all of the residual densities are uni- as opposed to bi-modal, in contrast to the unconditional densities
examined earlier, due to the model’s success in capturing seasonal highs and lows. Fourth, all of the
residual densities have only moderate negative skewness and moderate excess kurtosis; the average residual
skewness and kurtosis coefficients are -0.36 and 4.10.
In Figures 6 and 7 we display the correlograms of the residuals and squared residuals, taken to a
-7-

maximum displacement of 800 days. The residual autocorrelations are negligible and appear consistent
with white noise, indicating that we have modeled linear dependence adequately. Figure 7, however,
reveals strong nonlinear residual dependence, driven by strong conditional variance dynamics.
In Figure 8 we plot the estimated residual conditional standard deviation from 1996 through 2001.
The basic pattern is one of strong seasonal volatility variation, with upward-brushing GARCH effects, the
persistence of which varies across cities. For each city, seasonal volatility appears highest during the
winter months. Among other things, this indicates that correct pricing of weather derivatives may in
general be crucially dependent on the season covered by the contract. Some cities display a great deal of
seasonal volatility variation – the conditional standard deviation of Atlanta temperature shocks, for
example, roughly triples each winter – whereas temperature shock volatility in other cities such as Las
Vegas varies less across seasons.
It is interesting to note that the upward-brushing GARCH volatility effects typically occur in
winter, when the volatility seasonal component is high, which might suggest the desirability of a
multiplicative volatility specification. Nelson’s (1991) exponential GARCH(1,1) is one attractive such
specification, replacing the volatility specification for
specification for

in equation (1c) with an alternative but related

. Estimation of exponential GARCH models, however, produced fitted conditional

variance series nearly identical to those of the original GARCH models.
In Figure 9 we show density estimates for the standardized residuals,

. The standardized

residual densities still displays negative skewness; the average across cities is -0.45. Modeling the
conditional heteroskedasticity does, however, reduce (but not completely eliminate) residual excess
kurtosis; the average across cities is now 3.74. Finally, in Figure 10 we show the correlogram of squared
standardized residuals; there is no significant deviation from white noise behavior, indicating that the fitted
model (1) is adequate.
3. Time-Series Weather Forecasting
-8-

Armed with a hopefully adequate nonstructural time-series model for daily average temperature,
we now proceed to examine its performance in out-of-sample weather forecasting. We begin by examining
its performance in short-horizon point forecasting, despite the fact that short horizons and point forecasts
are not of maximal relevance for weather derivatives, in order to compare our performance to that of a very
sophisticated leading meteorological forecast. One naturally suspects that the much larger information set
on which the meteorological forecast is based will result in superior short-horizon point forecasting
performance, but even if so, of great interest is the question of how quickly and with what pattern the
superiority of the meteorological forecast deteriorates with forecast horizon.
We then progress to assess the performance of our model’s long-horizon density forecasts, which
are of maximal interest in weather derivative contexts, given the underlying option pricing considerations.
Simultaneously, we also move to forecasting

rather than

. This lets us match the most common

weather derivative “underlying,” and it also lets us explore the effects of using a daily model to produce
much longer-horizon density forecasts.
Point Forecasting
We assess the short-term accuracy of daily average temperature forecasts based on our
seasonal+trend+cycle model. In what follows, we refer to those forecasts as “autoregressive forecasts,” for
obvious reasons. We evaluate the autoregressive forecasts relative to three benchmark competitors, which
range from rather naive to very sophisticated. The first benchmark forecast is a no-change forecast. The
no-change forecast, often called the “persistence forecast” in the climatological literature, is the minimum
mean squared error forecast at all horizons if daily average temperature follows a random walk.
The second benchmark forecast is from a more sophisticated two-component (seasonal+trend)
model. It captures (daily) seasonal effects via day-of-year dummy variables, in keeping with the common
climatological use of daily averages as benchmarks, and it captures trend via a simple linear deterministic
function of time. We refer to this forecast as the “climatological forecast.”
-9-

The third benchmark forecast, unlike benchmarks one and two, is not at all naive; on the contrary,
it is a highly sophisticated forecast produced in real time by EarthSat. To produce their forecast, EarthSat
meteorologists pool their expert judgement with model-based numerical weather prediction (NWP)
forecasts from the National Weather Service, as well as forecasts from European, Canadian, and U.S. Navy
weather services. This blending of judgement with models is typical of best-practice modern weather
forecasting.
We were able to purchase approximately two years of forecasts from EarthSat. The sample period
runs from 10/11/99, the date when EarthSat began to archive their forecasts electronically and make them
publically available, through 10/22/01. Each weekday, EarthSat makes a set of h-day ahead daily average
temperature forecasts, for h = 1, 2, ..., 11. EarthSat does not make forecasts on weekends.
We measure accuracy of all point forecasts using h-day-ahead root mean squared prediction error
(RMSPE). We assess point forecasting accuracy at horizons of h = 1, 2, ..., 11 days, because those are the
horizons at which EarthSat’s forecasts are available. We compute measures of the accuracy of our model
and the EarthSat model relative to that of the persistence and climatological benchmarks. RMPSE ratios
relative to benchmarks are called skill scores in the meteorological literature (Brier and Allen, 1951) and
U-statistics in the econometrics literature (Theil, 1966). Specifically, in an obvious notation, the skill score
relative to the persistence forecast is
the persistence forecast and

, where

is

is either the autoregressive forecast or the EarthSat forecast. The skill

score relative to the climatological forecast is

, where

denotes the climatological forecast,

, and

is a daily dummy.

A number of nuances merit discussion. First, for each of our time-series models, we estimate and
forecast recursively, using only the data that were available in real time. Thus our forecasts at any time
utilize no more average temperature information than do EarthSat’s. In fact, our forecasts are based on less
average temperature information: our forecast for day t+1 made on day t is based on daily average
-10-

temperature through 11:59 PM of day t, whereas the EarthSat forecast for day t+1, which is not released
until 6:45 AM on day t+1, potentially makes use of the history of temperature through 6:45 AM of day
t+1. Second, we make forecasts using our models only on the dates that EarthSat made forecasts. In
particular, we make no forecasts on weekends. Hence, our accuracy comparisons proceed by averaging
squared errors over precisely the same days as those corresponding to the EarthSat errors. This ensures a
fair apples-to-apples comparison.
We report RMSPEs in Table 1 at horizons of h = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 days, for all cities and
forecasting models. In addition, we graph skill scores as a function of horizon, against the persistence
forecast in Figure 11 and against the climatological forecast in Figure 12, for all cities and horizons. The
results are the same for all cities, so it is not necessary to discuss them individually by city. The results
most definitely do differ, however, across models and horizons, as we now discuss. We first discuss the
performance of the time-series forecasts, and then we discuss the EarthSat forecasts.
Let us consider first the forecasting performance of the persistence, climatological, and
autoregressive models across the various horizons. First consider the comparative performance of the
persistence and climatological forecasts. When h=1, the climatological forecasts are much worse than the
persistence forecasts, reflecting the fact that persistence in daily average temperature renders the
persistence forecast quite accurate at very short horizons. As the horizon lengthens, however, this result is
reversed: the persistence forecast becomes comparatively poor, as the temperature today has rather little to
with the temperature, for example, nine days from now.
Second, consider the performance of the autoregressive forecasts relative to the persistence and
climatological forecasts. Even when h=1, the autoregressive forecasts consistently outperform the
persistence forecast, and their relative superiority increases with horizon. The autoregressive forecasts also
outperform the climatological forecasts at short horizons, but their comparative superiority decreases with
horizon. The performance of the autoregressive forecast is commensurate with that of the climatological
-11-

forecast roughly by the time h=4, indicating that the cyclical dynamics captured by the autoregressive
model, which are responsible for its superior performance at shorter horizons, are not very persistent and
therefore not readily exploited for superior forecast performance at longer horizons.
Now let us compare the forecasting performance of the autoregressive model and the EarthSat
model. When h=1, the EarthSat forecasts are much better than the autoregressive forecasts (which in turn
are better then either the persistence or climatological forecasts). Figures 11 and 12 make clear, however,
that the EarthSat forecasts outperform the autoregressive forecasts by progressively less as the horizon
lengthens, with nearly identical performance obtaining by the time h=8. One could even make a case that
the point forecasting performances of EarthSat and our three-component model become indistinguishable
before h=8 (say, by h=5) if one were to account for the sampling error in the estimated RMSPEs and for the
fact that the EarthSat information set for any day t actually contains a few hours of the next day.
All told, we view the point forecasting results as encouraging. At short horizons, time-series
models produce forecasts at least as accurate, and often much more accurate, than those of standard
benchmark persistence and climatological competitors, if nevertheless less accurate than state-of-the-art
meteorological forecasts. At the longer horizons of relevance for weather derivatives, time-series models
produce forecasts at least as accurate as those of competitors. One might assert, of course, that doing no
worse than competitors at long horizons is faint praise, as all point forecasts revert fairly quickly to the
climatological forecast, and hence all long-horizon forecasts are simply “equally poor.” But such an
assertion misses a crucial point: modern time-series methods can capture movements in conditional
moments beyond the conditional mean, such as the conditional variance dynamics emphasized earlier,
which feed into the density forecasts of ultimate relevance for weather derivatives, whose performance we
now assess.
Density Forecasting
In this section, we shift our focus to long-horizon density forecasting, and to cumulative heating
-12-

degree days, all of which is of crucial relevance for weather derivatives. Heating degree days for day t is
simply

. We use our model of daily average temperature to produce density

forecasts of cumulative HDDs from November 1 through March 31, for each city and for each year
between 1960 and 2000, defined as

for y = 1960, ..., 2000, i = 1, ..., 4. We

remove February 29 from each leap year, so that each year is exactly 365 days long; hence each sum
contains exactly 151 days. We use full-sample as opposed to recursive parameter estimates, as required by
the very small number of CumHDD observations. To avoid unnecessarily burdensome notation, we will
often drop the y and i subscripts when the meaning is clear from context.
We focus on CumHDD for two important reasons. First, weather derivative contracts are often
written on the cumulative sum of a weather related outcome over a fixed horizon, as with the cumulative
HDD and CDD contracts traded on the CME. Second, and related, the November-March HDD contract is
one of the most actively traded weather-related contracts and hence is of substantial direct interest.
On October 31 of each year, and for each city, we use the estimated daily model to produce a
density forecast of CumHDD for the following winter’s heating season. We simulate 250 realizations of
CumHDD, which we then use to estimate the density, as follows. First, we simulate 250 151-day
realizations of the temperature shock

, by drawing with replacement from the empirical distribution of

estimated temperature shocks ( ). Second, we run the 250 151-day realizations of temperature shocks
through the estimated model (1) to obtain 250 simulated 151-day realizations of daily average temperature.
Third, we convert the 250 simulated 151-day realizations of daily average temperature into 250 simulated
151-day realizations of HDD, which we cumulate over the November-March heating season,
,
, based upon

Finally, we form the empirical distribution function of
, s = 1, ..., 250.

After passing through the entire sample, we have 41 assessed distribution functions,
one governing each of

We assess the conditional
-13-

calibration of those distributional forecasts via the probability integral transform, as suggested and
extended by Rosenblatt (1952) and extended by Dawid (1984), Diebold, Gunther and Tay (1998), and
Diebold, Hahn and Tay (1999). In particular, if the estimated distribution and true distribution coincide
year-by-year, then the series of assessed distribution functions
of realized values of
Formally,

evaluated at the corresponding series

should be approximately iid and uniformly distributed on the unit interval.
For each city, we check uniformity by examining histograms

of z, and we check independence by examining correlograms of the first four powers of z. The sample of
size 41 is of course small, but the framework has previously been applied successfully in small samples, as
for example by Diebold, Tay and Wallis (1999).
First consider assessing uniformity. We estimate the density of z using simple four-bin histograms,
which we present in the leftmost column of Figure 13, accompanied by 95% pointwise error bands under
the iid U(0, 1) null hypothesis. Interestingly, the z series differ rather noticeably from uniformity, and
moreover, they display a common pattern: too many large CumHDD realizations occur relative to the
assessed distributions, as evidenced by the increase in the histograms when moving from left to right. The
common nature of uniformity violations may indicate a neglected common temperature component, due for
example to El Niño, La Niña, changes in the jet stream, or various other global factors.
Now consider assessing independence. In the last four columns of Figure 13, we show the
correlograms of the first four powers of z, taken to a maximum displacement of ten years, together with
asymptotic 95% Bartlett bands under the iid null hypothesis. The results are mixed, but a common pattern
of some positive serial correlation is often apparent.
All told, although our CumHDD distributional forecasting performance is encouraging in certain
respects, there is nevertheless clear room for improvement. Evidently the effects of small specification
errors in the daily model, which have negligible consequences for near-term forecasting, cumulate as the
horizon lengthens, producing large consequences for longer-term forecasting. This makes perfect sense
-14-

when one considers that the error in forecasting CumHDD is of course the sum of the many component
daily errors, and that the variance of a sum is the sum of the variances plus the sum of all possible pairwise
covariances. Hence tiny and hard-to-detect but slowly-decaying serial correlation in 1-day-ahead daily
average temperature forecasting errors may cumulate over long horizons.
In future work beyond the scope of the present paper, it will be of interest to model and forecast
CumHDD directly. Presently we fit only a single (daily) average temperature model, which we estimate by
minimizing a loss function corresponding to 1-day-ahead mean squared prediction error, and we then use
the model to produce forecasts at many different horizons, all of which feed into our CumHDD forecasts.
4. Concluding Remarks and Directions for Future Research
Weather modeling and forecasting are crucial to both the demand and supply sides of the weather
derivatives market. On the demand side, to assess the potential for hedging against weather surprises and
to formulate the appropriate hedging strategies, one needs to determine how much “weather noise” exists
for weather derivatives to eliminate, and that requires weather modeling and forecasting. On the supply
side, standard approaches to arbitrage-free pricing are irrelevant in weather derivative contexts, and so the
only way to price options reliably is again by modeling and forecasting the underlying weather variable.
Rather curiously, it seems that little thought has been given to the crucial question of how best to approach
weather modeling and forecasting in the context of weather derivative demand and supply. The vast
majority of extant weather forecasting literature has a structural “atmospheric science” feel, and although
such an approach may well be best for forecasting twelve hours ahead, as verified both by our own results
and those of numerous others, it is not obvious that it is best for the longer horizons relevant for weather
derivatives, such as twelve weeks or six months. Moreover, it is distributional forecasts, not point
forecasts, that are of maximal relevance in the derivatives context. Good distributional forecasting does not
necessarily require a structural model, but it does require accurate approximations to stochastic dynamics.
In this paper we took an arguably-naive nonstructural time-series approach to modeling and
-15-

forecasting daily average temperature in four U.S. cities, and we inquired systematically as to whether it
proves useful. The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is a qualified yes. Time-series modeling reveals a wealth
of information about both conditional mean dynamics and conditional variance dynamics of daily average
temperature, and it provides insights into both the distributions of temperature and temperature surprises,
and the differences between them. The success of time-series modeling in capturing conditional mean
dynamics translates into successful point forecasting. Our point forecasts dominated the persistence and
climatological forecasts, but were still not as good as the judgementally-adjusted NWP forecast produced
by EarthSat until a horizon of eight days, after which all point forecasts perform equally well.
We routinely found strong seasonality in weather surprise volatility, and we assessed the adequacy
of long-horizon distributional forecasts that accounted for it, with mixed but encouraging results.
Interestingly, we found noticeable commonality in the patterns of cross-city deviations from perfect
conditional calibration, indicating possible dependence on common latent components, perhaps due to El
Niño or La Niña.
All told, we would assert that in the context of weather modeling as relevant for weather
derivatives, it appears that the performance of simple yet sophisticated time-series models and forecasts is
at least good enough to suggest the desirability of additional exploration. When, in addition, one considers
that time-series models and methods are inexpensive, easily replicated, easily extended, beneficially
intrinsically stochastic, and capable of producing both point and density forecasts at a variety of horizons,
we feel that a strong case exists for their use in the context of modeling and forecasting as relevant for
weather derivatives.
We would also assert that our views are consistent with the mainstream consensus in atmospheric
science. In his well-known text, for example, Wilks (1995, p. 159) notes that “[Statistical weather
forecasting] methods are still viable and useful at very short lead times (hours in advance) or very long lead
times (weeks or more in advance) for which NWP information is either not available with sufficient
-16-

promptness or accuracy, respectively.” Indeed, in many respects our results are simply an extensive
confirmation of Wilks’ assertion in the context of weather derivatives, which are of great current interest.
Ultimately, our view on weather forecasting for weather derivatives has evolved toward
recognition that climatological forecasts are what we need, but that standard point climatological forecasts
– effectively little more than daily averages – are much too restrictive. Instead, we seek “generalized
climatological forecasts” from richer models tracking entire conditional distributions, and time-series
methods may have much to contribute. Our model quantifying the time-varying conditional variance of
daily average temperature is one step toward a fully generalized climatological forecast, but many issues
remain unexplored. Here we briefly discuss a few that we find particularly intriguing.
Arguably our central modeling innovation centers on the dynamics of the conditional variance.
But richer dynamics could also be beneficially permitted in both lower-ordered conditional moments (the
conditional mean) and higher-ordered conditional moments (such as the conditional skewness and
kurtosis). As regards the conditional mean, one could introduce explanatory variables, as in Visser and
Molenaar (1995), who condition on a volcanic activity index, sunspot numbers, and a southern oscillation
index. Relevant work also includes Jones (1996) and Pozo et al. (1998), but all of those papers use annual
data and therefore miss the seasonal patterns in both conditional mean and conditional variance dynamics
so crucial for weather derivatives demand and supply. One could also allow for stochastic regime
switching, which might aid, for example, in the detection of El Niño and La Niña events. (See Richman
and Montroy, 1996, and also Zwiers and von Storch, 1990.) Note that allowance for stochastic regime
switching is very different from structural break detection, caused, for example, by a change in
measurement location, measurement equipment, observation time. As regards the conditional skewness
and kurtosis, one could model them directly, as for example with the autoregressive conditional skewness
model of Harvey and Siddique (1999). Alternatively, one could directly model the evolution of the entire
conditional density, as in Hansen (1994).
-17-

Aspects of multivariate analysis and cross-hedging also hold promise for future work. Cross-city
correlations may be crucially important, because they govern the potential for cross-hedging. Hedging
weather risk in a remote Midwestern location might, for example, be prohibitively expensive or even
impossible due to illiquid or nonexistent markets, but if that risk is highly correlated with Chicago’s
weather risk, for which a liquid market exists, effective hedging may still be possible. An obvious and
important extension of the univariate temperature analysis reported in the present paper is vector
autoregressive modeling of daily average temperature in a set of cities, allowing for a time-varying
innovation variance-covariance matrix. Of particular interest would be the fitted and forecasted conditional
mean, variance and covariance dynamics, the covariance matrices of standardized innovations, and the
impulse response functions (which chart the speed and pattern with which weather surprises in one location
are transmitted to other locations).
Another interesting multivariate issue involves weather-related swings in earnings and share prices.
One might conjecture that once Wall Street recognizes that there are effective ways to manage weather risk,
weather-related swings in earnings will no longer be tolerated. It will be of interest to use the size of
weather-related swings in earnings as way to assess the potential for weather derivatives use. In particular,
we need to understand how weather surprises translate into earnings surprises, which then translate into
stock return movements. Some interesting subtleties may arise. As one example, note that only systematic
weather risk should be priced, which raises the issue of how to disentangle systematic and non-systematic
weather risks. As a second example, note that there may be nonlinearities in the relationship between
prices and the weather induced via path dependence; if there is a freeze early-on, for example, then it
doesn’t matter how good the weather is subsequently: the crop will be ruined and prices will be high (see
Richardson, Bodoukh, Sjen, and Whitelaw, 2001).

Notes to Tables and Figures
Notes to Table 1: We show each forecast’s root mean squared error, measured in degrees Fahrenheit.
Notes to Figure 1: Each panel displays a time-series plot of daily average temperature, 1996-2001.
Notes to Figure 2: Each panel displays a kernel density estimate of the unconditional distribution of daily
average temperature, 1960-2001. In each case, we employ the Epanechnikov kernel and select the
bandwidth using Silverman’s rule,

.

Notes to Figure 3: We show the seasonal patterns estimated from Fourier models,
, where we approximate daily average temperature
dynamics by the unobserved-components model,

, as

discussed in detail in the text.
Notes to Figure 4: Each panel displays the residuals from an unobserved-components model,
, as discussed in detail in the text, 1996-2001.
Notes to Figure 5: Each panel displays a kernel density estimate of the distribution of the residuals from
our daily average temperature model,

, as discussed in detail in

the text. In each case, we employ the Epanechnikov kernel and select the bandwidth using Silverman’s
rule,

.

Notes to Figure 6: Each panel displays sample autocorrelations of the residuals from our daily average
temperature model,

, together with Bartlett’s approximate

ninety-five percent confidence intervals under the null hypothesis of white noise, as discussed in detail in
the text.
Notes to Figure 7: Each panel displays sample autocorrelations of the squared residuals from our daily
average temperature model,

, together with Bartlett’s

approximate ninety-five percent confidence intervals under the null hypothesis of white noise, as
discussed in detail in the text.

Notes to Figure 8: Each panel displays a time series of estimated conditional standard deviations (

) of

daily average temperature obtained from the model, where
, 1996-2001.
Notes to Figure 9: Each panel displays a kernel density estimate of standardized residuals from our
average temperature model,

. In each case, we employ the

Epanechnikov kernel and select the bandwidth using Silverman’s rule,

.

Notes to Figure 10: Each panel displays sample autocorrelations of the squared standardized residuals
from our daily average temperature model,

, together

with Bartlett’s approximate ninety-five percent confidence intervals under the null hypothesis of white
noise, as discussed in detail in the text.
Notes to Figure 11: Each panel displays the ratio of a forecast’s RMSPE to that of a persistence forecast,
for 1-day-ahead through 11-day-ahead horizons. The solid line refers to the EarthSat forecast, and the
dashed line refers to the autoregressive forecast. The forecast evaluation period is 10/11/99 - 10/22/01, as
discussed in detail in the text.
Notes to Figure 12: Each panel displays the ratio of a forecast’s RMSPE to that of a climatological
forecast, for 1-day-ahead through 11-day-ahead horizons. The solid line refers to the EarthSat forecast,
and the dashed line refers to the autoregressive forecast. The forecast evaluation period is 10/11/99 10/22/01, as discussed in detail in the text.
Notes to Figure 13: Each row displays a histogram for z, as well as correlograms for the first four powers
of z, where z is the probability integral transform of cumulative November-March HDDs, 1960-2000.
Dashed lines indicate approximate ninety-five percent confidence intervals in the iid U(0,1) case
corresponding to correct conditional calibration. See text for details.
