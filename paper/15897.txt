The two sectors had positively correlated marginal products until the 2000s, when the residential marginal
product fell during the housing boom, and rose during the housing bust. By the end of 2009, the residential
MPK was back to the level of the 1990s. The Great Recession and recovery sawthe non-residential MPK
fall from historically high values to historically low ones, and then increase much of the way back.

Introduction
Economic theory suggests that marginal product of capital series might help

predict economic growth forward one or two years, even under abnormal conditions such
as wartime or depression. In some situations, the marginal product of capital is an
essential ingredient in cost-benefit analyses (Harberger 1968; Byatt, et al., 2006;
Mityakov and Ruehl, 2009). Evidence on the marginal product of capital can also help
test various explanations for business cycles, help identify causes and consequences of
the recent housing “bubble,” and help quantify the economic burdens of business taxes.
The purpose of this paper is to produce annual and quarterly estimates of the marginal
product of capital (net of depreciation), one each for the residential and nonresidential
sectors of the U.S. economy.
By definition, the marginal product of capital net of depreciation is the change in
net domestic product (NDP) during the accounting period (e.g., one quarter) that would
result from an increase in the beginning-of-period capital stock of $1 worth of capital,
holding constant the total supply of all other factors. The additional $1 of capital is
assumed to have the same composition as the rest of the capital stock. For example, if
the economy’s capital consisted of 400 identical structures and 100 identical vehicles,
each of which cost $2 to acquire, then the marginal product of capital would be the extra
NDP attained by starting the quarter with 400.4 identical structures and 100.1 identical
vehicles (that is, $0.80 worth of structures and $0.20 worth of vehicles).
Suppose that origins of the current recession could be traced back to limits on the
supply of aggregate investment due to a “credit crunch.” (Real investment did fall
through the first year and a half of this recession.) The credit crunch theory says that the
marginal product of capital would rise over this period as a consequence of the increased
cost of capital faced by those with new capital projects. Alternatively, a financial crisis
or something else could reduce labor usage more directly, and, given the

1

complementarity of labor and non-residential capital in production, a fall in nonresidential investment would merely result from low marginal products of capital, thereby
putting the non-residential capital stock on a path that is consistent with a lesser amount
of labor usage (Mulligan, 2010).
The marginal product of capital is also interesting as an aggregate leading
indicator of business conditions, which is the motivation for its use in a number of studies
(e.g., Feldstein and Summers (1977), Auerbach (1983)). This relationship alone may
make it a predictor of subsequent economic growth.
Additionally, Fisherian consumption-saving theory suggests that the marginal
product of capital, or variations of it, should predict consumption growth. In a Robinson
Crusoe economy, the consumer would save for the future by reducing current
consumption and using the proceeds to build capital assets. She would then use the
marginal product and capital gains from those assets to add to consumption in the future.
Because the saving decision is made in the present while the principal and interest are
spent in an uncertain future, the incentive to save depends on, among other things, the
expected marginal product and expected capital gains. The current marginal product
itself helps predict the incentive to save only to the extent that it is closely related to the
expected sum of future marginal product and capital gains. For this reason, we present
measures of the marginal product that might be more indicative of those expected gains,
and (consistent with national accounting practices: see Fraumeni, 1997) measures of
depreciation that reflect expected depreciation and obsolescence, rather than actual
depreciation and obsolescence.
It is helpful to examine the marginal product of residential capital separately from
the marginal product of non-residential capital for at least two reasons. For one, the
aggregate demand for labor is expected to have a closer relationship with the stock of
non-residential capital than the stock of houses, because workers use non-residential
capital in doing their jobs. Additionally, some important capital market distortions –
such as business taxes and the “housing bubble” – are expected to have opposite effects
on the stocks of residential and non-residential capital, and thereby opposite effects on
their marginal products.

Section II presents our methods for calculating annual marginal products, and
discusses the findings for 1930-2009. The marginal product of capital is very different in
the residential and non-residential sectors, both in terms of levels and fluctuations.
Section III examines the importance of taxes in explaining the gap between marginal
products in the two sectors. The methods and results for quarterly postwar marginal
products through 2009-IV are presented in Section IV. In order to isolate some of the
possible determinants of measured marginal products, Section V compares them with
average products. Section VI concludes, and Appendices record the time series values
discussed in the body of the paper.

II.

Aggregate Annual Marginal Products
In a competitive capital market with constant returns to scale, the marginal

product of capital is simply the income accruing to domestically employed capital
divided by the amount of capital employed at the beginning of the accounting period,
valued at replacement cost. Computing this measure entails a couple of minor hurdles.
First, the location of capital income may not match the location of capital. For example,
national income is the income of citizens, while the capital stock, measured as
accumulated domestic investment, comprises the capital located on home soil, regardless
of the nationality of its owners. We account for this by focusing on domestic measures of
both the income and stock of capital, or estimating them when necessary.
Second, national accounts do not disaggregate non-corporate business incomes
into labor and capital income. We account for this by assuming that the capital income
share for non-corporate business is the same as for corporate business. Third, neither
government capital income nor government nonresidential capital is recorded in the
national accounts. Thus, our non-residential estimates consider private sector stocks and
flows only.
A final hurdle arises because capital income is a flow, the price level of which
changes throughout the accounting period. To account for this in our calculation of

3

annual real capital income, we discount time t flows back to the t-1 price level using the
annual PCE deflator.
The period t net-of-depreciation marginal product of residential capital MPHt is
calculated using three entries from the NIPAs (the PCE deflator, nominal net housing
value added2, and nominal compensation of employees in housing) and one entry from
the fixed asset tables (current-cost stock of residential structures):

MPH t =

(net housing value added)t − (compensation of HH sector employees)t Pt −1
(residential structures, current cost)t −1
Pt

(net housing value added)t ≡ (PCE housing services)t − (housing intermediates)t
−(residential structures depreciation)t
Pt ≡ (PCE deflator)t
where net housing value added is PCE housing services minus housing intermediates and
depreciation.3
The period t net-of-depreciation marginal product of private nonresidential capital
is calculated using one entry from the fixed asset tables and ten entries from the NIPAs:

2

Net housing value added is not available for the most recent year. We estimate it by taking the average of
the quarterly values that we estimate for the quarterly series—see Section III.
3
Following Feldstein, Dicks-Mireaux, and Poterba (1983), our concept of the marginal product of capital is
gross of all taxes (although, in practice, they did not attempt to add back any portion of state and local taxes
or business transfer payments, other than property taxes): the concept is the effect of a unit of capital on
national income or output, even the part accruing to tax authorities. Since we have calculated net marginal
product of residential (non-residential) capital by making subtractions from output (national income), rather
than additions to capital income, we do not have to add business transfer payments or state and local taxes
“back in.”

α is capital’s share of factor income, so α times private national domestic income (NDI –
Egov) is private domestic capital’s income.4 The term in square brackets is the income
accruing to domestically and privately employed nonresidential capital.
Figure 1 displays both the residential and nonresidential net-of-depreciation
marginal products of capital (MPKs), calculated as outlined above. From the late 1950s
through the late 1970s, the two series display strong positive correlation, with a smaller
degree of correlation during the 1980s and 1990s. However, starting in 2001, the series
display strong negative correlation.
The non-residential MPK has many ups and downs. In contrast, prior to the most
recent cycle, the postwar residential MPK series seems to have only five phases in 70
years: a downward trend in the 1930s and 1940s, an up trend 1948-64, a downtrend 196480, an up trend 1980-92, and a flat period during the 1990s.

4

Proprietor’s income and Tout (Tout is essentially indirect taxes and business fees paid to government) are
assumed to be divided among capital and labor in the same proportions as the rest of private domestic
income. Property taxes are assigned to pre-tax capital income, and allocated to the proprietor’s sector in
proportion to the rest of private domestic national income.

5

As shown in more detail in Figure 2, the residential MPK shows a steep decline,5
while the nonresidential MPK rises, during the period of buildup in housing generally
associated with the housing “bubble” (2001-2006). Then, after the housing cycle peak,
both series change direction, with the nonresidential MPK falling in 2007 for the first
time since 2001 and the residential MPK halting its steep four-year decline. These
changes coincide with a sharp fall in construction of new housing and a corresponding
pickup in investment in nonresidential structures (Mulligan and Threinen, 2008).

III.

Tax Policy and Distortions between Residential and Nonresidential
Capital
The axes’ scales in Figure 1 show a dramatic difference between the measured

marginal products of residential and nonresidential capital in a typical year. On average
from 1970-2000, the marginal product of residential capital was only 5.8 percent per
year, whereas the marginal product of non-residential capital was more than double –
about 13.9 percent per year.
Mismeasurement could cause the two measured marginal products to be different,
although the direction of the measurement bias is ambiguous. For example, intangible
capital (Griliches, 1981) is excluded from our capital stock measures and may be
differentially important in the non-residential sector. On the other hand, land values are
also excluded from our capital stock measures, and residential capital may be especially
land intensive.

5

The fall in marginal product of residential capital in 2005 is partly explained by Hurricanes Katrina and
Rita, the effects of which should ideally be excluded from estimates of expected marginal product. For this
reason, values for the quarterly series below will be interpolated for the year 2005.

6

Indirect taxes (such as sales and excise taxes) and income taxes are expected to
cause the gross-of-tax marginal product of non-residential capital to significantly exceed
the marginal product of residential capital, because investors are presumed to require
similar after-tax returns from their investments in the two sectors.6 In order to calculate
the magnitude of these effects, we calculate an average after-tax return for non-residential
capital by adjusting for indirect and income taxes that do not apply to housing, and
compare the tax-adjusted MPK to MPH.
New homes owe essentially zero sales and excise taxes, and the imputed services
to owner-occupied housing are not subject to sales, excise, or income tax. Landlords
typically do not owe sales or excise tax on the rents they receive, as long as the rental
period is more than a few months. Indirect taxes are paid by non-residential businesses,
so we subtract capital’s share of those taxes from gross-of-tax non-residential capital
income,7 and make no subtraction from residential output. Figure 3’s solid and dashed
blue series shows the gap between MPK and MPK gross of taxes (that is, as shown in
Figures 1 and 2) and adjusted for indirect taxes, respectively. On average from 19702000, the indirect-tax-adjusted gap is 6.9 percent per year, as compared to 8.1 percent per
year for the gross-of-tax gap.

6

Property taxes are levied on both residential and non-residential property, and national accounts data
show that owner-occupied housing’s share of property taxes paid is similar to its share of the total capital
stock (residential and non-residential).
7
If capital could be freely moved between the residential and non-residential sectors to equalize after tax
returns, then sales taxes on non-residential output would create a wedge between MPH and MPK equal to
the product of the sales tax rate and capital’s share of income in the non-residential sector. We measure
“indirect taxes” as the difference between “taxes on production and imports less subsidies plus business
current transfer payments” and property taxes, so our measure includes excise taxes, customs taxes,
business license fees, and some even smaller items.

7

We consider three alternative adjustments for federal and state individual and
corporate income taxes. Two of them assume a marginal income tax rate (35 and 50
percent, respectively), and calculate marginal non-residential capital income taxes as the
product of that rate and the MPK adjusted for indirect taxes.8 The assumed rate is
intended to represent the combination of corporate taxes and the individual income taxes
owed by business owners on their business income. A larger assumed rate is appropriate
to the extent that capital is owned by taxable corporations and/or the business owners are
in relatively high personal income tax brackets.
Figure 3 shows two of the income tax adjustments, and how the combined
adjustment leaves a gap that is closer to zero than to the gross-of-tax gap. On average
from 1970-2000, the gaps using the 35 and 50 percent marginal income tax rates are 2.7
and 0.7 percent per year,9 respectively. Given that the gross-of-tax gap was 8.1 percent
per year, it seems that most of that gap can be explained by the collection of various taxes
on non-residential business activity that are not collected in the residential sector.10

IV.

Quarterly Marginal Products
Parts of the gross-of-tax calculations described above can be duplicated directly to

produce quarterly series. However, because the BEA estimates capital stocks and certain
other series only on an annual basis, quarterly measurement of the marginal products of
capital require estimates of the quarterly evolution of those series.

8

Some housing output is taxed by the personal income tax because some of the housing (less than a
quarter) is owner by businesses, so in principle the MPH should be income tax adjusted too. However, the
adjustment may be small because businesses own so little of the housing and because business may use
rental housing to shelter other income from taxes.
9
A third alterative assumes that the combined corporate and individual income tax burden is the same in
the corporate and noncorporate non-residential sectors, and that each dollar of corporate income tax
collected on corporate income is associated with a dollar of individual income tax collected on distributions
to corporate equity and debt holders, thereby subtracting twice the ratio of corporate income tax revenue to
corporate capital from the sales-tax adjusted MPK. The result is gap of -0.4 percent per year.
10
Feldstein, Dicks-Mireaux, and Poterba (1983) calculated a marginal product of capital that was gross of
property taxes but net of all indirect taxes and business transfer payments (not just labor’s share of them).
Their tax treatment amounts to what we have considered the MPK “net of indirect tax” (see the dashed blue
series in our Figure 3). They also included measured capital to include the value of land, which would
further reduce the measured MPK by about 20 percent.

III.A. Residential Capital
Our first step in producing the quarterly residential marginal product of capital
series (gross of tax) was to estimate the evolution of the net real residential capital stock
by quarter. This was done by allocating the annual change in the real net stock in a given
year across quarters in the same proportions as real gross residential investment during
the same year. The second step was to inflate this real series to create a scaled nominal
series, which was done using the residential investment price index. Finally, the annual
change in the current cost residential capital stock was allocated across the quarters of a
given year in the same proportions as changes in the scaled nominal series (produced in
step two) over the quarters of that year.
Furthermore, the annual series lack published values for the most recent year. In
order to estimate the real capital stock for the most recent year, it was assumed that a
given gross real residential investment in a quarter affected the real net capital stock in
the same way during the most recent year as it was estimated to have done in the last
published year. That is, for the most recent year,
RealResCapStockt = RealResCapStockt-1 + (GrRealResInvt/GrRealResInvt-4) *
(GrRealResInvt-4/TotalResInv) * (ΔRealResCapStock)
where RealResCapStockt is the real residential capital stock in quarter t, GrRealResInvt is
the gross real residential investment in quarter t, TotalResInv is the total real gross
residential investment during the most recent published year, and ΔRealResCapStock is
the change in the net real residential capital stock between the two most recently
published years.
This real series was then inflated using the residential investment price index.
Finally, the scaled nominal series was converted to the final estimate by assuming that
changes in the scaled series and corresponding changes in the final series occurred in the
same proportion during the last published year and the most recent year.
Similar issues affected estimation of the income series. The net housing value
added series, which was used in the calculation of annual residential capital income, also

9

appears only on an annual basis. Quarterly housing value added was estimated by
allocating the annual net housing value added, less compensation of employees, across
the four quarters of a given year in the same proportions as nominal personal
consumption expenditures on housing during that year. For quarters of the final year of
the series, it was assumed that year-over-year residential capital income increased at the
same rate as year-over-year nominal personal consumption expenditures on housing.
That is, for the most recent year,
ResCapInct = ResCapInct-4*(PCEHousingt/PCEHousingt-4)
where ResCapInct is the estimated residential capital income in quarter t and
PCEHousingt is nominal personal consumption expenditures on housing in quarter t.
Finally, net capital income in 2005 (in particular, depreciation) was strongly
affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, so estimates produced by the above method
would not be a suitable measure of expected capital income for that year. As a result, the
marginal products of capital for the four quarters of 2005 are linearly interpolated
between 2004:Q4 and 2006:Q1.

III.B. Nonresidential Capital
The quarterly series for the nonresidential marginal product of capital was
constructed using the same basic formula as the annual series given above.

The

numerator of that formula can be applied directly because each of the needed series is
available on a quarterly basis. As a result, only the quarterly evolution the nonresidential
capital stock series required any modification from the original formula.
This estimation of the quarterly evolution of the net nonresidential capital stock
was done in a manner analogous to the approach outlined above for the quarterly
residential series. The annual change in the real net stock in a given year was allocated
across quarters in the same proportions as real gross nonresidential investment during the
same year. Next, this real series was inflated to create a scaled nominal series, which was
done using the nonresidential investment price index. Finally, the annual change in the
current cost nonresidential capital stock was allocated across the quarters of a given year

10

in the same proportions as changes in the scaled nominal series over the quarters of that
year.
As was the case with the residential data, the annual series lack published values
for the most recent year. In order to estimate the real capital stock for the most recent
year, it was assumed that a given gross real nonresidential investment in a quarter
affected the real net capital stock in the same way during the most recent year as it was
estimated to have done in the last published year. Finally, the scaled nominal series was
converted to the final estimate by assuming that changes in the scaled series and
corresponding changes in the final series occurred in the same proportion during the last
published year and the most recent year. This is exactly the approach taken with the
residential data.
Finally, as with the residential data, capital income in 2005 was strongly affected
by extraordinary depreciation associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, so the
marginal products of capital for the four quarters of 2005 are linearly interpolated
between 2004:Q4 and 2006:Q1.

III.C. Results
Figure 4 displays both the residential and nonresidential net-of-depreciation
marginal products of capital on a quarterly basis, calculated as outlined above, since
1947-I. In order to make some of the details more visible, Figure 5 shows the same series
for the quarters 1990-I through 2009-IV. As expected, the same general trends that were
evident in the annual series appear here. Figure 4 suggests that, with the exception of the
most recent cycle, the residential MPK does not change as significantly over the business
cycle as does the non-residential MPK, but has more significant decade-to-decade
changes.11
The main facts of note in the quarterly series are, first, that the trends in both
series since 2001 have been basically smooth across quarters, with a steady decline in the
residential MPK followed by an increase starting in 2006 and the reverse trend in
nonresidential MPK. Second, the increase in the residential MPK and the coincident

11

The relative cyclicality of the two series may be due to a greater complementarity of labor with businesssector capital, as opposed to housing.

11

decrease in the nonresidential MPK continued through 2009, although the non-residential
MPK has reversed its trend in the two most recently available quarters (2009-III and -IV).
The most recent residential MPK is also at least as high as its historical average, and near
the highs of the 1990s, which suggests that residential investment may have hit its lows.

V.

Quarterly Average Products
A sector’s marginal product of capital is that sector’s capital income per dollar of

capital, which can be decomposed into the product of the sector’s capital share of income
times the sector’s income per dollar of capital. That is, the marginal product of capital is
the product of capital’s share and the average product of capital.
The average product of capital would be a better indicator of the marginal product
of capital when measured capital share fluctuates mainly due to measurement error rather
than genuine changes in the returns to labor and capital. For example, at high frequencies
there may be lags in the recording of capital or labor income, as with severance payments
that are made to a worker after he stops contributing to production. At low frequencies,
labor unions may rise or fall, and labor unions may exercise their power by having some
of the returns to capital reallocated toward themselves (Leontief, 1946). These are some
of the reasons to examine measures of average products in addition to marginal products.
With the quarterly marginal product series already estimated, it is straightforward
to compute the net average products of capital (APKs) in the two sectors. For the
residential sector, the quarterly net value of housing services (including labor) was
estimated using a formula analogous to the one used to estimate the quarterly net value
added of housing services from residential capital. The net residential APK is then
calculated by dividing this series by the already estimated quarterly residential capital
stock.
For the nonresidential sector, we have
APKt = (PNDIt – ResVAt) / (private nonresidential fixed asset stock, current cost)t

12

where APKt is the period t net average product of nonresidential capital, PNDIt is the
period t private net domestic income, and ResVAt is the net residential value added
(which was produced for the estimation of residential APK as outlined above).
Figure 6 displays both the residential and nonresidential net-of-depreciation
average products of capital on a quarterly basis, calculated as outlined above. These
series have a stronger correlation than the marginal series during the period from 19602000.

However, they show the same divergence from 2001-2005 and partial

reconvergence since 2006 that the MPK series suggests should have occurred.
Additionally, as with the MPK series, the nonresidential APK is presently within its
average range, while the residential APK remains below its average from the past two
decades.

VI.

Conclusions
The marginal product of non-residential capital, net of depreciation, is more than

double the marginal product of residential capital. Most of the marginal productivity gap
between the two sectors can be explained by the fact that so much residential output
escapes income and indirect business taxation.
Over the last ten years, the marginal and average products of residential capital
fell, and then increased, as housing construction was booming and busting. In this sense,
the residential data suggest that the supply of residential capital shifted along a relatively
stable demand for the services of that capital. As indicated by the marginal product of
residential capital at the end of 2009, current housing supply seems restricted by
comparison with the housing boom (when the residential MPK was low), but fairly
normal by comparison with the 1990s when the residential MPK was similar to what is
was at the end of 2009.12 These patterns are consistent with the findings of Davis,
Lehnert, and Martin (2008) and others that housing rent-price ratios were low during the

12

Conversely, a marginal product of residential capital that significantly exceeded the levels of the 1990s
would indicate housing supply conditions that are more restrictive than they were in the 1990s.

13

housing boom, and with the conclusions that the housing boom was fueled by optimistic
expectations, or by easy credit.
The marginal product of non-residential capital was much higher during the
housing boom than it was during the recession, when rates of investment in nonresidential equipment and software were low. In this sense, the supply of non-residential
capital seems less restricted during the recession than it was before. In other words, the
recession’s investment rates may have been low because of a slack labor market, rather
than the other way around (Mulligan, 2010). In any case, the testing of various theories
of this recession, and the prior housing cycle, can be enhanced with marginal products
data like those shown in this paper.
