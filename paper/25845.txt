Consumer Myopia in Vehicle Purchases: Evidence from a Natural Experiment
Kenneth Gillingham, Sébastien Houde, and Arthur van Benthem
NBER Working Paper No. 25845
May 2019
JEL No. D12,L62,Q4
ABSTRACT
A central question in the analysis of fuel-economy policy is whether consumers are myopic with
regards to future fuel costs. We provide the first evidence on consumer valuation of fuel economy
from a natural experiment. We examine the short-run equilibrium effects of an exogenous
restatement of fuel-economy ratings that affected 1.6 million vehicles. Using the implied changes
in willingness-to-pay, we find that consumers act myopically: consumers are indifferent between
$1 in discounted fuel costs and 15-38 cents in the vehicle purchase price when discounting at 4%.
This myopia persists under a wide range of assumptions.

Introduction

The transportation sector is now the largest contributor of carbon dioxide emissions in
the United States and emissions from petroleum constituted 45% of all energy-related
carbon dioxide emissions in 2017.1 Fuel-economy regulations are the dominant policy to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector in the United States and
many other countries, despite economists long arguing for a Pigouvian gasoline tax to
internalize climate change (and other) externalities (Parry and Small 2005).
Fuel-economy standards require automakers to meet average fuel-economy targets
for new light-duty vehicles. A common argument for such standards is that they “save
consumers money” due to buyers undervaluing fuel economy at the time of the vehicle
purchase (Parry, Walls, and Harrington 2007). This argument suggests that consumers are
buying lower fuel economy vehicles, with higher fuel costs, than is ex post privately optimal for them. Such myopia is a common explanation for what has become known as the
“energy efficiency gap,” whereby consumers do not adopt seemingly high-return energyefficiency investments (Hausman 1979; Gillingham, Newell, and Palmer 2009; Allcott and
Greenstone 2012).2 Indeed, there is a large and growing behavioral economics literature
documenting cases where consumers appear inattentive or otherwise seem to misoptimize in many settings, such as health plans (Abaluck and Gruber 2011, 2016), sales taxes
(Chetty, Looney, and Kroft 2009), and heuristics for large-number processing (Lacetera,
Pope, and Sydnor 2012).3
This paper presents the first evidence on the consumer valuation of fuel economy

We follow the terminology in the existing literature (e.g., Hausman 1979; Busse, Knittel, and
Zettelmeyer 2013) and use “myopia” to describe a range of behavioral phenomena that could cause undervaluation.
3
Studies have examined how consumers and market performance respond to information disclosure
in various contexts, including financial decisions (Duflo and Saez 2003; Bertrand and Morse 2011; Goda,
Manchester, and Sojourner 2014), takeup of social programs (Bhargava and Manoli 2015), sexually risky
behavior (Dupas 2011), vehicle choice (Tadelis and Zettelmeyer 2015), electricity consumption (Jessoe and
Rapson 2014), and educational investment (Jensen 2010). In this paper, we test how consumers respond to
information disclosure about fuel-economy ratings.

from a natural experiment providing exogenous variation in the fuel-economy rating
that new vehicle buyers observe. In 2012, after an audit by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the two major automakers Hyundai and Kia acknowledged that
they had overstated the fuel economy for 13 important vehicle models from the 20112013 model-years by one to six miles-per-gallon. This overstatement—by far the largest
in history—affected over 1.6 million vehicles sold, including several popular models such
as the Hyundai Elantra and Kia Rio. Hyundai and Kia blamed a “procedural error” in
the mileage testing and had to abruptly change the official fuel-economy ratings for these
vehicles. Following the restatement, the automakers agreed to compensate buyers who
had already purchased vehicles with misstated ratings, while new car buyers after the
restatement did not receive compensation.4 The restatement was unexpected—even just
prior to it, Hyundai and Kia often advertised the high fuel economy of their vehicles as a
major selling feature.
We first examine the equilibrium price response by consumers and firms to this large
unexpected restatement.5 Using detailed microdata on all new vehicle transactions in
the United States over the period August 2011 - June 2014, we find a 1.2% decline in the
equilibrium prices of the affected models (just under $300). We then proceed by directly
estimating the consumer valuation of fuel economy. Using our preferred set of valuation
assumptions, our results indicate that consumers are indifferent between one dollar in
future gasoline costs and 15-38 cents in the vehicle purchase price (a ‘valuation parameter’
of 0.15-0.38) depending on the affected model-year, and using a discount rate of 4%. We
thus find that consumers systematically undervalue fuel economy in vehicle purchases to
a larger degree than reported by much of the recent literature. This conclusion is robust
to a wide range of valuation assumptions, including vehicle supply elasticities, as we
illustrate in a bounding exercise.
Previous studies estimating the consumer valuation of fuel economy use several

In focusing on the equilibrium effects of the restatement, our study relates to the literature estimating
the equilibrium effects of boycotts on firms or products (e.g., Chavis and Leslie 2009; Hendel, Lach, and
Spiegel 2017).

different identification strategies, but most leverage changes in gasoline prices to test
whether vehicle prices fully adjust with the changes in the expected discounted present
value of future fuel costs. This basic approach was used as early as the 1980s, with Kahn
(1986) finding that used car prices adjust only one third to one half the amount that would
be expected based on the changes induced by shocks to gasoline costs and argues that
used car buyers must be myopic.
More recent studies have documented a wide range of valuation parameter estimates.
Allcott and Wozny (2014) exploit variation in gasoline prices and estimate a valuation
parameter of 0.72 for used vehicle purchasers in the United States. This result suggests
more limited undervaluation of fuel economy. Allcott and Wozny also present a wide
range around their preferred estimate (from 0.42 to 1.01) due to different assumptions
going into the calculation of the discounted present value of future fuel savings. Several other recent studies present estimates centered around one, implying that consumers
fully value future fuel savings. Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013) also rely on gasoline price variation and use both new and used vehicle data, while Sallee, West, and Fan
(2016) estimate their model with used vehicle auction data and use variation in odometer readings. Grigolon, Reynaert, and Verboven (2018) use temporal variation in gasoline
prices combined with cross-sectional variation in engine technology to find a central-case
valuation parameter of 0.91 in Europe. Taken together, these studies suggest modest undervaluation at most.6 In contrast, Leard, Linn, and Zhou (2018) use data from new vehicles in the United States and exploit the timing of adoption of fuel-saving technologies.
They find a substantially lower valuation parameter of 0.54. Leard, Linn, and Springel
(2019) focus on using cross-sectional variation in engine technologies and find even lower
values; most of their estimates are below 0.30.
We bring a new identification strategy to shed light on this unsettled question. An appealing feature of using our natural experiment to understand consumer myopia is that
we can rely on a sudden and exogenous shifter of the official fuel-economy rating, yet be

Some earlier studies that do not explicitly estimate a valuation parameter similarly suggest full valuation of fuel economy (Goldberg 1998; Verboven 2002).

assured that the vehicles themselves are identical before and after the change. The rating is the primary source of information provided by the government to help consumers
compare fuel economy across different vehicles, and thus it serves as a policy-relevant
exogenous shifter of expected future fuel costs. This rating is likely highly salient to consumers when shopping for cars, as it features prominently on dealer lots and all major
automotive websites.
If consumers appear to act myopically and undervalue fuel economy in new vehicle
purchases, this implies that it is possible for a policy that shifts consumers into more
efficient vehicles to be welfare-improving, even if environmental externalities are fully
internalized. Our analysis uses a novel approach to provide guidance to policymakers on
this critical parameter for understanding the costs and benefits of fuel-economy standards
and their performance relative to a tax on gasoline.

The 2012 Fuel-Economy Rating Restatement

The restatement was made public on November 2, 2012, when EPA stated in a press release that “in processing test data, Hyundai and Kia allegedly chose favorable results
rather than average results from a large number of tests.”7 This was a result of a 2012
EPA audit of the model-year 2012 Hyundai Elantra, which revealed a large discrepancy
between the test results and the self-reported fuel economy provided by Hyundai. Based
on this finding, EPA expanded its investigation to other Hyundai and Kia vehicles, uncovering many more discrepancies, all of which overstated fuel economy. The two automakers claimed that “honest mistakes” had been made, such as a “data processing
error related to the coastdown testing method.”8
Immediately after the EPA press release, the fuel-economy ratings for all affected vehi7

cles were updated on all new car comparison websites, at www.fueleconomy.gov, and
on the EPA fuel-economy labels on all new vehicles on dealers’ lots.9 Hyundai and Kia
were also required to update all advertising that mentioned the incorrect fuel-economy
ratings. At the time of the restatement, over 900,000 vehicles with incorrect fuel-economy
labels had already been sold, which amounts to roughly 35% of all 2011-2013 models sold
through October 2012 by the two automakers. Appendix A provides a list of the restated
models and the change in miles-per-gallon for each.
Prior to the restatement, Hyundai and Kia often mentioned the high fuel economy of
their vehicles as a selling point.10 This added to the unexpected and abrupt nature of the
restatement. Following the restatement, the automakers offered compensation to buyers
that had already purchased vehicles with misstated fuel economies (see Appendix A for
details). New vehicles offered after the restatement—the focus of our analysis—were not
subject to the compensation.

Data

Our first dataset contains all dealer-reported new vehicle transactions in the United States
from August 2011 to June 2014 from R.L. Polk. These data include the vehicle identification number (VIN) prefix (often known as the “VIN10” because it includes the first 10
digits that provide information about vehicle characteristics), the transaction date, the
transaction price, and the Nielsen Designated Market Area (DMA), which is a commonly
used geographic delineation for media markets. There are 210 DMAs in the United States
and each is a cluster of similar counties that are covered by a specific group of television
stations. The transaction price is inclusive of all dealer and manufacturer incentives. The
data do not allow us to observe movement on other dealer’s margins, such as preferen9

Appendix A shows an example label.
Consider this quote from a November 2, 2012 article (https://www.autoblog.com/2012/11/02/

true.”

tial financing. The VIN10 uniquely identifies the vehicle trim, engine size, and further
characteristics.
Table 1 presents means of key variables for the affected models, non-affected models
by Hyundai and Kia, and all other models in market segments with at least one affected
vehicle. Panel A presents total sales and average transaction prices. For Hyundai, sales
of affected models were about half of total sales, while for Kia, they comprised about
a third. Hyundai and Kia have similar pricing, with the affected models being priced
slightly below the non-affected models. Both automakers specialize in smaller cars that
are priced below the average for other automakers.
Panel B shows the composition of each of the fleets and some characteristics. 71% of
the affected Hyundai vehicles are small cars, while 80% of the affected Kia vehicles are
crossovers. We thus have identifying variation across different classes of vehicles. Both
automakers have unaffected small cars and crossovers, providing variation within classes
as well. On average, we see that the affected models tend to have slightly lower weight
and cost slightly less than non-affected models or models from other automakers.
For our calculations of the valuation of fuel economy, we also bring in data on monthly
nationwide gasoline prices from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and on average vehicle-miles-traveled from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). We
provide estimates using the 2006 NHTS, following Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013),
as well as the recent 2017 NHTS.

The Equilibrium Effects of the Restatement
Effects on Transaction Prices

We begin our empirical analysis by examining the equilibrium effects of the restatement
on new vehicle transaction prices. Our empirical approach is a difference-in-differences

estimator:
P ricejrt =β1(P ost Restatement)t × 1(Affected Model )j + ρt×Classj + µt×M akej
+ ηr × 1(P ost Restatement)t + ηr + ωj + jrt .

(1)

where P rice is either the log or level of the transaction price for a VIN10 j sold in region r (DMA) in year-month t. 1(P ost Restatement)t is an indicator variable for after
the restatement in November 2012 and 1(Affected Model )j is an indicator variable for an
affected model. We next include year-month indicators interacted with vehicle class indicators (ρt×Classj ) to allow for flexible time controls specific to each vehicle class. We
further add year-month indicators interacted with make indicators (µt×M akej ) for flexible
time controls for each automaker. We include DMA indicators (ηr ) and their interaction
with the post-restatement indicator (ηr × 1(P ost Restatement)t ). Finally, ωj are VIN10
fixed effects. We weight the regressions by monthly sales.
Our coefficient of interest, β, is identified using the temporal variation before versus after the restatement across the affected and non-affected vehicles within automakers
and within vehicle classes. We restrict the sample to only include vehicle classes in which
Hyundai and Kia have affected cars: subcompact, compact, midsize, fullsize, sport, compact crossover, and midsize crossover. Our fixed effects specification exploits the panel
nature of our data along with its high level of disaggregation to address a variety of potential time-invariant and time-varying confounders.11
We expect our coefficient of interest β to be negative if the market responds in equilibrium to the downward adjustment of fuel economy for the affected models. Panel A
of Table 2 presents our primary results. Columns 1-3 estimate the model using the log of
the transaction price as the dependent variable. Columns 4-6 use the level of the price.
Columns 3 and 6 are our preferred specifications. The coefficients become slightly larger
11

In this respect, our identification follows recent studies. For example, Allcott and Wozny (2014) and
Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013) use temporal variation in gasoline prices after conditioning on year
or model-year fixed effects. Grigolon, Reynaert, and Verboven (2018) use a country-specific quadratic time
trend rather than year fixed effects. Sallee, West, and Fan (2016) exploit variation in odometer readings
within a model-year while controlling for VIN10-year-month.

7

as we add fixed effects (especially in levels), but are generally quite similar across specifications.
Our results indicate that the restatement led to a 1.2% decrease in equilibrium transaction prices, which amounts to a $294 decline on average across all affected models.
Figure 1 presents the average treatment effects by month. To create this figure, we interacted 1(P ost Restatement)t × 1(Affected Model )j with each year-month in our sample and
plotted the coefficients over time. We see no discernable evidence of a treatment effect
prior to the restatement, but afterwards we observe a decrease in transaction prices (that
hovers around 1%) for the affected models until January 2014. After this there are only
few treated vehicles left and the treatment effect reverts back towards zero. By the end
of our sample, the 2014 model-year vehicles would have been selling for almost a year
(note no 2014 model-year vehicles are affected) and very few 2013 model-years are left on
dealers’ lots.
4.1.1

Robustness Checks

A critical assumption underlying any difference-in-differences analysis is the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), which requires that the treatment assignment does not affect the potential outcomes of the non-treated observations (noninterference).12 SUTVA can be violated if there are spillovers between the treated and
control (e.g., from strategic pricing in a market with differentiated products) or if there
are broader general equilibrium effects due to the treatment.
We perform several robustness checks to confirm that SUTVA holds in our case. Panel
B in Table 2 presents our first SUTVA robustness checks by showing the results after excluding close substitute vehicles, which are the most likely to be affected by strategic pricing. If excluding close substitutes does not affect our estimates, then we can be confident
that SUTVA holds.
12

The classic SUTVA assumptions also require stability in the treatment. In our context, the fuel-economy
rating changes by different amounts, and thus our primary results should be interpreted as an average
effect.

8

Columns 1 and 4 exclude the Hyundai and Kia vehicles that are the closest substitutes
to the restated models, but were not subject to a restatement. Close substitute vehicles
are defined as those offered by the same automaker in the same R.L. Polk vehicle class.
Columns 2 and 5 provide an alternative test that excludes the five most popular close
substitutes from other automakers, where we define substitutes across automakers using
data from Edmunds.com and MotorTrend.com.13 Columns 3 and 6 exclude the Hyundai
and Kia substitutes as well as the substitutes from other automakers. Removing close
substitutes makes little difference to the estimated coefficients in Panel A. The coefficients
excluding substitutes are all within the 95% confidence interval of our primary specification, indicating that the slight change in the competitive landscape from the restatement
had little influence on the pricing of substitute models.14
We expect that the restatement for Hyundai and Kia had negligible general equilibrium effects on the much larger vehicle market. However, one might be concerned that
the widely-publicized restatement had an effect on the overall Hyundai and Kia brands,
so that equilibrium prices change due to a diminished perception of the brands rather
than a change in the fuel-economy ratings. Note however that our primary specification
uses variation across affected and non-affected models within automakers, so any change
in brand equity affects both the control and treatment groups. In fact, when we estimate
the model removing all other automakers besides Hyundai and Kia, we find very similar results. This result, along with further robustness checks on sample selection, can be
found in Appendix Tables B.3 and B.4.
4.1.2

Heterogeneous Effects on Transaction Prices

The restatement might be expected to influence the equilibrium pricing decisions of automakers differently based on the model-year of the vehicle and the magnitude of the
13

Edmunds.com provides a list of other models that consumers considered for each model and modelyear. MotorTrend.com explicitly provides a list of the closest competitors. We combined the two lists and
then chose the five highest-selling vehicles from the combined list.

In Appendix Tables B.1 and B.2, we use alternative vehicle class fixed effects and find the results are
robust. These checks can be seen as changing the control group and the trends that the affected models are
compared to.

change in the fuel-economy rating. In Table 3, we explore heterogeneous treatment effects with respect to these variables.15 Columns 1 and 2 replicate our preferred specification from Table 2. Columns 3 and 4 allow the treatment effect to vary by model-year.
We see that the coefficients are generally similar, but the equilibrium price decline for the
2011-2012 model-years (1.7%) is somewhat greater than for the 2013 model-year (1.1%).
In levels, the price reductions are $544 and $259, respectively. This difference could be
due to differences in supply elasticities (see Section 4.2 for details) or automakers facing
customers with different demand elasticities for the newest model-year vehicles.
Columns 5 and 6 allow the treatment effect to vary along with the change in the
gallons-per-mile implied by the restatement. We use gallons-per-mile rather than milesper-gallon because we anticipate consumers care about total expected fuel costs and fuel
costs scale linearly with gallons-per-mile.16 The negative coefficient indicates that the
price reductions are larger for models that faced a greater reduction in fuel economy
(i.e., increase in fuel intensity). When evaluated at the mean change in gallons-per-mile
(0.0019), the effects are smaller than in our preferred specification in columns 3 and 6 of
Table 2 (-0.006 and -$132 in logs and levels). This suggests that consumers do not respond
to the magnitude of the restatement perfectly proportionately.

4.2

Effects on Other Outcomes?

In equilibrium, it is possible for there to be other adjustments as well. Busse, Knittel, and
Zettelmeyer (2013) show that when gasoline prices change, sales of new vehicles tend to
be affected even more than transaction prices. However, our setting is quite different. By
November 2012, automakers had already ended production of model-year 2011 and 2012
vehicles and all remaining vehicles from those model-years were already on dealer lots.
Model-year 2013 vehicles were still midway through their production cycle. Adjustments
in production for these vehicle models are possible, but costly. Such adjustments would
have required reallocating assembly lines or renegotiating contracts with suppliers, which
15
16

Appendix Tables B.5 and B.6 explore heterogeneity by make and vehicle class.
The results have nearly identical implications if we use miles-per-gallon.

10

may not be worth it for a one-time restatement. In fact, maintaining market share might
well be the optimal long-run managerial strategy in response to a one-time negative shock
(see Appendix C.1 for details). Therefore, supply was likely very inelastic for model-year
2011 and 2012 vehicles but possibly somewhat more elastic for model-year 2013 vehicles.
In Appendix C.1, we examine the equilibrium effects of the restatement on quantities
using a specification similar to equation (1). Automobile sales tend to be highly idiosyncratic, however, with much difficult-to-explain variation occurring month to month. As
a result, we obtain very noisy estimates: all coefficients are positive but imprecisely estimated. While we can only take this noisy evidence as suggestive, we certainly do not find
clear evidence for a negative equilibrium quantity effect. We discuss the implications of
positive or negative quantity effects for our eventual estimate of the fuel-economy valuation parameter in Section 5 and Appendix D.2, and find our conclusion about undervaluation to be robust.
Another possible adjustment could be to increase advertising expenditures. We examine this in Appendix C.2 and find no evidence of changes in either advertising expenditures or the number of advertisements after the restatement.

5.1

Implications for the Valuation of Fuel Economy
Valuing Fuel Economy

To understand how consumers value fuel economy, we are interested in how the discounted present value of future fuel costs influences vehicle purchase decisions. Going
back to Hausman (1979), economists have examined how consumers trade off one dollar
in upfront purchase costs against one dollar in the discounted present value of future energy costs. If consumers respond more to a change in upfront cost relative to future costs,
this is taken as evidence of undervaluation of energy efficiency, or what is often described
as myopia. It has become common to operationalize the valuation of energy efficiency
through a valuation parameter, defined as the consumer response to the net present value
11

of future fuel costs over the response to the purchase price (e.g., Allcott and Wozny 2014;
Sallee, West, and Fan 2016; Grigolon, Reynaert, and Verboven 2018; Leard, Linn, and
Zhou 2018).17
Our approach to estimating undervaluation is inspired by Allcott and Wozny (2014).
They start from a discrete choice model of vehicle choice with i.i.d extreme value idiosyncratic preferences, and invert the equation to arrive at a specification that regresses the
vehicle purchase price on discounted lifetime fuel operating costs and controls. Our valuation specification is:
P ricejrt = γ∆Gjt + ρt×Classj + µt×M akej + ηr × 1(P ost Restatement)t + ηr + ωj + jrt . (2)
where P ricejrt is the vehicle transaction price and ∆Gjt is the change in the discounted
lifetime fuel cost due to the restatement.18 In Appendix D.1, we motivate equation (2)
from a random utility model and show that γ can be interpreted as the valuation parameter if sales do not adjust, which appears to be the case in our natural experiment
(see Section 4.2). We thus interpret a value of -1 as full valuation—where an increase in
expected future fuel costs is entirely reflected by a decrease in the purchase price—but
discuss the implications of elastic supply in Appendix D.2.
There are two major empirical challenges to interpreting an estimate of γ in equation
(2) as a causal estimate of undervaluation. First, ∆Gjt must be constructed based on assumptions about future driving, vehicle survival probabilities, expected future gasoline
prices, and the car owner’s discount rate. We follow the existing literature in using an exhaustive set of assumptions to better understand the plausible range of γ. Second, ∆Gjt is
17
Much of the early literature on energy efficiency valuation estimates an implicit discount rate that rationalizes full valuation, subject to assumptions about many other factors that could influence the valuation of
fuel economy. We follow recent papers in presenting a valuation parameter subject to an assumed discount
rate (and the same set of assumptions about other factors). This is mostly an expositional choice.
18
Note ∆Gjt = 0 for all non-affected models in this specification, so the variation in ∆Gjt is coming both
from the differences between affected and non-affected models, as well as from the change in fuel economy
due to the restatement. The only other source of variation in ∆Gjt could be from changing gasoline prices.
Gasoline prices are similar before and after the restatement, but as a robustness check we replace the gasoline price with an average price over the entire period (shutting down this additional source of time series
variation) and find similar results (Appendix Table D.2).

12

potentially endogenous due to a correlation between market shares (in jrt ) and expected
future fuel costs, as well as potentially subject to measurement error (see Appendix D.1
for details). Our natural experiment overcomes these challenges because it provides a
source of exogenous variation in ∆Gjt , and the restatement is perfectly observed.
We first estimate equation (2) using a baseline set of assumptions in constructing ∆Gjt :
expected driving based on the 2017 NHTS, vehicle survival probabilities from Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013), and expected gasoline prices being held constant in real terms
at the levels at time t (a martingale assumption, following evidence from Anderson, Kellogg, and Sallee (2015)). Panel A of Table 4 presents the results under these baseline
assumptions. We show results for different discount rates, starting with a 1% rate in
columns 1 and 2, and ending with a 12% rate in columns 7 and 8. For each discount rate,
the first column presents the results using the pooled sample, while the second presents
the results exploring heterogeneity in valuation across model-years.19
The results show that the equilibrium price changes induced by the restatement correspond to substantial undervaluation of fuel economy: the loss in the expected net present
value of future fuel costs implied by the restatement far exceeds the equilibrium price
changes, with the gap even larger for the affected 2013 model-years. The result in column
1 (1% discount rate) implies that consumers are indifferent between $1 in expected future
fuel costs and $0.14 in the upfront purchase price (i.e., a valuation parameter of 0.14). The
results in column 2 indicate substantial heterogeneity, with consumers buying the 20112012 model-years (35.4% of the affected vehicles) having a valuation parameter of 0.32,
while for the 2013 model-year it is 0.13. Moving to a discount rate of 12%, the pooled
sample shows a parameter of 0.25, where the 2011-2012 model-years have a valuation parameter of 0.56 and the 2013 model-year has a parameter of 0.22. It is difficult to arrive
at a preferred specification when there are so many assumptions that could vary the parameter; we prefer a middle ground 4% discount rate (see Panel B of Table 4). This gives
a valuation parameter of 0.15 for model-year 2013 and 0.38 for model-years 2011-2012.
19

For the pooled sample, an implicit discount rate of approximately 80% would be required to bring the
valuation parameter to one.

13

We cannot emphasize enough that with different sets of assumptions, the undervaluation parameter would change. For a wide enough range of assumptions, the valuation
parameter can be as low as zero or as high as one. However, at a 4% discount rate and
using reasonable sets of assumptions for constructing ∆Gjt that closely follow the existing literature, we find a range for the valuation parameter almost entirely below 0.5
(Appendix D.3). Moreover, in Appendix D.2 we allow for negative or positive quantity
effects and find that the valuation parameter stays below 0.5 even when quantity effects
are large (+/-5%; pooled sample). Our finding of substantial undervaluation is therefore
robust.

5.2

Comparison to Previous Literature

Panel B of Table 4 summarizes the range of our results along with several notable papers
in the literature. The valuation parameters in Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013),
Sallee, West, and Fan (2016), and Grigolon, Reynaert, and Verboven (2018) are all close
to one, which implies near-full valuation. While Allcott and Wozny (2014) and Leard,
Linn, and Zhou (2018) find parameters consistent with undervaluation, our estimates are
even lower. Our estimates, however, align with the heterogeneous estimates of Leard,
Linn, and Springel (2019), which range from 0.06 to 0.76 but are below 0.30 for most
demographic groups. There are several possible explanations for why our estimates are
lower than most others.
First, we use a different source of identification. Expected fuel expenditures are the
product of a consumer’s gas price expectations and her estimate of the car’s fuel economy.
Our experiment leverages a change in EPA miles-per-gallon ratings, which dealers are
required to feature on vehicles in their lots and which play prominently on new vehicle
comparison websites. Other studies leverage changes in gasoline prices and therefore
price expectations. Fully-informed rational consumers should respond equivalently to
changes in gasoline prices and fuel-economy ratings, but it is possible there is a difference,
e.g., if consumers are not perfectly-informed about fuel economy. This could imply our
14

results would better capture consumer behavior around regulations that directly affect
EPA ratings than previous work.
Another possible explanation is that we are focusing on new cars from Hyundai and
Kia, while other studies provide estimates from different markets. Sallee, West, and
Fan (2016) estimate their model on data from used car auctions. Busse, Knittel, and
Zettelmeyer (2013) use estimates based on both the new and used vehicle markets. But
our study is not the only one focusing on new cars (e.g., Grigolon, Reynaert, and Verboven 2018; Leard, Linn, and Zhou 2018). It is possible that buyers of new Hyundais
and Kias are different. On the one hand, it seems likely that Hyundai and Kia, which are
known for smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, draw a segment of new car buyers that are
more attentive to fuel economy, and thus would be expected to value fuel economy more
than average. On the other hand, these car buyers may also be lower-income households
who are more prone to steeply discount future fuel costs (Leard, Linn, and Springel 2019).
Our sample period also differs somewhat from previous work. Our results are from
2012 when the economy was still in a slow climb out from the Great Recession. Interest
rates were very low and gasoline prices were generally low. Fuel economy undervaluation may vary over time and economic conditions, but studying this issue in more detail
would require a long time series of restatement events.
Another possibility is that consumers already knew that the Hyundai and Kia models had lower fuel economy than was stated by the EPA ratings. Given how much of a
surprise the restatement was (as is evidenced by the media articles), we find this implausible. While one can find blog posts for automobile aficionados prior to the restatement
that indicated they were having a hard time achieving the EPA fuel economy, this is also
true for many other models that achieve lower on-road fuel economy than reported by
the EPA for many drivers. In general, the EPA-rated fuel economy is considered reliable
and is used in all car comparison articles, websites, and apps that we are aware of (Jacobsen et al. 2019). All things considered, it appears highly unlikely that consumers already
knew about the restatement in advance.

15

Another potential explanation for why our estimates differ is the approach used to
estimate the valuation parameter. Some papers, such as Sallee, West, and Fan (2016)
and Allcott and Wozny (2014) estimate the parameter directly, just as in our equation
(2). Others approximate the parameter by separately estimating the average change in
equilibrium prices and the average change in future fuel costs, and then dividing the first
by the second. In the closely-related context of appliances, Houde and Myers (2019) point
out that this approximation is likely to provide a biased estimate of the true valuation
parameter. The intuition is that the ratio of the means of two variables is usually not
the same as the mean of their ratio if these variables are heterogeneous and correlated.
Appendix D.4 illustrates the issue mathematically and provides a conceptual example.
Our results suggest that this approximation bias may be large in the context of fueleconomy valuation. In Panel B of Table 4, we divide up the recent studies based on the
approach taken, first showing studies estimating an exact valuation parameter and then
showing studies using the approximation. We also provide our own estimates based on
the same discount rates used in the previous studies, and present a range of valuation
parameters allowing for heterogeneity between affected model-years 2011-2012 versus
2013. For comparison purposes, we also calculate the approximated valuation parameter.
In our setting, we divide the estimated change in the equilibrium vehicle price in levels
(Table 2) by the sales-weighted change in discounted future fuel costs implied by the
restatement.
Our estimates show a wide range, but tend to be below 0.5 when the exact valuation
parameter is estimated, suggesting much more substantial undervaluation than previous
work. When we use the approximation, we find much greater valuation of fuel economy,
with upper bound estimates as high as one, as in several previous papers. In fact, our estimate with a 1.3% discount rate is in line with Leard, Linn, and Zhou (2018). Altogether,
these results suggest that some of the findings of nearly-full valuation of fuel economy in
the literature may suffer from upward bias due to this approximation.

Conclusions

This paper exploits an unexpected restatement in the EPA-rated fuel economy for thousands of vehicles. A highly desirable feature of this natural experiment is that the vehicles
themselves are identical before and after the restatement, providing us with a clean source
of variation in expected future fuel costs by consumers. This restatement reduces equilibrium prices by 1.2%, or just under $300. This variation allows us to estimate the valuation
of future fuel costs, through a valuation parameter that captures how consumers weigh
future fuel costs against the upfront purchase price. We find a wide range of valuation
parameters that depend on several assumptions about consumer expectations, discounting, supply elasticities, and other factors, but even the upper end of our range suggests
substantial undervaluation of fuel economy. For the 2011-2012 model-year vehicles, we
find that consumers are indifferent between a $1 increase in discounted future fuel costs
and a $0.38 increase in the upfront vehicle purchase price. The estimate drops to $0.15 for
the 2013 model-year vehicles.
This finding of substantial undervaluation differs from some–but not all–of the recent
literature, but it differs much less after accounting for whether the study estimates the exact valuation parameter or an approximation. Other factors may also make a difference,
including the empirical setting and the variation being exploited. We emphasize that
our results are the first in the literature to use a natural experiment that actually changes
EPA-rated fuel economy, and thus we believe that they provide valuable guidance to policymakers who are attempting to better understand the costs and benefits of fuel-economy
standards.

Notes: Dependent variable is the transaction price (in nominal dollars). Lifetime fuel costs are computed using annual
U.S. gasoline prices, survival probabilities from Jacobsen and van Benthem (2015), and VMT from NHTSA (2018). In
Panel A, the results are reported for different discount rates (r). A coefficient of -1 implies that a one-dollar increase in
lifetime fuel costs reduces the transaction price by one dollar. Values between -1 and 0 imply that consumers undervalue
future fuel costs. An observation is a year-month-DMA-VIN10. VIN10 refers to the VIN prefix, which is a trim-engine
combination. DMA refers to a Nielsen Designated Market Area, which is an area covering several counties. Class refers

accounts for heterogeneity between model-years 2011-2012 vs. 2013.

Fuel-Economy Label and Affected Vehicles

This appendix provides further details on the compensation offered to previous buyers,
provides a complete list of affected vehicles, and gives an example of a fuel-economy
label.
While there have been other fuel-economy restatements for a small number of vehicle
models before (e.g., Ford restated the fuel economy for six models in 2014, and similar
issues arose in 2019), the restatement by Hyundai and Kia was by far the largest in history
and the first example of a restatement that affected many models. To make amends after
this restatement, Hyundai and Kia provided owners of the affected vehicles purchased
prior to the restatement with a lifetime offer of reimbursement based on the difference
between the original and restated EPA fuel-economy rating (plus a 15% premium as an
apology).20 This compensation was announced only after the news about the restatement
became public. Buyers were compensated via prepaid debit cards given at dealerships
based on odometer readings and the fuel costs for the region in which they live. For
example, a 1 mile-per-gallon adjustment amounted to a refund of approximately $88 for
an owner who drove 15,000 miles.
Through a class-action lawsuit, with a settlement finally approved by the courts on
July 6, 2015, a second reimbursement option was added allowing affected customers to
receive a single cash lump-sum payment (so customers could avoid having to return to
the dealership frequently to have mileage verified).21 An appellate court put this settlement on hold in January 2018, ruling that a lower court had made errors in approving the
settlement. As a result, there is still a class-action lawsuit working its way through the

Note that both the initial compensation and any later payments resulting from classaction lawsuits only affected vehicles that had already been sold before the restatement
date, and did not affect new vehicle buyers afterwards. As such, the new car transaction
prices that we analyze do not involve or include compensation or settlement payments.
Next we move to the list of all of the Hyundai and Kia vehicles affected by the restatement. Table A.1 contains a complete list of all of the Hyundai affected vehicles, along
with selected vehicle characteristics. Table A.2 provides the same information for the Kia
affected vehicles. 80,000 of the vehicles sold had their combined (city and highway) rating
drop by 3-4 miles-per-gallon, while 240,000 dropped by 2 miles-per-gallon, and 580,000
dropped by 1 mile-per-gallon.23 Note that for some models, the change in the combined
miles-per-gallon rating is zero, even if the city or highway ratings changed. In Table B.4
below, we show a robustness check in which we run our primary specifications while excluding such minimally affected models to confirm that they are not affecting our results.
We now move to a discussion of the fuel-economy label. Fuel-economy labels on all
new vehicles indicate the combined city/highway fuel economy of the vehicle in large
block letters, include an estimate of the projected annual fuel cost from running that vehicle in large letters, include a dollar value savings (or spending) in fuel costs over the
next five years relative to the average new vehicle, and also provide the vehicle’s tailpipe
greenhouse gas rating and a smog rating.24 The EPA-rated fuel economy on the labels is
also presented on websites widely used by car buyers, such as www.fueleconomy.gov
and www.edmunds.com. In any comparison between vehicles, the EPA-rated fuel economy values will play prominently.
22

Hyundai and Kia also settled with the U.S. EPA and agreed to pay $100 million in civil penalties, the
largest such fines in EPA history up to that date, in addition to relinquishing emissions credits worth around
$200 million and offering previous buyers compensation. See https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/

24
The combined city/highway fuel-economy estimate is based on U.S. EPA test ratings. The annual fuel
cost estimates and fuel savings estimates are based on on-road fuel economy and an assumed 15,000 miles
driven annually.

In May 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration updated the label and it became widely used by nearly all automakers starting with model-year 2012. It was mandatory starting with model-year
2013. Figure A.1 provides an example of the post-2011 fuel-economy label required to
be posted on all new vehicles at the dealership. The fuel economy listed on the label
for each affected Hyundai or Kia vehicle was updated immediately at the beginning of
November in 2012.
The fuel-economy rating—featured prominently on all major automotive websites and
on the labels on dealer lots—is the primary source of information for potential car buyers to compare fuel economy across different vehicles. Fuel economy is likely a highly
salient vehicle specification during the car-buying process, as consumers explicitly consider tradeoffs between vehicle models and are repeatedly presented with the same information about fuel economy. Our experiment leverages a change in these miles-per-gallon
ratings, while other studies exploit changes in gasoline prices. Both fuel-economy ratings
and gasoline prices should inform the consumer’s estimate of future fuel savings. The
salience of the miles-per-gallon rating during the car-buying process adds to the appeal
of our setting; whether used car drivers know or remember the fuel economy of their
vehicles is an unsettled question.
There is a growing literature on the extent to which consumers pay attention to labels
about the energy efficiency of products. For example, Newell and Siikamaki (2014) find
that the EnergyGuide label for appliances that provides simple information on the monetary value of energy savings appears to come close to guiding cost-efficient decisions.
Davis and Metcalf (2015) show that more precise information from EnergyGuide labels
can lead to significantly better choices. Houde and Myers (2019) also show heterogeneity
in the response to energy information in appliance purchases. In one of the few papers on
fuel-economy labels, Alberini, Bareit, and Filippini (2016) find that discrete fuel-economy
grades (‘A’-‘G’) on mandatory labels for new vehicles in Switzerland influence equilibrium prices. This literature allows us to hypothesize that a large change in the listed fuel

31

economy on the labels will influence equilibrium outcomes in the new vehicle market.25
Moreover, in our context, it is not just the label that changed, but actually the EPA fueleconomy rating, which affects everywhere that fuel economy is mentioned.

Figure A.1: An Example of a Fuel-Economy Label

25

The fact that Allcott and Knittel (2019) show that interventions to provide information about fuel economy (in addition to the fuel-economy labels) have little effect on behavior casts some doubt on the effectiveness of informational interventions, but is still consistent with consumers basing their beliefs on the rated
fuel economy posted on the vehicle and found on websites and in manufacturer brochures.

Robustness Checks

This section provides a series of robustness checks on our primary results. We begin
by focusing on several different sets of fixed effects, which slightly change the variation
being used to identify our coefficients. Table B.1 provides the first set of robustness results
by including quarter-of-age by make fixed effects to capture the cyclicality in the vehicle
market that depends on the time since a vintage of a vehicle was introduced to the market.

Notes: Dependent variable is log or level of the transaction price (in dollars). Columns 1 and 4 are our primary
specification from Table 2. An observation is a year-month-DMA-VIN10. VIN10 refers to the VIN prefix, which is
a trim-engine combination. DMA refers to a Nielsen Designated Market Area, which is an area covering several
counties. Class refers to the vehicle class. Post Restatement refers to the year-month being during or after November
2012. Quarter-of-age refers to the number of quarters since the introduction of a new VIN10. All estimations are
weighted by monthly sales. Standard errors are clustered at the VIN10 level.

In Appendix Table B.2, we perform further robustness checks that include different
sets of fixed effects for month-of-sample interacted with vehicle class. Specifically, we
change the definition of a vehicle class to be a finer vehicle class definition than the
one used in our main specification, where we do not distinguish luxury and non-luxury
brands. In this robustness test, we use the exact segment definition proposed by R.L. Polk,
which distinguishes luxury and non-luxury brands (which we label “finer class fixed effects”). We also use a coarser set of class fixed effects, which combine compact, mid size
and full size crossover utility vehicles (into “crossover”); compact, mid size and full size
33

sport utility vehicles (into “SUV”); subcompacts and compacts (into “small cars”); and
mid size and full size (into “large cars”). These checks slightly change the variation being used, which amounts to effectively changing the composition of the control group
the affected models are compared to. We find that our results are highly robust to these
alternative specifications.

Notes: Dependent variable is log or level of the transaction price (in dollars). Columns 1 and 4 are our primary
specification. An observation is a year-month-DMA-VIN10. VIN10 refers to the VIN prefix, which is a trim-engine
combination. DMA refers to a Nielsen designated market area, which is an area covering several counties. Class
refers to the vehicle class. Post Restatement refers to the year-month being during or after November 2012. All
estimations are weighted by monthly sales. Standard errors are clustered at the VIN10 level.

We also perform a further set of robustness checks. First, we perform a series of checks
relating to decisions we made in creating our dataset. We see what happens if we do not
drop vehicles with transaction prices below $5,000 (3,203 additional vehicles are retained).
We view transaction prices less than $5,000 with suspicion, as they are likely miscoded.
We also examine the effect of excluding price outliers by only including vehicle transactions within a price ratio around the mean price for that model-trim over the whole
sample period between 0.67 and 1.5. Finally, we restrict the sample to include Hyundais
and Kias only, allowing us to focus only on variation between affected and non-affected
models for these two automakers. In Table B.3 we see some minor differences, but byand-large, we find that our results are robust across these specifications.
34

In our final set of robustness checks, we run all of the primary specifications but we
exclude affected models where the change in the rated fuel economy is minimal (defined
as only changes in city and/or highway ratings, but no change in the combined rating).
There were a fair number of these models, and one might be concerned that they skew
our results. Table B.4 excludes these minimally treated models from the sample. Again,
the results are remarkably similar.
One may also be interested in heterogeneity based on the automaker being affected.
Was Hyundai or Kia affected more? These are not robustness checks per se, but they
provide further insight to the heterogeneity of our results. Table B.5 examines the heterogeneous treatment effect on transaction prices by automaker. The point estimates suggest
a slightly larger effect for Hyundai than Kia, but the difference in the effect between the
two is not statistically significant.
In Table B.6, we examine heterogeneous effects on transaction prices by vehicle class.
We observe a larger effect for large cars than small cars. For vehicles in the crossover
and sport classes, the effect is not statistically significant. Our take-away from this is that
large cars and small cars are the dominant force behind the equilibrium price change,
which could correspond to consumers interested in these car classes being sensitive to
fuel-economy information.

Effect of Restatement on Other Outcomes

C.1

Effect on Quantities

As mentioned in Section 4.2, we might not expect to see much of an effect of the restatement on the sales of affected vehicles for several reasons. First, by November 2012,
Hyundai and Kia had completed production of all 2011 and 2012 model-year vehicles and
had moved on to producing model-year 2013 vehicles. Thus, it would be physically impossible for production of these model-year vehicles to adjust to the restatement. The only
quantity adjustment possible would be in dealers shifting sales to a later time, but there
are non-negligible inventory costs to holding older model-year vehicles on the dealer lot,
which makes this likely an unappealing option for dealers.
In November 2012, Hyundai and Kia were producing their 2013 model-year vehicles,
so it is certainly possible that they could adjust production due to the restatement. However, it is important to note that the restatement was a one-time negative shock for specific
model-year vehicles, rather than a longer-term change in demand, such as due to changes
in gasoline prices. Changing production requires costly physical adjustments to assembly lines and renegotiations of contracts with suppliers. Firms can make these changes
in response to major swings in gasoline prices (e.g., see Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer
2013), but it is unclear if they would make these costly changes in response to a one-time
negative shock. Furthermore, from a long-run profit maximization standpoint, maintaining market share (and thus minimal changes to production decisions) might well be the
optimal managerial strategy in response to such a one-time negative shock. For example,
it could allow firms to maintain market share that would be difficult to recapture later,
allowing for higher profits in the longer-run, even if short-run profits are reduced. Classic models in industrial organization with switching costs can rationalize such behavior.
For example, see discussion of the many possible pricing behaviors firms may display in
response to financial distress in Borenstein and Rose (1995).
Because it is possible that Hyundai and Kia adjusted production of affected models

39

at the same time that prices were adjusted, we also estimate several models exploring
the effect of the restatement on sales. Such estimations are likely to provide little useful
evidence, since automobile sales are very noisy. For example, model-trims have highly
variable temporal phase-in and phase-out patterns and there are niche model-trims that
are rarely sold.
Table C.1 confirms our intuition that automobile sales are very noisy. In this table,
we estimate a model aggregated at the VIN10-DMA-year-month level and regress the
sales of each model on 1(P ost Restatement)t × 1(Affected Model )j and the same set of
fixed effects that we include in the price regressions in Tables 2-4, which are year-month
by class fixed effects, year-month by make fixed effects, VIN10 fixed effects, DMA fixed
effects, and post restatement by DMA fixed effects. To address the possibility of niche
models that are rarely sold and model-years that are being phased in or phased out (and
thus showing large percentage changes in sales) unduly affecting our results, in columns
2 through 5 we present the results where we exclude observations if the monthly sales
are less than some percentage of average monthly sales for a particular model-trim. In
column 2, that percentage is 50% of monthly sales, in column 3 it is 40%, in column 4 it is
30%, and in column 5 it is 25%.
The coefficients in Table C.1 are all positive, suggesting that the restatement increased
sales, which is a counter-intuitive result. However, they are all imprecisely estimated. We
recognize that the lack of a statistically significant effect (either positive or negative) may
be due to a lack of power, although all estimations include over three million observations. Note that the highly variable phase-in and phase-out patterns make estimating an
effect on quantities especially challenging when there is not a strong signal in the data. In
our case, it appears that there is not a strong negative quantity effect of the restatement,
as one might have anticipated. In Appendix D.2, we discuss the implications of negative
or positive quantity effects on estimates of the valuation of fuel economy. We find our
conclusions about undervaluation to be robust to a wide range of quantity effects.

C.2

Effect on Advertising

In this subsection, we examine adjustments in advertising by the two affected automakers. For example, the automakers could have increased advertising expenditures to make
up for the bad publicity. To examine this, we use data from Kantar Media on advertising
expenditures by automaker. In the two figures below, we find no evidence of changes
in either advertising expenditures or the number of advertisements by Hyundai and Kia
after the restatement. We have also run simple regressions and find no statistically significant effects, with the point estimate quite close to zero. We thus conclude that the
quantity of advertising did not change after the restatement.
Of course, Hyundai and Kia are required by law to update any advertisement that
specifies the fuel economy of the vehicle, so the content of advertisements must change at
least somewhat. This is analogous to the change in advertising around fuel economy that
occurs during gasoline price shocks, underscoring that our estimated effect is an equilibrium effect in the same way that the rest of the literature is estimating an equilibrium

Further Details on the Valuation Calculations

D.1

Motivation from a Discrete Choice Model

This subsection motivates equation (2) from a discrete choice model. For this, we closely
follow Allcott and Wozny (2014). The starting point is a random utility model, where the
alternative-specific indirect utility of product j at time t, Ujt , is a linear function of income
(Y ), the purchase price (Pjt ), discounted fuel operating costs (Gjt ), other controls (Xjt ),
and unobservables (ξ˜jt ):
Ujt = δ(Y − Pjt − ηGjt ) + Xjt β + ξ˜jt .
With the assumption of an i.i.d Type I extreme value error ξjt ≡ ξ˜jt + δY , we have a
multinomial logit specification, implying that
eUjt
sjt = P U ,
kt
ke
where sjt is average probability of purchase of the representative consumer, or the market
share. Further, under this assumption of the errors, we have the standard identity:

log(sjt ) − log(s0t ) = −δPjt − θGjt + Xjt β + ξjt ,
where we define θ ≡ δη. Then in this framework, the definition of the valuation parameter
is the ratio θ/δ. This parameter quantifies the trade-off between how consumers value
an extra dollar spent on the upfront purchase price (through δ) and a dollar spent on
expected future fuel costs (through θ).
To directly estimate this valuation parameter, Allcott and Wozny (2014) invert the market share equation as follows:
Pjt = γGjt + Xjt β̃ + jt ,

44

(D.1)

where γ ≡ −θ/δ is the quantity of interest and the structural error term is jt = 1δ (log(s0t )−
log(sjt ) + ξjt ). Similarly, define β̃ ≡

1
β.
δ

Note that Xjt here contains various controls

required for identification, including a variety of fixed effects. In our context, we include
year-month by class fixed effects (ρt×Classj ), year-month by make fixed effects (µt×M akej ),
region fixed effects (ηr ) and their interaction with an indicator for the post restatement
period (ηr × 1(P ost Restatement)t ), and VIN10 fixed effects (ωj ). With these fixed effects
included, equation (D.1) is effectively the same as equation (2).
Interpreting the estimate of γ as an estimate of the valuation of fuel economy requires
that the structural error term is not correlated with the regressors. As defined above,
jt includes the market share at time t for product j. In our setting the identification
of γ thus requires that the contemporaneous market shares for each product j should
not be correlated with the change in discounted fuel costs induced by the restatement.
Our identification argument relies on the timing and one-time nature of the restatement:
it was an unexpected shock to the automakers that made it unlikely that they would
change product-line production decisions (indeed, for the 2011-2012 model-year vehicles,
production line decision changes would be impossible). Furthermore, we examined evidence for quantity adjustments by automakers, and find no support for such adjustments.
In comparison, Allcott and Wozny (2014)’s identification argument also relies on a timing
assumption, but exploits the fact that the used vehicle market, and in particular scrap
rates, should not vary in response to gasoline prices. This assumption is most likely to
hold for vehicles that are not too old.
Another key difference between our estimation and the empirical strategies that have
recently been used in this literature is that our estimating equation, unlike equation (D.1),
does not use the level of discounted fuel costs as a regressor (captured by the variable G),
but the difference in G induced by the restatement. Therefore, because the restatements
were known and salient, measurement error in the level of G is not a major concern in
our setting. This is in contrast to Sallee, West, and Fan (2016) and Allcott and Wozny
(2014), whose empirical strategy essentially requires constructing the average G that each

45

consumer faces, which will be a noisy estimate of its true value. Allcott and Wozny (2014)
address the issue using an instrumental variables strategy. Despite not explicitly including an estimate of G in their estimation, Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013)’s empirical
strategy is also prone to measurement error due to the fact that they must impute the average gasoline price that each consumer faces. They show that this issue is not important
in their setting by using different levels of aggregation in average gasoline prices.
Our natural experiment and approach allow us to circumvent the measurement error
issue to a certain extent by focusing on estimating the behavioral response to a change
in G induced by the restatement and publicized by the EPA, which is perfectly observed.
Note that the size of the change in G that each consumer faced is, of course, function of
the gasoline prices consumers paid, driving behavior, and other assumptions required to
construct G. We show, however, that our estimate of the valuation parameters are robust
to these assumptions (Table D.2).

D.2

Bounding Analysis

In Section 4.2 and Appendix C.1, we discuss why the supply of affected vehicle models
may be inelastic due to physical limitations and costly adjustments in the context of our
one-time restatement shock. In Table C.1, we also explore the effect of the restatement
on sales, but our estimates are too noisy to rule out either a positive or negative quantity
effect. In this appendix, we discuss how either a positive or a negative quantity effect
affects our estimates of the valuation parameter. The key insight from this discussion is
that our primary conclusions about substantial undervaluation hold for a wide range of
supply elasticities.
How the equilibrium price effect translates to an estimate of consumers’ willingnessto-pay for fuel economy depends on the relationship between demand and supply. Figure
D.1 presents three possible scenarios. In all three cases, the effect of the restatement is represented by a downward shift in the demand curve for the affected models—if consumers
value fuel economy, a downward adjustment of the miles-per-gallon rating reduces the
46

private consumer surplus that consumers would expect from such models. When the
supply is perfectly inelastic (Panel A), the downward shift in demand results in a change
in equilibrium prices that is exactly equal to the willingness-to-pay for fuel economy. In
our setting, we argue that this is a likely scenario. Given the unexpected nature of the restatement and the limited scope for production adjustments (especially for the 2011-2012
model-years), the supply curve for affected models should have been almost completely
inelastic, and thus the change in equilibrium price and willingness-to-pay should nearly
coincide.
When supply is elastic in the expected direction (Panel B), the change in equilibrium
price underestimates the change in willingness-to-pay. In the unlikely case that the supply curve is downward sloping (Panel C)—for instance, because of strong economies of
scale in the production process—the opposite holds: the change in equilibrium price overestimates the change in willingness-to-pay. Note that the point estimates in Table C.1
point to this case. In these two scenarios, the magnitude of the discrepancy between the
change in equilibrium price and the true willingness-to-pay for fuel economy depends on
the supply and demand elasticities.
To bound our estimates, consider the following scenario where we first consider
highly elastic supply that would result in a large quantity effect. Based on our quantity
regressions, we begin by assuming a reduction in quantity of 5%, which is approximately
the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval we report in Table C.1 (column 2). We
also have to assume a price elasticity of demand. Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995)
find own-price demand elasticities ranging to -6.5, while Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer
(2013) consider demand elasticities that range from -2 to -5, in part based on Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995)’s estimates. Hyundai and Kia are in the smaller car segment of
the market, so one might expect more elastic demand, which would suggest a number
closer to -6. Accordingly, we first calculate our estimates using a demand elasticity of -6,
but we also complete the analysis using a lower estimate of -4. We also need to assume
an average vehicle price pre-restatement, and for this we use $24,500 for our illustrative

47

calculation (this is calculated as $294/0.012 for consistency with our main results; it is
also reasonably closely aligned with the summary statistics on vehicle prices for Hyundai
and Kia). Note that when we use a smaller number for the pre-restatement price, such as
$20,000, the range of results narrows substantially, so our bounding analysis is conservative in this sense.
We can then make a set of simple calculations directly applying the demand elasticity
to give us the difference between the post-restatement price ($24,500 - $294) and what the
price would have been had the quantity not changed. Conceptually, we are just moving
along the demand curve by the percentage change in quantity.26 Using these assumptions and the $294 reduction in equilibrium price due to the restatement, we find the
willingness-to-pay for the 5% reduction in quantity is $496 when using a demand elasticity of -6 and $597 when using an elasticity of -4. This is roughly a doubling of the
estimated equilibrium price change.
In the unlikely case that economies of scale are such a dominant force that they induce
a downward sloping supply curve, the equilibrium change in price is an overestimate of
the willingness-to-pay. For example, suppose that we observe a positive quantity effect
of +5% (as our quantity estimation point estimates suggest). Then a $294 reduction in
equilibrium price corresponds to a willingness-to-pay of only $92 when using a demand
elasticity of -6 and is even below zero when using a demand elasticity of -4. Overall, these
illustrative bounds suggest that the valuation parameters that we estimate could be either
twice as large or close to zero for these particular scenarios.
Note that a quantity effect of +5% in this context is quite large relative to the $294 price
reduction, which is slightly over 1% of the transaction price. Under more reasonable scenarios for our setting where the quantity effects are in the +/-1% range, a $294 reduction
in equilibrium price translates in a willingness-to-pay of either $334 or $254 (under the -6
elasticity), respectively, which are much tighter bounds.
Table D.1 summarizes these results. Combined with Table 4, these results demonstrate
26

One can show that the total willingness-to-pay is given by ∆P + ∆P ×
elasticity of demand.

calculations are also based on an average pre-restatement price of $24,500.

that our main conclusions about substantial undervaluation hold up to a wide range of
supply elasticities, and hence, quantity effects. For instance, consider the pooled sample and a 12% discount rate. Further, suppose that the supply is highly elastic such
that it translates in a doubling of the valuation parameter, as it does in Table D.1 for the
willingness-to-pay estimate assuming a demand elasticity of -4 (for a demand elasticity
of -6 the valuation parameter would need to increase by 69%). Then the valuation parameter would be exactly 0.5, because our estimate is 0.25. For our preferred case of a 4%
discount rate, a doubling of the valuation parameter would correspond to 0.34. For the
valuation parameter for the 2011 and 2012 model-years, a doubling of the estimate would
yield a value of 0.76. Of course, for those models a highly elastic supply is very unlikely.27
Assuming a supply elasticity closer to zero, the effect on the valuation parameter should
be much more modest. In Table D.1, a quantity effect of -1% leads to an underestimate
of the willingness-to-pay by only 12% using ηD = −6 (this comes from (294-334)/334) or
17% using ηD = −4. Applying this magnitude of bias to the valuation parameter for the
model-years 2011 and 2012 would again imply valuation of fuel economy below 0.5.
27
As discussed earlier, the supply for model-year 2011 and 2012 should be inelastic given the impossibility of adjusting the production of a model-year that has finished its production cycle and high cost of
holding vehicles in inventory on the dealer lot.

D.3

Sensitivity Analysis of the Valuation Parameter

To estimate the valuation parameter, we need to construct the discounted future fuel costs
of each model in our sample. This requires making assumptions about how consumers
discount the future, drive their vehicles, forecast gasoline prices, and how long they expect their vehicles to last. We conduct fairly exhaustive sensitivity analysis for all these
parameters to investigate the robustness of our results.
Table D.2 outlines the various sensitivity tests we have conducted, data sources, and
comparisons with other studies. We find that the discount rate is the variable having
the most important effect on valuation. We consider different data sources for gasoline prices. We further consider different scenarios where expected gasoline prices are
being held constant in real terms at the levels at the time of registration. This martingale assumption implies that consumers use today’s price as a forecast of future prices
for the entire lifetime of their vehicle. We consider average price at the annual-national
level, annual-state level, month-national level, and at the month-national level without
seasonal trends. We also consider a scenario where we remove all variation in gasoline
prices and use the gasoline price for the year 2012, 2013, 2014, the average of 2012 and
2013, or the average of 2012, 2013 and 2014 as the constant gasoline price that consumers
use in their forecasting. Finally, we consider a scenario where consumers are able to make
a perfect forecast of future gasoline prices, where we use realized prices up to 2017 and
then the Energy Information Administration’s forecasted gasoline prices for the other future years. Compared to previous studies, our different scenarios about expectations of
gasoline prices broadly cover the range of assumptions that has been used. For instance,
Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013) and Sallee, West, and Fan (2016) both use the martingale assumption. Allcott and Wozny (2014) use the martingale assumption, but also
consider a scenario where consumers based their expectations on oil futures.
For vehicles’ survival probabilities, we estimate the results separately using the data
from Jacobsen and van Benthem (2015) and Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013), the
latter of which were derived from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). Data

51

for vehicle miles travelled come also from the NHTS. We compare results using the 2006
or the 2017 wave of the NHTS.

3.56 USD/gallon. In those two scenarios, there is no variation in discounted fuel costs induced by gasoline prices. The VMT estimates
are based on the NHTS survey. We use the data for the survey years 2006 or 2018. For the survival probabilities, we use the NHTS data
as reported by Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013). We also consider the estimates provided by Jacobsen and van Benthem (2015).
In the last row, we report the valuation parameters using the approximation that relies on the ratio of the mean change in prices over
the mean change in discounted fuel costs. This approximation has a large impact on the valuation parameter and leads to an upward
bias. The discount rate and whether we solely rely on the 2012 model-years are the two dimensions that induce the most variation in
the results. The data source for the VMT, survival probabilities, and the level of aggregation in the gasoline prices have little effects on
the results.

D.4

Bias from the “Ratio of the Means” Approximation

With the setup in Section D.1 above, it is even easier to understand the ratio of the means
issue referred to in the main text. Before moving to the equations, it is illustrative to begin with a simplified example to fix ideas. Suppose that two different vehicle models
were subject to a restatement in fuel economy: Model A, which has a price of $50,000,
and Model B, which has a price of $10,000. Also, suppose that both models are equally
popular, so we can ignore their relative market shares in this example. When the unexpected restatement occurs, this changes consumer expectations about the future fuel costs
of each of the two vehicles. Suppose the restated EPA fuel-economy ratings correspond to
52

a change in discounted lifetime fuel costs of $5,000 for Model A and $1,000 for Model B.
We are then interested in how the equilibrium prices and quantities change. Suppose that
sales are held constant. And further suppose that the restatement leads to heterogeneous
changes in equilibrium prices: $5,000 for Model A, but only $100 for Model B.
The valuation parameter implied by this illustrative event is $5,000/$5,000 = 1 for
Model A and $100/$1,000 = 0.1 for Model B. The mean of the valuation ratio is thus
the average of 1 and 0.1, which equals 0.55. This is the exact valuation parameter when
both models are equally popular. Now consider the approximation, which is the ratio
of the mean of the changes in prices over the mean of the changes in future fuel costs:
$2,550/$3,000 = 0.85. The intuition is that the naive approximation puts too much weight
on changes in the numerator or denominator that are large in absolute value.
The intuition for the issue should be clear: the ratio of the means is not necessarily the
same as the mean of the ratios. Houde and Myers (2019) analyze the appliance energy
efficiency context and show the conditions under which we would expect a bias more
generally, and what the sign of the bias might look like. The insights from the appliance
energy efficiency context carry over to our setting as well. To see the issue mathematically, note that the goal in estimating (D.1) is to consistently estimate the true value of
γ. Consider a case where there is heterogeneity over vehicles in γ, so that we can write
it as γj .28 Our simple example above was one case where there was heterogeneity in γ
across vehicles, and we showed in Table B.6 that there is heterogeneity across car classes,
so we know that empirically there is indeed heterogeneity in γ across vehicles. We are
interested in the mean effect, or E[γj ], where the mean is taken over the population of
vehicles. However, by definition, this is the mean of a ratio: E[γj ] = E[θj /δj ].
To see how this true value (a mean of a ratio) relates to the approximation (a ratio of
means), consider the second-order Taylor expansion:
E[θj /δj ] ≈ E[θj ]/E[δj ] − cov(δj , θj )/E[δj ]2 + V ar(δj )E[θj ]/E[δj ]3 .
28

Houde and Myers (2019) consider heterogeneity over consumers, so it is γi being considered, but the
same logic follows as here.

53

Thus, the value of interest E[γj ] (the mean of the ratio) is only equal to E[θj ]/E[δj ] (the
ratio of the means) when the covariance and variance terms in the equation are equal
to zero (this is a slightly weaker condition than assuming no heterogeneity in γj ). Our
results indicate that there is heterogeneity in γj and our calculations showing a difference
in the results between the two approaches suggest that the higher order terms in the
approximation are important.
Note that several papers in the literature that aim to estimate E[γj ] report a ratio that
corresponds to E[θj ]/E[δj ], as they separately estimate E[θj ] and E[δj ]. This is true for
studies that rely on reduced form methods (Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer 2013; Leard,
Linn, and Zhou 2018) and a similar issue could arise using structural methods (Grigolon,
Reynaert, and Verboven 2018). A key point is that when there is heterogeneity across the
population and a correlation between the response in upfront purchase price and the response in future fuel costs, this correlation will lead the exact measure of undervaluation
to deviate from the approximation. If there is a positive correlation between θ and δ (e.g.,
vehicles for which consumers really do not like a change in upfront purchase price are
more likely to be vehicles for which consumers really do not like a change in future fuel
costs), then this equation would predict that the approximation would be biased upwards
in terms of the valuation.29

29

It is a bias upwards in the valuation because we subtract off the covariance term, so the coefficient
becomes more negative, which means less undervaluation (recall -1 means full valuation, while zero means
not valuing future fuel costs at all).
