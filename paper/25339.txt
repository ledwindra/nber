ABSTRACT
We determine the change in air pollution damages from U.S. power plant emissions over 2010 to
2017. Annual damages fell from $245 billion to $133 billion over this period, with most of the
decline occurring in the East. Decomposition shows that changes in emissions rates reduced
damages by $63 billion, changes in generation shares reduced damages by $60 billion, and a
reduction in fossil generation reduced damages by $25 billion. However, changes in damage
valuations per ton of emissions increased damages by $35 billion. We estimate that marginal
damages declined in the East from about 9¢ per kWh in 2010 to 6¢ in 2017. This decrease is
slower than the decrease in total damages. Despite little or no change in total damages in the
West and Texas, marginal damages increased. The environmental benefit of electric vehicles
increased so that they are now cleaner than gasoline vehicles on average, though substantial
heterogeneity remains. The environmental benefit of solar panels decreased in the East but
increased elsewhere.

Introduction

Electricity is a critical input to firms and households alike. Despite its necessary role in
the economy, electricity generation produces emissions of global and local pollution that
cause hundreds of billions of dollars in damages annually.1 However, during the past decade,
emissions from electricity generation have fallen. Figure 1 shows the emissions of four major
pollutants (sulfur dioxide SO2 , nitrogen oxides NOx , fine particulate matter PM2.5 , and
carbon dioxide CO2 ) from electric power plants in the contiguous U.S. during 2010-2017.2
While emissions of each pollutant declined, some of the reductions are precipitous: SO2 fell
75%. Further, an historical perspective suggests changes in emissions after 2009 (especially
those of SO2 and CO2 ) clearly deviate from past trends.3
The extraordinary decline in emissions from 2010 to 2017 raises three questions. First,
how big was the corresponding decline in damages? Second, how did changes in electricity
generation and pollution valuation interact to bring about this decline? Third, what are the
implications for environmental policy?
Although the changes in emissions shown in Figure 1 are suggestive, how these aggregate patterns affect welfare depends on an assessment of exposure, physical impacts, and,
ultimately, monetized damage. Three factors complicate the translation of emission changes
into damages. First, the importance to total damages of a given pollutant depends not only
on emissions but on damages per unit of emissions as well. Second, damages per unit emission from local pollutants depend on where they are emitted and their dispersion through
the atmosphere. A large decline in emissions need not imply a large decline in damages
if emissions shift from low damage locations to high damage locations. Third, emissions
produced by a particular facility may be more or less harmful over time because of changes
in the levels and demographic composition of local population, atmospheric conditions that
drive the formation of secondary PM2.5 , and the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.

See Figure i in the Appendix. The evidence is less compelling for NOx and PM2.5 . As we shall see,
however, SO2 and CO2 lead to the vast majority of the damages.

Figure 1: Power Plant Emissions of Four Pollutants, 2010-2017

Notes: Normalized such that emissions in 2010 equal 100.

We use the AP3 integrated assessment model (Clay et al 2018) and a time-variant social cost
of carbon to account for these complexities in translating emissions into monetary damages.
We calculate that total annual damages from power plants fell from $245 billion in 2010
to $133 billion in 2017 (damages are reported in real 2014 dollars).4 Most of the decline in
damages is due to SO2 emissions, coal-fired power plants, and the East. The air quality model
in AP3 identifies the locations of the individuals harmed by emissions of local pollutants.
We calculate large reductions in damages ($1232 to $784 per capita) to residents of West
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Furthermore, damages from power plants are regressive
(i.e., higher damages occur to individuals with lower incomes) and the reduction in damages
is progressive.5
4

This result contributes to the growing literature that studies changes in the electricity industry over the
last two decades. Some papers analyze changes in how power markets operate (Knittel et al 2015, Holladay
and LaRiviere 2017, Cullen and Mansur 2017, and Fell and Kaffine 2018) and others attribute changes in
emissions to various factors (Feng et al 2015, Kotchen and Mansur 2016, and Krumholz 2018).
5
These results contribute to the literature on distributional effects and environmental justice (see for
example Gray et al 2012, Fowlie et al 2012, Muller et al 2018, and Holland et al 2019).

2

We decompose the decline in total annual damages of $112 billion into four effects and a
small error.6 Three of these effects decrease damages. The technique effect, which captures
changes in emission rates at a given plant, accounts for $63 billion in decreased damages.
The composition effect, which captures shifts in generation from dirty to cleaner power
plants, accounts for $60 billion. The scale effect, which captures decreasing aggregate fossil
fuel generation, accounts for $25 billion. The fourth effect, valuation, captures changes in
damages from a unit of pollution over time. This effect increased damages by $35 billion.
Dividing these four main effects into component parts provides additional insight. For example, the most important contributor to the scale effect is renewable generation and half
of the composition effect is due to exit of coal plants.
What are the ramifications of these considerable changes in damages for environmental
policy? To answer this question we estimate the marginal damages from electricity consumption.7 Marginal damages declined in the East from 8.6¢ per kWh in 2010 to 6.0¢ per
kWh in 2017. In the West and Texas, the marginal damages in 2010 are much lower (2.0¢
in the West and 2.8¢ in Texas) but have a small but statistically significant increase over
this time period. These patterns suggest convergence across regions. We then analyze what
these changes in marginal damages imply for one policy that encourages grid electricity consumption (subsidies for electric vehicles) and another policy that discourages it (subsidies
for solar panels). We calculate that, from 2010 to 2017, electric vehicles switch from being
dirtier on average than their gasoline-powered counterparts to being cleaner, though con6

Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973) pioneered the use of econometric decomposition to analyze wage
discrimination by decomposing wage differentials into components from different observables (e.g., education)
and from different estimated coefficients (indicating unexplained differences or discrimination). See Fortin
et al (2011) for a summary of decompositions in labor economics. Other papers use decompositions to study
changes in pollution, trade, energy use, and combinations thereof. See Sun (1998), Ang and Zhang (2000),
Antweiler et al (2001), Metcalf (2008), Levinson (2009), Fortin et al (2011), Levinson (2015), Shapiro and
Walker (2018).
7
We extend the earlier analyses of Graff Zivin et al (2014) and Holland et al (2016). Our analysis is
distinguished by the more recent time frame, our multi-pollutant approach, and estimation of standard
errors. Siler-Evans et al (2013) and Callaway et al (2017) use an alternative approach to estimate damages
as a function of fossil electricity generation within an electricity grid region. In sensitivity analyses, we offer
comparable estimates and extend this work by instrumenting for endogenous generation. Other alternatives
use generation cost modeling to simulate grid dispatch and calculate marginal emissions factors: Denhom
et al (2013) and McLaren et al (2016); or simply analyze the average emissions factor e.g., within a state:
Samaras & Meisterling (2008), Michalek et al (2011), and Nealer et al (2015).

siderable cross-sectional heterogeneity remains. The environmental benefit of solar panels
decreases in the East but increases in the West and Texas.
An important caveat is that we do not attempt to assign causal implications to any
one of the myriad public policies and market forces that influence electricity consumption,
generation, and pollution control. On the consumption side, market forces include the rise
in data centers, electrification of transportation, and improvements in heating and cooling
technologies, while public policies encourage energy efficiency and technology adoption.8 On
the generation side, technological improvements in natural gas development and renewable
generation combined with public policies led to a substantial reduction in the relative price of
generating electricity from gas and renewable power plants.9 This in turn decreased wholesale
electricity prices, reduced generation from baseload coal-fired and nuclear generation, led to
plant closings, and increased the need for generation that can quickly respond to intermittent
renewable generation. As for pollution control, between 2010 and 2017, the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) were tightened for both PM2.5 and tropospheric ozone O3 .
States with counties that violate the NAAQS often focus emission reductions on large point
sources such as power plants. There were also a number of active and proposed regulations
during this time that may have influenced adoption of pollution control technology.10 Against
this backdrop of changing market forces and policies we next examine the change in total
damage, before exploring the decomposition, and the implications for environmental policies.

What Happened to Damages

2.1

Methods and Data

To determine damages from air pollution, we define the damage valuations vpit as the damage
per unit of pollutant p emitted by source i at time t and epit as the quantity of emissions.
8

Example policies include weatherization programs, Energy Star rebates for efficient appliances, and
electric vehicle subsidies.
9
Example policies include renewable production tax credits and state level renewable portfolio standards.
10
These include Acid Rain Program (ARP), the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), and the Cross-State
Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), the Clean Power Plan (CPP), and Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS).
Note these regulations may also effect generation.

Total damages Dt are given by
Dt = ∑ ∑ vpit epit .

i

For the global pollutant (CO2 ), the damage valuations are the same across all plants and
are based on EPA’s social cost of carbon (SCC). The SCC is $35.36 in 2010 and grows at
3% annually.11
For local pollutants (SO2 , NOx , and PM2.5 ), we use the AP3 integrated assessment model
to determine damage valuations. AP3 accounts for chemical and physical processes in the
atmosphere to map emissions of pollutants from a source location (i.e., an electric power
plant) into ambient concentrations of PM2.5 at various receptor locations (i.e., counties in
the contiguous United States). It then maps these ambient concentrations into premature
mortality risk using peer-reviewed concentration-response functions.12 Finally, it monetizes
mortality risk using the value of statistical life (Viscusi and Aldy 2003). Let δpijt be the
damages in county j due to emissions of a unit of pollutant p from plant i as determined by
AP3. The damage valuations for local pollutants given by
vpit = ∑ δpijt .
j

Because atmospheric chemistry, background (non-power plant) pollution, and population
change over time, the damage valuations change over time as well. AP3 produces damage
estimates for the years 2008, 2011, and 2014, which are the data years for the National
Emissions Inventory (NEI), a nationally comprehensive inventory of emissions in the U.S.13
For 2010, 2012, and 2013, we use linear interpolation to infer valuations from the NEI years
and, for 2015 on, we hold valuations at 2014 levels.14 Table ii in the Appendix shows a
summary of damage valuations over time.
11

See https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/climatechange/social-cost-carbon_.html.
The prior version of AP3, known as AP2, tracked other consequences of exposure such as morbidity
and visibility. AP3 does not include these endpoints because they contribute a small share of total damage
(<5 percent), and due to concerns about double-counting illness valuations that ultimately culminate in a
premature death. Other differences between AP3 and AP2 are discussed in Online Appendix A.
13
NEI are published with a three year lag (USEPA, 2011; 2014; 2017).
14
Alternatively, we could use linear extrapolation to extend the trend from 2011 to 2014 forward to 2017.
As shown Table B-16 and Figure B-1 in Online Appendix B, our results are robust to this alternative.
12

By calculating total damage as damage valuation times emissions, Eq. (1) assumes that
local damage valuations are independent of the aggregate level of emissions from power
plants. We discuss the validity of this assumption in the Appendix and analyze the implications for our results if it does not hold in Online Appendix A. Briefly, if local damage
valuations are not independent of aggregate emissions, Eq. (1) understates the decline in
damages. Furthermore, an alternative procedure that holds damage valuations (the $/ton
damages) fixed at their final 2017 values overstates the decline in damages. Either way,
the choice of procedure does not significantly affect our results for the decomposition and
marginal damage ($/kwh) estimates.
The U.S. electricity grid is divided into the Eastern, Western, and Texas Interconnections,
and only trivial amounts of electricity flow across their boundaries. For this reason, we
calculate many of our results at the interconnection level. Throughout the paper we refer to
the quantity demanded of electricity as load, and the quantity supplied as generation.15
Our primary data source is EPA’s Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS),
which reports hourly electricity generation and emissions of SO2 , NOx , and CO2 at approximately 1500 regulated fossil-fuel fired power plants (generally above 25 MW capacity). Data
from the NEI is used to impute PM2.5 emissions.16 Additional sources, including Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), EPA’s Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated
Database (eGRID), and Energy Information Administration (EIA), provide data on load,
retail sales, regulations, and plant characteristics and locations. The Appendix gives more
details on our data and the AP3 model.

2.2

Total Damages

Evaluating Eq. (1) for each year gives the damages shown in the rows labelled “Total” in
Table 1. Total damages from emissions of pollutants by CEMS power plants in 2010 were
$245 billion, or about $800 per capita. By 2017, damages had fallen 46% to $133 billion.
15

In theory these should be equal, but in practice they may differ due to reporting practices, line losses,
and net imports from Mexico and Canada.
16
For power plants not identified in the NEI, we assign an average PM2.5 emissions rate.

6

This is a decline of $112 billion or about $369 per capita, which is a substantial benefit to
human health and the environment.
To analyze the sources of the decline in damages, we break up the sums in Eq.(1) in
several ways. Panel A in Table 1 shows the damages by pollutant. In 2010, SO2 emissions
account for the majority of damages ($137 billion) followed by CO2 emissions ($87 billion)
and NOx and PM2.5 emissions ($18 and $10 billion). By 2017, this order had changed with
CO2 emissions accounting for the majority of the damages followed by SO2 , NOx , and PM2.5 .
About 88% of the decline in damages is due to reduction in damages from SO2 emissions.
The large decline in SO2 caused it to become a less important source of harm. Panel B shows
the damages by fuel type. Damages from coal-fired power plants decline dramatically over
time. They account for more than 100% of the decline from 2010 to 2017 because damages
from gas-fired power plants actually increased. Panel C shows the damages by electricity
grid interconnection. The vast majority of damages come from power plants in the East and
almost all of the decline in damages from 2010 to 2017 can be attributed to the East. In
fact, damages from power plants in Texas increased slightly. Taken together, the results in
Table 1 show that the dominant sources of the decline in damages are from SO2 emissions,
from coal plants, and from plants in the East.
To analyze who benefited from the decline in damages, we shift our focus to damages
received by a location. When calculating damages received, we include only local pollution.17
Due to the dispersal of pollutants in the atmosphere, a given location may receive damages
from many power plants. Using the δpijt from AP3, we can write the damages received by
county j as
∑ ∑ δpijt epit .
p

i

Aggregating these damages and accounting for population gives damages received per capita
by state. Figure 2 shows the decline in damages received over the period 2010-2017. The
declines are substantial throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. The average
individual in West Virginia received damages of $1746 in 2010 and $492 in 2017, for a decline
of $1253. Pennsylvania and Ohio also received large per capita reductions in damages ($988
17

The social cost of carbon measures global damages from carbon over hundreds of years. It is difficult to
attribute this damages to specific places in the US.

and $775). Damages and declines are both much smaller in the West. The average individual
in California received damages of $33 in 2010 and $22 in 2017.18
Figure 2: Reduction in Local Damages Received Per Capita (2014$)

Using data on census block groups’ median income and demographics, we can calculate
the local pollution received by income and demographic groups within each county.19 Damages received from power plant emissions are regressive in 2010 and in 2017 both overall and
within racial groups. For example, in 2010 an individual in the lowest income decile received
damages of $610 while an individual in the highest income decile received damages of $462.
By 2017 these damages had fallen to $212 and $152 respectively. Because the decline is
larger for lower income deciles, the decline is progressive.

Online Appendix A contains maps of damages received by county for each year in 2010-2017 (see Figures A-3 to A-10), the decline in damages over 2010-2017 by county (see Figure A-11) and the data used to
generate Figure 2 (see Table A-1).

How Damages Declined

We use a decomposition technique to analyze the ways in which total damages declined. As
a preliminary step, we modify Eq. (1) to account for fossil electricity generation. Letting qit
be electricity generation at fossil plant i at time t and Qt = ∑i qit be total fossil generation,
Eq. (1) becomes
Dt = ∑ ∑ vipt eipt = ∑ ∑ vipt
i

where ript =

eipt

eipt qit
Qt = ∑ ∑ vipt ript θit Qt ,
qit Qt

is the emissions rate for pollutant p and θit =

Qt

(2)

is the share of fossil electricity

generated.20
Next we define the ∆ operator as the difference across year t and year 0 (for example
∆Q = Qt − Q0 ). Differencing both sides of Eq. 2 gives our decomposition:
∆D = ∑ ∑ v ip rip θi ∆Q + ∑ ∑ v ip rip ∆θi Q + ∑ ∑ v ip ∆rip θi Q + ∑ ∑ ∆vip rip θi Q +Error, (3)

where the bar operator indicates our choice of base, which we define to be the average of
values in the initial and final years (for example Q = 12 (Qt + Q0 )). This is analogous to a
Marshall-Edgeworth price index.21 The structure of Eq. (3) resembles the product rule from
differential calculus: we isolate the change in one variable while holding the other variables
constant at the base value. However, it has a non-zero error due to the discrete change in
time. We give a formula for the error in the Appendix. Our decomposition breaks up the
decline in damages into four effects: scale, composition, technique, and valuation.
Table 2 shows these effects over 2010 to 2017. First consider the U.S. total column, which
aggregates damages over all three interconnections. The scale effect (totaling -$25 billion)
20

For plants that enter or exit, we construct a panel across the two years by setting eipt = 0 and qit = 0
for years in which the plant is not generating. When rip0 or ript is undefined, we set it equal to its value
when it is observed. For example, with a plant that enters we set rip0 equal to ript , which is well-defined.
We follow a similar procedure for vipt . This ensures that entry and exit do not contribute to the technique
effect (since emissions rates are constant) or the valuation effect (since valuations are constant).
21
If the base corresponds to values in the initial time period, then the decomposition is analogous to a
Laspeyres price index, and if the base corresponds to values in the final time period, then the decomposition
is analogous to a Paasche price index.

is the decrease in damages that can be attributed to changes in overall fossil generation,
holding valuations, emissions rates, and generation shares constant at their average levels.
Similarly, holding the other variables constant, the composition effect (totaling -$60 billion)
is the decrease in damages from changes in fossil generation shares across power plants. The
technique effect (totaling -$63 billion) is the decrease in damages from changes in power
plant emissions rates. The valuation effect (totaling $35 billion) is the increase in damages
from changes in AP3 valuations and the social cost of carbon. The error is trivial.22 The
table also shows the results for the Eastern Interconnection, which accounts for the bulk of
the decline in damages.23
To better understand each of the effects, we further divide them into component parts
and provide additional context. We begin with the scale effect. Here we consider changes in
load and generation from wind, solar, nuclear, and hydropower.24 To do this, we note that
the change in fossil generation, ∆Q, in Eq. (3) can be written:
∆Q = ∆L − ∆R − ∆N − ∆H − ∆Other,
where ∆L is the difference in load, ∆R is the difference in renewable generation, ∆N is
the difference in nuclear generation, ∆H is the difference in hydroelectric generation, and
∆Other is the residual. We use data on load from FERC form 714 and data on renewable,
nuclear, and hydroelectric generation from EIA form 923 (see Table iii in the Appendix).
Substituting for ∆Q in Eq. (3) gives the results under the Scale heading in Table 2. The
increase in renewable generation is by far the biggest contributor to the scale effect as it
reduced damages by $16 billion.
Anything that changes the generation shares (e.g., market forces or regulations that
shift generation from a coal-fired to a gas-fired plant or cause entry/exit) contributes to the
composition effect. The results under the Composition heading in Table 2 show the effect for
22

Tables B-8 to B-10 present results using the Laspeyres base, the Paasche base and an yet another base
we call the average base. These bases yield much larger errors.
23
See Tables B-4 to B-7 in Online Appendix B for decompositions for each interconnection.
24
There could also be a contribution from efficiency policy, but we cannot observe counterfactual electricity
consumption. Efficiency policy may have offset increases in damages that would have occurred due to
population growth and economic growth induced increases in electricity consumption.

Notes: Total changes do not exactly match the aggregate decline in damages in Table 1 because the decomposition requires that we drop plants reporting zero generation. Fuel types are from eGRID. “Coal” and
“Gas” denote plants whose primary fuel type did not change. “Switch from Coal” denotes plants whose
primary fuel type is coal in 2010 but switches to gas or other fuels in 2017. “Entry” denotes plants that were
not in the 2010 sample and “Exit” denotes plants that were not in the 2017 sample. “Other” denotes the

subsets of the power plants. The decline in generation share from coal plants that operated
throughout the time period reduced damages by $32 billion. This is consistent with Table iii,
which shows that coal’s share of fossil generation fell from 64% to 38%. The exit of coal
plants reduced damages by an additional $31 billion.25 The increase in generation share
from existing gas plants and the entry of new coal and gas plants only increased damages
modestly.
The technique effect captures anything that changes a plants emissions rate including:
installing emissions control equipment, such as scrubbers or low-NOx burners; switching
to low-sulfur coal; replacing a coal-fired boiler with a new gas-fired boiler; or switching
generation at the plant from existing coal generating unit to an existing gas unit. The
results under the Technique heading in Table 2 show the effect for different subsets of the
power plants. The bulk of the technique effect ($36 billion) comes from coal plants that
installed new emissions control technologies. Figure 3 shows a histogram of installation
year for technologies to control SO2 emissions and the price of SO2 allowances in EPA’s
ARP auction. There were a substantial number of installations since 2010.26 Figure 3 also
shows the regulations that are binding on the plants.27 Before 2010, most pollution control
equipment was installed at plants under the ARP or New Source Performance Standard
(NSPS). In 2010 the ARP SO2 price fell to $40 per ton from over $1000 per ton in 2006
but emissions control continued to be installed to comply with other regulations. Additional
installations in 2015-17 were installed at plants under MATS, which was announced in 2011.
Because our emissions rates are measured at the plant level, switching to cleaner fuels
within a power plant also contributes to the technique effect. About $16 billion of the
technique effect is from plants that have coal as their primary fuel source in 2010 but not in
2017. These plants could have replaced coal-fired boilers with gas-fired boilers or switched
generation from existing coal-fired to gas-fired unit. Table B-27 in Online Appendix B shows
25

See Tables B-21 to B-26 in Online Appendix B for additional information on plant entry and exit.
Flue gas desulfurization, or scrubbers, are one type of post-combustion pollution control equipment that
primarily removes particulates such as SO2 . Scrubbers are also one compliance strategy for plants governed
by MATS. Once a scrubber is installed it likely remains active through the life of the plant. Dry sorbent
injection is another type of pollution control technology for SO2 . Figure B-7 in Online Appendix B shows
similar data for NOx pollution control equipment (selective catalytic reduction).

that the within-plant share of generation by coal decreased while the gas share increased from
2010 to 2017.
Finally, the valuation effect shows that changes in valuations increased damages by $35
billion. The valuation of damages from a unit of local pollution emitted at a power plant
may change over time due to changes in factors such as population, atmospheric chemistry
and ambient pollution concentrations. The SCC also increases over this time period. The
results under the Valuation heading in Table 2 show the effect by pollutant. The bulk of the
valuation effect comes from SO2 and CO2 .
The final column of Table 2 exhibits the decomposition holding all damage valuations
fixed at their values in the final year. As discussed in Online Appendix A, this procedure
overstates the reduction in damages even if our assumption that emissions are independent
of damage valuations does not hold. So we expect that the actual reduction in damages is no
greater than $167 billion. By definition, the valuation effect is equal to zero in this column.
But the relative importance of the other effects do not change significantly: the scale effect
is 17%; the composition effect is 42%; and the technique effect is 41%.28
Although Table 2 has the decomposition of the overall change in damages from 2010 to
2017, we can also do the decomposition by year (e.g., decompose the change in damages
from 2010 to each year). The results are shown in Figure 4.29 Damages generally decline
throughout the sample, and the relative importance of the different effects is consistent in
most years. However early in the sample the composition effect dominates. This effect,
which is sensitive to natural gas prices, is relatively large in 2012 and 2016 when gas prices
were low. The technique effect is particularly strong toward the end of the sample. The
valuation effect, which increases until 2014 and then is roughly constant, illuminates our
assumptions about damage valuations.

28

In Table iv in the Appendix, we decompose emissions rather than damages. The technique effect is more
prominent for SO2 .
29
The data for this figure are given in Table B-2 in Online Appendix B. Table B-3 reports small standard
errors for these effects. Standard errors are unnecessary since we have a census of CEMS power plants.
However they inform whether the reductions are similar across plants or are driven primarily by outliers.

Marginal Damages and Policy Analysis

Optimal environmental policies for electricity use depend on marginal damages. Although
electricity generation has become considerably cleaner from 2010 to 2017, this does not
necessarily imply that marginal damages have decreased as well. In this section, we estimate
damage functions and marginal damages and then use the latter to analyze policies for
electric vehicle and solar panel adoption.

4.1

Damage Functions

Consider a damage function that relates air pollution damages to electricity use. Figure 5
illustrates two possible ways in which a damage function may change. In case A on the left,
the damage function rotates down, so that marginal damages do indeed decrease as electricity
generation becomes cleaner. For example, if dirty coal plants retire and are replaced by
cleaner natural gas plants, this leads to lower total damages and lower marginal damages. In
case B on the right, however, the damage function shifts to the right but the slope does not
change. For example, if renewable generation increases, this leads to lower total damages,
but no change in marginal damages.

Empirically assessing changes in damage functions requires several choices. First, the
geographic scope must be determined. Our main analysis focuses on the electricity interconnections: East, West, and Texas.30 Second, the measure of electricity use must be determined. We use load as our primary measure of electricity use but revisit this assumption
below.
We first use non-parametric regressions to estimate the damage function using flexible
functional forms. Figure 6 shows local polynomial regressions for each of the three interconnections in the early (2010-12) and late (2015-17) years of our sample. For the East, the
damage function shifts down between the early and late years indicating that electricity is
cleaner at all load levels. The marginal damage (slope) is positive, and the function appears
to be flatter for 2015-17. The West and Texas are different. There is no clear downward
shift in the damage function. In fact, for these regions the more recent estimated damage
function is lower for low load levels, but higher for high load levels. This suggests that
marginal damages are increasing over time in these regions.31
The univariate non-parametric regressions do not show evidence of substantial nonlinearities. To examine the effect of adding control variables, we regress damage and load on
hour of day by month of sample fixed effects, and then repeat the non-parametric regressions
on the residuals. The results are shown in Figure C-4 in Online Appendix C. Once again we
see no substantial non-linearities, so we turn to linear regression.

4.2

Estimating Marginal Damages

Parametric regression analysis allows us to estimate marginal damages precisely and to
statistically test whether marginal damages changed. Our main estimating equation is
Dt = βLoadt + γLoadt Y eart + αmh + t ,
30

(4)

We explore other definitions of geographic scope in Appendix Table C-4.
Figures C-1to C-3 in Online Appendix C also present the damage functions as functions of fossil generation, which shows that the general relationship between load and damages is similar whether we measure
electricity usage by load or by fossil generation.

Figure 6: Local polynomial estimates of damage functions

Notes: Graphs are local polynomial regressions of hourly damages on
hourly load for the three interconnections: Eastern, Western, and Texas.
Load measured in thousands of MWhs, and damages measured in millions
of 2014$. In East, mean load is 339 and mean damages is 21. In Texas,
mean load is 39, and mean damage is 1.8. In West, mean load is 85, and
mean damage is 2.2.

19

where Dt is damages from emissions in hour t, Loadt is load in hour t, αmh are month of
sample times hour fixed effects (8 years * 12 months * 24 hours fixed effects), and Y eart
is the annual trend since 2010. The coefficients of interest are β, which is the marginal
damage, and γ, which is the annual change in the marginal damage. We specify units such
that marginal damages are in $ per kWh and estimate Newey-West standard errors using 24
hour lags.
The results of estimating Eq. (4) are given in Table 3. For the East, the marginal damage
estimate over the sample is $0.073 per kWh with a tight standard error. This is a substantial
cost relative to the average retail price of electricity($0.13 per kWh in 2017).32 The year
trend shows a statistically significant decrease in marginal damages over this time frame
starting at about $0.086 per kWh in 2010 and decreasing by about $0.0038 per kWh per
year to about $0.06 per kWh in 2017. Figure 7 illustrates this trend line and shows that the
annual point estimates are tightly clustered around the trend line.33 In the West and Texas,
the marginal damages estimated over the sample are much lower: $0.025 per kWh in the
West and $0.032 per kWh in Texas. However, the trends show increasing marginal damages
of $0.001 per kWh per year. This increase is small but is statistically significant. Annual
estimates with confidence intervals, shown in Figure 7, are again tightly clustered around
the increasing trend lines.
Marginal damages are appropriate for policy, but total damages and average damages
(damages divided by load) are frequently used measures of grid cleanliness.34 To compare
these measures, we calculate compound annual growth rates. The results are shown in Table 4. The compound annual growth rates for total and average damages are similar to each
other, but they substantially overstate the decline in marginal damages in all three regions.
These differences suggest that focusing on total or average damages gives a misleading implication for the degree to which policies may need to be adjusted due to the cleaner electricity
generation.

Our main results weight all hours equally. These results can be used to evaluate a
use of electricity that is distributed uniformly across hours and seasons, e.g., refrigeration.
However, other electricity uses may have different profiles. For example, electric vehicle
charging occurs primarily in the nighttime with some charging at midday but very little
charging during peak commuting hours. Electric lighting is primarily at night, whereas
industrial applications may use electricity primarily during the day. Air conditioning, one
of the heaviest uses, occurs primarily during the day in the summer months. Table 5 shows
results for a variety of profiles. For the East, relative to the main results, the electric vehicle
charging profile shows increased marginal damages and a steeper decline. Conversely, the
Day Time Hours profile shows lower marginal damages and a shallower decline. Overall, the
differences are larger across regions than across profiles within a region.
We apply the results in Table 5 to assess two prominent environmental policies. First is
the subsidy for electric vehicle purchases. Electric vehicles cause air pollution damages due
to the emissions from power plants that charge them. Gasoline vehicles cause damages due to

emissions from their tailpipes. Holland et al (2016) show that the environmental benefit of an
electric vehicle is equal to the damages from the forgone gasoline vehicle minus damages from
the electric vehicle. We use estimates of marginal damages in the electric vehicle charging
profile row in Table 5 to determine the damages from the electric vehicle. For the gasoline
vehicle, we use emissions from Holland et al (2016) and damage valuations from AP3 to
determine damages. Table 6 shows the summary statistics for the distribution of the annual
environmental benefit across all counties in the contiguous U.S. For 2010, the average value
of the environmental benefit (assuming 15,000 miles per year) is slightly negative (-$81 per
year) with a substantial range across counties from -$390 to $781. In 2017, the environmental
benefit increases by about $150 so the average is now positive. The increase is largest in the
East: about $200 across the distribution. Even though marginal damages from electricity
use increased in both the West and Texas, the environmental benefit of electric vehicles has
increased in these regions because damages from gasoline vehicles grew faster. Overall, the
environmental benefit increases over time, but considerable heterogeneity across counties
remains. Holland et at (2016) show that the optimal purchase subsidy for an electric vehicle
is equal to the lifetime environmental benefit. For comparison, all electric vehicles in the
U.S. are eligible for a federal tax credit of $7,500 and many states offer additional incentives.
Using the 2017 environmental benefits and assuming a 10 year lifetime and a 3% discount
rate, the federal subsidy is much greater than the NPV of the average lifetime environmental
benefit ($630), but smaller than the NPV of the maximum lifetime environmental benefit
($8250).
The second policy is the subsidy for household solar adoption. The electricity from solar
panels reduces the demand for grid electricity and thus reduces air pollution damages. In
this case the environmental benefit is simply the product of the electricity created by the
panel and the marginal damages from electricity generation in the interconnection in which
the panel is located. Following the methodology in Siler-Evans et al (2013), Vaishnav et al
(2017), and Sexton et al (2018), we combine information on solar insolation with marginal
damage estimates from the Day Time Hours row in Table 5.35 Table 7 shows the summary
statistics for the distribution of environmental benefit per year for a 6 kW system across

See details on solar insolation in Online Appendix C.

approximately 83,000 unit areas in the contiguous U.S. Overall the mean benefit is $418 in
2010 with a range across locations from $94 to $830. In 2017, the mean benefit fell to $356 and
the range narrowed. Across regions, the environmental benefit is largest in the East because
the grid is dirtiest. The environmental benefit decreased in the East (because marginal
damages fell) but increased in the West and Texas (because marginal damages increased).
Overall, these changes caused the range of the environmental benefit to become smaller in
2017. Solar panels are eligible for a tax credit of 30%, which implies a subsidy $5652 for the
average system.36 Using the 2017 environmental benefits and assuming a 20 year lifetime
and a 3% discount rate, the average environmental benefit ($5455) is approximately equal
to the subsidy.

4.3

Robustness

The regression in Eq. (4) estimates the damage function as the relationship between electricity load and damages. This may underestimate marginal damages if load is correlated
with omitted non-fossil generation. An alternative specification that estimates damages as
a function of fossil generation may have endogeneity bias. This bias can be large if interregional trading is not modeled.37 Table C-3 in Online Appendix C explores potential
endogeneity bias in our estimates. In particular, we use two alternative specifications: one
with fossil generation as the independent variable and another that instruments for fossil
generation with electricity load. Table C-3, which shows the three specifications for levels
and annual trend models, finds that the bias is not extreme, likely due to our aggregation
to the interconnection level.
Our modeling requires assumptions about key parameters. Table 8 explores the robustness of our marginal damage estimates to other reasonable assumptions about these
parameters. Our main results use AP3 damage valuations for NEI years (2008, 2011 and
2014) and interpolate valuations for non-NEI years. Column (2) presents estimates in which
all damage valuations are held fixed at the final year values.38 Under the fixed valuations,
36

credits. The average cost of a 6 kW system is $18840.
37
Marginal distributional losses are another possible source of bias (Borenstein and Bushnell 2018).

the 2010 point estimates are higher and marginal damages fall more or increase less. In
particular, the Texas trend is statistically insignificant instead of positive. Another important assumption is the social cost of carbon. Columns (3) & (4) use high and low values for
the SCC. The high SCC values increase the marginal damages (and low values decrease the
marginal damages). The trends are more positive for the higher SCC values reflecting the
higher growth of the SCC. Column (5) uses a smaller VSL than our baseline calculation.39
This change has the greatest effects on the results, particularly in the East where damages
are higher. Overall, the results are largely robust to these different modeling assumptions.

Baseline VSL is $8.8 million and the smaller value is $3.3 million.

Conclusion

Since 2010, the U.S. population grew by over five percent and real gross domestic product
expanded by more than 15 percent. Despite these trends, electric power consumption remains effectively unchanged. Concurrently, emissions of several important pollutants have
fallen. This paper translates emissions into monetary damage, finding that the total annual
damages from emissions fell by $112 billion, or 46 percent, over eight years. The benefits of
these reduced emissions were particularly concentrated among low-income households and
households in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states.
This paper decomposes the change in damages into four effects. The technique effect
measures within plant changes in emission rates. This contributed $62 billion in decreased
damages. The composition effect, which captures changes in generation shares across plants,
contributed a similar amount ($60 billion). By comparison, the entry of renewables and
reduction in load produced a fall in damages that was considerably smaller (the scale effect
is about $25 billion). Running counter to these three effects, the valuation of damage per
unit of emissions increased damages by $35 billion. This phenomenon was driven by changes
in the composition of the atmosphere, population growth and demographic change, and
increases in the social cost of carbon.
The paper also examines the ramifications of changes to the electricity sector for environmental policy. Our econometric analysis of the relationship between load and damages
reveals that marginal damages did fall in the Eastern Interconnection but at a much slower
rate than total damages or average damages. Despite lower overall emissions in the Western and Texas Interconnections, marginal damages have increased in these markets. We find
that grid-powered electric vehicles are now cleaner than gasoline vehicles, on average, though
substantial heterogeneity remains.
Although the paper demonstrates an extraordinary reduction in both damages and emissions from the U.S. power generation sector, we offer the following caveats. First, this is not a
causal analysis of which policies and market forces drove these changes. We explore plausible
explanations, but do not disentangle them completely. The installation of scrubbers was the
result of several state and federal policies including the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.

29

The fuel switching and coal plant retirements were likely affected by the decreased prices for
natural gas due to hydraulic fracturing. Renewable investment was likely affected by policies like the federal Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit, states’ Renewable
Portfolio Standards, and technological improvements that have lowered costs and improved
operations. Second, the application of AP3 to estimate air pollution damage imparts considerable uncertainty on our results. This arises through parameter uncertainty (especially
the VSL and the functional linkage between exposure to PM2.5 and adult mortality), and
through the representation of air quality modeling in AP3. Third, we also note that the social cost of carbon is a necessarily uncertain parameter, both in its level and rates of change
through time.
The results presented in this paper provide useful benchmarks for future research on
the causes behind the reported changes in emissions and damages. For example, low gas
prices could cause the composition effect and parts of the technique effect, but are unlikely
to cause increases in renewable generation or lead to installation of pollution control equipment on coal plants. The paper also effectively demonstrates the importance of tracking
emissions through to their final monetary damage. Simply reporting emission reductions,
while an important step, masks crucial heterogeneity in the toxicity of different pollutants,
changes in the exposed populations, and trends in valuation due to changes in environmental
conditions.

Appendix
Details on Emissions Data
The CEMS (Continuous Emissions Monitoring System) database is part of EPA’s Air Markets Program.40 CEMS power plants do not include non-fossil power plants, small fossil
plants (capacity < 25 MW), and plants in Hawaii or Alaska. The CEMS database provides
hourly emissions of SO2 , NOx , CO2 , and gross generation, which includes electricity use
within the plant. We measure a plant’s annual PM2.5 emissions through the following steps.
First, we calculate its emissions rate as the ratio of PM2.5 emissions from the National Emissions Inventory over the annual gross generation from CEMS. The NEI is only available every
third year (2008, 2011, and 2014) and only for some plants. For years not in the NEI, we use
linear interpolation. Average emissions rates are assigned to plants not in the NEI. Second,
we calculate PM2.5 emissions at a plant as the product of these rates and the plant’s gross
generation from CEMS. Table i shows annual emissions of the pollutants from the CEMS
data. Figure 1 illustrates this same data normalized to 2010 emissions.

For a historical perspective, we illustrate emissions from 1990-2016 in Figure i.41 For each
pollutant, the solid line shows power plant emissions normalized to 1 in 1990. The dashed
line shows the trend line from a regression based on data from 1990 to 2009, and the dotted
line shows the rolling five-year percentage change in emissions. For SO2 and CO2 , emissions
from 2010 to 2017 clearly deviate below trend.

Notes: SO2 , NOx , and PM2.5 damages in 2014$ per pound are the unweighted average of the damage per

that year. CO2 damages in 2014$ per metric ton.

Details on AP3
Table ii summarizes the AP3 damage valuations across the pollutants. Although AP3 reports damage valuations for all counties and for different stack heights, we focus on damage
valuations at reporting CEMS power plants. The table shows the mean damage valuations
across the unbalanced panel of power plants. Reflecting our interpolation assumptions, local
pollutant damages are flat after 2014. Also included in Table ii are CO2 damage valuations,
which increase throughout the sample period.
As discussed in the main text, we assume that damage valuations are independent of
aggregate power plant emissions. This assumption may not hold because atmospheric conditions affect the efficiency with which emissions of NOx and SO2 form secondary PM2.5 .
In particular, damage valuations in AP3 are generally increasing over time from 2008-2014.
This is due, at least in part, to lower total emission levels of NOx and SO2 over time,
which leaves considerably more free ammonia (NH3 ) in the atmosphere. This implies that
marginal emissions of NOx and SO2 are more likely to interact with the free ammonia to
form ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate, both of which are important constituents
of ambient PM2.5 . And at least part of the decreased total NOx and SO2 emissions may be
due to reduction in power plant emissions. In Online Appendix A, we discuss an alternative
procedure to determining the decline in damages and show how our main procedure and the

33

alternative procedure can be used to put bounds on the decline in damages when damage
valuations and power plant emissions are not independent.

Details on Electricity Generation
Table iii shows electricity generation by fuel type over time from EIA Form 923. Gas, solar,

Details on Decompositions
Deriving a decomposition formula involves specifying the base; writing the main terms of
the decomposition formula in terms of the base and changes in the variables, and then
determining the error. Here we derive the error for our Marshall-Edgeworth base. First note
that the LHS of Eq. 3 can be written ∆D = ∑i ∑p ∆(vip rip θi Q). Ignoring the summations

and subscripts we can write the decomposition as42
¯
∆(vrθQ) = v̄r̄θ̄∆Q + v̄r̄∆θQ
+ v̄∆rθ̄θQ + ∆vr̄θ̄θQ + Error
where
Error = (v̄∆r∆θ∆Q + ∆vr̄∆θ∆Q + ∆v∆rθ̄∆Q + ∆v∆r∆θQ̄)/4
The Error for Eq. 3 simply sums this equation over all i and p.
In the main paper, we present decompositions of damages. We can also decompose
emissions. We set vipt = 1 for every i, p, and t in Eq. (3) and calculate the decomposition for
each pollutant separately (rather than summing over p). The results are given in Table iv
(expressed in percentage of total emissions in 2010).

42

To derive the decomposition, note that the difference of a product can be written ∆(xy) = ∆xȳ + x̄∆y
and the mean of a product can be written xy = x ⋅ y + ∆x∆y/4. Repeatedly applying these formulas to the
product vrθQ yields the decomposition and error.
