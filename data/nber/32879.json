    "abstract": "\n\nWe show the incidence of mental ill-health has been rising especially among the young in the years and especially so in Scotland.  The incidence of mental ill-health among young men in particular, started rising in 2008 with the onset of the Great Recession and for young women  around 2012. The age profile of mental ill-health shifts to the left, over time, such that the peak of depression shifts from mid-life, when people are in their late 40s and early 50s, around the time of the Great Recession, to one\u2019s early to mid-20s in 2023.  These trends are much more pronounced if one drops the large number of proxy respondents in the UK Labour Force Surveys, indicating fellow family members understate the poor mental health of respondents, especially if those respondents are young. We report consistent evidence from the Scottish Health Surveys and UK samples from Eurobarometer surveys.  Our findings are consistent with those for the United States and suggest that, although smartphone technologies may be closely correlated with a decline in young people\u2019s mental health, increases in mental ill-health in the UK from the late 1990s suggest other factors must also be at play.\n\n",
