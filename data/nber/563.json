    "abstract": "\n\nA linearized version of the rational expectations models of the term structure is put forth in terms of a complete vector of equally spaced observations along the yield curve. A data series on intermediate maturity yields which meets the specifications of the model is presented. The model is tested against a specific and easily interpreted alternative. Earlier studies of rational expectations models, which used \"volatility tests\" or \"likelihood ratio tests,\" are discussed.\n\n",
