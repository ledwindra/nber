JEL No. E24,E32,G01,G12
ABSTRACT
A search and matching model, when calibrated to the mean and volatility of unemployment in the
postwar sample, can potentially explain the large unemployment dynamics in the Great Depression.
The limited response of wages to labor market conditions from credible bargaining and the congestion
externality from matching frictions cause the unemployment rate to rise sharply in recessions but decline
gradually in booms. The frequency, severity, and persistence of unemployment crises in the model
are quantitatively consistent with U.S. historical time series.

Introduction

Figure 1 plots the monthly U.S. unemployment rates from April 1929 to December 2012 (see Section 2 for sample construction). The mean unemployment rate is 6.97%, and the median rate is
5.70%. The most striking feature of the ﬁgure is the extraordinarily high levels of unemployment
in the 1930s, known as the Great Depression. From January 1931 to December 1939, the average
unemployment rate is 17.57%, and the highest unemployment rate reaches 25.59% in May 1933.
In contrast, such large unemployment dynamics are absent in the postwar sample. We ﬁt a threestate Markov chain on the unemployment rate series via maximum likelihood. Identifying months
in which the unemployment rate is above 20% as a crisis state, we estimate the unconditional
probability of an unemployment crisis to be 2.76% and its persistence (the probability of a crisis
next period conditional on a crisis in the current period) to be 88.89%.
We ask whether a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model of equilibrium unemployment, when

1

calibrated to the mean and volatility of unemployment in the postwar sample, can explain the large
unemployment dynamics in the Great Depression. Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is aﬃrmative.
Unemployed workers search for vacancies posted by a representative ﬁrm. A matching function
takes vacancies and unemployed workers as inputs to produce the number of new hires in the labor
market. Because of matching frictions, the vacancy ﬁlling rate decreases with the tightness of the
labor market measured as the ratio of the number of vacancies over the number of unemployed
workers. Deviating from the standard wage determination via a generalized Nash bargaining game,
we follow Hall and Milgrom (2008) to derive the equilibrium wage as the outcome of a credible
bargaining game. In this setup, both parties make alternating oﬀers that can be accepted, rejected
to make a counteroﬀer, or rejected to take outside options. Relative to the Nash wage, the credible
bargaining wage is more insulated from conditions in the labor market.
Our key ﬁnding is that the model, calibrated to match the mean of 5.84% and the volatility
of 13.48% for the unemployment rate in the postwar sample, can match the persistence and the
unconditional probability of the crisis state in the full sample. The persistence of the crisis state is
86.96% in the model, and its unconditional probability is 3.18% (with a cross-simulation standard
deviation of 7.72%). The volatility of unemployment in the model’s crises samples is 0.233, which
is more than twice as large as 0.109 in normal periods. Remarkably, the model moment is close to
the unemployment volatility of 0.219 in the long U.S. sample from April 1929 to December 2012.
The unemployment dynamics in the model are large and extremely nonlinear. In booms unemployment declines only gradually, whereas in recessions unemployment rises drastically. The
model’s empirical stationary distribution of unemployment is highly skewed with a long right tail.
Also, impulse responses are stronger in recessions than in booms. In response to a negative onestandard-deviation shock to log labor productivity, the unemployment rate increases only by 0.05%
if the economy starts at the 95 percentile of the model’s stationary distribution of employment and
productivity. In contrast, the unemployment rate jumps by 1.06% (more than 20 times larger) if
the economy instead starts at the 5 percentile of the bivariate distribution.

The probability of breakdown in wage bargaining and the delaying cost incurred by the ﬁrm
during each round of alternating oﬀers (which are two key parameters in the credible bargaining
game) are quantitatively important for the crisis dynamics in the model. A higher probability of
breakdown, in which both parties take outside options, brings credible bargaining closer to Nash
bargaining and makes the equilibrium wage more response to labor market conditions. In recessions, labor productivity falls, but the wage also drops, making proﬁts less sensitive to downturns
and providing the ﬁrm with incentives to create jobs. As such, crisis dynamics in unemployment
are dampened. In contrast, a higher delaying cost makes the equilibrium wage more insulated from
labor market conditions. As output falls in recessions, the wage does not fall as much, meaning
that proﬁts must drop disproportionately more. As such, crisis dynamics are strengthened.
The congestion externality also plays a role in driving our results. The congestion arises because
in booms many vacancies compete for a small pool of unemployed workers. An extra vacancy can
cause a large drop in the vacancy ﬁlling rate, raising the marginal cost of hiring. In contrast, in
recessions many unemployed workers compete for a small pool of vacancies. An extra vacancy is
quickly ﬁlled, and the vacancy ﬁlling rate can hardly increase further. As such, the marginal cost
of hiring runs into a downward rigidity in recessions. This eﬀect is also buttressed by the ﬁxed
matching cost that puts a constant component into the marginal cost of hiring.
Consider a large negative shock to labor productivity. Output falls, but proﬁts plummet more
because the credible bargaining wage is relatively insulated from aggregate conditions. To make
matters worse, the marginal cost of hiring runs into the downward rigidity, failing to decline to
counteract the impact of plummeting proﬁts on the ﬁrm’s incentives of hiring. As a result, unemployment rises drastically, giving rise to crises. Quantitatively, the log productivity levels that are
two and three unconditional standard deviations below its unconditional mean would lead to unemployment rates of 13% and 28%, respectively. To reach the crisis threshold of 20% unemployment
rate, the log productivity must drop 2.62 unconditional standard deviations below the unconditional
mean. Most important, the search and matching model endogenizes unemployment crises similar
3

to the Great Depression, even though the exogenous driving force is a ﬁrst-order autoregressive
process with homoscedastic lognormal shocks as in the standard business cycle literature.
To evaluate the quantitative importance of credible bargaining in the model, we experiment with
the baseline search model with the equilibrium wage determined from the standard Nash bargaining.
We ﬁnd that the model can quantitatively explain the same crisis dynamics in unemployment, but
only with either an excessively high ﬂow value of unemployment activities or an extremely high ﬁxed
matching cost. Both calibrations do not appear realistic. As such, we conclude that the credible
bargaining framework is essential in providing a realistic microfoundation for unemployment crises.
The theoretical foundations for the search model of unemployment are provided by Diamond
(1982), Mortensen (1982), and Pissarides (1985). Shimer (2005) contributes a simple yet profound
insight that the unemployment volatility in the baseline search model is too low relative to that
in the data.1 As noted, our model is built on Hall and Milgrom (2008), who show that replacing
the Nash wage with the credible bargaining wage helps explain the volatility puzzle. Going beyond
the volatility puzzle in the labor market, our central contribution is to push the search model of
unemployment to explain the crisis dynamics of unemployment in the Great Depression.
Kuehn, Petrosky-Nadeau, and Zhang (2013) embed the search model of unemployment into
an equilibrium asset pricing framework. With recursive preferences, their work focuses on asset
prices and related consumption disasters. Our work diﬀers by focusing on labor market dynamics
(in particular, unemployment crises as well as their impact on the second moment of the labor
market). Most important, we move beyond the Nash bargaining to the Hall and Milgrom (2008)
credible bargaining to provide a rich microfoundation for unemployment crises.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 documents the nonlinear dynamics in the

A large subsequent literature has developed to tackle the volatility puzzle. In particular, Hall (2005) shows how
wage stickiness, which satisﬁes the condition that no worker-ﬁrm pair has any unexploited opportunity for mutual
gain, increases labor market volatilities. Mortensen and Nagypál (2007) and Pissarides (2009) show that the ﬁxed
recruiting cost can explain the volatility puzzle. Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) show that a calibration with small
proﬁts and a low bargaining power for the workers can produce realistic volatilities. Petrosky-Nadeau and Wasmer
(2013) show how incorporating ﬁnancial frictions can generate higher labor market volatilities.

calibrates the model and discusses its accurate solution algorithm. Section 5 quantiﬁes the model’s
crisis dynamics in unemployment. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

Evidence on Unemployment Crises

We construct a monthly time series for the U.S. unemployment rate stretching back to April of 1929
by drawing from NBER macrohistory ﬁles. We access the data via Federal Reserve Economic Data
(FRED) at Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. We concatenate four diﬀerent series of the U.S. unemployment rate: (i) the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate from April 1929 to February 1940
(NBER data series m08292a, FRED series ID: M0892AUSM156SNBR); (ii) the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate from March 1940 to December 1946 (NBER data series m08292b, FRED series
ID: M0892BUSM156SNBR); (iii) the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) from January
1947 to December 1947 (NBER data series m08292c, FRED series ID: M0892CUSM156NNBR);
and (iv) the seasonally adjusted civilian unemployment rate from January 1948 to December 2012
from Bureau of Labor Statistics at U.S. Department of Labor (FRED series ID: UNRATE).
To model the tail behavior in the U.S. unemployment rate series plotted in Figure 1, we follow
Chatterjee and Corbae (2007) to ﬁt a three-state Markov chain model via maximum likelihood. The
aggregate state of the economy, η ∈ {g, b, c}, evolves through good (g), bad (b), and crisis (c) states
with diﬀerent employment prospects. Let the transition matrix of the Markov Chain be given by:
⎡

λgg λbg λcg

⎢
Λ = ⎣ λgb

λbb

λgc

λbc

⎤

⎥
λcb ⎦ ,
λcc

(1)

in which, for example, λgb ≡ Prob{η t+1 = g|η t = b} is the probability of the economy being in
state g next period conditional on the economy being in state b in the current period.
As discussed in Chatterjee and Corbae (2007), the maximum likelihood estimate of λkj , which
is the (j, k)th element of the aggregate state transition matrix, is the ratio of the number of times

5

the economy switches from state j to state k to the number of times the economy is in state j.
Let, for example, 1{ηt =j} denote the indicator function that takes the value of one if the economy
in period t is in state j and zero otherwise. The maximum likelihood estimate of λkj is given by:
T −1
λ̂kj =

1{ηt+1 =k} 1{ηt =j}
.
T −1
t=1 1{η t =j}

t=1

(2)

In addition, the asymptotic standard error for λ̂kj is given by:
Ste(λ̂kj ) =

λ̂kj (1 − λ̂kj )
.
T
t=1 1{η t =j}

(3)

In practice, we identify the good state, g, as months in which the U.S. unemployment rate is
below the median unemployment rate of 5.70%. We deﬁne the crisis state, c, as months in which
the U.S. unemployment rate is above or equal to 20%. The bad state, b, is then identiﬁed as months
in which the unemployment rate is below 20% but above or equal to the median of 5.70%. We
choose the crisis cutoﬀ rate of 20% judiciously such that (i) the cutoﬀ rate is relatively high; but
(ii) there are still a suﬃcient number of months in which the economy hits the crisis state so that
the transition probability estimates can be (relatively) precise.
Table 1 reports the estimated aggregate state transition matrix. The crisis state is persistent
in that the probability of the economy remaining in the crisis state conditional on it being in the
crisis state is 88.9%. This estimate is also precise, with a small standard error of 0.061. With a
probability of 11.1%, the economy switches from the crisis state to the bad state. Unconditionally,
the tail probability of the economy being in the crisis state is estimated to be 2.76%.

The Model

We construct a search model of unemployment embedded with credible bargaining in determining
the equilibrium wage as in Hall and Milgrom (2008).

The Environment

The model is populated by a representative household and a representative ﬁrm that uses labor as
the single productive input. Following Merz (1995) and Andolfatto (1996), we use the representative
family construct, which implies perfect consumption insurance. The household has a continuum
with a unit mass of members who are, at any point in time, either employed or unemployed. The
fractions of employed and unemployed workers are representative of the population at large. The
household pools the income of all the members together before choosing per capita consumption
and asset holdings. Finally, the household is risk neutral with a time discount factor of β.
The representative ﬁrm posts a number of job vacancies, Vt , to attract unemployed workers, Ut .
Vacancies are ﬁlled via a constant returns to scale matching function, G(Ut , Vt ), speciﬁed as:
G(Ut , Vt ) =

Ut Vt
(Utι

+ Vtι )1/ι

,

(4)

in which ι > 0 is a constant parameter. This matching function,speciﬁed as in Den Haan, Ramey,
and Watson (2000), has the desirable property that matching probabilities fall between zero and one.
Deﬁne θt ≡ Vt /Ut as the vacancy-unemployment (V /U ) ratio. The probability for an unem-

7

ployed worker to ﬁnd a job per unit of time (the job ﬁnding rate), denoted f (θt ), is:
G(Ut , Vt )

f (θt ) ≡

(5)

The probability for a vacancy to be ﬁlled per unit of time (the vacancy ﬁlling rate), denoted q(θt ), is:
q(θ t ) ≡

G(Ut , Vt )
1
=
.
Vt
(1 + θιt )1/ι

(6)

It follows that q  (θ t ) < 0: An increase in the scarcity of unemployed workers relative to vacancies
makes it harder to ﬁll a vacancy. As such, θ t is labor market tightness from the ﬁrm’s perspective.
The representative ﬁrm incurs costs in posting vacancies. Following Mortensen and Nagypàl
(2007) and Pissarides (2009), we incorporate a ﬁxed component in the unit cost per vacancy:
κt ≡ κ0 + κ1 q(θt ),

(7)

in which κ0 is the proportional cost, κ1 is the ﬁxed cost, and both are nonnegative. The proportional
cost is standard in the literature. The ﬁxed cost captures training, interviewing, and administrative
setup costs of adding a worker to the payroll, costs that are paid after a hired worker arrives but
before wage bargaining takes place. The marginal cost of hiring arising from the proportional cost,
κ0 /q(θ t ), is time-varying, but that arising from the ﬁxed cost is constant, κ1 .
Jobs are destroyed at a constant rate of s > 0 per period. Employment, Nt , evolves as:
Nt+1 = (1 − s)Nt + q(θ t )Vt ,

(8)

in which q(θt )Vt is the number of new hires. The size of the population is normalized to be unity,
Ut = 1 − Nt . As such, Nt and Ut are also the rates of employment and unemployment, respectively.
The ﬁrm takes aggregate labor productivity, Xt , as given. The law of motion for xt ≡ log(Xt ) is:
xt+1 = ρxt + σ

8

t+1 ,

(9)

in which ρ ∈ (0, 1) is the persistence, σ > 0 is the conditional volatility, and

t+1

is an independently

and identically distributed standard normal shock. The ﬁrm uses labor to produce output, Yt , with
a constant returns to scale production technology,
Yt = Xt Nt .

(10)

The dividends to the ﬁrm’s shareholders are given by:
Dt = Xt Nt − Wt Nt − κt Vt ,

(11)

in which Wt is the equilibrium wage rate. Taking q(θt ) and Wt as given, the ﬁrm posts an optimal
number of job vacancies to maximize the cum-dividend market value of equity, denoted St :

(12)

t=0

subject to the employment accumulation equation (8) and a nonnegativity constraint on vacancies:
Vt ≥ 0.

(13)

Because q(θt ) > 0, this constraint is equivalent to q(θ t )Vt ≥ 0. As such, the only source of job
destruction in the model is the exogenous separation of employed workers from the ﬁrm.2
Let λt denote the multiplier on the nonnegativity constraint q(θt )Vt ≥ 0. From the ﬁrst-order
conditions with respect to Vt and Nt+1 , we obtain the intertemporal job creation condition:

q(θt+1 )

(14)

Intuitively, the marginal cost of hiring at time t equals the marginal value of employment to the
ﬁrm, which in turn equals the marginal beneﬁt of hiring at period t + 1, discounted to t. The
marginal beneﬁt at t + 1 includes the marginal product of labor, Xt+1 , net of the wage rate, Wt+1 ,
2
The constraint is occasionally binding in simulations from the baseline search model with Nash bargaining.
Because a negative vacancy makes no economic sense, we impose the nonnegativity constraint throughout the paper.

9

plus the marginal value of employment, which equals the marginal cost of hiring at t + 1, net of
separation. Finally, the optimal vacancy policy also satisﬁes the Kuhn-Tucker conditions:
q(θt )Vt ≥ 0,

λt ≥ 0,

and

λt q(θ t )Vt = 0.

(15)

Let Ct denote consumption. In equilibrium, the goods market clearing condition says:
Ct + κt Vt = Xt Nt .

(16)

Equilibrium Wages with Credible Bargaining

To close the model, we need to specify how the wage rate, Wt , is determined in equilibrium. In the
standard Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, the wage rate is derived from the sharing rule per
the outcome of a generalized Nash bargaining process between the employed workers and the ﬁrm
(e.g., Pissarides (2000, Section 1.4)). Let 0 < η < 1 be the workers’ relative bargaining weight and
b the workers’ value of unemployment activities. The Nash-bargained wage rate is:
Wt = η (Xt + κt θt ) + (1 − η)b.

(17)

Although analytically simple, the baseline search model with the Nash wage requires an extremely
high replacement ratio (i.e., the value of unemployment activities over the average marginal product
of labor) to reproduce realistic labor market volatilities (e.g., Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008)).
We adopt the credible bargaining wage proposed by Hall and Milgrom (2008). Built on Binmore,
Rubinstein, and Wolinsky (1986), Hall and Milgrom place a crucial distinction between a threat
point and an outside option in the wage bargaining game. Bargaining takes time. Both parties
make alternating oﬀers which can be accepted, rejected to make a counteroﬀer, or rejected to abandon the bargaining altogether. In the standard Nash bargaining, disagreement leads immediately
to the abandonment of the bargaining game, meaning that the relevant threat point is the outside
options for both parties. In contrast, in the more realistic alternating bargaining, disagreement only

10

leads to another round of alternating oﬀers. The threat point is the payoﬀ from another round of
alternating oﬀers, and outside options are taken only when abandoning the bargaining altogether.
The outside option for a worker is the value of unemployment, and that for the ﬁrm is zero.
During a period in which both parties engage in another round of alternating oﬀers, the worker
receives the ﬂow value of unemployment activities, b, and the ﬁrm incurs the cost of delaying,
χ > 0. During this period, the negotiation can also break down with a probability of δ.
With this setup of the alternating bargaining game, the indiﬀerence condition for a worker when
considering a wage oﬀer, Wt , from the ﬁrm is:

that the ﬁrm is just indiﬀerent between the payoﬀ from accepting the worker’s oﬀer Wt and the
payoﬀ from rejecting the oﬀer to have an opportunity to make a counteroﬀer of Wt+1 in the next
period. When rejecting the oﬀer, the ﬁrm pays the delaying cost of χ if the bargaining does not
break down. When the negotiation does break down, the ﬁrm’s payoﬀ is zero.
The two indiﬀerence conditions collapse to the indiﬀerence conditions for the standard Nash
bargaining when the probability of breakdown, δ, equals one. During the alternating bargaining,
it is optimal for each party to make a just acceptable oﬀer. As in Hall and Milgrom (2008), we
assume that the ﬁrm makes the ﬁrst oﬀer, which the worker accepts. As such, Wt is the equilibrium
wage, and the delaying cost, χ, is never paid in equilibrium.

(20)

in which ft ≡ f (θt ) is the job ﬁnding rate. The equation says that the value of unemployment

period. With a probability of ft , the unemployed worker lands a job, which delivers the value of

In addition, the marginal value of an employed worker to the household is:

The equation says that the value of employment equals the ﬂow value of employment, Wt , plus

separates from the ﬁrm, and returns to the labor market as an unemployed worker with a value of
W

increases in the surplus that the worker would enjoy after making a counteroﬀer, Wt+1

From the last term in equation (22), the equilibrium wage, Wt , also increases in the separation rate,
s. As s goes up, the expected duration of the job shortens. As such, the worker requires a higher
wage to remain indiﬀerent between accepting and rejecting the wage oﬀer. Finally, Wt increases in
the job ﬁnding rate, ft . As ft rises, the worker’s outside job market prospects improve, and the ﬁrm
must oﬀer a higher wage to make the worker indiﬀerent. However, this impact of labor market conditions on Wt becomes negligible as the probability of breakdown in the bargaining, δ, goes to zero.
The wage oﬀer of a worker to the ﬁrm, Wt , can be expressed as:


W
W
Wt = Xt + (1 − δ)χ + βEt (1 − s)SN

(23)

Intuitively, Wt increases in labor productivity, Xt , and the cost of delay to the ﬁrm, χ. A higher
χ makes the ﬁrm more likely to accept a higher wage oﬀer from the worker to avoid any delay. As
Wt contains a higher constant proportion because of a higher χ, Wt becomes more insulated from

the equilibrium wage, Wt , becomes less sensitive to aggregate conditions as a result of a higher χ.
From the last term in equation (23), an increase in the separation rate reduces the wage oﬀer
from the worker to the ﬁrm, Wt . As s rises, the present value of proﬁts produced by the worker
drops. To make the ﬁrm indiﬀerent, the worker must reduce the wage oﬀer. Also, the worker’s oﬀer,


Wt , increases (naturally) in the ﬁrm’s surplus from accepting the oﬀer, SN
t+1 . In contrast, the

13

W
worker’s oﬀer would be lower if the ﬁrm’s surplus, SN
t+1 , from rejecting the oﬀer to make a coun-

teroﬀer, Wt , is higher. However, the quantitative importance of this channel would be negligible if
the breakdown probability, δ, goes to one. As such, Wt increases with δ.
Finally, the two parties of the credible bargaining game would agree to accept the equilibrium
wage if the joint surplus of the match is greater than the joint value of the outside options, JU t , as
well as the joint present value of continuous delaying:

The last equality holds because the ﬂow value of unemployment, b, is higher than b−χ (the delaying
cost is positive). We verify that this condition holds in simulations.

Calibration and Computation

We calibrate the model in Section 4.1 and discuss its solution algorithm in Section 4.2.

4.1

Calibration

Our calibration strategy is to match the mean and the volatility of the unemployment rate in the
postwar sample, before quantifying the model’s performance in explaining the nonlinear dynamics
documented in Section 2. Calibrating to the unemployment dynamics in normal periods seems
sensible as the common practice in the existing literature. Because of the strong nonlinearity in the
model, steady state relations hold very poorly in simulations. As such, we do not use these relations.
Table 2 lists the parameter values for the monthly calibration of the benchmark model. The
time discount factor, β, is set to be e−5.524/1200 = 0.9954. This value implies a discount rate of
5.524% per annum, which is the leverage-adjusted aggregate discount rate in the 1951–2012 sample.3 To calibrate the log labor productivity, we set its persistence, ρ, to be 0.951/3 = 0.983 as in
3

We obtain monthly series of the value-weighted stock market returns, one-month Treasury bill rates, and
inﬂation rates from January 1951 to December 2012 from Center for Research in Security Prices. The average real
interest rate (one-month Treasury bill rates minus inﬂation rates) is 0.895% per annum. The equity premium (the
value-weighted market returns in excess of one-month Treasury bill rates) is on average 6.807%. Because we do not

Gertler and Trigari (2009). We then calibrate its conditional volatility, σ, to match the standard
deviation of labor productivity in the data. We measure the labor productivity as seasonally adjusted real average output per job in the nonfarm business sector (Series id: PRS85006163) from
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The sample is quarterly from 1951 to 2012. We detrend the series
as the Hodrick-Prescott (1997, HP) ﬁltered cyclical component of proportional deviations from the
mean with a smoothing parameter of 1,600. The standard deviation of the detrended series is 0.012
in the data. With a value of 0.00635 for σ, the implied standard deviation from the model is 0.013.
We set the job separation rate, s, to be 4.5%, which is higher than 3.78% from the Job Openings
and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). However, Davis, Faberman, Haltiwanger, and Rucker (2010)
show that the JOLTS sample overweights establishments with stable hiring and separation and underweights volatile establishments with rapid growth or contraction. Adjusting for this bias, Davis
et al. (Table 5.4) estimate the separation rate to be 4.96%. For the elasticity parameter in the matching function, ι, we set it to be 1.25, which is close to that in Den Haan, Ramey, and Watson (2000).
Following Hall and Milgrom (2008), we calibrate the value of unemployment activities to be
0.71. The probability of breakdown in bargaining, δ, is 0.1 in our monthly frequency, and is close
to Hall and Milgrom’s value of 0.0055 in their daily calibration (with 20 working days per month).
model ﬁnancial leverage, we calculate the leverage-adjusted equity premium as (1 − 0.32) × 6.807% = 4.629%, in
which 0.32 is the aggregate market leverage ratio of U.S. corporations reported in Frank and Goyal (2008). Taken
together, the leverage-adjusted aggregate discount rate in the data is 4.629% + 0.895% = 5.524%.

15

The delaying cost parameter, χ, is set to be 0.25, which is close to 0.27 in Hall and Milgrom.
To calibrate the recruiting cost parameters, κ0 and κ1 , we target the ﬁrst and the second
moments of the unemployment rate in U.S. postwar sample. As noted, the mean unemployment rate
in the sample from January 1951 to December 2012 is 5.84%. To calculate the second moment, we
follow a similar procedure in Shimer (2005). We ﬁrst convert the monthly series to a quarterly series
by taking the monthly average unemployment rate within a given quarter. We detrend the quarterly
series as the HP-ﬁltered cyclical component of proportional deviations from the mean with a smooth
parameter of 1,600. The standard deviation of the detrended series is 13.48% in the data. We end
up with the recruiting cost parameters, κ0 = 0.15 and κ1 = 0.1, which imply a mean of 5.75% and
a standard deviation of 10.94% for the unemployment rate in the non-crisis states in the model.

4.2

Computation

Because we focus on the higher moments of unemployment, the standard loglinearization cannot be
used. We instead adapt the projection algorithm ﬁrst developed in Kuehn, Petrosky-Nadeau, and
Zhang (2013) to our setting. The state space consists of employment and log productivity, (Nt , xt ).
The goal is to solve for the optimal vacancy function, Vt = V (Nt , xt ), the multiplier function, λt =
λ(Nt , xt ), and the equilibrium wage, Wt = W (Nt , xt ), from the following ﬁve functional equations:

Christiano and Fisher (2000), we then exploit a convenient mapping from Et to policy and multiplier
functions to eliminate the need to parameterize the multiplier function separately.4 We approximate
the log productivity process, xt , in equation (9) based on the discrete state space method of
Rouwenhorst (1995).5 We use 17 grid points to cover the values of xt , which are precisely within four
unconditional standard deviations from the unconditional mean of zero. For the Nt grid, we set the
minimum value to be 0.001 and the maximum 0.99. The range is suﬃciently large so that Nt never
hits one of the bounds in simulations. On each grid point of xt , we use cubic splines with 20 basis
functions on the Nt space to approximate the ﬁve functions. We use extensively the approximation
toolkit in the Miranda and Fackler (2002) CompEcon Toolbox in MATLAB. To obtain an initial
guess, we use the loglinear solution to a simpliﬁed model without the ﬁxed matching cost.
Figure 2 reports the approximation errors for the ﬁve functional equations from (25) to (29).
The error for each equation is the left-hand side minus the right-hand side of the equation. The
errors, in the magnitude no greater than 10−13 , are extremely small. As such, our projection
algorithm does an accurate job in characterizing the competitive search equilibrium.

Quantitative Results

We examine the model’s stationary distribution in Section 5.1, and quantify the model’s performance in matching higher moments of unemployment in Section 5.2. Section 5.3 studies the second
moments of the labor market. Section 5.4 contains nonlinear impulse response functions. Section
5.5 presents an array of comparative statics to illustrate the intuition behind the results.
4

Speciﬁcally, after obtaining the parameterized Et , we ﬁrst calculate q̃(θt ) ≡ κt /Et . If q̃(θt ) < 1, the nonnegativity
constraint is not binding, we set λt = 0 and q(θt ) = q̃(θt ). We then solve θt = q −1 (q̃(θt )), in which q −1 (·) is the
inverse function of q(·) from equation (6), and Vt = θt (1 − Nt ). If q̃(θt ) ≥ 1, the nonnegativity constraint is binding,
we set Vt = 0, θt = 0, q(θt ) = 1, and λt = κt − Et .

Kopecky and Suen (2010) show that the Rouwenhorst method is more accurate than other methods in
approximating highly persistent autoregressive processes.

Properties of the Stationary Distribution

We simulate the economy for one million monthly periods from the model’s stationary distribution.
To reach the stationary distribution, we start at the initial condition of zero for log labor productivity and 0.90 for employment, and simulate the economy for 6,000 months. We perform a battery of
diagnostics on the one-million-month simulated sample to study the model’s stationary distribution.
Panel A of Figure 3 plots the unemployment rate against labor productivity in simulations. The
relation is strongly nonlinear. When labor productivity is above its mean of unity, unemployment
goes down only slightly. However, when labor productivity is below its mean, unemployment goes
up drastically. The correlation between unemployment and productivity is −0.654.
Panel B plots labor market tightness, θt , against productivity. Although the relation is nonlinear, the nonlinearity is not nearly as dramatic as that of unemployment in Panel A. The main source
of nonlinearity in Panel B seems the nonnegativity constraint on vacancy. When the constraint is
binding with lower values of labor productivity, θ t is ﬁxed at zero. In contrast, when the constraint
is not binding with higher values of productivity, the θ t -productivity relation is (virtually) linear.
Figure 4 further illustrates the nonlinearity. Using the one-million-month simulated data, we
report the empirical cumulative distribution functions of unemployment and labor market tightness.
From Panel A, unemployment is highly skewed with a long right tail.

The skewness of the

unemployment rate is 6.12. The 2.5 percentile, 4.73%, is close to the median of 5.32%, but the
97.5 percentile is far away, 11.34%. Also, the 1 percentile is 4.69%, but the 99 percentile is 15.65%.
In contrast, Panel B shows that the empirical distribution of the labor market tightness is largely
symmetric. Finally, the minimum unemployment rate is 4.55%, but the maximum rate is 47.64%.

5.2

Explaining Higher Moments of Unemployment Quantitatively

Can the search and matching model explain quantitatively the nonlinear unemployment dynamics
in the data, including the aggregate state transition matrix and the tail probability of the crisis state
in Table 1? To this end, from the model’s stationary distribution, we repeatedly simulate 100,000

number of months in the data from April 1929 to December 2012.
Because crises, which are rare by deﬁnition, do not occur in every simulated sample, we split the
100,000 samples into two groups, non-crisis samples and crisis samples. If the maximum unemployment rate in an artiﬁcial sample is greater than or equal to 20%, we categorize it as a crisis sample
(otherwise a non-crisis sample). The cutoﬀ threshold of 20% is consistent with our empirical procedure in Section 2. Out of the 100,000 simulations, we have in total 17,412 crisis samples (17.41%).
On each crisis sample (i.e., conditional on at least one crisis), we calculate the state transition matrix and unconditional probabilities of the states using the exactly the same procedure as in Table
1. We then report the cross-simulation averages and standard deviations across the crisis samples.6
Table 3 reports the model output. A comparison with Table 1 shows that the model does a
good job in explaining the large unemployment dynamics in the data. In particular, the crisis state
is almost as persistent in the model as in the data. The probability of the economy remaining in
the crisis state next period conditional on the crisis state in the current period is 86.96%, which is
close to 88.89% in the data. The switching probability from the crisis state to the bad state in the
model is 12.92%, which is close to 11.11% in the data. In addition, the unconditional probability of
the crisis state in the model is 3.18%. Although somewhat higher than 2.76% in the data, the crosssimulation standard deviation of this estimate is 7.72%. This high standard deviation is perhaps not
surprising for a tail probability estimate. As such, the model’s estimate seems empirically plausible.
To what a low level must the log productivity process fall to trigger a crisis with the threshold
level of 20% unemployment rate? To obtain a quantitative sense, we ﬁrst use an illustrative crisis
sample. Panel A of Figure 5 plots the unemployment rate, and Panel C plots the log productiv6

We have experimented with simulating only 5,000 artiﬁcial samples, and the quantitative results are hardly
changed under the benchmark calibration. However, we ﬁnd that in comparative static experiments (Section 5.5)
the results with 5,000 simulations can be sensitive to the increase of the number of simulations. Intuitively, the
percentage of crisis samples can be small. As a result, the cross-simulation averages can be sensitive due to the small
number of crisis samples being averaged over. To ensure precision in our quantitative results, we opt to work with
100,000 artiﬁcial samples for each of the parameterizations studied in the paper.

Table 3 : Aggregate State Transition Matrix and Unconditional Probabilities of the Three
Economic States, the Credible Bargaining Model
From the model’s stationary distribution, we simulate 100,000 artiﬁcial samples, each with 1,005 months.
We split the samples into two groups: non-crisis samples (in which the maximum unemployment rate is less
than 20%) and crisis samples (in which the maximum rate is greater than or equal to 20%). On each crisis
sample, we calculate the state transition matrix and unconditional probabilities of the states as in Table 1.
We report the cross-simulation averages and standard deviations (in parentheses) across the crisis samples.

ity. A deep crisis occurs around the 300th month (the crisis sample has 1,005 months) with the
log productivity drops more than three unconditional standard deviations below the unconditional
mean of zero. In response, the unemployment rate hits almost 30%. Two other episodes with high
unemployment rates around 13% occur shortly after the 400th month and the 700th month, when
the log productivity dips just below the two-unconditional-standard-deviation bound.
The example is only illustrative. To provide a more precise answer, we conduct an event study
using all the crisis samples out of the 100,000 simulations. In each crisis sample, we deﬁne the
month in which the maximum unemployment rate occurs as event time 0. We record both the
unemployment rates and the log productivity during 60 months prior to the event. We then average the pre-event unemployment rates and the pre-event log productivity across all the crisis
samples. Panel B of Figure 5 plots the average unemployment, and Panel D plots the average log
productivity, both in even time. By averaging across all the crisis samples, the event study makes
the unemployment-log productivity relation (conditional on a crisis occurring) more precise.
Panels B and D are informative. When the log productivity falls one unconditional standard
deviation below the unconditional mean of zero, the unemployment rate is about 8%. When the log

The unemployment rate hits 28% when the log productivity falls three unconditional standard
deviations below the mean. Using interpolation, we ﬁnd that to reach the threshold of 20% unemployment, the log productivity needs to drop 2.62 unconditional standard deviations below zero.

5.3

The Impact on the Second Moments of the Labor Market

The nonlinear dynamics in the search model has important implications for the second moments
such as volatilities and correlations, which are the traditional focus of the literature. In particular,
it can be misleading to focus only on the second moments in normal periods (non-crisis samples).
The second moments in the crisis samples can deviate greatly from those in normal periods.
We ﬁrst report a standard set of second moments in the data as in Shimer (2005). Unlike
the unemployment rate, the data for vacancies and labor productivity are available only for the
postwar sample. We obtain seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment (thousands of persons 16
years of age and older) from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and seasonally adjusted help wanted
advertising index from the Conference Board. The sample is from January 1951 to June 2006. (The
Conference Board switched from help wanted advertising index to help wanted online index in June
2006. The two indexes are not directly comparable. We follow the common practice in the macro
labor literature in using the longer time series before the switch.) We take quarterly averages of
the monthly series to obtain quarterly observations. The average labor productivity is seasonally
adjusted real average output per job in the nonfarm business sector from BLS.
It is customary to report all variables in log deviations from the HP-trend with a smoothing
parameter of 1,600. In contrast, we detrend all variables as the HP-ﬁltered cyclical component of
proportional deviations from the mean with the same smoothing parameter. We do not take logs
because vacancies can be zero in simulations when the nonnegativity constraint of vacancy is binding. (In the data, the two detrending methods yield quantitatively similar results.) Panel A of Table
4 reports the data moments in the postwar sample. The standard deviations of unemployment,

24

vacancy, and the labor market tightness are 0.119, 0.134, and 0.255, respectively. Unemployment
and vacancy have a correlation of −0.913, indicating a downward-sloping Beveridge curve.
To quantify the model’s implications for the second moments of the labor market, we simulate
100,000 artiﬁcial samples, each with 1,005 months, from the model’s stationary distribution. We
again split the samples into two non-crisis samples and crisis samples, with the maximum unemployment rate of 20% as the threshold. We then apply the same empirical procedures as in Panel
A of Table 4, and report the cross-simulation averages and standard deviations.
Panel B reports the results conditional on the non-crisis samples (normal periods). As a calibration target, the unemployment volatility is 0.109, which is close to 0.119 in the data. Although not
a direct target, the standard deviation of vacancy is 0.146 in the model, which is also close to 0.134
in the data. However, the model predicts a standard deviation of labor market tightness of 0.185,
which is lower than 0.255 in the data.7 In addition, although negative, the unemployment-vacancy
correlation is −0.572 in the model, which is lower in magnitude than −0.913 in the data. Finally,
in contrast to the correlation of 0.299 between the labor market tightness and productivity in the
data, the correlation is nearly perfect in the model, likely reﬂecting its single-shock structure.
However, focusing only on normal periods suﬀers from a sample selection bias that ignores the
crisis samples. Panel C reports the quantitative results conditional on the crisis samples. The standard deviations of vacancy and labor market tightness are not much aﬀected, 0.158 and 0.204 in the
crisis samples versus 0.146 and 0.185 in the non-crisis samples, respectively. However, the unemployment volatility shoots up to 0.233, which is more than twice as large as 0.109 in normal periods.
We apply the same procedure in Panel A of Table 4 on the unemployment rate series from April 1929
7

The standard deviation of labor market tightness has traditionally been the focus of the macro labor literature,
stimulated by Shimer (2005). Many studies argue that some modiﬁcations of the baseline search model can explain the
volatility puzzle. However, reinforcing Shimer’s key message, Petrosky-Nadeau and Zhang (2013) argue that once the
model is solved accurately with a globally nonlinear algorithm, it is diﬃcult to explain the volatility of labor market
tightness without blowing up the volatility of unemployment. In particular, the authors show that loglinearization
understates the standard deviation of unemployment, overstates the magnitude of the unemployment-vacancy
correlation, and misses completely the nonlinear dynamics in unemployment. Petrosky-Nadeau and Zhang make
their argument in the context of Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008). However, the argument is likely to apply more
generally wherever a search model admits nontrivial nonlinear dynamics.

Table 4 : Labor Market Volatilities, Data and the Credible Bargaining Model
In Panel A, seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment (U , thousands of persons 16 years of age and older)
is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The seasonally adjusted help wanted advertising index, V , is from
the Conference Board. The sample is monthly from January 1951 to June 2006 (666 months). Both U and V
are converted to quarterly averages of monthly series. We deﬁne the labor market tightness as θ = V /U . The
average labor productivity, X, is (quarterly) seasonally adjusted real average output per job in the nonfarm
business sector from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. All variables are in HP-ﬁltered proportional deviations
from the mean with a smoothing parameter of 1,600. In Panels B to D, we simulate 100,000 artiﬁcial samples
from the model’s stationary distribution, with 1,005 months in each sample. We split the samples into two
groups: non-crisis samples (in which the maximum unemployment rate is less than 20%) and crisis samples
(in which the maximum rate is greater than or equal to 20%). We take the quarterly averages of monthly
U, V , and X to convert to quarterly series. We implement the same procedure as in Panel A, and report
cross-simulation averages and standard deviations (in parentheses). We do so conditionally on the non-crisis
samples (Panel B) and on the crisis samples (Panel C) as well as unconditionally (Panel D).

such, the unemployment volatility in the crisis samples in the model is close to that in the long sample in the data. The unemployment-vacancy correlation also varies a lot between non-crisis samples
and crisis samples, −0.572 in the non-crisis samples versus −0.329 in the crisis samples (Panel C).
These results are intrinsically linked to the nonlinear dynamics shown in Figures 3 and 4. Precisely because unemployment exhibits a long right tail, ignoring unemployment crises by focusing
only on the second moments in normal periods understates drastically the unemployment volatility.
Also, because the nonlinearity of vacancy (and labor market tightness) is substantially weaker than
that of unemployment, ignoring the crisis periods overstates the unemployment-vacancy correlation,
but the standard deviations of vacancy and labor market tightness are not materially aﬀected.

5.4

Nonlinear Impulse Response Functions

The nonlinear dynamics also impact on impulse response functions. The magnitude of the impulse
responses depends on the initial point of simulations as well as the sign of the initial shock. We calculate the impulse responses from three diﬀerent starting points: bad, median, and good economies.
The bad economy is the 5 percentile of the model’s bivariate stationary distribution of employment and log productivity (Ut = 8.95%, xt = −0.0567), the median economy is the median (Ut =
5.32%, xt = 0), and the good economy is the 95 percentile (Ut = 4.78%, xt = 0.0564). We compute
the responses to a one-standard-deviation shock to log productivity, both positive and negative.
Figure 6 reports the nonlinear impulse response functions for the benchmark model. Two nonlinear patterns are clearly visible for unemployment. First, the impulse responses are substantially
larger for the bad economy than for the good economy. After a negative one-standard-deviation
shock, the unemployment rate shoots up by 1.06% in the bad economy (Panel A). This response
is 20 times as large as the response of 0.05% in the good economy (Panel C). The response in the
median economy is only 0.13% (Panel B), which is closer to that in the good economy.
Second, the responses to a negative shock are larger in magnitude than those to a positive shock

Figure 6 : Nonlinear Impulse Response Functions
We compute the impulse response functions from three diﬀerent initial points: the ﬁve percentile, the median,
and the 95 percentile of the model’s bivariate distribution of employment and log productivity, respectively.
The responses in unemployment are in levels. All the other responses are in percentage deviations from the
respective values at a given initial point. The impulse responses are averaged across 100,000 simulations,
each of which has 120 months. The blue solid (red broken) lines are the responses to a positive (negative)
one-standard-deviation shock to log productivity.

of the same magnitude. As noted, in the bad economy, the unemployment rate shoots up by 1.06%
in response to a negative one-standard-deviation shock. In contrast, with the same initial condition, the unemployment rate drops by only 0.85% in response to a positive one-standard-deviation
shock, which is about 80% in magnitude of the response to a negative shock.
Similar asymmetric responses are present in output. In the bad economy, a negative onestandard-deviation shock to log productivity causes output to drop by 1.74% (Panel D). In contrast,
in the good economy, output drops only by 0.65% (Panel F), which is about 37% of the response
in the bad economy. In addition, the positive one-standard-deviation shock causes output to rise
by 1.54%, which is somewhat smaller than the percentage drop in response to a negative shock.
The response in labor market tightness is also stronger in the bad economy than that in the
good economy. However, in contrast to unemployment and output, the response to a positive shock
is similar in magnitude to that to a negative shock, controlling for the same initial condition. In the
bad economy, a negative impulse reduces the labor market tightness by up to 21.74%, and a positive
impulse increases the tightness by 24.74% (Panel G). In contrast, in the good economy, a negative
impulse reduces the tightness by 5.36%, and a positive impulse increases it by 5.39% (Panel I).
Panels J to L illustrate and quantify the limited response of wages to conditions in the labor market in the credible bargaining model. Even starting in the bad economy, a one-standard-deviation
negative shock to log labor productivity only reduces the wage by a 0.56%. This wage response in
the bad economy is quantitatively similar to that in the good economy, 0.42%.

5.5

Comparative Statics: What Drives Large Unemployment Dynamics?

To illustrate the intuition behind the large unemployment dynamics in the model, we conduct an
array of comparative statics. We perform in total six computational experiments: (i) increasing
the probability of breakdown in bargaining to δ = 0.15; (ii) reducing the delaying cost to χ = 0.20;
(iii) reducing the proportional cost of vacancy posting to κ0 = 0.10; (iv) removing the ﬁxed cost of
vacancy posting with κ1 = 0; (v) reducing the job separation rate to s = 0.035; and (vi) reducing
29

the matching function function parameter to ι = 0.625. In each experiment, all the other parameters remain ﬁxed as in the benchmark calibration. We quantify how the results reported in Tables
3 and 4 change as we vary each of the parameter values.
Table 5 reports the results for the crisis moments, and Table 6 for the second moments of the
labor market. From Panel A of Table 5, increasing the probability of breakdown in negotiation,
δ, weakens the crisis dynamics in the model. The percentage of the crisis samples out of 100,000
simulated samples drops from 17.41% under the benchmark calibration to only 0.15%. Conditional
on the crisis samples, the persistence of crisis weakens somewhat from 0.87 to 0.84, and the unconditional crisis probability falls from 3.18% to 1.24%. Table 6 shows further that raising δ decreases
the unemployment volatility in both non-crisis and crisis samples. A higher δ also leads to a higher
magnitude of the unemployment-vacancy correlation, especially for normal times.
These results are intuitive. A higher probability of breakdown in negotiation brings credible
bargaining closer to Nash bargaining. In the extreme case of δ = 1, credible bargaining collapses
to Nash bargaining, which implies a more ﬂexible wage process. As such, a higher δ makes the
equilibrium wage more responsive to labor market conditions. In bad times, productivity drops,
but the wage also falls with the deteriorating state of the labor market for workers, providing the
ﬁrm with incentives to create jobs. As such, the volatility of employment falls, consistent with Hall
and Milgrom (2008). We push their argument further by showing that a more ﬂexible wage process
also substantially reduces the probability of unemployment crises.
The delaying cost is also quite important for matching the crisis moments. From Panel B of Table 5, reducing χ from 0.25 under the benchmark calibration to 0.20 lowers the percentage of the crisis samples out of 100,000 simulations from 17.41% to only 0.12%. Conditional on the crisis samples,
the persistence of crisis weakens somewhat from 0.87 to 0.79, and the unconditional crisis probability
falls from 3.18% to 1.44%. Panel B of Table 6 shows further that reducing χ lowers both the mean
unemployment rate to 4.90% and the unemployment volatility to 0.027 in normal times. In the crisis

Table 5 : Comparative Statics, Aggregate State Transition Matrix and Unconditional
Probabilities of the Three Economic States
We consider six comparative static experiments: (i) an increase in the probability of breakdown in bargaining
to δ = 0.15; (ii) a reduction in the delaying cost to χ = 0.20; (iii) a reduction in the proportional cost of
vacancy t0 κ0 = 0.10; (iv) an elimination of the ﬁxed cost of vacancy, κ1 = 0; (v) a reduction in the job
separation rate to s = 0.035; and (vi) a reduction in the curvature parameter of the matching function
to ι = 0.625. In each experiment, all the other parameters remain identical to those in the benchmark
calibration. Under each alternative calibration, we simulate 100,000 artiﬁcial samples (each with 1,005
months) from the model’s stationary distribution. We split the samples into two groups: non-crisis samples
(in which the maximum unemployment rate is less than 20%) and crisis samples (in which the maximum
rate is greater than or equal to 20%). On each crisis sample, we calculate the state transition matrix and
unconditional probabilities of the states per the procedure in Table 1, and report cross-simulation averages.

samples, however, the unemployment volatility, 0.244, is barely changed from 0.233 under the benchmark calibration. As such, the diﬀerence across normal times and crisis samples becomes starker
with a lower χ as the crises become infrequent. Another indication of the starker diﬀerence is the
unemployment-vacancy correlation, which is −0.765 in normal times but −0.231 in crisis samples.
The proportional and the ﬁxed costs of vacancy posting impact the results in the same direction
as the cost of delaying, but to a lesser extent quantitatively. From Table 5, reducing κ0 from 0.15
to 0.10 lowers the persistence of the crisis state from 0.87 to 0.80 and its unconditional probability
from 3.18% to 2.24%. The percentage of the crisis samples out of 100,000 simulations also drops
from 17.41% to 11.63% (Panel C). Similarly, reducing κ1 from 0.10 to zero lowers the persistence
of the crisis state to 0.77 and its unconditional probability to 1.86%. Also, the percentage of crisis
samples drops to 8.04%. From Table 6, lowering κ0 and κ1 also reduces the volatility of unemployment, especially in normal times. These results are again intuitive. Lower vacancy costs stimulate
the ﬁrm to create jobs to starve oﬀ unemployment crises. In particular, the ﬁxed matching cost
buttresses the downward rigidity in the marginal cost of hiring. Removing the ﬁxed cost weakens
the rigidity, allowing the marginal cost of hiring to decline and more jobs to be created in recessions.
From Panel E of Table 5, reducing the job separation rate, s, makes crises less frequent and
less persistent. Reducing s from 4.5% to 3.5% reduces the persistence of the crisis state somewhat
from 0.87 to 0.85 and the unconditional crisis probability from 3.18% to 2.25%. A lower s also
reduces the mean unemployment rate from 5.75% to 4.36%, but leaves the second moments of the
labor market largely unaﬀected (Table 6). Intuitively, because jobs are destroyed at a slower rate,
all else equal, the economy is more capable of oﬀsetting job destruction ﬂows through job creation.
As such, the mean unemployment rate is reduced, and the crisis dynamics dampened.
Finally, from Panel F of Table 5, halving the curvature of the matching function makes the crisis
state more frequent. The persistence remains around 0.87, but the unconditional crisis probability
goes up somewhat from 3.18% from 3.51%. Intuitively, a decrease in ι increases the elasticity of

33

matching with respect to vacancies.8 As such, the congestion eﬀect becomes greater in recessions to
reinforce the crisis dynamics of unemployment. Panel F of Table 6 shows that more severe matching frictions also increase the mean unemployment rate to 10.25% in normal times, but reduce the
unemployment volatility in both normal times and crisis samples. Intuitively, matching frictions
work as labor adjustment costs to dampen the unemployment volatility (e.g., Shimer (2010)).

5.6

The Nash Wage

To examine the role of the Hall and Milgrom (2008) credible bargaining, we report the quantitative results from the baseline search model with the Nash wage. Instead of equation (22), we
assume that the wage rate is derived from the generalized Nash bargaining process between the
employed workers and the ﬁrm. As noted, the Nash wage is given by equation (17). Apart from
the equilibrium wage, the rest of the model remains identical to the credible bargaining model.
The computation of the Nash bargaining model is substantially simpler than that of the credible bargaining model. Instead of ﬁve functional equations from (25) to (29), we only need to solve
equation (25). We continue to approximate the conditional expectation in the right-hand side of
equation (25) as Et ≡ E(Nt , xt ). We use the discrete state space method of Rouwenhorst (1995) with
17 grid points to approximate xt . The Nt grid is again from the minimum value of 0.01 to the maximum of 0.99. Because the Nash bargaining model sometimes exhibits strong nonlinearity, we choose
to use cubic splines with 40 basis functions on the Nt space to approximate E(Nt , xt ) on each grid
point of xt . To obtain an initial guess, we use the loglinear solution without the ﬁxed matching cost.
Table 7 reports the monthly parameter values for the Nash bargaining model. We consider two
calibrations, one with a high value of unemployment activities (small surplus) and the other one
with a high ﬁxed matching cost. Panel A reports the parameters common to both calibrations.
The time discount factor, β, the job separation rate, s, the elasticity parameter in the matching
function, ι, as well as the persistence, ρ, and the conditional volatility, σ, of the log productivity
8
To be precise, the elasticity of matches with respect to vacancies function is given by 1/(1 + θιt ). A decrease in
ι increases this elasticity for θ > 1, which holds in the model’s simulations.

remain the same as in the credible bargaining model.
The value of b involves two components. Mulligan (2012) estimates a median replacement rate
in the U.S. of 63%, which covers a variety of income support programs available to workers. We also
assume a leisure component in b. In Panel B (the small surplus calibration), we follow Hagedorn
and Manovskii (2008), who argue that in a perfectly competitive labor market, b should be close
to the value of employment. We choose a high value of b = 0.90, but also conduct a comparative
static experiment with b = 0.85. We set the workers’ bargaining weight, η, to be 0.045 so that the
wage elasticity to labor productivity in the model is 0.50, which is close to the 0.45 estimate in
Hagedorn and Manovskii. To calibrate κ0 and κ1 , we then target the mean and volatility of the
unemployment rate in U.S. postwar sample. This procedure yields κ0 = κ1 = 0.3, which imply a
mean of 5.81% and a volatility of 10.7% for unemployment in the non-crisis state in the model.
Several authors such as Mortensen and Nagypál (2007) and Hall and Milgrom (2008) argue
that the Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) calibration of b is too high. As such, we also examine an
alternative calibration that emphasizes the ﬁxed matching cost, following Pissarides (2009). In this

Results are based on 100,000 artiﬁcial samples, each with 1,005 months. We split the samples into two
groups: non-crisis samples (in which the maximum unemployment rate is less than 20%) and crisis samples
(in which the maximum unemployment rate is greater than or equal to 20%). On each crisis sample, we
calculate the state transition matrix and unconditional probabilities of the states per the procedure in Table
1. We report the cross-simulation averages and standard deviations (in parentheses) across the crisis samples.

calibration we set b = 0.71 as in Hall and Milgrom. We then choose κ0 and κ1 to bring the mean
and volatility of unemployment in the non-crisis state in the model as close as possible to those in
the postwar sample. We end up with κ0 = 0.05 and κ1 = 3.1, which imply a mean of 5.79% and a
volatility of 9.8% in normal times in the model. We also conduct comparative statics on κ1 .
Quantitative Results from the Small Surplus Calibration
Can the Nash bargaining model, when calibrated to the mean and volatility of unemployment in
the postwar U.S. sample, explain quantitatively the higher moments of unemployment in the data
(Table 1)? Panel A of Table 8 shows that the model with the small surplus calibration seems to do
a good job. The persistence of the crisis state in the model is 0.88, which is very close to 0.89 in the
data. The unconditional probability of the crisis state in the model is 3.81%. Although somewhat
higher than 2.76% in the data, the cross-simulation standard deviation of this estimate is 7.40%.
Finally, the percentage of crisis samples out of 100,000 simulations is 43.53%, which is higher than
17.41% in the credible bargaining model. As such, the Nash bargaining model seems to exhibit
even stronger nonlinear unemployment dynamics than the credible bargaining model.
Panel A of Table 9 reports the second moments of the labor market both in normal times and

We simulate 100,000 artiﬁcial samples from the Nash bargaining model’s stationary distribution, with 1,005
months in each sample. We split the samples into two groups: non-crisis samples (in which the maximum
unemployment rate is less than 20%) and crisis samples (in which the maximum rate is greater than or
equal to 20%). We take the quarterly averages of monthly U, V , and X to convert to quarterly series. We
implement the same procedure as in Panel A of Table 4, and report cross-simulation averages. We do so
conditionally on the non-crisis samples and on the crisis samples.

in crisis samples with b = 0.90. The unemployment volatility is 0.107 in normal times, which is not
far from 0.135 in the data. However, similar to the credible bargaining model, the volatility of labor
market tightness is 0.165, which falls short of 0.255 in the data. In the crisis samples, the unemployment volatility jumps up to 0.451, which is more than four times as large as that in normal times.
Unfortunately, the strong nonlinear dynamics in the Nash bargaining model hinge on the high
value of b = 0.90. From Panel B of Table 8, reducing b from 0.90 to only 0.85 lowers drastically the
percentage of crisis samples out of 100,000 simulations from 43.53% to 0.11%. Conditional on the
crisis samples, the persistence of the crisis state drops from 0.88 to 0.73, and the unconditional crisis
probability falls from 3.81% to 1.94%. Panel B of Table 9 shows further that with b = 0.85, the
unemployment volatility is only 0.022 in normal times, which is substantially lower than 0.135 in
the data. In untabulated results, we have also experimented with b = 0.71 as in Hall and Milgrom
(2008) and Pissarides (2009). With b = 0.71, the model does not exhibit any crisis dynamics (the

percentage of crisis samples out of 100,000 simulations is zero). Intuitively, a lower b increases the
ﬁrm’s proﬁts and makes wages more elastic. When employment falls in recessions, wages drop as
well, providing strong incentives of hiring. As such, crisis dynamics are dampened. Because a value
of b = 0.85 is high relative to 0.71, we conclude that the Nash wage model with the small surplus
calibration fails to provide a realistic microfoundation for unemployment crises.
Quantitative Results from the Fixed Matching Cost Calibration
We next ask whether the Nash bargaining model with a high ﬁxed matching cost can explain the
crisis dynamics of unemployment in the data. Panel A of Table 10 shows that this objective can
be achieved when we push the ﬁxed cost parameter, κ1 , to a high value of 3.1, while keeping the
proportional cost parameter, κ0 , to be a low value of 0.05. The persistence of the crisis state in
the model is 0.88, and its unconditional probability is 2.61%, both of which are close to those in
the data. The percentage of crisis samples out of 100,000 simulations is 2.36%, which is not (very)
close to zero. Panel A of Table 11 shows that the high ﬁxed cost calibration also manages to ﬁt the
ﬁrst two moments of unemployment in normal times. The mean of unemployment is 5.79%, and
its standard deviation is 9.8% in the non-crisis state of the model.

A natural question is whether the high ﬁxed cost calibration is empirically plausible. With
κ0 = 0.05 and κ1 = 3.1, the marginal cost of hiring is on average 3.29, which is the average of
κ0 /q(θ t ) + κ1 in simulations. Merz and Yashiv (2007) estimate the marginal cost of hiring in the
data to be 1.48 (in terms of the average output per worker) with a standard error of 0.57. As such,
3.29 is too high because it is more than three standard errors from the empirical estimate of 1.48.
Panel B of Table 10 conducts a comparative static experiment when we vary κ1 to 2.75. The
marginal cost of hiring reduces to 3.10 in the model, which is still more than two standard errors
from the empirical estimate of 1.48. Even with this extremely high ﬁxed cost, the percentage of
crisis samples in 100,000 simulations drops to only 0.12%. Conditional on a crisis sample, the
persistence of the crisis state reduces to 0.75, and its unconditional probability to 0.94%. Panel
B of Table 11 also shows that the unemployment volatility falls to 5.9% in the non-crisis sample,
although the volatility of labor market tightness remains high, 25.2%. In untabulated results, we
39

have also experimented with κ1 = 2.5. The marginal cost of hiring is 3.02 in the model, which is
still outside the two-standard-error bound of the empirical estimate. The model does not exhibit
any crisis dynamics (the number of crisis samples out of 100,000 simulations is zero). As such,
we conclude that the Nash bargaining model with the ﬁxed cost calibration also fails to provide a
realistic explanation of the crisis dynamics of unemployment in the U.S. data.

Conclusion

A search and matching model, when calibrated to the mean and volatility of unemployment in
the postwar sample, can potentially explain the crisis dynamics of unemployment in the Great
Depression. The key ingredient of the model is the Hall and Milgrom (2008) credible bargaining
game for determinating the equilibrium wage. The limited impact of labor market conditions on
the wage from credible bargaining and the congestion externality from matching frictions cause the
unemployment rate to rise sharply in recessions but decline gradually in booms. The frequency,
severity, and persistence of unemployment crises in the model are quantitatively consistent with
U.S. historical time series from April 1929 to December 2012.
