Taking the Measure of a Fatal Drug Epidemic

NBER Working Paper No. 22504

JEL No. I10,I12,I18
ABSTRACT
This analysis utilizes death certificate data from the Multiple Cause of Death (MCOD) files to
better measure the specific drugs involved in drug poisoning fatalities. Statistical adjustment
procedures are used to provide more accurate estimates, accounting for the understatement in
death certificate reports resulting because no drug is specified in between one-fifth and onequarter of cases. The adjustment procedures typically raise the estimates of specific types of drug
involvement by 30% to 50% and emphasize the importance of the simultaneous use of multiple
categories of drugs. Using these adjusted estimates, an analysis is next provided of drugs
accounting for the rapid increase over time in fatal overdoses. The frequency of combination drug
use introduces uncertainty into these estimates and so a distinction is made between any versus
exclusive involvement of specific drug types. Many of the results are sensitive to the starting and
ending years chosen for examination, with a key role of prescription opioids for analysis windows
starting in 1999 but with other drugs, particularly heroin deaths, becoming more significant in
more recent years and, again, with confirmatory evidence of the importance of simultaneous drug
use.

The poisoning death rate roughly tripled over the last three decades, with about 90% of
these fatalities now caused by drugs (Warner et al., 2011). At least 80% of poisoning mortality
was accidental in 2011 and this is now the leading cause of injury deaths (Chen et al., 2014).
Increased rates of poisoning deaths are the most important reason for the striking result that the
all-cause mortality rates of 45-54 year old non-Hispanic whites increased by around 0.5% per
year between 1999 and 2013 (Case & Deaton, 2015). The involvement of prescription opioid
analgesics, such as oxycodone, methadone and hydrocodone has received particular attention
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011, 2012; Volkow et al, 2014), including a White
House Summit specifically addressing the problem in August 2014 (Hardesty, 2014). However,
fatal drug poisonings are not limited to opioids. Sedatives and psychotropic drugs are frequently
mentioned on death certificates and combination drug use is common (Jones et al., 2013;
Paulozzi et al., 2014), with heroin-related overdoses recently emerging as a major killer (Jones et
al., 2015; Rudd et al., 2016).
The rapid rise in fatal drug poisonings justifies the concerted efforts undertaken to reduce
the negative consequences of the prescription drug epidemic such as: establishing prescription
drug monitoring programs, restricting the ability of pain clinics and online pharmacies to
dispense oxycodone and other controlled substances; and developing abuse-deterrent
formulations of some prescription drugs (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013;
Finklea, et al., 2013; Rannazzisi, 2013; Kirschner et al., 2014).
These endeavors have been partially successful. Drug poisoning deaths in Florida
decreased 17% between 2010 and 2013, with a 52% decline in fatal oxycodone overdoses,
following aggressive efforts to reverse the proliferation of pain clinics, prohibit the dispensing of
schedule II or III drugs from physician offices, and other measures (Johnson, et al., 2014).

Deaths involving methadone peaked in 2007 and have since declined along with a fall in the
amount of methadone distributed nationally (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012).
However, the accomplishments are incomplete. After Florida’s crackdown, some pain clinic
owners moved out of the state or found ways to circumvent the laws, and there are questions
whether prescription drug monitoring programs have reduced deadly overdoses (Paulozzi, et al.,
2011; Gugelmann et al., 2011; Li et al., 2014). Most notably, some users may have substituted
heroin for prescription opioids, with a more than tripling in the rate of heroin-related deaths
between 2010 and 2014 (Rudd et al., 2016).
There are several barriers to formulating the most effective policies to deter dangerous
use of prescription pharmaceuticals while avoiding the potential substitution to other harmful
legal or illegal drugs. Importantly, we do not currently have reliable information on the specific
drugs involved in poisoning fatalities because at least one of the drugs involved is unspecified on
the death certificates of approximately half of fatal overdose deaths, and no specific drug is
mentioned in between one-fifth and one-quarter of cases (depending on the year). This leads to
an underestimate of the rates of involvement of specific legal and elicit drugs, as well as of the
simultaneous use of drug combinations. Sedatives (particularly benzodiazepines) and
psychotropic drugs are increasingly frequently mentioned on death certificates (Paulozzi, et al.,
2014) and the use of these drugs alongside prescription opioids is likely to increase health risks
beyond the separate consumption of either (Jones et al., 2012).
Economists have widely studied risky behaviors in general and substance abuse in
particular (see Cawley & Ruhm, 2012 for a detailed summary of this literature), but there has
been little investigation of the rapid rise in fatal overdoses, the role of specific drugs in
contributing to it, or of policies designed to reverse or slow the increase. An important exception

Page 3

is Meinhofer’s (2015) analysis showing that the supply-side intervention in Florida, starting in
2010 and briefly described above, increased oxycodone street prices, reduced their supply and
decreased related consumption, hospitalizations and deaths, while leading to limited increases in
heroin use. Others include Jena & Goldman’s (2011) evidence that the growth in internet
pharmacies between 2000 and 2007 may have contributed to rising rates of prescription drug
abuse, Pacula et al.’s (2015) findings that the introduction of the Medicare Part D in 2006 may
have similar had effects for the 65+ population, as well as for younger persons not directly
affected by the program, Ruhm’s (2015) demonstration that poisoning fatalities shifted over time
from being procyclical to countercyclical during the period of rapid growing drug poisoning
deaths, and Carpenter et al.’s (2016) indication of a procyclical variation in disorders related to
the use of analgesics during the 2002-2013 period.
The analysis below uses death certificate data from the Multiple Cause of Death (MCOD)
files for 1999-2014 to examine the specific drugs involved in fatal drug poisonings. The
investigation is innovative in at least two ways. First, the statistical adjustment procedures
applied here provide more accurate estimates of the drugs involved in these deaths, accounting
for the understatement resulting from lack of specificity in death certificate reports. 1 These
methods raise the prevalence estimates of specific categories of drug involvement by 30% to
more than 50% and highlight the frequency of combination drug use. Second, using the adjusted
estimates, I attempt to determine which drugs are responsible for the rapid rise in fatal overdoses.
The frequency of multiple drug-taking introduces uncertainty into these estimates and so a
distinction is made between any versus exclusive involvement of drug classes in the deaths. This
investigation highlights the sensitivity of some findings to the choice of starting and ending
years, a key role of prescription opioids for analysis windows starting early in the data period but

poisoning deaths.
1. Data and Descriptive Patterns
The primary outcomes analyzed are counts of drug poisoning deaths using data from the
1999 through 2014 MCOD files. The MCOD data, available from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015), provide information
from death certificates on: a single underlying cause of death, up to twenty additional causes, and
limited demographic data. The cause-of-death information are categorized using four digit
International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes with details also
provided on place of residence, age, race/ethnicity, gender, year, and weekday of death. The
public use files lack geographic identifiers; however, information on the state and county of
residence are available under restricted conditions and were obtained for use in this study. 2
Poisoning and drug poisoning deaths are defined using ICD-10 underlying cause of death
codes, where the where the underlying cause is the “disease or injury that initiated the chain of
morbid events that led directly and inevitably to death” (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2014). 3 In cases of drug poisoning, the death certificate lists one or more drugs
involved as immediate or contributory causes of death. These are included separately as ICD-10
“T codes” and are referred to below as drug mentions or involvement. Specific drug categories to
be examined include: narcotics, sedatives, psychotropics, other specified drugs and unspecified
drugs. Important subcategories are also be analyzed. Narcotics are decomposed into
(prescription) opioid analgesics, heroin, cocaine and other narcotics; opioid analgesics into

2

The analysis is restricted to include of U.S. residents (i.e. foreign residents dying in the U.S. are excluded).
Poisoning deaths include ICD-10 codes X40-X49, X60-X69, X85-X90 Y10-Y19, Y35.2, *U01(.6-.7); codes for
drug poisoning deaths are X40-X44, X60-X64, X85, Y10-Y14, Y35.2, *U01.6, *U01..7 (World Health
Organization, 2014).

methadone and other opioid analgesics. Benzodiazepines will sometimes be broken out as an
important subclass of sedatives. Among psychotropics, antidepressants, antipsychotics and
stimulants will be separately examined. “Other specified” drugs include a wide variety of
medications including anesthetics, antiallergic and immunosuppressive drugs, histamine and
anti-gastric secretion medications, cardiac drugs, antibiotics and many others. Poisoning by
unspecified drugs, medicaments and biologicals (ICD-10 code, T50.9) is important because no
specific drug is identified for approximately one-quarter of drug poisoning deaths and this code
is mentioned in around half of cases. Combination drug use will be examined through a variable
indicating mentions of two or more of the following drug categories: opioid analgesics, heroin,
cocaine other narcotics, sedatives, psychotropics or other drugs. This classification somewhat
understates the frequency of poly-drug use since it does not capture the use of multiple types of
drugs within classes. 4
The main analysis begins in 1999 because ICD-9 codes, used prior to that year, are not
fully comparable to ICD-10 categories (Anderson et al., 2001). However, corresponding
frequencies of the broad categories of poisoning and drug poisoning deaths (but not types of
drugs involved) can be obtained using ICD-9 codes and so public-use MCOD files for years
before 1999 are used to conduct a descriptive investigation examining broad trends in poisoning
deaths from 1982 to 2014.
1.1 Trends in Poisoning Deaths
Poisoning fatalities rose 360% between 1982 and 2014, from 11,297 to 51,966 deaths,
and drug poisoning mortality by an even larger 622%, from 6,518 to 47,055 (see the top panel of
Figure 1). In 1982, there were four times more motor vehicle deaths than poisoning fatalities and

4

Psychotropics may be most important in this regard, since this category includes heterogeneous types of drugs.

Page 6

seven times more than deadly drug overdoses. 5 Conversely, in 2014, there were 33% more drug
poisoning deaths than vehicle fatalities, with drug overdoses being responsible for 91% of all
poisoning deaths. Importantly, most of this change occurred since 1999 (75% of the rise in fatal
overdoses occurring between 1982 and 2014), so that the analysis period covers most of the
secular increase. Although population growth accounts for a portion of the increase, the
poisoning death rate rose by 234% between 1982 and 2014 (from 4.88 to 16.30 per 100,000) and
the drug poisoning mortality rate by 425% (from 2.81 to 14.75 per 100,000). 6
Figure 2 supplies information on the demographic distribution of drug poisoning deaths.
Several patterns are worth noting. First, males have higher death rats from this source than
females and the difference has become more pronounced over time (19% higher in 1982 versus
63% greater in 2014). Second, whites had higher fatal drug poisoning rates than blacks, but this
pattern has only emerged since 2000; other races have consistently lower mortality rates. 7
Finally, drug poisoning deaths are almost nonexistent for persons under the age of 15 with 25-54
year olds now at highest risk, and with the fastest growth over time for 45-64 year olds.
Geographic variations in drug poisoning death rates at the end of the analysis period are
displayed in Figure 3. The top figure shows state mortality rates for 2014, and the lower one
three-year averages of county death rates for 2012-2014, for counties with populations averaging
5,000 persons or more. 8 At the state level, drug mortality is relatively low in the West North

5

I often use the term “overdoses” to refer to drug poisoning deaths for convenience, while recognizing that some of
these deaths are intentional.
6
Population data (the denominator in the mortality rate calculations) come from the National Cancer Institute’s
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and are designed to supply more accurate population
estimates for intercensal years than standard census projections. See http://www.seer.cancer.gov/data for additional
details.
7
Data on Hispanics, available since 1990, indicates that they generally have death rates below those of blacks but
higher than non-Hispanics who are neither black nor white.
8
Death rates are not displayed for counties with populations below 5,000 because the small sizes imply that such
estimates will be variable and unreliable. The thresholds on the maps refer to population-weighted minimum, 25th,
50th, 75th and 90th percentiles, and maximum drug poisoning rates per 100,000.

Central region and much of the South, with the exceptions of Oklahoma and Louisiana, while
being high in Alaska, most of the Mountain and Appalachian states (except Idaho), the rust belt
and parts of New England. The picture is somewhat more nuanced when looking at counties,
with continuing very high mortality risk in the South West, Appalachia and rust-belt but also
with pockets of high mortality in otherwise relatively low drug death states such as California
and Texas.
1.2 Death Certificate Reports in 2014
Table 1 shows death certificate reports of drug mentions and the manner of death
(accidental, intentional, undetermined intent or homicide) for all drug poisonings occurring in
2014 (the last year of the analysis period), with corresponding ICD-10 codes (ChiroCode
Institute, 2014) shown in parentheses. Numbers and percentages of deaths were calculated for all
drug poisonings and by manner of death and type of drug (as well as alcohol mentions), with the
shares referred to as prevalences below. I also show exclusive involvement of major class of
drugs, defined as deaths where only a single specified class of drugs is mentioned on the death
certificate (although unspecified drugs could also be reported), as well as cases where two or
more major drug classes are identified.
More than four-fifths (82%) of drug poisonings in 2014 were classified as accidental,
with fewer than one in eight categorized as intentional. Narcotics were mentioned in 65% of fatal
overdoses, with reported prevalences of 40%, 23% and 12% for opioid analgesics, heroin and
cocaine. However, involvement of other drugs is also common with sedatives and psychotropic
drugs each listed in around one-fifth of fatal overdoses. Alcohol is mentioned in less than onetenth of fatal drug poisonings. Most germane to this analysis, only unspecified drugs are listed in
20% of deaths. The percentage of fatal overdoses with at least one drug specified ranges across

Page 8

years from a low of 74.1% in 2008 to a high of 80.4% in 2014 (see Figure 4), with the smallest
specification rates occurring during the great recession (2007-2009) and its aftermath, and rapid
increases at the end of the sample period. For this reason, reported rates of drug involvement will
understate the true prevalences for most drugs and may yield a misleading understanding of the
nature of the fatal drug epidemic. A primary effort below is to assign reasonable attribution to
specified drug types in as many of these deaths as possible.
Figure 5 displays the variation in county-level drug specification rates averaged over the
2012-2014 period for counties with at least 5,000 residents and a positive number of fatal drug
overdoses. The figure shows some similarity with the corresponding map of drug poisoning rates
(Figure 3b) raising the possibility that some geographic differences in drug poisoning mortality
reflects differences in reporting patterns.
Also noteworthy is the frequency (34%) with which multiple drug classes are mentioned.
One implication is that it may be hard to assign the responsibility of the death to any specific
drug category. 9 For example, prescription opioid use was reported in 40% of drug poisoning
deaths, but these were the only class of drugs mentioned in just 17%. Exclusive involvement of
other drug types was reported only one-fifth to one-half as often as any use in most cases, except
that sedatives were almost never the only drug class reported. In less than 1% of drug poisonings,
no drug (even an unspecified one) was listed. While it would presumably be reasonable to add
these to the exclusively unspecified category, this has not been done in the adjustment
procedures below, possibly resulting in a slight continued understatement of the prevalences of
specific drugs. 10

9

The prevalence of deaths involving multiple drugs rises to 38.7% when the combination drug use measure is
expanded to include alcohol.
10
There could also be some misclassification of underlying causes of death whereby fatalities not categorized as
being due to drug poisonings actually involved them and vice versa. The solution to this problem is not obvious

Page 9

2. Methods
A primary goal of this analysis is to calculate adjusted prevalences that account for drug
poisoning deaths where the death certificates include unspecified drug classes. Towards this end,
a dichotomous variable was constructed indicating if at least one specific drug was mentioned on
the death certificate, rather than only the unspecified category. County-year averages of this
variable were calculated and denoted as 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌. For an initial descriptive analysis, counties

were classified as “low diagnosis” if a specific drug was mentioned in fewer than 68.4% of drug
poisoning deaths in 2014 and “high diagnosis” if this was done in more than 98.2% of cases.
These thresholds reflect the 25th and 75th percentiles of 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 in 2014. Drug mention

prevalences were then compared across high and low diagnosis counties to provide a first
indication of how reported prevalences were affected by the frequent failure to identify the drugs

involved in fatal overdoses. 11 Such comparisons are not fully informative, since high and low
diagnosis states could differ along other dimensions.
To control for potential confounding factors, a series of probit models were separately
estimated for each year. The basic model takes the form:
(1)

𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌𝑗𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗𝑡 ,

where 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑡 is a binary dependent variable indicating if the death for individual i in county j and

year t is reported to involve the specified drug. 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌, the explanatory variable of primary

interest, measures the county-year drug specification rate. The models also include

supplementary covariates (𝑋) for: gender, two race indicators (black and other nonwhite),
currently married (versus never married, separated/divorced, widowed, or status not reported),
(particularly since the information on drug involvement is less detailed for most deaths categorized not due to
poisoning); however, it is possible to examine reported drug involvement in “non-drug” poisoning deaths. In 2014,
there were 4,911 non-drug poisoning fatalities. A drug was mentioned on the death certificate in 236 (4.8%) cases,
with most of these (118) being an unspecified drug and with a specific drug reported just 2.9% of the time (143
deaths), including opioid analgesic, sedative and psychotropic prevalences of 0.9%, 0.6% and 0.8% respectively.
11
Average values of SPECIFY are 46.0% in low diagnosis and 99.4% in high diagnosis counties.

four educational categories (less than high school graduate, high school graduate, some college,
college graduate), eight age categories (≤20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, >80, with
missing age as the reference group), nine census regions (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East
North Central, West North Central, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central,
Mountain and Pacific), and seven day of the week indicators. A complicating issue is that
education were sometimes reported in years rather than specific thresholds. In these cases, ≤11,
12, 13-15 and ≥16 years were classified as less than high school graduate, high school graduate,
some college and college graduate. 𝜇 is the regression error term.

Predicted values of the dependent variable were calculated, for each drug poisoning

death, and averaged over all observations to obtain estimated prevalences. Specifically, the
average predicted prevalence, 𝑃�𝑗𝑡 , for drug type j at time t, is:
1
𝑃�𝑗𝑡 = 𝑛 ∑𝑛𝑖=1 Φ�𝑌�𝑖𝑗𝑡 � =

(2)

1

𝑛

∑𝑛𝑖=1 Φ�𝛼� + 𝛽̂ 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑦𝑗𝑡 + 𝛾� 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 � ,

where Φ(.) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Since
these predictions are based on actual values of the explanatory variables, the estimated
prevalences are expected to be very close to the sample mean values. This was tested for and
confirmed.
A second set of predicted values were next obtained after setting 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 to one for all

observations. The average expected value, hereafter referred to as the “adjusted prevalence”, 𝑃�𝑗𝑡 ,

was estimated as:
(3)

𝑃�𝑗𝑡 =

1

𝑛

∑𝑛𝑖=1 Φ�𝛼� + 𝛽̂ + 𝛾� 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 � ,

and indicates the predicted drug involvement rate if at least one drug had been specified on all
drug overdose death certificates. Robust standard errors and the associated ninety-five percent
confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated with observations clustered by county. The

Page 11

�𝑗𝑡 , was calculated as the
predicted number of deaths involving the specified class of drugs, 𝐷
product of the adjusted prevalence and number of drug poisoning deaths in year t, 𝐷𝑡 , or:
�𝑗𝑡 = 𝑃�𝑗𝑡 × 𝐷𝑡 .
𝐷

(4)

Corresponding prevalence estimates of exclusive drug mentions (e.g. opioid analgesic
involvement without mention of heroin, cocaine, sedatives, psychotropics or other drugs) were
also calculated. In addition, I test and report results controlling for alternative sets of covariates
or estimating linear probability rather than probit specifications.
These represent “in-sample” estimates but two indications of the success of the
adjustment procedures were examined. The first compared reported and adjusted prevalences of
exclusive unspecified drug mentions (i.e. those where no drug is specified on the death
certificate). As mentioned, the reported prevalence was approximately 25% in most years.
Completely successful adjustment procedures would reduce this to zero, and the closer this is to
being achieved, the greater the confidence in the adjustment procedure. The second test was the
reverse of the first. Here, adjusted prevalences were calculated using the procedure above but
assuming that drug types were never specified on the death certificates (i.e. by setting by
predicting prevalence after setting 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 to zero). 12 Perfect adjustment implies that exclusive
mentions of unspecified drugs would occur in 100% of fatal overdoses. Note that when using a
probit model, predicted probabilities can never reach either zero or one, so that complete
adjustment is not possible.
I also use the adjusted prevalences to indicate the contributions of specific drug types to
the growth over time in fatal overdoses. Following the notation above, changes in prevalences
between an earlier and a later period, denoted by 𝑡 = 0 and 𝑡 = 1, are:
12

Thus, the estimated prevalence in this case is: 𝑃�𝑗𝑡 =

1

𝑛

∑𝑛𝑖=1 Φ�𝛼� + 𝛾� 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 � .

Page 12

∆𝑃�𝑗 = 𝑃�𝑗1 − 𝑃�𝑗0 ,

(5)

and the change in deaths involving the drug is:
(6)

�𝑗1 − 𝐷
�𝑗0 = 𝐷
�𝑗1 ∆𝑃�𝑗 + 𝑃�𝑗0 ∆𝐷,
�𝑗 = 𝐷
∆𝐷

where ∆𝐷 = 𝐷1 − 𝐷0 . Notice that (6) depends on changes in both prevalences and the total

number of drug deaths occurring between the two periods. Finally, the percentage of the change
�𝑗 /∆𝐷} × 100%.
in drug deaths that involves drug type j is: {∆𝐷

These calculations are conducted using prevalence estimates for both any and exclusive

mentions. Previous investigations often focus on any mentions of a class of drugs and so
correspond to the first set of estimates, except without adjusting the prevalences to account for
cases where only unspecified drugs are mentioned on the death certificates. Such estimates
almost certainly overstate the contribution of any specific drug class since combinations of drugs
types are common and result in double-counting. The calculations based on exclusive
prevalences address this but will conversely be understated since no attribution is made when
multiple drugs contribute to the deaths.
Examining changes in drug poisoning deaths over the 1999-2014 period is dictated by the
availability of comparable estimates of drug involvement using ICD-10 codes. Using the just
described methods, two related strategies are implemented to determine whether the results are
sensitive to the choice of starting of ending years. In the first, the starting year is always 1999
and the contributions to drug poisoning deaths are investigated for all possible ending years
between 2003 and 2014. 13 The second strategy is the reverse of the first, with the always being
2014 and the initial analysis year ranges between 1999 and 2010.
3. Drug Poisoning Deaths in 2014

13

Earlier ending periods are not examined since in short sample periods the estimates will be dominated by noise.

Page 13

A first indication of the extent to which death certificates understate the prevalence of
specific drug involvement in 2014 fatal drug poisonings was obtained by comparing the reported
rates in low and high diagnosis counties, defined as those where 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 was ≤68.4% and
≥98.2% respectively (see Table 2). Differences in reported prevalences are dramatic. For

example, opioid analgesics are mentioned 2.7 times as often in high versus low diagnosis
counties (52.8% vs. 19.5%), with even larger relative differences for heroin, cocaine, and
sedative mentions, and with the use of multiple drugs reported almost four times as frequently. 14
Particularly noteworthy is that only unspecified drugs are listed in 54% of fatal overdoses in low
diagnosis areas compared to less than 1% of those in high diagnosis counties. Interestingly,
combinations of specified and unspecified drug mentions are twice as common in the high
diagnosis locations, which also have greater numbers of conditions listed on the death
certificates. This comparison does not account for potential confounders, which could be
important since deaths in low diagnosis counties are more likely to involve females, whites and
married individuals (see Appendix Table A.1).
Table 3 displays reported and adjusted prevalences, with the latter obtained using the
procedures described above. The adjusted prevalences are higher for all specific drug classes,
implying that reported prevalences understate most types of drug involvement. For example, the
adjusted opioid analgesic prevalence was 52.6% or 31% higher than the reported 40.2%.
Adjusted prevalences of other major drug classes exceeded reported prevalences by 32% to 48%,
and the involvement of multiple drug classes rose from 34.4% to 49.3%. The lower panel of the
table shows corresponding results for exclusive drug mentions. The increases here are smaller
and more varied, but still important, ranging from 10% for psychotropics to 24% for heroin.

14

Alcohol is also mentioned much more frequently in the high diagnosis counties (11.7% vs. 4.2%).

Page 14

The adjustment procedures work well, but not perfectly. Specifically, the prevalence of
only unspecified drugs falls by more than four-fifths, from 19.6% to 3.5%, when using the
adjustment procedures. Adjusted prevalences were calculated using the same procedure but
under the assumption that drug types were never specified on the death certificates (by predicting
probabilities with 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 = 0). Here, perfect adjustment would imply predictions of exclusive
mentions of unspecified drugs in 100% of fatal overdoses, versus an actual estimate of 96.3%.
Thus, to the extent the adjustments remain incomplete, there is likely to be a small continuing
understatement of specific drug mentions.
I tested the robustness of the adjustment procedures to a variety of alternative
specifications including: 1) estimating linear probability rather than probit models; 2) excluding
all covariates other than 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌; 3) adding supplementary covariates for the manner of death

(dummy variables for intentional and accidental deaths, with undetermined deaths and homicides
as the reference group) and whether an autopsy was performed. The last specification could be
problematic if the determination of manner of death or the use of autopsies is endogenous (e.g. if
the latter are more commonly performed in high diagnosis counties). 15 However, Appendix
Table A.2 shows that the adjusted prevalence estimates are insensitive to any of these
alternatives. Particularly interesting is the similarity of the results of the specification without
any supplementary covariates to those in the main model. This implies that almost all of the
important variation captured is due to the cross-county variation in drug specification rates. The
findings might change when controlling for other information (not included death certificates)
but the similarity of results across specifications in the table makes this less likely.

15

Kapusta et al. (2011) provide cross-national evidence suggesting that autopsy use and rates of intentional deaths
(suicides) are positively related. A number of authors argue that drug poisoning deaths will frequently be classified
as accidental or of undetermined intent when they are really intentional (Rockett et al., 2014a,b). Information on
autopsies first became available on death certificates in 2003.

Page 15

The adjustments to this point correct for cases where no drug is specified on the death
certificate. However, prevalences could still be understated when using this procedure because it
does not account for cases where the death certificate lists both specified and unspecified drugs.
To investigate this possibility, I estimated the augmented model:
(7)

𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑆𝑂𝑀𝐸𝑗𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗𝑡 ,

where 𝑆𝑂𝑀𝐸 is a dummy variable taking the value of one if the death certificate lists both

specified and unspecified drugs and zero if only unspecified or specified drugs are reported.
Adjusted prevalences assuming that all death certificates included only specified drugs
(𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 = 1, 𝑆𝑂𝑀𝐸 = 0) were calculated as:
𝑃�𝑗𝑡 =

(8a)

1

𝑛

∑𝑛𝑖=1 Φ�𝛼� + 𝛽̂1 + 𝛾� 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 � ,

and those where all death certificates included mentions of both specified and unspecified drugs
(𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 = 1, 𝑆𝑂𝑀𝐸 = 1) as:
(8b)

𝑃�𝑗𝑡 =

1

𝑛

∑𝑛𝑖=1 Φ�𝛼� + 𝛽̂1 + 𝛽̂2 + 𝛾� 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 � .

The results of this exercise, displayed in Appendix Table A.3, yield almost uniformly
lower estimated prevalences assuming that only specified drugs are included on the death
certificates than when both specified and unspecified drugs are mentioned. The differences are
particularly large for multiple drug use (42% vs. 61%), sedatives (23% vs. 39%) and
psychotropic medications (23% vs. 34%), as well as for opioid analgesics (48% vs. 60%). The
only exception is heroin, where the adjusted prevalences are higher (33% vs. 26%).
One explanation for this pattern is that combinations of specified and unspecified drug
reports tend to occur when there are larger numbers of mentions on death certificates. Appendix
Table A.4 shows the results of regressing the number of conditions listed against county values
of 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 and 𝑆𝑂𝑀𝐸. As expected, the smallest number of drug mentions are predicted
Page 16

(1.67) when only unspecified drugs are reported (𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 = 0, 𝑆𝑂𝑀𝐸 = 0). However, the

predicted number of mentions is higher (4.26 vs. 3.40) when the death certificate includes both
specified and unspecified drugs (𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 = 1, 𝑆𝑂𝑀𝐸 = 1) than when it only includes the

former (𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 = 1, 𝑆𝑂𝑀𝐸 = 0). The gap between the two adjusted prevalences detailed in

Appendix Table A.3 is substantially reduced, although not completely eliminated, in regressions
(not shown) that additionally control for the number of conditions listed. This suggests that death
certificates with combinations of specified and unspecified drugs are filled out in greater detail,
with one result being that they have yield higher reported and adjusted prevalences of almost all
types of drugs. Consistent with this possibility, death certificates may specify the type of drug
involvement in one section, while reporting it as unspecified elsewhere. 16
The aforementioned discussion leaves open the possibility that the primary adjustment
procedures used in this analysis also yield downwards biased estimates because of incomplete
reporting of drug involvement, even in cases where at least one drug class is specified. It is not
obvious that this problem can be fully addressed but some indication of its severity was obtained
by adding to the main model an additional control for the county average number of conditions
listed on the death certificate, 𝑁𝑈𝑀𝐶𝑇𝑌. More precisely, the regression equation was:
(9)

𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑁𝑈𝑀𝐶𝑇𝑌𝑗𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜇𝑖𝑗𝑡 ,

and adjusted prevalences were calculated with 𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝐼𝐹𝑌 = 1 and 𝑁𝑈𝑀𝐶𝑇𝑌 = 4.264:
(10)

𝑃�𝑗𝑡 =

1

𝑛

∑𝑛𝑖=1 Φ�𝛼� + 𝛽̂1 + 4.286 𝛽̂2 + 𝛾� 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 � ,

where 4.264 is the predicted number of conditions mentioned in counties with both specified and
unspecified drug mentions. While not perfect, comparing these adjusted prevalences to those
16

Robert Anderson, Chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch of the National Center for Health Statistics, notes that
death certificates will often contain an unspecified listing such as “multi-drug toxicity” in the “cause-of-death”
section and then mention of one or more specific drugs (e.g. heroin) in the “other significant conditions contributing
to death” area (source: personal communications, October 2 and October 6, 2015).

Page 17

from the model without controls for 𝑁𝑈𝑀𝐶𝑇𝑌 provides some indication of the sensitivity of

estimated prevalences to the completeness of reporting. Table 4 summarizes the findings. Model
(1) shows estimates using the main adjustment procedure (from equation 3), with model (2)
displaying corresponding results using equation (8) and the last column indicating percentage
differences between the two.
Narcotics prevalences are relatively unaffected, whereas more complete listing of drug
involvement increases sedative prevalences more than 15% and those of other specified drugs or
combination drug use by 11% each, and psychotropic involvement by 8%. This implies is that
that the main adjustment procedures probably provide a fairly accurate indication of prescription
opioid, heroin and cocaine involvement but may understate the roles of other drug categories and
multiple drug use.
Table 5 returns to the primary adjustment procedure and shows differences in reported
and adjusted prevalences by manner of drug poisoning (accidental, intentional or undetermined
intent). 17 The key differences are that, compared to intentional deaths, accidental drug
poisonings are more likely to involve narcotics of all kinds with less common mentions of
sedatives, psychotropics, other specified or unspecified drugs. Fatal drug poisonings of
undetermined intent are usually intermediate between the two, although opioid analgesics are
mentioned particularly frequently.
Table 6 compares county-level drug poisoning deaths rates (per 100,000) involving
opioid analgesics or heroin, calculated using adjusted prevalences vs. those based on reported
prevalences, for the 250 largest counties. 18 The table also shows the opioid analgesic and heroininvolved death rates, based on adjusted prevalences. The metric focused upon is the change in

17
18

Since there were only 81 drug poisoning homicides in 2014, results for this manner of death are not shown.
The 250 counties have a minimum population of 267,618 and their average population is 787,060.

Page 18

the county ranking between death rates based on adjusted versus reported death rates, where a
lower ranking indicates a worse outcome. For instance, Baltimore City Maryland had the highest
reported rate of deaths involving opioid analgesics (26.8 per 100,000) and the second highest
number based on adjusted prevalences. Thus, the ranking based on adjusted prevalences was one
place better than based on reported prevalences (2 vs. 1). Large negative adjusted vs. reported
rank differences therefore show worse performance based on adjusted rather than reported
prevalences, with large positive rank differences indicated better performance. For instance, the
largest deterioration in rankings for opioid-analgesic involved deaths was for Philadelphia, PA,
which has the 226th (out of 250) highest death rate based on reported prevalences, but the 10th
largest based on reported prevalences, a deterioration of 216 places. By contrast, Kent, MI has
the largest improvement for opioid-involved death rates when comparing adjusted versus
reported prevalences, ranking 117th out of 250 based on the latter versus 213th using the former.
Philadelphia country provides a striking example of the change from using adjusted,
rather than reported, prevalences to calculate death rates. It has 226th highest opioid analgesicinvolved rate of drug poisoning deaths (out of the 250 largest counties) based on death certificate
reports, but the 10th highest rate when computed based on adjusted prevalences, the largest
deterioration found. Similarly, it has the second highest deterioration (from 222nd to 4th) in
heroin-involved overdose deaths. More generally, 9 (8) Pennsylvania counties are among the 20
with the worst deterioration in reported vs. adjusted rankings for opioid analgesic (heroin)
involved fatal drug poisonings, with 3 (3) in New Jersey and 4 (2) in Florida. These reflect the
relatively low diagnosis rates in these states, with the result that the number of deaths involving
specified drugs rises relatively substantially when using adjusted rather than reported

Page 19

prevalences. 19 Interestingly, the patterns for counties with the largest improvement in rankings
differ fairly sharply for opioid analgesic related deaths (3 counies each in New York and
California) as compared to those involving heroin (led by 6 counties in North Carolina, 5 in
Virginia). 20
4. Fatal Drug Poisonings: 1999-2014
Using the methods discussed above, I next compare reported and adjusted prevalences for
all sample years (1999 through 2014), as well as the corresponding numbers of deaths involving
specified classes of drugs. Adjusted prevalences are calculated as 𝑃�𝑗𝑡 , from equation (3), and the
�𝑗𝑡 from equation (4). Prevalences are displayed in Figure 6 and
number of deaths as 𝐷

corresponding numbers of deaths in Figure 7. In each case, the thin solid line shows results based
on death certificate reports, the bold solid line indicates the adjusted estimates and the dotted line
displays differences between the two. Adjusted prevalences and numbers of deaths exceed their
reported counterparts for all years and drug types, except for the undefined category.
Several points are noteworthy. Psychotropic and multiple drug prevalences rise fairly

steadily throughout the analysis period, as do sedative and opioid analgesic involvement through
2010 and 2011 (Figure 6). Cocaine prevalence decreases sharply until 2010, and then levels out,
while heroin involvement declines through 2006 but increases thereafter, and dramatically so
beginning in 2011. Since fatal overdoses rose rapidly over the sample period—from 16,849 in
1999 to 47,055 in 2014—deaths involving particular drugs could increase even with flat or
declining prevalences. For instance, the number of drug deaths with cocaine mentions increased
40% between 1999 and 2014 (from 5,076 to 7,131), even while the prevalence fell from 30% to

19

For example, county-level drug specification rates averaged 50.1%, 70.0% and 73.4% in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey and Florida in 2014.
20
Average county-level drug specification rates were 95.3%, 76.8%, 91.4% and 97.2% in New York, California,
North Carolina and Virginia.

Page 20

15% (see Figure 7). 21 On the other hand, rising prevalences reinforce this effect so that, for
example, deaths involving psychotropic drugs more than tripled (from 3,577 to 12,837) while the
prevalence rose “just” 28% (from 21.2% to 27.3%). The figures also highlight the recent
explosion of fatal heroin overdoses: the estimated number of deaths involving heroin rose 18%
(from 2,342 to 2,757) between 1999 and 2006, by an additional 53% (to 4,214) in 2010 and then
by another 235% (to 14,103) in 2014. Finally, while their growth has not been particularly rapid,
opioid analgesics remain the most common class of drugs involved in fatal drug poisonings, with
mentions estimated to rise from 5,390 in 1999 to 24,271 in 2011 and 24,769 in 2014.
Figure 8 shows percentage differences in adjusted and reported prevalences or numbers
of deaths across drug classes and over time. The upper panel shows the percentage differences in
each year and the lower figure shows differentials normalized such that the 1999 value equals
zero. Specifically, define the percentage difference between adjusted and reported prevalences
for drug class 𝑗 at time 𝑡 as:
(11)

∆𝑗𝑡 = {(𝑃�𝑗𝑡 �𝑃𝑗𝑡 ) − 1} × 100%,

where 𝑃𝑗𝑡 and 𝑃�𝑗𝑡 are reported and adjusted prevalences, the normalized difference is calculated as:

(12)

𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚
∆𝑗𝑡
= {(∆𝑗𝑡 ⁄∆𝑗1999 ) − 1} × 100%. 22

The top panel of Figure 8 demonstrates that death certificate reports understate
prevalences most severely for sedatives and combination drug use and, to a lesser extent, for
psychotropic medications. Relative differences between adjusted and reported prevalences have
grown most over time for heroin, other specified drugs and, to a smaller degree, for opioid
analgesics while remaining roughly constant for most other drug classes (see the lower panel).
An important consequence is that the rapid recent rise in heroin-related deaths has actually been
21

The number of cocaine involved deaths was estimated to reach a maximum of 10,133 in 2006.
Since the number of deaths involving the drug is the product of the prevalence and total number of deaths,
percentage differences in prevalences and numbers of deaths are the same.
22

Page 21

understated in death certificate reports. However, this may be less true for other drug types, since
the difference between actual and adjusted prevalences generally declines after 2010. This
reflects the higher rates of drug specification in recent years, an issue to which we return below.
Figure 9 shows absolute (rather than percentage) differences between adjusted and
reported prevalences (top panel) or numbers of deaths (bottom panel). Since these depend on the
absolute level of prevalences as well as relative (percentage) difference between adjusted and
reported rates, it is not surprising that the largest disparities occur for opioid analgesic and
multiple drug involvement (reaching 7,354 and 7,535 deaths respectively in 2011, before
declining to 5,876 and 6,996 in 2014), although the gaps are also substantial for sedatives and
psychotropic medications (5,351 and 3,528 deaths in 2011), as well as heroin in recent years
(3,529 fatalities in 2014).
5. Drug Combinations
Table 7 provides further information on the role of multiple drug use by showing
combinations of drugs involved in overdose deaths in 1999, 2006 and 2014 (the first, middle and
last analysis periods). Drug combinations are calculated using adjusted prevalences. 23 The table
shows percentages of cases where the drug listed in the first column is combined with the drug
types listed in the column headings, except for the last column which indicates shares of
exclusive drug use. For example, the first row shows that, in 1999, 13%, 18%, 18%, 21% and 5%
of opioid analgesic-related deaths also involved the use of heroin, cocaine, sedatives,
psychotropic medications and other specified drugs; with 43% involving no other specified drug
category. 24

23

The exceptions are for combinations of heroin use with sedatives, psychotropics and other medications in 1999
and with other drugs in 2006, where the reported prevalences are too low (0.5%, 0.6%, 0.2% and 0.1%) to estimate
adjusted prevalences.
24
These total to more than 100% because more than two drug categories are involved in some deaths.

Page 22

The table further emphasizes the role of drug “cocktails” in poisoning deaths. Exclusive
drug use occurs less than half the time for all categories and years, and is particularly rare for
sedatives in more recent years. However, the specific combinations of drugs involved varies
considerably across drug types and years. For instance, opioid analgesics were more commonly
combined with sedatives and psychotropics in 2014 than in 1999 or 2006, whereas simultaneous
use of cocaine became less frequent.
Patterns for heroin differ somewhat from those for other drug categories. Deaths
involving heroin have risen dramatically in recent years, as previously noted, with much of the
growth involving exclusive use – increasing from 39% and 40% in 1999 and 2006 to 45% in
2014. Conversely, the share of heroin-related deaths involving the combined use of opioid
analgesics fell from 30% in 1999 to 22% in 2006, and with a sharp recent reduction in the
fraction that also involve cocaine (from 32% in 1999 and 38% in 2006 to 20% in 2014). 25 On the
other hand, combinations of heroin with sedative or psychotropic medications have become
much more frequent.
6. Errors Due to Changes Over Time in Drug Specification Rates
As mentioned, the fraction of overdose deaths with a specific drug identified varies over
the analysis period between 74.1% and 80.4%. This introduces additional error in measures of
changes in drug involvement when using death certificate reports. Table 8 illustrates this issue by
calculating changes in specific drug involvement for overdose fatalities in 2012-2014 versus
those in 2011, using information directly from death certificates and the more correct estimates
obtained based on adjusted prevalences. This period is chosen because SPECIFY rose fairly
sharply over this it – from 74.7% in 2011 to 80.4% in 2014.
25

This reflects the very rapid rise in heroin-related deaths during a period where cocaine-involved fatalities were
initially falling and then fairly stable. Note that the percentage of cocaine-involved deaths where heroin was also
implicated rose from 15% in 1999 and 10% in 2006 to 41% in 2014.

Page 23

While the higher specification rate is desirable in principle, it results in an overstatement
of the increases (or an underestimate of decreases) in most types of drug involvement when
using death certificate reports. For example, using data from death certificates, 1,976 additional
drug poisoning deaths involved prescription opioids in 2014 than in 2011, a rise of nearly 12%.
However, much of this was due to higher rates of drug identification in the later year, rather than
an actual increase. Based on adjusted prevalence the growth was, at most, one-fourth as large
(498 deaths or 2.1%). The overstatement is similarly dramatic for sedatives. By contrast, the
increases are so dramatic for heroin that the error, while still large in absolute terms (141% vs.
129%) does not change the overall conclusions.
7. Drugs Responsible for the Increase in Fatal Overdoses
Considerable attention has been paid to the role of opioid analgesics as the contributor to
fatal drug poisonings, with large fractions of both deaths at a point in time and of the increases in
mortality over time involving mentions of these drugs. (e.g. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2013). However, the role of specific drug classes is complicated by the frequent, and
increasing prevalence in combination drug use. These issues are examined below by first
decomposing the increase in drug poisoning deaths occurring between 1999 and 2014 into the
fractions involving any or exclusive mentions of the various drug classes and second, by the
sensitivity of the results to changes in the starting and ending analysis years.
Results of the first phase of the analysis are summarized in Table 9, with additional
details in Appendix Table A.5. To illustrate the methods, there were 16,894 fatal drug poisonings
in 1999 and 47,055 in 2014, a growth of 30,206. Opioid analgesics were mentioned in 4,030 of
these deaths in 1999 and 18,893 in 2014, an increase of 14,863. Thus, based on death certificates,
opioid analgesics were “responsible” for 49.2% (14,863/30,206) of the rise in fatal overdoses.

Page 24

However, there are two reasons why such a conclusion may be incorrect. First, death
certificates understate opioid analgesic prevalence, as highlighted above. Specifically, based on
adjusted (rather than reported) prevalences, the point estimates indicate that prescription opioids
were involved in 5,390 deaths in 1999 and 24,769 in 2014, an increase of 19,380, which
corresponds to 64.2% (19,380/30,206) of the total growth in fatal overdoses. 26 Second, this
method attributes to opioid analgesics all of the growth in deaths that involve them in some way.
This is likely to be an overstatement because multiple drug classes are often implicated, implying
that summing the contributions, measured in this way, across drug classes will total to more than
100%. The lower panels of Tables 9 and A.5 therefore focus on exclusive involvements. For
example, based on adjusted prevalences, 2,300 drug poisoning deaths involved only opioid
analgesics in 1999 and 9,099 in 2014, an increase of 6,800 or 22.5% (6,800/30,206) of the total.
Thus, we can be reasonably confident that opioid analgesics were responsible for between 23%
and 64% of the rise in fatal overdoses occurring between 1999 and 2014 but, without knowing
how to assign responsibility in cases of multiple drug use, can say little more. 27
Based on any mentions, opioid analgesics play the most important role in accounting for
the rise in drug fatalities (64%). Even with the adjustment procedures, unspecified drugs explain
40% of the growth in deaths (reduced from 49% based on death certificate reports). Heroin,
sedatives (mostly benzodiazepines) and psychotropic drugs (especially antidepressants and
psychostimulants) each explain 31% to 39% of the trend, with less substantial roles for other
specified drugs, cocaine and other narcotics.

26

These estimates are based on adjusted prevalences of 32.0% in 1999 and 52.6% in 2014 (0.31989 x 16,849 =
5,390; 0.52639 x 47,055 = 24,769).
27
Actually, the bounds are even wider. Taking the 95% confidence intervals into account, the range might be as
large as 20% to 67%.

Page 25

Corresponding calculations using exclusive mentions reveal much lower contributions
but also some important differences in the patterns. Opioid analgesics continue to contribute the
most (23%) but not that much more than heroin (18%). Conversely, use of sedatives explains
almost none of the growth in fatal overdoses because these are almost never the only type of
drug involved, but lone use of psychotropics plays a relatively important role – accounting for
7% of the increase –mostly due to psychostimulants.
A key result, reiterated in the last row of the tables, is that drug “cocktails” account for
55% of the rise in deaths, again emphasizing the importance of understanding the role of
individual drug classes in these cases or of the higher risks implied by the use of multiple drugs.
A possible exception is that exclusive deadly use appears to be relatively common for heroin. For
instance, in 2014, 45% of fatal drug overdoses involving heroin (6,292 of 14,103) were
characterized by exclusive use, compared to 37%, 7%, and 29% of opioid analgesic, sedative and
psychotropic cases. 28
Examination of the 1999-2014 period reflects the availability of comparable data rather
than any theoretical justification. The remainder of this section considers the sensitivity of the
results to the use of alternative analysis windows. Figure 10 summarizes estimated effects for
periods that start in 1999 and end in the year specified on the X-axis. For instance, the left-most
entry is for 1999-2003 while that farthest to the right covers the full 1999-2014 period (and so
provides equivalent information to Table 9). 29
Opioids analgesic mentions are most important for all sub-periods but have become
somewhat less so for those that include the most recent years: any prescription opioid
involvement “explains” 74% to 85% of the growth in deaths for periods ending between 2003
28

Exclusive use also has fairly high proportions of total mentions for psychostimulants (44%), although the overall
contributions are smaller for these because of their relatively low prevalences.
29
Windows shorter than 4 years are dominated by noise and so are not shown here or on Figure 11.

Page 26

and 2010, but the share rapidly declines for later ending years, to 63% for 1999-2013 and 64%
for the full period. Conversely, role of exclusive opioid analgesic mentions falls virtually
monotonically with the addition of later years, from 40% for 1999-2003 to 23% for 1999-2014.
This occurs because the contribution of deaths involving combinations of drugs rises fairly
steadily with the addition of recent years, from 42% for 1999-2003 to 56% for 1999-2014.
The other notable results in Figure 10 relate to the role of illicit opioids, with a declining
role for cocaine initially and a rising contribution of heroin in later ending years. Specifically,
cocaine involvement “explained” 21% to 29% of the rise in overdose deaths for periods starting
in 1999 and ending between 2003 and 2007, with exclusive mentions accounting for 10% to
14%. However, cocaine-related deaths played almost no role in the overall change when the
sample includes ending years of 2009 or later. By contrast, changes in heroin-related fatalities
had little explanatory power for periods ending prior to 2007 – accounting for 0% to 3% of the
total change – but became more consequential with the inclusion of subsequent years,
particularly those after 2010. Specifically, any heroin mentions accounted for 9%, 15%, 24%,
32%, and 39% of the total change for analysis windows ending in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and
2014, with exclusive mentions being responsible for 6%, 9%, 14%, 17%, and 18%. Results for
the other drug classes are less sensitive to the choice of time periods, except for the continued
rise in the explanatory power of sedative involvement when including recent years. However, as
mentioned the sedatives are almost never exclusively responsible for drug poisoning deaths.
Figure 11 summarizes an alternative way of examining the data where the ending year is
always 2014 but the starting year varies. Doing so yields remarkable changes. In particular, any
mentions of opioid analgesics play a dominant role for analysis with early starting dates but
account for less of the growth in overdose deaths than heroin when the first year analyzed is

Page 27

2004 or later, and also for sedatives and psychotropics when it is after 2005 and 2006
respectively. Conversely, heroin-involved deaths make the largest contribution when the
beginning year is subsequent to 2003 and exclusive heroin mentions explain more of the growth
in fatal overdoses than corresponding involvement of opioid analgesics for all periods starting
after 2001: any heroin involvement accounts for 60%, 97% and 113% percent of the rise in drug
deaths for analysis windows starting in 2004, 2007 and 2010 with exclusive heroin involvement
responsible for 26%, 43% and 47% of the increase.
This should not be taken to imply that multiple drug use play a less important role in
recent periods. It accounted for 56% of the total change between 1999 and 2014 and 62%, 67%
and 59% of the growth when starting the analysis in 2004, 2007 and 2010. The contribution of
psychotropic medications also rises when restricting the analysis period to more recent years,
from 31% for any mentions from 1999-2014 to 44% for 2006-2014, with 7% and 11% accounted
for by exclusive mentions. The patterns are more variable for most other types of drugs, which
usually also have less explanatory power.
Table 10 illustrates these differences in a fairly extreme way, showing the contributions
towards the increases in drug deaths by splitting the sample equally across periods: 1999 to 2006
and 2007 to 2014. During the earlier timespan, increases in deaths involving any mentions of
opioid analgesics account for 79% of the rise in drug deaths with exclusive mentions being
responsible for 38%. By contrast, any mentions of these drugs are related to just 38% of the
increase in deaths from 2007 to 2014, and exclusive use for none at all, largely because of the
decline in methadone deaths. And heroin plays the dominant role in the increase between 2007
and 2014, with any mentions accounting for 97% of the change and exclusive mentions for 43%.
Combination drug use also becomes more important in the later period (67% vs. 46%), as do

Page 28

psychotropics and other specified drugs, whereas cocaine mentions are considerably less so.
Sedatives also play a great role in the second half of the period, but only because of the
increasing prevalence of combination drug use – exclusive sedative prevalence declines slightly.
8. Discussion
Current death certificate data are problematic for understanding the drug poisoning
epidemic, with a particular issue being the frequency that no specific drug is identified (Slavova
et al., 2015). Additional training and standardization in states with low specification rates may be
helpful, particularly since this is a bigger problem when death certificates are completed by
coroners (instead of medical examiners) and in states without centralized oversight (Warner et
al., 2013). Others have also recommended adding detail to death certificates on the drugs
involved, toxicology levels, ICD categories, as well as more carefully distinguishing between
cases where a given drug is the cause of mortality versus those where it was detected but not a
major contributor (Webster & Dasgupta, 2011; Goldberger et al., 2013).
Until such information becomes available, predictive adjustment methods such as those
developed here can provide more accurate prevalence estimates. The benefits are considerable
since death certificates often understate the involvement of specific drug types by 30% to 60%,
combination drug use by 50% or more, and exclusive use of drug classes by 20% to 30%. The
adjustment procedures work well but not perfectly, for example reducing the prevalence of
exclusive mentions of unspecified drugs from 20% to 4% in 2014. However, several issues
remain. One is that death certificates may be incomplete, even when drugs are specified. A
preliminary analysis suggests that more detailed reporting would considerably raise mentions of
sedative, psychotropic, other specified and combination drug use but have smaller effects on
opioid analgesic, heroin or cocaine involvement. A second is that the reporting itself may be

Page 29

inaccurate. For instance, heroin use may sometimes instead be attributed to morphine or
codeine—because heroin metabolizes into morphine and codeine may be detected as an impurity
in morphine or heroin (Mertz et al., 2014). Third, overdose deaths could also be misclassified as
due to non-drug causes, and therefore excluded from the analysis, while non-drug causes could
be primarily responsible for the death for some deaths that are included. Similarly, information
on specific drug involvement is not provided for the small number of cases (727 in 2014) where
the underlying cause of death is classified as a mental or behavioral disorder due to drug use
(ICD-10 codes F11 through F16).
These caveats notwithstanding, the findings of this analysis have important implications.
The number of U.S. residents dying from drug poisoning rose from 16,849 in 1999 to 47,055 in
2014. In all years analyzed, prescription opioids are the most common class of drugs involved,
justifying the ongoing concerted actions to reduce the negative consequences associated with
their use. At least partially due to these efforts, the number of fatal overdoses involving opioid
analgesics declined more than 7% between 2011 and 2013 (from 24,271 to 22,501), before rising
again in 2014 (to 24,769); however, the total number of drug poisoning deaths has continued to
rise (from 41,340 to 47,505). Indeed, deadly overdoses have increased in every year since 1990,
even as the involvement of specific drugs has changed. For example, deaths involving cocaine
fell 30% (from 10,133 to 7,131) between 2006 and 2014 whereas those where heroin was
implicated skyrocketed 498% (from 2,360 to 14,103) from 2004 to 2014, with most of this
growth since 2010. 30
A key finding is that a majority of overdose fatalities involve multiple classes of drugs,
making it difficult or impossible to attribute the secular increase to specific drugs. Combination

drug use itself is likely to be a risk factor. For example, benzodiazepines were estimated to be
involved in 11,843 deaths in 2014 versus just 1,847 in 1999 but were virtually never the only
drug playing a role. However, the health risks of using opioids and benzodiazepines together are
almost certainly greater than of either in isolation (Jones, et al., 2012; Park, et al., 2015) and
interactions between types of drugs are poorly understood. Most significantly, the modest decline
since 2011 in opioid analgesic-related mortality has been accompanied by an enormous increase
in deaths involving heroin, but with mixed evidence on whether the two types of drugs are
substitutes (Cicero et al. 2012; Markon & Crites, 2014) or complements (Rudd et al., 2014).
Finally, attribution of the secular increase in fatal overdoses to specific drug categories
turns out to be sensitive to the time periods analyzed. Because deaths involving opioid analgesics
rose extremely rapidly at the start of the 21st century (e.g. from 5,275 in 1999 to 22,015 in 2009),
they appear to be “responsible” for a large percentage of growth in drug poisoning deaths for any
period that begins at or near 1999 (regardless of the ending year). Conversely, heroin plays the
most important role for periods starting in 2004 or later, and beginning as early as 2001 when
basing the calculations on exclusive drug involvement. This reflects the very rapid growth in
heroin-related fatalities since the mid-2000s. By contrast, the role of combination drug use is
large and robust to the choice of starting and ending years – almost always explaining 40% to
60% of the growth in deaths – further highlighting its importance for the design of effective
policies to reduce fatal drug poisonings.

least one specific drug is mentioned for all poisoning deaths in the county (SPECIFY =1). Probit
models are estimated, except in (2) which shows linear probability model estimates. Columns
(1), (2) and (4) also control for: sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, age, day of the
week of death, and census region. Model (4) adds supplementary covariates for whether the
death was intentional or accidental (versus undetermined or homicide) and whether an autopsy
was performed.

Drug Mentions

Note: See notes on Tables 1 and 3. Adjusted prevalences are average predicted values from
probit models, where at least one specific drug is mentioned for all poisoning deaths in the
county (SPECIFY =1). In model (1) the calculations assume that there are no mentions of
unspecified drugs (SOME=0); model (2) assumes that ≥1 unspecified drugs are also mentioned
(SOME=1). Models also control for: sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, age, day of the
week of death, and census region. Robust standard errors are calculated with clustering at the
county level.

Note: Table shows predicted number of conditions listed on 2014 drug poisoning death
certificates obtained by regressing the number of conditions on the county share of deaths where
at least one drug is specified (SPECIFY) and, in the bottom panel, on the county share of deaths
where there are both specified and unspecified drugs mentions (SOME). Predicted values are
displayed at the listed values of SPECIFY and (in the bottom panel) SOME. All models also
control for: sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, age, day of the week of death, and
census region. Robust standard errors are calculated with clustering at the county level.
