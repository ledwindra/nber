A Distant Mirror of Debt, Default, and Relief

ABSTRACT
We take a first pass at quantifying the magnitudes of debt relief achieved through default and restructuring
in two distinct samples: 1979-2010, focusing on credit events in emerging markets, and 1920-1939,
documenting the official debt hangover in advanced economies that was created by World War I and
its aftermath. We examine the economic performance of debtor countries during and after these overhang
episodes, by tracing the evolution of real per capita GDP (levels and growth rates); sovereign credit
ratings; debt servicing burdens relative to GDP, fiscal revenues, and exports; as well as the level of
government debt (external and total). Across 45 crisis episodes for which data is available we find
that debt relief averaged 21 percent of GDP for advanced economies (1932-1939) and 16 percent of
GDP for emerging markets (1979-2010), respectively. The economic landscape after a final debt reduction
is characterized by higher income levels and growth, lower debt servicing burdens and lower government
debt. Also ratings recover markedly, albeit only in the modern period.

Introduction
“When I was a youngster growing up in South Dakota, we never referred to the national debt, it was
always referred to as the war debt because it stemmed from World War I.”
George McGovern2
Before the subprime financial crisis erupted in the summer of 2007, academic and policy
discussions on the topic of debt relief were almost exclusively directed toward initiatives for the highly
indebted poorest countries (HIPC).3 Advanced economies, apparently, had outgrown volatile business
cycles and financial crises. Sovereign debt crises were a distant memory for them.4 Emerging markets,
having weathered the turbulence of 1994-2003, were also on the mend, helped along by a favorable
external environment of low and stable international interest rates and robust commodity prices. The
debts of the First World War and the controversial defaults by nearly all advanced economies from 1932
to 1934 were an intellectual curiosity with little relevance to current circumstances.
The global financial crisis and its aftermath (which still lingers) abruptly disrupted that tranquility
setting and the accompanying complacency. New restructurings in Greece returned after a hiatus of nearly
80 years (the last Greek default started in 1932 and ended in 1966). The ongoing depression in periphery
Europe has already surpassed the economic collapse of the 1930s by some markers, with unemployment
rates reaching levels not seen since that era. In most advanced economies, record private debt overhangs
are only slowly unwinding, while the steady upward march in public debts continues unabated. The broad
subject of sovereign debt crises and the role of debt write-offs in their resolution is no longer a matter
solely of academic interest.
Research until now has been mostly devoted to documenting the incidence of external and
domestic default, various features of their causes, and the macroeconomic panorama surrounding them.

This paper provides a first pass at quantifying the magnitudes of debt relief achieved and the subsequent
economic performance of the debtors.
We follow two complementary strands of analysis. One focuses on the highly varied credit events
in the middle-high income emerging markets in the modern era. Recent work by Cruces and Trebesch
(2013, henceforth C&T), which is in line with the approach developed in Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer
(2006), provides a comprehensive quantitative analysis of haircuts on sovereign debt for practically the
universe of emerging market restructuring episodes from 1978 to 2010.5 We look at these haircuts not
from their vantage point of the investor, but from our perspective of debt relief to the borrower.
The second strand extends our earlier work, bringing to the dissection table crises episodes that
are comparatively understudied. Specifically, we turn our attention to the interwar debt hangover of
official (government to government) debt created by World War I and its aftermath.6 We have quantified
and studied the amounts and details of the large network of war-related official debts for 18 advanced
economies. This allows us to estimate the extent of debt relief in this episode for the first time.
The war debt rescheduling and relief has many parallels to the developing country debt crisis and
debt relief initiatives, in particular the Brady deals of the 1990s. Box 1 provides a thumbnail comparison
of three international episodes: the 1920s/1930s, the 1980s/1990s and post-2007. As with bank loans in
the 1970s and 1980s, war debts were the dominant type of indebtedness for many advanced countries in
the 1920s. 7 Just as for many emerging markets in the 1980s, much of the 1920s and 1930s were a “lost
decade (s)” for European countries. Much of the international policy discourse of that time was an
ongoing debate on the need for debt relief. As was the case in the mid-1980s, there were preliminary
rescheduling agreements in the early 1920s, which postponed the repayment of war related debts for more
than 10 years, but without a reduction in the nominal debt burden (Moulton and Pasvolsky 1932). Finally,

The literature on default is primarily about private creditors and sovereign borrowers; World War I debt and
reparations are about official creditors and sovereign borrowers.

just as in the early 1990s, the war debt overhang was resolved by widespread and large-scale default and
debt relief. This explicit debt reduction was a central way to cope with Fisher’s (1933) debt-deflation
spiral, thus complementing the devaluation and inflation events importantly.

There are also parallels between todays public and private debt overhangs in advanced economies
and those of the post WWI era (see Box 1). During the 1930s, concerns about the debt burdens
intensified, especially after country after country succumbed to systemic financial crises during 19291931 and protracted economic depression. Since the onset of the subprime crisis in 2007, the nature of the
debt overhang has also evolved markedly. What were predominantly private debts prior to and at the time
of the global financial crisis have now become official or public debts. Both the modern and the 1920-

4

1930s episodes are synchronous, affecting many advanced economies simultaneously. Moreover, in all
three episodes the importance of official debts increased markedly from the beginning of the crisis.
Eichengreen and Portes’ (1986) study the interwar years with the aim of explaining the incidence
of sovereign default (on private creditors) and characterizing the performance of rates of returns on
sovereign bonds. We follow their advice on the direction of future research:
“A further omission especially relevant to our analysis of default is the treatment of war debts
and reparations generally and the 1931 Hoover Moratorium in particular.
Another intriguing issue we have not yet begun to address is the relationship of default to the
subsequent economic performance of borrowing countries.”
We assess the magnitude, scope and timing of debt relief for the advanced economies in the
1930s (with a primary focus on war debts) and the emerging markets post 1979. Our strategy of studying
in parallel events and economic outcomes in advanced and emerging market economies is along the lines
of Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012), who examine the antecedents and immediate aftermath of banking,
currency, and debt crises. Our time frame of analysis is complementary to theirs, as we are interested in
the patterns surrounding the eventual exit from debt crises. The indicators analyzed in the post-debt-relief
period include: real per capita GDP (levels and growth rates); sovereign credit ratings, including Fitch,
Moodys and Institutional Investors; debt servicing burdens (interest and amortization) relative to GDP,
GNI, revenues, and exports; external debt (public plus private) for emerging markets; total, external, and
domestic central government debt relative to GDP, GNI, and exports.
Our main findings can be summarized as follows:
Across 45 default and restructuring episodes over 1932-1939 and 1979-2010 for which we have
the required data, debt relief averaged 21 and 16 percent of GDP for advanced economies and middlehigh-income emerging markets, respectively; these estimates represent a lower bound on the true
magnitude of debt relief.

5

The size of the advanced economy debt write-downs (relative to GDP) arising from the 19321934 defaults on World War I debt are not dissimilar from the estimates for the post-1970 middle-high
income emerging market defaults and restructurings.
The cumulative average increase in per capita GDP over the four years following a decisive
restructuring or default is 9 and 16 percent for the emerging markets and advanced economies,
respectively. Decisive refers to the default or the last write down in a sequence - “restructuring to end all
restructurings.” In the case of World War I Debt, the June 15, 1934 default settled the matter for that
episode; for the emerging market cases, it is the last restructuring that marks the exit from default status.8
The incidence of a marked pick-up in economic activity following a debt write-down is
widespread. Of the 47 combined advanced and emerging market episodes for which we have per capita
real GDP data, 39 (83 percent) expanded from T to T+4. In six of the remaining eight cases, real per
capita GDP was flat (defined as less than or equal to a one percent change in either direction) postrestructuring; and two episodes out of 47 had a significant decline in real per capita GDP.
On the question of capital market access, we look for patterns in the evolution of sovereign credit
ratings post default. Here the interwar experience departs considerably from the emerging market (19792010) outcomes.
For the emerging market episodes over 1979-2010, we examine Institutional Investor Sovereign
Ratings (IIR) for 30 episodes for which there is full data. The average increases (improvement) in the IIR
index are 22 percent after two years and 38 percent after four years.
For 7 of the episodes (23 percent), the cumulative increase in the IIR from T to T+4 is in excess
of 60 percent. This pattern of recovery is broadly consistent with the findings in Gelos, Sahay, and

8

In a significant number of instances there is only a single restructuring. However, there are numerous default spells
where the number of restructurings ranges from two to eight.

6

Sandleris (2011), who conclude market access following default comes swiftly (well within the four year
window examined here).

The single lowest IIR reading at T+4 was Ecuador’s (about 10 percent lower than when it exited
from default in 1995). 9 But this negative outcome was not because Ecuador remained shut out of capital
markets since its “final” Brady Plan restructuring but rather because it was quick to re-leverage after the
restructuring by 1998 (T+4), Ecuador was heading for a new debt crisis in 1999-2000.10
Debt service burdens (amortizations plus interest payments) as a share of: GDP, GNI, central
government revenues, or exports decline following a restructuring. For the war debt default episodes, the
ratio of debt service to revenues falls from an average of about 34 percent in the late 1920s to about 24
percent a decade later. For the emerging markets (1979-2010), debt servicing declines in advance of the
“final restructuring,” as often there are multiple debt reduction efforts prior to the exit from default. The
decline is most pronounced in debt service-to-exports ratio, which drops from 37 percent in the three
years prior to default to 19 percent in the three years after exiting from default. We caution that even in
the absence of haircuts, external factors could account for some of the observed reduction in debt
servicing. Specifically, there is a sustained trend decline in real international interest rates following the
abrupt spike in 1979 through mid-1982.
On the question of whether the debt write-downs actually reduced debt, we focus primarily on
external debt and compare the advanced economy and emerging market experience over a nine-year span
from four years before default (restructuring) to four years afterwards. For the advanced economies, we
examine external (foreign) central government debt/GDP. The selection of external debt is warranted by
the fact that the war debts were external debt arrangements among sovereign governments. For the
emerging markets, the haircut calculus from Cruces and Trebesch (2013) is also for external credit events.

9

There are a total of 3 of the 30 cases (including Ecuador) where the rating was below what it was at the time of the
last restructuring.
10
See Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003) on this phenomenon and the subsection entitled Did default or
restructuring reduce the debt? this paper.

7

On average (across 35 advanced economy and emerging market episodes for which we have complete
debt data), external debt/ GDP or GNI falls 19 percentage points over the nine-year window. There is a
vast range in variation in the debt outcomes, ranging from a cumulative debt reduction of 125 percent of
GDP or GNI to a debt build-up of 37 percent.
Two additional observations: First, the number of countries which record deleveraging is
considerably higher (27 episodes) than the tally of those ending up with a higher level of external debt (7
episodes).11 Second, the outcomes corresponding to the advanced economies are not clustered in a
particular range and, indeed, their experience is distributed similarly to that of emerging markets. As
Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) find, the patterns seen in emerging and advanced economies' crises are
qualitatively similar, except that emerging market credit ratings were penalized more heavily at the time
of default.12
The paper proceeds as follows: In the following section we describe the methodology, data
requirements and other conceptual issues while Section III introduces the advanced economies and
emerging market restructuring and default episodes that are the centerpiece of the paper. Section IV is
devoted to the comparisons of the modern emerging market experiences with the defaults on war debt of
the 1930s. Concluding remarks discuss related policy issues and scope for research in this area while
appendices present supplementary material.
II. Concepts and Methodology
In the remainder of this section, we provide: (1) definitions for the concepts employed throughout
the analysis (be it the type of sovereign crisis, the type of debt, creditor types, etc.); (2) a sketch of our
basic methodology to calculate the magnitude of debt relief associated with a default or a restructuring;

11

The US shows no change in external debt, as it did not have any external debt over this sample. Altogether this
brings the total number of advanced and emerging market episodes to 35. The 1934 abrogation of the gold clause is
the only domestic restructuring episode in out sample.
12
Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) cover banking, currency, and debt crises over 1973 to 2010. This offers ample
opportunity for the comparison of banking and currency crises in EMs and advanced economies. In this window,
however, debt crises are confined to emerging markets; the inclusion of the 1930s defaults in advanced economies
extends the comparison in an important dimension.

(3) a brief description of data requirements and their respective sources. A Data Appendix completes the
task of providing individual sources in greater detail.
1. Default, restructuring spells, and other concepts
Box 2 provides a compact definition and commentary on the main events studied in this paper—
specifically, sovereign debt crises. All the episodes (with a single exception) that are introduced in
Section III and analyzed in the remainder of the paper fall into the category of sovereign external debt
crises, as defined in Box 2. The aforementioned exception is a sovereign domestic crisis, which is the
category that the United States’ January 1934 haircut falls into, as it was confined to debt issued by the
United States Treasury under domestic law (it also happened that the debt was held almost exclusively by
domestic residents, and denominated in domestic currency, although prior to the haircut, it was linked to
gold).
Within the realm of external sovereign debt crisis, we deal with two distinct varieties: The most
common variety involves private creditors and sovereign borrowers. This type of credit event, in its many
guises, captures the episodes of 1979-2010 in emerging markets. The other variety involves official
creditors (specifically sovereign governments) lending to other sovereign governments. The episodes
covered in the interwar sample (World War I and reconstruction debts) fall into this category. To be
clear, in light of the severe financial crises and economic depression of the 1930s, there were many
episodes of default and restructuring involving private creditors as well—but these are not the focal point
of our study (we refer to these to the extent that they overlap or interact with the settlement of the war
debt).13
Box 2 also defines some of the timing conventions used in our analysis. On other conventions, we
use the term default and restructuring interchangeably, as the latter is a partial default (a haircut), and, as
described in Box 2, a restructuring changes the terms of the original contract to terms less favorable to the

creditor. Rating agencies also treat restructurings in this manner. Before turning to out methodology for
estimating the size of debt relief in each default spell, a few more definitions on debt types will clarify our
choices of data.
As our debt crises are predominantly external, we focus primarily (but not exclusively) on
external debt. In terms of borrowers, external debt can be public, publicly guaranteed, or private (which
does not necessarily mean it is not ultimately guaranteed also). As to lenders, these can be official
(sovereign governments), multilateral institutions (League of Nations, International Monetary Fund,
World Bank, etc.), or private creditors.
The interwar component of our analysis is focused on public debt, more precisely, external (or
foreign) public debt (this refers to central government debt in all cases except Italy where general
government debt is used). External public debt is where the war debt was housed, unless we note
otherwise. 14 Over 1920-1939, we also examine the evolution of central government domestic and total
debt, as default on war debt brought about important changes in the composition of the public sector
balance sheet.
In the emerging market episodes, we also work with more than one time series. The estimated
haircuts are based on public and public guaranteed debt from private creditors (excluding IMF loans,
official loans, etc.). To ascertain the larger macroeconomic picture around restructurings, we also trace
the evolution of total external debt (the sum of public and private debt from all creditors).

14

For example, in the case of Italy, since March 1926, the service of the war debt was relegated to the Autonomous
Fund of the War debts. Where possible, we keep a track record of how the War debt and its service is integrated in
the public sector accounts.

Box 1. Crisis, Default, and Timing Definitions

Definition

Comments

External
sovereign
debt crisis

A sovereign default is defined as the
failure to meet a principal or interest
payment on the due date (or within the
specified grace period). These episodes
also include instances where
rescheduled debt is ultimately
extinguished in terms less favorable
than the original obligation.
An external sovereign default involves
debt that is classified as external
because it was issued under foreign
law. Usually (but not always) such debt
is denominated in a foreign currency
and is predominantly held by
nonresidents.

In this study, we have two types of external
debt crises: Defaults of debts between
governments (this encompasses World War I
debt and reparations payments) and private
sector lending to official borrowers or to
institutions that are publicly guaranteed (the
emerging market defaults or restructurings
fall into this category).

Domestic
sovereign
debt crisis

The definition given above for external
debt applies, except these episodes
cover debt issued under domestic law.
Such debt may be denominated in
domestic or foreign currency and held
by either residents or nonresidents.
Domestic debt crises have also often
involved the freezing of bank deposits
and or forcible conversions of such
deposits from dollars to local currency.

The US 1934 abrogation of the gold clause is
the only domestic debt crisis we examine.
In line with the definition above, the
delinking from gold meant that the debt was
“ultimately extinguished in terms less
favorable than the original obligation.”

In this study we define T as the year of
the final restructuring or default; the
year of the last debt relief in that
default spell.

For WWI defaults, T=1934 for all debtor
countries, while debt relief began in 1931
with the Hoover Moratorium, the WWI debt
issue was not resolved until the June 15
across the board default. From that date, only
Finland made payments on the War debt.
1934 would not be the final date if we were
focused on default episodes on private
creditors. For example, Germany did not
reach its final restructuring until 1952.
For emerging market episodes, T is the date
of the final restructuring that marks the exit
from default. For instance, Mexico defaulted
in August 1982 (start of the default spell); it
had six restructuring deals between the start
date (1982) and 1990 the date of the final
restructuring (T=end date=exit from default).

2. Haircuts and debt relief
It is quite common in our sample to see multiple debt reduction efforts in consecutive years (in
some years there may even be more than one restructuring); these are not, in our estimation, separate debt
crises but the same lingering unresolved one, which can go on for a decade and longer. Many developing
countries went through a series of debt restructurings throughout the 1980s before finally resolving the
crisis in the 1990s. Similarly, we find that the war debt and reconstruction loans owed to the US and the
UK had been renegotiated in almost all debtor countries prior to the defaults of 1934 (see below, and
Moulton and Pasvolsky 1932, for an overview). Also the recent Greek restructuring has been a multi-year
ongoing process, as documented in Zettelmeyer, Trebesch, and Gulati (2013). Here, our interest is to
quantify the magnitude of debt relief of the entire default spell rather than that of individual deals.
The database on haircuts constructed by C&T (2013) presents, for each restructuring deal, the
amount of debt affected as well as two measures of the haircut agreed upon in each deal. Their approach
follows a series of papers by Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2006, 2007 and 2008), who focus on eight
case studies of more recent crises. This information, along with the corresponding US dollar GDP figures
for the corresponding years, is shown in Appendix Table B1 for a total of 97 individual restructuring
deals in the 30 middle-high income countries we study over 1978-2010. From this information, a
cumulative haircut measure for the entire default spell is (see C&T, 2013 Appendix p. 3) and synopsis
below.15 16 The default spell dates are from Reinhart and Rogoff (2009). Thus, the 97 individual
restructurings correspond to 35 default spells in 30 countries. Argentina, Dominican Republic, and
Uruguay had two separate default episodes or spells; Ecuador had three.

16

In effect, in the same spirit of C&T (2013) two cumulative haircut estimates can be derived; the first is based on
the “preferred” haircut measure for each successive restructuring and a market cumulative measure, which replaces
the preferred haircut measure with the market calculation.

12

The cumulative effective haircut can be interpreted as the compound losses of a passive investor
who held a face value-weighted basket of all the country’s securities and whose debts are restructured
sequentially in each deal up to and including the final deal. For the final deal i this measure is:

The wealth conservation ratio is 1 minus the effective haircut and draws on GFD data to private creditors.

A sample calculation for Argentina 1982-1993, tracing out the effects of successive cumulative haircuts
over a lengthy (but typical of the debt crisis of the 1980s) default episode, is available from the authors
upon request.
For the war debt defaults, as the entire stock of debt was written off, we work with the
outstanding stock of debt as a share of GDP as our preferred estimate of the haircut. Consistent with C&T
(2013) we add unpaid interest and principal arrears to the debt stock. In addition to this face value haircut,
we compute present value haircuts on the war debt based on the contractually agreed principal and
13

interest payments of the restructuring agreements of the 1920s. The exact terms for each country are taken
from the original debt agreements, reprinted in the authoritative study on war debts by Moulton and
Pasvolsky (1932). Specifically, we use the terms for the reprofiling agreements of US war debt with
Austria (May 1930), Belgium (August 1925), Czechoslovakia (October 1925), Estonia (October 1925),
Finland (May 1923), France (April 1926), Great Britain (June 1923), Greece (May 1925), Hungary (April
1924), Italy (November 1925), Latvia (September 1925), Lithuania (September 1924), Poland (November
1925), Poland (November 1924), Romania (December 1925), and Yugolsavia (May 1926). For the UK
war debt we use the terms of the settlements of Belgium (December 1925), France (July 1926), Greece
(April 1927), Italy (January 1926), Portugal (December 1926), Romania (October 1935), and Yugolsavia
(1927).17 For all future payments, we use a 5% annual discount rate, which follows the approach chosen
in Moulton and Pasvolsky (1932).
3. Data and sources
Our comparisons involve two distinct eras separated by forty years; 1920-1939 and 1979-2010.
The interwar defaults are about wartime official debts rather than peacetime private lending. Studying
these two groups of necessarily requires a broad array of databases and an even broader collection of
sources. While a Data Appendix provides greater detail, the major data sources are briefly introduced in
Box 3.
In addition to the sources associated with the time series used in this study, there are also
important sources used to build the chronology of events surrounding the interwar settlement of war debt
that are presented in the next section. Annual League of Nations World Economic Surveys covering 19311940 are invaluable sources. Pick and Sedillot (1971) and United Nations (1948) figure as prominently
useful. Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Reinhart (2010) date the credit events.

17

We could not yet gather details on the agreements of Australia, New Zealand, and Portugal on their debt owed to

III. The Episodes and Debt Relief
In this section, we introduce the restructuring and default episodes that will be the centerpiece of
our study; we sketch some of their more salient features. All episodes except the Unites States’ 1934
abrogation of the gold clause involve external debt. The debt in question is predominantly (but not
exclusively) issued under foreign law, denominated in a foreign currency, and held by non-residents. In
the cases we examine from the 1930s, we largely confine our attention to World War I debt. War debt is
15

somewhat of a misnomer, as for most borrowers (the exception is the United Kingdom) much of the debt
included under this rubric was contracted after the war had ended and had the distinct character of
reconstruction and stabilization loans.18 A distinguishing feature of this debt is that it is almost entirely
contained within the official sectors - both the borrower and the lenders are sovereign governments.
We focus, in particular, on official debts owed to the two largest creditor countries of the time,
the United States and the United Kingdom (see Moulton and Pasvolsky 1932). The United Kingdom was
a major creditor country to most European countries and owed debt only to the United States. The United
States was a pure creditor and did not owe official debts to any other country. These two countries are
therefore the two main creditor powers of the interwar period.
For the emerging market episodes of 1978-2010 are different in this respect; the typical pattern
involves private creditors and official borrowers. Often enough, however, the debts that end up
restructured in these episodes under a sovereign umbrella started out as private debt, which the
government stepped in to guarantee at a time of crisis.19
The academic literature on sovereign default and restructuring has been primarily preoccupied
with private creditors lending to public borrowers. The study of default on official debt is far more
limited. The combination and comparison of these hybrid episodes is a novel feature of this paper.
Before launching into a discussion of the war debts and their demise, the environment of the
1930s has to be placed in historical context. Bordo and Jonung (2001) who examine chronologically
monetary and fiscal regimes from 1881 through 1995, provide an encompassing international setting and
offer the following observations: (i) WWI not only gave rise to the high debt levels we examine here, but
also saw governments become increasingly reliant on the inflation tax.20; (ii) the return of peace brought a

desire for monetary stability but at the same gave rise to the policy dilemma we are interested in. They
observe:
“…in several of the belligerent countries a decision had to be made concerning the treatment of
public debt, that is over the time path of budget surpluses to amortize outstanding debt. Governments had
to choose whether to run contractionary fiscal policies, which would retire outstanding debt, or to default
explicitly or implicitly via inflation. Any decision would have profound effects on the distribution of
income between debtors and creditors.”
Over the course of the interwar era (which Bordo and Jonung, 2001 apportion into three distinct
regimes: the return to gold in the mid-1920s, the relatively short-lived gold standard, and the final
collapse of gold), we will see the progression from earlier attempts to tighten fiscal conditions and pay
down the war debt to both explicit default and implicit via reflation and the abandonment of the gold
anchor.
1. World War I debts
Table 1 lists 18 countries that, as of 1934, owed debt to the United States and the United
Kingdom from World War I and its aftermath. Australia, New Zealand and Portugal only owed debt to
the United Kingdom. Finland, which was the only country to fully honor its war debt obligations to the
United States, drops out of the analysis.21 We add to this list of 18 default cases the United States 1934
haircut (Table A1 in the appendix). This brings the total number of 1930s episodes to 19. In the various
empirical exercises that follow, these countries are incorporated to the extent that the data permits. The
core episodes with the most complete profile are: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
United Kingdom, and United States.

21

Finland was fully preoccupied dealing with Russians following its still recent independence and apparently
wished to keep in best terms with the United States.

17

The first column of Table 1 gives the amount of debt outstanding plus interest arrears at the time
of the generalized default in June 1934. These amounts owed to the US and the UK vary somewhat across
sources. For instance, the unpaid obligations that are recorded in the United Nations 1948 publication,
Public Debt, 1914–1946, and in Baily (1950, p. 701)22 are not strictly the same as those shown in Table 1,
which are taken from the annual financial reports by the US Treasury or in the Moody’s Manuals on
Foreign Securities (although all numbers are quite close). Discrepancies may also arise from the exchange
rate used to convert the debt into local currency, so as to allow one to construct a measure of the debt
relief relative to GDP. Our point estimates of debt relief (the last column) are based on the nominal GDP
and exchange rates shown. When in doubt, we have opted for the more conservative estimates.
Table A1 in the appendix presents for the United States episode comparable calculations to those
shown for the European countries. The debt outstanding as reported by the US Treasury is given for Nov
15, 1934, while nominal GDP are calendar year figures. The adoption of the Gold Reserve Act, which
delinked US Treasury debt from gold (among other things) and devalued the dollar against gold, occurs
on January 30-31, 1934. To address the lack of synchronicity, we provide the 1933 and 1934 figures to
bracket the estimate of debt reduction delivered.

Sources: Debt amounts owed to the US are from the Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the State of the
Finances - For Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1934, pp. 391. Debt figures are given for Nov 15, 1934. We add to this the
amount of arrears, i.e. overdue payments under the debt restructuring agreements of the 1920s. Debt amounts owed to the
UK are from the Moody's Manual of Investments and Securities Rating Service: Foreign and American Government
Securities, 1935, p.1927. Debt figures are given for March 31, 1934, plus arrears. To compute present values (last column)
we use the terms shown in the original loan documents, as shown in Moulton and Pasvolsky (1932). We follow their
approach and use a 5% annual rate to discount future war debt payments. The amounts of debt outstanding under the broad
category of WWI debt includes, especially for Eastern Europe, debts taken on after the war in connection with
reconstruction. The breakdown is given for each debtor country in Reinhart and Rogoff (2014).

Having introduced both the broader and core sample for the advanced economies defaults and
provided some benchmarks for the magnitude of the defaults, we next take up the issue of the timing and
sequencing of these credit events.
The estimates of debt relief in Table 1 uses primarily 1934 GDP figures, as it uniformly dates the
“de jure” default in that year. While the 1934 default date is appropriate for the United States case, this
dating is less clear cut for the others. De facto, default and other irregularities on war debt payments
began earlier. As the chronology presented in Table 2 makes plain, the intentionally temporary Hoover
Moratorium is set in motion in 1931 (the moratorium also applies to Germany’s reparations payments).
However, at the end of the moratorium in 1932, scheduled payments do not resume in uniform and
regular fashion. While the United Kingdom, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania, and Yugoslavia make the scheduled December 15 payment on war debt, France, Belgium,
Poland, Estonia and Hungary do not pay (see United States entry).23 For the latter group, the more
relevant default date may be 1932 or 1933. Moreover, we know that most European countries suspended
their war debt payments to the United Kingdom after the Lausanne war debt conference of 1932.
However, no country except Finland, which fully repaid as scheduled, continued to service their war debt
to the US or to the UK past June 1934, hence our common dating choice.

2. Middle-high income emerging market episodes: 1980s debt crisis to the present
The emerging market default and restructuring episodes covered in this study are a subset of the
larger universe of debt crises in developing countries. Specifically, we limit our coverage to episodes in
middle-to-high-income emerging markets. It is our contention that the emerging markets of today have
much in common with the advanced economies of the 1930s. Unfortunately, in recent years the same can
24

be said about the advanced economies of today. Most middle-to-high- income emerging markets have
access (albeit with much volatility and frequent sudden stops) to international capital markets and attract
private capital flows in a manner more closely resembling pre-World War II advanced economies than the
low-income countries that rely more heavily on concessional lending and aid.
In earlier work Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) examined the incidence of default. In this paper we
also aim to quantify the magnitude of the debt relief achieved in the numerous defaults and restructurings
in emerging markets since the late 1970s. Our starting point is the comprehensive database on haircuts
recently compiled by Cruces and Trebesch (2013). They provide detailed information on each individual
restructuring over 1979-2010 for all emerging and developing countries that have the prerequisite data.
We aggregate these individual restructurings into a default spell to the extent that they are sequentially
connected. Our dating of default spells is taken from Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).
Table 3 lists the 35 episodes that make up the emerging market sample and column (1) provides
the dates of the default spell (or spells, as some countries like Ecuador and Argentina have more than one
default or restructuring episode since the late 1970s. The cumulative haircuts shown in column (4) are
from Cruces and Trebesch (2013); the final column calculates the debt relief as a percent of GDP in their
baseline computation. A companion Appendix Table B1 presents additional detail on the individual
building blocks of the cumulative default measure shown here. As was the case with the advanced
economies interwar sample, not all episodes can be documented to the same extent. Some of the transition
economies have data that only partially covers their default or restructuring episodes, while some of the
smaller island nations are excluded from databases, (Institutional Investor Ratings, Total Economy
database, etc.)

3. Debt relief estimates
Subject to the limitations discussed in the preceding section, Figure 1a presents our preferred
estimate of the magnitude of debt relief as a share of GDP. The figure shows in ascending order a total 46
individual advanced and emerging market default/restructuring episodes. The corresponding estimate is
shown alongside the country and episode date. The red and green bars denote the advanced and emerging
market economies, respectively.
Nine of the 18 countries defaulting on war debt to the US and the UK in the 1930s (Australia,
Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal and United Kingdom) listed in Table 1
are shown in Figure 1a. The remaining 10 default cases are excluded owing to data limitations, mainly
because no nominal GDP data is available, although we do have the nominal amounts owed and defaulted
upon in June 1934 (see Table 1).24 The haircut associated with the abrogation of the gold clause in the
United States in conjunction with the 41 percent devaluation of the dollar in early 1934 (Table A1) is also
included in Figure 1a. The average debt relief/GDP for this group of 10 is 20.6 percent.
Figure 1b gives more detailed estimates on the war debt relief of 1934 for main creditor countries
(Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom) vis-à-vis the UK and the US.
We compare the debt relief in face value terms (nominal write-off) to our debt relief estimates in present
value terms, using the interest rate and repayment terms from the original debt agreements of each case
and an annual 5% discount rate.25 The war debt restructuring agreement often implied very long maturity
extensions, with new maturities reaching as far as the 1980s. For this reason, the present value debt relief
estimates are often considerably below the face value estimates, especially for agreements with the United
Kingdom. At the same time, the large majority of war loans would have already fallen due by 1934, had
this debt not been rescheduled under very generous terms. The present value relief estimates for 1934 are
therefore artificially small and should be interpreted as the lower bound, while the face value debt

The choice of a 5% discount rate follows the literature of the time, see for instance, Molton and Pasvolsky (1932).

27

reduction is more appropriate assessment on the scope of debt relief in 1934. We are currently working on
computing haircuts for the 1920s agreement so that we can eventually compute cumulative haircuts that
are fully comparable to the C&T (2013) numbers.
The 35 middle-high income emerging market episodes listed in Table 3 yield an average debt
relief estimate of 15.7 percent, about four percentage points lower than on the advanced economy war
debt. The range of variation across the emerging markets is much higher than for the 1930 episodes,
ranging from a high of around 56 percent for Bulgaria to nil. 26 Seven debt restructuring episodes where
debt relief amounted to less than one percent of GDP are not shown in Figure 1a but are included in the
average cited above and reported in Table 3. The episodes are Algeria 1991-1996, Croatia 1992-1996,
Dominican Republic 2005, Gabon 1986-1994, Romania 1981-1986, Slovenia 1992-1996, Turkey 19781982.
While our emphasis in this paper is confined to the middle-to high income emerging market
restructuring episodes listed in Table 3, we also calculate comparable debt relief estimates for lower
income emerging markets included in the Cruces and Trebesch (2013) study. On the whole, debt relief
estimates for the poorer countries run lower despite higher haircuts. The share of affected debt is smaller
both in absolute dollar amounts and relative to domestic GDP, as private lending is limited and official
sources and aid play a more prominent role.
The main conclusions drawn from this exercise in that restructurings averaging 16-21 percent of
GDP were not trivial in helping governments resolve past debt overhangs and that, in effect, (for the
reasons discussed in Section II) these figures may underestimate the true magnitude of debt relief. Most
importantly, the generalized default on war debt was not limited to debt owed the United States and the
United Kingdom (which are the only ones we systematically quantify here). Large amounts of

26

In the case of Bulgaria, the haircut is about 56 percent (Cruces and Trebesch, 2013) and the share of affected debt
to GDP is almost 100 percent (columns 3 and 4, Table 3).

28

governmental debt were also owed to France, Italy and Belgium, including the notorious reparation debts
by Germany.27
Furthermore, the orders of magnitude of the advanced economy debt write-downs relative to the
size of the economy are not dissimilar from the magnitudes seen in the modern vintage EM defaults and
restructurings. Of course, our analysis only offers a first pass at quantifying and comparing seemingly
disparate credit events. Ongoing work makes further refinements in these comparisons introducing a
variety of control groups, which allow for clearer distinctions between episodes that primarily involve
official debt versus episodes that are defaults on private creditors, as well as “decisive” versus
“intermediate” credit events. Our emphasis here on debt reduction via restructuring and default is not
meant to suggest that other forms of debt reduction were not quantitatively important as well. Fiscal
retrenchment, structural reform, financial repression, and (in the case of domestic currency denominated
debt) inflation often co-existed in these episodes of debt write-offs.
Taking together Table 1 and Table A1 in the Appendix, it is also evident that the magnitude of
the US haircut from devaluations and the abrogation of the gold clause relative to GDP is about 16-17
percent, a comparable order of magnitude to the amount it cost the US to forgive European debts. In the
end, it appears as a transfer of resources from US holders of domestic debt to the European sovereigns.

27

Belgium, France and Italy were each owed total war debts of more than 1bn 1933 US Dollars, respectively, see
Moulton and Pasvolsky (1932).

IV. Default and Restructuring Comparisons: Before and After, North and South
This section takes the “north-south” comparison of the sovereign default and restructuring
experience further by examining the evolution of income levels and growth, credit ratings and market
access, debt servicing burdens, and the level and composition of debt around this hybrid cross-country
experience of sovereign default and restructuring.
1. Income levels and growth
Our starting point is to examine the performance of per capita GDP (levels and growth rates)
episode by episode in and around the date of restructuring that anchors the exercise, denoted in all figures
31

and tables by T. Our dating of “T” with its limitations was discussed in Section II. Here we define the
window (years before and after T) used in our analysis. The emphasis is primarily on what happens at the
time (T) and in the aftermath of debt relief, here defined as the “final” or decisive restructuring.
For a few emerging markets, the final restructuring may have been the only one in a short-lived
credit event that lasted two years or less, as was the case for Uruguay in 2003. More often than not,
however, the final exit from default status came after a multi-year stint. The longest cumulative default
spells were for Peru and Jamaica and lasted 18 and 16 years, respectively. In a significant number of
cases, there were several restructurings before “the restructuring to end all restructurings” materialized
(see Appendix Table B1). As Cruces and Trebesch (2013) document, Poland had a total of seven
restructurings before their “final” one in 1994; Jamaica had six before reaching closure on that particular
16-year episode; Brazil had a total of six tries, and so on. The average duration of the full default spells
for the 35 EM episodes shown in Table 3 is 7.3 years.
Also the default and payment irregularities on World War I debt in the advanced economies were
a protracted process, spanning roughly from the debt settlements (which restructured the profile of the
debt) of the early 1920s until the generalized default of mid-1934. The same is true for the debt overhang
on non-World War I public and private debts, which stretching into the post-World War II era. For
example, Austria and Germany were in default through 1952; Italy was in default 1940-1945; Greece and
Hungary had even longer stints in default status through 1964 and 1967, respectively. 28 In addition, there
was the notorious issue with the German Reparation Debt which originated in the Treaty of Versailles in
1919, is declared in default for the first time in 1922 (Table 2), is restructured under the Dawes Plan in
1924, restructured again under the Young Plan in 1929, and ultimately defaulted on during 1932-1934.
We focus on a four-year window around T; the first leg, T-4 to T can provide a sense of the runup of credit events that bring some closure and debt relief. However, this four-year window does not

28

See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).

32

allow us to say much (except for the very short default episodes) about the antecedents of a “new” default
or restructuring episode. Thus, our analysis and results are not to be comingled and confused with the
literature on early warnings of debt crises (see Reinhart, 2002, Manasse, Roubini and Schimmelpfennig,
2003 and Manasse and Roubini, 2009), which attempt to characterize the run-up to the first wave of
distress.29 Our interest in this paper is aligned more closely with Gelos, Sahay, and Sandleris (2011), who
study what factors determine access to international capital markets for a large sample of emerging
markets, examine international capital flows following a default, an issue we take up later in this section.
30

Figure 2 plots average real per capita GDP level (normalized to equal one at time T) around final
restructurings (exit from default).31 The average covers 33 of the 35 middle-high income emerging
markets (Table 3) for which we have real per capita GDP data.32 The red line shows the comparable
average for12 of the 16 defaulters the 1930s shown in Table 1a plus the United States and Germany.
While the lines show the level of per capita GDP, from both the normalization to T=1 and the inset box,
Figure 2, also summarizes the growth performance.
For the 1930s average, 1932 marks the trough in per capita GDP with barely any change through
1934. After 1934 there is a sharp rebound (cumulative growth is 16% from T to T+4) following a
prolonged collapse of 7 percent. Rebound notwithstanding, it takes six years to recoup the income level
recorded in T-4 (as we will show, it takes even longer to surpass the prior economic peak in per capita
GDP, which usually predated T-4 and corresponds to 1930). The emerging market countries show a flat
per capita GDP path while in the default spell (through T) but a substantial pick up thereafter.

29

In Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) also, T is set as the first year of a default spell and hence asks a different question.
Gelos et al. (2011), however, date the beginning of the default spell not its conclusion.

In sum, while the magnitude of recovery in per capita GDP over the four years following a
decisive restructuring or default ranges from a cumulative average increase of 9 to 16 percent for the two
groups of emerging and advanced economies, the more salient feature of the exercise is finding that there
is broad evidence of a marked pick-up in economic activity following debt write-off/debt relief episodes.
Of the 47 combined advanced and emerging market episodes, 39 had positive growth over T to T+4. Of
the remaining eight, six had a flat real per capita GDP profile (defined as less than or equal to a one
percent change in either direction) and two out of 47 had negative cumulative growth.

34

It is beyond the scope of this paper to apportion to what extent the post-debt relief recovery owed
to the restructuring per se and what role may have been played by other factors. In the case of the 1930s
episodes, Eichengreen (1992) stressed the importance of stimulus provided by exits from the gold
standard.33 However, these exits from the golden fetters were spread over a five-year period, from the
early British and Greek exits in 1931 (Table 2) to the French exit five years later in 1936. The defaults
and debt write-downs were clustered much more closely in the trough 1932-1934. On the fiscal front, of
course public works programs were also initiated in the T to T+4 span during the depression, but as with
monetary policy there was considerable dispersion in their timing and magnitudes. For emerging markets,
the usually sharp depreciations that accompany debt crises (see Reinhart, 2002) may have been a force
behind these recoveries.

2. Capital market access and sovereign credit ratings
We next examine the evolution of credit ratings around the episodes of interest. In several
influential models of sovereign default, the reputational damage done by a default lasts forever and access
to international capital markets is irrevocably lost.34 In reality, we know that governments who have
behaved badly (defaulted on their obligations) ultimately regain their ability to borrow again and, in
scores of cases, default again and again. An interesting question is what can be learned about market
access from the behavior of sovereign credit ratings in the aftermath of a default or restructuring. We
discuss the 1930s sample and the modern emerging market episodes in turn.
In the midst of an environment characterized by profound economic contraction, systemic global
banking crisis, trade wars, record unemployment, and a rising incidence of private and sovereign defaults
it is hardly surprising that sovereign credit ratings drifted steadily lower through most of the 1930s in
Europe and elsewhere. Linking the contribution to this generalized downward trend to the default on war
debt of one government on another government is a far more complicated question. Table 4 presents the

33

See Bulow and Rogoff (1989) and Eaton and Gersovitz (1981).

35

sovereign ratings for most of the countries that appear in Table 1. It would be difficult to deduce from the
evolution of ratings the fact that France and the UK defaulted on war debt in amounts that exceeded 20
percent of their GDP in 1934. France and Britain retained their AAA status in the Fitch ratings; Moodys’
notched the UK down to Aa (from Aaa) and France remained at Aa. Also puzzling is how Greece and
Germany managed to retain a B rating from Moodys when both had defaulted on all debts in all creditors.
The Moody’s description of a C rating (Appendix Table B2) read “Obligations rated C are the lowest
rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery.” Perhaps there was optimism in their
recovery of principal or interest.

Beyond the ratings themselves, the usual important question on capital market access after a
default is somewhat moot in the context of the war debt defaults of 1934 or, more generally the
Depression. As Obstfeld and Taylor (1998) observe:35
“All evidence points to the latter part of the interwar period, the period of the Great Depression, as the
era of weakest financial integration: capital flows were small, countries behaved like closed economies in
the capital market, and real and nominal price (interest rate) differentials expanded.”
Turning to emerging markets, the Institutional Investor ratings (IIR), which are compiled twice a
year, are based on information provided by economists and sovereign risk analysts at leading global banks
and securities firms. The ratings grade each country on a scale from 0 to 100, with a rating of 100 given
to those countries perceived as having the lowest chance of defaulting on their government debt
obligations.36 Hence a transformed variable, (100 - IIR) can be interpreted as a proxy for default risk.
The first ratings were published in 1979, and hence provide coverage for the entire sample of emerging
market restructurings and defaults (although some of the smaller countries were added to the IIR sample
at a later date). In the most recent credit survey (March 2013) the average credit rating for 179 sovereign
fell 0.6 point to 43.9; the US credit rating fell 1.1 point to 88.8 its lowest level in the 33-year history of
the survey.
In Figure 3, the September rating year T is normalized to 1 and the average (solid line) and
plus/minus one standard deviation bounds (dashed line) are plotted for 30 of the 35 episodes for which
there is full data.37 The average increases in the IIR index are 22 percent after two years and 38 percent
after four years. The box inset to Figure 3 gives the number and share of countries for different ranges of
increases. For example, for 7 of the episodes (23 percent), the cumulative increase in the IIR from T to

the sample periods covered in this paper.
36
For details of the survey see http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Research/4142/Overview.html. Although not
critical to our analysis below, we interpret the ratings reported in each semiannual survey as capturing the near-term
risk of default within one to two years.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Dominica, Macedonia are not rated at all in the period surrounding the final
restructuring while the coverage for Seychelles is incomplete.

37

T+4 is in excess of 60 percent. This solid pattern of recovery is broadly consistent with the findings in
Gelos, Sahay, and Sandleris (2011), who define market access, “as public or publicly guaranteed bond
issuances or public or publicly guaranteed borrowing through a private syndicated bank loan that results
in an increase in the country’s indebtedness.” On the question of how long it takes countries to regain
market after an exit from defaults, they suggest that the median number of years it took countries to tap
the markets after default fell from four years in the 1980’s to zero in the 1990’s. Thus, re-entry seems to
typically occur within the four-year window explored here. The single lowest reading at T+4 was 0.89 for
Ecuador in the aftermath of the 1982 -1995 episode (there are 3 of the 30 cases, including Ecuador where
the rating was below what is was at the time of the restructuring). But this outcome was not because
Ecuador remained shut out of capital markets since its “final” Brady Plan restructuring but rather because
it was quick to re-leverage after the Brady restructuring and faced a new debt crisis in 1999-2000.38

The panorama presented by the Institutional Investor Ratings is consistent with the return of international
capital at the time of the final restructuring or in the four years following the final deal. In effect,
sometimes the return of international capital flows returns in a volume that was sufficiently large (relative
to the countries historical norm) that it would be considered a “capital inflow bonanza”, as in Reinhart
and Reinhart (2009). The dates of the bonanza episodes reported in that paper are available for 31 of the
35 episodes in this study; we found that 9 of 31 countries (29 percent) experienced bonanzas over T to
T+4. An additional 2 countries the surge in inflows began at T-1, bringing the share up to 39 percent.

restructuring reduce the debt? in this paper.

3. Servicing the debt
Another dimension to consider in evaluating the aftermath of debt relief or write-downs is its
impact on debt servicing burdens. To this end, we have compiled League of Nations data for the interwar
years on central government total debt service (interest payments plus amortizations for both domestic
and foreign public debt) for the advanced economies appearing in Table 1a, as well as for Germany and
the United States. Figure 4 presents the ratios of total debt service to both GDP (the dashed line plotted

39

against the right axis) and total central government revenue (solid line, left axis). 39 Between 1920 and
1931, both series display considerable volatility and no apparent trend. Beginning in 1931, which marks
the start of the Hoover Moratorium on war debt, until 1938 the series become less volatile and persistently
trend lower. France, Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom post the most significant declines in debt
servicing. While Figure 4 does not show the breakdown of total costs into interest payments and
amortization, our appraisal of the underlying data clearly places the lion’s share of the decline on
significant reductions in amortization. The debt servicing data may indeed be more revealing in these
1930s episodes than the outstanding debt stocks (which we examine next). The reason for this, is that
while some countries (Austria, for instance) immediately write the war debt off their books in 1934.
France having discontinued servicing war debt in 1932 removes it from its books six years later in 1938.
Others, like Belgium and the United Kingdom keep World War I debt in their official debt figures until
the end of World War II.

39

Long time series for central government revenues are taken from Mitchell (1998 and 2003), which in most cases
start in the 19th century (if not earlier).

Unlike the common (nearly so) default event in 1932-1934, the default spells, emerging market
default restructuring episodes are dispersed throughout 1978-2010. In Figure 5, we plot for the 1970-2011
The average debt service on total external debt (public plus private external debt), which was at the center
of the debt crises, especially in the 1980s. The chart shows debt servicing relative to gross national
income (GNI) a measure commonly used by the World Bank in their analytical work of debt and relative
to exports. The debt service/GNI measure is not plotted but summarized in the box inset, which break the
debt service into three sub-periods: three years before the initial year of default, the entire default spell
and three years follow T, the final restructuring or exit from default. The picture that emerges from both
series (more pronounced in debt service-to-exports ratio, which drops from 37 percent to 19 percent) is
one of a diminishing debt service burden relative to the pre-debt-crisis average. Debt servicing is
41

declining even before the “final restructuring” as in numerous cases (as discussed) there are multiple
restructuring efforts in between the start and end of the default spell. Also, there are periods of debt
standstills as well. However, this aggregate downward drift in debt servicing in emerging markets also
importantly owes to external factors. Specifically, as shown in Figure 5 (solid line, right scale), after an
abrupt spike in 1979 through mid-1982, there is a sustained and marked decline in real international
interest rates through 2011 importantly driven by developments in US monetary policy. Even in the
absence of haircuts, this beneficial trend would account for the observed reduction in debt servicing.

4. Did default or restructuring reduce the debt?
Governments usually get to the stage of debt restructuring and or default during hard times when
other policies and measures have been tried and proved inadequate, insufficient, unsustainable, or a
combination of these. A successful debt reduction package that marks an exit from a default regime apart
from reducing the burden of debt servicing, restoring capital market access and stimulating growth would
be expected to also to deliver some form of reduction in debt ratios that define whether the path is a
sustainable one or not. In many of the episodes studied here part of the “success” also involved changing
the composition of the debt. A common form of restructuring involves exchanges of short-term debt for
longer maturities or exchanges of marketable debt for nonmarketable instruments that pose lower rollover
risks. Analyzing to what extent these compositional change materialize is beyond the scope of this paper.
A compositional shift that was highly sought after in both the 1930s episodes and the modern
EMs is to shift exposure away from external debt. To that end, for the US and European episodes of the
1930s we use the long time series on total, domestic, external central government debt assembled in
Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and (2011).40 For the emerging markets, we study the evolution of total
external debt, which aggregates public, publicly guaranteed, and private debts. As many a crisis episode
has shown, private debts before the crises often morph into public debt after the crisis. 41
Table 5 documents changes in the stock of total, external and domestic debt for the period 1930 to
1934 and 1934 to 1937. We also calculate (not included in the table) the debt change over the entire 19301937 period. The cumulative reductions in debt as percent of GDP for France, Greece, and Italy are 50,
36, 30 percentage points, respectively. Sharp declines in external debt (where war debt figured
prominently) primarily account for this fast deleveraging.

40

If general government debt is used in the analysis it is so noted.
See Diaz-Alejandro (1985) for an early discussion of the contingent liabilities problem and Reinhart (2010) for
documenting numerous historical examples..

France in 1936 and Italy in 1935 (along with the Netherlands and Switzerland) exited
comparatively late from the gold standard; Italy and France had very limited scope to finance a fiscal
expansion through much of the Depression. Relative to the early exits from gold for Germany and the
United Kingdom in 1931, debt buildups in the 19 to 26 percent of GDP were recorded in 1930-1937 for
the UK, US and Germany. In five of the seven countries, total debt/GDP fell following the 1934 default
For the US the decline is marginal. France and Italy recorded the largest reductions, 59 and 22
percent, respectively. Germany and the United Kingdom recorded increases in total debt that were driven
by increases in domestic debt.
Table 6, presents a summary of external debt/exports for emerging market episodes. In the nineyear window we examine around the final restructuring episode, debt to exports falls, on average, by 74
percent. The larger decline occurs in T-4 to T. While this may appear counterintuitive, it is important to
remember that by the time that last restructuring is agreed upon, there had often been one or more prior
debt reduction efforts. Also, exits from default (T to T+4) are often accompanied or followed by new
bouts of borrowing, as capital market re-entry (as evidenced by the sharp improvement in sovereign
ratings following T).

In Figure 6 we compare the advanced economy and emerging market experience over T-4 to T+4.
For the emerging markets, we scale total external debt by gross national income (GNI). For the advanced
economies, we plot external (foreign) central government debt/GDP. T=1934 for the interwar default
episodes while T=last year (or exit) from restructuring/default spell for the emerging market entries.

46

The episodes are arranged from the largest deleveraging experiences to those cases, where
debt/GDP (or GNI) is highest four years after the exit from default. Red bars correspond to the advanced
economies; emerging markets are shown with green bars and (fewer) yellow bars. The latter are cases
where there is debt reduction over the 9-year period, but there is a significant debt buildup in the four
years following the final restructuring T to (T+4).
The first impression from Figure 6 is that there is a vast range in variation in the debt outcomes,
ranging from a cumulative debt reduction of 125 percent of GNI to a debt build-up of 37 percent of GNI.
Second, the number of countries, which experienced deleveraging is considerably higher (27 episodes)
than those ending up with a higher level of external debt (7 episodes).42 Third, it is evident that the
observations corresponding to the advanced economies are not clustered in a particular range and, indeed,
their experience is distributed similarly to that of emerging markets. Finally, there are three yellow bars
flagging countries where the deleveraging was done between T-4 and T and T to T+4 was a period of
considerable debt build. In two of the three cases, Argentina and Ecuador, the swift post crisis
deleveraging ended in a new default within less than a decade.

42

The US shows no change in external debt, as it does not have any external debt over this sample. Altogether this
brings the total number of advanced and emerging market episodes to 35.

V. Concluding Remarks
Elsewhere, we have documented that severe financial crises in advanced economies and emerging
markets share many similarities in terms of the severity, the macroeconomic effects and their frequent
connection with subsequent sovereign debt crises.43 Here, we have documented that the resolution of debt
overhangs in advanced and emerging market economies also have much in common even when they are
separated by more than half a century. Advanced economies in the 1930s, like many modern emerging
markets, also resorted to default and restructuring as part of their toolkit to deal with a massive debt
overhang in economic hard times. The magnitudes of debt relief delivered from the debt write offs are of
comparable magnitudes and, in most cases, quantitatively important (even by conservative estimates).
As to the aftermath of restructuring, the general picture that emerges is that, once the
restructuring is completed decisively, the economic panorama tends to improve in terms of growth, debt
servicing burdens, debt sustainability (higher growth lower debt), and international capital market access.
Both the advanced economy and emerging market sample provide evidence in this regard. Of course, the
critical modifier above is “completed decisively”. Ex post it is straightforward to date that final decisive
restructuring deal that ends the debt crisis spell. Ex-ante is another matter, as it is often difficult to
ascertain (given that the debt sustainability calculus is crucially driven by assumptions of future growth
and how quickly risk premia decline) whether a restructuring proposal will deliver that decisive outcome.
The defaults on World War I debt in the summer of 1934 were decisive in the full meaning that it
was understood that those debts would not be repaid anytime in the foreseeable future. Many, if not most,
of the emerging market episodes, however, had a high count of debt reduction efforts that were not
decisive; 97 restructuring deals in 35 defaults spells (a ratio of almost three to one) roughly suggests that
prior to a final restructuring there were two “insufficient” efforts. This process of trial and error is
typically associated with longer default spells and protracted slumps, as the empirical evidence presented

43

Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).

49

here shows. These observations are not meant to imply that the restructuring or default process is not
fraught with a variety of risks including reputational issues; it is meant to suggest that the “punishment” is
neither permanent nor even very persistent. In effect, exit from default has in a few cases been followed
by a renewed surge in borrowing culminating in a new debt crisis within a decade of the exit of the
previous crisis.
Our emphasis here on debt reduction via restructuring and default is not meant to suggest that
other forms of debt reduction were not quantitatively important in dealing with challenging debt
overhangs as well. Fiscal retrenchment, structural reform, financial repression, and (in the case of
domestic currency denominated debt) inflation often co-existed in these episodes of debt write-offs.
However, the magnitude of debt relief is usually sufficiently important to be integrated in an academic
autopsy or an ongoing policy discussion on the topic of debt overhang resolution.
It is beyond the scope of this paper to apportion to what extent the post-restructuring (or default
exit) improvement in the economy is attributable to debt relief per se and what role other factors may
have played. It would seem that this is a fruitful area for further investigation including revisiting the
interwar experience following the 1934 defaults and the recovery in six European economies and the US
that we studied here. Eichengreen (1992) has stressed the importance of stimulus provided by exits from
the gold standard. Yet, the exits from the gold were spread over a five-year period, from the early British
and Greek exits in 1931 to the French exit five years later in 1936. On the fiscal front, public works
programs were initiated throughout much of the 1930s, but as with monetary policy, there was
considerable dispersion in their timing and magnitudes. The defaults and debt write-downs were clustered
much more closely in 1932-1934 at the trough.
A parallel question for the emerging markets would involve sorting out to what extent the post
restructuring recovery may be linked to the debt write-downs or to other factors—such as the sharp
depreciations that accompany debt crises (Reinhart, 2002), as the latter may have been a force for
restoring competitiveness and stimulating exports. In any case, controlling for the stimulus from debt
50

relief seldom forms a part of the growth accounting following debt crisis episodes. Reinhart, Rogoff, and
Savastano (2003) suggested that for emerging markets at least restructurings played a prominent role in
historical periods of debt reduction (or debt reversals) in emerging markets. We would now suggest that
the preceding statement also accurately depicts the experience of the advanced economies in the interwar
years.

Devaluations details, Pick and Sedillot (1971), pg. 110; Nominal GDP, Measuring Worth, http://www.measuringworth.com/usgdp/
Notes: January 1934 devaluation details are: from 1 troy ounce of gold =20.67 US dollars to 1 troy ounce of gold = 35.00US dollars.
We provide the debt and nominal GDP figures for 1933 and 1934 to bracket the size of the debt reduction. According to
the League of Nations, the United States had no foreign currency debt in 1934, as such, there is no offsetting "cost"
from a higher burden of foreign currency debt following the devaluation. See also Kroszner (1999).

Table B2. Moody’s Global Long-Term Rating Scale
Rating

Explanation

Aaa

Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit
risk.

Aa

Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.

A

Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.

Baa

Baa Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and
as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.

Ba

Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.

B

B Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.

Caa

Obligations rated Caa are judged to be speculative of poor standing and are subject to very high
credit risk.

Ca

Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some
prospect of recovery of principal and interest.

C

Obligations rated C are the lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for
recovery of principal or interest.

Source: Moodys’ (2013).
Note: Moody’s appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa.
The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2
indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating
category. Additionally, a “(hyb)” indicator is appended to all ratings of hybrid securities issued by banks, insurers,
finance companies, and securities firms.*
* By their terms, hybrid securities allow for the omission of scheduled dividends, interest, or principal payments,
which can potentially result in impairment if such an omission occurs. Hybrid securities may also be subject to
contractually allowable write-downs of principal that could result in impairment.

Table B3. Fitch’s Ratings Symbols and Definitions
Rating

Explanation

AAA

Highest credit quality. AAA’ ratings denote the lowest expectation of default risk. They are assigned only in
cases of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be
adversely affected by foreseeable events.
Very high credit quality. ‘AA’ ratings denote expectations of very low default risk. They indicate very strong
capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.
High credit quality. ‘A’ ratings denote expectations of low default risk. The capacity for payment of financial
commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or
economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings.
Good credit quality. ‘BBB’ ratings indicate that expectations of default risk are currently low. The capacity for
payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more
likely to impair this capacity.
Speculative. ‘BB’ ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to default risk, particularly in the event of adverse
changes in business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial flexibility exists which
supports the servicing of financial commitments. .
Highly speculative. ‘B’ ratings indicate that material default risk is present, but a limited margin of safety remains.
Financial commitments are currently being met; however, capacity for continued payment is vulnerable to
deterioration in the business and economic environment.
Substantial credit risk. Default is a real possibility.
Very high levels of credit risk. Default of some kind appears probable.
Exceptionally high levels of credit risk. Default is imminent or inevitable, or the issuer is in standstill. Conditions
that are indicative of a ‘C’ category rating for an issuer include: a. the issuer has entered into a grace or cure period
following non-payment of a material financial obligation; b. the issuer has entered into a temporary negotiated
waiver or standstill agreement following a payment default on a material financial obligation; or c. Fitch Ratings
otherwise believes a condition of ‘RD’ or ‘D’ to be imminent or inevitable, including through the formal
announcement of a distressed debt exchange.
Restricted default. ‘RD’ ratings indicate an issuer that in Fitch Ratings’ opinion has experienced an uncured
payment default on a bond, loan or other material financial obligation but which has not entered into bankruptcy
filings, administration, receivership, liquidation or other formal winding-up procedure, and which has not
otherwise ceased operating. This would include: a. the selective payment default on a specific class or currency of
debt; b. the uncured expiry of any applicable grace period, cure period or default forbearance period following a
payment default on a bank loan, capital markets security or other material financial obligation; c. the extension of
multiple waivers or forbearance periods upon a payment default on one or more material financial obligations,
either in series or in parallel; or d. execution of a distressed debt exchange on one or more material financial
obligations.
Default. ‘D’ ratings indicate an issuer that in Fitch Ratings’ opinion has entered into bankruptcy filings,
administration, receivership, liquidation or other formal winding-up procedure, or which has otherwise ceased
business. Default ratings are not assigned prospectively to entities or their obligations; within this context, nonpayment on an instrument that contains a deferral feature or grace period will generally not be considered a default
until after the expiration of the deferral or grace period, unless a default is otherwise driven by bankruptcy or other
similar circumstance, or by a distressed debt exchange. “Imminent” default typically refers to the occasion where
a payment default has been intimated by the issuer, and is all but inevitable. This may, for example, be where an
issuer has missed a scheduled payment, but (as is typical) has a grace period during which it may cure the payment
default. Another alternative would be where an issuer has formally announced a distressed debt exchange, but the
date of the exchange still lies several days or weeks in the immediate future. In all cases, the assignment of a
default rating reflects the agency’s opinion as to the most appropriate rating category consistent with the rest of its
universe of ratings, and may differ from the definition of default under the terms of an issuer’s financial
obligations or local commercial practice.
