    "abstract": "\n\nWe introduce a new measure of a government's fiscal position that exploits cointegrating relationships among fiscal variables. The measure is a loglinear combination of tax revenue, government spending and the market value of government debt that\u2014unlike the debt-GDP ratio\u2014appears stationary in the US and 15 other developed countries. A weak fiscal position must ultimately be resolved by low future returns on government debt or by fiscal adjustment, a combination of high tax growth and low spending growth. Empirically, we find that debt returns play a negligible role and fiscal adjustment predominantly consists of changes in spending growth.\n\n",
