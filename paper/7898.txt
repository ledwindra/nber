It is a commonplace observation that the incentive to engage in creative activity depends
on the security of intellectual property rights. This observation, and the extensive literature
that analyses this dependence, presumes that the security of intellectual property rights is
largely a matter of public policy. This presumption justiÞes a modeling strategy that takes
the security of intellectual property rights to be exogenous with respect to creative activity.
The standard model abstracts from the decisions that people make to pirate ideas and to
guard ideas from pirating.
The present paper focuses on these decisions. In so doing it develops a model in which,
in contrast to the standard model, creative activity and the security of intellectual property
rights are jointly determined and the security of intellectual property rights is endogenous.
In this model potentially creative people choose either to engage in creative activity or to be
pirates, and people who are engaged in creative activity allocate their time and eﬀort between
creating ideas and guarding their ideas from pirating. The paper analyzes how these choices
are made and how both the value of ideas created as well as the security of intellectual
property rights that result from these choices depend on what I call the environment for
pirating.1 This environment reßects both the technology of pirating and social institutions,
such as patent law, copyright law, and their administration, that either impede or facilitate
pirating. The paper takes the environment for pirating as given.
This analysis deÞnes pirating to include any appropriation of the value of ideas created
by others, whether such appropriation involves the violation of patents and copyrights, as
in the case of pirated editions of books, or merely the creation of unauthorized imitations of
ideas, as in the case of “knock-oﬀs” of original designs. For simplicity, the analysis abstracts

Dan Usher (1987) developed a seminal model in which people decide whether to be producers or predators

and in which producers also decide how much time and eﬀort to put into guarding against predators. The
present analysis uses the basic structure of the models of producers and predators developed by Minseong
Kim and myself and summarized in Grossman (1998). For other examples of uses of this modeling structure,
see Grossman and Kim (2000[a], 2000[b]).

from diﬀerences among scientists, authors, composers, and artists, using the generic term
“inventors” to denote people who engage in creative activity. The analysis assumes that each
potentially creative person’s choice to be either an inventor or a pirate depends on whether
being an inventor or a pirate would yield more wealth for him (or her).
The guarding of ideas from pirating includes any costly activity that decreases the net
value of the ideas that inventors create, but also decreases the ability of pirates to appropriate
the value of these ideas. Ways of guarding ideas include everything from physically securing
the premises at which either creative activity takes place or ideas are implemented, to Þling
patents, to hiring lawyers to enforce patents and copyrights, to directing creative activity
to ideas that are intrinsically less readily pirated, even if these ideas are less valuable than
alternative ideas, to developing and implementing strategies, like encryption, that make
ideas harder to pirate. Each of these ways of guarding ideas requires either the direct use
of an inventor’s time and eﬀort or the spending of part of an inventor’s gross income on
hiring other people, such as lawyers. For simplicity the analysis abstracts from diﬀerent
ways of guarding ideas, assuming only that inventors allocate a fraction of their time and
eﬀort either directly or indirectly to guarding their ideas. With appropriate modiÞcations
of the modeling the analysis could be extended to consider speciÞc ways of guarding.
The paper begins by analysing a simple model in which each potentially creative person
is equally talented. This analysis shows how the choices made by potentially creative people
and the resulting value of ideas created and security of intellectual property rights depend
on the environment for pirating. The paper then extends the model by assuming that a
small fraction of the potentially creative people, the geniuses, are much more talented than
ordinary potentially creative people. The analysis of this extended model shows that, with
the existence of a small number of geniuses, a larger fraction of potentially creative people
choose to be pirates, and, consequently, intellectual property rights are less secure. But, the
analysis also reveals that, holding Þxed the average level of talent, the existence of a small
number of geniuses can result in a larger value of ideas being created.
2

The paper concludes by exploring the diﬀerence between the private value and the social
value of the security of intellectual property rights. This analysis shows that the amount
of time and eﬀort that inventors allocate to guarding their ideas results both in intellectual
property rights being too secure and in the value of ideas created being too small.
1. Potentially Creative People
Assume initially that each potentially creative person is equally talented. As already
explained, each person chooses to be either an inventor or a pirate. Let R denote the ratio
of pirates to inventors. The fraction of people who are pirates is R/(1 + R).
As also already explained, inventors allocate their time and eﬀort between creating ideas
and guarding these ideas. Let Ω denote the value of the ideas that each inventor could
create were he (or she) to allocate all of his (or her) time and eﬀort to creating ideas, and let
G denote the ratio of the time and eﬀort that an inventor allocates to guarding his ideas to
the time and eﬀort that he allocates to creating ideas. Assume further that the net value of
the ideas that an inventor creates equals Ω/(1 + G), which is the product of Ω and the
fraction of his time and eﬀort that he allocates to creating ideas.
Also, assume that the value of an idea that an inventor creates is independent of whether
or not pirates appropriate this idea. Accordingly, the pirating of an inventor’s ideas results
in a sharing of Ω/(1 + G) between the inventor and the successful pirates. To model this
sharing of the value of ideas, let p denote the fraction of the value of his ideas that an
inventor retains. Pirates appropriate the fraction 1 − p. In this model p measures the
security of intellectual property rights.
Appealing to a random matching story, assume that the larger is the number of pirates
relative to the number of inventors the more frequently will each inventor encounter a pirate.
Also assume that the more time and eﬀort that an inventor allocates to guarding his ideas
relative to time and eﬀort that he allocates to creating ideas the less likely is a pirate to be
successful in any encounter. Thus, p depends negatively on R and positively on G. To

3

incorporate this story into the analysis, assume speciÞcally that
(1)

p=

1
, where θ > 0.
1 + θR/G

In equation (1) the exogenous parameter θ quantiÞes the environment for pirating.
This parameter determines the eﬀectiveness of pirates in appropriating an inventor’s ideas
for given values of R and G.2 As mentioned above, the environment for pirating depends
both on technology and on social institutions.
The development of MP3 compression technology, which has facilitated the pirating of
music, is an example of a technological innovation that increased θ. An improvement in the
technology for encryption is an example of a technological innovation that would decrease
θ. An increase (or a decrease) in the eﬃciency of the bureaucracy and the courts that
administer the Þling and enforcement of patents would be an example of a social innovation
that would decrease (or increase) θ.
Let C denote the wealth of an inventor. Allowing for the fraction of the value of an
inventor’s ideas that pirates appropriate, we have
(2)

C=

pΩ
.
1+G

Let D denote the wealth of a pirate. To calculate D, observe that the value of the
ideas that pirates appropriate from each inventor is (1 − p)Ω/(1 + G). Assuming that each
pirate obtains an equal share of the total value of the ideas that pirates appropriate, D
equals the product of (1 − p)Ω/(1 + G) and the ratio of inventors to pirates. Thus, we have
(3)

2

D=

1−p Ω
.
R 1+G

Although equation (1) assumes, for simplicity, that for each inventor p depends only on R and his

own choice of G, it would be easy to extend the model to allow p for each inventor to depend either
positively or negatively on the values of G chosen by other inventors.

2. Inventors and Pirates
Consider Þrst the decision of each inventor to allocate a fraction of his time and eﬀort
to guarding his ideas. Taking R, the ratio of pirates to inventors, as given, each inventor
chooses the ratio G to maximize C. To analyse this choice problem we substitute equation
(1) into equation (2) and calculate the value of G that satisÞes the condition dC/dG = 0.
This condition implies that each inventor’s choice of G is such that
(4)

G=

√
θR.

Equation (4) says that, the better is the environment for pirating and the larger is the ratio of
pirates to inventors, the larger is the fraction of their time and eﬀort that inventors allocate
to guarding their ideas. In Figures 1 and 2 the concave locus represents equation (4).
Consider next the decision of a potentially creative person to be an inventor or a pirate.
To decide whether to be an inventor or a pirate, each potentially creative person compares
the values of C and D. In taking as given his potential wealth as an inventor or as a
pirate, each person implicitly takes as given the choices by other people to be inventors or
pirates, as reßected in R, and the fraction of their time and eﬀort that other inventors
allocate to guarding their ideas, as reßected in G. He knows that, if he chooses to be an
inventor, then he will allocate the same fraction of his time and eﬀort to guarding his ideas
as do other inventors.
Substituting equation (1) into equations (2) and (3), we Þnd that C is equal to or larger
than D as G is equal to or larger than θ. This relation between C and D implies that
the choices to be an inventor or a pirate are such that
(5)





R=


x ∈ [0, ∞] for G = θ
0

for G > θ.

Equation (5) says that, if G were equal to θ, then some fraction of the potentially creative
people would choose to be pirates, whereas, if G were larger than θ, then every potentially
5

creative person would choose to be an inventor. (The ratio of pirates to inventors is undeÞned
for G smaller than θ.) In Figure 1 the L shaped locus represents equation (5).
Solving equations (4) and (5) simultaneously, we Þnd that, with all potentially creative
people being equally talented, the equilibrium conÞguration of choices is
(6)

R = G = θ.

Figure 1 illustrates this equilibrium. With R equal to θ inventors choose G equal to θ,
and with G equal to θ each potentially creative person is indiﬀerent between being an
inventor and a pirate.
Equation (6) implies that the fraction θ/(1 + θ) of potentially creative people chooses
to be pirates and that inventors allocate the fraction θ/(1 + θ) of their time and eﬀort to
guarding their ideas.3 Substituting equation (6) into equation (1), we Þnd that the fraction
of the value of his ideas that an inventor retains is
(7)

p=

1
.
1+θ

Equation (7) implies that, with all potentially creative people being equally talented, intellectual property rights are less secure the larger is θ.
Finally, let Z denote the net value per capita of ideas created. In equilibrium, Z equals
the product of three factors: the fraction of people who choose to be inventors, the fraction
of their time and eﬀort that inventors allocate to creating ideas, and Ω. Using equation (6)
to calculate this product, we obtain
(8)
3

Z=

Ω
.
(1 + θ)2

By determining the equilibrium fraction of pirates, this analysis implies a probability with which a

potentially creative person chooses to be a pirate. But, the analysis does not tell us which people choose to
be pirates. In that sense, with all potentially creative people being equally talented, the model has multiple
equilibria.

6

Equation (8) implies that Z is smaller than Ω and that this shortfall in the value of ideas
created is larger the larger is θ.
Taking together, equations (6), (7), and (8) have the following implications:
With all potentially creative people being equally talented, the better is the environment for pirating, the smaller is the fraction of potentially creative people who
choose to be inventors, rather the pirates, and the larger is the fraction of their
time and eﬀort that inventors allocate to guarding their ideas. As a result, the
better is the environment for pirating, the smaller is the net value per capita of
ideas created. Also, the less secure are intellectual property rights.
3. Geniuses
This section introduces the assumption that a small fraction of the potentially creative
people, the geniuses, correctly perceive themselves to be much more talented than ordinary
creative people. Let E denote the ratio of geniuses to ordinary creative people, where E
is much smaller than one. The fraction of people who are geniuses is E/(1 + E). Let Ωo
denote the value of the ideas that each ordinary creative person could create, and let Ωe
denote the value of the ideas that each genius could create, where Ωe /Ωo is much larger
than one.4 Finally, let Ω denote the value of the ideas that the geniuses and the ordinary
potentially creative people on average could create, where
(9)
4

Ω=

E
1
Ωe +
Ωo .
1+E
1+E

In this formulation the perceived interpersonal distribution of talent has only two realizations, Ωo

and Ωe . Thus, in this model a potentially creative person has to know only these two numbers and
whether or not he is a genius. The analysis that follows would generalize readily to a model in which the
perceived interpersonal distribution of talent has a larger, but Þnite, number of realizations. The alternative
of specifying a continuous interpersonal distribution of talent is unappealing because it would require the
strong assumption that potentially creative people can Þnely perceive their talent levels on a continuum.

7

An important implication of equation (9) is that, for a given value of E, the larger is the
ratio Ωe /Ωo the larger are both the ratio Ω/Ωo and the ratio Ωe /Ω.
Let ve denote the fraction of people who are geniuses and who choose to be inventors,
where ve ≤ E/(1 + E), and let vo denote the fraction of ordinary creative people who
choose to be inventors, where vo ≤ 1/(1 + E). Thus, we have ve + vo + R/(1 + R) = 1,
where R again denotes the ratio of pirates to inventors.
Assume further that ordinary creative people have a comparative advantage as pirates.
To implement this assumption in a simple way, specify the environment for pirating such
that geniuses and ordinary creative people are equally eﬀective at pirating.5 This assumption
retains the speciÞcation in equation (1) according to which p depends on the ratio R, but
not on the identity of the pirates or inventors.
Let Ce denote the wealth of a genius who chooses to be an inventor, and let Co denote
the wealth of an ordinary creative person who chooses to be an inventor. Allowing for the
fraction of the value of ideas that pirates appropriate, we have
(10)

Ce =

p Ωe
,
1+G

Co =

p Ωo
.
1+G

and
(11)

Let D again denote the wealth of a pirate. Assuming that each pirate obtains an equal
share of the total value of the ideas that pirates appropriate, D equals 1 − p times the
value per capita of ideas created divided by the fraction of people who are pirates. Using
the result derived in the next paragraph that all inventors would choose the same value of
G, the value per capita of ideas created is (ve Ωe + vo Ωo )/(1 + G). Thus, we have
(12)
5

D=

(1 − p) ve Ωe + vo Ωo
.
R/(1 + R)
1+G

The analysis could be generalized by allowing geniuses to be better pirates than ordinary creative people,

as long as a person’s talent has a larger eﬀect on his ability to create ideas than on his ability as a pirate.

4. Geniuses and Pirates
Consider again the decision of each inventor to allocate a fraction of his time and eﬀort
to guarding his ideas. Taking R as given, each genius who chooses to be an inventor would
choose G to maximize Ce , and any ordinary creative person who would choose to be an
inventor would choose G to maximize Co . Accordingly, the choice of G by any inventor
√
again satisÞes equation (4), G = θR.
Next, consider again the decisions of potentially creative people to be an inventors or
pirates. To decide whether to be an inventor or a pirate, each genius compares the values of
Ce and D, and each ordinary creative person compares the values of Co and D. Again,
in taking as given his potential wealth as an inventor or as a pirate, each person implicitly
takes as given the choices by other people to be inventors or pirates, as reßected in R, and
the fraction of their time and eﬀort that other inventors allocate to guarding their ideas, as
reßected in G. He knows that, if he chooses to be an inventor, then he will allocate the
same fraction of his time and eﬀort to guarding his ideas as do other inventors.
Using equation (1) and equations (10) - (12) we Þnd that the choices of geniuses and
ordinary creative people to be inventors or pirates depend on G in the following way:
1. If D was equal to Ce and, hence, was larger than Co , then geniuses would have the
same wealth whether they chose to be inventors or pirates, whereas ordinary creative
people would have more wealth if they chose to be pirates. Hence, R would be either
equal to or larger than 1/E. Also, vo would equal zero, and, hence, ve would equal
1/(1 + R). Equations (1), (10), and (12) imply that this case would occur if and only
if G was equal to θ.
2. If D was smaller than Ce but still was larger than Co , then ordinary creative
people would have more wealth if they choose to be pirates, whereas geniuses would
have more wealth if they choose to be inventors. In this case, R would be equal
to 1/E. Also, again vo would equal zero, and, hence, ve would equal 1/(1 + R).
9

Equations (1) and (10)-(12) imply that this case could occur only if G was larger
than θ, but was smaller than θΩe /Ωo .
3. If D was smaller than Ce but was equal to Co , then ordinary creative people would
have the same wealth whether they choose to be inventors or pirates, whereas geniuses
would have more wealth if they choose to be inventors. Equations (1) and (10)-(12)
imply that this case could occur only if G was equal to or larger than θΩ/Ωo , but
was equal to or smaller than θΩe /Ωo . In this case, the equality between D and Co
would imply that R was equal to (G/θ − Ω/Ωo )/(Ω/Ωo − 1). This implied value of
R would be equal to or smaller than 1/E, but larger than or equal to zero.
4. If D was smaller than Co and, hence, also was smaller than Ce , then every person
would have more wealth if he chose to be an inventor. Equations (1), (11), and (12)
imply that this case could occur only if G was larger than θΩ/Ωo . In this case, R
would equal zero.

from equation (13), and G = θR, from equation (4).
If E is suﬃciently small and if Ωe /Ωo is suﬃciently large, then we can rule out all but
one of the possible equilibrium values for R given by equation (14). First, we see that, if
E is smaller than 1/θ, then the equilibrium value of R cannot be equal to θ and, hence,
cannot be larger than 1/E. This result says that, if the ratio of geniuses to ordinary creative
people is suﬃciently small, then in equilibrium all of the geniuses choose to be inventors.
Second, inspecting the quadratic equation of which R1 and R2 are the roots, we see
that, if Ωe /Ωo is suﬃciently large that Ω/Ωo is larger than

2, then

R1 and R2 do not exist as real numbers. In this case the equilibrium value of R cannot
be smaller than 1/E. This result says that, if the value of the ideas that each genius could
create is suﬃciently large relative to the value of the ideas that each ordinary creative person
could create, then in equilibrium all of the ordinary creative people choose to be pirates.
In sum, the equilibrium conÞguration of choices has the following property:
If the fraction of potentially creative people who are geniuses is suﬃciently small,
and if geniuses are suﬃciently talented relative to ordinary creative people, then
all of the geniuses choose to be inventors, and all of the ordinary creative people
choose to be pirates.
Hence, if E is suﬃciently small and if Ωe /Ωo is suﬃciently large, then we have
(15)

R = 1/E.

Furthermore, with R equal to 1/E, equation (4) implies that we have

5. Geniuses and the Net Value of Ideas Created
Comparing equations (15) and (16) with equation (6) we see that, with the existence of a
small fraction of geniuses, such that E is smaller than 1/θ, a larger fraction of potentially
creative people choose to be pirates, and inventors allocate a larger fraction of their time
and eﬀort to guarding their ideas. In addition, substituting equations (15) and (16) into
equation (1), we Þnd that with a small fraction of geniuses the fraction of the value of his
ideas that an inventor retains is

Comparing equation (17) with equation (7) we also see that with a small fraction of geniuses
intellectual property rights are less secure than with all potentially creative people being
equally talented.
Because geniuses choose to be inventors, and ordinary creative people choose to be pirates,
the wealth of every genius is equal to Ce , and the wealth of every ordinary creative person
is equal to D. Substituting for p from equation (17) and for R and G from equations
(15) and (16) into equations (10) and (12), we obtain

, then the value of Z given by equation

(20) is larger than value of Z given by equation (8).
Taken together, equations (17) and (20) have the following implications:
Holding Þxed the average level of talent, if geniuses are suﬃciently talented relative to ordinary creative people, then, although the existence of geniuses results in
intellectual property rights being less secure, the existence of geniuses also results
in a larger net value per capita of ideas being created.
To understand this result note that the existence of geniuses concentrates more of a given
average level of talent in the hands of people who choose to be inventors. Conversely, with
all of the pirates being ordinary creative people, each pirate wastes a smaller amount of
talent than with everyone, both pirates and inventors, having the same amount of talent.
If Ωe is suﬃciently large relative to Ωo , then this positive eﬀect outweighs the negative
eﬀects of fewer inventors and of the allocation a larger fraction of inventors’ time and eﬀort
to guarding their ideas.
Equation (20) also has two other interesting implications: First, because the set of pirates
coincides with the set of ordinary creative people, for a given value of [E/(1 + E)]Ωe , Z is
larger the larger is E, as long as E remains smaller than 1/θ. The result obtains because,
with a larger fraction of somewhat less talented geniuses and, hence, with a smaller fraction
of pirates, the inventors allocate a smaller fraction of their time and eﬀort to guarding their
ideas. Second, even though with E smaller than 1/θ the ratio of pirates to inventors does
not depend on θ,

Z is larger the smaller is θ. This result obtains because the better is
13

the environment for pirating the larger is the fraction of their time and eﬀort that inventors
allocate to guarding their ideas.
6. Are Intellectual Property Rights Too Secure?
In the equilibrium that we have analysed, geniuses choose to be inventors, ordinary
creative people choose to be pirates, and each inventor, taking the ratio of pirates to inventors
as given, allocates the fraction of his time and eﬀort to guarding his ideas that maximizes his
wealth, Ce . The result is that inventors choose G equal to

q

θ/E, as given by equation

(16), and that the net value per capita of ideas created, Z, is given by equation (20).
It is interesting to compare the solution to each inventor’s problem of choosing G to
maximize Ce to the solution to the hypothetical problem of choosing G to maximize
the net value per capita of ideas created. These solutions are not necessarily the same. In
fact, we might conjecture that the value of G that each inventor chooses is either larger or
smaller than the value of G that, if chosen by all of the inventors, would maximize Z.
First, observe that individual inventors, in taking the ratio of pirates to inventors as
given, ignore the fact that, if all of them were to make ideas suﬃciently hard to pirate, then
ordinary creative people would be deterred from being pirates. This observation suggests
that the value of G that each inventor chooses is smaller than the value of G that, if
chosen by all of the inventors, would maximize Z. In other words, we might conjecture that
the social value of guarding ideas is larger than its private value.
To explore this conjecture, we see from equation (13) and Figure 2 that, if G were
suﬃciently large – more precisely, if G were larger than θΩe /Ωo which is a larger value of
G than individual inventors choose – then all of the potentially creative people, including
the ordinary creative people, would choose to be inventors rather than pirates. Accordingly,
suppose that G were equal to (1 + ²)θΩe /Ωo , where ² is an arbitrarily small number.
This value of G is the smallest value for which R would unambiguously equal zero. With
R equal to zero, p would equal one, and intellectual property rights would be perfectly

14

secure.6 In addition, with R equal to zero, Z would equal the product of the fraction of
time and eﬀort that inventors allocate to creating ideas and the value of the ideas that the
geniuses and the ordinary creative people on average could create. Thus, with G equal to
(1 + ²)θΩe /Ωo , we would have
(21)

Z=

Ω
.
1 + (1 + ²)θΩe /Ωo

Comparing equation (21) with equation (20), we see that, if Ωe /Ωo is suﬃciently large,
then the value of Z given by equation (21) is smaller than the value of Z given by equation
(20). This result obtains because, with geniuses being much more talented than ordinary
creative people, Ω in equation (21) would be only a little larger than [E/(1 + E)]Ωe
in equation (20), whereas θΩe /Ωo in equation (21) would be much larger than

q

θ/E

in equation (20). In other words, the increase in the potential value of ideas created from
inducing ordinary creative people to be inventors rather than pirates would be small, whereas
the fraction of their time and eﬀort that inventors would have to allocate to guarding their
ideas would be large. This analysis has the following implication:
If geniuses are suﬃciently talented relative to ordinary creative people, then the
social value of guarding ideas is not larger than its private value. Although, by
allocating suﬃciently more time and eﬀort to guarding ideas than each inventor
chooses, it would be possible to make ideas hard enough to pirate that intellectual
property rights would be perfectly secure, such an increase in time and eﬀort
allocated to guarding would decrease the net value per capita of ideas created.
Now consider the alternative possibility that the private value of guarding ideas is larger
than its social value. Observe that the wealth of an inventor depends not only on the value
6

We also could have R equal to zero for values of G as small as θΩ/Ωo . But, values of G not larger

than θΩe /Ωo would not be uniquely associated with R equal to zero. In addition, because Ω/Ωo is larger
the larger is Ωe /Ωo , the implications of Ωe /Ωo being large would apply even if we associated R equal to
zero with values of G as small as θΩ/Ωo .

of the ideas that he creates but also on the fraction of that value that he retains. This
observation suggests that the value of G that each inventor chooses is larger than the value
of G that, if chosen by all of the inventors, would maximize Z.
From equation (13) and Figure 2, we see that, for any value of G larger than θ, all of
the geniuses would choose to be inventors, just as in the equilibrium in which inventors are
maximizing their wealth. Accordingly, suppose that G were equal to (1 + ²)θ. If E is
smaller than 1/θ, then (1 + ²)θ is smaller than

q

θ/E, which is the value of G that

individual inventors choose. Thus, with G equal to (1 + ²)θ, p would be smaller, and
intellectual property rights would be less secure, than in the equilibrium in which inventors
are maximizing their wealth. But, the set of inventors still would coincide with the set of
geniuses. Furthermore, each inventor would allocate a larger fraction of his time and eﬀort
to creating ideas.
Accordingly, with G equal to (1 + ²)θ, the net value per capita of ideas created would
be larger than with G equal to what individual inventors choose. SpeciÞcally, with G
equal to (1 + ²)θ, we would have
(22)

Z=

Ωe
.
1 + E 1 + (1 + ²)θ

The important observation here is that, if E is smaller than 1/θ, then the value of Z
given by equation (22) is larger than the value of Z given by equation (20). This analysis
has the following implication:
If the fraction of potentially creative people who are geniuses is suﬃciently small,
then inventors allocate a larger fraction of their time and eﬀort to guarding their
ideas than the fraction that would maximize the net value per capita of ideas
created. With less time and eﬀort allocated to guarding ideas, although intellectual
property rights would be less secure, the net value per capita of ideas created would
be larger than in an equilibrium in which inventors are maximizing their wealth.

7. Summary
This paper has analysed the interaction between the choices of potentially creative people
to be either inventors or pirates and the decisions of inventors to allocate time and eﬀort to
guarding their ideas. We have seen how both the net value of ideas created as well as the
security of intellectual property rights depend in equilibrium on the environment for pirating
and on the interpersonal distribution of talent. The analysis also recognized the diﬀerence
between the private value and the social value of the security of intellectual property rights.
We can brießy summarize the main results of the analysis as follows:
1. If the fraction of potentially creative people who are geniuses is suﬃciently small, and
if geniuses are suﬃciently talented relative to ordinary creative people, then all of the
geniuses choose to be inventors, and all of the ordinary creative people choose to be
pirates.
2. The better is the environment for pirating, the smaller is the net value per capita of
ideas created. Also, the less secure are intellectual property rights.
3. The existence of geniuses results in intellectual property rights being less secure. But,
holding Þxed the average level of talent, if geniuses are suﬃciently talented relative
to ordinary creative people, then the existence of geniuses also results in a larger net
value per capita of ideas being created.
4. If the fraction of potentially creative people who are geniuses is suﬃciently small, then
from a social standpoint each inventor allocates too much of his time and eﬀort to
guarding his ideas. The net value per capita of ideas created would be larger in a
hypothetical situation in which intellectual property rights were less secure than in an
equilibrium in which inventors are maximizing their wealth.
