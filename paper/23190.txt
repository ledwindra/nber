Prolonging Coal’s Sunset: The Causes and Consequences of Local Protectionism for a Declining
Polluting Industry

ABSTRACT
In recent years, the share of U.S electricity generated by coal has fallen from nearly 50% to 33%.
The costs of this transition are spatially concentrated, and mining states have already lost income
due to the reduced demand for coal. Coal states have enacted policies to encourage local power
plants to purchase from within state mines. We document that power plants in states and counties
with substantial mining activity are more likely to be coal fired and to purchase more within
political boundary coal. These results are robust to including flexible controls for the distance
from power plants to mines. While coal states benefits from local protectionism, these efforts
impose social costs because coal mining and coal burning creates significant environmental
consequences. We quantify these effects and find that a one-percentage point increase in the
proportion of coal plants in a NERC region with an in-state coal mine results in approximately
2.3 million additional annual tons of CO2 emissions.

Introduction
To mitigate the global challenge of climate change, nations must burn less coal. In recent
years, the share of U.S electricity generated by coal has fallen from nearly 50% to 33%. The U.S
reduction in coal use for generating power is especially notable because it has occurred without
the U.S imposing carbon pricing or a carbon tax (Cragg et. al. 2013). The substitution away from
coal is mainly due to the rise of the adoption of fracking technology and some states sharply
ratcheting up their renewable portfolio standards (Venkatesh et al 2012 and Burtraw et al, 2012).
While competition from natural gas is unlikely to abate, changes in policies such as opening
additional federal lands to coal mining or rolling back carbon dioxide emissions standards on
new coal plants threaten to reverse or slow this trend.
While environmentalists cheer for coal’s sunset, there are interest groups with strong
incentives to protect this declining industry. Reduced power plant demand for coal imposes
spatially concentrated costs borne by traditional coal mining communities in states such as West
Virginia, Kentucky, and Wyoming, and the low skill workers who engage in mining and
providing services in mining areas. There were 261 coal mines in the United States that shipped
coal to the electricity sector in 2014. These mines are located in rural areas where the population
is white and has less education. Workers in these regions have fewer alternative job prospects.
Their local economies experience slower economic growth and lower productivity than the rest
of the nation (Islam, Minier, and Ziliak 2015 and Bollinger, Ziliak, and Troske 2011).
In this paper, we document that power plants are more likely to use coal to generate
power and are more likely to purchase locally mined coal if the power plant and the coal mine
are located in the same state, county, or congressional district. This finding is robust to flexibly
controlling for the distance between mines and power plants. Using a county border pairs
research design, we further test the robustness of this finding.
A distinctive feature of the coal industry is that its consumption and production entails
large Pigouvian externalities (Davis 2011, Mueller and Mendelsohn 2012). In such a case, local
protectionism causes two inefficiency losses. First, there is the usual deadweight loss from not
exhausting the gains to trade between demanders and low cost suppliers. Second, there is
2

deadweight loss caused by prolonging the use of a dirty technology that causes social harm. By
supporting local coal mines, the transition to natural gas and renewable electricity sources is
slowed and this results in additional emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria air pollutants.
Since climate change is a global externality, local and state elected leaders have weak
incentives to internalize this externality. Instead, they have strong incentives to protect local coal
mines as this improves the local economy through providing high-paying jobs as well as
indirectly through the local spending multiplier. We study the environmental implications of this
local protectionism for local air quality and overall CO2 emissions. By quantifying the social
costs associated with protection of a declining industry, this piece of our empirics is the mirror
opposite of other research that attempts to measure the social benefits of protecting infant
industries (see Goodstein 1995). This literature argues that society ostensibly props up infant
industries because they convey a social good (Melitz 2005).
In the last section of the paper, we explore possible mechanisms for our core finding of
“excess” within state coal trade between power plants and mines. We argue that local politicians
have strong incentives to engage in protecting local coal interests. Coal states provide large
financial incentives to encourage local coal purchases. West Virginia provides incentives that
reduce the production cost for local coal mines and encourages local buyers to buy from these
sellers. Maryland and Virginia offer a $3 per ton tax credit for utilities buying in-state coal
(Bowen and Deskins 2015). Oklahoma offers credits of $5 per ton to both coal mines and power
plants, effectively contributing $10 to every ton of Oklahoman coal that is burned for electricity
generation in the state. Both Oklahoma and Illinois have enacted laws aimed at forcing power
plants to purchase their coal from in-state mines rather than cheaper coal from Wyoming. We
also present alternative mechanisms that lead to increased local demand for coal.
The Spatial Economics of Coal Trading
We present a simple framework for studying bilateral trade between power plants and
coal mines. Consider the case where coal is produced by a set of spatially-differentiated mines
using a homogeneous production function, and converted into electricity using a homogeneous
production function by power plants that seek to minimize their cost of production subject to
3

generating a given level of electricity.1 Further, suppose there are no long-term contracts such
that coal is sold on a spot market.
Given these assumptions, we expect that a “gravity model” of bilateral trade will have
significant explanatory power (Lee and Swagel 1997). If coal markets are competitive, power
plants will purchase coal from the closest mine, at a price that is at most equal to the production
price of coal plus the transportation cost from the second closest mine. If a power plant
purchases from a mine that is not its closest prospective trading partner, it is indicative of
deviation from perfect competition.2
The cost of coal transportation is a substantial portion of total coal generation costs.
Shipping coal by rail – the predominant transportation method – generally costs on the order of
2-8 cents per ton per mile, so each additional 100 miles of transportation increases the delivered
price of coal by $2-$8 per ton. Given that coal prices are generally below $50 per ton, power
plants have a substantial incentive to purchase coal from close mines. These costs are a
significant portion of total operating costs for a coal-fired power plant. Based on EIA reports of
average operating expenses and average heat input for coal-fired power plants, the transportation
costs of moving coal 100 miles would account for about 0.2 cents per kWh, around 5% of total
operating expenses.3 In 2012, the median power plant purchased 960,000 tons of coal while the
median coal mine delivered nearly 1.2 million tons of coal.
Figure One maps the 372 coal fired power plants in the United States and the 161 coal
mines in the U.S that either purchased coal in 2014 or shipped coal to the electricity sector in
2014. Several clear geographic patterns emerge. Coal mining is concentrated in Appalachia
(Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania), in southern Illinois and Indiana, and in
Wyoming. While the majority of mines are in the Appalachia region, the largest mines are in
In reality, even publicly-owned utilities that own their own power plants should purchase from other
power plants if the electricity can be provided at lower cost.
2
Neither coal production nor electricity generation technologies are homogenous, of course, and other
considerations such as uncertainty about mine production, could lead power plants to seek out more
distant trading partners.

EIA quotes 3.904 cents per kwh for fossil steam plants in 2014 and 0.00052 tons of coal per kwh. We
assume a transportation cost of $4 per 100 miles, the midpoint of our range.

Wyoming, which has relatively low-quality but easily accessible coal deposits with low sulfur
content. Coal power plants exist throughout the country, but are most prevalent in the Midwest,
Mid Atlantic, and South. For each power plant, we calculate the Euclidean distance to the coal
mines with which it trades. Table 1 reports the empirical distribution of these distances where we
weight the observations by the quantity of coal the power plant consumed in 2014. We find that
30% of total power plant coal is purchased from mines that are less than 80 miles away.

The Empirical Strategy
We examine the effects of political boundaries on the trading patterns of pairs of power
plants and coal mines. We examine the likelihood of trading, prices and contract characteristics,
and the placement and potential closure of coal fired power plants. In each case, our key
hypotheses focus on the coefficient estimates for our border variables. Our identification strategy
relies on the assumption that our flexible controls for distance capture any affect associated with
transportation costs between power plants and mines.
Our sunset hypothesis posits that all else equal, there will be more coal trade when the
buyer and seller are in the same jurisdiction, and that the contractual lock-in will be stronger.
This econometric strategy combines the standard trade gravity model with Holmes’ (1999)
borders approach. In a later section, we will report tests of heterogeneous treatment effects along
a number of dimensions.
The distinctive feature of our econometric framework is the vector of dummy variables
indicating if the origin mine and potential destination power plant share a common political
jurisdiction. Power plants and mines that are within the same jurisdiction are, of course,
relatively close to each other and have lower transportation costs than power plants that are far
away. By explicitly controlling for the distance between power plants and mines, our political
jurisdiction variable compares the likelihood of buying coal from an in-state mine relative to a
similarly distance out-of-state mine.
Coal Purchases and Quantities
5

We estimate a series of regressions to test the hypothesis that coal trading varies across
political boundaries in ways beyond what would be predicted by a gravity model. In each case,
our linear index of interest is given in equation (1)
𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝐴 + 𝑔(𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝐵1 ∗ 𝐵𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝐵2 ∗ 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑡 +
𝐵3 ∗ 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑒 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑗𝑡 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝑈𝑖𝑗𝑡

(1)

and we vary the definition of the dependent variable Y to reflect different dimensions along
which coal mines and power plants interact. The subscript i denotes the power plant, j denotes
the mine, and t denotes the year. In equation (1), the key explanatory variables of interest are the
vector of border dummies. We include three dummies indicating whether the mine and the plant
are located in the same state, same Congressional District and same county. A key point to note
is that we flexibly model the role of distance on trade. This g() polynomial, splines, and distance
bins that we report below allow us to flexibly control for proxies for transportation costs.4
In our first set of results, the dependent variable is a dummy variable, 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑡 , that
equals one if power plant i trades with mine j in year t. We estimate the probability of 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑡
in a logistic regression, assuming that 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 1 𝑖𝑓 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑡 > 0.
Similarly, we estimate OLS versions of equation (1) in which the dependent variable Yijt
is defined as 𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑡 , the amount of coal in tons that is traded between each power plant and
mine combination. We estimate this model using both the full sample of possible power plant
mine combinations as well as a restricted model in which we focus on quantity behavior among
only those combinations in which a trade takes place.5
A Border Pairs Test
One potential concern is that our cross-political boundary results might merely be the
effect of non-linear distance effects that are not captured by our distance controls. In order to
In the Web Appendix, we estimate the relationship between distance and the EIA-reported
transportation costs between states. Distance and year fixed effects result in an adjusted R-Squared of
between 0.35 and 0.64 depending on the distance specification.

In the Web Appendix, we also estimate a Heckit version of equation (1) to study the joint determinants
of whether a trade occurs and the quantity given that a trade takes place.

address this concern, we estimate the effect of the political boundary on coal trading in a border
pairs framework in the spirit of Black (1999) and Holmes (1998). Following Dube, Lester, and
Reich (2010), we rely on controls for contiguous counties that are in different states to better
control for unobserved characteristics of power plant locations that could bias our estimates of
the cross state effect. Our approach relies on the typical continuity assumption that
characteristics on either side of a boundary are the same. Under this assumption, the effect of the
border can be treated as randomly assigned. In our case, we assume that power plants in counties
on either side of a state border are otherwise comparable and then estimate the causal effect of
crossing the border on the probability that a mine buys coal from a power plant.
Following Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010), we limit our sample to only counties along
state borders that are adjacent to a county in another state that also has a coal-fired power plant.
There are 69 counties that both have a coal-fired power plant and are adjacent to a county in a
different state that also has a coal fired power plant and a total of 89 unique county boundary
pairs (some counties appear in more than one pair). There are 105 power plants in these 69
counties. Figure 2 shows the set of power plants in this sample.
We create a set of adjacent county fixed effects for each pair of cross-state adjacent
counties. Each pair of adjacent-county power plants receives a unique fixed effect. For example,
there are two power plants in Clark County, Nevada and one power plant in neighboring San
Bernardino County, California. Each of the three power plants receives a value of one for the
Clark County-San Bernardino County dummy variable and all other power plants in the country
receive a zero for this fixed effect. If a county borders two neighboring-state counties with a
power plant, plants in that county would receive a one for the fixed effects corresponding to each
county pairs. When we consider the likelihood that some mine in, for example, Nevada sells coal
to each of these plants, the county pair specific fixed effect captures the characteristics of the
region and the difference in the probability of transaction between the Nevada plants and the
California plant is driven by the state border.
In order to implement this strategy, we modify equation (1) to reflect the addition of these
bordering county fixed effects as

7

𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑝𝑡 = 𝛥𝑝 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝑔(𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝐵1 ∗ 𝐵𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝐵2 ∗
𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑡 + 𝐵3 ∗ 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑒 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑗𝑡 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝑈𝑖𝑗𝑝𝑡 (2)
Note that this new regression differs from equation (1) because we now restrict the set of
observations we include in the regression and we also include a set of 𝛥𝑝 county border fixed
effects. Initially, we do not restrict the set of coal mining counties with which a power plant can
trade, so for each of our 105 power plants we observe 400 potential trading partners in each year.
We again estimate a logistic regression of the probability that a mine and a power plant trade in a
given year as determined by 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑝𝑡 = 1 𝑖𝑓 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑝𝑡 > 0.
Next, we further restrict the sample so that each power plant can only buy coal from
mines in its own state or in its adjacent county’s state. Figure 3 shows the set of cross-state
power plant pairs in Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Indiana, as well as the mines in each of
these states. Each of the power plants along the Ohio-West Virginia border have a choice set of
coal mine trading partners of Ohio or West Virginia mines. Similarly, each of the power plants
along the Indiana-Kentucky border have a choice set of coal mine trading partners of Indiana and
Kentucky mines. As in the unrestricted border pairs framework, each pair of adjacent counties
receives a fixed effect to control for unobserved regional variation. By limiting our sample to
only those mines that could be in-state trading partners for at least one of the power plants in a
pair, we ensure that each mine has at least one in-state potential trading partner and at least one
out-of-state potential trading partner to serve as a counterfactual.
Price and Contract Characteristics
In our next set of empirical results, we examine several of the characteristics of trades. In
this analysis, we restrict our study to only trades, rather than all possible power plant-mine
interactions because trade characteristics like price and contracting status cannot be observed for
trades that did not occur. We also focus on a monthly time-scale (the sharpest time-step reported
in our data) rather than an annual time-scale to avoid issues associated with aggregating prices
and contract characteristics over months in a year. In this regression, we first estimate a version
of equation (1) but the dependent variable in this case is the price of coal in dollars per MMBTU
from a power plant to a mine.
8

We then estimate two models regarding the contractual characteristics of powerplantmine interactions. Joskow (1985) notes the importance of relationship-specific capital in the coal
market, with larger quantity contracts tending to be longer duration contracts. As a corollary, we
look for the presence of relationship-specific political capital in coal trades, expecting that plantmine pairs in which political capital is prevalent or more important will be more likely to lock
into long-term contracts than plant-mine pairings in which political capital does not exist.
Similarly, coal mines that have guaranteed a level of demand by entering into long lasting
contracts will be more likely to hire or retain workers than plants that have not guaranteed
trading partners. We estimate two modified versions of equation (1). In the first case, we
estimate a logistic regression for whether or not a trade was governed by a contract. In the
second case, we estimate a Poisson model in which the dependent variable is the number of
months a contract extends following an observed contracted coal purchase.
Power Plant Placement and Closures
Our gravity model estimates depend on the fact that a power plant is open at a point in
time and located at a given location. These two decisions are choices and may thus be affected
by access to coal mines. If coal plants are placed in coal mining jurisdictions more frequently
than market forces would imply, our estimates of coal mines’ effect on local coal demand will be
an underestimate of the full power exerted by mining interests.
To study the locational choice of power plants and their choice over whether to close, we
estimate a multinomial logit of whether a county has a coal-fired power plant, a non-coal fired
power plant, or no power plants as a function of whether or not the county has an in-state or incounty coal mine. We assume that for a county, i, the index associated with each of these three
power plant placement decisions is given as specified in equation (3).
𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑖 = 𝐵1 ∗ 𝐼𝑛 𝐽𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑖 + 𝐵2 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑖 + 𝐵3 ∗
𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 + 𝑈𝑖 .

(3)

We control for the Euclidean distance between the county centroid and the closest coal
mine. As a result, our political boundary effects are estimated holding constant the cost
associated with moving coal from the closest mine to the power plant. Because power plants are
9

often located near population centers, we include the county’s population in the power plant
siting decision.
Competition from natural gas has led to substantial reductions in coal-fired electricity
capacity over the past decade. We examine the universe of coal-fired generators and estimate the
likelihood that a generator is retired by 2014 as a function of whether or not the generator has an
in-state coal mine.6 We estimate a logit regression for whether or not a generator is retired in our
sample as 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖 = 1 𝑖𝑓 𝑌𝑖 > 0 where
𝑌𝑖 = 𝐵1 ∗ 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖 + 𝐵2 ∗ 𝐼𝑛 𝐽𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑖 + 𝐵3 ∗
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑒 𝑖 + 𝑈𝑖

(4)

If the coefficient on our In Jurisdiction Mine coefficient is less than zero, power plants with an
in-state coal mine are less likely to retire than plants without an in-state coal mine, even after
controlling for the distance to the geographically closest potential trading partner.
Power Plant and Mine Data
In this study, our main unit of analysis will be a coal mine’s trading with each power
plant in each year. The EIA collects data on fuel deliveries to the plants in the power sector.
Since 2008, fuel deliveries have been collected on the EIA-923 form, which covers monthly fuel
deliveries by both utilities and non-utility deliveries. Between 2002 and 2008, utility fuel
deliveries were reported through the FERC-423, while non-utility deliveries were collected via
survey with the EIA-423 for plants in excessive of 50 MW. Prior to 2002, only the FERC-423
existed, and collected only utility fuel purchases.
Since the earlier data do not report the mine-specific MSHA ID, we treat a mine’s
location as the mine’s county of origin, which is reported much more consistently and aggregate
coal deliveries to the plant-coal county-year (aggregating across months in the year). We then
construct a data set containing 5,289,000 rows. Our unit of analysis is a coal mine/power
plant/year. In our data set, there are 410 coal mine counties, 516 power plants and 25 years
(1990-2014) in our sample. For each mining county, we calculate the latitude and longitude of

The EIA reports retirements at the generator-level rather than the plant-level.

the county centroid and compute the distance between the county centroid and each power plant.
Finally, we calculate the total annual quantity of coal that is shipped for each county and the total
annual quantity of coal that is received for each power plant and drop plant-coal county-year
observations in which the plant received no coal or the coal county shipped no coal. This leaves
1.9 million observations from the initial matrix of 5.2 million plant-mine-year combinations. We
supplement the EIA/FERC data with additional power plant-specific characteristics such as the
utility type of the power plant operator (e.g. municipally-owned, investor-owned, independent
power producer, etc).
In the recent EIA sample (2008-2014), characteristics of the delivered coal are also
reported for each transaction. These characteristics include the price of the delivered cost of coal,
as well as the ash, sulfur, and heat content for the fuels. The more recent data also report
characteristics of the trade such as whether or not the trade occurred pursuant to a contract and
the duration of any contracts. This sample also contains the mine-specific MSHA ID of each coal
mine rather than only the county of origin. We exploit the increased precision of coal mine
locations in this data and compute the distance between each mine (rather than the county
centroid of the mine) and each power plant based on the reported latitudes and longitudes of each
mine and plant. We then overlay state, county, and congressional boundary shape files onto our
geospatial data on power plant and coal county/mine location and create indicator variables for
whether a power plant – coal county/mine combination are in the same state, county, or
congressional district.
Results on Coal Trading
Table 2 reports estimates of equation (1) and shows that coal purchases are generally
local. Columns 3 and 4 show the percentage of coal deliveries to power plants in each state that
were from in-state and out-of-state coal mines, respectively. Columns 5 and 6 show the
percentage of coal deliveries from mines in each state that were to in-state and out-of-state power
plants, respectively. Columns 4 and 5 are blank if a state does not have any coal mines that
shipped to the power sector throughout the duration of our sample.
The average state receives 24% of its total coal consumption from in-state mines,
although this is biased downward because many states do not produce coal at all and must
purchase all of their coal from out-of-state mines. The average across only the states that produce
11

coal is 48%. The states that receive the lowest-percentage of total coal purchases from in-state
mines were Kansas (20), Maryland (24), Missouri (29), Oklahoma (40) and Tennessee (47). In
each of these states, coal is the dominant source of electricity generation but coal mining is a
relatively small industry.
Coal Purchases and Quantities Results
The prevalence for intra-state trades is not driven merely by distance. Across each
distance specification, we consistently find a positive and statistically significant effect of being
within state lines on the probability that a power plant will purchase coal from a mine. Table 3
presents these results. A power plant is 0.3 percentage points more likely to purchase coal from
an in-state mine than from an out-of-state mine that is the same distance away. This effect is
quite large in context. Across our entire sample, the probability that a plant-mine combination
engages in a trade in a given year is about 2 percent. We find even stronger effects at the county
boundary. Intra-county trades are approximately 2 percentage points more likely to occur than
inter-county trades. The effect of the congressional district is comparable in magnitude to the
effect of the state boundary. These effects are consistent regardless of the approach to controlling
for transportation distance using either polynomials or a restricted cubic spline. Using the 10mile bins – the finest granularity of distance control – the state effect is reduced slightly. Mines
and power plants that share a state are 0.2 percentage points more likely to trade than those that
are in different states. The effect of the county boundary is reduced by an order of magnitude,
and the statistical significance is weaker for both the county and congressional boundary
estimates. Also, note the relationship between the political boundaries. A mine that is in the same
county and congressional district as a power plant is obviously in the same state as well, so the
net effect is the sum of the three coefficients.
The probability that a power plant and a mine trade is increasing in both power plant
purchases and in mine shipments. This indicates that plants that buy a lot of coal tend to purchase
from more mines than plants that buy a relatively small amount of coal. Similarly, mines that
produce a lot of coal sell to more power plants than small mines.
We find similar results when we examine the joint distribution of a trade occurring and
the amount of coal that is purchased. These results are reported in Table 4. A power plant will
12

buy approximately 8,000 more tons of coal from an in-state mine than it would buy from an outof-state mine of comparable distance. The effect of the congressional border is approximately
100,000 tons, around eight times the magnitude of the cross-state effect. The effect of the county
border is substantial; a mine will buy 1.4 million more tons of coal from an in-county power
plant than it would buy from an out-of-county power plant. In each case except the cross-state
effect in the splined distance control and the state and congressional boundary effect in the tenmile bins, the estimates are strikingly similar across distance controls.
We also estimate the effect of political boundaries on the intensive margin of coal
trading. Table 5 presents the regression results for this specification. Only the intra-county effect
persists on the intensive margin, except in the case where we include the ten-mile bins where we
find suggestive evidence that plants buy more from cross-state mines than in-state mines.
Surprisingly, the magnitude of the effect is only slightly smaller than the case in which we
consider the quantity in all observations.
Border Pairs Results
Our border pair models presented in Tables 6 and 7 report further evidence of political
boundary effects in coal purchasing. In estimating equation (2), we include all mines as potential
trading partners, each of the 105 power plants in the 69 counties that both have a coal-fired
power plant and border a county with a coal-fired power plant can trade with any of the 400
mines.
We find that plants are approximately 4 percentage points more likely to purchase coal
from in-state mines that from mines in a different state. Again, this effect is robust to a range of
controls for the distance between the power plant and the coal mine. The same state boundary
also corresponds in some cases to a shared congressional district and county which we omit from
the estimation. Using the border pairs subsample, we find larger overall effects than our baseline
specification. The combined effect of the three boundaries in our baseline results is around 2-3
percentage points.
Next, we further restrict our sample by limiting each pair of adjacent-county power plants
to only being able to purchase coal from mines in either state of the adjacent counties. For
example, the power plants in Mobile County, Alabama and Jackson County, Mississippi would
13

have as potential trading partners the coal mines in Alabama and Mississippi but we drop the
power plant-mine observations in which the mines are in other states. In this specification, the
border variable captures the relative difference in the probability of a trade between each mine in
Alabama and the plants in Mobile, County Alabama and Jackson County, Mississippi. Our
neighboring county-pair fixed effect captures unobserved characteristics of the Mobile/Jackson
area and the remaining difference in probability is assigned to the border effect. The results are
slightly larger in the specification that limits a power plant’s potential trading partners to only the
in-state mines on either end of the border. In this specification, the effect of a sharing a state is in
the neighborhood of 5 percentage points.
Price and Contract Characteristics Results
When we focus on the characteristics of the trades (i.e. transacted price, contracted vs
spot, and contract duration), we substantially reduce our sample size because we do not observe
trade characteristics for trades that do not occur. After focusing only on trades that occur, the
correlation between our cross-boundary variables increases because many of the, for example,
different-county but same-state observations that induced orthogonality between the political
boundary controls did not result in trades. As such, we highlight the results of F-tests for the joint
significance of our political-boundary variables in each of these cases.
Evidence of jurisdictional effects on price after controlling for distance are mixed, at
best. The point estimates in Table 8 indicate that there is a price discount associated with incounty coal purchases of about 12-15 cents per million BTUs. This suggests that coal mines are
able to extract higher prices from power plants that are outside their county than from those who
are within the county. Again, these regressions include controls for the distance between the
power plant and the coal mine, so it is unlikely that this is simply reflecting transportation costs.
However, only in the case of the spline distance control is there any evidence that the crossboundary controls are jointly different from zero. This suggests that the mines are not able to
extract different prices from plants that are across jurisdictional lines than from plants within
their jurisdiction. Similarly, when we control for distance using the ten-mile bins, we do not find
statistical significance for any of our key explanatory variables, and the F-test suggests joint
insignificance. The weak evidence of plants extracting lower prices from in-state mines provides
14

further suggestive evidence that the relationship between plants and mines is driven by a political
mechanism rather than a cost minimizing mechanism.
In Table 9 we estimate the effect of our boundary effects on the probability that a trade is
associated with a long-term contract rather than a spot trade. Similarly, in Table 10 we estimate
the effect of our boundary effects on the length of the contract for those trades that are associated
with contracts. Each of our political boundary controls is negative but statistically insignificant
when we examine whether power plants and mines enter into contracts or interact on the spot
market. We also find that both the county and state boundaries affect contract duration.
Specifically, we find that contracts are longer between power plants and mines that are within the
same but shorter between power plants and mines that are within the same state. The magnitude
of the two coefficients are relatively similar but of opposite signs, indicating that mines and
power plants that are in the same state but not in the same county, tend to be shorter than
contracts between cross-state firms as well as shorter than contracts between intra-county firms.
These results are broadly consistent with state specific/relationship-specific capital being
present. Joskow (1984) who attributed the longer duration of relatively high quality contracts to
relationship-specific capital. Moreover, the effect of the boundary control on contracting
duration and prevalence indicates the potential for a different type of relationship specific capital.
While Joskow (1984) focused on the physical characteristics of the plants and the coal that they
burned, our result is consistent with relationship-specific political capital inducing power plants
and mines to operate together.

Power Plant Placement and Closures Results
In Table 11, we report estimates of equation (3). We find a jurisdictional effect in power
plant placement decisions. After controlling for the distance to the closest coal mine, the
probability of having a coal fired power plant in a county is about 0.5 percentage points higher if
there is a coal mine in the county than if there is not a coal mine in the county. Note that this
indicates that even after controlling for the distance to the closest coal mine, a county is more
likely to have a coal burning power plant if there is an in-county coal mine. Surprisingly, the
15

effect of having an in-state but out-of-county coal mine actually serves to decrease the
probability that there is a coal power plant in the county. This effect is quite small relative to the
in-county effect.
In Table 12, we find a jurisdictional effect in coal power plant closures. A power plant (or
rather a generator) that is in a state with a coal mine is approximately 7 percentage points less
likely to have closed by 2014 than a coal power plant without a potential in-state trading partner.
In each case, these results suggest that coal mines’ political influence on the electricity sector
exceeds our primary estimates which take coal plant stock as exogenous.

The Social Cost of Within Coal Mining States Transactions
Coal burning features a high carbon intensity of roughly 2300 pounds per MWH of
power. In addition to producing this global externality, coal use by power plants creates many
local negative environmental and health externalities. These externalities are shown to reduce
nearby home values (Davis 2011). In an area suffering from high unemployment, these may be
secondary concerns.
We estimate the environmental implications of local coal protectionism in two
complementary fashions. First, we estimate the local impacts of coal consumption using data on
ambient air pollution levels in counties that have power plants that purchase coal for the
electricity sector and in surrounding counties. Second, we estimate aggregate emissions from the
electricity sector due to coal protection. The former approach allows for a more specific
consideration of who is affected by pollution, while the latter approach provides an aggregate
effect of coal mining protection that takes into account general equilibrium impacts in the
electricity sector.
In order to examine the effect of coal protectionism on ambient pollution, we obtain daily
pollution monitor data on SO2 and PM01 from the EPA’s AQM database. We then aggregate
these data to the county-year level by averaging across daily monitor observations for each
monitor in a county and merge them with the total amount of delivered coal to a county for
electricity generation, as derived from the fuel deliveries data. Finally, in order to examine total
emissions, we obtain CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions from the EPA’s Air Markets Program Data
16

(AMPD). AMPD reports emissions for each power plant that is covered under any air markets
program. Most power plants are covered by at least one air markets program in the latter half of
our sample. We then aggregate CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions across power plants in each
NERC region up to the monthly level.
In order to examine the effect of coal protection on ambient are quality, we estimate
𝑌𝑗𝑠𝑡 = 𝐵1 ∗ 𝐼𝑛 𝐽𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑡 + 𝐵2 ∗ 𝐶𝑜𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 + 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑦 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑗 +
(5)

𝛾𝑡 + 𝑈𝑗𝑠𝑡

Where Yjst is the average measurement of ambient pollution levels for sulfur dioxide and
particulate matter in county j in state s at year t, In Jurisdiction Mine is a logical vector indicating
whether or not state s has at least one coal mine in its state, and CoalPercentage is the percentage
of electricity generated in state s that came from coal.
Similarly, in order to examine the effect of coal protection on total greenhouse gas
emissions, we estimate
𝑌𝑛𝑡 = 𝐵1 ∗ 𝐼𝑛 𝐽𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑒 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑡 + 𝐵2 ∗ 𝑁𝐸𝑅𝐶 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑛 + 𝑇𝑡 + 𝑈𝑛𝑡
(6)
where Ynt is the CO2, NOx, and SO2 emissions from AMPD regulated power plants in nerc n in
year t, In Jursidiction Mine Percentage is the proportion of coal-fired power plants in a NERC
region that have an in-state coal mine and NERC Characteristics is a matrix of NERC
characteristics.
If coal power plants with nearby coal mines are more likely to continue to operate – or
operate at higher levels of generation – than coal power plants without nearby coal mines, we
would expect a positive coefficient on the In Jurisdiction Mine Percentage variable.
Tables 13 and 14 present these regression results. As we would expect purchases of coal
by electricity generators at the state level results in increased SO2 concentrations in counties
within the state. Based on our OLS regression results presented in Table 4, we would expect that
the effect of having an in-state coal plant would increase SO2 concentrations by approximately
40 percent relative to monitors in states that do not have coal plants. We do not find statistically
17

significant effects of coal plants on PM10 levels, although most of the states that have the
highest annual concentrations of PM10 in our sample are also prone to fires, which can cause
spikes in PM pollution, and such effects could be driving the variation in PM10 readings in our
sample.
We also find that the percentage of power plants in a NERC region that have an in-state
coal mine trading option leads to increases in CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions. In the case of
CO2, for every percentage point increase in the proportion of power plants in a NERC region
that are close to an in-state mine, an extra 2.3 million tons of CO2 is emitted. Assuming a social
cost of carbon of $40 per short ton, these results suggest that each percentage point increase in
the number of coal-fired power plants in a NERC region with a potential in-state trading partner
results in $92 million per year in added social costs. Based on the average prevalence of in-state
mines in our data set (53%), this would indicate that around 8% of CO2 emissions from the
electricity sector are attributable to this effect.

Mechanisms
Our main explanation for within political boundary trading focuses on political
intervention. Elected officials such as a mining state’s governors, Congressmen and local
officials have an incentive to help their constituents. Miners and the members of their
communities are typically low skill people with long time roots to the area. Local elected
officials in coal states are aware that their constituents face significant dislocation costs and seek
to protect them from long-lasting negative income shocks by stabilizing demand for their
constituents’ output. The conversion of a power plant in Kentucky from coal to natural gas, for
example, resulted in substantial opposition from state officials representing the area on the
grounds that the reduction in coal demand would harm the local economy.
Elected officials in coal areas have strong incentives to take actions that increase the
demand for coal. Mining is a high paying job for low skill workers. Indeed, the average wage for
all U.S. coal miners was $82,000 in 2013 according to the National Mining Association. The
average wage across all industries, by contrast, was under $50,000. Coal mining counties tend to
18

have a slightly weaker economy than non-coal mining economies. In 2014, the average
unemployment rate in counties with coal mines was 6.8 while the average unemployment rate in
counties without coal mines was 6.5.7 Because coal mining activity is concentrated in relatively
rural communities and require relatively little education, these statistics actually underestimate
the coal mining wage premium. Further, mining jobs create a local multiplier effect in their
community, resulting in additional job opportunities and economic activity.
By boosting coal demand and raising local wages and home prices, elected officials can
achieve stability for local families. Stable families and their communities go hand in hand in
areas that do not have alternative industries to turn to. Families enjoying job security are less
likely to experience divorce, substance abuse and economic hardship. Labor economists have
emphasized the possibility of scaring due to duration dependence associated with experiencing
unemployment (Borjas and Heckman 1980, Black and Sanders 2002, Black, McKinnish and
Sanders 2003, 2005a, 2005b). If coal miners lose their jobs and become unemployed, the
duration dependence hypothesis posits that they will become increasingly less likely to find a
new job and are unlikely to find a new job that pays as well.
The children who grow up in such families are likely to be especially affected. Based on
Heckman’s dynamic complementarity model, the early years of life are crucial for raising the
chances of a child achieving her full potential (Heckman 2007). If the household’s income
declines and if the family divorces, such a child is less likely to succeed. This sad dynamic
shows how reduced coal demand translates into widening income inequality and increased
poverty in these rural areas.
Elected officials in coal areas will understand this dynamic and this creates an incentive
(due to both altruism for constituents as well as the desire to be re-elected) for local politicians
to use their clout to encourage in state coal power plants to “buy locally”. In this sense, local

This comparison excludes Wyoming which has a substantial natural gas and petroleum industry and an
unemployment rate that is far below the national average.

elected officials internalize the social benefits from boosting coal demand but have only weak
incentives to internalize the social costs of coal burning.8
There are alternative mechanisms that could contribute to within jurisdiction coal trade.
Past investments by local power plants to optimize the power generation process as a function of
local coal purchases may create a “lock in” effect through the asset specificity of past
investments (Joskow 1985). One possible explanation for why the two parties would be willing
to “lock in” to a long term relationship is because they anticipate that there will be less future
political risk between two contracting parties since they are both represented by the same
political leaders.
To provide some evidence on the relevance of different potential mechanisms for
understanding “within border” coal trade, we study how the propensity to purchase in state coal
grows with state leverage over power plants and in times of recession. One might expect that
elected officials would be more likely to use their clout to encourage the demand or in state coal
mining when the economy is weak.
Government-owned utilities would be more susceptible to job protectionary pressure than
independent power producers who would be more concerned with profit maximization and less
concerned with local stakeholders. We would therefore expect a smaller border effect when a
greater proportion of power plants were controlled by independent power producers. Cicala
(2014) documents that when utilities were forced to divest their power plants to new owners
during electricity deregulation that fuel procurement costs declined for coal plants. If political
protectionism is responsible for some of Cicala’s (2014) effect, we would expect our border
protection estimate to be smaller after deregulation than before it.

The claim that local officials internalize the local benefits of coal trading is related to earlier
research on cross-store spillovers in demand at a shopping mall. Gould, Pashigian, and
Pendergrast (2005) document that by offering a rent discount, the mall owner can attract an
anchor tenant who attracts plenty of customers. Anticipating that there will be walking traffic,
other mall tenants are willing to pay more for commercial leases to have access to these potential
customers.

In order to investigate this dynamic over time we estimate our primary specification as a
cross section for each year between 1990 and 2014, dropping the time specific fixed effects.
Estimating the model separately for each year, rather than estimating a single model with
interactions between the time fixed-effects and the political boundary variables lets our distance
control adjust over time so that changes in the political protectionism over time are not
confounded with changes in shipping infrastructure or cost. Figure 4 shows the 95 percent
confidence interval on the same state coefficient over time (the same Congressional District and
same county patterns yield similar findings). From 1990-1995, the coefficients increased
indicating relatively greater protectionary behavior. Between 1995 and approximately 2000,
there was relatively less protectionary behavior. Protectionary behavior was relatively consistent
between 2000 and 2006 after which it generally decreased through 2014.
The majority of our sample falls after electricity deregulation was already in effect or
being implemented so we do not have pre-deregulation coefficients with which to compare
against the early 1990s results. Still, it is surprising that protectionist behavior is growing during
the expansion of deregulation during the early 1990s. This provides some suggestive evidence
our political jurisdiction effect is not driving the reductions in procurement costs noted by Cicala
(2014).
We also note that changes in political climate throughout our sample period. The
magnitude of the boundary effect is generally decreasing (less local purchasing) during the
1990s, the late 2000s and the 2010s, while it is increasing (more local purchasing) during the
early and mid-2000s. Note that the 1992-2000 and 2008-2014 periods with declining local
protectionary power aligns with a Democratic Presidential Administration, while the increasing
protectionary power of the 2000s aligns with the Republican Bush Administration. We do not,
however, attempt to assign any causality between the political climate and the effect.

Conclusion
The phase out of coal would be a Hicksian Pareto improvement for the United States.
Based on a Social Cost of Carbon of $30 a ton, the current national externality from coal
associated with in-state mine purchasing (abstracting from criteria air pollution costs) was $4

21

billion in 2014.9 While it may be socially efficient to phase out coal, the costs of such a transition
are spatially concentrated.
States that specialize in mining have incentives to promote the growth (or at least slow
the decline) of one of their key industries. Given the durability of housing capital and the built up
social networks established in mining areas, its residents face both migration costs and asset
losses if the demand for coal mining declines. Such individuals face a fundamental job retraining
challenge that middle-aged workers who have worked in mines will have trouble transitioning to
other jobs. In this sense, there are local “Social Benefits of Carbon” and these benefits have been
ignored in studying issues related to the political economy of phasing out coal. Local officials in
coal areas are well aware that many of their constituents depend on the continuing viability of the
coal industry. Local officials internalize the benefits of coal’s prolonged sunset but they ignore
the social environmental costs associated with such implicit subsidies. Our examination of the
sunset of the coal industry revisits recent research that has examined how rural communities
have gained from the fracking boom (Feyrer, Mansur, and Sacerdote (2015) and Alcott and
Kenniston (2014)).
We have introduced a detection approach to measure “excess” within border transactions.
Our empirical research design exploits the fact that coal mines and power plants vary with
respect to their geographic location. Some lie within the same political jurisdiction while others
do not. This variation allows us to use a flexible distance polynomial between pairs of power
plants and coal mines to recover key border effects. We document an increased likelihood of
trade and larger trade quantities when partners are within the same state, county, and
congressional district.
The costs of the CO2 emissions associated with this local “excess demand” are
substantial, nearly $100 million a year in excess social carbon costs. Still, sustained low natural
gas prices may limit the duration of coal’s sunset as market forces drive additional natural gas
capacity to supplant coal plants. Given the proximity of environmental tipping points associated
with particular levels of CO2 concentrations as well as uncertainty about energy policy under the
Trump Administration, coal protectionism may still cause major environmental costs.
9

2600000 tons of coal * 53 percent of plants close to an in-state mine * 30 dollars per ton = $4.1 billion
22

Future research could consider how to design a coal buyout that compensates coal miners
and their communities for their expected losses. Harstad (2012) has proposed a mechanism of
“buying coal” from marginal unregulated coal producers and then keeping these purchased
deposits in the ground after restricting production among regulated coal producers. His proposal
could be modified to address the problem of coal’s sunset by purchasing domestic coal reserves
and by paying coal miners to mine the purchased coal. This would compensate mine owners and
workers for their losses associated with natural gas production and environmental regulations.
