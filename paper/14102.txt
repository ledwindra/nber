Marijuana Use and High School Dropout: The Influence of Unobservables

NBER Working Paper No. 14102

JEL No. I10,I18
ABSTRACT
In this study we reconsider the relationship between heavy and persistent marijuana use and high school
dropout status using a unique prospective panel study of over 4500 7th grade students from South
Dakota who are followed up through high school. Propensity score weighting is used to adjust for
baseline differences that are found to exist before marijuana initiation occurs (7th grade). Weighted
logistic regression incorporating these propensity score weights is then used to examine the extent
to which time-varying factors, including substance use, also influence the likelihood of dropping out
of school. We find a positive association between marijuana use and dropping out (OR=5.68), over
half of which can be explained by prior differences in observational characteristics and behaviors.
The remaining association (OR=2.31) is made statistically insignificant when measures of cigarette
smoking are included in the analysis. Because no physiological justification can be provided for why
cigarette smoking would reduce the cognitive effects of marijuana on schooling, we interpret this as
evidence that the association is due to other factors. We then use the rich data to explore which constructs
are driving this result, determining that it is time-varying parental and peer influences.

I. Introduction
Considerable research has demonstrated a positive association between early marijuana
use and low educational attainment, both years of education and high school dropout status
(Chatterji, 2006; Bray et al., 2000; Ellickson et al., 1998; Schulenberg et al, 1994; Mensch and
Kendel, 1988; Newcomb and Bentler, 1986). This finding has been interpreted as evidence that
marijuana use interferes with learning by impairing memory, attention and/or motivation, any of
which could translate into poor schooling outcomes. However, evidence supporting alternative
explanations for the negative association challenges this causal interpretation. For example,
some studies show that poor schooling outcomes actually precede regular and heavy marijuana
use (Fergusson and Horwood, 1997; Hawkins et al, 1992; Newcomb and Bentler, 1988). Other
research suggests that the relationship between marijuana use and poor educational performance
is explained by a common third variable (Barnes et al., 2005; Kumar et al, 2002; Sander, 1998;
Shulenberg et al., 1994; Farrell and Fuchs, 1982).
Separating out the effect of marijuana use from other potential confounding influences is
essential to settling the question of whether the marijuana use and schooling are causally related.
However, doing so is complicated by the sheer number of potential confounders and the presence
of selectivity biases in observational data. In addition, adolescence is a period of development
and marked change in the child’s environment; hence accounting for third variables at one point
in time may miss relevant changes that have occurred earlier or later. Instrumental variables
techniques usually employed to overcome these sort of problems have been less useful in the
case of illicit drugs, as models testing what are typically weak state-level instruments generally
reject the assumption of endogeneity (Chatterji, 2006; Bray et al., 2000).

3

This study revisits the question of how and why marijuana use and schooling are related,
improving upon previous studies in two important ways. First, it minimizes the effects of
selectivity bias by using propensity score methods, which create observationally equivalent
groups of marijuana users and nonusers who are matched on a rich set of constructs and
observable characteristics at baseline. A new longitudinal data source allows us to control for a
wide variety of alternative factors that have been used to explain the association between
marijuana and high school dropout, including one’s predisposition toward problem behavior, use
of substances other than marijuana, peer and family social influences, attachment to conventional
institutions such as family, school and religion, emotional distress and time preference. Second,
we take a dynamic approach, evaluating whether changes in these constructs between early and
middle adolescence help explain the association, rather than just assuming that the measurement
or influence of a particular construct is stable over time.
As in previous studies, we find a positive association between marijuana use and high
school dropout status (OR=5.69), but we show that over half of the association can be explained
by prior differences in observational characteristics and behaviors (i.e. selectivity bias). The
remaining association (OR=2.31) becomes statistically insignificant after measures of cigarette
smoking are included in the analysis, a variable that is not systematically included in economic
analyses. Because we are aware of no physiological justification for why cigarette smoking
should reduce marijuana’s cognitive effects on learning, we interpret this as indicating that the
negative relationship between marijuana use and high school completion is not causal but
generated by omitted variable bias. We then explore the source of this bias using the rich panel
data.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief summary
of the literature indicating the importance of alternative constructs frequently ignored in the
economics literature. Section III describes our propensity score methods and the data used to
construct these weights. Section IV presents the empirical model used to evaluate the impact of
persistent and heavy marijuana use on schooling. Results are presented in Section V. Section
VI summarizes the implications for future work by economists interested in examining the causal
association between marijuana use and high school outcomes. .

II. Literature Review
Three explanations have been put forth for the association between marijuana use and
poor educational performance: (1) marijuana use causes poor educational outcomes; (2)
marijuana use is a consequence of poor school performance; and (3) marijuana use and poor
schooling outcomes are not directly related but share a common underlying cause, such as
deviant behavior, peers, family dysfunction, or rates of time preference. Evidence supporting
each of these explanations comes from studies informed by a variety of disciplines.
The basic sciences provide the main rationale for believing that marijuana use causes
poor schooling outcomes. Neuroscientists have shown that marijuana use interrupts normal
cognitive functioning and memory by activating cannabinoid receptor sites in the part of the
brain that controls memory (Matsuda et al., 1993; Heyser et al., 1993). What remains debated is
whether the detrimental effect on memory and cognitive functioning is short-lived, sustained for
a period of time past intoxication, or cumulative in terms of its total detrimental effect on
cognitive functioning. Although a few economic studies provide support for the cognitive

5

detriment explanation, none have satisfactorily dealt with the issue of endogeneity (Chatterji,
2006; Roebuck et al., 2004; Bray et al., 2000; Yamada et al., 1996).
Economics and psychology provide explanations for why poor schooling could precede
marijuana use. The economic theory of health production (Grossman, 1972) suggests that
schooling will be positively associated with healthy behavior and negatively associated with
unhealthy behaviors, as an individual’s ability to understand how particular behaviors affect
health improves with schooling and hence makes individuals better producers of health. The
psychological literature postulates that use of marijuana and other substances is a coping
mechanism for students who struggle in school (Newcomb and Bentler, 1986; Wills and
Shiffman, 1985). Empirically, a substantial literature outside of economics supports the notion
that poor educational attainment precedes marijuana use (Hawkins et al., 1992; Fergusson et al,
1996; Duncan et al 1998). However, evidence showing that poor schooling outcomes may
precede marijuana use does not rule out the possibility that marijuana use leads to poor (or
worse) schooling outcomes. The association may run both ways.
The third variable explanation is supported by several theories. Problem behavior theory
postulates that individuals with a predisposition toward nonconformity and deviance are more
likely to engage in multiple unconventional behaviors that reciprocally influence one another
(Jessor and Jessor, 1977; Donovan and Jessor, 1985). Social attachment theory argues that it is
weak bonds with family, school, religion, or other conventional institutions that lead to general
problem behaviors (Hawkins and Weis, 1985; Simmons and Blyth, 1987; Sommer, 1985).
Social learning theory (Bandura, 1977; 1985) stresses the influence of exposure to deviant peers
or family members who act as role models for specific actions through their approval of them.
Finally, health economists postulate that a positive association between poor schooling outcomes

6

and substance use could also result because of their association with a high discount rate or rate
of time preference (Fuchs, 1982; Farrell and Fuchs, 1982). Individuals with high rates of time
preference place greater value (or ‘utility’) on rewards and punishments that happen immediately
and less value on rewards and punishments that happen in the future. Substantial empirical
evidence supports each of these “third factor” theories (Roebuck et al., 2004; Brook et al., 1999;
Sander, 1998; Fergusson et al., 2002; Schulenberg et al., 1994).
Because the association between marijuana use and poor schooling outcomes persists
even after attempting to use instrumental variable techniques to deal with selection bias (e.g.
Chatterji, 2006; Roebuck et al., 2004; Bray et al., 2000), the hypothesis that marijuana use is
causally associated with poor schooling outcomes remains viable. However, the instruments in
all of these studies are so weak that the studies fall back on traditional OLS methods for drawing
conclusions. Thus, the critical issue of sample selection bias remains unanswered.
In this paper, we revisit the question of the causal association between marijuana use and
schooling using propensity score methods as an alternative strategy to reduce the influence of
selectivity bias. Taking the analysis a step farther, we also test the assumption of stable
unobserved influences. After adjusting for pre-existing differences in user groups, we control for
additional variables that change over time when assessing the relationship between marijuana
and high school dropout status. Thus, we can assess whether factors shown to influence these
associations change over time, as suggested by developmental theorists (LaGrange and White,
1985; Bailey and Hubbard, 1990).

III. Structural Model & Data
III.1. Causal Model and Propensity Score Approach

7

Our empirical model is based on the linear latent variable model in which the net benefits
of schooling, Y*, are a function of a vector of individual characteristics, xi, and, assuming a
causal influence of marijuana on schooling, the decision to be a heavy and persistent marijuana
user (HPMU), or:
Yi* = β xi + γ HPMUi + εi

(1)

We cannot observe the net benefits of schooling, but we do observe whether an
individual continues schooling or not:
Yi = 1 if Yi* > 0 and the person does not drop out of high school (DOi = 0).
Yi = 0 if Yi* < 0

and the person does drop out of high school (DOi = 1).

Let DO1 denote dropout status (1 if dropout; 0 otherwise) if a chosen student with
characteristics x is an HPMU. Similarly, let DO0 denote dropout status if the chosen student was
not an HPMU. Assuming a logistic specification, we can then denote the probability of an
HPMU dropping out and a non-HPMU dropping out, respectively, as:
(2)

P(DO1 = 1) = eμ + β x +γ/(1+ eμ + β x +γ)

(3)

P(DO0 = 1) = eμ + β x/(1+ eμ + β x ) .

The parameter γ determines the ratio of the odds of dropout for the counterfactual
outcomes and is the causal effect parameter of interest. We can observe only a single
counterfactual outcome on each student and cannot directly estimate γ. However, as discussed in
Bang and Robins (2005), weighting the data by the inverse probability of HPMU, also referred to
as the propensity score (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983), can yield consistent estimates of causal
effects provided the model for the propensity score or the structural model is correct and strong
ignorability holds.

8

Strong ignorability requires that there are no unobserved variables that predict both the
probability of dropping out and the probability of HPMU by the 10th grade (the point at which
school is no longer mandatory). To ensure strong ignorability, we need to construct propensity
score weights that can account for an array of constructs that the literature suggests are correlated
with both behaviors of interest, including early use of alcohol and cigarettes, deviance, time
preference, family influence, peer substance use, religiosity, social bonds, school bonds, parental
bonds and emotional distress.
Given a vector of such pre-existing variables, W, we estimate the propensity score pw =
Pr(HPMU = 1 | W) using generalized boosting methods (GBM), a flexible nonparametric
approach to modeling the log(pw/(1- pw)). GBM-based propensity scores provide a flexible
model for the propensity score equation, handle a large number of variables in an automated and
systematic manner, and have been shown to provide estimated propensity scores that yield better
estimates of effects than do other approaches (Ridgeway and McCaffrey, 2007).1
III.2. ALERT Plus Data
We use data from the field trial evaluation of the ALERT and ALERT Plus drug
prevention programs, which were administered to seventh-grade students in 61 middle schools
drawn from 48 school clusters in South Dakota in 1997. Schools in the study were randomly
assigned to one of the two treatment conditions or a control group condition (see Ellickson et al.,
2003 for details on the experimental trial). Students completed annual paper-and-pencil surveys
in school at Grades 7 through 11. Study participants also completed a mail or web survey during
the summer and fall of 2004, when they were about 14 to 20 months post their expected high
school graduation date. The baseline survey, administered to 5,857 students, collected detailed
1

We also explored models with fixed effects for the high schools the students attended in 9th grade. The
models provided qualitatively similar results to models without fixed effects and are not reported here.

9

background information, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, family structure, and parental
education, as well as information regarding school performance, deviant behavior, attitudes
toward school and family, family influences, peer influences, and substance use. Many of the
same questions were included in follow up surveys each year. Extensive tracking procedures to
survey students who left the study schools were employed. Follow-up response rates in 8th, 9th,
and 10th grade were 91, 87, and 83 percent respectively.
The dependent variable, high school dropout status, was collected through both school
administrative records and student self-reports. School-reported graduation data is missing for
301 students who moved from South Dakota before completing high school and for another 387
students for whom the South Dakota high schools reported graduation status was unknown.
Self-reported graduation status is missing for participants who failed to complete the post-high
school follow-up (n=2560) or completed the survey but failed to report high school graduation
status (n=29). The two data sources disagree with each other for some students. In particular, of
the students the school data reported as dropouts, 40% of the students who provided self-reported
status reported graduating. Hence, as discussed in the next section, we develop a model for the
join distribution of student and school-reported graduation status that allows for measurement
error in both.
Building on previous work demonstrating the importance of differentiating light and
heavy marijuana use (Chatterji, 2006; Roebuck et al., 2004; Ellickson et al., 1998;Yamada et al.,
1996), we construct a dichotomous measure of heavy and persistent marijuana use that equals
one if the student reports using marijuana three or more times in the past month on both the 9th
and 10th grade surveys and zero otherwise.

10

The following background, attitudinal and behavioral grade 7 control variables capture
the constructs represented in W: student demographics; family characteristics; school grades and
academic expectations; impulsivity; beliefs about the health consequences of alcohol, cigarette,
and marijuana use; parental monitoring; deviance; rates of time preference; religiosity; school
bonds; parental bonds; emotional distress; family (parent/sibling) substance use; and alcohol,
cigarette, and marijuana use in grade 7. We also control for peer effects for alcohol and cigarette
use, school size, region of the state, and the school’s experimental condition for the drug
prevention trial. 2 Because the sample is not perfectly balanced once we construct these
propensity score weights, we include some of these measures in the regression analyses in
addition to later measures of some of the same constructs (e.g. deviance in grades 8, 9 and 10;
substance use in grades 8, 9 and 10). Next, we discuss how these constructs are measured.
Unless otherwise noted, measures are created at grades 7 to 10 using parallel items; the grade 7
measure are included in the propensity score weights and measures from later grades are used in
sensitivity analyses.
Cigarette use is the logarithm of the 30 day average of one plus an overall frequency
index combining lifetime, past year, and past month frequency of use scaled by the student’s
quantity of use.3 Alcohol use is represented by categorical indicators measuring the number of
days of alcohol use in the past month, with levels of use indicated by none, 1, 2 to 4 days, 5 to 8
days, and 9 or more days (the reference group).
Deviance is the average frequency of six items tapping various deviant behaviors in each
grade (e.g. skipped school or breaking into houses, schools or places of business). To
2

Research suggests that by including all of these variables we risk potentially introducing greater variance into our
estimate (and hence are more likely to reject the finding of significance), but the alternative is introducing bias
caused by omitting relevant variables (Rubin, 1997; Rubin and Thomas, 1996).
3
The measure can be negative or positive (the minimum value is ln(1/30)=-3.4), because it uses the logarithm of
index values that are both less than or greater than 1.

11

accommodate developmental change in the forms of deviant behavior, we added three additional
items to the grade 10 deviance index.4 The student’s rate of time preference is measured in
grades 7 and 9 as the sum of two items: How much of the time do you do or feel the following
things: you do what feels good now without thinking about the future, and you focus on the short
run instead of the long run (range = 0 (never) – 5 (almost always)).
Grade-specific measures of family influences on student behavior are based on two items:
whether the respondent perceives the adult they are closest to has a drinking habit and the extent
to which their parents would disapprove of them smoking or using marijuana. Grade-specific
measures of peer effects are tapped through self-reports by the students regarding the frequency
with which they are with marijuana using peers and whether they think their best friend uses
marijuana.5
Student attitudes and beliefs about alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana are based on three
positive and three negative items for each substance, with a higher score on either scale
indicating more pro-drug attitudes. Indicators of bonds with conventional institutions are
captured through a measure of religiosity, school bonds, and parental bonds.6 Details regarding
the constructs of each of these can be found in Ellickson et al. (2003). Finally, we measured
emotional distress with the six-item mental health inventory index (MHI-6) that equals the MHI5 (Wells et al., 1996) plus an additional item on the frequency of feeling downhearted and blue
in past month. See Table 1 for descriptive statistics on all these variables.
4

Additional items are question regarding how often during the past year the student: ran away from home for a night
or more; stole or tried to steal items worth $50 or more; sold marijuana; sold other drugs; took a vehicle for a joyride
without the owner’s permission; drove a car, motorcycle or other vehicle after drinking alcohol; used strong-arm
force to get money of things from people; attacked someone with the idea of seriously hurting or killing that person;
purposely set fire or tried to set fire to a building, car, or other property; got into trouble with the police because of
something you did.
5
The original scales for the two items combined for the peer measures differ so the items are standardized to mean
zero and standard deviation one prior to being averaged for the index. Hence the index takes on both positive and
negative values, with higher values on this index indicating more exposure to peer-using friends.
6
Religiosity was not measures at grade 7.

Table 1 here
Attrition and missing data. The data set includes 4,375 students with both marijuana use
and high school dropout data, which excludes 718 cases without graduation information from
either source and 764 students without marijuana use at either grade 9, grade 10 or both grades.
To account for attrition, we weighted the observations using propensity score based nonresponse
weights (Little and Rubin, 2002). In this case the propensity score represents the probability that
a student with a given set of baseline covariate values answered the 9th and 10th grade survey
questions on past month marijuana use and had data on graduation status. Nonresponse weights
equal the inverse of this probability for responding students. Missing data for baseline covariates
are imputed using a Bayesian model for the joint distribution of all baseline and 8th grade followup variables.7 For data from the 9th and 10th grade follow-ups, missing values of independent
variables other than marijuana use are also imputed using a Bayesian model for the just
distribution of all analysis variables.

IV. Empirical Specification
As shown in Table 2, graduation information collected through self-reports did not
always match school administrator reports. To account for potential errors in reported
graduation status and make efficient use of the two incomplete data sources, we fit a model for
the joint distribution of student and school reported graduation status that allows for
measurement error in both. Given our structural model, we assumed a logistic regression model
for the true but not necessarily observed dropout status, DO = DO1HPMU + DO0 (1-HPMU),
7

The Bayesian imputation model uses a multivariate Gaussian distribution to approximate the joint distribution for
the variables conditional on the unobserved parameter values. The imputed values are a random sample from the
posterior distribution of the missing data and conditional on the observed data and the model. Using the NORM
software (Schafer, 1999), we sampled five sets of imputed values. Imputed values have been found to be robust to
model misspecifications (Schafer, 1997).

13

(4)

P(DO = 1 | x, HPMU) = eα+β’x+γ HPMU/(1+ eα+β’x +γ HPMU)

The model also assumes that both school and student reports of graduation status might
contain errors. The error rates were specified through the conditional distribution of selfreported status, U, given the true status, DO, and the conditional distribution of the school
reported status, Z, given DO. These were
(5) P(U = 1 | DO=1) = 1
(6) P(U = 1 | DO=0) = ε1
(7) P(Z = 1 | DO=1) = 1- ε2
(8) P(Z = 1 | DO=0) = ε2
Equation (5) assumes that high school graduates never incorrectly reported dropping out.
Equation (6) states that dropouts might self-report graduating with an error rate of ε1. Equations
(7) and (8) allow for errors in school reports and assume that false reports of dropout for
graduates and false reports of graduation for dropouts are equal.
Limited write-in data suggest that some students who had completed alternative
education programs mistakenly reported graduating from high school. We assumed that students
who had truly graduated from high school provided the correct information because there is no
obvious potential source of confusion that would result in misreporting graduation when it truly
occurred. We also assumed that students who reported dropping out provided the correct
information because there is no clear motivation for students to purposely misreport dropping out
(such as avoiding stigma or providing a socially desirable outcome) and because many students
who reported dropping out supplied reasons. Equations (7) and (8) are consistent with the
assumption that errors in school reporting are due to clerical mistakes, so that errors in either
direction have an equal probability of occurring.

14

Table 2 here
The model also assumes that U and Z are independent conditional on DO, which implies
that the errors made by schools are independent of errors by students. Given that the likely
sources of error in student and school reports are distinct this last assumptions seems reasonable.
Equations (4) – (8) yield
(9) P(U = u, Z = z | x, HPMU) =

ueα + β ' x +γHPMU ε 2(1− z ) (1 − ε 2 ) z + ε 1u (1 − ε 1 ) (1−u ) ε 2z (1 − ε 2 ) (1− z )
1 + eα + β ' x +γHPMU

.

From Equation (9), we derived a pseudo log-likelihood function for the observed pairs of
(U, Z), weighted by the propensity scores weights, to obtain estimates of (β, ε1, and ε2). We
estimated standard errors for the parameter estimates using a cluster adjusted sandwich estimator
(Liang and Zeger, 1986) based on the weighted pseudo log-likelihood function. To account for
the imputation of predictor variables, we repeated the estimation of parameters and standard
errors with each of the five imputation completed datasets and combined the resulting estimates
using standard methods (Schafer, 1997).8

IV. Results
Figure 1 demonstrates the balance between variable distributions for the HPMU and other
students in terms of the absolute standardized bias for the each pre-existing variable controlled in
our analysis. For each variable, the absolute standardized bias equals the absolute value of the
difference in the mean for the marijuana users and the (weighted) mean for other students
divided by the standard deviation for the marijuana users. If the groups are comparable these

8

We tested model specification by allowing the probability of errors in student self-reported data to depend
on student variables and using alternative probit link functions. The results were qualitatively invariant to the
model; consequently, we report the results from the parsimonious model of Equation (9) rather than alternatives.

15

values should be close to zero. Values of greater than 0.25 are often considered problematic (Ho
et al., 2007).
Figure 1 here
As shown in the figure the groups differed substantially on many variables before
weighting for baseline differences in observable characteristics, with the absolute standardized
bias being greater than 0.2 for the majority of variables and being over 0.5 for 12 percent of the
variables. After weighting, the largest absolute standardized bias is just over 0.2 and only eight
differences are significant. Given the differences in baseline even after weighting, we include
variables with large differences (greater than 0.2) in our high school dropout equation after
weighting to further reduce the potential for biases in our findings. We also explored alternative
specifications with additional pre-existing variables included in the logistic regression model for
dropout to ensure that our results could not be explained by residual differences between the
groups on the pre-existing variables.
Table 3 presents results from our baseline models that evaluate the impact of persistent
marijuana use during grades 9 & 10 on high school dropout status. Model 1, which accounts
only for attrition (using nonreponse weights), yields a statistically significant nearly six-fold
increase in the odds of high school dropout for persistent marijuana users than nonusers or casual
users, and the finding is statistically significant. Model 2 shows that when we also account for
differences in baseline characteristics between persistent marijuana users and nonusers by
incorporating the propensity score weights, marijuana use remains statistically significant but it
is now associated with just over a 2.3 fold increase in the odds of dropout. If we can assume
strong ignorability, then we can conclude that heavy and persistent marijuana use increases the
risk of high school dropout.

16

Table 3 here
To test the strong ignorability assumption, we explore the effect of adding
contemporaneous measures of substance use that might share common unobservables with
marijuana use (Models 3 and 4). Because students who use marijuana are more likely to drink
alcohol (Gfroefer et al., 2002) and drinking can cause cognitive impairments and affect high
school graduation (Cook and Moore, 1993), we first consider alcohol, Including days of alcohol
use during grades 8 through 10 does not change the marijuana results qualitatively. In fact, the
odds ratio on persistent marijuana use actually increases. Next, we consider cigarettes (Model
4). Unlike alcohol, there is no physiological reason why cigarette smoking would affect school
performance or dropout status, as smoking is not known to impair cognitive functioning nor is it
known to offset the deleterious effects on cognitive functioning associated with marijuana use.
However, numerous studies have shown that smoking is a strong predictor of marijuana use
(Gfroefer et al., 2002; Ellickson et al., 1998; Sommer, 1985). Model 4 shows that including
cigarette smoking in grades 8 through 10 causes a substantial reduction in the magnitude and our
marijuana use measure, which is no longer a statistically significant predictor of high school
dropout status.
If heavy and persistent marijuana use was only associated with high school dropout
because of its impact on cognitive functioning, then including cigarette use in our regression
model should have no impact on the coefficient (or odds ratio) on marijuana use. The fact that it
does suggests that the association is largely generated by an omitted variable bias. Recall that
the propensity score weights are constructed using variables representing a wide range of
constructs previously reviewed, but the constructs are all measured at baseline (Grade 7 or 8). If

17

the influence of particular constructs changes over time, then baseline corrections will be
insufficient to represent them.
Models 5 and 6 evaluate whether the omitted variable bias is caused by lack of controls
for school performance. School performance measures, such as grades, are presumed to impact
the likelihood of completing high school but may also be directly affected by marijuana use, so
we intentionally excluded them from previous analyses to reduce endogeneity bias. Model 5
shows that including grades in the 8th, 9th and 10th grade, while significantly influencing the
likelihood of dropping out, has only a small impact on the estimated effect of marijuana use.
When school grades are included (Model 5), the odds ratio for marijuana falls slightly but
remains statistically significant. When cigarette use is included with grades (Model 6), the odds
ratio for marijuana use drops substantially and is no longer significant but cigarette use continues
to have a positive impact on high school dropout status.
Table 4 provides the results of sensitivity analyses that explore the impact of probable
sources of the relationship between marijuana use and dropout that cigarettes use might be
representing. In the first row, we include three separate indices of deviance in grades 8, 9 and
10, finding that the odds ratio for marijuana use is reduced but remains statistically significant
unless cigarettes are also included (row 2). Indices of the student’s bonds to social institutions
(religious and school) in grades 8, 9 and 10 also do not account for the relationship between
marijuana use and high school dropout. The odds ratio in this specification (Row 3) remains
greater than 2 and statistically significant, unless cigarette use is also added (Row 4). We get the
exact same findings when we add rates of time preference (Rows 5 & 6), emotional distress
(Rows 7 & 8) and family stress (Rows 9 & 10). Including attitudes toward drugs yields a
somewhat larger drop in the odds ratio for marijuana use (Row 11), although the odds ratio is

18

statistically significant at the 6% level and only becomes completely insignificant when
measures of cigarette use are included (Row 12). In Rows 13 and 15, we finally identify two
factors that explain the relationship between marijuana use and dropout: family influence and
peer effects in grades 8, 9 or 10. When these indices are included (without cigarette use),
marijuana use has a much smaller odds ratio and is no longer a significant predictor of high
school dropout status. Cigarette use is significant when it is also included (Rows 14 & 16),
Table 4 here
V. Discussion and Conclusions
A number of interesting conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, the Table 3
results indicate that important differences in baseline characteristics exist between individuals
who choose to use marijuana and those who do not, even before most of these individuals ever
initiate marijuana. Ignoring the selectivity bias indicated by these differences can lead to a
significant over-estimation of the association between marijuana use and schooling. Once we
accounted for these baseline differences using propensity score weights, the odds ratio on
marijuana use was cut in half, although still quite large and statistically significant.
Second, the results in Tables 3 and 4 indicate that the remaining relationship between
marijuana use and dropout does not reflect a causal effect on cognitive functioning. The oddsratio for marijuana use is greatly reduced and no longer statistically significant after we control
for the students’ grade 9 and 10 cigarette smoking. There are three potential interpretations of
this result. First, marijuana use causes cigarette smoking and controlling for smoking in the
model is inducing a negative bias on the coefficient for marijuana use. This interpretation,
however, is not supported by scientific evidence. We are not aware of any scientific evidence

19

showing that cigarette use has an independent and direct negative effect on cognition; moreover,
controlling for grades has almost no effect on the odd-ratio for marijuana use.
The second possible interpretation of the cigarette result is that there is common
unexplained heterogeneity among students who smoke marijuana and cigarettes and including
cigarette use in the model results in negative endogeneity bias in the odd-ratio for marijuana use.
A negative endogeneity bias requires that, conditional on these unobserved factors for smoking,
students with greater unobserved risks for marijuana use have smaller risks for dropout. This
seems unlikely. In all observed data from our study and many other studies, youth who use
marijuana have greater risk factors for negative behaviors and outcomes including negative peer
associations, weak social bonds, low aspirations, and increased deviant behaviors. While we
cannot rule out the possibility that unobserved heterogeneity creates a situation where
conditioning on smoking reverses the strong relationship between marijuana use and negative
risk factors, this sort of endogeneity bias seems much less likely than omitted-variable bias
between marijuana use and dropout.
The third potential explanation, that the relationship between marijuana use and dropout
is attributable to omitted bias arising from a failure to fully account for pre-existing differences
between students who use marijuana in grades 9 and 10 and those who do not, is the most
defensible. Cigarette smoking is known to be correlated with multiple demographic and
psychosocial risk factors for negative outcomes (Collins and Ellickson, 2004; Tucker et al.,
2006). In this study, two other risk factors, peer associations and family influences, also
accounted for the relationship between marijuana use and dropout. Although peer associations
could be endogenous and causally influenced by marijuana use, this should be less true of family
influences.

20

We also note that controlling for a rich set of variables at grade seven was not sufficient
to control for the dynamic changes that occur during adolescence and that result in students who
are similar at grades 7 and 8 choosing to (or not to) engage in heavy and persistent marijuana use
during grades 9 and 10. The unobserved differences then persist, creating differential risks for
dropout and a spurious relationship between marijuana and dropout even conditional on the
baseline data.
When interpreting the above results, two study limitations should be kept in mind. First,
we examine student behaviors in only one state, South Dakota. Because South Dakota is very
rural, with only two major cities, this sample may not accurately reflect the experience of all U.S.
students. Second, inherent measurement error or possible limitations in our measurement of
specific baseline constructs could partially explain the insufficiency of baseline measures to
remove differences between marijuana users and other students that contribute to differences in
dropout rates. In other words, there may still be unobservable factors biasing our results.
Nonetheless, the results presented here show that the negative association between
marijuana use and high school completion cannot be viewed as causal. Instead, our findings
suggest that this association is generated by a spurious correlation with unobserved factors that
change in significant ways during early adolescence, which reduces the ability of traditional
econometric methods to adequately account for them. We cannot conclude that marijuana use
has no deleterious effect on cognitive functioning. This study does not directly assess the affect
of marijuana on cognitive ability. Instead, it examines an outcome that represents a cumulative
decision based on a variety of factors, including ability, school performance, institutional
bonding, peer effects, attitudes, and economic status. What this study does suggest is that the
positive association that has been frequently interpreted as a causal effect instead reflects a

21

common shared association with other time persistent and time varying factors that frequently
get omitted from economic studies examining this relationship.
In addition to the contributions regarding the importance and nature of time variant
unobserved heterogeneity, this study also provides insights regarding appropriate instruments
when trying to identify causal associations using instrumental variables techniques. Our results
show that measures of cigarette use, peer substance use and parental substance use, which have
been used in previous analyses, would be poor instruments as they are heavily correlated with
high school completion as well as marijuana use.

Figure 1. Comparison of HPMU and other students on covariates measured prior to HPMU
measure before and after propensity score weighting. Dots represent the absolute standardized
bias, the absolute value of the quantity of the difference in the mean for HPMU and other
students divided by the standard deviation for the HPMU students, for each variable considered
in the modeling, lines connect dot for the same variable with and without weighting solid dots
denote statistically significant differences (p < 0.05)
