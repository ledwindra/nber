Follow the Money: Methods for Identifying Consumption and Investment Responses to a
Liquidity Shock

NBER Working Paper No. 19696
December 2013
JEL No. D12,D92,G21,O12,O16
ABSTRACT
Identifying the impacts of liquidity shocks on spending decisions is difficult methodologically but
important for theory, practice, and policy. Using seven different methods on microenterprise loan applicants,
we find striking results. Borrowers report uses of loan proceeds strategically, and more generally their
reporting depends on elicitation method. Borrowers also interpret loan use questions differently than
the key counterfactual: spending that would not have occurred sans loan. We identify the counterfactual
using random assignment of loan approvals and short-run follow-up elicitation of major household
and business cash outflows, and estimate that about 100% of loan-financed spending is on business
inventory.

I. Introduction
What are the impacts of liquidity shocks on the consumption and investment decisions of
households and small businesses? Answers to this question have implications for the theory,
practice, and regulation of credit, as well as for modeling intertemporal consumer choice. They
shed light on perceived returns to investment, and on the extent to which constraints bind more
for some types of household spending than others. Estimating impacts of liquidity shocks matters
in many domains, for example in understanding household leveraging and deleveraging
decisions in the wake of credit supply shocks, 1 as well as evaluating interventions such as
business grants,2 unconditional cash transfers,3 and microcredit expansions.4
Papers that track responses to liquidity shocks often focus on estimating medium- and longterm effects by measuring spending patterns, balance sheets, or summary statistics of financial
conditions several months or years post-shock. This reduced-form evidence has proven quite
useful, but it often leaves the mechanism underlying any change unidentified. For each possible
state of the world many months post-liquidity shock -- high enterprise growth relative to
baseline, low enterprise growth, consumption growth, etc. -- there are many paths from the
liquidity change to that outcome. Identifying mechanisms is important because different paths
can have different welfare implications.
To take an example closest to the setting we examine in this paper, many microcredit impact
evaluations do not find significant effects of microcredit on enterprise scale or profitability one
or two years post-intervention, even when the loans are targeted to those who are
microentrepreneurs at baseline.5 There are at least three possible explanations for these findings:
1) impacts only materialize over longer horizons due to compounded benefits, adjustment, etc.
This hypothesis often motivates researchers and program advocates to highlight the value of
longer-term outcome data; 2) microentrepreneurs do not actually invest marginal liquidity in
their businesses, perhaps because they are credit constrained on the margin and have household
investment or consumption smoothing with a higher expected return on investment (in utility
terms) than business investment; 3) microentrepreneurs do invest microloan proceeds in their
businesses, but these investments do not end up earning a positive net return.
The second and third explanations highlight the value of very short-run data on spending
decisions post-shock: “following the money” from liquidity to spending decisions can reveal the

mechanisms underlying the paths from shock to outcomes. If the second explanation is accurate
that motivates further attempts to identify causes, consequences, and cures for credit constraints.
If the third explanations is accurate that motivates further attempts to understand why
entrepreneurs make investments that, ex-post at least, do not yield a positive net return on
average (Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen 2002; Anagol, Etang, and Karlan 2013; Karlan,
Knight, and Udry 2013).6
To take another example, Mian and Sufi (2011) find that borrowing against rising home
values by existing homeowners drove a significant fraction of both the rise in U.S. household
leverage from 2002 to 2006 and the increase in mortgage defaults from 2006 to 2008. How did
homeowners deploy the borrowed funds? As the paper explains (p.2134):
The real effects of the home equity–based borrowing channel depend on what households do with
the borrowed money. We find no evidence that borrowing in response to increased house prices is
used to purchase new homes or investment properties. In fact, home equity–based borrowing is
not used to pay down expensive credit card balances, even for households with a heavy
dependence on credit card borrowing. Given the high cost of keeping credit card balances, this
result suggests a high marginal private return to borrowed funds.

Knowing what sort of spending generates this high marginal private return would inform how
economists specify consumer preferences, expectations, and other inputs into consumer choice
models. For example, spend data would help distinguish liquidity constraints from self-control
problems as drivers of leveraging, which Mian and Sufi highlight as a fruitful avenue for future
research (p.2155).7
As both examples suggest, unpacking the mechanisms underlying the long-run effects of a
liquidity shock may require data on consumption and investment choices immediately after the
shock. If one can follow the money from liquidity shock to spending, it may help identify how
households use liquidity to try to improve their lots.
But how exactly one might go about measuring spending in the immediate aftermath of a
liquidity shock is not immediately obvious, methodologically speaking. There are several
challenges. Administrative data is rarely available for the right sample, timeframe, or spending
frequency, and even more rarely sufficiently comprehensive in its coverage of different types of
consumption and investment. This makes survey design very important. Yet money is fungible,
and household and (micro)enterprise balance sheets are often complex, so it may be cognitively
difficult for survey respondents to identify the effects of the liquidity shock on their spending,
relative to the counterfactual of no shock. Similarly, surveys that simply ask about past purchases
6

Now consider the opposite state of the world: say an evaluation of 12-month impacts does find that a microcredit
expansion produces larger, more profitable businesses. The mechanism need not be investment in business assets per
se (inventory, physical capital, etc.) Rather, it could be investments in human capital (training, health, child care,
etc.) that enable the entrepreneur or business “helpers” from her family to be more productive.

produce noisy data, and measurement error increases with the length of the recall period (Nicola,
Francesca, and Giné 2012). Moreover, surveys can produce biased rather than merely noisy data
if respondents have justification bias, 8 worry about surveyors sharing information with tax
authorities or a lender that “requires” loans be used for particular purpose, or feel stigma about
using debt for consumption purposes (Karlan and Zinman 2008). In short, data constraints,
strategic reporting, and respondent (mis)perceptions may all make it difficult to follow the
money.
We address these challenges by comparing results from seven different methods for
following the money obtained by borrowers subject to a randomized supply shock from one of
two microlenders in Metro Manila or northern Luzon, Philippines. The majority of marginal
borrowers (90%) —those close to the banks’ credit score cutoffs—were randomly assigned to be
offered a loan, while the remaining potential borrowers (10%) were randomly rejected. As is
typical in microlending, the loans are targeted to microentrepreneurial investment, and
underwritten accordingly, but are not secured by collateral or restricted in their disbursement.
The first method for following the money uses three questions about intended loan uses on
the banks’ loan applications. The second has a loan officer ask the borrower those same three
questions shortly after loan disbursal. The third and fourth are nearly identical direct questions
asked of borrowers, by independent surveyors, with no link to the bank, two weeks and two
months after loan disbursal. The fifth is two “list randomization” questions, asked by
independent surveyors two weeks after disbursal, that make it feasible for respondents to respond
truthfully to sensitive questions without actually revealing details about their behavior (Karlan
and Zinman 2012). The sixth and seventh use the lenders’ randomizations and the two-week and
two-month independent follow-up surveys, by comparing a listing of recent expenditures (with
no reference to recent borrowing) across the treatment and control groups.9
Before summarizing the results, we emphasize that our paper is more about demonstrating a
methodological approach to identifying spending responses than about extrapolating substantive
implications from our particular setting.
That said, the pattern of results suggests three key findings in our setting. First, respondents
report strategically. They report very few non-business uses of loan proceeds to the bank,
significantly more to independent surveyors when asked direct questions, and yet significantly
more to independent surveyors when presented with lists of statements that allow them to report
truthfully without directly revealing what they spent. Second, even when responding (more)
truthfully, answers to questions about “did you spend X or more of your loan on…” are different
8

E.g., my business did not grow from last year to this year, so I won’t report (to the surveyor, or even perhaps to
myself) that I actually did try to grow my business by investing in new assets earlier this year.
9
The randomization does actually produce a powerful “first-stage”: a substantial increase in borrowing for the
treatment (loan approved) group relative to the control (loan rejected) group. This result is not surprising, given that
Karlan and Zinman (2011) found a similar result with marginal borrowers from one of the same banks considered
here.

than the counterfactual of greatest interest to economists and policymakers. For example,
although 12% of our treatment group implicitly (via list randomization) reports spending 5,000
pesos (US$1 = 45 Philippine Pesos) or more of their most recent loan on a household expense in
the independent survey two weeks post-randomization, the treatment group is no more likely
than the control group to say yes to any of a long list of questions regarding household
expenditures greater than 1,000 pesos during the past 2 weeks (the proportion is 13% in both
groups, for an estimated treatment effect of zero). Third, we estimate that the treatment effect is
actually entirely on business investment, specifically inventory. This treatment effect can
account for the entire loan amount 2-weeks post-randomization, with even larger but more
noisily estimated effects at 2-months post-randomization.
We believe the main methodological implication of our results is that researchers should
consider collecting spending data on both treatment and control subjects very shortly after an
exogenous liquidity shock. This data would complement longer-run follow-up data; e.g., in our
setting, it will be interesting to see whether the short-run increases in inventory translate into
long-run increases, and into higher profits.
II. Market Overview
We collected data with the cooperation of two different banks in the Philippines, one in
Metro Manila (covering mostly peri-urban areas) and another in northern Luzon. Both banks are
for-profit institutions that offer individual liability microloans at about 60% APR. Loan sizes
range from 5,000 pesos to 50,000 pesos, with a mean (median) of 13,996 (10,000) in our sample.
Loan maturities range from three to six months, with weekly repayments of principal and
interest. Both banks require that applicants have an existing business, and be between 18 and 65
years old.
The Metro Manila bank has operated in the region since the 1960s. It had microloans
outstanding to about 2,700 borrowers as of July 2013. This portfolio represents a small fraction
of its overall lending, which also includes larger business and consumer loans, and home
mortgages. Until the end of 2012 the bank’s microlending activities received subsidized
technical assistance from a USAID-funded program.10
The second bank has operated in mostly rural areas of northern Luzon since the 1980s. It had
microloans outstanding to 26,000 borrowers in 2011 and offers other financial products as well.
The microloan market in the Philippines is somewhat competitive, as described in Karlan and
Zinman (2011). There are informal options as well, including moneylenders. For our purposes
the key fact is that that rejected borrowers do not simply obtain credit elsewhere: our banks’
random assignments to credit actually do produce a substantial change in the total/net borrowing
of applicants (see Section III-F below).
10

The program was administered by Chemonics, Microenterprise Access to Banking Services (MABS).
5

Our sample is comprised of 1661 marginal loan applicants who were randomized into loan
approval or denial (see Section III-B for details on the randomization). Table 1 Column 1
provides baseline descriptive statistics gleaned from loan applications. 81.7% of the sample are
women, 73.5% are married, and 32.9% are college educated.11. The average applicant is 40.9
years old and has owned her business for 6.7 years. Nearly half of the businesses are “sari-sari”
(corner/convenience) stores. 35.8% have regular employees/helpers (i.e., workers besides the
owner), and average weekly cash flow in the businesses is 4,901 pesos (a bit more than $100).
III. Methods and Results
A. Overview
To better understand how borrowers deploy loan proceeds, and report thereon, we follow
individuals from when they first apply for a loan until two months later. By that endpoint, we
suspect that most of any proceeds will have been spent; this seems like a reasonable assumption
given the high interest rates and short maturities. Along the way we use a variety of different
methods to try to get at the same underlying question: how did the loan change the client’s
spending relative to a counterfactual in which the loan was not available?

Our methods include various attempts to measure the counterfactual through direct elicitation
(survey questions). They also include a method that combines less-direct elicitation of loan
uses—by attempting to measure all recent large outflows from the household and business—with
the random assignment of access to credit. The data come from four different interactions, with
the same individual, over the course of about two months. Figure 1 summarizes the timeline and
the data collected in four distinct steps: (1) an application for a bank loan by the individual; (2) a
short survey of approved applicants at their first repayment, administered by a loan officer; (3) a
questionnaire by an independent surveyor two to three weeks after the loan application and (4) a
questionnaire by an independent surveyor about two months after the loan application.
B. Sample Creation and Randomization
Our sample is comprised of 1,661 marginally creditworthy microloan applicants to the two
banks described in Section II. Individuals applied from one of 16 bank branches at the Northern
Luzon lender, or 8 branches at the Metro Manila lender, between July 2010 and March 2012.
Each loan application is digitized by bank staff and credit-scored by underwriting software. For
the purposes of this study, relatively small numbers of applicants with the highest (lowest) scores
were automatically approved (rejected). The remaining applicants (about 85% of the pool) were
randomly assigned to approval (with 90% probability) or rejection (with 10% probability).
This random allocation of loans to marginal clients serves as the identifying instrument for
our analysis of the expenditure data described in Sections III-E and III-F below. Table 1 Column
2 confirms that the treatment and control groups are observably identical, in a statistical sense:
regressing treatment assignment on treatment strata and the complete set of baseline
characteristics in Table 1, we do not reject the hypothesis that the characteristics are jointly
uncorrelated with treatment assignment (p-value = 0.488).
C. Data Collection Step 1: At Application, by Loan Officer
The first pieces of data on loan uses come from loan applications. Applications are extensive,
and take the form of loan officers interviewing applicants, reviewing their documents, and
entering data into a small netbook computer. This process typically takes at least an hour to
complete, and includes questions on income, household composition, assets and liabilities, and
business cash flows.
The banks added three questions on loan uses to their applications at our behest. The
applicant was first asked: (1) Do you plan to spend 5,000 pesos or more of your loan on any one
household item? 12 (2) Do you plan to spend 2,500 pesos or more of your loan on servicing any
other debt? Later the applicant was asked to provide a full listing of intended usage of the loan.
The former two questions are designed to identify non-trivial non-business uses of loan proceeds,
keeping in mind that the median loan size is 10,000 pesos and that borrowers may split loan
proceeds among several different types of expenditures.
12

Exchange rate at time of surveys was US$1 = 43 Philippine Pesos.
7

This first step allows us to see how the applicants report their intended loan usage to the
banks. These data will not be very informative about true intentions if applicants believe that
their responses may affect the lender’s decision. For example, applicants might reasonably infer
that banks prefer to lend exclusively for business purposes, and answer no to the questions about
household and refinancing uses, regardless of their true intentions.
Table 2 Column 1 shows that very few applicants report non-businesses loan uses on their
loan applications. Only 1.8% report planning to use their loan on a household transaction of
5,000 pesos or more (Panel A), and only 2.3% report planning to use their loan to pay down debt
of 2,500 or more (Panel B). 13 Column 1 shows results for the treatment group only, for
comparability with subsequent analysis. Results do not change if we include the control group.
Is the low reported prevalence of non-business uses on loan applications driven by strategic
underreporting? Results below from steps 3 and 4 suggest yes, although only to a point. Before
detailing those results we examine whether borrowers change their reporting behavior to the
bank after they obtain a loan.
D. Data Collection Step 2: At First Loan Repayment, by Bank Credit Officer
The second pieces of data on loan uses come from a very short survey, administered by loan
officers to a subset of borrowers, at the time of first repayment (about one week after loan
disbursal). The loan officers asked two questions designed to parallel the key questions from the
application: (1) Did you spend, or do you plan to spend, 5,000 pesos or more of your loan on any
one household item? (2) Did you spend, or do you plan to spend, 2,500 pesos or more of your
loan on servicing any other debt?
This step allows us to check for differences between what applicants and borrowers tell the
bank. We might see such differences if applicants misreported strategically in the first step and
the main driver of that behavior was concern about getting approved for the first loan. On the
other hand, several factors push against finding differences, including repeat contracting, and any
desire among borrowers to appear consistent in their reporting behavior.
Table 2 Column 2 shows that reported prevalence of non-business uses post-loan is
essentially unchanged from the loan application. Here we find less than one percent reporting
using their loan on a large household transaction, while 2.9% report using it to pay down other
debt.14 Sample size is lower in Column 2 because this step was implemented only at one bank
and only for a short period of time. The data collection proved onerous for the bank, and the
bank discontinued it after we observed the strong similarity in reporting behavior between this
step (post-loan) and step one (application).
13

As we show in section 2 of the paper our randomization was successful and so comparing the reported loan use
intentions of the treatment and control group will not be informative at this point. The only place where comparing
the responses is useful is in columns 5 and 7, reported spending.
14
The loan officers also asked the borrowers what they primarily spent their loans on and every borrower replied that
they spent it on their business.
8

E. Data Collection Steps 3 and 4: 2-Week and 2-Month Surveys, by Independent Surveyor
The third and fourth pieces of data on loan uses come from two surveys, administered by an
independent surveyor about two weeks and two months after loan application, of both treatment
and control group individuals. Surveyors located individuals at their place of business or home
and invited them to take a survey on behalf of Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), a research
organization. Surveyors were not aware of any connection to the banks. Surveyors informed
people in the sample frame that IPA obtained a list of potential survey respondents from a
database of local businesses.15
Both surveys focus on direct elicitation of loan uses and the measurement of all recent
substantial outflows, although the second survey is a bit shorter. Both were administered by the
same surveyor. The scripts for key questions are reproduced in Appendix 1. Relative to the twoweek survey, measuring outflows at two months has the potential advantage of allowing more
time for all loan proceeds to be spent. It also has several potential disadvantages: more time for
the control group to find alternative sources of financing (weakening power), a longer recall
period (increasing measurement error), and/or more time for any short-run returns on investment
to effect spending decisions (confounding inferences about the direct effect of borrowing on
spending).
84% of our initial sample of 1,661 completed the first (two-week) survey. Table 1 Column 3
shows that treatment assignment does not significantly affect two-week survey completion.
Column 4 shows, unsurprisingly, that baseline characteristics do predict survey completion. But
Column 5 shows that these characteristics do not interact significantly with treatment assignment
(p-value on the joint test = 0.239), offering reassurance that the treatment leaves the composition
as well as proportion of survey respondents unchanged.
65.9% of our initial sample completed the second (two-month) survey. Table 1 Column 6
shows that treatment assignment does not significantly affect two-month survey completion.
Column 7 shows, unsurprisingly, that baseline characteristics do predict survey completion.
Column 8 shows that the interactions between baseline characteristics and treatment assignment
are jointly significant; raising the possibility that treatment affects the composition of two-month
survey respondents (Column 8) if not the response rate (Column 6).
The two-week survey begins with questions about basic demographics, health and savings.
These introductory questions are designed to mitigate the likelihood that respondents infer any
connection or association between the survey and their recent loan (application). The surveyor
then asked the respondent for details on any outstanding loans, starting with the most recent one.

15

The goal was to be truthful yet also mask the relationship with the specific partnering bank. The surveyors
themselves had no knowledge of the bank connection.
9

Respondents reporting a loan were then asked about their deployment of loan proceeds using
three different methods.
First, the surveyor explicitly asked the two key loan use questions: (1) Did you spend 5,000
pesos or more of your loan on any one household item? (2) Did you spend 2,500 pesos or more
of your loan on servicing any other debt? We expect the proportion of “yeses” here to be higher
than those reported to the bank, since incentives for strategic misreporting to an independent
surveyor should be lower. Table 2 Column 3 shows that this is indeed the case, to some extent.
5.5% of individuals report using a loan for a large household expense; compared to 1.8% on the
loan application (the 3.7 percentage point difference has a p-value less than 0.001). 7.7% report
using the loan to pay down other debt, compared to 2.3% on the loan application (the 5.4
percentage point difference has a p-value less than 0.001). Of course, borrowers may still
underreport non-business uses if such uses are stigmatized, or if borrowers suspect a connection
between the surveyor and their bank. Such concerns motivate our second elicitation method.
Second, the surveyor administered a list randomization exercise to elicit estimates of grouplevel proportions of respondents using loan proceeds to pay down debt or buy household goods.
List randomization is used across various disciplines to mitigate the underreporting of socially or
financially sensitive information (Karlan and Zinman 2012). The procedure asks a randomlyselected half of the respondents to report the total number of “yes” answers to four innocuous
binary questions (Appendix 1), and the other half to report the total number of “yes” answers to
the same four innocuous binary questions plus a fifth sensitive one. We did this separately for the
two different loan use questions: (1) I spent over 5,000 pesos of my loan of a single household
transaction” and (2) “I spent more than 2,500 pesos of my loan to pay down other debt.” We then
estimate the proportion responding “yes” to the sensitive (loan use) question by subtracting the
mean count of “yeses” for those who had only had the four innocuous questions from the mean
count for those who had all five questions (including a loan use question).16 As expected, list
randomization produces substantially higher estimates of non-business uses (Table 2 Column 4).
We infer that 11.5% of respondents report spending at least 5,000 pesos of their loan proceeds on
a single household transaction (p-value = 0.285), with 19.1% spending at least 2,500 of their loan
proceeds on paying down other debt (p-value = 0.021).
All told, the results in Columns 1-4 suggest that elicitation method can have substantial
effects on how borrowers report loan uses. Borrowers report more non-business uses when asked
by an independent surveyor rather than a bank, and still more when they can report
anonymously. The results suggest that list randomization, administered by an independent
surveyor, produces relatively accurate estimates of how borrowers perceive their loan uses.
These results thus far do not address the question of how borrower perceptions accord with
the reality that is most interesting to many researchers, practitioners, and funders: what did the
16

Those who do not report an outstanding loan instead are assigned the mean count of the short-list (innocuous,
non-loan use questions only) group. Results are nearly identical if we instead drop these non-borrowers.
10

respondent buy that they would not have in the absence of the marginal loan? Fungibility may
make it difficult to construct survey questions that elicit that counterfactual. For example, loan
proceeds may be used to purchase inventory in the proximate sense of cash from bank being
handed over to a supplier. But if the business owner would have purchased that inventory
anyway, the marginal (counterfactual) purchase could be something else entirely; e.g., perhaps
the cash flow that would have been used to purchase inventory is now used to purchase health
care for an ailing family member.
The difficulty of identifying the counterfactual of interest motivates our third type of survey
question: we ask each respondent to list each household and business outflow greater than 1,000
pesos from the past two weeks (type and amount).17 (Note the lack of any reference to loans or
loan proceeds: this question asks about spending more broadly.) Together with the random
assignment of loan approvals, we use responses to this question to identify the counterfactual:
the impacts of the marginal loan on consumption and investment. Table 2 Column 5 reports the
results, which show a striking lack of impact on non-business spending. The treatment (loan
approved) and control (loan rejected) groups have identical proportions (0.133) of respondents
reporting one or more household expenses >= 5000 pesos, for a treatment effect of zero (SE =
0.30). 18 For debt pay down, the treatment group has a slightly higher proportion (0.142 vs.
0.126), but the 1.6 percentage point difference is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.580).19
We find similar results, on a much higher base, in the two-month survey.20 Regarding the
base, many more respondents directly report non-business uses, whether directly (Column 6) or
on the outflow list (Column 7).21 Regarding the counterfactual of interest, when we compare the
treatment group to the control group we find that the control group has an equally high base,
statistically speaking. 22.7% of the treatment group report spending at least 5,000 pesos on any
one household transaction while 18.0% of the control group does so. This difference of 4.7
percentage points is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.210). Similarly, 23.7% of the
treatment group reports spending more than 2,500 pesos on other debt 22 while 19.7% of the
17

Without any prompts for specific expense types.
If we instead use a 1,000 peso cut-off we get an increase of 0.026 in treatment, (p-value=0.560). The cut-off at
5,000 pesos allows us to check for large household expenditures and lines up with the direct questions that are asked
of the borrowers.
19
We are implicitly using the random assignment as an instrument for borrowing over the subsequent two weeks.
The top rows of Table 3 confirms that the instrument is a powerful one; e.g., a treatment group member is 16
percentage points more likely to have a formal sector loan than a control group member.
20
The higher base could be due to respondents taking > 2 weeks to fully spend their loan proceeds, and/or to
respondents’ increased comfort with the survey or surveyor.
21
We did not include list randomization on the two-month survey.
22
It may seem peculiar that the proportion of respondents who report spending more than 2,500 on debt pay down in
the explicit question asked by the surveyor (column 6) is higher than the proportion that report this when listing out
their spending over the past 2 months (column 7). This may be due to the fact that the outflow list has a 1,000 peso
threshold, so if someone pays off debt in increments < 1,000 pesos but a total amount >= 2,500 pesos, the outflow
list would miss this, whereas that direct question might capture it.
18

11

control group does so. This difference of 4.1 percentage points is not statistically significant (pvalue = 0.291).
Taken together, the results in Table 2 highlight several key findings. Substantively, there is
little evidence of substantial non-business uses of microenterprise loans in this particular setting.
This is surprising, given low impact on business growth in general from microcredit (Angelucci,
Karlan, and Zinman 2013; Attanasio et al. 2011; Augsburg et al. 2012; Banerjee et al. 2013;
Crepon et al. 2011; Karlan and Zinman 2010), findings from a prior study with one of the lenders
here that marginal borrowers decrease investment in their microenterprises (Karlan and Zinman
2011), and mounting concerns that people “over-borrow” to finance consumption (Zinman
forthcoming).
Methodologically, we find that borrower reporting responds strongly to the elicitation
method, and that direct elicitation of loan uses does not produce evidence on a key
counterfactual—what borrowers purchase that they would not have purchased in the absence of a
loan. Rather, we identify the counterfactual using random assignment of credit access coupled
with short-term follow-up measurement of substantial outflows.
F. So Where Does the Money Go?
If the marginal expenditure financed by a loan is not on a household item or other debt
service (Table 2), it presumably is on some sort of business investment. Can we actually detect
an increase in business investment, or do measurement error or reporting biases make it futile to
attempt to follow the money with survey data?
Tables 3 and 4 suggest that our methods can in fact identify the marginal spending: business
inventory, in this case. We switch from the mean comparisons in Table 2 (Columns 5 and 7) to
regressions to improve precision, and estimate OLS intention-to-treat (ITT) models, with HuberWhite standard errors, of the form:
=

+

∗

+

∗

+

Where i indexes individuals and t time, treatment = 1 if i was randomly assigned to loan
approval, and FE is a vector of randomization strata (a bank indicator, credit score category,
application month-year, and the survey month-year). Y is an outcome measuring borrowing (to
show the magnitude of the first-stage) or spending, measured at either t = 2 weeks or t = 2
months post-random assignment. Because inferences about these outcomes may be influenced by
outliers, we present results from three different functional forms: Column 1 estimates effects on
the level of spending (in pesos); Column 2 “winsorizes” the data, recoding the top 1% of Y’s to
the 99th percentile; and Column 3 “trims” the data, dropping observations in the top percentile of
Y. We do not use log(Y) because most of our borrowing and spending variables have many zeros.

12

Table 3 shows treatment effects on different measures of Y over the two weeks after random
assignment. Table 4 shows treatment effects on the spending measures over the two months after
random assignment.
The first panel of Table 3 shows that we have a strong first stage, similar to that found in
Karlan and Zinman (2011) with the Metro Manila lender participating in this study. The
treatment effect on the likelihood of having a loan from one of our partner banks is 0.33 (p-value
< 0.001). This is measured using administrative data from the bank. The effect is < 1 due to
approved applicants in the treatment group deciding to not actually go ahead with the loan, and
to control group applicants who managed to avail a loan anyway. The remaining Y’s are
measured using the follow-up surveys. Treatment effects on measures of total formal sector
borrowing are still statistically significant but about one-half the size on borrowing from our
partner lenders, due in part to some control group individuals obtaining credit from comparable
lenders, and in part to substantial underreporting of debt that is line with what we have found in
other studies (Karlan and Zinman 2008; Zinman 2009; Zinman 2010; Karlan and Zinman 2011).23
The next panel of Table 3 estimates the treatment effect on total spending, as measured using
our question asking respondents to list all outflows >= 1,000 pesos during the past two weeks.
Depending on our treatment of outliers, the estimate ranges from 4,996 to 5,696 pesos (with pvalues of 0.059, 0.038, and 0.028). Scaling up these estimates by the difference in borrowing
rates from the administrative data (since that data is not subject to underreporting of debt), we
get estimated treatment-on-the-treated effects of about 15,000-16,000 pesos. The average loan
size is 14,601 pesos, suggesting that our two-week outflow questions do successfully follow the
money. They also suggest that borrowers spend all loan proceeds within the first two weeks,
which seems plausible given the high interest rate and short maturity.
The rest of Table 3 disaggregates spending into several categories of interest. We confirm
that lack of significant effects on household spending and debt pay down found in the earlier
means comparisons (Table 2). Most notably, we find increases in business expenditures, in
magnitudes commensurate with the treatment effect on overall spending. Disaggregating
business expenses into fixed assets, inventory, renovations, utilities, salaries, and other, we find
evidence suggesting that the entirety of the (business) spending increase is due to inventory. The
ITT estimates on inventory range from 3,738 to 6,045 depending on how we treat outliers, with
p-values of 0.005, 0.008, and 0.049. The focus on inventory may be due to the 3-6 month loan
amortization, which may be too short for other types of investments to produce the returns
needed to service the debt.
Table 4 repeats the spending analysis using data from the two-month follow-up survey. The
results are qualitatively consistent with the two-week results. Point estimates are again more than
large enough to offer a complete accounting of the loan proceeds. The pattern of results on
23

34% of those we know, from administrative data, to have a loan with one of our lenders do not report any
outstanding formal sector loans at the two-week follow-up survey.
13

spending (sub-)categories again suggests that about 100% of marginal spending is on business
inventory. There are two noteworthy differences between the two-month and two-week results.
One is that the two-month results are less precise. This is most likely due to the relative difficulty
of recalling spending over a two month period. The second is that the two-month point estimates
on total business expenditure, and inventory specifically, are much larger. This could be an
artifact of wide confidence intervals or respondent reporting. Or it could be capturing a true
multiplier whereby treated individuals reinvest increased profits from the initial inventory
increase, or obtain additional financing from other sources, to further increase inventory.
In any case, the suggestion that quantitative effect sizes may differ substantially over as short
a period as six weeks—two weeks vs. two months—highlights the utility of short-run and highfrequency follow-ups for capturing and interpreting spending dynamics in the aftermath of a
liquidity shock.
IV. Conclusion
Discussions of outcome measurement following liquidity shocks often focus on how longerrun data may be needed to measure key impacts (e.g., of investments that require longer
gestation periods, or learning). We take the opposite tack, and test seven different methods for
measuring the short-run responses.
The first method uses questions about intended loan uses on the banks’ loan applications.
The second has a loan officer ask the borrower those same questions shortly after loan disbursal.
The third and fourth are nearly identical direct questions asked of borrowers, by independent
surveyors, with no link to the bank, two weeks and two months after loan disbursal. The fifth is
two “list randomization” questions, asked by independent surveyors two weeks after disbursal,
that make it feasible for respondents to respond truthfully to sensitive questions without actually
revealing details about their behavior. The sixth and seventh use the lenders’ randomizations and
the two-week and two-month independent follow-up surveys, by comparing a listing of recent
expenditures (with no reference to recent borrowing) across the treatment and control groups.
The results suggest three key findings in our setting. First, respondents report strategically.
They report very little non-business uses of loan proceeds to the bank, significantly more to
independent surveyors when asked direct questions, and yet significantly more to independent
surveyors when presented with lists of statements that allow them to report truthfully without
directly revealing what they spent. Second, even when responding (more) truthfully, answers to
questions about “did you spend X or more of your loan on…” are different than the
counterfactual of greatest interest to economists and policymakers. For example, although 12%
of our treatment group implicitly (via list randomization) reports spending 5,000 pesos or more
of their most recent loan on a household expense in the independent survey two weeks postrandomization, the treatment group is no more likely than the control group to say yes to any of a
14

long list of questions regarding household expenditures greater than 1,000 pesos during the past
two weeks (the proportion is 13% in both groups, for an estimated treatment effect of zero).
Third, we estimate that the treatment effect is actually entirely on business investment,
specifically inventory. This treatment effect can account for the entire loan amount 2-weeks postrandomization, with even larger but more noisily estimated effects at 2-months postrandomization.
Our study highlights the value of shorter-run, high-frequency data collection on substantial
outflows following a liquidity shock. To take just two examples, if we are interested in the
possibility of over-borrowing, the methods used in this paper can be used to address the question
of “over-borrowing on what”? In the settings studied in this paper the answer appears to be “not
on consumption”. If we are interested in why expanding access to microcredit does not reliably
lead to business growth and increased profits, the methods here can be used to address the
question “is this because borrowers invest in something else, or because they invest and fail?” In
the settings studied in this paper it appears that any downstream lack of business growth is not
for lack of trying.
Going forward, it will be important to trace short-run to longer-run impacts in the same
study. For example, a longer-run follow-up on the sample in this paper will enable us to measure
whether the short-run investments in inventory produce long-run increases in profits and/or
improvements in household outcomes. It will also be important to test whether alternative direct
elicitation methods might help borrowers and researchers, zero in on the key counterfactual.
Perhaps asking “what did you spend your loan on that you would not have bought if you had not
gotten a loan?” would produce the same inferences, at less expense, than a randomized
experiment followed by elicitation of all major household and business outflows.

Notes: Means and means comparisons, with standard errors in parentheses. Column 1 includes our entire sample assigned to treatment, whether they were reached for the follow up survey or not. Column 2
includes only the small subset of clients who were asked this question at first loan repayment. This was logistically difficult for the bank, and was thus stopped after finding few respondents reporting answers
different than what they reported on their loan application (i.e., Column 1). Columns 3 through 5 include those found for the first follow-up survey (for columns 3 and 4, if the respondent did not report a loan,
they were coded as saying "no" to using a loan for that panel’s purpose). Columns6 and 7 include those found for the second follow-up survey (for column 6, if the respondent did not report a loan, they were
coded as saying “no” to using a loan for that panel’s purpose). Sample size declines from application (Column 1) to the first survey (Columns 3-5) and then to the second survey (Columns 6-7) because of
attrition. Table 2 shows that attrition is uncorrelated with treatment assignment.

Notes: Each cell presents the intent-to-treat treatment effect on two-week expenditures. The dependent variable is the sum of all
expenditures reported in each row’s category, from a question which asked respondents to detail every outflow of cash of over
1000 pesos in the past two weeks. Each regression includes controls for the bank and credit scoring band (i.e., the probability of
assignment to treatment), and application month and survey month fixed effects. Results are robust to not including the fixed
effects. All self-reported borrowing measures are stock measures at the time of the survey. Amounts are in Philippine Pesos
(exchange rate is US$1 = 43PHP). Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
