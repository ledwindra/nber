A Theory of Current Account and
Exchange Rate Determinations

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper Is to construct a two—period, two—country model
that derives the current account, the exchange rate,

the terms of trade, and

real interest rates from optimal behavior principles.

This is done by

constructing a model that uses money mainly as a means of exchange, where the
technology of exchange is flexible due to potential substitutability of time
and real balances as a means of coordinating transactions. The discussion
results in a framework that Integrates

elements of net saving theories and the

monetary approach into a unified structure, In which the two approaches are
complementary viewpoints.

I. Introduction
The adoption of floating exchange rates in the seventies was coupled with

massive real shocks and consequently with current account imbalances. These
phenomena have renewed interest in theories of exchange rate and current

account determinations. Both the exchange rate, and the current account can
be viewed as windows that provide links between different economies. Their
role is to help to accommodate adjustment to various shocks. Their behavior
can be understood better if the underlying internal forces affecting each

economy are traced out. Those forces are like an iceberg, whose observable
tip is the current account and the exchange rate. Such a structure can be
summarized in reduced form equations that describe the dependence of prices

and current account on various parameters. The equations are derived from a
number of theories that explore various approaches explaining the behavior of
the exchange rate and the accumulation of foreign assets via the current

account. However, since the various reduced form equations are not always
derived explicitly from a unified framework, the connections between the

different approaches deserve further exploration. The purpose of this paper
is to derive the reduced form equations from a detailed structure of the
economy, a procedure that will give us a better understanding of the

interaction among different theories. This is done in a perfect foresight,
optimal behavior model, where the role of money Is introduced by describing

the technology of exchange. Despite the natural limitations of this
simplified model, it enables us to trace out the various channels that are
summarized by the reduced forms, explaining them in a general equilibrium
fashion.

A necessary step In any theory of exchange rate is modeling and under-

standing the role of money. This has been the topic of Intensive research

—1—

that has yielded various possible frameworks. Among them, we find the Clower
liquidity—type and the Sidrauski utility type as possible alternatives.1 The
liquidity—type models concentrate mainly on the role of money as a means of
exchange, assuming that money is a necessary means of payment in any
transaction. Helpinan and Razin recently used this approach in a theory of

exchange rates. Although the approach proved to be a useful tool, its
usefulness is limited when it comes to explaining the dependence of the

velocity of circulation on expected inflation. This dependence might be
crucial in any intertemporal model, and might provide a possible link between

future expected policies and current prices. The utility approach (adopted by
Sidrauski) includes real balances as a component of the utility function in

addition to the physical consumption of each good. It provides a useful
framework in analyzing inflationary effects; however, critics of this approach
have found it unsatisfactory because of the lack of economic motivation for
treating real balances in a fashion similar to consumer goods.

The purpose of this study is to employ a modified approach to modeling
the use of money that takes advantage of the insights of the above two

approaches. Instead of using real balances as a component of the utility
function, this approach uses a utility function that depends on leisure and

consumption of consumer goods. The primary role of real balances is to enable
more efficient exchange and trade and in so doing to save costly resources.
Those resources might include time and capital, which would be used to

coordinate various transactions. To simplify exposition, the paper studies
the case where the exchange is time intensive.2 A possible way of capturing
this notion is by assuming that leisure is a decreasing function of the
velocity of circulation, that is, a function whose nature depends on the

technologyof. exchange. The paper demonstrates the potential usefulness of

—2—

this approach by employing it to analyze the determinations of exchange rate,

current account, terms of trade and real interest rate. The model is
developed in Section II; Section III analyzes prices and current account
determinations, and Section IV closes the paper with concluding remarks.

II. The Model
Assume a two country world, where each country specializes in production

of one good. To simplify exposition, the analysis concentrates on the case of
two periods, where the case of n periods could be analyzed in a similar

fashion vithout changing the main results. To facilitate the discussion, the
analysis is conducted in terms of a representative consumer. Consumers share

the same tastes. They might differ, however, in their endowment. A typical
consumer in the home country lives two periods. His utility depends on
consumption of goods X and Y, as well as on leisure:

(1)

u(x0, Y, L) + pU(x1, Y1, L1)

where X, Yj, Li are consumption of goods X, Y, and leisure in period I

(i=O,

1) and p is the rate of time preference. A typical consumer in the home
country is endowed in the beginning of period i with

units of good X,.

where good X is the home—produced good. At the beginning of period i, our
consumer is also provided with

extra money balances, via a transfer

mechanism. This mechanism is analogous to printing money, and is exogenously
given. Within each period exchange occurs and allows the home consumers to
trade the domestic product (x) with the foreign good (Y). The two goods are
nonstorable, and the consumer can carry wealth from period 0 to 1 only by

bonds (domestic and/or foreign) and money balances. Those bonds are issued in

period 0, where debt repayment occurs in period 1. The exchange of goods is
facilitated by the use of money or by time to coordinate transactions: the
consumer can save on the use of real balances by spending more time on

coordinating various transactions. This trade—off Is assumed to be described
by:

=

v =

(1=0,1), where

L(vi)

(x1 ' 'x,i +

•pii

(2)

0

and P,j are the prices of goods x and y in period I, and Xj and Yj
correspond to the consumption of the various goods by the consumer in period

1. v1 is the value of the velocity of money in period I. It describes the
intensity of the use of money (N) relative to expenditure. Eq. 2 states that
higher intensity of using money balances enables one to save resources and
reduce the time needed to co—ordinate various transactions.3 During the

analysis it is assumed that foreign exchange is not used in circulation. Our
economy is characterized by consumers who are distributed In various

locations, and face the problem of coordinating their transactions. The
underlying structure of the economy is that of markets centralized only for
financial transactions (bonds) and for the exchange of goods and bonds across

borders. There is no centralized exchange of goods among consumers. Such an
exchange is facilitated by shopping time and the use of money balances. Eq.

2

provides the reduced form for such a system. The asymmetry between financial
transactions and the exchange of goods among consumers is reflected in the
specification of the velocity of money, which is defined only for transactions

• that involve consumption. The approach described In the paper can also be

—4—

adapted for the case where money is needed to coordinate bond transactions.
The assumption that foreign exchange is not circulated can be relaxed, to

allow for simultaneous demand for both currencies. One way to proceed is to
consider a more symmetrical framework, in which foreign money is needed to

facilitate transactions involving foreign goods.4 Another asymmetry in the
model is the assumption that a change in velocity affects leisure, the latter

does not affect output. Those assumptions are made in order to simplify
exposition. The appendix describes the case in which the level of production
depends inversely on the amount of leisure. This allows us to analyze
endogenous output fluctuations within an intertemporal open economy model.5
lit is shown that the determinants of the current account are also the

determinants of the intertemporal allocation of leisure. The problem facing a
typical home consumer is described by:

correspond to borrowing position. The initial endowment in period 0

is

(P ' +

given by the market value of the endowment of the domestic

good, plus the money balances (j) that are transferred to the consumer at
the beginning of the period. This endowment is used to finance the consumption in period 0, the purchase of domestic and foreign bonds, and the hoarding

of money (M0) used to facilitate transactions. The initial money balances in

constraint in period 1, and it is composed of the initial money balances, the
value of the bonds, and the market value of the endowment of the domestic

good. This budget is used to finance consumption and the hoarding of money
balances (N1). It is assumed that transaction costs are nil, thus arbitrage
ensures that:

e(1+R) =

Using this condition, eq. 3a and 3b could be integrated Into a unique budget

The foreign country is populated by consumers whose tastes are identical
to those of the home country's consumers, however they produce only good Y.
Thus, the motivation for international trade comes from differences in
production basket and from a potential difference in the intertemporal

distribution of income across countries. The first gives rise to trade in
goods, the second to trade in securities. The problem of a typical consumer
in both the foreign country and the home country can be described

where I < 1, and p is the rate of time preferences.
The choice of the utility function is motivated by its ability to provide
an interesting and traceable explanation for current account and money market
behavior 8

The problem facing each consumer is to maximize utility subject to the
given

technology of exchange (L(v)). The result of this process enables us,

using world budget constraints, to determine all prices and the current
account.

The next step is to solve the consumer problem (eq. 3 and 6) for the

utility function given by eq. 7. It is clear that the solution for our consumer
of this problem depends on the realized values of variables specific to him
(like

,

To gain further insight, let us present the solution as a

function of aggregate values. This is done by aggregating the first order
conditions across all the consumers of each country. Due to the nature of our
framework, the only effect of this aggregation is that the sum of Mi across
all the consumers can be identified with the supply of money in period i,

which is given by

Eq. 9a describes the velocity of money in period o. It depends on three
considerations: the interest rate, the technology of exchange and the
relative importance of leisure versus consumption in the utility function.
The higher the interest rate the higher the opportunity cost of money,

motivating the substitution of real balances with time. The greater the

techno1ogica1 substitutability between time and real balances () ,

the

greater the use of real balance and the lower the velocity. The greater the
importance of leisure relative to consumption

, the smaller the

the weight that the consumer gives to the gain

in time induced by higher real balances.9 Eq. 9c describes the equilibrium

money interest rate. It corresponds positively to the rate of printing money
(ii),

and negatively to the rate of time preference. Eq. 9 d—e give the demand

for the goods, and eq. 9 f—g describe the dependence of nominal expenditure on

the time preference rate, the interest rate, and wealth. Notice that

—10—

condition 9a implies that to avoid a corner solution the substitutability

between time and real balances (B) should be less than

1—i

.

During

the course of the analysis we assume a non—corner solution. Notice that the
terms 8 and q depend on the elasticity of leisure with respect to the
velocity of money. To simplify exposition, we take the case in which those
elasticities are assumed to be time—invariant and equal for both countries.

is

(higher ji)

A higher rate of printing money in period 1

going to increase prices in both periods. The reason is that

higher u is associated with higher cost of using money balances in period o,
resulting in lower demand for real balances. For given initial nominal
balances (M0), prices should go up to equate the demand to the supply of real

balances. The actual increase in nominal balances in period 1 is responsible
for higher prices in that period. Higher output tends to reduce money prices
because it implies higher demand for real balances (higher output increases
wealth, inducing higher consumption and higher demand for real balances due to
more transactions). This analysis could be conducted using the wealth of each
nation as the explanatory variable, where wealth itself is endogenously

determined by the output stream. Combining eq. 11 and 14 gives us that:

Thus, the exchange rate depends upon monetary considerations, summarized
by the first component, and real considerations, summarized by the second

component. An increase in the relative home/foreign money supply (M/N*)
induces a depreciation at the same rate. Increase in the rate of future
growth of the money supply anticipated today (ii)

results

in a current

depreciation. The above results emphasize the dependence of current prices on
expectations of future policies, a point that is highlighted by the various

assets approaches to exchange rate determination. Although the above results
are derived from a detailed structure of the model under discussion in this
paper, they can also be derived from a variety of models of exchange rate
determination that are likely to share a similar reduced form.12

A possible

channel by which anticipation of future policies could affect current exchange

rate can be described in the following way: an increase in the rate of future
growth of the money supply, anticipated today, induces a higher domestic

interest rate and a lower demand for real balances. For given nominal

balances it induces current depreciation and higher domestic prices. In a
similar way, an increase in present or future output (anticipated today)
induces appreciation.

Notice that for a given rate of future money supply growth (ii)

, higher

is equivalent to a "permanent" increase in money supply. To study the
effects of a "transitory" increase in the money supply we should impose the

condition that di0 > 0 comes with d(i0 .

.i) = 0,

implying that the transitory

Increase comes with a lower interest rate. The first effect (d > 0)
induces current depreciation; the second effect (du < 0) implies current

appreciation. With the help of eq. 16 we see that for the case studied in
this paper the net effect of a transitory increase in the money supply is a

lower interest rate and depreciation. Recall that the effect of a higher rate

—14—

implies

of future Increase in the money supply (11)

a higher interest rate and

depreciation. Thus, we can conclude that the sign of the correlation between
movements of interest rates and exchange rates is ambiguous, depending on the
nature and the permanence of the monetary shocks.
An alternative presentation of the exchange rate can highlight the role

of wealth in exchange rate determination. Defining real wealth by

An increase In real wealth in the home country Induces appreciation.
Higher real wealth is associated with higher consumption and more transac-

tions. This implies higher demand for domestic real balances, inducing

appreciation. This result conforms with the predictions of the asset approach
presented by Branson et al., Kouri, and other writers.
The current account in period o corresponds to the excess of current

Income over the current absorption. Using the previous results we get that

(and income) is more biased to the present relative to the foreign country.
In such a case, the current account is the channel which enables intertetnporal

shifting of resources across countries in order to provide a more desirable

distribution of consumption. A current account surplus in period 0 enables
the home country to shift resources to the future, that is, to the less

favorable period (in relative terms). Notice that starting with a balanced

current account, a "permanent" Increase in output (X and

going up at the

same rate) has no effect, whereas a transitory output shock (increase only in

or in )

, will

induce a shift in resources via the current account (and

the world capital market) to the less favorable period (In relative terms).'5
Using eq. 16", we can conclude that output expansion (in the present or
the future) implies appreciation in both periods due to higher real wealth.
This appreciation, however, is associated with current account surplus in
period o only to the extent that the output expansion is biased to the

present. This result diverges from the predictions of the framework used by
Branson et al., which assumed that an increase in wealth should be accompanied
by present accumulation of foreign assets.

—16—

Notice that real shocks might result in correlated changes between

exchange rate, current account and terms of trade.'6 This result is in
agreement with Mussa and Stockman's findings. The nature of this correlation
depends, however, on the timing, location, and permanency of these shocks.

Moreover, there is no clear—cut sign for these correlations. For example,
present domestic output expansion induces negative correlation between the
present exchange rate and current account (current account surplus +

appreciation);

whereas future domestic output expansion (anticipated today)

results in positive correlation today (current account deficit ÷

appreciation). In the first case we get appreciation and deterioration in the
terms of trade, while in the second case the appreciation comes with no change
in the terms of trade.

A two—country model also enables us to analyze the determinations of real

interest rates and how they affect the current account. Define the real

Since consumption at time zero corresponds to a fraction 1/(1+ p) of real

income). This outcome is the familiar proposition of the permanent income

hypothesis. The role of the current account is to bridge the gap between
current income and consumption. It can be presented by

Consider the case where the home country experiences a transitory rise in

results in an increase in consumption in the home country that falls short of

resulting in a higher expected price inflation in terms of X, which in turn

tends to depress r. The same argument works in the opposite direction for Y,

mitigating the reduction in r that is induced by dX0 > 0. As can be seen
from eq. 22, the Increase in saving at home results in an increase in the

current account surplus of the home country. This is because the direct

income effect of d > 0 dominates the substitution effect of lower r. The
first effect favors increase in net savings; the second favors lower savings.
For the foreign country, the output stays the same and, therefore, the substitution effect has the dominant influence resulting in a higher dis—

saving. Thus, the adjustment of real interest rates ensures that the current
account Improvement in the home country is matched by an equal deterioration
of the current account in the foreign country.

IV. Concluding Remarks
The above analysis constructed a two—period, two—country model that
derives the current account, the exchange rate, the terms of trade, and real

interst rates from optimal behavior principles. The model uses money mainly
as a means of exchange, where the technology of exchange is flexible due to
potential substitutability of time and real balances as means of coordinating

transactions. This framework is helpful in deriving the reduced forms of
prices and current account which result from the optimizing behavior of
economic agents in each economy.

—19--

The analysis demonstrates that a useful way of understanding the current
account is by concentrating on net saving decisions.

The current account

function is to enable more desirable intertemporal allocation of resources

across countries. Thus, it depends on the (relative) difference of the
intertemporal distribution of output and income across countries. The effect
of various real shocks on the current account depends on the timing and

permanence of these shocks. The study of the exchange rate determinations
demonstrates that a useful way of analyzing the exchange rate is by considering the effects of various policies on the excess demand for money in each

country. The results of this analysis are in agreement with the monetary
approach.

The nature of general equilibrium analysis enables us to specify the
exchange rate also as a function of wealth, in a way that is consistent with

the contributions of Branson and others. Studying the Interaction between
prices and current account emphasizes that real shocks might induce a
correlated change In the exchange rate, current account, and terms of trade.
The nature of this correlation depends, however, on the timing, permanency,

and geographical origin of those shocks. The above discussion results in a
framework that integrates elements of net saving theories and the monetary
approach into a unified structure in which the different approaches are
complementary viewpoints.

APPENDIX

The purpose of this appendix is to generalize the paper's framework in

two dimensions. First, we consider the case of endogenous labor supply
determinations. This will allow us to trace the interaction between financial
considerations and the production decision in the context of an open

economy. Next, the last section of the appendix presents the general case to
which the main results derived in the paper apply.

Let us make two assumptions: first let us take the case of a small
country and second, let us assume the country has a Ricardian production

technology. Both assumptions are made in order to allow of a simple reduced
from solution. The approach considered can, however, be extended to the case
of a large country with diminishing marginal productivity technology. Suppose
that the small country specializes in producing X, with an output given by:

=

a

Lxt(t =

0,1);

(Al)

where a summarizes the input—output coefficient at time t. The time spent on
exchange activities at time t is given by:

The problem facing our consumer is to choose {x ,

in

such a way as to maximize his utility function subject to the budget
constraint given by eq. 3 , where leisure is given by A3. Let us assume that

the utility function is the same as that used in the paper. Thus, the problem
facing our consumer differs from the one analyzed in the paper In two

dimensions: First, the endowment is solved endogenously, due to the trade—off

between output and leisure. Next, the leisure is now a function of both the

velocity and the output level. Thus, eq. A3 replaces eq. 2. The first order
conditions for the small country provide us with the information summarized by

eq. 9 (applied only for the home country). The endogenous choice of
gives us two extra conditions:

Inflation, as measured in output terms, goes up with the rate of monetary
expansion.

Eq.

A8 implies also the existence of a negative correlation between inflation and

real interest rates (all in terms of a given good). This reflects the fact
o1Iy

that the money interest rate (R) depen u and p.
a in eq. A4 corresponds to the rate of technology improvement. This
equation states that if the discounted real interest rate (in product terms)
exceeds the rate of technology improvement, we will favor future leisure (L1)

over the leisure in period zero (L0). Comparing eq. A4 to eq. 22 reveals that
the determinants of intertemporal distribution of leisure are also the
determinants of the current account in the previous framework (notice that the

intertemporal technology ratio (a1/a0) replaces the intertemporal output

ratio (X1/X)). That is because both the current account and the inter—
temporal leisure decisions serve the same end:interteniporal re—distribution of

utility. From eq. (A4) — (A5) we get the reduced form solution for the supply
of labor:

The underlying forces shaping the current account and prices are similar

to the ones shaping them in the paper. The new aspect of endogenous
production decisions Is in allowing us to trace the allocative effects of

inflation on the supply of output. Inspection of eq. A15 reveals that a

higher inflation (due to d i > 0) anticipated today will deteriorate the
current account, because of the intertemporal re—distribution of output. A
higher anticipated inflation will cause a depreciation and a current price

increase because of both interest rate and wealth effects. The resultant
higher money interest rate will create a drop in the demand for money, causing

depreciation and a current price increase. This adjustment Is further

strengthened by the drop in real wealth, (dw/di < 0), which further reduces
the demand for real money balances.
The case studied in the paper corresponds to a specific utility

function. The purpose of this section is to present the general case to which
the main results derived in the paper apply. This is the case where the
nominal expenditure In each period depends only on nominal wealth, money

interest rate, and the time preference rate. The demand for money is
described by a functional dependence of the velocity on the interest rate.
The composition of expenditure on different goods in each period depends only
on the prices of the different goods in the given period.
Using the notation of the paper, such a system is described by:

This list is far from being exhaustive. Among several other approaches
we find the overlapping generation approach and transaction demand.

2.

For a related study see Dornbusch and Frenkel. They model the exchange
activity to highlight the issue of inflation and growth, where the
exchange of goods is facilitated by money balances, labors and capital.

3.

This approach can be viewed as an example of modeling the use of money
as a means of saving transaction costs, where those costs are time spent

in coordinating transactions. For a related study see Karni. A crude
example of a system that will result in a functional form described In
eq. 2 is the case where each consumer is facing a uniform flow of

receipts, which are accumulated in his bank account. Let us assume that
he also faces a uniform flow of expenditure, which can be financed only

by cash balances. If each bank transaction consumes CF time, he will

spend at least CF • v

time (per period) in coordinating transactions.

This strategy is used by Helpman and Razin for the case of a rigid

velocity. For a discussion of currency substitution in a Sidrauski type
model see Llviatan (1981). For simplicity of exposition the current
paper proceeds by neglecting the possibility of currency substitution.
Thus, the exchange rate is set indirectly according to implicit goods

arbitrage conditions. Extending the framework for the case of currency
substitution will modify the analysis in two ways. First, the velocity
of each currency will depend also on contemporaneous relative prices of
goods, whereas in our case the velocity of money will be shown to be

—27—

independent of them. Next, under currency substitution the relative
demand for each good at a given period will depend also on the velocity
of the various monies, whereas In our case the relative demand for the
goods will depend only on the goods' relative price.

5.

The current paper's framework can be extended to allow also for
Investment and for a production process that uses other Inputs (like oil

and capital). Such an extension will cause the production path, prices,
and the current account to depend also on the price path of those

inputs. For an analysis of those topics in the context of a real model
see Sach. On the output effects of money, introduced through changes in
leisure, see Claassen.

6.

The assumption of no initial indebtedness in period 0 could be
generalized without changing the main results.

7.

The assumption of identical rates of time preference for both countries

can be relaxed, allowing the current account ot dend also on
differences in taste. This was done in the context of rigid velocity by
Helpman and Razin.

8.

Analysis of a two—period current account behavior in a real model of a
small economy based upon additively separable utility can be found in

Sachs. Another related study is Helpman and Razin. They use a Cobb
Douglas version of the utility function in a Clover type model. The
approach adapted in this paper could be applied for their analysis as

well. The utility function in eq. 7 is preferred because it provides a
more interesting theory of the current account than the Cobb Douglas case.

Notice that because the analysis is conducted In two periods there is no

future" In period 1. Thus, the velocity in period 1 (eq. 9) lacks a
measure of future inflation. It could be shown that in a model with n

Notice that the assumption of price flexibility implies that the real

current account is free from monetary considerations. Equivalent
definition of the current account is as the net export of goods and

services plus transfers and net factor payments from abroad. Our
assumption of no initial indebtness implies that net interest payments
in period zero are nil.

This result is in accord with Sachs and the predictions of the permanent
income and life cycle hypothesis.

The

above results and the model presented in this paper should be viewed

as intermediate—run. This is the run over which prices are flexible and
aggregate demand effects on output may

be ignored. In the short run,

price inflexibility and demand effects on output can induce a different
structure of correlations between prices and current account. The
analysis of the current account behavior is in accord with Svensson and
Razln's contribution, which provides a general analysis of the Laursen
Metzler effect in a real model.

increase in the rate of monetary expansion for one period.
