Latin American Inequality: Colonial Origins, Commodity Booms, or a Missed 20th Century
Leveling?

ABSTRACT
Most analysts of the modern Latin American economy have held the pessimistic belief in historical
persistence -- they believe that Latin America has always had very high levels of inequality, and that
it’s the Iberian colonists’ fault. Thus, modern analysts see today a more unequal Latin America compared
with Asia and most rich post-industrial nations and assume that this must always have been true. Indeed,
some have argued that high inequality appeared very early in the post-conquest Americas, and that
this fact supported rent-seeking and anti-growth institutions which help explain the disappointing growth
performance we observe there even today. The recent leveling of inequality in the region since the
1990s seems to have done little to erode that pessimism. It is important, therefore, to stress that this
alleged persistence is based on an historical literature which has made little or no effort to be comparative,
and it matters. Compared with the rest of the world, inequality was not high in the century following
1492, and it was not even high in the post-independence decades just prior Latin America’s belle époque
and start with industrialization. It only became high during the commodity boom 1870-1913, by the
end of which it had joined the rich country unequal club that included the US and the UK. Latin America
only became relatively high between 1913 and the 1970s when it missed the Great Egalitarian Leveling
which took place almost everywhere else. That Latin American inequality has its roots in its colonial
past is a myth.

Latin American Inequality in the Very Long Run:
Myths and Realities
Most analysts of the modern Latin American economy have held a pessimistic
belief in historical persistence. That is, they believe that Latin America has always had
very high levels of income and wealth inequality, suggesting it will be hard, or even
impossible, for modern policy to create a more egalitarian society. They see a more
unequal Latin America today compared with Asia and the rich post-industrial nations
(López and Perry 2008) and then assume that this must always have been true. Indeed,
many argue that high inequality appeared very early in the post-conquest Americas, and
that this fact supported rent-seeking and anti-growth institutions which help explain the
region’s disappointing growth performance until very recently. The ubiquitous leveling
of incomes in Latin America since the 1990s (Lopez-Calva and Lustig 2010; Birdsal et
al. 2011) and appears to have done little to erode this pessimism, especially since the
recent slowdown in the region’s growth seems to have stunted that income leveling
(World Bank 2014). This paper argues that the persistence view is based on very limited
historical evidence which has rarely been used comparatively, and it matters.
Furthermore, other studies have shown that even where there is measured historical
persistence, the effects decay over time (Banerjee and Iyer 2005; Nunn 2008; Bruhn and
Gallego 2009). Why not Latin America?
The paper argues the following: Compared with the rest of the world, inequality
was not high in the post-conquest decades following 1492. Indeed, it was not even high
just prior to Latin America’s emerging industrial growth during its 19th century belle
époque. It did become high after the commodity boom during the belle époque up to
1913, but not compared with the industrial world. The history that made it a relatively

3

unequal region was the absence of a 20th century Great Egalitarian Leveling in Latin
America, something that appeared in most industrial economies from World War 1 to the
1970s. That Latin American inequality has its main roots in its colonial past is a myth.
The next section places Latin American pre-industrial inequality in context by
comparing it with inequality the world around over the two millennia since Rome. It
turns out that there was little that was unusual about pre-industrial Latin American
inequality. The paper then offers explanations for the variance in pre-industrial inequality
the world around. Next, the paper uses an estimated relationship found in the preindustrial sample to fill in the empirical gaps in Latin American inequality history from
1491 through the end of the belle époque. These predictions are then compared with the
few but a growing number of Latin American inequality facts. Next, the paper shows
that inequality at the start of the belle époque was no higher, and perhaps even lower,
than that of the United States or Western Europe. In addition, it shows that inequality in
Latin America was no higher than it was in rich industrial countries in 1913. Finally, it
reports the Great Egalitarian Leveling of incomes from World War 1 to the 1970s that
Latin America missed.

What Did Pre-Industrial Inequality Look Like in Latin America
and How Should We Measure It?1

We have no evidence documenting inequality for the Inca, Aztec or other
indigenous civilizations in the Americas prior to the arrival of the Iberian conquerors.2
But we can guess. Recently, Branko Milanovic, Peter Lindert and myself (2011; hereafter
MLW) collected what we call an ancient inequality data base for 29 places, ranging over
1

This and the next section draw on Milanovic et al. (2011).
Well, almost none. But see footnote 14 where some archaeological inequality evidence is reported.

two millennia. The sample includes four Latin American observations: Nueva España
1790, Chile 1865, Brazil 1872, and Peru 1876, although a new Mexican 1844 observation
is added to the MLW sample here. Most of the MLW observations have been constructed
from what are called social tables, sources which report average income and number of
income recipients by social class and occupation, but do not report income variance
within them.
Figure 1 shows what the ancient inequality data look like (see Milanovic et al.
2011: Table 1), where the Gini estimates are plotted against income per capita. Figure 1
also displays what we call the inequality possibility frontier (solid line), a curve based on
the maximum inequality the elite could have extracted at that income per capita. The
maximum is constructed under the assumption that everybody but the elite in such
repressive societies would have gotten just the World Bank’s subsistence minimum of
$PPP 300 in 1990 prices. The ratio of the actual inequality to the maximum feasible
inequality is called the extraction rate.3 In most cases, the calculated pre-industrial Ginis
lie pretty close to the inequality possibility frontier (IPF): that is, the pre-industrial elite
did a pretty good job at extracting for themselves all the surplus. The countries farthest
below the IPF curve – with the lowest extraction rates -- are the most advanced preindustrial economies in northwestern Europe: that is, 1561-1808 Holland, 1788 France,
and 1688-1801 England.
The inequality possibility frontier allows us to better situate these ancient preindustrial inequality estimates in a modern context. Milanovic et al. (2011: Table 1)
report inequality extraction rates for 25 contemporary societies. Brazil has often been
cited as an extremely unequal society, driven by a long history of slavery, racial

The extraction rate is not unlike an index of the percent in poverty, but where the poverty line is fixed.

discrimination and regional dualism. Indeed, Brazil’s Gini in 2002 is comparable to the
most unequal pre-industrial societies in our ancient inequality sample. But Brazil is more
than four times richer than the average ancient society in our sample, so its maximum
feasible inequality (92.7) is much higher than our ancient society average (60.6). Thus,
modern Brazilian elites have extracted only a little more than 63 percent of the maximum
feasible inequality, and its inequality extraction rate is about the same as what we find
among the least exploitative and repressive ancient societies like 1801-3 England and
1886 Japan. What is true of Brazil, is also true of contemporary Chile, Mexico and Peru.
All three have Ginis today well above the world average (Chile 2003 = 54.6, Mexico
2000 = 53.8 and Peru 2002 = 52 versus the world average = 40.6)4, but all three have
extraction rates well below the least exploitative in our ancient societies sample.
Most Latin American societies – at least those that we can document -- have much
higher Ginis today than they had 150-200 years ago. Indeed, inequality has fallen over
two centuries in only one Latin American republic for which even rough data exist -Mexico 1790 = 63.5 to 2000 = 53.8, or 15 percent lower. It has been stable in another -Chile 1865 = 54 to 2003 = 54.6. But inequality has been on the rise in the other two Latin
American republics for which data exist: Brazil 1872 = 43.3 to 2002 = 58.8, or 36 percent
higher; and Peru 1876 = 42.2 to 2002 = 52, or 23 percent higher.
What about extraction rates? As a country becomes richer, and its surplus above
subsistence rises, its feasible inequality expands. Consequently, if recorded inequality is
stable, the extraction rate falls. This can be seen in Figure 2 where the extraction rate is
plotted against income per capita for both ancient societies and their modern

4

The “modern” Ginis reported here are for around 2000 to avoid the leveling observed over the last decade
or so in Latin America.

6

counterparts. Thus, the social consequences of increased inequality may not entail as
much relative deprivation as might appear if we looked only at the recorded Gini.
The extraction rate has fallen everywhere in Latin America over the past century
or two, and in some cases by a lot: it has fallen by 15 percent in Brazil (from 74.2 in 1872
to 63.4 in 2002), by 32 percent in Chile (from 83 in 1865 to 56.4 in 2003), by 47 percent
in Mexico (from 105.5 in 1790 to 56.2 in 2000), and by 27 percent in Peru (from 78.1 in
1876 to 56.7 in 2002). While the rest of this paper will focus on actual or measured
inequality, future debates over social justice and economic development will have to
struggle with the implications of different trends in actual inequality and extraction rates.5

Fundamentals: Explaining Pre-Industrial Inequality

Next, we offer an explanation for the observed differences in pre-industrial
inequality. The Kuznets hypothesis posits that inequality tends to follow a bell-shape as
average real income increases. Although Kuznets formulated his hypothesis explicitly
with a view toward industrializing and industrialized economies, one might wonder
whether his Curve is even more apparent among our pre-industrial economies. After all, a
secular inequality upswing could be easily explained by increases in per capita income:
poor countries do not have much surplus for the elite to extract, but as income rises in
pre-industrial economies, so does the surplus and potential inequality. In addition to log
average income and its square, Table 1 includes the urbanization rate, population density
5

The extraction rate relates well to the Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) notion of elite power. They see its
maximization as a function of the expected rent which the exploitative institutions can extract (times one
minus the probability of a popular uprising) minus the cost of reducing the probability of an uprising. Since
the IPF traces out the maximum feasible inequality, it takes both the suppression cost and uprising
probability as zero.

7

and colonial status. The regression also includes a number of controls for countryspecific eccentricities in the data: the number of social groups available for calculating
the Gini, whether the social table is based on tax data, and, if a colony, whether the social
table includes the income of resident colonists. We expect higher inequality for the more
urbanized countries (reflecting a common finding that inequality in urban areas tends to
be higher than in rural areas: Ravallion et al. 2007), and for those that are ruled by
foreign elites, since powerful colonizers are presumed to be able to achieve higher
extraction rates than weaker local elites, and since countries with weak local elites but
with large surpluses will attract powerful colonizers to extract it (Acemoglu, Johnson and
Robinson 2001, 2002).
The empirical results confirm all expectations. Both income terms are of the right
sign and significant, supporting a pre-industrial Kuznets Curve. The sign on the
urbanization rate is, as predicted, positive, but since it competes with population density,
its statistical significance is somewhat lower. Still, each percentage point increase in the
urbanization rate is associated with an increase in the Gini by 0.35 points. Colonies were
clearly much more unequal: holding everything else constant, colonies had a Gini almost
13 points higher than non-colonies. Foreigner is a dummy variable that controls for two
observations (South Serbia 1455 and Levant 1596) that were colonies but where their
surveys did not report the incomes and numbers of colonizers at the top. This is therefore
simply another control for data eccentricity, and its negative sign shows that being a
colony, but not having colonizers included in the survey, reduces recorded inequality
considerably (9 to 10 points).

8

The number of social groups or the tax census origins of the data used in the
inequality calculations do not affect the Gini in any significant way. This finding is
comforting because it shows that our estimates of inequality are being driven by
fundamentals, not by the way the social tables were constructed.
Population density is negatively associated with inequality. It might have been
expected that the introduction of a dummy variable for the more densely populated Asia
would have caused the effect of density to dissipate. This is not the case, as shown in
column 2 of Table 1. The negative impact of population density on inequality seems to be
counter-intuitive. After all, conventional theory would predict that more population
pressure should raise land rents and lower wages, thus producing more inequality, not
less. Furthermore, this effect should have been all the more powerful in pre-industrial
societies where land and labor drove inequality not, as in modern societies, human capital
and financial wealth. It seems likely that this conventional effect is being offset in the
ancient economy data by two forces. First, densely populated agrarian societies also had
lower per capita income, so this may have been working against the conventional force.
Second, more densely populated agrarian societies must have had higher relative food
prices than thinly settled or frontier societies, so that nominal subsistence had to be much
higher to purchase the more expensive foodstuffs, lowering measured inequality and the
extraction rate. This force must have been most powerful during the two millennia before
the middle of the 19th century since a world market for grains did not yet exist and thus
local conditions dictated the relative price of food (Latham and Neal 1983; Studer 2008).
This second offset has important implications for comparing inequality in the laborscarce and resource-abundant Americas with the labor-abundant and resource-scarce

9

Europe, and between the densely populated highlands in Mexico and the Andes relative
to resource-abundant Southern Cone. 6
The stylized picture that emerges is this: Inequality follows contours that are
consistent with the Kuznets Curve, a pre-industrial secular rise to a peak, followed by a
fall during modern economic growth. It follows that most of the pre-industrial Third
World had probably reached very high levels of inequality by the early 19th century
before what is called the first global trade boom. However, the extraction ratio tended to
fall as income increased, which, of course, invited a European colonist to plunder where
the potential surplus was big, but where the local elite had a relaxed extraction rate.

Has Latin America Always Been More Unequal?

Has Latin America always been more unequal than other parts of the world, as
implied by Stanley Engerman and Kenneth Sokoloff (1997; 2012; Engerman, Haber and
Sokoloff 2000)? Engerman and Sokoloff offered a hypothesis to account for Latin
American growth underachievement during the two centuries following its independence.
Their thesis begins with the plausible assertion that high levels of income inequality, and
thus of political power, favor rich landlords and rent-seekers, and thus the development
of institutions which are compatible with rent-seeking but incompatible with economic

6

Rarely do even modern inequality studies assess the impact of different class-specific cost-of-living trends
on real inequality trends. We know this mattered hugely in early modern Europe (Hoffman et al. 2002) and
in North America from 1650 to 1913 (Lindert and Williamson 2014). We need to know whether it has also
mattered at any time in Latin America since 1491. When Latin America underwent her commodity export
boom during the belle époque, did the rise in food export prices in the Southern Cone serve to raise real
inequality even more than nominal inequality? Did it have the opposite effect in Mexico, which imported
cheap corn from the United States? And what about 20th century Latin American food exporters when their
terms of trade collapsed 1915-1940? This ancient issue is alive and well in debates about Latin American
inequality trends during the commodity boom and bust since the 1990s (World Bank 2014).

growth. Their thesis argues further that high levels of Latin American inequality have
their roots in the natural resource endowments present when Iberia conquered and
colonized the region five centuries ago. Exploitation of the native population and of
imported African slaves, as well as their subsequent dis-enfranchisement, reinforced the
development of institutions incompatible with growth. Engerman and Sokoloff had no
difficulty collecting evidence which confirmed dis-enfranchisement, lack of suffrage,
regressive taxation, and unequal schooling in 19th century Latin America compared with
the United States. But what about comparisons with the rest of the world, and what about
inequality?7 Oddly enough, neither the Engerman-Sokoloff team nor its critics have
confronted the thesis with inequality evidence from the United States or the economic
leaders in northwest Europe at comparable early industrial stages.
Table 2 presents inequality information for pre-industrial northwest Europe (prior
to 1800) and for pre-industrial Latin America (prior to 1880). For the former, we have
observations from 1788 France, 1561 and 1732 Holland, and 1688, 1759 and 1801
England-Wales. For the latter, we have Nueva España 1790 and Mexico 1844 taken as an
average, Chile 1865, Brazil 1872 and Peru 1876. Engerman and Sokoloff coined their
hypothesis in terms of actual inequality. According to that criterion, their thesis must be
soundly rejected. That is, the (population weighted) average Latin American Gini (48.1)
was considerably lower than that of northwest Europe (52.9), not higher.8 Furthermore,

7

John Coatsworth argues that the Engerman-Sokoloff thesis has not held up well to scrutiny: “what little
quantitative evidence there is does not suggest that ownership of land, or other assets for that matter, was
more concentrated in Latin America than in the United States” (Coatsworth 2008: Table 2, 553). However,
Coatsworth’s survey of the land and wealth distribution estimates for Latin America (Coatsworth 2008:
553, and Table 2`) reveals that the first Latin America observations are for the province of Buenos Aires in
1820 and 1838, and for Rio de Janeiro in 1830. He is not able to report any colonial observations. See also
Johnson and Frank (2006) and Gelman and Santilli (2006).
8
If pre-industrial Mexican inequality is described best by the 1844 observation in Table 3, then this
conclusion can be made even stronger.

11

the comparative inequality implications emerging for these social tables have been
confirmed recently by Rafael Dobado Gonzáles and Hector Garcia (2009: Figure 18)
using an inequality proxy – real GDP per capita relative to the unskilled grain wage.
According to their data, Mexico, Bolivia and Colombia all had less inequality in 1820
than did the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France, or even Portugal and Spain.
It is not true that pre-industrial Latin America was more unequal than preindustrial northwest Europe. Nor were incomes more unequal in Latin America than the
United States. In 1860, and just before the Civil War, the Gini measuring United States
income inequality among all household (including slaves) was 0.51, while the Gini
among all free households was 0.47 (Lindert and Williamson 2014: Table 5-6). In 1870,
and after a massive redistribution of southern incomes induced by slave emancipation,
the Gini for all households was still 0.51 (e. g. the inequality rise up North matched the
fall down South: Lindert and Williamson 2014: Table 6-4). Thus, if inequality
encouraged rent-seeking and discouraged growth in Latin America, it must have done it
even more so in northwest Europe, where the industrial revolution first started, and the
United States where (with a lag) it led the world! Since we know that high inequality was
consistent with industrial revolutions in northwest Europe and the United States, it is
unclear why it should have been inconsistent with them in Latin America.9

9

True, Latin America was poorer than northwest Europe and the United States, and poorer societies have a
smaller surplus for the elite to extract. Thus, maximum feasible inequality was considerably lower and
extraction rate were considerably higher in Latin America than in, for example, northwest Europe (0.80 vs
0.68, Table 2). While measured inequality does not support the Engerman-Sokoloff thesis, the extraction
rate does. The Engerman-Sokoloff team, their followers, and their critics all need to decide which of these
inequality indicators matters for their hypothesis and why. To the extent that political power determines the
extraction ratio, then Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson (2006) may be quite right in stressing political
inequality rather than just economic inequality.

Reconstructing Latin American Inequality 1491-1870

Initial Conditions: What Was Latin American Inequality Like in 1491?
Table 3 and Figure 3 use the Gini regression equation (1) in Table 2, and
estimates of the dependent variables, to predict income Ginis for Latin America in 1491
before the Iberian conquest, shortly after the conquest (call it 1492), 1600, 1700, 1790,
1820 and 1870. Table 3 also predicts Ginis for Mexico in 1820 and 1870. In addition, the
table reports predictions for the five Latin American cases where we also have actual
inequality estimates: i.e. Nueva España 1790, Mexico 1844, Brazil 1872, Chile 1865 and
Peru 1876. While the correlation between actual and predicted inequality for those five
cases is hardly perfect, it is positive and significant (R2=0.42), a comforting result. Table
3 implies that the Gini coefficient in Latin America prior to the arrival of the Iberians was
22.5, the lowest inequality in the MLW pre-industrial sample, and Aztec archeological
evidence would seem to confirm it.10 For comparison, China in 1880 had a Gini of 24.5,
very close to pre-conquest Latin America. Thus, Table 3 implies that pre-conquest Latin
America had modest levels of inequality much like all the other poor pre-industrial
societies in our sample which had escaped being colonized.

Extracting the Surplus: What Was the Colonial Impact Like after 1492?
Given what we know about ancient pre-industrial economies the world around,
and assuming that Iberian colonists were no better or worse at extracting surplus than

10

Michael Smith (1992: Table 12.8, p. 359) reports measures of inequality for rural Aztec society about the
time of the Iberian conquest. These are based on housing remains, and for what Smith calls “architectural
inequality.” For two sites, each sampled from the early and late Cuauhnahuac period, the average Gini is
13.1, well below our estimate of 22.5 reported in the text.

13

were the other colonizers in the ancient inequality sample (England, Holland, and the
Ottoman Turks), the answer to this section’s question is quite straight forward. Colonies
had higher Gini coefficients by 12-13 percentage points (Table 2), so the Latin American
Gini coefficient might have drifted up from 22.5 in 1491 to something like 35 in the post1492 decades. Perhaps it was a bit lower or a bit higher, but we predict that inequality
must have jumped up by about half during the first decades after the Iberian conquest.
Not only did the Iberian elite replace the indigenous elite, but, if they were
anything like the English, the Dutch and the Turks, the Iberians must have been able (or
willing) to raise the extraction rate in their favor by a lot.

The Likely Impact of the 16th Century Demographic Disaster
As is well known, European disease caused immense demographic damage to the
indigenous population over the century following Columbus’s first voyage, due to
soaring mortality rates. Massimo Livi-Bacci thinks it shrank by more than 90 percent by
the early 17th century (Livi Bacci 2006), and the recent surveys by Carlos Assadourian
(2006) and Linda Newson (2006) agree. Angus Maddison thinks the shrinking was a bit
smaller, and Table 3 uses Maddison to take the lower bound. The Atlantic slave trade
tried to substitute African slaves for decimated indigenous populations but their addition
was far smaller than the subtraction caused by European disease (except for the
Caribbean and Brazilian coast; Newson 2006: 152, Assadourian 2006: 276). Furthermore,
the African slaves arrived in significant numbers only after a long lag, and few were
transported to the once densely populated highlands where three-quarters of the
indigenous population lived in 1492 (Newson 2006: Table 5.1), but rather to the sugar-

14

rich tropics. The demographic collapse destroyed indigenous political and institutional
structures, and facilitated religious and cultural assimilation. The demographic disaster
also contributed to higher land-labor ratios, higher GDP per capita, higher wage-rental
ratios (w/r), and lower inequality.11 Assuming that only land and labor mattered in the
early colonial economy, that technology was unchanged, and that there was constant
returns to scale, then it follows that the elasticity relating the wage-rental to the landlabor ratio was unity.12 Population density fell by 51 percent between 1500 and 1600
(from 1.60 to 0.78 persons per square kilometer)13, implying that the land-labor ratio rose
about 103 percent (from 0.63 to 1.28 square kilometers per person) 14. If population fell
by Livi-Bacci’s 90 percent estimate (from an index of 100 to 10), then the land-labor
ratio rose by a factor of ten (from an index of 10 to 100),15 Furthermore, if labor’s share
was about 0.5, then GDP per capita would have increased by about 52 percent over the
century.
This analysis makes two assumptions that historians would challenge vigorously.
First, we have assumed perfect competition in factor markets, which, of course, is
completely inconsistent with the fact that Iberian colonists introduced coercive and

11

Bates, Coatsworth and Williamson (2007: 919-20). Note the demographic parallel with Alwyn Young’s
argument that today’s HIV-AIDS raises the incomes of those Africans who survive the disease (Young
2005).
12
This, and what immediately follows, is based on the conventional sources-of-growth production function
Y=ARαLβ, where α+β=1, Y = GDP, R = land and L = labor.
13
Salvucci (2010) thinks the fall in density was even bigger, 85 percent, but we are taking a lower bound
estimate here.
14
Greater economic complexity would diminish the size of the demographic disaster effects estimated here,
but not the direction. For example, if land supply was very elastic (as it probably was in the Americas) then
the impact on the land-labor ratio would be diminished. To take another example, while the assumption of
constant technology across the 16th century is analytically convenient, technological transfer from Europe
and mining development must have increased A in the formal output and output per worker expression in
the text. This point is expanded below.
15
The cultivatable land area of Latin America was 10.966 million km2 between 1500 and 1800. LiviBacci’s 50 million pre-conquest population implies a population density of 4.56. His 3-4 (say 3.5) million
estimate for c1700 implies a density of 0.31, a spectacular fall of population density over the 16th century.

15

repressive devices so that labor’s greater scarcity was not fully rewarded: slavery,
haciendas, mita, encomienda, and other institutions were used to push the wage below
labor’s marginal product (Assadourian 2006: 293-314; Coatsworth 2008). Indeed, had
“the Spaniards … been constrained to bid for [their] services, one would have
expected the real rewards to the indigenous population to have soared. There is
nothing mysterious about this: it is called supply and demand. And supply and
demand was clearly on the side of the Indians … ” (Salvucci 2010).
As Richard Salvucci notes, the logical response of the Spaniards
“would have been to attempt to defeat it. Or to put it in the terms that Evsey
Domar had raised, you could not have free labor, free land, and a nonworking
landlord class simultaneously. One of them had to disappear. And we all know
which one did.” (Salvucci 2010).
Salvucci relies heavily on Shane Hunt (1972) who in an impressive and unpublished
paper almost four decades old, described the evolution of the colonial institutions that
extracted this surplus. While Hunt’s Domar-like analysis shows how these coercive
institutions kept the wage down during the 16th century demographic disaster, his
economic analysis shows clearly that hacienda profitability and implicit rents must have
fallen, raising the implicit wage-rent ratio.
Still, the demographically-induced rise in the wage-rental ratio must have been
considerably less than 100 percent. But even if it was only 25 percent, it implies
pronounced downward pressure on inequality across the 16th century. Furthermore, it
seems likely that land concentration also diminished as labor got scarcer (and the
munifundios per family got bigger and/or land use per hacienda got smaller), so there are

16

other reasons to believe that exogenous demographic trends put strong downward
pressure on inequality across the 16th century. On the other hand, improved productivity
in mining as well as any general improvement in economy-wide productivity might have
pushed inequality in the opposite direction.
The second assumption which historians might well challenge is that the available
land stock remained unchanged in response to the demographic collapse. Since the preIberian empires had developed intensive agriculture with irrigation and other infrastructure, and since that infra-structure decayed in the absence of a large collective labor
input to maintain it (Assadourian 2006: 278-93), the effective stock of land may have
diminished, implying a smaller rise in the land-labor ratio. On the other hand, the stock of
animals soared across the 16th century, easily offsetting any fall in the land stock.16
What was the net effect of the demographic disaster on income distribution? Until
future research can test what seems to be a plausible working hypothesis of increased
labor scarcity,17 Table 3 uses it to predict that, after the first decades of colonization,
there was very little additional change in inequality up to 1600.

Rising Colonial Inequality to Its Peak
Over the two centuries between 1600 and 1790, a number of fundamentals were at
work in Latin America which would have served to raise inequality and extraction rates.
First, populations partially recovered their 16th century losses. Population rose from 8.6
million in 1600 to 12.5 million in 1790. Thus, population density increased from about
16

The per annum growth rates of livestock 1560-1620 are truly impressive with cattle 3.9-4.3 percent and
sheep and goats 2.3-4 percent, let alone beasts of burden, like donkeys, mules and horses (Assadourian
2006: 300).
17
Some time ago, Borah and Cook (1953: 39) offered some evidence that real wages of unskilled workers
rose across the 16th century.

17

0.78 to 1.14, and land-labor ratios fell by about 31 percent. Second, GDP per capita rose
from 438 to 650, or almost by half, and urbanization rose from 9 to 14.2 percent, or by
more than half. These forces imply that the Gini might have risen from 36.2 to 57.6,
which in turn suggests that inequality reached its peak in the late colonial decades just
prior to independence.

Revolution, Independence and Lost Decades
While revolution, independence and the ‘lost decades’ that followed up to about
1870 (Bates, Coatsworth and Williamson 2007) were very complicated times, and while
there must have been many forces at work influencing inequality, the ancient inequality
regression predicts that the Gini probably dropped from 57.6 in 1790 to 46.4 in 1870. The
biggest force contributing to the fall was, of course, independence and de-colonization
since the five ‘lost decades’ between the 1820s and the 1870 yielded very little GDP per
capita growth18 or urbanization. Mexico repeats the Latin American (predicted) trends, its
Gini falling from 57.7 to 44 between 1790 and 1870, and the biggest fall by far between
1790 and 1820, from 57.7 to 47.8. Ongoing research by Amilcar Challu confirms a
significant fall in Mexican inequality: he estimates a Gini of 51.3 for 1844 Querétaro,19
which implies that most of the fall between 1790 and 1870 had taken place by the early
1840s.

18

Debate over Angus Maddison’s data is intense, but some adopt his more positive view of Latin American
growth 1820-1870. See, for example, Leandro Prados de la Escosura (2007, 2009). However, even Prados’
more rosy view of post-independence is consistent with very poor growth performance (Prados 2007: Table
1.4): between 1820 and 1850, the two biggest republics, Brazil and Mexico, grew at 0 and 0.1 percent per
annum, respectively; in the 1850s, the figures were -0.1 and -1.3. Lost decades indeed!
19
In personal correspondence, Challu has described Querétaro as quite representative. For example, Challu
estimates per capita income in mid-century at about 43 pesos, which is within the range of GDP per capita
estimates for Mexico offered by Richard Salvucci (1997) and John Coastworth (2003, 2005).

18

Leticia Arroyo Abad (2008: Figure 1) uses data on wage rates and land rents to
infer 19th century trends in inequality. When her rent-wage ratios for Argentina, Mexico,
and Venezuela are weighted by 1850 populations, the resulting rent-wage ratio falls by 11
percent between 1820 and 1850, and for Mexico alone the fall is 12 percent. Furthermore,
the Arroyo Abad Mexican rent-wage ratio trends and the Mexican Gini coefficients
coming from the social tables in Table 3 are closely reproduced by the Amilcar Challu
rent-wage series for central Mexico 1780-1869. Challu’s inequality index rises by 38
percent from the 1780s to the 1800s, falls by 29 percent from the 1800s to the 1820s, and
then continues a slow downward drift during the ‘lost decades’ up to the 1860s. To
summarize, the Arroyo Abad index falls by 4 percent per decade between 1820 and 1850,
the Challu index falls by 5.2 percent per decade between 1820 and 1869, and our Gini in
Table 3 falls by almost 2 percent per decade between 1820 and 1870.

Creating Modern Inequality: The Belle Époque Commodity Boom

Latin America faced a rising terms of trade throughout the late 19th century, as
commodity prices boomed, driving up land and mineral rents relative to wages. This
happened everywhere around the commodity-exporting periphery (Williamson 2002,
2008, 2011), but it was especially dramatic in Latin America partly because the region
was able to expand its export sectors so effectively, thus to become very large shares in
GDP (Williamson 2011: Table 4.1). Since land and mineral resources were held by those
at the top, inequality rose as well. Not too long ago, the only data we had to judge the
magnitude of these inequality trends were proxies, like the land rent to unskilled wage

19

ratio or the GDP per worker to unskilled wage ratio (Williamson 1999, 2002). Thus,
when the rent-wage ratios for Argentina, Mexico, Uruguay and Venezuela (Arroyo Abad
2008: Figure 1) are weighted by 1890 populations, the Latin American average rises 7.9
percent per decade 1850-1870 and 6.3 percent per decade 1870-1900, for a total increase
of 37 percent after 1850. Thus, this rent-wage proxy implies a big inequality surge over
the second half of the century. We also have the more comprehensive belle époque
inequality evidence for the Southern Cone summarized in Table 4. It comes from two
sources: first, Ginis calculated from new evidence collected by Luis Bértola and his
collaborators (2009), and second, what Leandro Prados de la Escosura (2007) calls his
backward projected Pseudo-Ginis (Table 5). They tell the same tale: inequality rose
steeply over the belle époque. True, the Latin American weighted average reported in
Table 5 refers only to four republics and all in the Southern Cone – Argentina, Brazil,
Chile and Uruguay. Thus, the average misses the heavily populated Mexican and Andean
republics. However, a proxy for Mexican inequality trends – the ratio of income per
worker relative to the unskilled wage -- rose by about 2.8 times between the early 1880s
and 1920 (Prados de la Escosura 2007: Figure 12.1b), suggesting that over the Porfiriato
decades Mexico followed the Southern Cone by recording a steep rise in inequality.
Brazil underwent a less spectacular increase between the early 1880s and the mid-1920s,
and Table 5 reports an actual decline in the Psuedo-Gini from 1870 to 1913. But we must
remember that these years include Brazilian slave emancipation (1888) and thus a
powerful (exogenous) leveling force. Note also that the income per capita to unskilled
wage ratio rose by about 45 percent over the belle époque (Prados de la Escosura 2007:
Figure 12.1b). Furthermore, the Arroyo Abad rent-wage inequality proxy for Mexico

20

increased by 27 percent between 1870 and 1900. Assuming that Mexican inequality rose
more like the Prados Pseudo-Ginis for all of Latin America than the Bértola Ginis for the
Southern Cone, it follows that Latin American inequality probably rose by something like
30 percent over the belle époque. Applying that increase to the 1870 Latin American Gini
coefficient in Table 3 would imply that it rose from 46.4 to 60.3, making the Gini in the
1920s the highest inequality that Latin America had recorded since 1491, even higher
than the 1790 colonial peak.
Any modern analyst who believes that inequality has been always been high in
Latin America should take note. After a lull over the four or five decades following
independence, inequality in Latin America was no different than Western Europe and the
United States. It only became different afterwards. If we are looking for the historical
sources of high Latin American inequality, they will not be found with the Iberian
imperialists. .

Revisionist Hypotheses about Latin American Inequality 1491-1913

Figure 3 plots Latin American inequality trends from 1491 onwards. While the
evidence used to construct those trends may seem crude, it points to several revisionist
interpretations of, or hypotheses about, four centuries of Latin American inequality up to
the 1920s.
First, it is simply not true that Latin America has always been unequal. It cannot
be stressed enough that this is a comparative statement. Only by comparisons with other
times and places can statements about Latin American inequality offer any useful

21

meaning. While comparisons with the United States are not uncommon in the recent
literature, comparisons with the European (colonial) leaders or with other parts of the
poor periphery are rarely, if ever, made. When such comparisons are made, income
inequality in pre-industrial Latin America (pre-1880) is found to have been lower than
pre-industrial northwest Europe (pre-1800) and the early industrializing United States
(1860), not higher. If it is thought that inequality encouraged rent-seeking, suppressed
private property rights, retarded the development of ‘good’ institutions, and thus
discouraged growth in Latin America, it must have done it even more so in northwest
Europe where the industrial revolution first started and in the United States where it
assumed, with a lag, world industrial leadership!
Second, it appears that pre-conquest Latin America had one of the lowest, if not
the lowest, level of inequality anywhere in the poor periphery. It also appears that Latin
American inequality remained one of the lowest anywhere around the world until the
start of the 17th century. It can hardly be said that initial endowments and Iberian
colonization made Latin America more unequal than other places.
Third, Latin America was poorer than northwest Europe, and poorer societies
have smaller surpluses for the elite to extract. Thus, while inequality was lower, what this
paper and Milanovic et al. (2011) call extraction rates (how much of the available
surplus was actually extracted by the elite) were considerably higher in Latin America
than in northwest Europe. Whether measured inequality or extraction rates are the best
indicators of pro-rent-seeking and anti-growth institutions is an issue that needs to be
resolved since they offer very different inferences regarding Latin American growth

22

underachievement. Presumably, political inequality had an important influence on the
size of the extraction rate.
Fourth, Latin American inequality from pre-conquest to the 1920s exhibited
immense variance: indeed, Latin America exhibited more inequality variance between
1491 and 1929 (Ginis ranging from 22.5 to 60.3) than one can find between Latin
America, Europe, and East Asia today (51, 34, 38, respectively: López and Perry 2008: 23). By replacing less rapacious indigenous elite with more rapacious European elite, the
Iberian conquest appears to have raised, initially, inequality by about half. Yet, the 16th
century saw very little further rise in inequality, most probably because the demographic
disaster produced labor scarcity and thus a powerful downward offset to all other
inequality-increasing institutional forces. It looks like colonial Latin American inequality
reached its peak just prior to independence (1790 Gini 57.6: Table 3). About half of that
huge colonial rise up to 1790 was then eroded by three decades of war and independence,
followed by five post-independence ‘lost decades’ of economic stagnation. Thus,
inequality in Latin America was not much different in 1870 (Gini 46.4: Table 3) than it
was for all pre-industrial societies for which we can get the data (Gini 44.3), while it was
higher in the United States (Gini 0.51: Lindert and Williamson 2014).
Fifth, commodity booms during the belle époque pushed Latin American
inequality up to historic highs. Other commodity exporters underwent similar inequalityenhancing booms over that half century (Williamson 2002; 2006, 2011), but it appears
that Latin America had one of the biggest inequality booms.

Latin America Misses the 20th Century Great Leveling

23

After belle époque inequality forces had done their work, was income inequality
higher in Latin America in 1913 than it was in Europe and the United States? Apparently
not. While Table 6 documents a rise in Latin American inequality up to 1913, it appears
to have converged on the leaders. Table 6 reports an average Latin American Gini of 0.44
between 1913 and 1929 while the figure for the United States was 0.49 in 1929. Figure 4
plots of top 1% shares and they suggest that Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and
the United Kingdom were about the same as the US or higher. In short, Latin America
had joined the rich country inequality club by World War I, and it certainly had not yet
become the world’s most unequal region.
What is very clear is that Latin American inequality rose during the anti-global
episode between the 1920s and the 1970s, while it fell everywhere else. Table 5 (see also
Frankema 2009: Figure 6.4a) reports that the Psuedo-Gini rose by 54 percent between
1913/29 and 1970 (39.7 to 54.3). The figure is an average for six countries that supply the
evidence (the four Southern Cone plus Mexico and Venezuela) which accounted for 72
percent of the region’s 1950 population.20 Labor shares were stable or fell (Frankema
2009: Figures 6.4a-c), and other evidence is consistent with stable or rising inequality
trends (Williamson 1999: Figure 11; Frankema 2009: Figure 6.4a).21 The most recent
evidence comes from the research of Pablo Astorga, which documents stable or rising
inequality across Latin America between World War 1 and the 1970s (Astorga 2014:
Table 4 and Figure 1). .

20

The top income shares for Argentina do not conform to this pattern. Facundo Alvaredo (2010) documents
a decline in the top income share in Argentina after 1940. Still, he has no data for the years 1913-1935, and
the income share of the top rises steeply up to 1940 before the fall to the 1970s.
21
Uruguay appears to have been an exception to the Latin American rule (Bértola 2005).

24

The Latin American inequality rise from World War 1 to the 1970s offers a
striking contrast with the industrialized world which underwent a Great Egalitarian
Leveling across those decades (Williamson and Lindert 1980: 53-62; Lindert and
Williamson 2014: Chapter 8; Atkinson and Piketty 2008; Atkinson et al. 2011). Figure 4
plots the magnitude of this Great Leveling for the United States, the United Kingdom,
and nine other OECD countries (see Atkinson et al. 2011, in Figure 4, for even more).
The inequality history that made Latin America today’s most unequal region is
not what happened during the three centuries of colonialism, or the half century of early
Republican independence, or even the belle époque commodity boom. The history that
mattered is the anti-globalization epoch from 1913 to 1970. Latin America did not share
the ubiquitous Great Egalitarian Leveling, but rather continued the belle époque rise.
It’s Latin America’s 20th century inequality history which is unique, not its
colonial history, nor its early republican experience, nor its belle époque. So, why did
Latin America miss the Great 20th Century Egalitarian Leveling?
