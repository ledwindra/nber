    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper considers dynamic optimal income, education, and bequest taxes in a Barro-Becker dynastic setup. Parents can transfer resources to their children in two ways: First, through education investments, which have heterogeneous and stochastic returns for children, and, second, through \ufb01nancial bequests, which yield a safe, uniform return. Each generation\u2019s productivity and preferences are subject to idiosyncratic shocks. I derive optimal linear formulas for each tax, as functions of estimable su\ufb03cient statistics, robust to underlying heterogeneities in preferences, and at any given level of all other taxes. It is in general not optimal to make education expenses fully tax deductible and the optimal education subsidy, income tax and bequest tax can, but need not, move together at the optimum. I also show how to derive optimal formulas using \u201creform-speci\ufb01c elasticities\u201d that can be targeted to empirical estimates from existing reforms. I extend the model to an OLG model with altruism to study the e\ufb00ects of credit constraints on optimal policies. Finally, I solve for the fully unrestricted policies and show that, if education is highly complementary to children\u2019s ability, it is optimal to distort parents\u2019 trade-o\ufb00 between education and bequests and to tax education investments relative to bequests.\n\n",
