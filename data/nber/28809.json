    "abstract": "\n\nUsing a randomized field experiment, we show that health care specialists cream-skim patients by their expected profitability. In the German two-tier system, outpatient reimbursement rates for both public and private insurance are centrally determined but are significantly higher for the privately insured. In our field experiment, following a standardized protocol, the same hypothetical patient called 991 private practices in 36 German counties to schedule appointments for allergy tests, hearing tests and gastroscopies. Practices were 4% more likely to offer an appointment to the privately insured. Conditional on being offered an appointment, wait times for the publicly insured were twice as long than for the privately insured. We also find smaller access differences when reimbursement rate differences are smaller. Our findings show that structural differences in reimbursement rates lead to structural differences in health care access.\n\n",

The research reported in this paper is not the result of a for-pay consulting relationship. Our employers do not have a financial interest in the topic of the paper which might constitute a conflict of interest. The field experiment was carried out at RWI Essen, a German publicly funded research institute, which does not have IRB approvals. All ethics guidelines by the German Science Foundation were followed; the guidelines for good scientific practice are here http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/principles_dfg_funding/good_scientific_practice/. The standardized protocols minimized the time to inquire about appointments. No actual appointment was made.
