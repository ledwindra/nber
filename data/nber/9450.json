    "abstract": "\n\nAfter outlining characteristics of Japan's distribution sector, a comprehensive international comparison of it to those of other nations is presented and analyzed for underlying differences. This leads to an explanation of Japan's retail store density, which is then related to the structure of wholesale channels. Next, some details on the Large Store Law of Japan and regulatory distortion, including empirical evidence on its extent are offered. Data on the structure of the retail sector by store format and on differences among prefectures in density and format are then presented.\n\n",
