ABSTRACT
The growing spread of globalization creates a genuine need for international tax reforms. In this
we establish the neutrality of border-tax adjustments of the income tax; the welfare dominance of
residence-based over source-based income taxation, albeit at the cost of a larger trade deficit; and
the ineffectiveness of non-transitory border taxes as a means for reducing the trade deficit.

Abstract
The growing spread of globalization creates a genuine need for international tax reforms. In this
we establish the neutrality of border-tax adjustments of the income tax; the welfare dominance of
residence-based over source-based income taxation, albeit at the cost of a larger trade deficit; and
the ineffectiveness of non-transitory border taxes as a means for reducing the trade deficit.

1 Introduction
The growing and continuous spread of globalization inevitably triggers a process of international
tax reforms. One important aspect in this context is border-tax adjustments. The latter have
received an even wider attention in view of recent proposals for tax reforms in the U.S.
Reforms are typically aimed at long-run restructuring of the economic landscape. Therefore, it is
useful to analyze them in a long run setup, which ensues flexible rather than sticky prices 3.
Typically, tax reforms have both efficiency and distribution implications. Nevertheless, the latter
are not in the forefront of the issues considered here. As common in the literature, we therefor
simplify by considering a representative consumer.
In this note we analyze the implications of border-tax adjustments in the income tax and of a shift
from source-based to residence-based international income taxation, paying a special attention
individual welfare and to the trade balance. In addition, we re-examine the effectiveness of border
taxes as a means to reducing trade deficits.

2 Income Taxation and Border-Tax Adjustment
Border-tax adjustments of the income tax has received a growing public and academic attention
since the introduction of the U.S. House Republican tax plan in June, 2016. In addition to replacing
the ordinary corporate income tax with a cash-flow tax, it was proposed also to introduce border
tax adjustments (à la VAT) according to which expenditures on imports are not deductible from
taxable income, and export revenues are exempted 4. We focus on the border-tax adjustments
components of the plan and analyze its implication for the real exchange rate.
Consider a minimal Fisherian model that can serve to highlight our arguments and conclusions.
Suppose there are only two periods and one composite, tradable good that can serve for present
consumption (𝑐𝑐0 ), future consumption (𝑐𝑐1), investment (I), imports (𝑀𝑀) and exports (𝑋𝑋). There is
a representative consumer and a representative producer. There is an initial endowment in the first
period and none in the second. There is a flat income tax rate (𝑡𝑡) that applies to both individuals
and businesses. As common in advance economies, the tax is based on the residence principle
according to which residents (both individuals and businesses) are taxed on their world-wide
income, irrespective of its origin – domestic or foreign 5. As residents are taxed on their capital
3

Early on, Berglas (1974) and recently Buiter (2017) analyze border-tax adjustments in the
context of sticky prices.

international taxation.

income at the same rate whether they invest at home or abroad, the domestic real interest rate in
our small open economy is equal, by arbitrage, to the internationally given real interest rate (𝑟𝑟 ∗ ).

Suppose first that there are no border-tax adjustments. As expected in this standard model, the
equilibrium is characterized by the standard marginality conditions: the marginal product of capital
equals r* and the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution of future for present consumption
equals 1 + (1 – t) r* 6. Note that the marginal rate of substitution (the absolute slope of the
consumer’s indifference curve) is lower than the absolute slope of the production possibilities
frontier (in essence, we can say that there is inadequate domestic savings).
This equilibrium is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Residence-Based Taxation Allocation with or without Border-Tax Adjustments
Now, consider border-tax adjustments, where imports are not deductible, and exports are tax
exempt. Suppose that the world price of the composite good is unity. Because imports are not
1
deductible, the domestic price of the composite good must be grossed up to 1−𝑡𝑡 if imported, through

This specification assumes for simplicity that capital does not depreciate.

arbitrage. Similarly, because exports are exempted, the domestic price of the composite good will
1
be also grossed up to 1−𝑡𝑡, if exported. Thus, the consumer intertemporal relative price remains 1 +
(1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝑟𝑟 ∗ and the producer intertemporal relative price remains 1 + 𝑟𝑟 ∗. Hence, the equilibrium is
characterized again by the same marginality conditions as before. This equilibrium is depicted in
Figure 2, which re-depict also the former equilibrium for comparison.
Therefore border-tax adjustments have no effect on the equilibrium in this simple setup with no
non-tradable goods. This establishes the neutrality of border-tax adjustments 7.

3 Reforming the Income Tax from the Source-Based to the
Residence Principle
Israel’s tax system was by and large based on the source principle. That is, only income from
domestic sources are subject to a tax, whereas foreign-source income is exempt. With the growing
process of Globalization, especially in the capital field, Israel shifted to the residence principle in
2003 8.
The equilibrium under the residence principle was already analyzed and depicted in the preceding
section. Here we illustrate the equilibrium under the source principle and compare it to the
residence equilibrium.
As foreign-source income is not taxed, whereas domestic-source income is taxed, it follows by
𝑟𝑟 ∗

arbitrage that the domestic real rate of interest will be grossed up to
. As a result, the source
1−𝑡𝑡
equilibrium will be characterized by the marginal product of capital being equal to r*/(1 – t) and
the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution of future for present consumption being equal to 1
+ r*. That is, production is at a point, where the marginal product of capita is below the world real
rate of interest (there is inadequate domestic investment). As a result, the consumption possibilities
frontier shrinks; see figure 2.

The neutrality of border tax adjustment holds also under source-based taxation, and when there
are non-traded goods.
8
Israel’s globalization process culminated in 2010 with the joining of the OECD group, see
Razin (2018).

Figure 2: Source versus Residence-Based Taxation
Moving from a source-based to a residence-based taxation clearly enhances welfare 9. Also, it
worsens the trade deficit (in our example in Figure 2, a trade surplus turns into a trade deficit).

4 Border Taxes and the Trade Balance
So far, we did not have any border taxes (barriers to trade). Even the border-tax adjustments
discussed in section 1 were shown to not amount to border taxes. In this section, we address the
issue of border taxes.

The reader familiar with the public economics literature will undoubtedly realize that this result
is a variant of the Diamond-Mirrlees aggregate production efficiency theorem (1971); see also
Frenkel, Razin and Sadka (1991).

For Trump, NAFTA is “an economic disaster”, because the United States has increased its trade
deficit with Mexico from a $1.6 billion surplus in 1993 (the year prior to NAFTA’s
implementation) to $63.2 billion in 2016. In part, the US-Mexico trade balance reflected a weak
peso after it was weakened by the uncertainty over the future of US-Mexico bilateral trade
relations. To reverse it, Trump’s solution is to abolish NAFTA.
Policy makers often justify export subsidies and import tariffs by their improving effects on the
trade balance. On the other hand, in standard international trade theory, we teach the Lerner’s
(1936) Symmetry Theorem, according to which export taxes (rather than subsidies) and import
tariffs have identical effects on resource allocation. In his analysis Lerner explicitly abstracted
from intertemporal aspects. The apparent puzzle is resolved once a distinction is made between
temporary and permanent trade taxes in an explicitly intertemporal model. Razin and Svensson
(1983) show that only a temporary import tariff improves the trade balance, and only a temporary
export tax deteriorates it. However, fully persistent import tariffs or export taxes have an identical
effect on the trade balance, as in Lerner’s Symmetry. Furthermore, to the first approximation,
border taxes neither improve nor deteriorate the trade balance. The reason for this result is that
temporary trade taxes, in contrast to permanent trade taxes, result in changes in intertemporal
relative prices, and hence induce substitution between present and future goods. Therefore, they
do affect savings and investment behavior.

5 Conclusion
In looking at residence treatment of companies, as opposed to individuals the issues are: (1) A US
company may have shareholders who are not US resident individuals; and, (2) The US residencebased corporate tax is that company residence is endogenous, leading to corporate inversions.
