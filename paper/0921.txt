International Interest-Rate and Price-Level Linkages under
Flexible Exchange Rates: A Review of Recent Evidence

Abstract

In an open economy, the scope for activist stabilization policy depends

on the nature of the linkages between domestic and international markets for

goods and assets. Two important relationships--purchasing power parity and
uncovered interest-rate parity- -have received extensive empirical attention

in recent years and are fundamental building blocks of several empirical ex-

change rate models. This paper reviews and extends recent econometric findings
on these two classical parity relationships and on their corollary, the
international equality of expected real interest rates.

Econometric tests assuming rationality of expectations are on the whole

unfavorable to the classical parity relationships: with few exceptions, they
are strongly rejected. A central theme in the review of empirical work is
the conditional heteroskedasticity of inflation and exchange rate forecast
errors and the bias this statistical problem may impart to tests of inter-

national parity relationships. The paper proposes and implements a test for
conditional heteroskedasticity which in many cases produces strong evidence
that the problem is indeed important.

Introducti on

International linkages between goods and asset markets are the key

factors in exchange rate determination. The scope for activist stabilization policy depends on both the nature of the equilibrium implied by these

linkages and the speed with which equilibrium is attained. Two important
re'ationships--purchasing power parity, which links the exchange rate to
relative national price levels, and uncovered interest-rate parity, which
links the expected future path of the exchange rate to relative nominal
interest rates--have received extensive empirical attention in recent
years and are main building blocks of several empirical exchange rate mo-

dels.'' The purpose of this paper is to review and extend recent empirical
evidence on these classical parity relationships within a rationalexpect at ions framework.

When an economy is small and both classical parity relations hold
even in the short run, monetary policy cannot influence the ex ante real rate

of interest. Insofar as the ex ante real rate is an important determinant of
saving and investment decisions, an important channel for stabilization

policy disappears.' In theoretical models of Dornbusch (1976) and Mussa
(1982), temporary price-level stickiness allows money to influence the real
interest rate in the short run even though uncovered parity holds exactly.
Portfolio-balance models of exchange-rate determination (such as those of
Branson (1979) and Girton and Henderson (1977)), stress imperfect substitu-

tion between bonds of different currency denomination. In these models,
central banks can influence real interest rates if they can alter relative
outside debt supplies.

As emphasized by Roll and Solnik (1979), among others, the classical

parity relations need not hold in a setting of uncertainty and risk aversion,
even when prices are fully flexible and agents efficiently exploit all welfare—

augmenting arbitrage

opportunities. Unless at least one parity relationship

fails, monetary policy cannot affect the expected real rate of interest; but

the

invalidity of a parity condition does not, in itself, imply that monetary

policy has this power (see Henderson (this volume) and Obstfeld (1982b)). Thus,
the series of tests performed below is at best a single component of a more
extensive inquiry into the role of monetary policy in the open economy.
A central theme in our review of empirical work is the conditional

heteroskedasticity
bias

this

of inflation and

exchange rate forecast errors, and the

econometric problem may impart to tests of international parity

relationships. Below, we propose and implement a test for conditional
heteroskedasticity which in. many cases produces strong evidence that the
problem is indeed important.

The paper is organized as follows. Section I reviews the classical
parity conditions and examines the recent behavior of bilateral ex post real
interest rate differentials between the United States and the United Kingdom,

Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and Japan. Section II carries out bilateral tests
of ex ante real interest rate equality between the U.S. and

countries. Section III is devoted

rate

these

to empirical tests of uncovered interest-

parity. Finally, Section IV tests the hynothesis that relative pur-

chasing power

parity has held ex ante during the recent era of exchange

rate flexibility.

Classical Parity Relationships and Real Interest Rates

To facilitate formal discussion of the classical naritv relations, we

introduce the following notation:

=

price

P = price

level in the "home" country

at

the end of period t;

level in the "foreign" country at the end of period t;

the exchange rate at the end of period t, defined as the home—

St

currency price of foreign currency;
Rk

ln(l +

is the foreign-country k-period nomi-

where

nal interest rate at the end of period t;
Etc.) =

Conditional

expectation operator, based on information avail-

able at the end of period t.

Purchasing power parity (PPP), in its relative form, states that the
rate at which the relative price of two currencies changes over time must

equal the difference between the national inflation rates. The doctrine
of PPP has a long intellectual history, which is surveyed by Frenkel (1976,

1978). Using the foregoing notation, the PPP relation may be written as

ln(St/St1) =

ln(P/Pt

) -

ln(P/P1).

(1)

An implication of (1) is that relative PPP must be expected to hold ex ante,
that is, for any k,

Et[ln(Stk/St)] En(Pk/P) —

ln(P/Pp].

(2)

The ex ante relative PPP condition (2) is weaker than (1), of course. 1agee (1978)

4

and Roll (1979) have suggested an "efficient markets" interpretation of ex
ante PPP for a world with low transport costs.

Uncovered interest-rate parity (UIP) states that the nominal interest differential between similar bonds denominated in different currencies
must equal the expected change in the logarithm of the exchange rate over

the holding period. This explanation of international differences in
nominal interest rates is associated with Fisher (1930). UIP implies that
for any k,

=

(3)

Et[ln(St+kISt)].

Condition (3) must hold when bonds differing only in their currencies of
denomination are perfect substitutes in investors' portfolios.
Define the expected or ex ante k-period real interest rates for the

home and foreign countries by

rk
E

-

Et{ln(Pt+k/Pt)],

(4a)

—

Et{1n(P+k/P)].

(4b)

By combining (2) and (3) with (4a) and (4b), we find that

rk =

-

Thus, under ex ante relative PPP and uncovered interest-rate parity, cx

ante real rates of interest must he equalized internationally. The
classical parity relationships imply that policymakers in a sriall open

economy cannot affect domestic economic activity through financial policy
measures aimed at influencing the expected real interest rate.
Figures 1 through 5 plot monthly series of ex post one—month real interest
rate differentials between the United States and the United Kingdom, Germany,

Switzerland, Canada, and Japan. The series begin in January 1976 and are based on
wholesale price index inflation rates and one-month

Eurocurrency

deposit rates.

Because the figures use nonoverlapping monthly data involving one-monthahead forecasts, the

deviations

from ex post real rate equality should be

serially uncorrelated and trendless if agents' expectations are rational and

real rates are equal across countries ex ante. All five figures suggest some
degree of both serial dependence and trend, however. Ex post real rates in
both the U.K. and Germany, for example, appear to have been on the whole
above those in the U.S. over the period lasting from roughly July 1977 to

December 1979. Between early 1976 and mid-1978, Swiss and Japanese ex post
real rates were persistently above those in the U.S. The figures show a
pronounced rise in U.S. ex post real rates relative to those in the five other
countries beginning around the end of 1980.
While the figures are suggestive of the existence of ex ante real interest
rate differentials over the period since January 1976, conclusive evidence can

be provided only by econometric tests. e now turn to these.

6

II. The Equality of Ex Ante Real

Interest

Pates

The equality of ex ante real interest rates across countries has been
tested in papers by Hodrick (1979) and Mishkin (1982). Hodrick (1979), using
monthly data on three-month rates, performs bilateral tests to compare ex ante
real rates in the United States and four other OECD countries over the period o'

generalized floating. He concludes that the empirical record, though mixed,

is

not inconsistent with the validity of condition (5). Mishkin (1982) carries out
multilateral tests of equality using quarterly data for the U.S. and six other
OECD countries. Over both the 1967:11 to 1979;iI and 1933.: 11 to 1979:11 sample
periods, he obtains strong rejections of the hypothesis that ex ante real
interest rates in the seven countries were equal.
In this section we test equation (5) taking into account the possible

dependence of the conditional covariances of relative inflation forecast

errors on nominal interest differentials, Such dependence induces a heteroskedasticity problem which invalidates hypothesis tests unless standard

errors are estimated in an appropriate manner. Below, we establish the
presence of a conditional heteroskedasticity problem and then use appropriate
estimators to conduct a test similar to one of Hodrick's (1979).

The results,

based on monthly data, are on the whole unfavorable to the hypothesis that expected

real interest rates have been equalized internationally in recent years.

A Test of the Hypothesis

The assumption of rational expectations yields a simple bilateral test
of the hypothesis that ex ante real rates are equal across countries. Let

and

denote the realized inflation rates in the home and foreign

between the end of period t and the end of period t+k.

Then

t+k =

Et[1n(P+k/P)] +

E[mn(P+k/P)]

where Ut+k and Utk are mean-zero inflation forecast errors uncorrelated
with any variables observed by the market by the end of period t.

Because

subsequent forecast errors are not part of that information set, E(ut+kut+k_j)J

k even though E(ut+kut+k )

may be estimated consistently by ordinary least squares (OLS). A test of

the hypothesis [a b] =

While OLS

is

consistent when applied to equation (8), it is generally

8

inefficient relative to an instrumental_variables estimator of the type

discussed by Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1982) and by Hansen (1982).J

Because ek is orthogonal to any variables in agents' information set at
time t, many instrumental variables are available.

Below, we use third-country

interest rates as additional instruments to estimate the parameters of (8)

the two-step two-stage least squares (2S2SLS) technique described by
Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (l982).!

(11)

the variance-covariance matrix E(ee), formed

using the residuals from a first-step, consistent estimation of (8) (by OLS,

say). The matrix

(12)

T[QX(XEX)1XQ]1

provides a consistent estimate of the asymptotic covariance
in

matrix of (d -

d)

this special case. (The usual textbook formula for the asymptotic covariance

matrix of the two-stage least squares estimator (see Dhrymes (1974)) is based
on assumption (10) and the assumption that a.

0 for j

> 0.)

Formula (12) is used by Hodrick (1979) to calculate the asymptotic confi-

dence ellipse for OLS estimates of (8). But (12) is not justified, even in
the OLS case, unless the conditional covariances of forecast errors with respect to lagged interest differentials are constants.21 Condition (10) would

be valid if the variables included in X were all strictly exogenous; hut
that is certainly not the case here.-'

The validity of (10) is thus an issue

of considerable importance in constructing hypothesis tests concerning the

coefficients of (8). Belpw, we describe and implement a test of (10).

When (10) fails, estimation of the matrix ? is more involved. Hansen

(1982) suggests the following procedure. As before, generate estimates e of
the residuals of (8) using some consistent (but not necessarily efficient)

estimation procedure, for example, OLS. Then,

s()

calculate a consistent estimate

of the spectral density matrix of the vector stochastic process {Xe),

s()

=

Eexp(-it) (XeeX).

(13)

10

A

consistent estimate of

consistent covariance

is

provided

by 2Ts(0). This heteroskedasticity-

matrix estimator is convenient, as it does not require

detailed specification of either the nature of the heteroskedasticity or

the nature of the serial correlation in the residuals of (8).

A Test of Conditional Homoskedasticity

To determine the appropriate estimator for the matrix 1 in (9), the

empirical validity of assumption (10) must be examined. Here, we test (10)

for the casej = 1.

E(e+kIXt)

In that case, (10) asserts that

(14)

02

a constant, so that the forecast error e÷k is conditionally homoskedastic
with respect to time-t values of the instrumental variables. Rejection of (14)
is clearly a sufficient indication that formula (12) is inappropriate and
may lead to faulty inferences.
Since our ultimate goal is to test whether a = 0 and b =

in (8), it

1

is reasonable to test for conditional heteroskedasticity under the tentative assumption that the null hypothesis of ex ante real interest rate equal-

ity is valid. That assumption implies that ek is simply the composite
forecast error

-

+

which is obervable. By the properties

of conditional means, the random variable

information set generated by

(15)

y = 0 is a test of conditional homoskedasticity.

Because tltk is uncorrelated with the regressors in (15) (all of which are
included in the information set generated by instrumental variables dated t

or earlier), OLS yields consistent parameter estimates. But 2S2SLS again
yields an efficiency gain in general. Any variables in the information set

generated by x

may be used as instrumental variab1es.--'

The foregoing test is similar in spirit to one proposed by White (1980)

for cross-sectional estimation environments. White suggests regressing

estimated equation residuals on cross-products of regressors. His procedure
thus imposes no a priori coefficient constraints. The present setting , however,
jS

one in which a simple null hypothesis is to be tested. Absence of conditional

heteroskedasticity when the null is imposed is clearly necessary if formula
(12) is to lead to valid inferences.

Table I contains the homoskedasticity test results based on monthly

data. Five countries--the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and
Japan--are compared with the United States in the tests of ex ante rea' inter-

est rate equality carried out below. Choosing an appropriate price index and

interest rate is in itself an issue of considerable importance. Thus, the tests
are performed for both consumer price index (CPI) and wholesale price index (WPI)
inflation rates and for three nominal interest rates, the one-month and threemonth Eurocurrency rates and a domestic three-month money-market

rate.' All

the resulting possibilities are represented in Table I.-'

these results contradict the simplifying assumptions under which formula

used to obtain the test results analyzed below.

Empirical Results

Tables 2a, 2b, and 2c report the results of bilateral tests of equality
between the U.S. real interest rate and those of the U.K., Germany, Switzerland,

Canada, and Japan.' Except in the U.K. and Japanese cases, equality is strongly
rejected for all combinations of price index and interest rate.

The

rejections in tests using onshore money-market interest rates (Table
2c) may in some cases be plausibly ascribed to the existence or prospect

of capital controls, However, the rejections are almost equally strong
when Eurocurrency interest rates are used in place of money-market rates;
and arbitrage between differently denominated Eurocurrency deposits has
not been restricted.---' On the whole, it seems difficult to explain the
rejections of real interest rate equality by appealing to institutional

factors that hinder international movements of capital.
In the case of the U.K., the evidence ison the whole very
favorable to the hypothesis that ex ante real rates in the U.S. and U.K.
have been equal during the recent years of floating exchange rates.

case and is quite high in the others, the large size of the estimated
constant term (a) relative to its estimated standard error is often the

cause. In contrast, the estimated slope coefficient (b) is, in half the
cases, within a standard deviation of unity. This evidence is consistent with
the existence of a constant ex ante real interest differential

between the U.S. and the U.K. The evidence therefore suggests that real interest rates in the two countries, though possibly different, are closely linked.

Tests for Japan using CPI inflation rates and Eurocurrency interest
rates support the hypothesis of real interest rate equality.

When WPI in-

flation rates are used in defining real interest rates, however, the hypothesis is easily rejected.

Use of the CPI inflation rate together with

the domestic money-market nominal interest rate yields a chi-square statistic
that is quite close to the critical value of 5.99.
An interesting feature of the results is that nominal interest differentials have significant explanatory power in equations

with the CPI inflation

differential as the dependent variable, but do not usually help in forecast-

ing relative WPI inflation rates. The U.K. is again an exception in this
respect: Nominal U.S.-U.K. interest differentials are significant (and relatively unbiased) predictors of CPI and WPI inflation rates. The greater
importance of the interest differential in ci regressions is not surprising,

for the expected future CPI is probably a better measure of the anticipated
future "real" value of money to consumers than is the expected WPI.
The tests demonstrate that ex ante real interest rate equality is

often rejected decisively over the recent floating exchange rate period.
In an attempt to shed light on the reasons

III. Expectations and Nominal Interest Differentials

The hypothesis that expected exchange-rate movements

offset nominal

interest differentials so as to equalize expected nominal yields internationally has been tested extensively.

Work in this area by Frenkel (1981)

generally supports the view that uncovered interest-rate parity (UIP) has
held quite closely over the period of generalized

floating. However, a number

of other studies reject the same hypothesis quite strongly (see Bilson (1981),
and
Cumby and Obstfeld (1981), Ceweke and Feige (1979), Hakkio (1981), Hansen

Hodrick (1980, 1983), Hsieh (1982), and Longworth (1981), among others).
We discuss below some econometric issues

that arise in tests of UIP.

Among these, once again, is the problem of conditional heteroskedaStiCjtY,
which is found to be important in the recent

data. Tests of UIP which take

this problem into account are performed, and these provide strong evidence
against that hypothesis.

A Test of the Hypothesis

In the absence of default risk or transaction costs, covered interest
arbitrage equates the forward premium on

foreign exchange to the nominal

interest differential between home- and foreign-currencY bonds. Keynes
(1923) provides the classic exposition.

ln(S).

(16)

15

Empirical studies such as Frenkel and Levich (1975,1977,1981), McCormick (1979),

and Marston (1976) show that (16) holds quite closely in the Eurocurrency
market, where the interst-bearing assets being compared have identical default
and political risk characteristics.

If UIP holds, then (3) and (16) imply that

Etln(St+k)] =

(17)

ln(Fkt)

or, equivalently, that

ln(St+k) =

ln(Fkt)

(18)

÷ Vt+kl

where Vt÷k the k-period forecast error ln(St÷k) -

Et[ln(St÷k)I,

has mean zero

and is uncorrelated with information available at the end of period t.

Ac-

cording to (18), the logarithm of the forward rate is an unbiased predictor
of the future spot rate, and one-period ahead forecast errors (k = 1) are
serially uncorrelated. When 1.IIP fails, (17) becomes

E{ln(S÷k)] =

where

ln(Fkt)

+

(19)

is a risk premium which may fluctuate through time and may be serially

correlated. Recent theoretical work shows that when asset holders are risk
averse, market efficiency is consistent with the existence of a nonzero,
possibly time-varying, risk premium (see, e,g., Frankel (l979b), Grauer, Litzenberger, and Stehie (1976), Hodrick (1981), Kouri (1977), Stockman (1978), and Stulz

denominated in different
(1981)). When a nonzero risk premium exists, bonds

16

currencies are imperfect substitutes in portfolios.

The empirical impli-

cations of imperfect asset substitutability are that ln(Fkt) is not in
general an unbiased predictor of ln(St+k)
error ln(St+k) -

ln(Fkt)

and that the forward forecast

need not be uncorrelated with information avail-

able to the market at time t.

Frenkel (1981) tests UIP by estimating the parameters of the equation

ln(St+i) = a + b

(20)

ln(Fi) +

using monthly data (sampled from June 1973 to July 1979) on the spot and
one-month forward dollar prices of the pound sterling, the French franc, and
the Deutschemark.

These tests, which involve the U.S. dollar's exchange rate against the

Canadian dollar, the Swiss franc, and the Deutschemark, cannot reject
hypothesis that unit roots are present in the univariate autoregressive representations Of the logarithms of spot

and forward rates. The Meese_Siflgletofl

17

findings suggest that the possibility of nonstationarity needs to be ta}en
seriously in designing and evaluating hypothesis tests involving exchange
rates.

A procedure that often avoids the unit—root problem is to test whether

a = 0 and b = 1 in the equation

ln(St+k/St)

a + b ln(Fkt/St) +

(21)

Vt+k.

Under the hypothesis of UIP, (21) is equivalent to (20), and states that the

k-period forward premium is the markets expectation of the change in the
logarithm of the spot rate over the next k periods.

Like the tests cited

above as rejecting UIP, the test just described works in terms of first

differences rather than levels. Thus, the asymptotic theory used in testing
is more likely to be justifiable.
Equation (21) is estimated below, and the hypothesis that a = 0 and

b =

1

is tested. The tests are bilateral (unlike Bilsonts (1981)), but

expand Frenkelts (1981) information set by using third—currency forward premia

as in-

This yields

parameter estimates more efficient than those produced by OLS, and so a more

stringent test of the null hypothesis. Like Hansen and Hodrick (1980), we use
weekly data on three-month forecasts.

A Test of Conditional Homoskedasticity

Tests of UIP have almost universally assumed that the conditional covariances of forecast errors do not depend on lagged forward prernia.' Because

18

the forward premium is not a strictly exogenous variable, this assumption
may be false, in which case the customary standard-error estimators have

no asymptotic justification. As in the previous section, it is therefore
of interest to test the conditional homoskedasticity assumption formally
under the null hvnothesis that flIP holds.

This can once again he done by

Ct+k

Under conditional homoskedasticitv, the exnected
value of v2t+k conditional on
forward premia observed at time t

is a constant. Thus, we should

find that B = y = 0 in (22). As before, any variable in the conditioning
set may be used as an instrumental variable in forminc 2S2SLS estimates of (22).

Table 3 reports the results of testing the conditional homoskedasticity of

three-month forward rate forecast errors.1' The tests involve the U.S.
dollar's exchange rate against the pound sterling, the Deutschernark, the

Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, and the Japanese yen. Weekly data running
from 7 January 1976 to 24 June 1981 are employed. The data are aligned to
19/

account for timing problems caused by bank holidays and weekends.—

In four of five cases, the null hyDothesis of conditional homoskedas-

ticity is strongly rejected. For the Canadian dollar, there is weak evidence against conditional homoskedasticity. The results suggest that a heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimator should be used in conducting hypothesis tests on the coefficients of equation (21).

coefficients equal zero. The results of this test are reported in Table
5. The equations were estimated by OLS, but the standard errors were
calculated using a heteroskedasticity-consistent technique.

Rejection at the 5 percent level again occurs in all cases except

that of Germany. Thus, the results of the present test are quite
similar to those of Table 4.

In addition, most of the estimated constant

terms (Canada is the exception) are quite insignificant.

None of the re-

jections in Table S appears to be caused exclusively by the large size of

an estimated constant tern relative to its standard error, Note that
while the present tests are unable to reject UIP for dollar and Deutschemark deposits, tests by Hansen and Hodrick (1980) using a different data
sample do reject that hypothesis.

While the two tests performed above cast

considerable doubt on

the hypothesis of perfect asset substitutability,

their results should be

interpreted with caution. First, political uncertainties may have introduced
an element of default ris.k into forward transactions during the sample pen—

od. A second issue is the so-called "peso problem" (Krasker 1980), which is

essentially a problem of finite-sample inference. If agents, over some
significant time period, expect a major central bank intervention which does
not materialize, nonoverlapping forward forecast errors will be correlated in
the sample even if the expectation of intervention is rational in the light

of past central bank behavior. While agents would be correct on average
given an infinite sample containing infinitely many such episodes, the

econometrician has only a finite history at her disposal. The dramatic
Federal Reserve-Buridesbank interventions in the fourth quarters of 1978

and 1979 are examples of the type of event which, if incorrectly anticipated
ex post, may give rise to a spurious correlation in nonoverlapping forecast errors.

IV. Exchange Rates and National Price Levels

The absolute version of the purchasing power parity (PPP)

doctrine has not

fared well in econometric tests on recent data, at least not in tests involving

the U.S. (see, e.g., Frenkel (1981) and Krugman (1978)). Figures 6 through 10
display the time series of first differences of the real exchange rates of the
U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and Japan against the U.S. The real
exchange rate is defined as the dollar "value" of the foreign WPI divided by

the U.S. WPI. The figures reveal that for all countries, the floating-rate
period has been a period of much higher real exchange-rate variability

vis--vis the U.S. than was the Bretton Woods era.—' The increase in the
amplitude of deviations from PPP begins abruptly with the adoption of flex22/

ible rates.

Here, we test whether relative PPP holds ex ante, that is, whether

expected exchange-rate depreciation reflects

the expected inflation differ-

ential between the home and foreign countries.

If ex ante PPP does not hold, ex

ante real interest rates will generally differ internationally.

As Magee (1978)

and Roll (1979) observe, ex ante PPP is under certain assumptions a consequence

of the efficiency of international commodity

markets. Both Roll (1979) and

Frenkel Cl981) present evidence that changes in real exchange rates are
serially uncorrelated, and thus possess a key property of forecast-error
series.

A Test of the Hypothesis

To design a test of ex ante relative PPP we return to equation (2).
By combining (2) with (6a) and (6b) we obtain the equation

the null hypothesis for a three-month forecasting horizon were also performed, but these are not reported as they only reinforce the message of
Table 6.

That message is that expected exchange rate changes have been poor and
biased predictors of relative inflation rates over the years of generalized

floating. The hypothesis a = 0 and b =

1

is decisively rejected for all

countries, regardless of the price index used. Further, the estimated
slope coefficients are almost always insignificant and frequently of the

wrong sign. The one exception to this occurs in the case of the dollarDeutscheinark rate, where we find that the expected depreciation rate does

help forecast the U,S.-Cerman CPI inflation differential.
Table 7 uses the adjusted Q statistic of Ljung and Box (1978) to test
whether real exchange rate changes have been serially uncorrelated in recent
years. The test statistics, which are computed for twelve lags using monthly data,
confirm the Roll-Frenkel finding that real exchange rate changes are not

serially correlated. Only in the Canadian case can the null hypothesis of
no serial correlation be rejected at better than the 20 percent significance

level. While the foregoing evidence is supportive of ex ante relative PPP,

the results of Table 6 are strongly at variance with that hypothesis. On
balance, it seems reasonable to conclude that the "efficient markets" version
of relative PPP has not characterized the recent ex?erience with floating
rates.

Conclusion

This paper has studied the interplay among price levels, interest
rates, and exchange rates over the recent period of managed exchange-

rate flexibility. Attention was focused on the two classical parity
conditions that link prices and nominal interest rates internationally
and on their corollary, the international equality of ex ante real

rates of interest. Econometric tests of these propositions within a
rational-expectations framework provided significant evidence against

theiri.

As a by-product of the investigation, we found that inflation and exchangerate forecast errors appear to be conditionally heteroskedastic.
ls'hen monetary disturbances are dominant, the classical parity

relationships may be a reliable guide to the comovements of nominal

macro-variables. But the past decade has been characterized by
moderate inflation coupled with substantial real disturbances. In
such circumstances, the classical conditions appear to be too simple
and aggregative to provide an adequate explanation of macroeconomic
events in a world of differentiated commodities and assets.

Whether the failure of the parity relations has conferred monetary
autonomy on small open economies is an entirely distinct question.
Further theoretical and empirical research is needed before a confident
answer can be ventured.

Appendix: The Data

Section

/

II

Prices: WPI's are taken from International Financial Statistics (IFS), line

63. CPI's come from IFS, line 64.
Interest Rates: One- and three-month Eurocurrency deposit rates come from
Data Resources, Inc. (for the U.K., Germany, and Switzerland) and from the
Harris Bank of Chicago Weekly Review (for Canada and Japan), Three-month
domestic money-market rates come from Morgan Guaranty's World Financial

Markets, and are quoted at or near the end of the month. For the U.S., the
rate on prime industrial paper is used. Interbank deposit rates are used for

the U.K., Germany, and Switzerland. For Canada, the rate used is that on
prime finance company paper. The interest rate on three-month repurchase
agreements is used as the Japanese money-market rate.
Section III

Spot and ninety-day forward exchange rates are noon rates collected by the

Federal Reserve System. Spot rates are matched to the maturity of the corresponding forward contract, as described by Riehl and Rodriguez (1977).
Morgan Guranty's World Calendar of Holidays is used to account for bank holidays, weekends, etc.

1. Examples include Bilson (1979), Frankel (1979a), Frenkel (1976), Hodrick
(1978), and Hooper and Morton (1982).

2. In these circumstances, monetary policy also loses its power to systematically influence the terms of trade or real exchange rate, and a second

avenue of demand management is thus closed. Even so, monetary policy can
be effective if nominal wages are sticky (see Obstfeld (1982a)).

But this

possibility disappears as well when wages are fully and instantaneously

indexed

to the aggregate price level, While monetary policy may be

inef-

fective, tax policy can always succeed in driving a wedge between home and
foreign ex ante real rates. The discussion below abstracts from taxes.

Also ignored is the

possibility that changes in monetary growth rates might

influence the terms of trade through real effects of the Tobin-Sidrauski
sort.

3. If there are no default risks, covered interest arbitrage is riskiess
(in

home currency terms) and so covered interest parity must always hold

exactly in the absence of transaction costs. In contrast,

uncovered

arbitrage involves home-currency risk in an essential way. The relation
between

below.

covered and uncovered interest parity is discussed in Section III,

4. This test is suggested by Hodrick (1979). However, he uses the k—period

forward premium rather than the k-period nominal interest differential on the
right-hand

side of (8). The two procedures should yield very similar results

when Eurocurrency interest rates are being compared (see Section III).

5. The reasoi is that the latter uses more information As noted in the next
paragraph of the text, OLS is a special "just-identified" case of this type

of instrumental-variables estimator.

6. When the forecast horizon k exceeds one period, e+k is serially correlated
and, under the null hypothesis, has the covariance matrix of a moving average (MA)
process. As Hansen and Hodrick (1980) note, two-step serial correlation corrections
of the generalized least squares type are inconsistent, even though OLS is consi5-

tent. The inconsistency is due to the fact that the nominal interest differential is not a strictly exogenous variable. To see this, suppose that k =
month3, so that the hypothesis involves three-month interest rates observed

Now e+3 has the

e+3 =

But even though e3 is uncorrelated with

the regressors in (8), t+3 need not be; and therefore application of a
generalized-least-squares transformation to (8) will generally induce a

nonzero correlation between the filtered disturbance t+3 and the filtered
regressors. For a more detailed argument, see Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld
(1982). Hansen and Hodrick (1980) use the Wold theorem to provide a similar
characterization of the form of the forward exchange rate forecast error when
contract periods overlap in the data.

7. See Dhrymes (1974), pp. 183-4. A more recent discussion of the failure
of assumption (10) in regression models with i.n.i.d. residuals appears in

White (1980). For time series models, see Engle (1982) and Hansen (1982).
It is important to note that even if (10) does not hold, the estimator

given in (11) still yields consistent (but relatively inefficient) estimates
of parameters.

8. The condition would also be valid if the instruments and disturbances
were jointly normally distributed. Without the joint normality assumption,
however, lack of correlation need not imply statistical independence.

9. One can of course obtain more efficient covariance matrix estimates by imposing such information if it is known. Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1982)
describe one way of doing this. Their method is implemented in obtaining the

empirical results reported in this paper. White (1980) has proposed a

29

heteroskedastiCitY-consisteflt covariaflCe matrix estimator in a crosSSeCt10flal

context, along with a test of homoskedasticitY. White's test is discussed
further below.

conditional heteroskedaSticitY does not contra-

dict the assumption that e+k follows a covariance_StationarY process. The
latter assumption requires only that the unconditional variance of ek be
constant over time.

11. In order to distinguish empirically

between inflation risk and default

risk, studies of U.S. real interest rates focus on U.S. treasury bills, which
yield a riskless nominal retiirn (Fama 1975, Mishkin 1981, Shiller 1980). As

Mishkin (1982) observes, cross-country comparisons

of real interest rates are

most informative when the bonds being compared have the same default and po-

litical risk characteristics. This is true of Eurocurrency deposits denominated
countries'
in different currencies, but not of onshore bonds traded in different/financial

centers. Thus, tests of real rate equality using domestic money-market interest
rates should be interpreted with caution.

Another cause for caution is the

in
fact that the prices entering CPIs and WPIs are not all sampled every month

revising the previous month's index;

a year (see Fama(1977), Nelson

indeed some prices are observed only once

and Schwert (1977), and Shiller (1980)).

This

means that over short periods, changes in the price indices correspond only
imperfectly to actual price-level

movements. Because the implied measurement

errors are serially correlated, our tests of real interest rate equality are,

30

to some extent, biased. It would be of considerable interest to perform these
tests on twleve-nionth interest and inflation rates.

12. The instrumental variables in these regressions were the time-t nominal
interest differentials for all countries in the sample and the tirne—t nominal

interest differentials squared. All data are described in the appendix.

13. The instrumental variables in the regressions were the time-t nominal
interest differentials for all countries in the sample.

14. Further, any political risks attaching

to EurocurreflcY deposits are not

denomination-Specific, and thus should not influence ex ante real interest
differentials in the Eurocurrency market (cf. footnote 11, above).

15. Fama (1975) uses the CPI inflation rate in his study of the predictive
power of U.S. short-term interest rates.

16. Similar tests have been conducted by Frenkel (1976) (for the German
experience of the 1920s), Frankel (1980), and Stockman (1978). Levich (1978,
1979) surveys the early literature in this area.

17. Hansen and Hodrick (1980) make this assumption

explicitly. In a later

paper, Hansen and Hodrick (1983) allow for conditional heteroskedaSticity in
testing a forward foreign exchange pricing model. Hsieh (1982) accounts for
conditional heteroskedasticity in his tests, and obtains results similar to
those reported in Table S below.
