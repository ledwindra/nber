    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine the payoff performance, up to the end of 2013, of non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), issued up to 2008. We have created a new and detailed data set on the universe of non-agency residential mortgage backed securities, per carefully assembling source data from Bloomberg and other sources.  We compare these payoffs to their ex-ante ratings as well as other characteristics.  We establish seven facts.  First, the bulk of these securities was rated AAA.  Second, AAA securities did ok: on average, their total cumulated losses up to 2013 are 2.3 percent. Third, the subprime AAA-rated segment did particularly well.   Fourth, later vintages did worse than earlier vintages, except for subprime AAA securities. Fifth, the bulk of the losses were concentrated on a small share of all securities.  Sixth, the misrating for AAA securities was modest.  Seventh, controlling for a home price bust, a home price boom was good for the repayment on these securities.  Together, these facts provide challenge  the conventional narrative, that improper ratings of RMBS were a major factor in the financial crisis of 2008.\n\n",
