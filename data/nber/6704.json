We argue that two key model ingredients are essential to address this question: a general equilibrium setup and deviations from purchasing power parity.  By developing a simple benchmark monetary model that contains these two ingredients, we find the following main results.  First, the level of trade is not necessarily higher under a fixed exchange rate regime.  Second, the level of net capital flows tends to be higher under a fixed exchange rate regime when there is a preference for domestic bonds, which is the case when the rate of relative risk-aversion is larger than one.  Third, the asset market structure, including the presence of a forward market, does not quantitatively affect the results.\n\n",
