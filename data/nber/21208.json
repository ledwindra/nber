    "abstract": "\n\nThe expansion of access to publicly provided pre-kindergarten bundles together redistribution to the poor with an early human capital investment.  Financing publicly provided pre-K investment is mainly a state and local issue.  Which voters favor local pre-K expansion?  This paper uses several new data sets to describe the circumstances such that local voters reveal a willingness to spend on an early intervention that may not yield direct benefits for them.    Republican voters consistently oppose the expansion of publicly provided pre-K.  Suburban voters also tend to oppose such investment.  We explore several possible explanations for these facts.\n\n",
