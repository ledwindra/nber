    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper introduces a newly digitized, open-access version of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201cOrange Book\u201d\u2014a linkage between approved small-molecule drugs and the patents that protect them. The Orange Book also reports any applicable regulatory exclusivity that prevents competitive entry. We summarize the Orange Book\u2019s coverage and discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with using these data for research. Empirical validations against various administrative datasets suggest that Orange Book records are, largely, complete and accurate. We conclude with a specific use case\u2014calculating legal exclusivity periods for drugs\u2014to highlight the types of choices that researchers must make when using this resource.\n\n",
