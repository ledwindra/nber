    "abstract": "\n\nFull automation using Artificial Intelligence (AI) predictions may not be optimal if humans can access contextual information. We study human-AI collaboration using an information experiment with professional radiologists. Results show that providing (i) AI predictions does not always improve performance, whereas (ii) contextual information does. Radiologists do not realize the gains from AI assistance because of errors in belief updating \u2013 they underweight AI predictions and treat their own information and AI predictions as statistically independent. Unless these mistakes can be corrected, the optimal human-AI collaboration design delegates cases either to humans or to AI, but rarely to AI assisted humans.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nWe are grateful to Stanford University Hospital for facilitating data access. The authors acknowledge support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation (2022-17182), JPAL Healthcare Delivery Initiative, and MIT SHASS. The experiment was pre-registered on the AEA registry, number AEARCTR-0009620. The preanalysis plans are available at SSR Registration 9620 and SSR registration 8799. The project benefitted from collaboration with several radiologists, including Drs. Matthew Lungren, Curtis Langlotz, and Anuj Pareek of Stanford, Drs. Etan Dayan and Adam Jacobi of Mt. Sinai Hospital, Steven Truong of VinBrain and several radiologists at VINMEC, and teleradiologists at USARAD, Vesta Teleradiology, and Advanced Telemed.
