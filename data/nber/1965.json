    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper investigates the dynamics of firm growth in the U. S.\nmanufacturing sector in the recent past. I use panel data on the\npublicly traded firms in the U. S. manufacturing sector: from a\nuniverse of approximately 1800 firms in 1976, I am able to follow most\nof them for at least three years, and over half of them from 1972 until\n1983. I consider several problems, both econometric and substantive,\nwhich exist in analyzing this kind of data: the choice of size measure,\nthe role of measurement error, and the effect of selection (attrition)\non estimates obtained from this sample.\nUsing time series methods, suitably modified for panel data (where\nthe number of time periods per observational unit is small), I analyze\nthe behavior of employment over time and find that most of the change in\nemployment in any given year is permanent in the sense that there is no\ntendency to return to the previous level. Year-to-year growth rates are\nlargely uncorrelated and there is almost no role for measurement error.\nI find that Gibrat's Law is weakly rejected for the smaller firms in my\nsample and accepted for the larger firms; Other measures of size\nproduce essentially the same results.\nCorrection for attrition from the sample changes the results\nsomewhat: I use a simple model in which firms leave the sample because\nthey are small and/or undervalued (since many exits are acquisitions)\nand find that Tobin's Q, the raio of market valuation to the value of\nthe underlying assets of the firm, is a much better predictor of exit\nprobability than size alone (firms with low Q are more likely to exit\nthe sample). When I use this estimate of the probability of exit to\ncontrol for selection bias, Gibrat's Law is weakly rejected for firms of\nall sizes and there are significant positive effects on firm growth from\nboth investment in physical capital and R&D expenditures, with R&D\nhaving a somewhat higher net effect.\n\n",
