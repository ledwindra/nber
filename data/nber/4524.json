    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper considers a representative agent model of asset prices based on a recursive utility specification.  A constant elasticity of intertemporal substitution is assumed but the risk-preference component of utility is restricted only by qualitative, nonparametric regularity conditions.  The principal contribution is to determine the exhaustive implications of this semiparametric recursive utility model for the one-step ahead joint probability distribution for consumption growth and asset returns.\n\n",
