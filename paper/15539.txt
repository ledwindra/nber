Estimation of Treatment Effects Without an Exclusion Restriction: with an Application to
the Analysis of the School Breakfast Program

ABSTRACT
While the rise in childhood obesity is clear, the policy ramifications are not. School nutrition programs
such as the School Breakfast Program (SBP) have come under much scrutiny. However, the lack of
experimental evidence, combined with non-random selection into these programs, makes identification
of the causal effects of such programs difficult. In the case of the SBP, this difficulty is exacerbated
by the apparent lack of exclusion restrictions. Here, we compare via Monte Carlo study several existing
estimators that do not rely on exclusion restrictions for identification. In addition, we propose two
new estimation strategies. Simulations illustrate the usefulness of our new estimators, as well as provide
applied researchers several practical guidelines when analyzing the causal effects of binary treatments.
More importantly, we find consistent evidence of a beneficial causal effect of SBP participation on
childhood obesity when applying estimators designed to circumvent selection on unobservables.

Introduction

Empirical researchers in economics and other disciplines are often interested in the causal e¤ect of a binary
treatment on an outcome of interest. In many cases, randomization can be used to ensure comparability
(at least in expectation) across the treatment and control groups. However, when a random experiment is
not feasible – either due to ethical considerations or cost – researchers must rely on non-experimental or
observational data. With such data, non-random selection of subjects into the treatment group becomes a
paramount concern.
The econometric literature on program evaluation has witnessed profound growth over the past few
decades in terms of estimation techniques useful in situations where subjects self-select into the treatment
group on the basis of attributes observed by the researcher.1 However, when subjects self-select into the
treatment group on the basis of attributes unobserved to the researcher, but correlated with the outcome
of interest, the situation becomes more di¢ cult for the researcher.
The typical strategy in such circumstances is to rely on an instrumental variable (IV) to identify the
causal e¤ect of the treatment. However, a valid instrument is often unavailable. Moreover, even if one
is available, it may identify an economically uninteresting parameter in the presence of heterogeneous
treatment e¤ects.
This is the situation we confront in this paper. Here, we are interested in identifying the causal e¤ect
of participation in the School Breakfast Program (SBP) on childhood obesity. However, as discussed
below, we believe that students in the treatment and control groups di¤er along important observable and
unobservable dimensions. Moreover, we do not believe we have access to a strong, credible instrument.
As a result, the usual approach for dealing with non-random selection into SBP – IV using an excluded
instrument –does not seem viable.
To proceed, we utilize two existing estimators that do not rely on an exclusion restriction for identi…cation: Heckman’s bivariate normal selection estimator that relies on functional form assumptions for
identi…cation and a recent IV estimator proposed by Klein and Vella (2009) that exploits heteroskedasticity
for identi…cation. In addition, we also propose two new estimators for the analysis of binary treatments
where selection into a treatment is non-random, but one lacks an excludable instrument. The …rst estimator entails minimizing the bias when estimating the e¤ect of a treatment using an estimator that
requires conditional independence – independence between treatment assignment and potential outcomes
conditional on observables –for unbiasdedness. While minimizing the bias still produces a biased estimate
of the causal e¤ect of the treatment, our second estimator is a bias-corrected version of the …rst estimator.

Before applying these methods to the analysis of the causal e¤ect of SBP participation on child health,
we …rst conduct a fairly extensive Monte Carlo study of the estimators considered. This is useful not only
in the present context, but also yields several recommendations for practitioners interested in applying
these methods to the evaluation of other treatments.
Our Monte Carlo results yield several striking …ndings. First and foremost, researchers ought to be
skeptical of estimates obtained using methods identi…ed from functional form assumptions unless the correct
functional form is known. Second, when the appropriate functional form is under-speci…ed in that relevant
regressors are omitted from the model, our minimum-biased estimator improves upon the performance of
commonly used estimators that require conditional independence, as well as those relying on functional
form or heteroskedasticity for identi…cation. Third, when the appropriate functional form is known (or is
over-speci…ed in that irrelevant regressors are included in the model), our bias-corrected estimator does
quite well, even outperforming estimators relying purely on functional form for identi…cation in some
situations. Finally, the Klein and Vella (2009) estimator exploiting heteroskedasticity performs very well
when the error in the treatment equation is in fact heteroskedastic, but less well if this is not the case.
The Klein and Vella (2009) estimator is also more sensitive to over-specifying the model, whereas our
bias-corrected estimator performs better when the model is over-speci…ed.
In terms of the application, our new estimators prove to be a nice complement to existing methods
when conditional independence fails, but one lacks an exclusion restriction. Speci…cally, we …nd a positive
and statistically signi…cant association between SBP and child weight when using estimators that require
conditional independence. The relationship remains positive, but becomes statistically insigni…cant, when
we use our minimum-biased estimator. Finally, consistent with prior suggestive evidence in the literature,
we …nd a negative and sometimes statistically signi…cant causal e¤ect of SBP participation on child weight
using the bivariate normal selection model and Klein and Vella’s (2009) estimator, as well as our biascorrected estimator. This pattern of point estimates highlights the importance of the SBP in the battle
against childhood obesity.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follow. Section 2 provides a brief discussion of childhood
obesity in the U.S., as well as the relevant literature on school meal programs. Section 3 begins by
providing a quick overview of the potential outcomes and corresponding treatment e¤ects framework.
Next, it contains our analysis of the bias of estimators that require conditional independence. Finally,
we present our new estimation methods, as well as the discuss the existing BVN and KV estimators, in
Section 3. Section 4 presents the Monte Carlo study. Section 5 contains our analysis of the SBP. Section
6 concludes.

Background

As is quite evident from recent media reports, childhood obesity is deemed to have reached epidemic status
(Rosin 2008). Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) covering
1976–1980 and 2003–2006 indicate that the prevalence of overweight preschool-aged children, aged 2-5
years, increased from 5.0% to 12.4%.2 Among school-aged children, the prevalence has risen from 6.5% to
17.0% for those aged 6-11; 5.0% to 17.6% for those aged 12-19 years.3
This rise has enormous, long-run implications given that roughly one-third of overweight preschool-aged
children and one-half of overweight school-aged children become obese adults (Serdula et al. 1993). In
turn, adult obesity is associated with numerous health and socio-economic problems (Bleich et al. 2007).
Trasande et al. (2009) estimate that childhood obesity resulted in $237.6 million in hospitalization costs
alone in 2005, up (in real terms) from $125.9 million in 2001. Finkelstein et al. (2009) estimate that the
total medical costs from obesity –adults and children –exceeded $100 billion in 2006 and could have been
as high as $147 billion in 2008.
Given this backdrop, policymakers in the US have acted in a number of di¤erent directions, particularly
within schools. These reforms culminated in November 2007 as the US Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) launched the Childhood Overweight and Obesity Prevention Initiative. In addition to these
recent policy developments, two long-standing federal programs a¤ecting roughly 30 million students on
a typical school day have come under scrutiny: the School Breakfast Program (SBP) and the National
School Lunch Program (NSLP).
The existing literature analyzing these programs – either in combination or in isolation – relies on
non-experimental data where the potential exists for non-random selection into treatment on the basis of
student-speci…c unobservable attributes. Three noteworthy approaches have been employed in an attempt
to circumvent this issue. First, Bhattacharya et al. (2006) employ a di¤erence-in-di¤erence (DD) strategy
and compare the weight and nutritional intake of children during the summer to that during the school
year across schools that do and do not o¤er breakfast. The authors …nd evidence that children do fare
better during the school year along certain dimensions. Second, Schanzenbach (2008) utilizes a regression
discontinuity (RD) approach that exploits the sharp income cut-o¤ for eligibility for reduced-price meals
to assess the impact of the NSLP. She …nds that NSLP participation increases the probability of being
obese due to the additional calories provided by school lunches. Finally, Millimet et al. (2009; hereafter
MTH) apply the methodology developed in Altonji et al. (2005) to assess the sensitivity of the e¤ects of
2
Overweight is de…ned as an age- and gender-speci…c body mass index (BMI) greater than the 95th percentile based on
growth charts from the Center for Disease Control (CDC).

participation in the SBP and NSLP estimated under exogeneity to deviations from this assumption. The
authors …nd strong, albeit suggestive, evidence that the SBP is bene…cial for children, whereas the NSLP
is harmful.
Although informative, each of these approaches has limitations. The DD strategy assumes that schools
do not decide to participate in the SBP on the basis of the weight trajectories of its students, and that
children self-selecting into schools that participate in the SBP do not have di¤erent trends in weight and
nutrition relative to students attending schools not o¤ering breakfast. In addition, the treatment is schoollevel breakfast availability, not student-level SBP participation. The RD approach potentially confounds
the e¤ects of participation in the SBP and NSLP since the same eligibility criteria is used for both programs.
Moreover, the RD approach estimates the local average treatment e¤ect (LATE) when the treatment e¤ect
is heterogenous.4 Finally, the Altonji et al. (2005) approach is merely suggestive, and fails to provide point
estimates of the causal e¤ects of the programs except under functional form assumptions.
In this study, we assess the causal role of the SBP in the child obesity epidemic, as well as propose
new techniques applicable more generally to the evaluation of binary treatments. We focus on the SBP
for two reasons. First, MTH and Schanzenbach (2008) both …nd little evidence that NSLP participation
is non-random conditional on observables. Second, MTH …nds evidence of positive selection into the SBP:
children with steeper weight trajectories over time are more likely to participate conditional on observables.
Moreover, addressing non-random selection into the SBP is vital not only for obtaining consistent estimates
of the causal e¤ect of SBP participation, but also for estimating the causal e¤ect of NSLP participation.5
MTH conclude that if there is positive selection into SBP participation on child weight, then the SBP
lowers child weight and the NSLP raises child weight once this non-random selection is addressed. Because
the underlying selection into SBP is crucial for consistently estimating the causal e¤ects of both programs,
and the analysis in MTH is only suggestive of a bene…cial impact of SBP participation once selection is
addressed, obtaining point estimates of the causal e¤ect of SBP participation utilizing di¤erent techniques
is of critical importance to policymakers.
4

See Lee and Lemieux (2009) for a detailed discussion.
This is true despite MTH concluding that there is no selection into NSLP on the basis of student-level unobservables.
The reason is that if SBP is erroneously treated as exogenous, then the bias due to correlation with the error term spills over
and also biases the coe¢ cient on NSLP participation since SBP and NSLP participation are highly correlated.

The Evaluation Problem

3.1

Setup

Consider a random sample of N individuals from a large population indexed by i = 1; :::; N . Utilizing
the potential outcomes framework (see, e.g., Neyman 1923; Fisher 1935; Roy 1951; Rubin 1974), let Yi (T )
denote the potential outcome of individual i under treatment T , T 2 T . Here, we consider only the case of
binary treatments: T = f0; 1g. The causal e¤ect of the treatment (T = 1) relative to the control (T = 0)
is de…ned as the di¤erence between the corresponding potential outcomes. Formally,

i

= Yi (1)

Yi (0):

In the evaluation literature, several population parameters are of potential interest. The most commonly
used include the ATE, the ATT, and the ATU. These are de…ned as

AT E

= E[ i ] = E[Yi (1)

Yi (0)]

(1)

AT T

= E[ i jT = 1] = E[Yi (1)

Yi (0)jT = 1]

(2)

AT U

= E[ i jT = 0] = E[Yi (1)

Yi (0)jT = 0]:

(3)

In general, the parameters in (1) –(3) may vary with a vector covariates, X. As a result, each of the
parameters may be de…ned conditional on a particular value of X as follows:
AT E [X]

= E[ i jX] = E[Yi (1)

Yi (0)jX]

(4)

AT T [X]

= E[ i jX; T = 1] = E[Yi (1)

Yi (0)jX; T = 1]

(5)

AT U [X]

= E[ i jX; T = 0] = E[Yi (1)

Yi (0)jX; T = 0]:

(6)

The parameters in (1) –(3) are obtained by taking the expectation of the corresponding parameter in (4)
– (6) over the distribution of X in the relevant population (the unconditional distribution of X for the
ATE, and distribution of X condition on T = 1 and T = 0 for the ATT and ATU, respectively).
For each individual, we observe the triple fYi ; Ti ; Xi g, where Yi is the observed outcome, Ti is a binary
indicator of the treatment received, and Xi is a vector of covariates. The only requirement of the covariates
included in Xi is that they are pre-determined (that is, they are una¤ected by Ti ) and do not perfectly
predict treatment assignment. The relationship between the potential and observed outcomes is given by
Yi = Ti Yi (1) + (1
5

Ti )Yi (0)

which makes clear that only one potential outcome is observed for any individual. As such, estimating
is not trivial as there is an inherent missing data problem.
The methods utilized by researchers to circumvent this missing data problem are classi…ed into two
groups: selection on observables estimators and selection on unobservable estimators. The distinction lies
in whether a method consistently estimates the causal e¤ect of the treatment in the presence of unobservable attributes of subjects that are correlated with both treatment assignment and the outcome of interest
conditional on the set of observable variables. Assuming a lack of such unobservables is referred to as conditional independence or unconfoundedness assumption (Rubin 1974; Heckman and Robb 1985). Formally,
under the conditional independence assumption (CIA), treatment assignment is said to be independent of
potential outcomes conditional on the set of covariates, X. As a result, selection into treatment is random
conditional on X and the average e¤ect of the treatment can be obtained by comparing outcomes of individuals in di¤erent treatment states with identical values of the covariates. To solve the dimensionality
problem that is likely to arise if X is a lengthy vector, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) propose using the
propensity score, P (Xi ) = Pr(Ti = 1jXi ), instead of X as the conditioning variable.
If CIA fails to hold, then consistent estimation of the causal e¤ect requires a selection on unobservables
estimation technique. The di¢ culty for applied researchers confronting such a scenario is that obtaining
a consistent point estimate of a measure of the treatment e¤ect typically requires an exclusion restriction
(i.e., an observable variable that impacts treatment assignment, but not the outcome of interest conditional
on treatment assignment).
Unfortunately, in many situations, valid exclusion restrictions, as usually conceived, are not available.
At that point, researchers have limited options: (i) abandon point estimation, instead focusing on bounding
a measure of the treatment e¤ect, (ii) rely on strong functional form assumptions for identi…cation, or (iii)
identify the causal e¤ect from higher moments of the observed variables or heteroskedasticity. Here, we
propose two new options in addition to applying previous estimators utilizing functional form assumptions
and heteroskedasticity for identi…cation. First, we present a minimum-biased estimator. This approach
entails the utilization of a selection on observables estimator, but restricts the estimation sample in such
a way so as to minimize the bias arising from the failure of CIA. Second, we extend our minimum-biased
estimation approach by suggesting a bias-corrected version of this estimator.
To proceed, we …rst derive the bias of estimators that require CIA when, in fact, this assumption
fails under certain assumptions (namely, joint normality). We then derive our minimum-biased and biascorrected estimators under these same assumptions. Finally, we extend our estimators to the case where
joint normality does not hold.

3.2

Bias When CIA Fails

Given knowledge of the propensity score, or an estimate thereof, and su¢ cient overlap between the distributions of the propensity score across the T = 1 and T = 0 groups (typically referred to as the common
support condition; see Dehejia and Wahba (1999) or Smith and Todd (2005)), the parameters discussed
above can be estimated in a number of ways under CIA.6 Regardless of which such technique is employed,
each will be biased if CIA fails to hold.
Black and Smith (2004) and Heckman and Navarro-Lozano (2004) consider the bias when estimating
the ATT under CIA and the assumption is incorrect. The bias of the ATT at some value of the propensity
score, P (X), is given by
BAT T [P (X)] = bAT T [P (X)]

AT T [P (X)]

= fE[Y (1)jT = 1; P (X)]

E[Y (0)jT = 0; P (X)]g

fE[Y (1)jT = 1; P (X)]
= E[Y (0)jT = 1; P (X)]

E[Y (0)jT = 1; P (X)]g

E[Y (0)jT = 0; P (X)]

(7)

where bAT T refers to some propensity score based estimator of the ATT requiring CIA (e.g., propensity
score matching or inverse propensity score weighting).

To better understand the behavior of the bias, Black and Smith (2004) and Heckman and NavarroLozano (2004) make the following two assumptions:
(A1) Potential outcomes and latent treatment assignment are additively separable in observables and
unobservables

where ( ) and

(8)

( ) are the standard normal density and cumulative density function, respectively.

As noted in Black and Smith (2004), BAT T [P (X)] is minimized when h(X) = 0, which implies that
P (X) = 0:5. Thus, the authors recommend that researchers estimate

AT T

using the ‘thick support’

region of the propensity score (e.g., P (X) 2 (0:33; 0:67)).
Prior to continuing, it is important to note that if the ATT varies with X (and, hence, P (X)), then
using only observations on the thick support estimates a di¤erent parameter than the population ATT
given in (2). Indeed, the procedure suggested in Black and Smith (2004) accomplishes the following. It
searches over the parameters de…ned in (5) to …nd the value of P (X) for which the

AT T [P (X)]

can be

estimated with the least bias. This point is very intriguing. Stated di¤erently, when unconfoundedness
fails,

AT T ,

the population ATT, cannot be estimated in an unbiased manner using estimators that rely

on this assumption. Rather than invoking di¤erent assumptions to identify the population ATT (e.g.,
those utilized by selection on unobservables estimators), the Black and Smith (2004) approach identi…es
the parameter that can be estimated with the smallest bias under unconfoundedness. Whether or not the
parameter being estimated with the least bias, eAT T = E[E[ i jP (X); T = 1]], where the outer expectation

is over Xj0:33 < P (X) < 0:67 and T = 1, is an interesting economic parameter is a di¤erent question. The
key point, however, is that when restricting the estimation sample to observations with propensity scores
contained in a subset of the unit interval, the parameter being estimated will di¤er from the population
ATT unless the treatment e¤ect does not vary with X (i.e., E[ i jP (X); T = 1] = E[ i jT = 1]).
With this point in mind, we now consider the bias for the ATE and the ATU since the ATT is not the
only parameter of interest in applied settings. For the ATU, it is trivial to show that
BAT U [P (X)] = E["1 jT = 1; P (X)] E["1 jT = 0; P (X)]
(h(X))
=
1u 1
(h(X))[1
(h(X))]

8

(9)

which is also minimized when h(X) = 0, or P (X) = 0:5. However, it is useful to note that
BAT U [P (X)] = E[ + "0 jT = 1; P (X)]

E[ + "0 jT = 0; P (X)]

= B AT T [P (X)] + E[ jT = 1; P (X)]
where

= "1

E[ jT = 0; P (X)]

"0 is the unobserved, individual-speci…c gain from treatment. Thus, the magnitude of the

bias of the ATU may either be larger or smaller than the corresponding bias of the ATT. If we add the
following assumption:
(A3) Non-negative selection into the treatment on individual-speci…c, unobserved gains
E[ jT = 1; P (X)] > E[ jT = 0; P (X)]
then jBAT U [P (X)]j > jBAT T [P (X)]j for all P (X).7
Now consider the ATE. Utilizing the fact that

AT E [P (X)]

= P (X)

AT T [P (X)]+[1

P (X)]

AT U [P (X)],

and rewriting Y (1) = g1 (X) + ( + "0 ), the bias for the ATE is given by

which is equivalent to the expression derived in Heckman and Navarro-Lozano (2004).
Equation (10) leads to three salient points. First, under A1 – A3, jBAT U [P (X)]j > jBAT E [P (X)]j >
jBAT T [P (X)]j. Second, the value of P (X) that minimizes the bias of the ATE, referred to as the bias
minimizing propensity score (BMPS) and denoted P (X), is not …xed; rather, it depends on the values of
0u 0
u

and

u

. In particular, the bias of the ATE is minimized when h(X) = 0 only in the case where

= 0 (i.e., no selection on unobserved, individual-speci…c gains to treatment). Third, there are two

special cases for which the bias disappears:
(i) No Selection on Unobservables Impacting Outcomes in the Untreated State: If

Interestingly, when the two types of selection operate in same direction, P (X) > 0:5 implying that the
treatment e¤ect for individuals with a higher probability of receiving the treatment can be estimated with
less bias. However, when these two types of selection go in opposite direction, P (X) > 0:5 when selection
on unobserved gains is relatively large in absolute value. Thus, in this case, when there is relatively strong
selection on unobserved gains, the treatment e¤ect for individuals with a higher probability of receiving
the treatment can be estimated with less bias. Figure 1 provides a complete characterization of P (X).

Estimation
The Minimum-Biased Approach

In light of the preceding discussion, we propose a new estimation approach when unconfoundedness is not
likely to hold, but one lacks a valid exclusion restriction. We couch our technique within the normalized
inverse probability weighted estimator of Hirano and Imbens (2001).8 First, consider estimation of the
ATE. Horvitz and Thompson (1952) show that the ATE may be expressed as

AT E

Other propensity score estimators, such as matching, could be used as well. Millimet and Tchernis (2009) …nd little
practical di¤erence between estimator of Hirano and Imbens (2001) and kernel matching.

10

The estimator in (11) is the unnormalized estimator as the weights do not necessarily sum to unity. To
circumvent this issue, Hirano and Imbens (2001) propose an alternative estimator, referred to as the
normalized or HI estimator, which is given by

Millimet and Tchernis (2009) provide evidence of the superiority of the normalized estimator in practical
settings.
Under CIA, the HI estimator in (12) provides an unbiased estimate of

AT E .

When this assumption

fails, the bias is given (10). Rather than abandon this estimator, however, we propose to alter the estimator
in such a manner so as to minimize the bias. Speci…cally, we suggest estimating (12) using only observations
with a propensity score in a neighborhood around the BMPS, P .9 Formally, we propose the following

Our proposed estimator immediately raises a question: If one is willing to maintain the assumptions
underlying the BVN selection model in (14), why not just use the OLS estimates of (14) to estimate the

perhaps the estimator in (12) or (13) will perform better in practice. Moreover, when one is interested in
the ATT rather than the ATE, our minimum biased approach can be utilized without estimation of (14)
since P is known to be one-half. In this case, our estimator –couched in the HI estimator of the ATT –

The Bias-Corrected Approach

While (13) and (17) provide a minimum-biased estimator of the ATE and ATT, respectively, estimation
of the error correlation structure using (14) immediately gives rise to the possibility of a bias-corrected
version of each estimator. Speci…cally, after estimating (14), estimates of the bias of the minimum-biased

The analysis to this point has relied on the assumption of joint normality; an assumption that may be
unrealistic in many applications. As a result, before turning to our Monte Carlo study, we consider
deviations from the normality assumption. To proceed, we follow Lee (1984) who utilizes the fact that
under certain assumptions the (unknown) joint density of "j and u, fj ("j ; u), j = 0; 1, may be written as
a bivariate Edgeworth series of distributions. Formally,
fj ("j ; u) =

Klein & Vella (2009) Estimator

For comparison to the previous estimators, we also employ the estimator of Klein and Vella (2009; hereafter
KV). Our parametric implementation of this estimator relies on a similar functional form assumption to
the BVN estimator in the absence of heteroskedasticity, but e¤ectively induces valid exclusion restrictions
in the presence of heteroskedasticity. To proceed, suppose that latent treatment assignment is now given
by
T =X

u

where u = S(X)u and u is drawn from a standard normal density. In this case, the probability of receiving
the treatment conditional on X is given by
Pr(T = 1jX) =

X
S(X)

:

(26)

Assuming S(X) = exp(X ), the parameters of (26) are estimable by maximum likelihood (ML), with the
log-likelihood function given by

ln L =
where the element of

X

X
exp(X )

Ti

ln 1

(27)

corresponding to the intercept is normalized to zero for identi…cation.

\
The ML estimates are then used to obtain the predicted probability of treatment, P
(X), which may
be used as an instrument for T in equation (14) excluding the selection correction terms.11 Note, even if
11

\
Interactions between P
(X) and X may also serve as instruments given inclusion of interactions between T and X in (14).

15

\
S(X) = 1, P
(X) remains a valid instrument since it is non-linear in X. However, since the non-linearity
arises mostly in the tails, identi…cation typically relies on a small fraction of the sample. On the other
hand, if S(X) 6= 1, then the KV approach e¤ectively induces a valid exclusion restriction as Z

X=S(X)

is frequently linearly independent of X (Klein and Vella 2009).

Monte Carlo Study

5.1

Setup

To assess the performance of the various estimators, we use two primary experimental designs. In the …rst
design, the data-generating process (DGP) imposes the constant treatment e¤ect setup (i.e.,

i

=

for all

i). In the second design, the DGP gives rise to heterogeneous treatment e¤ects, where the heterogeneity is
due to unobserved, individual-speci…c gains to treatment (i.e.,
due to di¤erences in "1i

i

varies across i, but this variation arises

"0i ). In this study, in part motivated by our application, we do not consider

the case where the treatment e¤ect is heterogeneous on the basis of observables; the vectors

0

and

1

are

identical except for the intercept.
We assess …nite sample performance by simulating 250 data sets, each with 5,000 observations, containing

In the constant treatment e¤ect setup, there is a common e¤ect " = "0 = "1 and potential outcomes

Y (0) = g0 (X) + "0 =

h(X) + "

Y (1) = g1 (X) + "0 = 1 + h(X) + "

We also simulated 50 data sets with 250,000 observations each to assess large sample performance. Results are available

In the heterogeneous e¤ect

In the second error structure, the errors are drawn from an

asymmetric and non-normal multivariate distribution with the desired correlation matrix using the method
in Headrick and Sawilowsky (1999). Speci…cally, "0 and "1 are mean zero with unit variance and skewness
p
and kurtosis close to a 21 distribution (skewness is roughly 8 and kurtosis is around 15); u continues to
have a standard normal distribution. The third and fourth error structures are identical to the preceding
cases except we introduce heteroskedasticity in the treatment assignment equation. Speci…cally, we de…ne
u = (1 + 0:45(x1 + x2 ))u and T = 0:5 + h(X)

u .

In the constant treatment e¤ect experimental design, we consider three cases:
and -0.50, where CIA holds in the …rst case and larger values of

0u

0u

equal to zero, -0.25,

(in absolute value) correspond to greater

selection on unobservables.13 In the heterogeneous treatment e¤ect experimental design, we consider three
cases:

0:10, and
0u

0u

0:40 and

u

=

0:10, where CIA

(in absolute value) correspond to greater selection on

unobservables.
Finally, for each DGP considered, we use four speci…cations when implementing the various estimators.
13
Given the DGP for T , 0u < 0 indicates positive selection (i.e., unobservables associated with better outcomes are also
associated with a higher probability of receiving the treatment).

The speci…cations di¤er in terms of the functional form of the treatment assignment model, as well as the
outcome equations in (14) and (25). Speci…cation (1) includes only linear terms for x1 and x2 (hence, x21 , x22 ,
and x1 x2 are omitted) in the probit model for treatment assignment and in (14) and (25). Speci…cation (2)
includes x1 , x2 , x21 , x22 , and x1 x2 in the set of covariates used in the probit model for treatment assignment
and in (14) and (25). Speci…cation (3) is identical to Speci…cation (2) but adds cubic terms for x1 and x2
as well as the complete set of interaction terms between the linear and quadratic terms. Speci…cation (4) is
identical to Speci…cation (3) but incorporates an additional, completely irrelevant regressor, x3

U ( 1; 1),

and includes x3 , x23 , x33 , and the full set of interaction terms in the set of covariates. In Speci…cations (1)
–(3), we model S(X) = S(x1 ; x2 ); in speci…cation (4), we model S(X) = S(x1 ; x2 ; x3 ).
Two …nal comments are warranted. First, we assume in all cases that the researcher knows that the
treatment e¤ect does not vary on the basis of observables. As such, we exclude interactions between T and
the set of covariates in X in (14) and (25). Second, Speci…cation (1) is under-speci…ed, Speci…cation (2) is
the correct speci…cation, and Speci…cations (3) and (4) are over-speci…ed. Examination of these di¤erent
cases is motivated by the fact that the applied researcher likely does not know the correct functional
form even if the researcher knows the set of covariates in the model. In addition, Millimet and Tchernis
(2009) …nd that over-specifying the propensity score model when unconfoundedness holds is warranted.
We explore whether this conclusion extends to the current situation.

5.2.1

Results
Correct Speci…cation

Results for the ATE and ATT from the …rst experimental design – constant treatment e¤ect – using the
correct speci…cation, Speci…cation (2), are presented in Table 1. Figures represent Root Mean Squared
Errors (RMSE). Panel I displays the results when the errors are normal; Panel II displays the results when
the errors are asymmetric and non-normal. The left (right) set of columns corresponds to the case where
the error in the treatment assignment is homoskedastic (heteroskedastic). Within each column, the shaded
number represents the smallest RMSE.
Columns (1) and (4) correspond to the simplest case: the treatment e¤ect is constant and conditional
independence holds. Three …ndings emerge. First, consonant with our expectations, the HI estimator
performs best for the ATE with or without homoskedastic errors (Column (1)). However, our MB estimator
with a large radius ( = 0:25) fares only marginally worse than HI. Second, the HI estimator and MB
estimator with a large radius ( = 0:25) achieve almost identical performance for the ATT when errors are
homoskedastic; our MB estimator with a large radius ( = 0:25) performs marginally worse than HI with

18

heteroskedastic errors (Column (4)). Third, even when normality holds, KV, BVN, and MB-BC have a
higher RMSE than HI and MB for both the ATE and ATT. This is not surprising given the e¢ ciency loss
from not utilizing conditional independence when this holds in the DGP. Finally, BVN, MB, and MB-BC
outperform their counterparts allowing for non-normality even when the errors are non-normal. Thus, the
‡exibility o¤ered by these estimators is more than o¤set by the imprecision resulting from the increased
parameterization of the model.
Columns (2), (3), (5), and (6) introduce selection on unobservables into the DGP, with (3) and (6)
containing the largest amount of selection on unobservables. For the ATE (Columns (2) and (3)), three
salient conclusions emerge. First, with relatively modest selection on unobservables (Column (2)), KV,
BVN, and MB-BC with a large radius ( = 0:25) perform comparably, with KV doing marginally worse
than the other two estimators when errors are homoskedastic. Second, with relatively strong selection
on unobservables (Column (3)), KV performs slightly better than BVN and MB-BC with a large radius
( = 0:25) except in the case of normal and homoskedastic errors where BVN and MB-BC have lower
RMSEs. Finally, as in the case of selection on observables, BVN and MB-BC outperform their counterparts
allowing for non-normality even when the errors are non-normal.
When there is selection on unobservables and one is interested in the ATT (Columns (5) and (6)), the
conclusions are only slightly altered. First, with relatively modest selection on unobservables (Column
(5)), KV, BVN, and MB-BC with a large radius ( = 0:25) continue to have similar RMSEs with BVN
doing marginally better than the other two estimators except in the case of non-normal and heteroskedastic
errors. Second, with relatively strong selection on unobservables (Column (6)), KV, BVN, and MB-BC
with a large radius ( = 0:25) perform comparably when errors are normal; KV performs signi…cantly
better than the other two estimators when errors are non-normal. This result holds regardless of whether
the errors are homoskedastic or not. Finally, as in the prior cases, BVN and MB-BC outperform their
counterparts allowing for non-normality even when normality does not hold.
Next, we turn to the results for the ATE and ATT from the second experimental design. Recall, with
this DGP, the treatment e¤ect varies across observations due to individual-speci…c, unobserved gains to
treatment. Results obtained using the correct speci…cation, Speci…cation (2), are presented in Table 2.
Columns (1) and (4) again correspond to the case of selection on observables. The qualitative …ndings
are unchanged from the corresponding columns in Table 1. Speci…cally, HI continues to perform best for
both ATE and ATT, but MB with a large radius ( = 0:25) has only a marginally higher RMSE. Similarly,
the majority of the …ndings from Table 1 continue to hold when focusing on the ATE and ATT under
selection on unobservables (Columns (2), (3), (5), and (6)). The only noteworthy change is that now BVN
outperforms KV in the case of non-normal and homoskedastic errors with relatively strong selection on
19

unobservables for the ATE (Column (3)).14
Taking a step back, three conclusions emerge that should be of interest to applied researchers. First,
under selection on observables, HI is preferred, but MB with a large radius is very comparable even in small
samples. Moreover, MB is more robust to selection on unobservables than HI when the focus is on the ATE.
Thus, MB provides researchers with an alternative estimator that can serve as a useful robustness check to
the usual HI estimator when the selection on observables assumption is questionable, but the parameter
of interest is the ATE. Second, if the researcher is con…dent there is selection on unobservables, then
KV, BVN, and MB-BC with a large radius are the preferred estimators. In particular, BVN is preferred
when errors are homoskedastic, unless the focus is on the ATT and there is relatively strong selection on
unobservables in which case MB-BC is preferred. KV is preferred when errors are heteroskedastic. As
stated earlier, since the MB and MB-BC estimators rely on the BVN estimator, it might seem odd not to
simply use the BVN estimator. However, as the simulations indicate, there are multiple scenarios in which
the MB or MB-BC estimator outperform the BVN (and KV) estimators. Finally, there is little gain in
general from the estimators based on deviations from normality. This arises due to the noise introduced
through the estimation of additional parameters in (25).
5.2.2

Under- and Over-specifying the Model

The preceding results assume that the proper speci…cation for the observables is known. Since this is rarely
true in practice, we now assess the performance of the estimators considered herein when this assumption
is relaxed. The results are relegated to Appendix A.
Tables A1–A3 correspond to the …rst experimental design where the treatment e¤ect is constant across
all observations. Table A1 corresponds to the case of selection on observables, A2 to the case of moderate
selection on unobservables, and A3 to the case of strong selection on unobservables. Within each table,
Columns (1) through (4) correspond to Speci…cations (1) – (4) de…ned previously; thus, Column (1)
is under-speci…ed, Column (2) is correctly speci…ed and simply repeats the results from Table 1, and
Columns (3) and (4) are over-speci…ed. Tables A4–A6 are similarly organized, but correspond to the
second experimental design where the treatment is heterogeneous due to individual-speci…c, unobserved
gains to treatment.
To begin, consider the case of selection on observables when the focus is on the ATE (Table A1 and
A4). Four interesting conclusions can be drawn. First, HI continues have the smallest RMSE when the
14

There are also two instances where MB (Table 2, Panel II, Column (3) with heteroskedastic errors) and MB-EE (Table
2, Panel II, Column (5) with homoskedastic errors) perform best. We do not pay much attention to these cases as these
estimators do not signi…cantly outperform the other estimators in these speci…cations, while they perform particularly poorly
in other speci…cations. Thus, a researcher would be hard-pressed to justify use of these estimators when the exact DGP is
unknown.

20

model is over-…tted. In addition, as demonstrated in Millimet and Tchernis (2009), there is no penalty to
over-…tting, and in many cases the RMSE actually falls. This is also consistent with Hirano et al. (2003)
who …nd that using an estimated propensity score is preferable even when the true propensity score is
known, as well as recent work in Abadie and Imbens (2009) who …nd that the asymptotic variance of
propensity score matching estimators is smaller when the propensity score is estimated (as opposed to
known).
Second, as found in Tables 1 and 2 using the correct speci…cation, MB with a large radius ( = 0:25) is
very comparable in performance to HI and, as with HI, over-…tting improves its performance. Third, if the
model is under-speci…ed, MB-EE with a small radius ( = 0:05) does best when the errors are homoskedastic, whereas MB with a small radius ( = 0:05) does best when the errors are heteroskedastic. Thus, when
the researcher believes that conditional independence holds, but is unsure of the proper functional form,
MB with a small radius provides a viable sensitivity check as it performs signi…cantly better than HI and
MB-EE when errors are heteroskedastic, and only marginally worse than MB-EE (but still much better
than HI) when errors are homoskedastic.
Finally, when the model is under-speci…ed (Column (1)), which induces selection on unobservables, KV,
BVN, BVN-EE, MB-BC, and MB-BC-EE perform very poorly despite their design to circumvent selection
on unobservables. In fact, the RMSE for KV is roughly eight times larger than MB and MB-EE, while
the RMSE for BVN and MB-BC (BVN-EE and MB-BC-EE) is at least 30 (550) times larger. Thus, when
applying these estimators, researchers must be very wary of under-specifying the model.
When selection is still only on observables but one focuses on the ATT, the conclusions drawn change
somewhat. Speci…cally, HI continues to do best when the model is over-…tted, with MB with a large
radius ( = 0:25) performing only marginally worse, and over-…tting bene…ting the performance of both
estimators. In addition, KV, BVN, BVN-EE, MB-BC, and MB-BC-EE continue to perform very poorly
when the model is under-speci…ed. However, if the model is under-speci…ed, now MB with a small radius
( = 0:05) does best when the errors are homoskedastic, whereas MB-EE with a small radius ( = 0:05)
does best when the errors are heteroskedastic. Moreover, when the errors are heteroskedastic and the
model is under-…tted, MB has a higher RMSE than HI. Consequently, when the researcher is focusing on
the ATT and believes that conditional independence holds, but is unsure of the proper functional form,
MB-EE with a small radius is recommended as a sensitivity check as it performs signi…cantly better than
HI and MB when errors are heteroskedastic, and only marginally worse than MB (but still much better
than HI) when errors are homoskedastic.
Finally, consider the case of selection on unobservables (Tables A2, A3, A5, and A6). Upon digesting
the results, two salient patterns emerge. First, as in Tables A1 and A4, when under-…tting the model,
21

MB and MB-EE with a small radius ( = 0:05) perform much better than the remaining estimators in
most cases, with MB doing marginally better for the ATE under heteroskedasticity and the ATT under
homoskedasticity. Second, when using the correct speci…cation or when over-…tting, KV, BVN, and MB-BC
with a large radius ( = 0:25) are comparable overall and generally outperform the remaining estimators.
However, the relative ranking among these three varies depending on the parameter of interest, whether
the errors are normal and/or homoskedastic, and whether the model is correctly speci…ed or over-speci…ed.
For example, with normal errors (Panel I in each of the tables), BVN and MB-BC have similar RMSEs
and outperform KV although the margin is narrower (or eliminated) when the model is correctly speci…ed
and the errors are heteroskedastic; unlike most of the other estimators, the performance of KV is harmed
by over-…tting. This same pattern tends to hold with non-normal errors in Tables A2 and A5 (modest
selection on unobservables). However, in Panel II of Table A3 (constant treatment e¤ect with non-normal
errors), KV tends to do very well, particularly when the errors are heteroskedastic or the focus is on
the ATT. Thus, with relatively strong selection on unobservables and non-normal errors, KV is superior.
In contrast, in Panel II of Table A6 (heterogeneous treatment e¤ect with non-normal errors), BVN does
quite well when the focus is on the ATE (with MB-BC with a large radius ( = 0:25) performing only
marginally worse) or the ATT with homoskedastic errors, whereas KV does best when estimating the ATT
with heteroskedastic errors.
5.2.3

Discussion

In light of the Monte Carlo results, the applied researcher is presented with a new set of tools that should
prove useful in assessing the causal impact of a treatment. If one believes that individuals select into the
treatment on the basis of observables only, but the proper functional form is unknown, then it is best
to use HI and de…nitely err on the side of over-…tting the propensity score model. Moreover, our MB or
MB-EE estimator with a large radius provides a useful robustness check to HI as it performs nearly as
well when the model is correctly speci…ed or over-speci…ed, and better when the propensity score model is
under-specifed.
If one believes that individuals select into the treatment on the basis of unobservables, but the proper
functional form is unknown, then KV, BVN, and MB-BC perform well in general, with KV performing
marginally better (worse) when the error in the treatment equation is heteroskedastic (homoskedastic).
In addition, despite the heavy reliance of the MB-BC estimator on the BVN selection model, there are
multiple instances where MB-BC has a lower RMSE than BVN. Finally, it is again best to err on the
side of over-…tting the model, and there is no advantage gained by using the BVN or MB-BC estimators
allowing for non-normality.

Background

As recognition of the importance of breakfast to overall health, as well as academic achievement, has grown,
so to has the popularity and scrutiny of the SBP. The SBP is a federally funded program, overseen by
the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), but administered by state education agencies. The SBP was
established in 1966 by the Child Nutrition Act, and made permanent in 1975. Participation by schools
– both public and private – is voluntary (unless mandated by the state). In 1970, roughly 0.5 million
students were served on an average school day. This …gure increased to 4.0 million in 1990, 7.5 million in
2000, and 10.5 million in 2008 (8.1 million of which were free or reduced-price meals).15 The program cost
the federal government $2.4 billion in 2008.
If schools do participate, they are reimbursed a …xed amount per breakfast served.16 However, to
qualify for reimbursement, the meals must meet federal nutrition guidelines established in 1995 under the
“School Meals Initiative for Healthy Children” (SMI). This entails no more than 30% of the breakfast’s
calories be derived from fat, and less than 10% from saturated fat. Breakfasts also must provide one-fourth
of the Recommended Dietary Allowance for protein, calcium, iron, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and contain an
age-appropriate level of calories.
Enforcement of the SMI requirements is handled by requiring states to monitor local school food
authorities through reviews conducted at least once every …ve years. In turn, the USDA monitors state
compliance with this review requirement. The USDA has also begun to provide regional and local training
to ensure adequate overview, as well as training in the preparation of healthy meals and dissemination of
information for children related to the importance of a healthy diet.

Data

To analyze the impact of SBP participation on child health, we utilize data from the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). We measure participation in the SBP in
spring …rst grade; we ignore kindergarten participation due to many children attending half-day programs.
Our outcomes of interest are measures of child health in spring third and …fth grade or the change from
fall …rst grade to spring third and …fth grade. As such, we are analyzing more of the long-run relationship
15

Students residing in households with family incomes at or below 130% of the federal poverty line are eligible for free meals,
while those in households with family incomes between 130% and 185% of the federal poverty line are entitled to reduced price
meals. In addition, children from households that receive aid through food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families,
or the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations are automatically eligible for free meals.
16
For the 2009-2010 school year, reimbursement rates are $1.46 per free meal, $1.16 per reduced-price breakfast, and $0.26
per full-priced breakfast. Schools establish their own prices for full price meals, but prices for reduced price meals are capped.

between child health and SBP participation. We utilize three measures of child health:
(i) growth rate in BMI (i.e., change in log BMI) from …rst grade to spring third and …fth grade,
(ii) indicator for overweight status in spring third and …fth grade, and
(iii) indicator for obesity status in spring third and …fth grade,
where we de…ne overweight (obesity) as having a BMI above the (85th ) 95th percentile.17
The following covariates are included in X: child’s race (white, black, Hispanic, and other), age, and
gender, child’s birth weight, household socioeconomic (SES) status, mother’s employment status, mother’s
education, number of children’s books at home, mother’s age at …rst birth, an indicator if the child’s mother
received WIC bene…ts prior to kindergarten, region, city type (urban, suburban, or rural), a measure of
food security, and whether the child eats a school-provided lunch.
Children with missing data for gender and age are dropped from our sample. We also restrict the
sample to public schools. Missing values for the remaining control variables are imputed and imputation
dummies are added to the control set. In addition, we restrict attention to public schools. The …nal sample
contains 9,952 students when analyzing third grade outcomes, of which 3,071 participate in the SBP. The
sample size falls to 7,824 when we analyze …fth grade outcomes. Table 3 provides summary statistics.
In light of the Monte Carlo results, we start with a linear model and then gradually add higher order
and interaction terms for the continuous covariates as a speci…cation check. In addition, in the interest
of brevity, we do not present any of the estimators based on non-normality given their poor performance;
even if the model is under-speci…ed, MB is preferred to MB-EE when the errors are heteroskedastic (as
they are in this case) and the focus is on the ATE.18

Results
Baseline Speci…cations

The results are presented in Tables 4–6, where Table 4 contains the results using BMI growth to measure
child health and Table 5 (Table 6) displays the results using overweight (obesity) status as the outcome.
Panel A in each table displays the estimates of the ATE, while Panel B presents the ATT estimates. As
stated above, we present the results from three speci…cations: Speci…cation (1) includes only linear terms
in X; Speci…cation (2) adds squared and interaction terms for the continuous covariates; Speci…cation (3)
17

Percentiles are obtained using the -zanthro- command in Stata.
While we present results for both the ATE and ATT, the ATE is of more relevance to policymakers interested in expanding
participation in the SBP to reach new students in order to potentially combat the rise in childhood obesity.
18

24

includes cubic terms for the continuous covariates and interaction terms among the linear and squared terms
involving the continuous covariates. Finally, 90% con…dence intervals for all the estimates are obtained by
bootstrap with 250 repetitions.19
Turning to the results in Table 4, OLS and HI indicate a positive and statistically signi…cant association
between SBP and BMI growth regardless of whether one measures growth between …rst and third grade
or …rst and …fth grade, regardless of whether one focuses on the ATE or ATT, and regardless of model
speci…cation. In terms of magnitudes, the results indicate that SBP participation in …rst grade is associated
with roughly a 1% (2.5%) increase in BMI growth for the average student between …rst and third (…fth)
grade according to HI.
If we consider the model to be under-speci…ed, then the MB estimates with a small radius ( = 0:05) are
preferred and fail to …nd a statistically meaningful relationship between SBP and BMI growth. Notably,
while this arises in part due to a loss in precision, it also re‡ects in part a reduction in the point estimates.
For the ATE, the point estimates fall in magnitude between eight and 72 percent. For the ATT, the point
estimates fall between 75 and 111 percent using the third grade outcome, while they remain virtually
constant using the …fth grade outcome.
When we move on to the estimators designed to circumvent selection on unobservables, the point
estimates become negative regardless of outcome, parameter of interest, or speci…cation. Erring on the
side of over-specifying the model, the KV, BVN, and MB-BC estimators each roughly indicate a 1%
decrease in BMI growth for the average student between …rst and third grade according to Speci…cation
(3).20 In addition, the estimates are statistically signi…cant in all cases except for KV. For the …fth grade
outcome, the estimates range from a 2.1% (KV) to 4.4% (BVN) decline in BMI growth for the average
student, although none are statistically signi…cant. In terms of the ATT estimates, the point estimates
range from 1.2% to 3.7% depending on the estimator and the outcome. Again, none of the estimates are
statistically signi…cant.
In sum, the results in Table 4 indicate the importance of addressing positive selection into SBP on the
basis of weight trajectories in order to estimate the causal e¤ect of participation, as suggested in MTH.
Moreover, consistent with this view, the MB estimator is able to reduce the selection bias su¢ ciently
such that the positive and statistically signi…cant e¤ect obtained by estimators that require conditional
independence disappears. Finally, the KV, BVN, and MB-BC estimators each appear able to circumvent
this non-random selection and indicate, at worst, no impact of SBP on child weight and, at best, a small,
Note, when obtaining con…dence intervals for MB and MB-BC, we re-estimate P\
(X) within each bootstrap repetition.
For the KV estimator, we note that for all models estimated in this study, we reject the null of homoskedastic errors at
the p < 0:01 con…dence level. In addition, the F-statistic on the instrument in the …rst-stage is always well in excess of Stock
et al.’s (2002) rule-of-thumb value of ten. Detailed results are available from the authors upon request.

bene…cial causal e¤ect of participation.
Tables 5 and 6 present the results using overweight and obesity status as the outcome of interest. Qualitatively, the pattern of results across estimators, speci…cations, and parameters of interest are unchanged
from Table 4. The magnitudes, however, do suggest an economically more meaningful impact of SBP
participation. Speci…cally, according to the preferred Speci…cation (3), the HI estimates indicate that SBP
participation is associated with a 4.8% (3.4%) increase in the probability of being overweight in the third
grade for the average student (average student in the treatment group); a 2.8% (3.2%) increase in the
probability of being obese in the third grade for the average student (average student in the treatment
group). The point estimates are even larger when we measuring child status in …fth grade. However, the
corresponding estimates KV, BVN, and MB-BC estimates suggest a 8.8 to 23.0% decline in the probability
of being overweight in the third grade depending on which estimator one uses and whether one focuses on
the ATE or ATT; 10.8 to 27.8% when using …fth grade overweight status. Similarly, the three estimators
indicate a 7.6 to 18.2% decline in the probability of being obese in the third grade; 4.3 to 13.4% when using
…fth grade obesity status. As in Table 4, the KV estimates are never statistically signi…cant; the BVN and
MB-BC estimates are in some instances.
The combined results do paint a picture consistent with the results in MTH. Speci…cally, without
controlling for any selection on unobservables, SBP appears to be a contributing factor to the childhood
obesity crisis. However, when control for some of this selection by minimizing the bias, the results are
weakened somewhat. Finally, when we remove the bias entirely using the KV, BVN, or MB-BC estimator,
there is no longer any evidence that SBP contributes to childhood obesity, and in fact there is some
statistically meaningful evidence to the contrary.
6.3.2

Further Investigations

Before conclusing, we extend our analysis in two directions. The …rst direction relates to the presence of
underweight children. When conceived, the original focus of the SBP (and the NSLP) was on providing all
children with a minimum level of nutrition (Guthrie et al. 2009). Only recently, with the rise in childhood
obesity, has concern shifted to the upper end of the weight distribution, with these programs trying to help
children maintain a healthy weight (as opposed to being overweight). However, it is important to examine
if the SBP has lost site of its original mission in bringing underweight children into a healthy weight range.
To that end, we create a binary indicator for underweight status, de…ned as one if children have a BMI
below the 20th percentile.21 In light of the positive selection into the SBP on the basis of weight discussed
21

The CDC de…nes underweight as being below the …fth percentile. However, there are very few children below the …fth
percentile in the data; thus, we use a higher cut-o¤. In terms of trends, using the o¢ cial CDC de…nition of underweight,
the incidence of underweight children between the ages of six and eleven has declined from 5.3% in 1971–1974 to 2.7% in

26

previously, now we expect the selection on observables estimators to be biased downward.
The results are presented in Table 7. Consistent with our expectations, OLS and HI indicate a negative
association between SBP and the probability of being underweight regardless of whether one measures
weight in third or …fth grade, regardless of whether one focuses on the ATE or ATT, and regardless
of model speci…cation. In nearly all cases, the estimate is statistically signi…cant as well. In terms of
magnitudes, the results indicate that SBP participation in …rst grade is associated with roughly a 2.5%
decrease in the probability of being underweight in both third and …fth grade for the average student
according to HI.
If we consider the model to be under-speci…ed, then the MB estimates with a small radius ( = 0:05)
are preferred and fail to …nd a statistically meaningful relationship between SBP and being underweight.
This arises, by and large, from a decline in precision although the point estimates for the ATE do become
positive in Speci…cations (1) and (2) for …fth grade. Finally, when we move on to the estimators designed
to circumvent selection on unobservables, the point estimates are either negative and very close to zero
or become positive. While this is consistent the positive selection discussed in Tables 4–6, none of the
estimates are statistically signi…cant. Interpretting these statistically insigni…cant estimates as evidence
of no causal e¤ect of SBP participation on the probability of being underweight, in combination with our
prior …ndings in Tables 4–6, indicates that SBP combats childhod obesity without sacri…cing its original
goal of ensuring children are not malnourished.
Our …nal investigation relates to the possibility of measurement error in reported program participation.
To mitigate the possibility of measurement, we follow a strategy loosely based on Black et al. (2000) who
note that one can reduce the bias from measurement error in a binary regressor if one has two mis-measured
indicators and the measurement errors are independent. In such a case, the improved estimate is obtained
by de…ning a binary variable equal to one if both mis-measured indicators are equal to one. To that end,
we re-estimate the models in Tables 4–7 except now we de…ne the treatment as one if the student reported
eating breakfast at school in …rst and third grade (when using third grade outcomes) and …rst, third, and
…fth grade (when using …fth grade outcomes).22
In the interest of brevity, the results are relegated to Appendix C and we simply note that the results
are qualitatively unchanged. The two most noteworthy di¤erences are the fact that the KV estimates
are now statistically signi…cant in many instances, and the fact that the estimated e¤ects on …fth grade
outcomes are statistically signi…cant more often. This latter result presumably is due more to a re-de…ning
2003–2006 (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/underweight_children.pdf).
22
This exercise is merely meant to be suggestive. First, the assumption that measurement error in participation reports
across waves are independent is open for debate. Second, unlike Black et al. (2000), our multiple indicators come from di¤erent
points in time. As such, if there is no measurement error in the data, we are implicitly re-de…ning the treatment relative to
the treatment analyzed in Tables 4–7.

Conclusion

The program evaluation literature has expanded rapidly over the past decade. While our knowledge
concerning methods that are designed to provide consistent estimates of some measure of the causal e¤ect
of a binary treatment under conditional independence, as well as typical IV methods when conditional
independence fails, is relatively well developed, researchers are less informed about how to proceed when
conditional independence fails yet the usual type of exclusion restrictions is unavailable. In this study,
we aim to reduce this de…cit by proposing two new estimators for this situation, and then evaluating the
performance of our estimators as well as that of bivariate normal selection model, the selection model
extended to the case of non-normality, and a recently proposed IV estimator proposed in Klein and Vella
(2009) that relies on heteroskedasticity. In addition, we use these estimators to assess the causal impact
of a program of great interest to policymakers: the School Breakfast Program.
Our analysis leads to some general guidelines that applied researchers may wish to follow in similar
situations moving forward. First, in applications where the researcher believes conditional independence
holds, our minimum-biased estimator o¤ers a nice robustness check since it performs nearly as well when
the model is correctly speci…ed or over-speci…ed, but vastly better when the model is under-speci…ed.
Second, when conditional independence does not hold but the model is correctly speci…ed or over-speci…ed,
our bias-corrected estimator does quite well, even outperforming estimators relying purely on functional
form for identi…cation. Third, our parametric Klein and Vella (2009) estimator performs very well when
the error in the treatment equation is in fact heteroskedastic, but still does well when this is not the case.
Finally, consistent with Millimet and Tchernis (2009), in all cases the penalty to over-specifying the model,
if there is one at all, pales in comparison to the penalty from under-specifying the model. However, the
KV estimator appears to be most sensitive to over-…tting.
In terms of our analysis of the SBP, the various estimators o¤er a coherent picture of the causal e¤ect of
the program. Speci…cally, we …nd a positive and statistically signi…cant association between SBP and child
weight when using estimators that require conditional independence. The association remains positive,
but becomes statistically insigni…cant, when we use our minimum-biased estimator. Finally, consistent
with the suggestive evidence in MTH, as well as Bhattacharya et al. (2006), we …nd a negative and
mostly statistically signi…cant causal e¤ect of SBP participation on child weight using the bivariate normal
selection model and Klein and Vella’s (2009) estimator, as well as our bias-corrected estimator.
While promising, further analysis on the econometric side may prove fruitful by considering the choice

28

of

or di¤erential weighting of observations within the neighborhood around P . In addition, one may wish

to consider a bias-corrected estimator of the unconditional average treatment e¤ect when the treatment
e¤ect is heterogeneous. For instance, one might wish to obtain a bias-corrected estimate conditional on
the propensity score, P (X), and then estimate the unconditional average treatment e¤ect by taking the
expectation of this over the distribution of X in the population (or sub-population of treated). Finally,
future work may compare the estimators considered here to other estimators that circumvent the need for
an exclusion restriction; for instance, those considered in Ebbes et al. (2009) for continuous endogenous
regressors. In terms of the analysis of the SBP, future analysis into the impact of participation on other
outcomes, such as cognitive and non-cognitive skills, will provide policymakers with better information
about the potential bene…ts of the program.

Notes: Numbers reflect the root mean squared error based on 250 simulated data sets with 5,000 observations. HI = Hirano and Imbens (2001) estimator; MB = minimum-biased estimator using a cut-off level (α)
chosen to retain 5% or 25% of the treatment and control groups; KV = Klein and Vella (2009) estimator; BVN = Heckman bivariate normal selection model; MB-BC = bias corrected estimator using a cut-off level
(α) chosen to retain 5% or 25% of the treatment and control groups. EE implies estimator relies on the Edgeworth expansion formula. Shading indicates best performance within each column. See text for further
details.

Notes: Treatment is defined as participation in SBP in first grade. BMI growth measured from fall first grade. Specification
(1) includes all variables from Table 3 entered linearly; Specification (2) adds squared and interaction terms for the
continuous covariates; Specification (3) adds cubic and interaction terms for the continuous covariates. 90% empirical
confidence intervals in brackets are obtained using 250 bootstrap repetitions. OLS = ordinary least squares; HI = Hirano
and Imbens (2001) normalized estimator; MB = minimum-biased estimator using θ = 0.0.5 or 0.25; KV = Klein and Vella
(2009) estimator; BVN = Heckman bivariate normal selection model; MB-BC = bias-corrected estimator using θ = 0.0.5 or
0.25; and, P* is the bias-minimizing propensity score.

Notes: Figures represent root mean squared errors. Results based on 50 data sets with 250,000 observations each. Specification (1) is under-specified (relevant higher order terms are excluded); specifica
(2) is correctly specified; specification (3) is over-specified (irrelevant higher order terms are included); specification (4) is over-specified (irrelevant higher order terms and an irrelevant variable are
included). Shading indicates best performance within each column. See text and Table 1 for further details.
