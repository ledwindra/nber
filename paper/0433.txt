Money and Price Dispersion in the United States

ABSTRACT

This paper reports an empirical test of a price dispersion equation, using

data on the U.S. after World War II. The equation, derived elsewhere from a
version of the partial information—localized market models, relates price dis-

persion to the magnitude of changes in the aggregate disturbances. In order to
test the model a series on price dispersion is computed using annual wholesale

price indexes for the period 1948—76. The data on money shocks are the unanticipated money growth series estimated by Barro. The tests also include a measure
of aggregate—real disturbances.

From the theoretical point of view the results are negative. They reject
the hypothesis that unexpected money shocks, as measured by Barro, affect price

dispersion in the way predicted by the model. In a previous paper, a similar
model was tested with data from the German hyperinflation and found supported to

a considerable extent. The difference in the results may be related to the ex—
treme magnitude of the monetary disturbances during that period, and to the apparently important effect of unincluded relative disturbances in the United States.

This paper reports an empirical test of a price dispersion equation,

using data on the U.S. after World War II. The equation is derived in
Hercowitz (1979) from a theoretical framework that is a version of Lucas's
(1973) and Barro's (1976) partial information—localized market models,
In this extension, which is briefly summarized in section I, each commodity

is characterized by a particular excess demand elasticity, The different
reactions to money shocks across markets t.ipiy a testable dispersion equation

in which the explanatory variables are the magnitude of changes in the aggre-

gate disturbances. The data on money shocks used in the tests are the unantici-

pated money growth series estimated by Barro (1978). The series on price
dispersion is computed using annual wholesale price indexes for the period
1948/76. Vining and Elwertowski (1976) have performed similar computations
with a more extensive disaggregation, but using the unweighted price changes,
The procedure adopted here in the calculations is reported in section II.

Using these figures, the dispersion equation is tested in section III

From the theoretical point of view the results are negative, They reject
the hypothesis that unexpected money shocks

,

as measured by Barro (1978),

affect price dispersion via the channel described in section I.

In my pre-

vious paper, a similar model was tested with data from the German hyperinfla-

tion and found supported to a considerable extent. The difference in the
results may be related to the extreme magnitude of the monetary disturbances
during that period, arid to the apparently important effect of real factors-which directly affect relative excess demands-—in the United States.

The results in this paper are also not in line with previous findings
related to price dispersion in the U.S.

Vining and Elwertowski (1976)

show that the variance of relative prices tends to increase with the magni-

tude of changes in the rate of inflation.1 Parks (1978) tested a model in

—2—

whIch price change dispersion depends on the magnitude of changes in real

income and unexpected inflation, which is measured by the changes In the

inflation rate (minus a constant).2 Parks' empirical results strongly support
his model,,

In the theoretical framework used here, unanticipated inflation is generated

by unexpected money or aggregate-real shocks. These disvrbances also effect
relative prices and thus this model offers a rationalization of the previous

findings in terms of the effects of exogenous shocks. Since,

empirically,

the link between money disturbances and price dispersion is found absent, the

explanation offered bythe model is not supported by the data. The additional
variable considered, the magnitude of changes in a measure of aggregate-real
shocks, seems to have a positive correlation with price dispersion,
In any

event, the apparent regularity of the phenomenon that price dis—

persion is related to the magnitude of changes in the inflation rate still
lacks a satisfactory explanation in terms of the effects of exogenous shocks
or policy variables.

T,

Review of the model.
This section contains a short outline of the model described in Section I

of my previous paper. The only difference introduced here is an aggregate
supply shock that affects equally all markets.
The central feature in the localized market models of the type used here,
is the combination of competitive markets--in which demand and supply are
functions of the perceived relative price-—and partial current information.

Agents lack knowledge about prices prevailing contemporaneously in other markets,

and observe only the local price. The information set available to the agents
contains-also lagged variables and some incomplete knowledge about factors govern-

ing the current

period money

growth.

ia-this mcde1 each location is interpreted as the market of a specific

commodity, d. it is characterized by a particular relative price elasticity
of excess demand. With different elasticities across. markets, unperceived
aggregate disturbances have a different impact on each commodity price, and
thus generate dispersion of prices. The supply and demand for a particular
commodity are aggregations of individual supplies and deiands by a large

elasticity of supply, which is seen as depending on the particular

production process of commodity z. v represents real aggregate supply shocks.
This term can be thought of as, for example, changes in technology or in the

availability of resources such as energy. v is assumed to be normally
distributed with zero mean and variance

One could specify, as in

Section II. Computation of the price dispersion measure: U.S. 1948-1976

A price dispersion series is constructed using annual average wholesale

price data contained in the Bureau of Labor Statistics WPI subfile taoe. The
computation

has three steps: 1) calculation of the rates of changes

ual prices between each pair of

consecutive

years in the sample, 2)

in individ-

calculation

of the weight that each commodity has in the total value of sales in primary

-6—

markets, and 3) computation of the average and

variance

of the price changes

using the Individual rates of change and weigfits calculated in 1) and 2).

The computed values are shown

in

columns (1) and 2) of table I.

Individual commodities are defined here as the subgroups of items

comprising the WPI. There are 86 of thtc subgroups at the beginning
of the sample in 1948, and 97 of them at its end in 1976. This disaggre—
gation is obtained using the three digit code Indexes in the WPI subfile

tape, A report of the procedure adopted in the computations is given in
more detail in the appendix.
?Qhereas the problem of the WPI data--discussed by Stigler and Kindahi

(1970)-—that they do not always reflect discounts from list prices and other
terms of trade, it seems that the use of rates of changes in annual average

data diminishes considerably this possible error of measurement. The discrepancy between the WPI indexes and those constructed by Stigler and Kindahi
is, in general, materially less pronounced when the time unit is a year

than when it is shorter. This discrepancy is particularly small in the
rates of price change of metals and fuels, which, in terms of their relative
importance, are the bulk of the commodities that they consider.

Section III. Empirical Results

This section reports an attempt to test equation (6) using U.S. data

for the period 1948-1976. The

and v series employed in the tests are

the residuals in money growth and output equations respectively, as estimated

by Barro (1978). In that study, money growth was regressed on a number of
current and lagged variables that were considered relevant to predict it
Accordingly, the residuals in the equation were interpreted as the unexpected

money growth shocks. The inclusion of a contemporaneous variable--related

to govement spending--suggests that the residuals could also be interpreted

—7—

as currently unperceived money, which is the monetary variable that is theoretically relevant here.4
Barro then regressed output on current and past values of the estimated

money shocks. The residuals in this equation are considered here as the
nonnionetary or real disturbances, and are used as values of the v variable.5
In general, however, these residuals are not equal but proportional to

In the framework of this model, the coeffii,.nt of v in the aggregate output equation is computed by solving for output in z and then averaging across

markets. The resulting expression for the (log of the) geometric average
output in the economy is:

The coefficient of v is positive and less than one since dx <

can be observed that this inequality also implies that monetary shocks

have a positive effect on output. According to this equation, the residuals
in the regression of output on money shocks are interpreted as the real aggre+

gate shocks times the coefficient

Note that this interpretation

relies on an implicit assumption made in the specification of the model that
real aggregate shocks affecting the demand side are of minor importance relative to the supply shocks, and therefore can be neglected..

The variances included in the coefficients are considered constant during

the sample period. Shifts in these variances could be another source of
variation in y. Some reference to thi.s possibility is made below.
As expressed in equation (7), the model predicts that the absolute value
of the changes in both monetary and real shocks will positively affect dis-

persion. This effect is attributable to unequal quantity and price response
to unexpected shocks across markets. From the point of view of this hypothesis,
the empirical results are in general unsatisfactory and especially negative

with respect to the monetary disturbances. The coefficient of the (m -

variable

has the 'wrong' sign in all the equations estimated, although the

estimated coefficients are also insignificantly different from zero. On
the other hand, the real shock variable appears significantly to affect
dispersion in the way predicted by the model.

The results here are essentially similar to those obtained in the first

The additional two measures of price change dispersion used are the

ones computed by Vining and Elwertowski (1976). From the individual items
indexes comprising the tho1esale Price Index, they constructed series of
the sample standard deviations of the unweighted individual price changes

for the period 1948-1974. This series is denoted here by (Y).p The
number of items entering each year in the computation ranges from 1159 to

2033. They performed also similar computations using the Consumer Price
Index components. The number of items considered for each year ranges
from 110 to 311. The symbol used here for this series is

All the equations estimated yield approximately the same results

although with differences in the goodness of fit. These results amount to a
rejection of the hypothesis, that the magnitude of changes in monetary

shocks, as measured by Barro (1978), positively affects dispersion of
relative prices through the particular channel described in section I.
From the standpoint of this hypothesis, a particularly negative piece

of evidence is the monetary contraction in 1960. In this year, the value

of (m -

rni)2

is the highest in the sample, at the time that price

dispersion is extremely low-—as it continues to be during the early six-ties.

With respect to the real shocks

the

evidence seem. to some extent to

support the hypothesis implied bythe model. However, even with this result

some caution is in order. If one believes that real shocks hit different
markets unequally, they could cause dispersion also or perhaps only by,

shifting the current 2• For example, the oil price shock in late 1973

the

greater the effect of the oil price increase on that industry. There-

fore, besIdes the aggregate impact of this disturbance, It also represents
an intensification of the relative differences of excess demand among the

markets, with the result of a larger price change dispersion.8
The importance

of

real-relative disturbances that directly affect the

magnitudes of relative excess demands is suggested by the observations corresponding to 1974 and the years that follcw, by 1973-—a year of a sharp

foreign demand increase for food products--and by the Korean 1ar. These
types of factors are considered neither in the theoretical model nor directly

in the empirical analysis. However, if the constructed monetary shock series
is independent of these factors, the present procedure for estimating monetary
effects on dispersion would still be satisfactory.

IV. Summary and Conclusions:

The aim of this paper was to test with U.S. data a model of price dispersion in which monetary and real-aggregate shocks are the explanatory variables
However, the effect of money shocks that the model predicts—-on which this

paper is mainly concerned--is not found in the data. Possibly, this effect
is of small magnitude relative to that of apparently important excluded variables, and thus is difficult to detect in the present empirical framework.

This conjecture is based on a comparison of these results with those from
the German hyperinflation, as reported in Hercowitz (1979). In that period,
in which

money growth is

a predominant factor, a dispersion model of the type

used here receives substantial support.
In this version of Lucas's (1973) and Barro's (1976) models, money

shocks affect both relative prices and aggregate output. The effect on

—12—

output, well known from those models, occurs because of incomplete inforina-

tion. The additional effect on price dispersion, results from the interaction
between incomplete information and different supply elasticities across

markets. Empirically, Barro (1977, 1978) found that unariticiapted money

has a strong effect on unemployment and output. Using the same monetary
variable, the additional hypothesis derived from this extension is rejected.
This result is reconciled with Barro's if all markets have the same price

elasticity, In this case, the effect on output remains, but that on price
dispersion is absent. However, the assumption of equal short run price
elasticities in all sectors seems fairly strong.

1) Calculation of individual price rates of change.

The indexes used are annual averages. Their rates of change are computed
by the first difference in the logarithms of the indexes, namely

of commodity I at time t and

P11

are the price indexes

t-l.

2) Calculation of the weights assigned to each commodity.
Here I am refering briefly to the methodology of the computation of

the WPI. For details see Wholesale Prices and

Price

tndexes (1973). The

weights assigned to the commodities comprising the WPI are the percentages

of

the

primary

sales

of the various commodities in the total of primary

sales.

The values of these weights are not available for each year. During the
sample period, Industrial Censuses were carried on in 1952/53, 1954, 1958,
1963, and

1972.

Major

revisions

of the weights were performed a few years

after each census, in January of the years 1955, 1958, 1961, 1967, and

1976,

when these data became available. From one year to the next between two
major revisions, the weights were updated by the rate of change in the commodity price, and

then

normalized to get their sum

equal

to one. This

procedure implies the assumption that the quantities are constant between
two major revisions and

that

only the differential price changes affect

the share of each commodity in the total sales.
Since I did riot find available the computed weights for each year in

the sample, I used the same procedure and the published weights data for
December 1954, 1957, 1960, 1966, and 1975 to calculate the intermediate

years figures. More concisely, having the weights for T

figures for the intermediate years

are computed as follows

A likely minor additional point is that the weights assigned to each

3The FEDV variable. For its definition, see Barro (1978).

4However, Ba.rro and Hercowitz (1979) found that this measure of unanti-

cipated money is uncorrelated with the amounts of the revisLons in the published
money stock data, which can be considered as unperceived money at the time of
the first publication.

5The output equation in Barro (1978) contains also a military conscrip-.
tion variable, which could also be considered as a real shock. However, the
v variable values are theoretically considered unperceived as such during
period t.

The military conscription hardly can be thought of as being

currently unperceived and therefore,
