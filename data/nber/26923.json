    "abstract": "\n\nTobacco regulation has been a major component of health policy in the developed world since the UK\u2019s Royal College of Physicians\u2019 and the U.S. Surgeon General\u2019s reports in the 1960s.  Such regulation, which has intensified in the past two decades, includes cigarette taxation, place-based smoking bans in areas ranging from bars and restaurants to workplaces, and regulations designed to make tobacco products less desirable.  More recently, the availability of alternative products, most notably e-cigarettes, has increased dramatically, and these products are just starting to be regulated.  Despite an extensive body of research on tobacco regulations, there remains substantial debate regarding their effectiveness, and ultimately, their impact on economic welfare.  We provide the first comprehensive review of the state of research in the economics of tobacco regulation in two decades.\n\n",
