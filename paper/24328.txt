The Optimal Inflation Target and the Natural Rate of Interest

NBER Working Paper No. 24328
February 2018
JEL No. E31,E51,E58
ABSTRACT
We study how changes in the value of the steady-state real interest rate affect the optimal
inflation target, both in the U.S. and the euro area, using an estimated New Keynesian DSGE
model that incorporates the zero (or effective) lower bound on the nominal interest rate. We find
that this relation is downward sloping, but its slope is not necessarily one-for-one: increases in the
optimal inflation rate are generally lower than declines in the steady-state real interest rate. Our
approach allows us not only to assess the uncertainty surrounding the optimal inflation target, but
also to determine the latter while taking into account the parameter uncertainty facing the policy
maker, including uncertainty with regard to the determinants of the steady-state real interest rate.
We find that in the currently empirically relevant region for the US as well as the euro area, the
slope of the curve is close to -0.9. That finding is robust to allowing for parameter uncertainty

Introduction

A recent but sizable literature has pointed to a permanent –or, at least very persistent– decline in the
“natural” rate of interest in advanced economies (Holston et al., 2017, Laubach and Williams, 2016). Various
likely sources of that decline have been discussed, including a lower trend growth rate of productivity
(Gordon, 2015), or an enhanced preference for safe assets (Caballero and Farhi, 2015, Summers, 2014).
A lower steady-state real interest rate matters for monetary policy. Given average inflation, a lower
steady-state real rate will cause the nominal interest rate to hit its zero lower bound (ZLB) more frequently,
hampering the ability of monetary policy to stabilize the economy, bringing about more frequent (and
potentially protracted) episodes of recessions and below-target inflation.
In the face of that risk, and in order to counteract it, several prominent economists have forcefully argued in favor of raising the inflation target (see, among others, Ball 2014, Blanchard et al. 2010, Williams
2016). Since a lower natural rate of interest is conducive to a higher ZLB incidence, one would expect
a higher inflation target to be desirable in that case. But the answer to the practical question of by how
much should the target be increased is not obvious. Indeed, the benefit of providing a better hedge against
hitting the ZLB, which is an infrequent event, comes at a cost of higher steady-state inflation which induces permanent costs, as recently argued by Bernanke (2016) among others. The answer to this question
thus requires to assess how the tradeoff between the incidence of the ZLB and the welfare cost induced by
steady-state inflation is modified when the natural rate of interest decreases. While the decrease in the natural rate of interest has been emphasized in the recent literature, this assessment has received surprisingly
little attention.
The present paper contributes to this debate by asking two questions. First, to what extent does a lower
steady-state real interest rate (r ? ) call for a higher optimal inflation target (π ? )? Second, does the source of
decline in r ? matter? Our main contribution is to characterize how the optimal inflation target is related
to the steady-state real interest rate, using a structural, empirically estimated, macroeconomic model. Our
main findings can be summarized as follows: (i) The relation between r ? and π ? is downward sloping, but
not necessarily one-for-one; (ii) in the vicinity of the pre-crisis values for r ? , the slope of the (r ? , π ? ) locus is
close to −0.9 ; and (iii) for a plausible range of r ? values the relation is largely robust to the underlying
source of variation in r ? .
Our results are obtained from extensive simulations of a New Keynesian DSGE model estimated for
both the US and the euro area over a Great Moderation sample. The framework features: (i) price stickiness
and imperfect indexation of prices to non-zero trend inflation, (ii) wage stickiness and imperfect indexation
of wages to both inflation and technical progress, and (iii) a ZLB constraint on the nominal interest rate. The
first two features imply the presence of potentially substantial costs associated with non-zero wage or price
inflation. The third feature warrants a strictly positive inflation rate, in order to mitigate the incidence and

2

adverse effects of the ZLB. To our knowledge, these three features have not been jointly taken into account
in previous analyses of optimal inflation.
According to our simulations, the pre-crisis optimal inflation target obtained when the policymaker is
assumed to know the economy’s parameters with certainty (and taken to correspond to the mode of the
posterior distribution) is around 2% for the US and around 1.5% for the euro area (in annual terms). This
result is obtained in an environment with a relatively low probability of hitting the ZLB (6% for the US
and slightly less than 10% for the euro area) , given the small shocks estimated on our Great Moderation
sample.
A further noticeable feature of our approach is that we perform a full-blown Bayesian estimation of the
model, using both US and euro area data. This allows us not only to assess the uncertainty surrounding
π ? , but also to derive an optimal inflation target taking into account the parameter uncertainty facing the
policy maker, including uncertainty with regard to the determinants of the steady-state real interest rate.
When that parameter uncertainty is allowed for, those values increase significantly: 2.40% for the US and
2.20% for the euro area The reason why the optimal targets under parameter uncertainty are higher has
to do with the fact that the loss function is asymmetric so that choosing an inflation target that is lower
than the optimal one is more costly than choosing an inflation target that is above. That being said it
remains true that a Bayesian-theoretic optimal inflation target rises by about 90 basis points in response to
a downward shift of the distribution in r ? of 100 basis points.

1.1

Related Literature

To our knowledge no paper has systematically investigated the (r ? , π ? ) relation. Coibion et al. (2012) (and
its follow-up Dordal-i-Carreras et al. (2016)) and Kiley and Roberts (2017) are the papers most closely related to ours, as they study optimal inflation in quantitative set-ups that account for the ZLB. However,
their analyses hold for a constant steady-state natural rate of interest. Relative to both papers, a key difference is our focus on eliciting the relation between the steady-state real interest rate and optimal inflation.
Other differences are (i) our interest in the euro area, in addition to the US; (ii) we estimate, rather than
calibrate, the model, and (iii) we allow for wage rigidity in the form of infrequent, staggered, wage adjustments. A distinctive feature with respect to Kiley and Roberts (2017) is that we use a model-consistent,
micro-founded loss function to compute optimal inflation.
A series of papers assessed the probability of hitting the ZLB for a given inflation target (see, among
others, Chung et al. 2012, Coenen 2003, Coenen et al. 2004). Interestingly, our own assessment of this precrisis ZLB incidence falls broadly in the ballpark of available estimates. A related recent contribution by
Gust et al. (2017) emphasizes that the ZLB was indeed a significant constraint on monetary policy that
exacerbated the recession and inhibited the recovery.1 Lindé et al. (2017) offer a discussion of alternative
1 Gust

et al. (2017) rely on global solution methods while we resort to the lighter algorithms developed by Bodenstein et al.

3

methods to implement the ZLB at the estimation stage.
Other relevant references, albeit ones that put little or no emphasis on the ZLB, are the following.
Ascari et al. (2015) study optimal inflation in a model with nominal rigidities. As we do, they include
wage rigidity, but do not incorporate the ZLB. Khan et al. (2003) was one of the first papers to study
optimal inflation with sticky prices, along with demand for money motives. Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe
(2010) review various determinants of the long-run inflation rate, including some not considered in the
present paper (e.g., transactions frictions, changes in product quality). Amano et al. (2009) show that
optimal inflation might be negative in a model with prices and wages both sticky. Adding search and
matching frictions to the setup, Carlsson and Westermark (2016) show, by contrast, that optimal inflation
can be positive. Bilbiie et al. (2014) find positive optimal inflation can be an outcome in a sticky-price model
with endogenous entry and product variety. Somewhat related, Adam and Weber (2017) show that, even
without any ZLB concern, optimal inflation might be positive in the context of a model with heterogeneous
firms and systematic firm-level productivity trends. Finally, using a perpetual youth model, Lepetit (2017)
shows that optimal inflation can be positive in the presence of heterogeneous discount factor, especially
when the social planner is more patient than agents.
Among the recent papers with ZLB, Blanco (2016) studies optimal inflation in a state-dependent pricing
model, i.e. a “menu cost” model (see also Burstein and Hellwig 2008 for a similar exercise without ZLB,
which leads to negative optimal inflation rate). As a matter of fact, Nakamura et al. (2016) argue that
the presence of state-dependent pricing limits considerably the positive relationship between inflation and
price dispersion, thus limiting the costs of inflation.

2

The Model

We use a relatively standard medium-scale New Keynesian model as a framework of reference. Crucially,
the model features elements that generate a cost to inflation: (1) nominal rigidities, in the form of staggered
price and wage setting; (2) less than perfect price (and wage) indexation to past or trend inflation; and (3)
trend productivity growth along, to which wages are imperfectly indexed.
As is well known, staggered price setting generates a positive relation between deviations from zero
inflation and price dispersion (with the resulting inefficient allocation of resources). Moreover, the lack
of indexation to trend magnifies these costs, as emphasized by Ascari and Sbordone (2014). Also, and
ceteris paribus, price inflation induces (nominal) wage inflation, which in turn triggers inefficient wage
dispersion in the presence of staggered wage setting. Imperfect indexation also magnifies the costs of
non-zero price (or wage) inflation as compared to a set-up where price and wages mechanically catch up
(2009) and Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2015). Given the large set of inflation targets and real interest rates that we need to consider
(and given that these have to be considered for each and every parameter configuration in our simulations), a global solution
would be computationally prohibitive.

with trend inflation. Finally the lack of a systematic indexation of wages to productivity also induces an
inefficient wage dispersion.
At the same time, there are benefits associated to a positive inflation rate, as interest rates are subject to
a ZLB constraint. In particular, and given the steady-state real interest rate, the incidence of binding ZLB
episodes should decline with the average rate of inflation. Such episodes hamper the stabilization potential
of monetary policy.
Overall, the model we use, and the trade-off between costs and benefits of steady-state inflation, are
close to those considered by Coibion et al. (2012). However we assume sticky wages, in addition to sticky
prices.

2.1

Households

The economy is inhabited by a continuum of measure one of infinitely-lived, identical households. The
representative household is composed of a continuum of workers, each specialized in a particular labor
type indexed by h ∈ [0, 1]. The representative household’s objective is to maximize an intertemporal
welfare function

where β ≡ e−ρ is the discount factor (ρ being the discount rate), Et {·} is the expectation operator conditional on information available at time t, Ct is consumption and Nt (h) is the supply of labor of type h. The
utility function features habit formation, with degree of habits η. The inverse Frisch elasticity of labor supply is ν and χ is a scale parameter in the labor disutility. The utility derived from consumption is subject to
a preference shock ζ g,t .

a “risk-premium” shock, Bt is the quantity of such bonds acquired at t, Tt denotes lump-sum taxes, and Dt
stands for the dividends rebated to the households by monopolistic firms.

Firms and Price Setting

Intermediate goods are produced by monopolistic firms, each specialized in a particular good f ∈ [0, 1].
Firm f has technology
Yt ( f ) = Zt Lt ( f )1/φ .
where Lt ( f ) is the input of aggregate labor, 1/φ is the elasticity of production with respect to aggregate
labor, and Zt is an index of aggregate productivity. The latter evolves according to
Zt = Zt−1 eµz +ζ z,t
where µz is the average growth rate of productivity. Thus, technology is characterized by a unit root in the
model.
Intermediate goods producers are subject to nominal rigidities à la Calvo. Formally, firms face a constant probability α p of not being able to re-optimize prices. In the event that firm f is not drawn to reoptimize at t, it re-scales its price according to the indexation rule
Pt ( f ) = [(Π)1−ι p (Πt−1 )ι p ]γ p Pt−1 ( f )
where Πt ≡ Pt /Pt−1 , Π is the associated steady-state value, ι p ∈ [0, 1] and 0 ≤ γ p < 1. Thus, in case firm
f is not drawn to re-optimize, it mechanically re-scales its price using a geometric average of steady-state
inflation and past inflation. Importantly, however, we assume that the degree of indexation is less than
perfect since γ p < 1.

We further assume that
1 + τp,t = (1 + τp )e−ζ u,t ,
with ζ u,t appearing in the system as a cost-push shock. Furthermore, we set τp so as to neutralize the
steady-state distortion induced by price markups.

where Nt is the quantity of aggregate labor and Nt (h) is the input of labor of type h, and where θw denotes
the elasticity of substitution between any two labor types. Aggregate labor Nt is then used as an input in
the production of intermediate goods. Equilibrium in the labor market thus requires
Nt =

Here, it is important to notice the difference between Lt ( f ), the demand for aggregate labor emanating
from firm f , and Nt (h), the supply of labor of type h by the representative household.

where Wt is the nominal wage paid to aggregate labor while Wt (h) is the nominal wage paid to labor of

Mirroring prices, we assume that wages are subject to nominal rigidities, à la Calvo, in the manner of
Erceg et al. (2000). Formally, unions face a constant probability αw of not being able to re-optimize wages.
In the event that union h is not drawn to re-optimize at t, it re-scales its wage according to the indexation
rule
Wt (h) = eγz µz [(Π)1−ιw (Πt−1 )ιw ]γw Wt−1 (h)
where, as before, wages are indexed to a geometric average of steady-state inflation and past inflation, with
ι w ∈ [0, 1]. However, we assume that the degree of indexation is here too less than perfect by imposing
0 ≤ γw < 1. In addition, nominal wages are also indexed to average productivity growth with indexation
degree 0 ≤ γz < 1.

2.4

Monetary Policy and the ZLB

Monetary policy in "normal times" is assumed to be given by a Taylor-like interest rate rule

ı̂t = ρi ı̂t−1 + (1 − ρi ) aπ π̂t + ay x̂t + ζ R,t

(3)

where it ≡ − log( Qt ), with ı̂t denoting the associated deviation from steady state i.e, ı̂t ≡ it − i. Also,
πt ≡ log Πt , π̂t ≡ πt − π is the gap between inflation and its target, and x̂t ≡ log(Yt /Ytn ) where Ytn is the
natural level of output, defined as the level of output that would prevail in an economy with flexible prices
and wages and no cost-push shocks. Finally, ζ R,t is a monetary policy shock.
Here, π should be interpreted as the central bank target for change in the price index. An annual
inflation target of 2% would thus imply π = 2/400 = 0.005 as the model will be parameterized and
estimated with quarterly data. Note that the inflation target thus defined may differ from average inflation.
Crucially for our purpose, the nominal interest rate it is subject to a ZLB constraint:
it ≥ 0
The steady-state level of the real interest rate is defined by r ? ≡ i − π. Given logarithmic utility, it is
related to technology and preference parameter according to r ? = ρ + µz . Combining these elements, it is
convenient to write the ZLB constraint in terms the deviation of the nominal interest rate
ı̂t ≥ −(µz + ρ + π )

(4)

The rule effectively implemented is given by:

ı̂nt = ρi ı̂nt−1 + (1 − ρi ) aπ π̂t + ay x̂t + ζ R,t
ı̂t = max{ı̂nt , −(µz + ρ + π )}
This specification allows the nominal interest rate ı̂t to stay lower for longer insofar as the state of the
economy warrants a protracted period of time with a negative notional rate ı̂nt .
8

Before proceeding, a remark is in order. The inflation target, π, is not assumed to be optimal. Note also
that realized inflation might be on average below the target as a consequence of ZLB episodes, i.e. E{πt } <
π. In such instances of ZLB, monetary policy fails to deliver the appropriate degree of accommodation,
resulting in a more severe recession and lower inflation than in an economy in which there would not be a
ZLB constraint.2
As equation (4) makes clear, µz , ρ, π have symmetric roles in the ZLB constraint. Put another way, for
given structural parameters and a given process for ı̂t , the probability of hitting the ZLB would remain
unchanged if productivity growth or the discount rate decline by one percent and the inflation target is
increased by a commensurate amount at the same time. Based on these observations, one may be tempted
to argue that in response to a permanent decline in µz or ρ, the optimal inflation target π ∗ will change by
the same amount (with a negative sign).
The previous conjecture is, however, incorrect. The reasons for this are twofold. First, any change
in µz (or ρ) also translates into a change in the coefficients of the equilibrium dynamic system. It turns
out that this effect is non-negligible since, as we show later, after a one percentage point decline in r ∗ the
inflation target has to be raised by more than one percent in order to keep the probability of hitting the
ZLB unchanged Second, because there are welfare costs associated with increasing the inflation target, the
policy maker would also have to balance the benefits of keeping the incidence of ZLB episodes constant
with the additional costs in terms of extra price dispersion and inefficient resource allocation. These costs
can be substantial and more than compensate for the benefits of holding the probability of ZLB constant.
Assessing these forces is precisely this paper’s endeavor.

2.5

Solution Method

Because the model has a stochastic trend, we first induce stationarity by dividing trending variables by
Zt . The resulting system is then log-linearized in the neighborhood of its deterministic steady state.3 We
append to the system a set of equations describing the dynamics of the structural shocks, namely
ζ k,t = ρk ζ k,t−1 + σk ek,t ,

ek,t ∼ N (0, 1)

for k ∈ { R, g, u, q, z}.
Absent the ZLB constraint, the model can be solved and cast into the usual linear transition and observation equations:
st = T (θ )st−1 + R(θ )et ,

xt = M(θ ) + H(θ )st ,

with st a vector collecting the model’s state variables, xt a vector of observable variables and et a vector of
innovations to the shock processes et = (eR,t , eg,t , eu,t , eq,t , ez,t )0 . The solution coefficients are regrouped in
2 For

convenience, Table A.1 in the Appendix summarizes the various notions of optimal inflation and long-run or target

inflation considered in this paper
3 See the Technical Appendix for further details.

9

the conformable matrices T (θ ), R(θ ), M(θ ), and H(θ ) which depend on the vector of structural parameters θ.
The model becomes non-linear when one allows the ZLB constraint to bind. The solution method we
implement follows the approach developed by Bodenstein et al. (2009) and Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2015).
The approach can be described as follows. There are two regimes: the no-ZLB regime k = n and the ZLB
regime k = e and the canonical representation of the system in each regime is
Et {A(k) st+1 + B (k) st + C (k) st−1 + D (k) et } + f (k) = 0
where A(k) , B (k) , C (k) , and D (k) are conformable matrices and f (k) is a vector of constants. In the no-ZLB
regime, the vector f (n) is filled with zeros. In the ZLB regime, the row of f (e) associated with it is equal to
µz + ρ + π. Similarly, the rows of the system matrices associated with it in the no-ZLB regime correspond
to the coefficients of the Taylor rule while in the ZLB regime, the coefficient associated with it is equal to 1
and all the other coefficients are set to zero.
In each period t, given an initial state vector st−1 and vector stochastic innovations et , we simulate
the model under perfect foresight (i.e., assuming that no further shocks hit the economy) over the next N
periods, for N sufficiently large. In case this particular draw is not conducive to a ZLB episode, we find
st using the linear solution stated above. In contrast, if this draw leads to a ZLB episode, we postulate
integers Ne < N and Nx < N such that the ZLB is reached at time t + Ne and left at time t + Nx . In this
case, we solve the model by backward induction. We obtain the time varying solution
s t + q = d t + q + T t + q s t + q −1 + R t + q e t + q
where, for q ∈ { Ne , ..., Nx − 1}

using Tt+ Nx = T , Rt+ Nx = R, and dt+ Nx set to a column filled with zeros as initial conditions of the
backward recursion.
We then check that given the obtained solution, the system hits the ZLB at t + Ne and leaves the ZLB at
t + Nx . Otherwise, we shift Ne and/or Nx forward or backward by one period and start all over again until
convergence. Once convergence has been reached, we use the resulting matrices to compute st and repeat
the process for all the simulation periods.
10

Our approach is thus similar to the one used by Coibion et al. (2012) in their study of the optimal
inflation target in a New Keynesian setup.4

2.6

Estimation Results

We estimate the model using data for a pre-crisis period over which the ZLB constraint is not binding. This
enables us to use the linear version of the model. The sample of observable variables is XT ≡ { xt }tT=1 with
xt = [∆ log(GDPt ), ∆ log(GDP Deflatort ), ∆ log(Wagest ), Short Term Interest Ratet ]0
where the short term nominal interest rate is the effective Fed Funds Rate for the US and the Euribor 3
months rate for the Euro-Area.We use a sample of quarterly data covering the period 1985Q2-2009Q4. This
choice is guided by two objectives. First, this sample strikes a balance between size and the concern of
having a homogeneous monetary policy regime over the period considered. In the US case, the sample
covers the Volcker and post-Volcker period, arguably one of relative homogeneity of monetary policy.
For the euro area, the sample starts approximately when the disinflation policies were simultaneously
conducted in the main euro area countries (see Fève et al. 2010) and then covers the single currency period.
Here too, this corresponds to a period of relative monetary policy homogeneity. Second, we use a sample
that coincides more or less with the so-called Great Moderation. Over the latter, as has been argued in
the literature, we expect smaller shocks to hit the economy. In principle, this will lead to a conservative
assessment of the effects of the more stringent ZLB constraint due to lower real interest rates.

The parameters φ, θ p , θw , ι p , and ι w are calibrated prior to estimation. Given our specification of the
measurement equation, the parameters ι p and γ p and, likewise, ι w and γw , are not separately identified. In
effect, they appear in the dynamic system as products γ p ι p or γw ι w . We thus set ι p = ι w = 1 at the calibration stage. As long as ι w and ι w are not set to zero, the particular value chosen has no other consequence
on the estimation results than a reinterpretation of γw and γ p . The parameter φ is set to 1/0.7, resulting in
a steady-state labor share of 70%. The parameter θ p is set to 6, resulting in a steady-state markup of 20%.
Similarly, the parameter θw is set to 3, resulting in a wage markup of 50%.
We rely on a full-system Bayesian estimation approach to estimate the other model parameters. After
having cast the dynamic system in the state-space representation for the set of observable variables, we
use the Kalman filter to measure the likelihood of the observed variables. We then form the joint posterior
distribution of the structural parameters by combining the likelihood function p( XT |θ ) with a joint density
4 In

practice we combine the implementation of the Bodenstein et al. (2009) algorithm developed by Coibion et al. (2012) with

the solution algorithm and the parser from Dynare. Our implementation is in the spirit of Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2015), resulting
in a less user-friendly yet faster suite of programs.

characterizing some prior beliefs p(θ ). The joint posterior distribution thus obeys
p ( θ | X T ) ∝ p ( X T | θ ) p ( θ ),
Given the specification of the model, the joint posterior distribution cannot be recovered analytically
but may be computed numerically, using a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling approach. More
specifically, we rely on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain a random draw of size 1,000,000 from
the joint posterior distribution of the parameters.
Tables 1 and 2 present the parameter’s postulated priors (type of distribution, mean, and standard
error) and estimation results, i.e., the posterior mean and standard deviation, together with the bounds of
the 90% probability interval for each parameter.
For the parameters π, µz and ρ, we impose Gaussian prior distributions. The parameters governing
the latter are chosen so as to match the mean values of inflation, GDP growth, and the real interest rate in
our US and euro area samples. Other than for these three parameters, we use the same prior distributions
for the structural parameters in both the US and the euro area. Our choice of priors are standard. In
particular, we use Beta distributions for parameters in [0, 1], Gamma distributions for positive parameters,
and Inverse Gamma distributions for the standard error of the structural shocks.
The estimation results suggest several key differences between the US and the euro area.
First, consistent with the sample period, we find a higher growth rate µz in the euro area than in the US.

probability interval for the posterior distribution.

Given that both economies have similar discount rates, this will result in a higher steady-state real interest
rate in the euro area than in the US. This difference will play an important role later when we assess (i)
the level of the optimal inflation target and (ii) the effects of a lower steady-state real interest rate. Second,
we find generically higher degrees of indexation to past inflation in the US than in the euro area. This will
translate into a higher tolerance for inflation in the US in our subsequent analysis of the optimal inflation
target. This is because a higher indexation helps to mitigate the distortions induced by a higher inflation
target. Everything else equal, we thus expect a higher optimal inflation target in the US than in the euro
area. Third, we obtain broadly similar parameters for the shocks processes. One exception, though, is the
so-called risk-premium shock. The unconditional variance of the US shock is somewhat higher than its
euro area counterpart.
For the US, most of our estimated parameters are in line with the calibration adopted by Coibion et al.
(2012), with important qualifications. First, we obtain a slightly higher degree of price rigidity than theirs
(0.67 versus 0.55). Second, our specification of monetary policy is different from theirs. In particular, they
allow for two lags of the nominal interest rate in the monetary policy rule while we only have one lag.
However, we can compare the overall degree of interest rate smoothing in the two setups. To this end,
abstracting from the other elements of the rule, we simply focus on the sum of autoregressive coefficients.
It amounts to 0.92 in their calibration while the degree of smoothing in our setup has a mean posterior value
of 0.85. While this might not seem to be a striking difference, it is useful to cast these figures in terms of
half-life of convergence in the context of autoregressive model of order 1. Our value implies twice as small
13

a half-life than theirs. Third, our monetary policy shock and our shocks to demand have approximately
twice as small an unconditional standard deviation as theirs.

3

The Optimal Inflation Target

A second-order approximation of the household expected utility derived from the structural model is used
to quantify welfare, in a similar manner as in Woodford (2003).6 Let W (π; θ ) denote this welfare criterion. This notation emphasizes that welfare depends on the inflation target π together with the rest of the
structural parameters θ. Two cases are considered concerning the latter. In the baseline case the structural
parameters θ are fixed at reference values and taken to be known with certainty by the policy maker. In
an alternative exercise, the policy maker maximizes welfare while recognizing the uncertainty associated
with the model’s parameters.

3.1

Baseline

The optimal inflation target associated with a given vector of parameters θ, π ? (θ ) is approximated via
numerical simulations of the model allowing for an occasionally binding ZLB constraint, using the algorithm outlined above.

7

The optimal inflation rate associated to a particular vector of parameters θ is then

obtained as the one maximizing the welfare function, that is:
π ? (θ ) ≡ arg max W (π; θ ).
π

For illustrative purpose, figures 1a and 1b display the welfare function for the US and the euro area
– expressed as losses relative to the maximum social welfare – associated with three natural benchmarks
for the parameter vector θ: the posterior mean (dark blue line), the median (light blue line), and the mode
(lighter blue line). For convenience, the peak of each welfare function is identified with a dot of the same
color. Also, to facilitate interpretations, the inflation targets are expressed in annualized percentage rates.
As Figure 1a illustrates, the US optimal inflation target is close to 2% and varies between 1.85% and
2.21% depending on which indicator of central tendency (mean, mode, or median) is selected. This range of
values is consistent with the ones of Coibion et al. (2012) even though in the present paper it is derived from
an estimated model over a much shorter sample.8 Importantly, the high degree of interest rate smoothing

precisely, a sample of size T = 100000 of innovations {et }tT=1 is drawn from a Gaussian distribution (we also allow for a

7 More

burn in sample of 200 points that we later discard). We use these shocks to simulate the model for given parameter vector θ. The
welfare function W (π; θ ) is approximated by replacing expectations with sample averages. The procedure is repeated for each of
K = 51 inflation targets on the grid {π (k) }kK=1 ranging from π = 0.5/4% to π = 5/4% (expressed in quarterly rates). Importantly,
we use the exact same sequence of shocks {et }tT=1 in each and every simulation over the inflation grid.
8 Coibion et al. (2012) calibrate their model on a post-WWII, pre-Great Recession US sample. By contrast, we use a Great
Moderation sample.

obtained in Coibion et al. (2012) largely compensates for their larger shocks. In the euro area, as figure 1b
reports, the optimal inflation target is close to 1.5% and varies between 1.31% and 1.58%. Altogether, these
numbers seem roughly consistent with the quantitative inflation targets adopted by the Fed and the ECB,
respectively.
To complement on these illustrative results, figures 2a and 2b display the probability of reaching the
ZLB as a function of the annualized inflation target (again, with the parameter vector θ evaluated at the
posterior mean, median, and mode). For convenience, the circles in each curve mark the corresponding
optimal inflation target.
The probabilities of reaching the ZLB are relatively low, at about 6% for the US and about 10% for the
euro area. This result, as anticipated above, is the mere reflection of our choice of a Great Moderation
sample.

3.2

Accounting for Parameter Uncertainty

An interesting feature of the welfare functions reported in figures 1a and 1b is that they are strongly asymmetric: adopting an inflation target 1 percentage point below the optimal value generates welfare losses
larger than setting it 1 percentage point above. Moreover, as 1a and 1b suggest, the location of the loss
function also depends on the parameter considered. This is important since the exact values of θ and π ? (θ )
are subject to uncertainty. As a result, a policy maker that seeks to maximize expected welfare while recognizing the uncertainty surrounding θ will tend to choose a relatively higher inflation target compared to

the case where θ is taken to be known with certainty, as in the baseline analysis above.
Formally, the estimated posterior distribution of parameters p(θ | XT ) can be exploited to quantify the
impact of such parameter uncertainty on the optimal inflation target and to compute a "Bayesian-theoretic
optimal inflation target". We define the latter as the inflation target π ?? which maximizes the expected
welfare not only over the realizations of shocks but also over the realizations of parameters9
π ?? ≡ arg max

W (π; θ ) p(θ | XT )dθ.

We interpret the spread between the inflation target at the posterior mean θ̄ and the Bayesian inflation target
as a measure of how uncertainty about the parameter value could be conducive to a larger inflation buffer
to hedge against particularly detrimental parameter values (either because they lead to more frequent ZLB
episodes or because they lead to particularly acute inflation distortions). We define
Spr(θ ) ≡ π ?? − π ? (θ )
9 This

Bayesian inflation target is recovered from simulating the model under a ZLB constraint using the exact same sequence

of shocks {et }tT=1 with T = 100000 as in the previous subsection (together with the same burn-in sample) and combining it with
N draws of parameters {θ j } N
j=1 from the estimated posterior distribution p ( θ | XT ), with N = 500. As in the previous section,
the social welfare function W (π; θ ) is evaluated for each draw of θ over a grid inflation targets {π (k) }kK=1 . The Bayesian welfare
criterion is then computed as the average welfare across parameter draws. Here, we start with the same inflation grid as before
and then run several passes. In the first pass, we identify the inflation target maximizing the Bayesian welfare criterion. We then
set a finer grid of K = 51 inflation targets around this value. We repeat this process several times with successively finer grids
of inflation targets until the identified optimal inflation target proves insensitive to the grid. In this particular exercise, some
parameter draws for θ lead to convergence failure in the algorithm implementing the ZLB. These draws are discarded.

16

and assess below Spr(θ̄ ).
According to the simulation exercise, π ?? = 2.40% for the US and π ?? = 2.20% for the euro area.
In both cases, these robust optimal inflation targets are larger than the values obtained with θ set at its
central tendency. As expected, a Bayesian policy maker choose a higher inflation target to hedge against
particularly harmful states of the world (i.e., parameter draws) where the frequency of hitting the ZLB
is high. Noticeably, this inflation cushion is substantially higher in the euro area where Spr(θ̄ ) = 0.62%,
while in the US, Spr(θ̄ ) = 0.19%. This occurs in spite of the optimal inflation target being lower in the euro
area than in the US when evaluated at the posterior mean of the parameter vector θ̄.10

4

The Optimal Inflation Target and the Steady State Real Interest Rate

The focus of this section is to investigate how the monetary authority should adjust its optimal inflation
target π ? in response to changes in the steady-state real interest rate, r ? . Intuitively, with a lower r ? the
ZLB is bound to bind more often, so one would expect a higher inflation target should be desirable in
that case. But the answer to the practical question of by how much should the target be increased is not
obvious. Indeed, the benefit of providing a better hedge against hitting the ZLB, which is an infrequent
event, comes at a cost of higher steady-state inflation which induces permanent costs, as argued by, e.g.,
Bernanke (2016).
To start with, we compute the relation linking the optimal inflation target to the steady-state real interest
rate, based on simulations of the model and ignoring parameter uncertainty. We show that the link between
π ? and r ? depends to some extent on the reason underlying a variation in r ? , i.e. a change in the discount
rate ρ or a change in growth rate of technology µz . We also investigate the role of parameter uncertainty
and, in particular, uncertainty about r ? , in the determination of the Bayesian-theoretic optimal inflation
target. Finally, we investigate how the relation between the optimal inflation target and the steady-state
real interest rate depends on whether the central bank (i) targets the average of realized inflation rather
than (non-stochastic) steady-state inflation rate, (ii) operates in an economy where the lower bound on the
nominal interest rate is negative or (iii) knows its policy reaction function with certainty.

4.1

The baseline (r ? , π ? ) relation

To characterize the link between r ? and π ? , the following simulation exercise is conducted. The structural
parameter vector θ is fixed at its posterior mean, θ̄, with the exception of µz and ρ. These two parameters
are varied – each in turn, keeping the other parameter, µz or ρ, fixed at its baseline posterior mean value.
For both µz and ρ, we consider values on a grid ranging from 0.4% to 10% in annualized percentage terms.
10 Figures

B.1a and B.1b in Appendix show the posterior distribution of π ? (θ ). It is broadly symmetric in the US and shows

substantial asymmetry in the euro area.

varies with ρ

The model is then simulated for each possible values of µz or ρ and various values of inflation targets π
using the procedure as before.11 The optimal value π ? associated to each value of r ? is obtained as the one
maximizing the welfare criterion W (π; θ ).12
We finally obtain two curves. The first one links the optimal inflation target π ? to the steady-state real
interest rate r ? for various growth rate of technology µz : π ? (r ? (µz )), where the notation r ? (µz ) highlights
that the steady-state real interest rate varies as µz varies. The second one links the optimal inflation target
π ? to the steady-state real interest rate r ? for various discount rates ρ: π ? (r ? (ρ)). Here, the notation r ? (ρ)
highlights that the steady-state real interest rate varies as ρ varies.13
Figures 3a and 3b depict the (r ? , π ? ) relations thus obtained for the US and the euro area, respectively.
The blue dots correspond to the case when the real steady-state interest rate r ? varies with µz . The red dots
correspond to the case when the real steady-state interest rate r ? varies with ρ. For convenience, both the
real interest rate and the associated optimal inflation target are expressed in annualized percentage rates.
The dashed grey lines indicate the benchmark result corresponding to the optimal inflation target at the
posterior mean of the structural parameter distribution. To complement these results, Figures 4a and 4b
11 In

particular, we use the same sequence of shocks {et }tT=1 as used in the computation implemented in the baseline exercises

of Section 3. Here again, we start from the same grid of inflation targets for all the possible values of µz or ρ. Then, for each value
of µz or ρ, we refine the inflation grid over successive passes until the optimal inflation target associated with a particular value
of µz or ρ proves insensitive to the grid.
12 To illustrate the construction of this figure, see Appendix C. There, we show how two particular points of this curve are
derived from the welfare criteria.
13 Figures D.1a, D.1b, D.2a, and D.2b report similar results at the posterior mode and at the posterior median.

Note: the blue dots correspond to the (r ? , π ? ) locus when r ? varies with µz ; the red dots correspond to the (r ? , π ? ) locus when r ?
varies with ρ

show the relation between r ? and the probability of hitting the ZLB, evaluated at the optimal inflation target,
for the US and the euro area, respectively. As before, the blue dots correspond to the case when the real
steady-state interest rate r ? varies with µz . The red dots correspond to the case when the real steady-state
interest rate r ? varies with ρ.14
As expected the relations in 3a and 3b are decreasing. However, the slope varies with the value of r ? .
For both the US and the euro area, the slope is relatively large in absolute value – although smaller than
one – for moderate values of r ? (say below 4 percent). The slope declines in absolute value as r ? increases:
Lowering the inflation target to compensate for an increase in r ? becomes less and less desirable. This
reflects the fact that, as r ? increases, the probability of hitting the ZLB becomes smaller and smaller. For
very large r ? values, the probability becomes almost zero, as Figures 4a and 4b show.
At some point, the optimal inflation target becomes insensitive to changes in r ? when the latter originate
from changes in the discount rate ρ. In this case, the inflation target stabilizes at a slightly negative value,
in order to lower the nominal wage inflation rate required to support positive productivity growth, given
the imperfect indexation of nominal wages to productivity. At the steady state, the real wage must grow
at a rate of µz . It is optimal to obtain this steady-state growth as the result of a moderate nominal wage
increase and a moderate price decrease, rather than the result of a zero price inflation and a consequently
larger nominal wage inflation.
14 Figures

15

E.1a and E.1b in Appendix show the relation between r ? and the nominal interest rate when the inflation target is set

at its optimal value.
15 For very large r ? , as a rough approximation, we can ignore the effects of shocks and assume that the ZLB is a zero-mass

19

The previous tension is even more apparent when r ? varies with µz since, in this case, the effects of
imperfect indexation of wages to productivity are magnified given that a higher µz calls for a higher growth
in the real wage, which is optimally attained through greater price deflation, as well as a higher wage
inflation. Notice however that even in this case, the optimal inflation target becomes little sensitive to
changes in r ? for very large values of r ? , typically above 6%, both in the US and the euro area.
For low values of r ∗ , on the other hand, the slope of the curve is steeper. In particular, in the empirically
relevant region, the relation is not far from one-to-one. More precisely, it shows that, starting from the
posterior mean estimate of θ, a 100 basis points decline in r ? should lead to a +99 basis points increase in
π ? in the US and to a +81 basis points increase in the euro area. Importantly, this increase in the optimal
inflation target is the same no matter the underlying factor causing the change in r ? : a drop in potential
growth, µz , or a decrease in the discount factor, ρ. At the same time, the probability of ZLB evaluated at the
optimal inflation rate also increases when the real rate decreases. In the US case, at some point, the speed
at which this probability increases slows down, reflecting that the social planner would choose to increase
the inflation target to almost compensate for the higher incidence of ZLB episodes. By contrast, in the euro
area, the incidence of ZLB seems to increase substantially after a decline in the real interest rate, even at
low values of the latter.
To gain insight into this striking difference, Figures 5a and 5b show how the probability of ZLB changes
as a function of r ? , holding the inflation target constant. We first set the inflation target at its optimal
baseline value (i.e., the value computed at the posterior mean, 2.21 for the US and 1.58 for the euro area).
This is reported below as the blue dots. Similarly, we also compute an analog relation assuming this time
that the inflation target is held constant at the optimal value consistent with a steady-state real interest rate
one percentage point lower (thus, inflation is set to 3.20 for the US and 2.39 for the euro area). Here again,
the other parameters are set at their posterior mean. This corresponds to the red dots in the figure.
Consider first the blue line. At the level of the real interest rate prevailing before the permanent decline,
assuming that the Central Bank sets its target to the associated optimal level, the probability of reaching
the ZLB would be slightly below 6% in the US and close to 9% in the euro area. Imagine now that the real
interest rates experiences a decline of 100 basis points. Keeping the inflation target at the same level as
prior to the shock, the probability of reaching the ZLB would now climb up to approximately 11% in the
US and 16% in the euro area. However, the change in the optimal inflation target brings the probability of
reaching the ZLB back to approximately 6% in the US and 11% in the euro area. In the euro area, the social
planner is willing to tolerate a smaller inflation target than the one that would fully neutralize the effects of
event. Assuming also a negligible difference between steady-state and efficient outputs and letting λ p and λw denote the weights
attached to price dispersion and wage dispersion, respectively, in the approximated welfare function, the optimal inflation obeys
π ? ≈ −λw (1 − γz )(1 − γw )/[λ p (1 − γ p )2 + λw (1 − γw )2 ]µz . Given the low values of λw resulting from our estimation, it is not
surprising that π ? is negative but close to zero. See Amano et al. (2009) for a similar point in the context of a model abstracting
from ZLB issues.

the natural rate decline on the probability of hitting the ZLB. By way of contrast, the social planner in the
US would almost neutralize this effect. In this sense, the US economy has a greater tolerance for steadystate inflation than the euro area. This is in part a consequence of the different estimates for the degree of
indexation of prices to past inflation found at the estimation stage.

4.2

Accounting for Parameter Uncertainty

Next we investigate the impact of parameter uncertainty on the relation between the optimal inflation
target and the steady-state real interest rate. Specifically, we want to determine how the Bayesian-theoretic
optimal inflation target π ?? reacts to a downward shift in the distribution of the steady-state real interest
rate r ? .
Assessing how such a change affects π ?? for every value of r ? is not possible due to the computational
cost involved. Such a reaction is thus investigated for a particular scenario: it is assumed that the economy
starts from the posterior distribution of parameters p(θ | XT ) and that, everything else being constant, the
mean of r ? decreases by 100 basis points. Such a 1 percentage point decline is chosen mainly for illustrative
purposes. Yet, it is of a comparable order of magnitude, although relatively smaller in absolute value,
as recent estimates of the drop of the natural rate after the crisis such as Laubach and Williams (2016)
and Holston et al. (2017). The counterfactual exercise considered can therefore be seen as a relatively
conservative characterization of the shift in steady-state real interest rate. Figures 6a and 6b depict the
counterfactual shift in the distribution of r ? that is considered for, respectively, the US and the euro area.

The Bayesian-theoretic optimal inflation target corresponding to the counterfactual lower distribution
of r ? is obtained from a simulation exercise that relies on the same procedure as before.16 Given a draw in
the posterior of parameter vector θ, the value of the steady-state real interest rate is computed using the
expression implied by the postulated structural model r ? (θ ) = ρ(θ ) + µz (θ ). From this particular draw,
a counterfactual lower steady-state real interest rate, r ? (θ∆ ), is obtained by shifting the long-run growth
component of the model µz downwards by 1 percentage point (in annualised terms). The welfare function
W (π; θ∆ ) is then evaluated. Since there are no other changes than this shift in the mean value of µz in the
distribution of the structural parameters, we can characterize the counterfactual distribution p(θ∆ | XT ) as
a simple transformation of the estimated posterior p(θ | XT ). The counterfactual Bayesian-theoretic optimal
inflation target is then obtained as
π∆?? ≡ arg max
π

Z
θ∆

W (π; θ∆ ) p(θ∆ | XT )dθ∆ .

Figures 7a and 7b illustrate the counterfactual change in optimal inflation target obtained when the
steady-state real interest rate declines by 100 basis points and its new value stays uncertain. For the US,
the simulation exercise returns a value of π∆?? = 3.30% i.e. 90 basis points higher than the optimal value
under uncertainty obtained with the posterior distribution of parameters obtained on a pre-crisis sample
π∆?? = 2.40%. For the euro area, π∆?? = 3.10%, also 90 basis points higher than the optimal value π∆?? =
2.20% obtained with the baseline posterior distribution of parameters.17
16 Again,

we use the same sequence of shocks and the same parameter draws as in section 3.
F.1a and F.1b in Appendix show how the posterior distribution of π ? is shifted after the permanent decline in the

Thus, we see that a monetary authority that is concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the parameters driving the costs and benefits of the inflation target raises the optimal inflation target but does not
alter the reaction of this optimal inflation target following a drop in r ? : in both cases, a 100 basis points decrease in the steady-state real interest rate calls for a roughly 90 basis point increase in the optimal inflation
target in the vicinity of pre-crisis parameter estimates.

4.3

Further Experiments

In the present section we carry out four additional exercises related to the optimal adjustment of the inflation target in response to a change in the steady-state real interest rate. The first three exercises examine
the implications of three alternative assumption regarding monetary policy. The fourth exercise looks at
the case of large shocks.

Average vs Target Inflation

As emphasized in recent works (see, notably, Hills et al. 2016, Kiley and

Roberts 2017), when the probability of hitting the ZLB is non-negligible, realized inflation is on average
significantly lower than the inflation rate that the central bank targets in the interest rate rule (and which
would correspond to steady-state inflation in the absence of shocks). This results from the fact that anytime
the ZLB is binding (which happens recurrently) the central bank effectively loses its ability to stabilize
inflation around the target. Knowing this, the central banks may want to define (and communicate) its
target in terms of the effective average realized inflation. In this section, we investigate whether such an
adjustment in the communication policy is warranted when the inflation target is chosen optimally.

To this end, the analysis of the (r ? , π ? ) relation of section 4.1 is complemented here with the analysis
of the relation between r ? and the average realized inflation rate E{πt } obtained when simulating the
model for various values of r ? and the associated optimal inflation target π ? . In the interest of brevity, the
calculations are undertaken assuming that changes in average productivity growth µz is the only source of
variation in the natural interest rate.
Figures 8a and 8b illustrate the difference between the (r ? , π ? ) curve (blue dots) and the (r ? , E{πt })
curve (red dots) for the US and the euro area. The overall shape of the curve is unchanged. Unsurprisingly,
both curves are identical when r ? is high enough. In this case, the ZLB is (almost) not binding and average
realized inflation does not differ much from π ? . A spread between the two emerges for very low values of
r ? . There, for low values of the natural rate, the ZLB incidence is higher and, as a result, average realized
inflation becomes indeed lower than the optimal inflation target. However, that spread remains limited,
less than 10 basis points. The reason is that the implied optimal inflation target is sufficiently high to
prevent the ZLB from binding too frequently, thus limiting the extent to which average realized inflation
and π ? can differ.
Unreported simulation results show that the gap between π ? and average realized inflation becomes
more substantial when the inflation target is below its optimal value. For instance, mean inflation is
roughly zero when the central bank adopts a 1% inflation target in an economy where the optimal inflation
target is π ? = 2%.

A Negative Effective Lower Bound

The recent experience of many advanced economies (including the

euro area) points to an effective lower bound (ELB) for the nominal interest rate below zero. For instance,

the ECB’s deposit facility rate, which gears the overnight money market rate because of excess liquidity,
was set at a negative value of −10 basis points in June 2014 and has been further lowered down to −40
basis points in March 2016.
We use the estimated euro-area model to evaluate the implications of a negative ELB. More precisely,
we set the lower bound on the nominal rate it so that
it ≥ e
and we set e to −40 basis points (in annual terms) instead of zero. Results are presented in Figure 9. As
expected, the (r ? , π ? ) locus is shifted downwards, though by somewhat less than 40 basis points. Importantly, its slope remains identical to the baseline case: a 100 basis points downward shift in the distribution
of r ? calls for a 90 basis points increase in π ? .

A Known Reaction Function Here we study the consequences of the (plausible) assumption that the
central bank actually knows the coefficients of its interest rate rule with certainty. More specifically we
repeat the same simulation exercise as in subsection 4.2 but with parameters aπ , ay and ρi in the reaction
function 3 taken to be known with certainty. In practice we fix these three parameters at their posterior
mean, instead of sampling them from their posterior distribution. This is arguably the relevant approach
from the point of view of the policymaker.18 Note, however, that all the other parameters are subject to
uncertainty from the stand-point of the central bank.
18 In

practice, long-run inflation targets are seldom reconsidered while the rotation in monetary policy committees happens at a

higher frequency. From this viewpoint, our baseline assumption of uncertainty on all the monetary policy rule parameters is not
necessarily unwarranted.

Figures 10a and 10b present, respectively for the US and the euro area, the Bayesian-theoretic optimal
inflation targets obtained when simulating the model at the initial posteriors and after a -100 basis points
level shift in the posterior distribution of the long-run growth rate µz and, hence, the steady-state real
rate r ? . According to these simulations, the inflation target should initially be π ?? = 2.24% in the US and
π ?? = 2.36% in the euro area. After the counterfactual change in the distribution of r ? considered, π ??
should be increased to 3.16% in the US and to 3.28% in the euro area, again in the ballpark of a 90 basis
points increase in π ? to compensate for the higher probability to hit the ZLB induced by a 100 basis points
downward shift in the distribution of r ? .

What if shocks are larger?

As argued before, the model is estimated using data from the Great Mod-

eration period. One may legitimately argue that the decline in the real interest rate resulting from the
secular stagnation has come hand in hand with larger shocks, as the Great Recession suggests. To address
this concern, we simulate the model assuming that demand shocks have a 30% larger standard error as
estimated.
We conduct this exercise assuming that changes in average productivity growth µz are the only driver
of changes in the natural rate. Apart from σq and σg , which are re-scaled, all the other parameters are
frozen at their posterior mean. Given this setup, the optimal inflation target is 3.7% in the US and 2.7%
in the euro area, as opposed to 2.21% and 1.58% in the baseline, respectively. Also, under the alternative
shock configuration, the probability of hitting the ZLB is 5.3% in the US and 10.1% in the euro, as opposed
to 5.5% and 9.4% in the baseline, respectively.

The red dots correspond to the counterfactual simulation with σq and σg set to twice their baseline value.

Figures 11a and 11b report the (r ? , π ? ) relation under larger demand shocks (red dots) and compares the
outcome with what obtained in the baseline (blues dots).19 Interestingly, the (r ? , π ? ) locus has essentially
the same slope in the low r ? region. Here again, we find a slope close to -0.9. However, the curve is
somewhat steeper in the high r ? region and shifted up, compared to the baseline scenario. This reflects that
under larger demand shocks, even at very high levels of the natural rate, a drop in the latter is conducive
to more frequent ZLB episodes. The social planner is then willing to increase the inflation target at a higher
pace than in the baseline scenario and generically sets the inflation target at higher levels to hedge the
economy against ZLB episodes.

Summary and conclusion

In this paper, we assessed how changes in the steady-state natural interest rate translate into changes in
the optimal inflation target in a model subject to the ZLB. Our main finding is that, starting from pre-crisis
values, a 1% decline in the natural rate should be accommodated by an increase in the optimal inflation
target of about 0.9%. For convenience, Table 3 recaps our results. Overall, across the different concepts of
optimal inflation considered in this paper, the level of optimal inflation does vary. However it is a very
robust finding that the slope of the (r ? , π ? ) relation is close to -0.9 in the vicinity of the pre-crisis value of
steady-state real interest rates both in the US and in the euro-area.
19 We obtain this figure using the same procedure as outlined before.

In our analysis, we considered adjusting the inflation target as the only option at the policymaker’s disposal. This is not to say that this is the only option in their choice set. As a matter of fact, recent discussions
revolving around monetary policy in the new normal have suggested that the various non-conventional
measures used in the aftermath of the Great Recession could feature permanently in policy toolbox. In particular, unconventional monetary policies could represent useful second-best instruments when the ZLB
is reached, as advocated by Reifschneider (2016). An alternative would consist in a change of monetary
policy strategies, e.g., adopting a price-level targeting strategy as recently advocated by Williams (2016).
Beyond monetary policy measures, fiscal policies could also play a significant role, as emphasized by Correia et al. (2013). As a result, the ZLB might be less stringent a constraint in a practical policy context than
in our analysis. However, the efficacy and the costs of these policies should also be part of the analysis.
The complete comparison of these policy trade-offs goes beyond the scope of the present paper.
We have discussed the impact of higher inflation target, abstracting from the transition to a higher
inflation target. In the current lowflation environment, increasing the inflation target in reaction to a drop
in the steady-state value of the real interest rate might be challenging: because of more frequent ZLB
episodes, the realizations of inflation might be on average below the initial inflation target for some time
and increasing the inflation target therefore would raise some credibility issues.
Finally, our analysis also abstracted from forces identified in the literature as warranting a small, positive inflation target, irrespective of ZLB issues, as emphasized in Bernanke et al. (1999). The first is
grounded on measurement issues, following the finding from the 1996 Boskin report that the consumer
price index did probably over estimate inflation in the US by over 1 percentage point in the early nineties.

28

The second argument is rooted in downward nominal rigidities. In an economy where there are such
downward rigidities (e.g. in nominal wages) a positive inflation rate can help "grease the wheel" of the labor market by facilitating relative price adjustments. Symmetrically, we also abstracted from forces calling
for lower inflation targets. The most obvious is the so-called Friedman (1969) rule, according to which average inflation should equal to minus the steady state real interest rate, hence be negative, in order to minimize
loss of resources or utility and the distortionary wedge between cash and credit goods (e.g. consumption
and leisure) induced by a non-zero nominal interest rate. We conjecture that adding these elements to our
setup would leave our main conclusions unchanged. A complete assessment is left for future research.

where Πt ≡ Pt /Pt−1 represents the (gross) inflation rate, and
We induce stationarity by normalizing trending variables by the level of technical progress. To this end,
we use the subscript z to refer to a normalized variable. For example, we define
Cz,t ≡

Ct

Zt

Λz,t ≡ Λt Zt ,

where it is recalled that
Zt = ezt

zt = µz + zt−1 + ζ z,t .

ĝt + βηEt {ĉt+1 } − (1 + βη 2 )ĉt + η ĉt−1 − η (ζ z,t − βEt {ζ z,t+1 }) = ϕ−1 λ̂t

(G.5)

where we defined
ϕ−1 ≡ (1 − βη )(1 − η ),

ĝt = (1 − η )(ζ c,t − βηEt {ζ c,t+1 }).
Similarly, log-linearizing equation (G.4) yields

Natural Rate of Output

The natural rate of output is the level of production that would prevail in an economy without nominal
rigidities, i.e. α p = αw = 0 and without cost-push shocks (i.e., ζ u,t = 0). Under such circumstances, the
dynamic system simplifies to

n
νn̂nt + ζ h,t = λ̂nz,t + ŵz,t

ĝt + βηEt {ŷnz,t+1 } − (1 + βη 2 )ŷnz,t + η ŷnz,t−1 − η (ζ z,t − βEt {ζ z,t+1 }) = ϕ−1 λ̂nz,t ,
where the superscript n stands for natural.
Combining these equations yields
∗
[ ϕ(1 + βη 2 ) + ω ]ŷnz,t − ϕβηEt {ŷnz,t+1 } − ϕη ŷnz,t−1 = ϕ ĝt − ζ h,t − ϕηζ z,t

inflation rate as an expansion parameter. It follows that we consider the welfare effects of non-zero trend
inflation only up to second order.

Second-Order Approximation of Utility

Consider first the utility derived from consumption. For the sake of notational simplicity, define
U (Cz,t − ηCz,t−1 e−ζ z,t ) = log(Cz,t − ηCz,t−1 e−ζ z,t )
We thus obtain

establish a series of results, on which we draw later on.

Price and Wage Dispersions

We now derive the law of motion of price dispersion. Notice that
∆ p,t = V f { pt ( f ) − p̄t−1 }
Immediate manipulations of the definition of the cross-sectional mean of log-prices yield
p̄t − p̄t−1 = α p γ p [(1 − ι p )π + ι p πt−1 ] + (1 − α p )[ p?t − p̄t−1 ].
Then, the classic variance formula yields
∆ p,t = E f {[ pt ( f ) − p̄t−1 ]2 } − [E f { pt ( f ) − p̄t−1 }]2
Using this, we obtain
∆ p,t = α p E f {[ pt−1 ( f ) − p̄t−1 + γ p π̃t−1 ]2 } + (1 − α p )[ p?t − p̄t−1 ]2 − [ p̄t − p̄t−1 ]2
where we defined
π̃t ≡ π + ι p (πt − π )
Notice that

αp
[ p̄t − p̄t−1 − γ p π̃t ]2

Now, notice also that

(H.1)

It then follows that
∆ p,t = α p E f {[ pt−1 ( f ) − p̄t−1 ]2 } +

Hence
∆ p,t = α p ∆ p,t−1 +

The steady-state value of ∆ p is thus

Unless π is itself treated as an expansion variable in the above approximation, we cannot claim that
∆ p,t is second-order.
We now derive the law of motion of wage dispersion. Following similar steps as for price dispersion,
notice that
∆w,t = Vh {wt (h) − w̄t−1 }
Immediate manipulations of the definition of the cross-sectional mean of log-wages yield
w̄t − w̄t−1 = αw (γz µz + γw [(1 − ι w )π + ι w πt−1 ]) + (1 − αw )[wt? − w̄t−1 ].
Then, the classic variance formula yields
∆w,t = Eh {[wt (h) − w̄t−1 ]2 } − [Eh {wt (h) − w̄t−1 }]2
50

(H.2)

Using this, we obtain
∆w,t = αw Eh {[wt−1 (h) − w̄t−1 + γz µz + γw π̃t−1 ]2 } + (1 − αw )[wt? − w̄t−1 ]2 − [w̄t − w̄t−1 ]2
where, this time, we defined
π̃t = π + ι w (πt − π )
Notice that
wt? − w̄t−1 =

Here, treating π as an expansion parameter will not suffice to ensure that wage dispersion ∆w,t is second
order because an additional constant term linked to average productivity shows up in the above equations.
Henceforth, we will assume that µz is an expansion parameter.
Then, if we treat π as an expansion variable, precisely because the steady-state value of ∆ p is of secondorder, many of the expressions previously derived considerably simplify. In particular, we now obtain
pt = p̄t +

wt = w̄t +

1 − θp
∆ p,t + O(||ζ, π ||3 ),

1 − θw
∆w,t + O(||ζ, π ||3 ), ).
2

Now, because ∆y and ∆n are proportional to ∆ p and ∆w , respectively, and because ∆ p and ∆w are both
proportional to π 2 , we also obtain
ñt = Eh {ñt (h)} +

Thus, for sufficiently small inflation rates, we obtain formulas resembling those derived in Woodford
