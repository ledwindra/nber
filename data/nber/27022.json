    "abstract": "\n\nIn the 2000s, US firms have higher valuations than comparable non-US firms listed only outside the US but not non-US firms cross-listed in the US. Though one would expect this US valuation premium to fall over time because of globalization, it widens for firms in developed markets by 36% and falls for firms in emerging markets by 20% after the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. This evolution is explained in part by the decreased valuation of brown firms in other developed countries relative to the US. Other potential explanations are explored and rejected.\n\n",
