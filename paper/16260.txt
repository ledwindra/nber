Exchange Market Pressure and Absorption by International Reserves: Emerging Markets and
Fear of Reserve Loss During the 2008-09 Crisis

September 2010
JEL No. F15,F31,F32,F34,F4
ABSTRACT
This paper evaluates how the global financial crisis emanating from the U.S. was transmitted to emerging
markets. Our focus is on the extent that the crisis caused external market pressures (EMP), and whether
the absorption of the shock was mainly through exchange rate depreciation or the loss of international
reserves. Controlling for variety of factors associated with EMP, we find clear evidence that emerging
markets with higher total foreign liabilities, including short- and long-term debt, equities, FDI and
derivative products—had greater exposure and were much more vulnerable to the financial crisis.
Countries with large balance sheet exposure -- high external portfolio liabilities exceeding international
reserves—absorbed the global shock by allowing greater exchange rate depreciation and comparatively
less reserve loss. Despite the remarkable buildup of international reserves by emerging markets during
the period prior to the financial crisis, countries relied primarily on exchange rate depreciation rather
than reserve loss to absorb most of the exchange market pressure shock. This could reflect a deliberate
choice (“fear of reserve loss” or competitive depreciations) or market actions that caused very rapid
exchange rate adjustment, especially in emerging markets with open capital markets, overwhelming
policy actions.

1. Introduction
International financial markets were at the heart of the world-wide financial crisis
that emerged in late 2007 and reached a climax between August 2008 and February
2009. Although the crisis started with mortgage-related (sub-prime) crisis in the
United States, and was closely linked to banks in Western Europe holding mortgagebacked securities and derivative products, it quickly led to global liquidity crisis that
caused financial market turmoil through the rest of the world.

We focus in this paper on the extent to which the global financial shock adversely
affected the external position of emerging market economies. We measure external
position by looking at changes in exchange market pressure—a combination of
exchange market depreciation and loss of international reserves—as well as
considering these two components separately. We are interesting in two basic
questions: Firstly, how was the transmission of the global shock affected by the extent
of their international balance sheet exposure, financial development and financial
openness?1 Secondly, given the degree of exchange market pressure, what
determines the tradeoff or choice between exchange rate depreciation and loss of
international reserves in absorbing the shock? We sidestep in this paper questions
regarding the root causes of the crisis. These issues are covered by growing literature
dealing with the pre-crisis trends and policies that led to the buildup of financial
vulnerabilities, and ultimately to the crisis in the US and it rapid transition to the
global economy [see Obstfeld (2010), Obstfeld and Rogoff (2010), and the references
therein].

Our main focus in on how the global financial crisis affected emerging market
economies (EMs), where we define emerging market economies according to the
Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets index (see Table 1,

1

See Eichengreen and Hausmann (2005) for studies on the impact of balance sheet exposure on

Financial Instability.

notes for the list of EMs). The focus on emerging markets stems from several
observations. First, these countries were the source of most of the pre-crisis
economic growth, and most of the global population lives there. Second, the process
of globalization rapidly increased the financial and trade linkages of emerging
markets with the OECD countries, relative to the more limited integration of
developing, non emerging market countries. Finally, the OECD countries have had
elastic access to large dollar swap lines extended by the US FED (either directly or
via FED’s large swap line with the ECB). Thereby, the OECD countries were able to
meet excess demand for dollar liquidity by borrowing dollar reserves from the FED,
facilitating the adjustment and deleveraging pressures. In contrast, most emerging
markets were not able to rely on borrowed reserves via swap lines, and were thereby
more exposed to the need to adjust abruptly to the global crisis.

Our results highlight the importance of total external liabilities/GDP ratio
(including debt, equity, FDI and derivative products) in accounting for exchange
market pressures, and the short term external debt/international reserves ratio in
accounting for the higher relative importance of exchange rate depreciation in
accommodating the adjustment to a given degree of exchange market pressure. Our
findings also corroborate that there was a systematic variation in emerging markets
exposure to EMP, and in the ways to accommodate these pressures.

Section 2 overviews the response of emerging and developing economies to the
global financial shock. Section 3 applies multivariate regression analysis, explaining
external vulnerability to financial shocks. Section 4 explains the tradeoff between
reserve loss and exchange rate depreciation, and Section 5 concludes.

2. Response of Emerging and Developing Economies to the Global Financial Shock
Appendix Table A1 presents the change in Exchange Market Pressure (EMP),2
exchange rate depreciation and percentage loss of international reserves during the

See Girton and Roper (1977) and Frankel (2009) for further discussion of exchange market
pressure.

height of the financial crisis, August 2008 – February 2009, and during the worst
phase of the crisis: September –December 2008. The EMP measure is the sum of the
percentage change in the exchange rate (positive values denote percentage
depreciation) and percentage loss of reserves. High values denote greater external
pressure.3 The two components of EMP, percentage change in the exchange rate
(depreciation relative to the USD) and percentage in international reserves.

It is remarkable how extreme and widespread across emerging markets were
external pressures during August 2008 – February 2009, ranging from highs
experienced in Poland (108%) and Russia (89%) to negative values (a combination of
a net appreciation and gain in international reserves) for countries such as Hong Kong
(SAR), China, Israel, Jordan and Thailand. With the exception of Venezuela, all the
emerging markets with positive EMP experienced substantial depreciation of their
currencies against the USD during August 2008 – February 2009. Table A1 also
shows the considerable heterogeneity in their response. Poland depreciated the most,
79%, while Brazil, Korea, Mexico and Russia depreciation by about 50%. Reserves
loss were more moderate, led by Russia, Poland and Malaysia (losing 37%, 28% and
27%, respectively), followed by Venezuela, Morocco, India and Korea (23%, 21%,
19% and 19%, respectively).

To put this into broader perspective, the average EMP for the full sample of all
countries (independently of their income levels) was about 30%. Emerging markets
and low income countries had average EMP of about 35%, while middle and high
income countries had lower EMP rates at 28% and 32%, respectively. Emerging
markets differ most from other country groups in the composition of exchange
rate/reserve loss—emerging markets absorbed much less of the EMP by losing
reserves (and experienced corresponding greater exchange rate depreciation).
3

A second EMP measure is the sum of the percentage change in the exchange rate and loss of
international reserves as a percentage of the monetary base. This measure focuses on the
potential monetary effects of reserve losses during the financial crisis. This measure gave an
almost identical ranking of external market pressure and is not reported for brevity.

Specifically, the ratio of reserve loss to exchange rate depreciation is 0.32 while low
income countries, with a similar EMP to emerging markets, had a ratio of 0.73. The
ratio for the full sample is 0.45.

The financial crisis also hit all regions of the world, though the greatest effect was
felt in Eastern Europe/Central Asia (50% EMP). This is not surprising given that the
sub-prime crisis emanated from the U.S. was directly linked to financial institutions
in Western Europe, and Western Europe in turn was tightly linked through banking
ties with the more fragile economies of Eastern Europe. By contrast, Africa/Middle
East fared best as a region with the lowest EMP, with an average of only 20%,
followed closely by Latin America with 23% EMP.

Panel studies of EMP frequently normalize the exchange rate depreciation rate
and reserve loss rate, focusing on the deviations from their means, normalized by the
standard deviation of the relevant series (see Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2005)).
As our focus is on a cross country comparison during an unprecedented global crisis,
we refrain from such normalizations. As a sensitivity analysis, we compare our EMP
measure and the Weighted EMP used at the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (2009).
The correlation between the two measures in highly significant at 0.63.

In summary, the global financial crisis affected countries across the globe in all
regions, income levels and whether or not they had tight restrictions on capital flows.
Exchange market pressure was intense in most countries, mainly absorbed by
exchange rate depreciation but also through substantial losses of international
reserves.

3. Explaining External Vulnerability to Financial Shocks
Multivariate regression analysis of the link between EMP and selected
explanatory variables in emerging markets is reported in Tables 1 and 2. We define
emerging market economies according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International

(MSCI) Emerging Markets index, focusing on emerging markets that experienced
positive EMP and were not the recipients of IMF standby agreements, subject to data
availability [see Tables 1-2, notes for further details]. The dependent variable is the
degree of exchange market pressure (EMP) during the height of the financial crisis,
September 2008 – December 2008 (table 1), and a wider 9-month window from July
2008 through February 2009 (table 2). We are focusing on our two key measures of
financial vulnerability: total external liabilities/GDP and balance sheet exposure
(Short term external debt/IR -1). We also include a host of control variables common
in the empirical literature on currency crises. The control variables are GDP per
capita, measures of trade and financial openness, the extent of capital controls, the use
of swap lines, OECD membership, the rise of the real exchange rate in the years prior
to the crisis (2003-2007), and international reserves/GDP.4 Specific variable
definitions and data sources are provided in the data appendix.

[Tables 1-2 about here: regressions of EMP]

We find that total external liabilities are significantly (at the 1% level) and
positively related to exchange market pressure (EMP) and this result is robust to
every model specification, for both the short and the longer sample period. Larger
external liabilities—including short- and long-term debt, equity, FDI and derivative
products-- made emerging markets more vulnerable to the global financial crisis.

During the peak of the crisis, balance sheet exposure is also positively related to
exchange market pressure, but is not significant at conventional levels. OECD
membership effect is positive and significant, raising the EMP, in line with the
greater exposure of OECD countries to the US crisis. Access to a swap line reduces
the EMP, as it allows meeting deleveraging pressure by borrowing reserves. The
4

These controls include the one used by Frankel and Saravelos (2010) in their study of EMP
incidences during the crisis. Other variables, not reported for brevity, were also used as
control variables but were never significant. In particular, we included inflation rates, interest
rates, monetary independence and alternative measures of capital controls.

other variables investigated—capital account openness, trade openness—were not
statistically significant different from zero. Similar results hold for both the shorter
and the longer crisis window, though the OECD dummy and the access to the swap
lines lose their significance in the longer crisis window.

4. The tradeoff between reserve loss and exchange rate depreciation
We observed that countries differ markedly in their response to the financial crisis
in terms of whether exchange rate depreciation or losses of reserves absorb EMP. Are
there discernable patterns in the loss of international reserves relative to exchange rate
depreciation in emerging markets for a given degree of exchange rate pressure during
the global financial crisis? This is measured as the loss of international reserves as a
percentage of total exchange market pressure. Large values indicate that countries are
absorbing a high percentage of the total shock by selling international reserves.

It is not clear a priori how emerging markets would respond, in terms of using
exchange rates or reserves, in absorbing an EMP shock. It would seem to be related to
balance sheet exposure. If emerging markets have a high degree of short-term
external debt exposure, often denominated in foreign currency, then they may want to
limit exchange rate depreciation that increases the real value of the foreign debt. This
would suggest a positive relationship between balance sheet exposure and Reserve
Loss Relative to EMP. On the other hand, balance sheet exposure by definition means
that short-term external liabilities are not covered by holdings of international
reserves. This makes countries more vulnerable to the global financial shock and less
able to stem the external crisis by using international reserves that are relatively in
short supply. This argues for a negative link between balance sheet exposure and
Reserve Loss Relative to EMP.

Tables 3 and 4 report the multivariate regression analysis of the link between IR
loss rate/EMP and the explanatory variables applied in Tables 1 and 2 during the
height of the financial crisis, September 2008 – December 2008 (table 3), and a wider

9-months window from July 2008 through February 2009 (Table 4). Balance sheet
exposure is significantly (in most cases at 5% level) and negatively associated with
Reserve Loss Relative to EMP. Countries with fewer reserves relative to short-term
external portfolio debt rely more on exchange rate depreciation to absorb the EMP
shock. Limited reserves constrain countries in how they respond to the crisis, as is
consistent with the second hypothesis discussed above.5 By contrast, total external
liabilities, trade openness, capital account liberalization and swap lines are not
statistically significant. The commodity intensity of trade (commodity exports as a
percentage of total exports) is positively associated with Reserve Loss Relative to
EMP and is statistically significant at the 5% level at the peak of the crisis, the last
quarter of 2008. It appears that emerging markets relying more on commodities in
their export trade are more prone to use international reserves, and try to limit
exchange rate depreciation, when faced with the global financial shock.

[Tables 3-4 about here: regressions of IR loss rate/EMP]

Countries with few reserves relative to portfolio debt are much more likely to rely
on exchange rate depreciation than use scare reserves to absorb the global financial
shock. By contrast, the extent of total external liabilities does not enter significantly
(as it did in explaining overall EMP). This finding is an interesting contrast to the
results in Tables 1 and 2, and suggests that the determinants of total vulnerability
(EMP) are distinct from the factors that determine the tradeoff between using reserves
or the exchange rate (Reserve Loss Relative to EMP).

Figures 1 and 2 plot the conditional association between Reserve Loss Relative to
EMP and balance sheet exposure for the two sample periods, showing the strong
negative association between the two variables. This association is more pronounced
5

The economic effect is quite large: a 10 percentage point higher pre-crisis balance sheet
exposure (Sort term Debt in excess of IR) relative to IR, corresponds to up to 3.06 percentage
points (3.87 percentage points) lower fraction of IR loss relative to EMP during the 4-month
(the 9-months) crisis windows, respectively.

during the peak of the crisis, a period when emerging market-commodity exporters
relied more heavily than other EMs on reserves depletion to cushion their adjustment
to EMP.

[Figures 1-2 about here: the association of IR loss rate/EMP and Balance sheet
exposure]
5. Conclusions
We found clear evidence that emerging markets with higher ratio of the total
foreign liabilities/GDP were more vulnerable to the financial crisis. Higher balance
sheet exposure (higher short term foreign debt relative to international reserves) is
significantly associated with greater weight attached to currency depreciation and
lower weight attached to losing international reserves as means of dealing with
exchange market pressure during the crisis. While larger total external liabilities/GDP
are clearly associated with larger EMP, higher ratio of external short term
debt/international reserves is associated with higher weight on price adjustment
(exchange rate depreciation) and lower weight on quantity adjustment (losing
reserves) as a way to accommodate a given EMP. Despite the remarkable buildup of
international reserves by emerging markets during the period prior to the financial
crisis, emerging markets relied primarily on exchange rate depreciation rather than
reserve loss to absorb most of the exchange market pressure shock—“fear of reserve
loss.”

These findings are consistent with the observations in Aizenman and Yi (2010)
regarding emerging markets’ switch during the crisis from the fear of floating [Calvo
and Reinhart (2001)] to the fear of losing reserves during the crisis. While
international reserves/GDP ratios were high in most emerging markets before the
crisis relative to their levels in previous crises, they rarely were high enough to cover
the entire external portfolio liabilities of the affected countries. Thus, countries opted
to rely on exchange rate adjustment, refraining from fast depletion of their

international reserves. The reluctance to rely more on reserves depletion may reflect
several concerns: fear that losing reserves too fast may propagate a run on the
remaining reserves, and uncertainty about crisis duration may suggests keeping
reserves to deal with future market pressure. Furthermore, at times of collapsing
global demand, countries are more willing to engage in competitive depreciation, as
the downside of higher inflation is sharply mitigated by the global recession.
Interestingly, we find that emerging markets relying more on commodities in their
export trade are more prone to use international reserves, and try to limit exchange
rate depreciation, when faced with the global financial shock. This is consistent with
the notion that commodities are priced by the global market, thus commodities
exporters don’t benefit from depreciation, opting instead to use their reserves to
absorb exchange market pressure.

Our results are also in line with Frankel and Saravelos (2010), reporting several
pre-crisis variables accounting for the 2008-09 crisis incidence. Specifically, they
found that higher pre-crisis reserves/GDP and lower pre-crisis real exchange
appreciation were associated with lower exchange market pressure during the crisis.
Yet, our results also suggest the importance of the ratio total external liabilities/GDP
in accounting for higher exchange market pressure during the crisis. Controlling for
this broad exposure measure renders balance sheet exposure insignificant.

Our results corroborate the notion that globally linked national financial markets,
intermediated via foreign currency markets, transmitted globally the 2008-9 financial
crisis. In turbulent times, when the duration of depth of the global crisis remains
unknown, emerging markets behavior has been characterized more by the fear of
losing reserves, and less by the fear of floating. Despite the remarkable buildup of
international reserves by emerging markets during the period prior to the financial
crisis, countries relied primarily on exchange rate depreciation rather than reserve loss
to absorb most of the exchange market pressure shock. This could reflect a deliberate
choice, possibly to gain competitiveness at times of collapsing export demand. It
may also reflect market actions that moved quickly and strongly to adjust to changing

circumstances, especially in emerging markets with open capital markets. The
financial market crisis was followed by a global recession, suggesting that exchange
rate depreciations attempting to improve international competitiveness can be part of
the adjustment of small economies but can’t resolve global collapsing demands. Our
findings also confirm the key importance of balance sheet effects in explaining
vulnerabilities and adjustments. Countries with higher total foreign liabilities/GDP
were more vulnerable to the financial crisis. Countries with larger balance sheet
exposure — higher external portfolio liabilities exceeding international reserves —
responded to the global shock by allowing greater exchange rate depreciation and
comparatively less reserve loss.

We define emerging market economies according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets index. The index includes 26 countries: Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia,
South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela. We exclude Hungary because it received its first substantial IMF disbursement of approximately $6.4 billion during our
sample period significant affecting its foreign exchange reserve position and potentially the level of exchange rate depreciation. We also exclude Taiwan due to insufficient data.
We construct our sample from the remaining emerging market economies which experienced positive EMP: 18 during the 4-month time window and 20 during the 9-months
window. These are: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia,
South Africa, Turkey and Venezuela.

Notes: Robust t statistics in parentheses; *, **, *** indicate variables significant at 10%, 5%, and 1% respectively. All independent variables as of 2007, except
for Swap Lines which indicate countries that received and used a swap line during the crisis period. Sample restricted to emerging markets that experience
positive EMP.
We define emerging market economies according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets index. The index includes 26 countries: Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia,
South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela. We exclude Hungary because it received its first substantial IMF disbursement of approximately $6.4 billion during our
sample period significant affecting its foreign exchange reserve position and potentially the level of exchange rate depreciation. We also exclude Taiwan due to insufficient data.
We construct our sample from the remaining emerging market economies which experienced positive EMP: 18 during the 4-month time window and 20 during the 9-months
window. These are: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia,
South Africa, Turkey and Venezuela.
