    "abstract": "\n\nIn this essay, I analyze Salvador Allende\u2019s economic policies in Chile during the early 1970s. I argue that the explosion of inflation during his administration (above 1,500% on a six-month annualized measure) was predictable, and that the government\u2019s response to it, through massive and strict price controls, generated acute macroeconomic imbalances. I postulate that the combination of runaway inflation, shortages, and black markets generated major disaffection among the middle class and that that unhappiness reduced the support for the Unidad Popular government.\n\n",
