ABSTRACT
In order to better understand what threatens vulnerable populations’ access to primary care, it is important
to understand the factors associated with closing safety-net clinics. This paper examines how a clinic’s
financial position, productivity, and community characteristics are associated with its risk of closure.
We examine patterns of closures among private-run primary care clinics (PCCs) in California between
2006 and 2012. We use a discrete-time proportional hazard model to assess relative hazard ratios of
covariates, and a random-effect hazard model to adjust for unobserved heterogeneity among PCCs.
We find that lower net income from patient care, smaller amount of government grants, and lower
productivity were associated with significantly higher risk of PCC closure. We also find that federally
qualified health centers (FQHCs) and non-FQHCs generally faced the same risk factors of closure.
These results underscore the critical role of financial incentives in the long-term viability of safety-net
clinics.

INTRODUCTION
Millions of low-income and uninsured Americans who lack access to private physician
practices rely on the healthcare safety net. Safety-net providers— consisting of publicly and
privately supported hospitals, community health centers, local health departments, and other
providers that care for a disproportionate share of vulnerable populations— form a vital
component of America’s healthcare system. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
estimates that community health centers alone encounter 31 million visits annually, the majority
made by patients who are publicly insured or uninsured. (Hing & Hooker, 2011)
Despite a well-documented growth of safety-net primary care clinics in recent years,
there is little understanding about how well these clinics have survived the constant threats from
increasingly difficult financial conditions. Given that low-income and uninsured people have
difficulty accessing healthcare elsewhere (Andersen et al., 2002), closures of safety-net primary
care clinics may lead to poorer health outcomes in vulnerable populations. Researchers find that
Medicaid and uninsured patients have to travel significantly further for care when a safety-net
clinic closes (Bazzoli, Lee, Hsieh, & Mobley, 2012), and that longer travel distance can reduce
healthcare utilization, especially in rural areas (Gresenz, Rogowski, & Escarce, 2007).
While the federal government has invested additional funding to expand certain types of
safety-net clinics under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), there is a widespread concern that many
others will continue to operate in a volatile environment with declining funding support in their
states. (Adashi, Geiger, & Fine, 2010) Opinion surveys reveal that safety-net clinics are deeply
concerned about the threats of financial instability, limited capacity, and difficulty in recruiting
and retaining staff. (Lewin & Baxter, 2007) However, little is known about the extent to which
such economic factors contribute to actual closures of safety-net clinics.

3

In this study, we fill this gap by assessing how variations in clinic and community
characteristics influence clinic closures. We employ data on private safety-net clinics in
California between 2006 and 2012, a period during which the state saw dramatic growth in the
uninsured population (Lavarreda, Snyder, & Brown, 2013) and cuts in funding of state and local
health departments (Willard, Shah, Leep, & Ku, 2012) as a result of the 2009 economic crisis.
Therefore, the study period provides us with an appropriate window to examine the effects of the
healthcare environment on clinic viability.
New Contribution
Despite the numerous case studies documenting the deteriorating financial condition of
many safety-net clinics and concerns about clinic survival under tightened funding policies, there
is little understanding of how clinics respond to financial stress. Moreover, existing literature has
largely been qualitative. Using a recent longitudinal dataset of safety-net clinics in California,
our study addresses this gap by assessing the relationship between economic factors and the risk
of closure in safety-net clinics. We examine variables frequently cited as threats to clinic survival
in previous studies. A better understanding of the influence of these risk factors provide
important insights for policies aimed at providing an adequate and sustained supply of safety-net
clinics in underserved communities.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
Our conceptual framework is based on the economic theory of firm entry and exit, which
predicts that in the long run, a firm would leave the market if it does not generate sufficient
revenue to cover its total expenses (Pakes, Ostrovsky & Berry, 2007). This implies that the
probability of closure for a safety-net clinic in a given period is:
Pr

where

and

represent the clinic’s the expected net income and fixed cost in the next period,

respectively. The clinic’s net income

;

,

has two elements:

is a vector of facility-

level parameters, and is a vector of community-level parameters, including the number of firms
in the market and other exogenous profit shifters captured by vector z. Assuming zero fixed cost
to simplify the model, the survival of clinic depends on its future net income.
We consider a clinic’s past financial status and productivity as key parameters in vector
. In contrast to physician offices that largely rely on income from private payers, safety-net
clinics rely heavily on revenue from Medicaid reimbursement, as well as various sources of
funding from federal, state, and local government (Grogan & Gusmano, 2009). As such, a
clinic’s net income can be written as:

Note that both net patient income and grants can reduce a clinic’s chance of closure, but
the two factors may be correlated, complicating the independent effect of each. Clinics that
provide more uncompensated care, and thus have less net patient income, are likely to receive
more government funding. Comparative statics analysis predicts that conditional on net patient
income, more government funding decreases a clinic’s probability of closure. This forms our
main hypothesis. In addition, we expect that greater clinic productivity, as measured by the
average number of visits per full-time equivalent (FTE), would decrease the risk of closure
because holding everything else constant, an increase in clinic productivity would increase net
income.

5

Variations in the local healthcare environment, as captured by parameters in vector
,

, may also affect safety-net clinics’ viability. A greater number of clinics in a community

may increase competition among clinics for patient volume and grants, leading to more closures.
Similarly, a larger number of physicians in a community could imply lower volume for clinics,
and thus more closures, if physicians and clinics provide substitutable services. In addition,
previous research documents that the closure or downsizing of local hospital ambulatory care
departments may threaten safety-net clinics if a large proportion of uninsured patients are shifted
from those facilities to safety-net clinics (Lewin & Baxter, 2007). Lastly, local demographic
changes that lead to increased demand for uncompensated care, such as a surge in the number of
people without health insurance, can also create financial stress for safety-net clinics (Schwartz
& Artiga, 2007). In sum, we hypothesize that clinics are more likely to close in communities
where there are greater numbers of safety-net clinics, greater numbers of physicians, larger
shares of uninsured population, and where hospitals have relatively smaller ambulatory primary
care capacity.

METHODS
Data on California Primary Care Clinics
Our primary data come from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and
Development (OSHPD) Primary Care Clinics Annual Utilization Data between 2006 and 2012.1
The data contain comprehensive clinic information including a unique identifier, license status
(open/closed), facility location, FQHC status, staffing, patient population characteristics, and
financial information such as operating revenues and expenses.
Licensed under the California Department of Public Health, private safety-net clinics are
known as “primary care clinics” (PCCs), and operate in various forms including Federally
Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), FQHC “look-alikes”, Rural Health Clinics (RHCs), family
6

planning clinics, free clinics, and other types of private nonprofit community clinics (Saviano &
Powers, 2005).2 As of 2012, a total of 1,019 PCCs served 5.2 million people, or about one in
seven Californians. Roughly one-third (36%) of PCCs’ operating revenue comes from federal
and state grants, and the rest comes from patient revenue. Medicaid is the most common PCC
payer source, accounting for 37% of patient revenue.
Outcome Variable and Covariates
We identify closure based on PCC license status in the prior year and the year after: a
PCC shut down in year t if it reported open in year t but not t+1. Using a county identifier, the
PCC dataset was linked with variables of community characteristics, collected from various
sources as detailed below.
At the facility level, net patient income (net patient revenue minus operation expense)
and government grants are used to describe a clinic’s financial status. To account for the fact that
PCCs’ financial reporting period may not match a calendar year and to smooth out the
fluctuation in financial status, we calculate the three-year averages of net patient income and
grants. We include interactions between these two covariates in regressions in order to test the
hypothesis that conditional on net patient income, higher government funding is associated with
lower risk of clinic closure.
Clinic productivity is measured by two variables (Akscin, Barr, & Towle, 2007): the
number of visits per FTE clinician (including physicians, physician assistants, family nurse
practitioners, and other Medicaid billable providers) and the number of visits per FTE staff (such
as registered nurses, unlicensed medical assistants, and administrative staff). In addition,
indicators of rural clinic, FQHC, and free clinic are included.
A variety of community characteristics are used to capture changes in local healthcare
environment and demographics. We use the total number of PCCs per 10,000 county residents to
7

determine the extent to which a county was a competitive market for PCC. To capture the role of
local hospitals’ primary care capacity, we obtain the number of visits to hospital outpatient
departments (ODs) from OSHPD Hospital Annual Financial data3, and calculate the ratio of total
OD visits to PCC visits in a county. In addition, the number of primary care physicians per
10,000 county residents and percent of uninsured population are obtained from the Area Health
Resource Files. We defined primary care physicians as all physicians licensed by the American
Medical Association in family practice and general practice, general internal medicine, and
general pediatrics. (Shi & Starfield, 2001) Finally, annual county population growth and the
percent of Medi-Cal enrollees in population are collected from the California Department of
Public Health. All county-level covariates are assigned with prior-year (t-1) values in order to
address the concern that PCC closures may influence the local healthcare environment
contemporaneously.
Statistical Analysis
To estimate the probability of clinic closure controlling for time-varying covariates, we
employ a discrete-time proportional hazard ratio regression model (Cameron & Trivedi, 2005).
Suppose there are clinics i = 1, …, N, existing in county j at time t=0. The hazard rate clinic i is
defined as the probability of closure in interval t and t+1, given survival to time t (t=0, … 6).
The functional form of the hazard rate is specified as a log-logistic hazard model:
1

,

(1)

where

represents the dependence of the hazard rate on duration, specified as log(t+1), and

vector

is an array of time-varying covariates summarized as above. We estimate the model

using maximum likelihood method, which accommodates for right-censored and left-truncated
data. To account for possible non-linear relationships of covariates and the outcome variable, we

8

represent each covariate by tertile indicators (the lowest tertile being the reference group).
Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are calculated. Standard errors are
adjusted to account for clustering of PCCs within counties.
We further extend model (1) to account for unobserved heterogeneity among clinics by
estimating a random-effect model with a clinic-specific error term
normally distributed with zero mean, uncorrelated with

. We assume that

is

, and estimate the proportion of

variance in closure risk that’s explained by clinic-level heterogeneity. To test the proportional
hazards assumption, we re-estimate the model with interactions between facility-level covariates
and the baseline hazard function. We then perform likelihood-ratio tests to compare models with
and without time-dependent covariates, with the null hypothesis being that all covariates satisfy
the proportional hazard assumption. Finally, about half of the sample was comprised of FQHCs,
which receive additional federal grants as well as enhanced reimbursement from Medicare and
Medicaid. To test whether closure risks varied by FQHC status, we estimate random-effect
model on subsamples of FQHC and non-FQHC clinics. All statistical analyses are performed
using STATA version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).

RESULTS
Our data identify 1,379 unique PCCs in 55 counties in California between 2006 and 2012,
comprising a sample of 6,884 PCC-year observations. Figure 1 shows that the demand for PCCs
spiked in 2009 and continued to grow throughout the study period. While the total number of
PCCs in operation also rose steadily from 845 to 1,084, a total of 300 PCCs closed. Possibly due
to rising demand during the economic downturn, the annual number of PCC closures fell
between 2006 and 2009, but the number started to climb again in later years.

9

Table 1 reports summary statistics and differences between closing versus existing PCCs,
in terms of facility and community characteristics. Compared with non-closure PCCs, those that
closed during the study period were more likely to be rural clinics (0.05 vs. 0.02, p<0.001), and
less likely to be FQHCs (0.41 vs. 0.55, p<0.001) or free clinics (0.03 vs. 0.04, p=0.008). On
average, PCCs relied heavily on government funding, and non-closing PCCs received relatively
more funding to cover larger deficits in net patient income (net patient revenue minus operating
expenses). Comparison of community characteristics indicates that closures were more likely to
occur in counties with more PCCs per capita (0.38 vs. 0.34, p=0.02), with slightly more primary
care physicians (9.51 vs. 9.05, p<0.001), smaller shares of Medi-Cal enrollees (17.69 vs. 18.97,
p<0.001), and greater population growth (57.66 vs. 41.6, p<0.001).
Figure 2 depicts the survival rates of PCCs over time, stratified by key variables of
interest. By the end of 2012, 83% (CI, 0.79-0.86) of PCCs with the lowest clinician productivity
were still in operation, compared with 90% (CI, 0.87-0.93) of PCCs with the highest productivity.
A similar pattern is found when the sample is stratified by staff productivity and by the level of
grant support. By contrast, there were significant overlaps between the survival curves of PCCs
in different tertiles of net patient income. Thus, exploratory analyses reveal that a clinic’s
productivity and government funding support were associated with higher rates of survival.
Table 2 reports the relative hazard ratios of PCC closure based on discrete-time
proportional hazard models. The unit of analysis is an individual PCC in a given year. The
standard model (Column 1) estimates that net income from patient care was associated with
significantly lower risk of closure (RR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14-0.50). Within each tertile of net
patient income, increased amount of government grants was also associated with lower risk of
closure, although such effect cannot be precisely measured for the highest tertile of net patient

10

income group. In addition, PCCs with more visits per FTE clinician (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.500.88) and more visits per FTE staff (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95) were at lower risk of closure.
Overall, these findings are consistent with our hypothesis that poor financial status and lower
productivity lead to greater closure risk of a clinic.
PCCs were more likely to close in communities with greater number of primary care
physicians per capita (RR, 1.44; 95% IC, 1.02-2.04). Other community characteristics, including
the total number of PCCs per capita, hospital OD-PCC visits ratio, share of uninsured population,
share of Medi-Cal enrollees, and population growth rate, had little to no association with the risk
of closure.
The random-effect hazard model (Column 2) retains similar results. If anything, the
estimated effects of independent variables on closure risk are somewhat augmented after
controlling for unobserved facility-level heterogeneity. Specifically, the random-effect model
estimates that the risk of closure was 53-84% lower in clinics with more net patient income, and
17-35% lower in clinics with greater productivity. The

statistic reports that 62% of the total

variance was due to differences across clinics, and likelihood-ratio test rejects the hypothesis that
rho equals zero.
Table 3 shows that the time-dependent hazard rates were constant within strata of
facility-level covariates. At 5% significance level, likelihood-ratio tests fail to reject that the null
hypothesis that all covariates satisfy the proportional hazards assumption.
Results from Table 4 suggest that FQHCs and non-FQHCs generally faced the same risk
factors of closure. Net patient income, government funding, and productivity were important
predictors of closure risk, regardless of a clinic’s FQHC status. There is some evidence that a
greater proportion of patient visits made to hospital ODs relative to PCCs in a county was

11

associated with lower risk of closure among FQHCs, which is consistent with our hypothesis.
But in general, variations in community characteristics were not significantly associated with
variations in closure rates. Facility-level heterogeneity explained 64% of total variance among
FQHCs and 55% of total variance among non-FQHCs.

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
While the nation’s safety net has largely weathered various threats over the last decade,
researchers have consistently documented concerns among safety-net providers regarding their
sustainability in an increasingly challenging operating environment. (Cunningham, Bazzoli, &
Katz, 2008; Jacobson et al., 2005) In this study, we provide evidence that poor financial status
and low productivity put clinics at greater risk of closure; however, local environment
characteristics in general have little correlation with clinic closure. While quantitative studies on
the role of financial performance and clinic closures nationally are lacking, the evidence from
California is in broad agreement with related qualitative studies. For instance, a qualitative study
of FQHCs in 12 nationally representative communities (Katz et al., 2011) documented an
important role of patient revenue and external funding support in FQHC development. In
addition, our findings are consistent with existing evidence on the relationship between financial
stress and safety-net hospital closures (Bazzoli, Lindrooth, Kang, & Hasnain‐Wynia, 2006; Shen,
Hsia, & Kuzma, 2009; Hsia, Kellermann, & Shen, 2011).
Some of our results merit further discussion. The finding that increased government
funding is more strongly associated with a lower risk of closure among clinics with lower patient
revenues suggests that government grants can help individual clinics survive financial hardship
through covering shortfalls in patient revenue. However, the caveat should be made that low-

12

performing clinics (e.g. those with highly excessive capacity) should be allowed to lose grants to
other clinics with growing demand, even if that means an increased risk of closure for them.
Although some researchers suggest that safety-net providers serving communities with
greater needs from uninsured and Medicaid populations are under more stress (Lewin & Baxter,
2007), our analysis did not find a significant relationship between community demographics and
PCC closure risk. On the other hand, the finding that PCCs tend to close in communities where
hospital ODs serve a smaller share of patients implies that shifting the burden of care from other
providers to PCCs in a community may be associated with greater PCC closure risk.
Our findings provide several implications for the health care reform. With the
implementation of Medicaid eligibility expansion and state insurance marketplaces, 3.7 million
previously uninsured Californians are expected to gain insurance coverage (Nardin et al. 2013).
However, the percentage of physicians accepting new Medicaid patients in California is
significantly lower than the national average (Hing, Decker, & Jamoom, 2015), particularly due
to low reimbursement rates (Zuckerman & Goin, 2012). Therefore, safety-net patients are likely
to continue visiting PCCs for convenience and affordability, and the growing demand for PCCs
in California is likely to gain momentum in the coming years (Ku et al, 2011). Our results
suggest that additional economic incentives will be needed to sustain the viability of private
PCCs in order to help meet the growing demand. Noting that the operation of private safety-net
clinics relies heavily on patient revenue, our results further imply that enhanced reimbursement
will be needed to preserve safety-net clinics supply.
To a certain extent, improved financial incentives are built in the ACA through federal
subsidies to new Medicaid and insurance marketplace enrollees. PCCs may also have
temporarily benefited from an ACA provision that increased Medicaid payments for primary

13

care physicians in 2013-2014. However, as of the completion of this analysis, the California state
government does not plan to extend the Medicaid primary care fee increases through 2015. It is
estimated that expiration of temporary rate increase would lead to a 59% decrease in Medicaid
primary care fees in California, the steepest reduction across all states. (Zuckerman, Laura, &
Kristen, 2014) More research will be needed to understand safety-net clinics’ survival strategies
in face of dual pressures from substantial fee cuts and growing demand.
Our analysis has several limitations. First, our dataset of primary care clinics is not a
comprehensive record of safety-net primary care providers in California. Publicly operated
clinics, such as those operated by county and city governments, serve as another important
source of care for underserved populations in California, but are not captured in the data.
Nevertheless, since there is no existing literature on the pattern of safety-net health center
closures, this study provides a helpful first step in determining the extent to which closure is
correlated with frequently cited risk factors.
Second, other aspects of PCC market dynamics, such as openings and mergers, are not
addressed in this analysis. Noting that there has been a net increase in the total number of PCCs
in CA during the study period, further study is warranted to examine whether the net expansion
of PCCs has improved access to care in needy communities. Last, our community characteristics
vary at the county level and thus may not capture small-area heterogeneity correlated with PCC
closings. Future research may include sub-county analyses, for example at the hospital service
area level, to further understand within-market variations in PCC closings.
