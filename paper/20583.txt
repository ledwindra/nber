Housing Collateral, Credit Constraints and Entrepreneurship - Evidence from a Mortgage
Reform

ABSTRACT
We study how a mortgage reform that exogenously increased access to credit had an impact on
entrepreneurship, using individual-level micro data from Denmark. The reform allows us to disentangle
the role of credit access from wealth effects that typically confound analyses of the collateral channel.
We find that a $30,000 increase in credit availability led to a 12 basis point increase in entrepreneurship,
equivalent to a 4% increase in the number of entrepreneurs. New entrants were more likely to start
businesses in sectors where they had no prior experience, and were more likely to fail than those
who did not benefit from the reform. Our results provide evidence that credit constraints do affect
entrepreneurship, but that the overall magnitudes are small. Moreover, the marginal individuals selecting
into entrepreneurship when constraints are relaxed may well be starting businesses that are of lower
quality than the average existing businesses, leading to an increase in churning entry that does not
translate into a sustained increase in the overall level of entrepreneurship.

Introduction

One of the most robust findings in the entrepreneurship literature is the strong positive correlation
between personal wealth and the propensity to engage in entrepreneurship (Evans and Jovanovic,
1989; Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen, 1994; Gentry and Hubbard, 2004). For example, Gentry
and Hubbard (2004) find that entrepreneurs comprise just under 9% of households in the US, but
hold about 40% of total net worth. Several other studies have documented that entrepreneurs are
not just wealthier, but wealthier individuals are also more likely to become entrepreneurs (Hurst
and Lusardi, 2004).
The most common explanation for this correlation is that credit constraints pose an important
barrier to entry for less wealthy individuals (Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981; Evans and Jovanovic, 1989).
Evans and Jovanovic (1989) argue that these constraints are likely to be binding for the most
productive entrepreneurs, suggesting that the returns to relaxing constraints are large. However,
others have questioned the degree to which financing constraints are salient for entrepreneurship,
particularly in advanced economies where firms have adequate access to capital. This work has
argued that a correlation between wealth and entry might exist due to unobserved differences in
productivity, or preferences for entrepreneurship, that are correlated with wealth rather than due to
the presence of credit constraints (Hamilton, 2000; Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2002; Hurst
and Lusardi, 2004; Hurst and Pugsley, 2011) .
A central approach to addressing this debate has been to examine how unexpected changes in
personal wealth impact entrepreneurship. For example, Blanchflower and Oswald (1998), HoltzEakin, Joulfaian and Rosen (1994), and Andersen and Nielsen (2012) have all examined the impact
of bequests on entrepreneurship. More recently, several papers have examined how increases in the
value of home equity due to house price appreciation might impact entrepreneurship via the collateral channel (e.g., Black et al. (1996); Schmalz, Sraer and Thesmar (2014), Harding and Rosenthal
(2013), Fairlie and Krashinsky (2012) and Adelino, Schoar, Severino (2012)). Although this work
finds that an increase in personal wealth leads to entrepreneurship, it is unable to fully isolate the
effect of credit constraints on entrepreneurship, because large increases in wealth, while alleviating
credit constraints can also lead to wealth effects. For example, increases in wealth can change an
individual’s risk aversion (Evans and Jovanovic, 1989; Khilstrom and Laffont, 1979) or preferences
(Hurst and Lusardi, 2004) and hence change their propensity to engage in entrepreneurship independent of credit constraints. Distinguishing between these two underlying factors is important,

1

because a wealth shock may drive entrepreneurship even if credit constraints are not important.
Isolating the impact of credit constraints therefore requires an exogenous change in the financing
environment for entrepreneurs that also does not impact their wealth.
In this paper, we exploit a unique mortgage reform in Denmark coupled with extremely rich
micro data to overcome this inferential challenge. Prior to this reform, individuals could only use
mortgage loans to finance the purchase of their home, and were precluded from using home equity
as collateral for personal loans needed to finance consumption or investment. The reform, that was
passed in 1992, allowed home owners, for the first time, to borrow against the home for purposes
other than financing the home itself – thereby unlocking access to credit without changing their
wealth. In addition, since the amount of housing collateral that was unlocked was a function of
the mortgage they had outstanding at the time of the reform, the degree to which individuals were
able to borrow against their home for other purposes was driven in large part by the timing of
their house purchase relative to the reform. Individuals therefore entered the post-reform period
with a differential increase in credit access based on their outstanding mortgage in 1991. By
exploiting this cross-sectional variation in the intensity of the reform’s treatment across otherwise
equivalent individuals, we are able to isolate the impact of an exogenous increase in access to credit
through the collateral channel and examine how this impacted both entry rates and the survival
of existing businesses. The micro data allow us control for important covariates, as well as to
distinguish between net and gross flows of entrepreneurs, which turns out to be important in our
context. We use this to study whether the overall number of entrepreneurs was affected by the
credit availability as well as whether the reform generated an inflow of new entrepreneurs that had
different performance characteristics relative to those entering before the reform.
We find that the reform unlocked a substantial amount of home equity that could be used
as collateral for personal loans - about $30,000 on average and equivalent to more than a year’s
disposable income for the median treated individual in our sample. Furthermore, we find that many
individuals with access to more home equity did in fact increase their personal debt substantially.
On average, a $1 increase in collateral was associated with a $0.19 increase in personal debt. Yet, we
find that the relative increase in the number of active entrepreneurs was 12 basis points, equivalent
to about a 4% increase in the number of active entrepreneurs before the reform. When looking
at the characteristics of the businesses, we find that existing businesses that were more likely to
survive were marginally weaker, and new entrants had much greater failure rates than the control
group. Even those entrants that survived had lower sales, profits and employment relative to the
2

control group, suggesting that businesses started by the marginal entrant who benefited from the
reform were of lower quality than those started by equivalent individuals who did not get increased
access to housing collateral. Since the reform allowed individuals to access external finance without
mortgage banks having to screen the specific projects of potential entrepreneurs, our latter result
suggests that individuals may have been starting lower quality projects because they didn’t face
the discipline of external finance.
Our findings are relevant to the extensive literature looking at financing constraints and entrepreneurship. A number of models suggest that individuals are either precluded from entry or
that firms enter small and then grow because of the fact that they face financing constraints (Cooley and Quadrini, 2001; Evans and Jovanovic, 1989; Gentry and Hubbard, 2004; Cabral and Mata,
2004; Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian and Rosen, 1994; Cagetti and De Nardi, 2006; Buera, Koboski and
Shin, 2011; Rajan and Zingales, 1998). Others looking at entry into entrepreneurship have found
less support for this view (e.g., Hamilton (2000); Hurst and Lusardi (2004)). We present analyses
based on a research design that is able to cleanly identify the effect of credit without varying wealth
at the same time, as well as separate out entry from survival. Our results provide evidence that
credit constraints do affect entrepreneurship, but that the overall magnitudes are small. In part,
this is due to the fact that new entrants that benefit from a reduced constraint may well be starting
businesses that are of lower quality than the average existing businesses, leading to churning entry
that does not contribute to a equivalent boost in the stock of entrepreneurs.
The rest of the paper is structure as follows: in Section 2, we discuss the literature examining
credit constraints in entrepreneurship and elaborate on the mortgage reform we study. In Section
3, we outline the data used in the analyses. Section 4 discusses our results and the robustness tests
we perform. Section 5 concludes.

II

Theoretical Considerations

Since new businesses typically require some amount of capital investment before they can generate
returns, the expected value of a new venture is an increasing function of the capital invested in
the startup, up to an optimal level. If individuals face credit constraints, then the amount they
invest in the business will be less than the optimal level of capital, lowering expected income
from entrepreneurship, and hence lowering the probability that the individual will become an
entrepreneur.
Debt finance is the principal form of external finance for most businesses (Berger and Udell,
3

1998; Robb and Robinson, 2013) and banks will often use the personal wealth of the owner to
assess creditworthiness of new ventures as they have no track record of the firm’s performance on
which to lend to the business, even if these are young incorporated firms (Berkowitz and White,
2000). One common approach to testing credit constraints is therefore to regress an indicator
of entry into entrepreneurship on a measure of the individual’s personal wealth and a range of
controls. If individuals do not face financing constraints, then the amount of capital that they
invest in an equivalent business should not be systematically associated with their personal wealth
and hence differences in wealth should not be relevant in predicting entry into entrepreneurship.
If the coefficient on individuals’ personal wealth is positive, however, it suggests that individuals
may be credit constrained (Evans and Jovanovic,1989, Gentry and Hubbard, 2004).
However, a positive association between personal wealth and entrepreneurship does not necessarily imply the presence of financing constraints. It is possible that an individual’s personal
wealth is endogenous. For example, if individuals with low ability are less likely to generate savings
and also less likely to become entrepreneurs, the observed correlation between personal wealth and
entrepreneurship may reflect this unobserved attribute rather than the causal effect of financing
constraints. Further, suppose that wealthier individuals are more productive as entrepreneurs than
as wage employees, say because they have access to better entrepreneurial opportunities or networks, they may be more likely to systematically sort into entrepreneurship than those who are
less wealthy. In order to control for such a spurious correlation, researchers have sought to find
exogenous shocks to personal wealth and study their effect on selection into entrepreneurship. For
example, Lindh and Ohlsson (1999) have shown that those who win lotteries are more likely to
be entrepreneurs than those who do not. Andersen and Nielsen (2012), Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian,
and Rosen (1994) and Blanchflower and Oswald (1998) have used inheritances as a source of an
unexpected shock to wealth that reduces potential financing constraints.
While these studies have shown the causal impact of a wealth increase on entrepreneurship, their
data and empirical set up is such they are not able to isolate the mechanism behind the increase in
entrepreneurship. For example, wealthy people may have lower absolute risk aversion, making them
more likely to become entrepreneurs (Evans and Jovanovic,1989; Khilstrom and Laffont, 1979), or
preferences, such as the desire to be one’s own boss, might rise with wealth (Hurst and Lusardi,
2004). If these mechanisms are important, they would lead to a positive association between wealth
and entrepreneurship even if the wealth increase was exogenous and they were not affected by credit
constraints. The concern above also applies to studies that have shown that increases in house prices
4

that are unrelated to economic activity have a causal impact on entry into entrepreneurship. While
these papers are focused on showing that house price increases cause entrepreneurship, they are
still unable to fully isolate the effect of credit constraints, because while house price increases
can improve access to collateral, they also raise an individual’s wealth. This concern might be
particularly salient given that these papers are based on time periods with extremely large house
price increases.
In this paper, we use a unique reform combined with micro data on individuals to overcome the
inferential challenge outlined above. Four features of the setting are attractive from the perspective
of our study: first, we exploit a mortgage reform that unlocked the ability to access credit backed
by housing collateral but did not directly impact the level of individuals’ wealth. We are thus able
to isolate the impact of credit constraints from wealth effects that typically confound such studies.
Second, the amount of housing collateral that was unlocked at the time of the reform was driven
the timing of the house purchase relative to the reform. As we outline in greater detail below, the
notion of using the house as collateral for the business when borrowing from a mortgage bank did
not exist in Denmark, so the timing of the house purchase was not driven by an anticipation of
unlocking collateral to finance the business. This allows us to exploit cross-sectional variation in
the intensity of the reform’s treatment, in order to generate stronger identification for our study
than a simple pre-post analysis. Third, detailed micro data collected by the Danish government and
made available to us allows us to directly observe the timing of home ownership, housing equity,
entry decisions and a whole range of individual-level correlates. This allows us to directly trace out
the effects of the reform instead of relying on aggregate data that may be confounded by omitted
variables. Since we have individual-level panel data, we can also include individual fixed effects to
account for any systematic unobserved individual factors that might confound our analysis. Finally,
unlike many reforms where one has an exogenous change but where it is hard to estimate the size
of the treatment, we have a relatively precise estimate of the size of the treatment in terms of the
amount of housing equity that was unlocked for each individual. This allows us to estimate the
magnitude of the response and hence also shed light on the degree to which individuals respond to
a large exogenous increase in access to credit.
Given the importance of the institutional setting for our identification, we first outline the key
aspects of the mortgage market and the 1992 reform, before moving to a description of the data.

II.A

The Danish mortgage market and the mortgage reform of 1992

Until 2007, mortgage debt in Denmark was provided exclusively through mortgage banks, which are
financial intermediaries specialized in the provision of mortgage loans. When granting a mortgage
loan for a home in Denmark, the mortgage bank issues bonds that directly match the repayment
profile and maturity of the loan granted. The bonds are sold on the stock exchange to investors and
the proceeds from the sale are paid out to the borrower. A basic principle underlying the design of
the Danish mortgage market is the balance-principle whereby total repayments from the borrowers
and total payments from mortgage banks to bond holders must be in balance. This principle
ensures that the mortgage banks face no funding risk and it also prevents them from charging any
risk premium. Once the bank has screened potential borrowers based on the valuation of their
property and on their ability to service the loan, (i.e. on household income), all borrowers who are
granted a loan at a given point in time face the same interest rate.
Mortgage bonds are perceived as low risk by investors because of the detailed regulation of the
mortgage market. First, mortgage banks are subject to solvency ratio requirements monitored by
the Financial Supervision Authority, and there is a legally defined threshold of limiting lending
to 80% of the house value at loan origination. In addition, each plot of land in Denmark has a
unique identification number, the title number, to which all relevant information about owners and
collateralized debt is recorded in a public title number registration system. Mortgage loans have
priority over any other loan and the system therefore secures optimum coverage for the mortgage
bank in case of default and enforced sale. Creditors can enforce their rights and demand a sale if
debtors cannot pay. The combination of the regulation around mortgage lending and protection
afforded by the title registration system implies that the loans offered by mortgage banks are very
safe for lenders and typically much cheaper than collateralized loans obtained through commercial
banks.
The Danish credit market reform studied in this paper took effect on 21 May 1992. The reform
was part of a general trend of liberalization of the financial sector in Denmark and in Europe,
although the exact timing appears to be motivated by its potential stimulating impact to the
economy during the recession of 1992. The reform was implemented with short notice and passed
through parliament in three months. The short period of time from enactment to implementation is
useful for our identification strategy as it suggests that it is unlikely that the timing of individuals’
house purchases was systematically linked to a forecast of unlocking housing collateral for the

6

business. The reform changed the rules governing mortgage loans in two critical ways that are
relevant to our study. The most important here is that it introduced the possibility of using
the proceeds from a mortgage loan for purposes other than financing real property, i.e. the reform
introduced the possibility to use housing equity as collateral for loans established through mortgage
banks where the proceeds could be used for, among other things, starting or growing a business.
The May 1992 bill introduced a limit of 60% of the house value for loans for non-housing purposes.
This limit was extended to 80% in December 1992. A second feature of the reform increased the
maximum maturity of mortgage loans from 20 to 30 years. For people who were already mortgaged
to the limit prior to the reform, and who therefore could not establish additional mortgage loans for
non-housing consumption or investment, this option potentially provided the possibility of acquiring
more liquidity by spreading out the payments over a longer period and hence reducing the monthly
outlay towards paying down the loan. Both these features therefore impacted individuals’ access
to credit without changing the value of their wealth.
Commercial banks were not restricted in offering conventional bank loans using the house as
collateral, either before or after 1992. However the granting of such bank loans was subject to a
regular credit assessment based on project’s projected cash flows and furthermore, the riskiness of
the project was priced into the loan. In practice such loans were mainly used to cover the part
of the house price that exceeded the legal limit for mortgage loans. Our discussions with practitioners suggests that bank loans using housing equity as collateral were rarely used for financing
business-startups.1 Even when granted, however, the discussion above helps to put in context that
while mortgage loans had a fixed rate and were not assessed a risk premium, the interest rate on
collateralized bank loans would be set by the bank and include a premium for the project’s riskiness. In practice, therefore, even those who might have borrowed from commercial banks would
have experienced a decline in the cost of finance due to the mortgage reform. Overall, therefore,
the reform gave households access to credit at a significantly lower price than was possible before
and allowed borrowers who could not previously obtain secured loans in commercial banks because
they were deemed too risky to now get access to credit through mortgage banks.2
1

We have conducted extensive interviews with practitioners, including a director of a major commercial bank who
was responsible for collateralized loans in this period. He states that loans based on housing equity as collateral were
practically never used for financing business start-ups as the bank typically considered projects needing loans of this
type to be of too low quality or too risky.
2
The minutes of the parliamentary committee preparing the mortgage reform, obtained through the physical
archives of the Danish Parliament, state that the mortgage reform was expected to reduce the interest rate on
secured loans from 15% to 11% for the average borrower, but the changes would be of different magnitudes across
households depending on risk characteristics of the project and the borrowers ability to service the loan.

7

The highly structured mortgage market in Denmark implied that mortgage-loan-to-value ratios
across individuals in 1992 were determined primarily by the timing of the house purchase and the
size of the down payment. Households therefore entered the reform with different equity-to-value
ratios and were thus effectively treated differentially by the reform. We use this to identify the
effect of getting access to credit by comparing the propensity to become a business owner across
households who entered the reform period with high vs. low amounts of housing equity that could
be used to collateralize loans for the business.
Table 1 outlines the key cross sectional variation we exploit in our analysis. For those in our
sample in 1991, it shows the equity to value (ETV), or the percentage of house value that is available
to collateralize for investments other than the home, broken down by an individual’s age and when
they bought their house. As can be seen from Table 1, the level of equity is much more stable across
rows than within columns. That is, the primary driver of the amount of housing equity available
to collateralize seems to be driven by the timing of the home’s purchase. Those who bought their
home after 1984 tend to have less than 20% of their housing equity available to draw on, while
those who bought their houses earlier tend to have much greater housing equity available to borrow
against. While age, which proxies for life cycle factors that would impact the timing of the home
purchase, is clearly important, Table 1 documents that there was significant variation in available
equity within age buckets, which in turn was strongly correlated with the year in which the house
was bought. Although our discussion above helps document that the reform was unanticipated,
the timing of the house purchase is clearly not random, and there may be a concern that those who
buy homes early vs. late may be systematically different along some unobserved dimension that
may matter for entrepreneurship. Our detailed demographic covariates, as well as panel data are
extremely valuable to address this concern, as they allow us to control for numerous observables as
well as include individual fixed effects.

III

Data

We use a matched employer-employee panel dataset for this study that is a significant improvement
over data used in most prior studies on financing constraints. The data is drawn from the Integrated
Database for Labor Market Research in Denmark, which is maintained by the Danish Government
and is referred to by its Danish acronym, IDA. IDA has a number of features that makes it very
attractive for this study.
First, the data is collected from government registers on an annual basis, and has detailed micro
8

data on the labor market status of individuals, including their primary occupation. An individual’s
primary occupation in IDA is characterized by their main occupation in the last week of November.
This allows us to identify entrepreneurs in a much more precise manner than many prior studies.
For example, we can distinguish the truly self-employed from those who are unemployed but may
report themselves as self-employed in surveys. We can also distinguish the self-employed from
those who employ others in their firm. Finally, since our definition of entrepreneurship is based
on an individual’s primary occupation code, we are also able to exclude part-time consultants and
individuals who may set up a side business in order to shelter taxes.
Second, the database is both comprehensive and longitudinal: all legal residents of Denmark
and every firm in Denmark is included in the database. This is particularly useful in studying entry
into entrepreneurship where such transitions are a rare event. Our sample size of entrepreneurs
is therefore considerably larger than most studies of entrepreneurship at the individual level of
analysis. Our analyses are based on a 25% random extract from this database, which provides
annual observations on each included individual for nine years from 1988-1996. It also allows us to
control for many sources of unobserved heterogeneity at the individual level, including individual
fixed effects. Given that the reform was first introduced in May of 1992 and data are recorded as
of November, we include 1992 in our post-reform period and measure individual attributes as of
1991.
Third, the database links an individual’s ID with a range of other demographic characteristics
such as their age, gender, educational qualifications, marital status, number of children, as well
as detailed information on income, assets and liabilities.3 House value, cash holdings, mortgage
debt, bank debt, and interest payments are reported automatically at the last day of the year
by banks and other financial intermediaries to the tax authorities for all Danish tax payers and
are therefore considered very reliable. While cash holdings and interest payments are recorded
directly, the house value is the tax assessed value scaled by the ratio of the tax assessed value
to market value as is recorded among traded houses in that municipality and year, and mortgage
debt is recorded by the market value of the underlying bonds at the last day of the year. The
remaining components, including the data on individual wealth, are self-reported, but subject to
auditing by the tax authorities because of the presence of both a wealth tax and an income tax.
3

Assets are further broken into six categories: housing assets, shares, deposited mortgage deeds, cash holdings,
bonds, and other assets. Liabilities are broken into four different categories up to 1992: mortgage debt, bank debt,
secured debt and other debt. Importantly, the size of the mortgage is known up to 1993. After this point definitions
of the available variables are changed. A measure of liabilities that is consistent across the entire observation period
can only be obtained for the total size of the liability stock.

9

The detailed data on liabilities, assets and capital income is particularly useful for a study looking
at entrepreneurship where wealth is likely to be correlated with a host of factors that can impact
selection into entrepreneurship (Hurst and Lusardi, 2004).
We match this individual-level data from IDA into two other registers: first, we match individuals to a register that tracks home ownership and the date that an individual last moved from an
address. This register goes back to 1970, so although our panel starts in 1988, we are able to code
the date of last move for a home owner in our database going back much further. As seen in Table
1, this match allows us to document that the timing of the house purchase is a strong driver of the
amount of equity an individual had in their house in 1991. Second, we match entrepreneurs in the
IDA data to a register recording the VAT balances of firms. While the match on this register is
not perfect (we are able to match 60% of the individuals we classify as entrepreneurs in the IDA
data), we use this as a way to examine more details on firm outcomes such as the level of sales or
profit at entry and over the life of the firm.

III.A

Sample

Since we are exploiting a mortgage reform for our analysis, we focus on individuals who are homeowners in 1991 (the year before the reform). Among home owners, we focus on those who are
between the age of 25 and 50 in 1991, to ensure that we do not capture individuals retiring into
entrepreneurship. Therefore, the youngest person at the start of our sample (in 1988) is 22 and
the oldest person at the end of our sample (in 1996) is 55. Finally, we focus on individuals
who are not employed in the agricultural industry in 1991, because, like many western European
nations, the agricultural sector in Denmark is subject to numerous subsidies and incentives that
may interact with entrepreneurship. We have access to a nine year panel for a 25% random sample
of these individuals (who were home owners, between the ages of 25 and 50 and not involved in
the agricultural sector, all in 1991), yielding data on 303,431 individuals for the years 1988-1996.
There is some attrition from our panel due to death (after 1991) and individuals who are living
abroad and hence not in the tax system in a given year (both before and after 1991). However, as
can be seen from Table 2, this attrition leads to less than a 1% fall relative to a balanced panel,
yielding a total of 2,708,892 observations.

10

III.B

Definition of Entrepreneurship

We focus our analysis of entrepreneurship on individuals who are employers (that is, self employed
with at least one employee) in a given year. We use this measure to focus on more serious businesses
and make our results more comparable with studies that use firm-level datasets (e.g. such as the
Longitudinal Business Database in the US, that are comprised of firms with at least one employee) as
well as those that study employment growth in the context of entrepreneurship. Table 2 documents
that about 3% of our sample are coded as entrepreneurs in a given year and that the annual
probability that an individual enters entrepreneurship is 0.56%.4

III.C

Descriptive Statistics

Tables 3A, 3B and 3C provide descriptive statistics on the main dependent variable and the control
variables, broken down by the buckets of housing equity available at the time of the reform. They
highlight that individuals across these buckets look quite similar on many observable dimensions,
including in their propensity to be entrepreneurs. Reflecting the variation shown in Table 1, Panel
A shows that those with greater equity to house value (ETV) bought their home earlier than those
with low ETV and that they tend to be slightly older. Reassuringly, the differences in age and
other demographic characteristics do not seem to be large and we have verified that the trends in
entry across these groups look similar before 1991. In addition, as outlined below, we include a full
set of covariate-year fixed effects to address residual sources of unobserved heterogeneity.

IV

Regression Results

We start by documenting that the reform impacted a large number of individuals and that it was
substantial. Figure 1 plots the amount of equity that was unlocked for the individuals in our
sample. The X-axis buckets individuals into 100 bins of equity to value (ETV) in 1991. We then
plot the amount of equity that was unlocked for individuals in each of these buckets (measured on
the left Y-axis) at the mean, 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile. These lines document
two important facts. First, the amount of equity unlocked was substantial. The average and the
median (which track each other closely) amount of equity unlocked by someone with an ETV of 0.6
4

These probabilities are lower than those typically associated with self employment, because we exclude self
employed individuals without any employees from our definition of entrepreneurship. As an example, of the 26
million firms in the US, 20 million are comprised of self employed individuals without any employees. Studies using
the Longitudinal Business Database and other equivalent Census data in the US have figures that are comparable to
ours. For example, Kerr, Kerr and Nanda (2014) use a definition that includes all initial employees of new firms in
the US, and get entrepreneurship rates in the US of about 5%.

11

was over 200,000 DKK (over $30,000). Some individuals with high levels of ETV had over 400,000
DKK unlocked by this reform. Second, the slope of the lines are constant, which documents that the
dollar value of equity unlocked was a constant proportion of the ETV in 1991. In other words, the
average house value across those in different ETV buckets was extremely well-balanced, suggesting
that ETV in 1991 is a good measure for the total amount of credit that was unlocked across the
buckets.
Table 3 documents that about 50% of the individuals in our sample benefited from the reform
and for these people, Figure 2 calculates the amount of equity unlocked as a share of the individual’s
annual disposable income in 1991 and shows that even in these terms, the amount unlocked was
substantial. Figure 2 shows that the median treated individual (i.e. where (ET V > 0.2) got access
to credit amounting to at least a year’s disposable income and some got access to a lot more. The
median amount of housing equity unlocked was 147,000 DKK and the average equity unlocked was
200,000 DKK, $33,819 (using the end of 1991 exchange rate of 5.91).

IV.A

Impact of Mortgage Reform

Having shown that a large number of individuals had a substantial amount of housing equity
unlocked by the reform, we next turn to documenting that individuals did respond to this access
to collateralized credit by increasing their personal debt. That is, we document that the channel
through which the reform was meant to operate did in fact show substantial traction. We focus
on interest payments on all outstanding debt rather than the debt level itself because the interest
payment measure is less noisy. However, we have verified that our results hold by looking directly
at debt as well.5 In Column 1 of Table 4, we report the results from a differences in differences
specification:

InterestP aymentsit = β0 + β1 P OSTt ∗ I(ET V91 > 0.25)i ∗ +β2 I(ET V91 > 0.25)i + γi Xi,t + it (1)

where InterestP aymentsit refers to the total interest payments on outstanding debt paid by
individual i in year t. Xi,t refer to fixed effects for the control variables outlined in Panel A of Table
3 interacted with year dummies. This includes fixed effects for the individual’s gender, educational
5
The majority of debt is composed of mortgage debt which is recorded in our data by its market value which is
influenced by market fluctuations in the interest rate. Only fixed rate mortgages are available in this period, and
interest payments are therefore deterministically related to the coupon rate and thus free of influence from market
fluctuations.

12

background, marital status, children, as well as fixed effects for age cohorts (one for each year from
25-50) interacted with year fixed effects.6

The dummy I(ET V91 > 0.25)i takes the value 1 for

individuals whose ETV in 1991 was greater than 0.25. We focus on 0.25 as those below this level
are unlikely to have benefited from the reform. The reform only allowed individuals to borrow up
to 80% of the home value; even if individuals lowered their payments by extending a mortgage from
20-30 years, those below 0.25 in ETV would have not gained sufficient equity to extract any debt
for non-housing purposes. Thus I(ET V91 > 0.25)i captures those who were treated by the reform.
P OSTt takes a value of 1 for the years 1992-1996 and zero otherwise. Standard errors are clustered
at the individual level. Our main coefficient of interest is β1 which captures the relative impact
of the treatment group in the post period compared to the pre-period within the cells specified by
the covariate-year fixed effects.
As can be seen from column 1 of Table 4, those in higher ETV buckets, by construction, had
smaller interest payments prior to the reform. However, those in the treated group increased
their interest payments by approximately 3,200 DKK more than the control group from 19921996. Column 2 shows that this was not driven by the fact that those in high ETV buckets were
in municipalities that experienced differential house price changes or happened to be working in
certain industries. It is robust to the inclusion of municipality-year and industry-year fixed effects.
Municipality-year fixed effects refer to a fixed effect for each of 297 municipalities interacted with
year dummies. Industries are measured at the SIC 1 level and hence control for being in one of 9
industries associated with the individual’s primary occupation in 1991. Finally in Column 3, we
add individual fixed effects. Since our identification is driven off the timing of the house purchase
relative to the reform – which, although unanticipated is not random – we need to account for the
fact that those who bought their homes earlier (or did not move) may be systematically different
to those who did not. Including individual fixed effects is particularly effective as it helps us
document the impact of the reform within individual, by accounting for any fixed differences across
individuals in our sample. The inclusion of individual fixed effects implies that our identification
now comes from within-individual differences over time. The fact that the coefficients are so stable
across columns 1-3 is reassuring, since it suggests that conditional on controlling appropriately for
covariates, the amount of equity released by the reform was unrelated to fixed individual attributes.
Columns 4-6 of Table 4 break up the dummy variable I(ET V91 > 0.25)i into three categories,
6
That is, we compare those who are, say 25 years in 1988 with other 25 year olds in 1988 over the entire sample
period and not to those who are 24 in 1988, so are 25 in 1989.

13

so that we now compare how being in each of the top three quartiles of ETV distribution had
an impact on credit extraction following the reform. The results again provide a clear pattern of
increasing credit extraction for those with greater unlocked housing equity, with interest payments
rising from about 2,000 DKK more in the post period for those whose ETV was between 0.25
and 0.5 to 4,600 DKK more for those in the highest ETV bucket. The magnitude of the increase
in interest payments in column 3 corresponds to an increase in the debt level of about 37,031
DKK ($6,266) which is equivalent to homeowners borrowing an average of $0.19 for each dollar of
housing collateral unlocked by the reform. Interestingly, this increase in borrowing is identical to
the elasticity of borrowing reported by Mian and Sufi (2014), when studying house price gains and
US household spending from 2002-2006. While on average, the increased borrowing is about a fifth
of the increase in available collateral, a few people extract a lot of credit while many choose not
to. This variance in credit extraction is masked in the OLS regressions, but in unreported quantile
regressions we find that, as might be expected, the average results are being driven by a smaller
number of individuals extracting a much greater percentage of the collateralized credit available
for them to draw on.
The results from Table 4 document that the reform not only had the potential to unlock credit
but it in fact did lead to a strong ‘first stage’ where those in the treatment group extracted more
credit that those in the control group. In Appendix B and Appendix Figure B2, we report the
coefficients from a dynamic specification, where the coefficient in column 3 of Table 4 is interacted
with year dummies and is shown relative to 1992. It shows a pattern consistent with reform leading
to the increase in credit for those in the treated group.
IV.A.1

Change in Net Entrepreneurship

Having established that the reform unlocked a significant amount of housing collateral and that
those in the treatment group responded to this by increasing their personal debt, we now turn
to study the impact of the reform on entrepreneurship. If credit constraints were holding back
potential entrepreneurs in our sample, we should see that those who received an exogenous increase
in access to credit would be more likely to be entrepreneurs. To examine this, we report the results
from the difference in differences reduced form specification:

EN T REP REN EU Rit = β0 +β1 P OSTt ∗I(ET V91 > 0.25)i +β2 I(ET V91 > 0.25)i +γi Xi,t +it (2)
where the empirical framework and the identification strategy is the same as that for the re14

gressions in Table 4, but where we now have entrepreneurship as the outcome variable. Specifically,
the dependent variable is an indicator that takes a value of 1 if the individual is coded as being an
entrepreneur in year t. All regressions in Table 5 are run as linear probability (OLS) models rather
than non-linear logit or probit regressions given the large number of fixed effects. Note that since we
include entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs in our sample in each year, these estimations measure
the impact of the reform on net entrepreneurship (being an entrepreneur), as opposed to remaining
an entrepreneur or becoming an entrepreneur (which we examine in subsequent analyses).
Columns 1-3 of Table 5 report the results for the indicator I(ET V91 > 0.25)i and as with Table
4, build up from including only covariate-year fixed effects to including individual fixed effects. Note
that since our dependent variable is a binary variable, the regressions with individual fixed effects
are effectively identifying off switchers - that is, those who either enter or exit entrepreneurship.
The fact that, as with Table 4, the coefficients on the interaction term P OSTt ∗ I(ET V91 > 0.25)i
are extremely stable is reassuring as it suggests that the subset of individuals who switched into
or out of entrepreneurship was representative of the larger cross-section of individuals studied in
Columns (1) and (2).
The magnitudes of the coefficients in Table 5 are small. The coefficient on P OSTt ∗ I(ET V91 >
0.25)i in column 3 of Table 5 implies a 12 basis point increase in net entrepreneurship. Given
the baseline probability of being an entrepreneur was 3% in the pre-period (as seen in Table
3), this implies about a 4% relative increase in the probability of being an entrepreneur for the
treated group in the post period. This increase is small given the average increase in available
home equity of approximately $30,000, which is large in absolute terms and in relative terms to
annual disposable income. Figure 3 plots the coefficients of the dynamic specifications, where the
interaction shown in column 3 is instead broken into annual interactions, and shown relative to
1992. The dynamic specifications show a pattern consistent with the reform driving the increases
in net entrepreneurship and also show that the small coefficient is in fact quite stable over the few
years following the reform.
Columns 4-6 break the dummy variable I(ET V91 > 0.25)i into three equal categories and show
that the increase is driven largely by those with an ET V > 0.5. While those with an ET V > 0.25
do exhibit a slight increase, it is not statistically significant. The magnitudes in Column 6, together
with the baseline entry rates shown in Table 3 suggest that the reform increased the propensity to
be an entrepreneur for those with substantial increases in equity by about 5.5%. Given that the
average amount of equity unlocked in the highest ETV bracket was approximately $55,000, our
15

results highlight that while clearly impacting entrepreneurship, the effect of the relaxed constraints
were small relative to the size of the treatment, even for those with large increases in available
housing collateral.7
Our results showing an increase in the amount of entrepreneurship leads us to examine the
channel through which this occurred. The reform could have impacted existing businesses that
were more likely to survive and/or impact the entry of new businesses. We now turn to examine
these two channels.
IV.A.2

Survival of existing businesses

To look at the impact of the reform on surviving businesses, we focus on all individuals who
were active entrepreneurs in 1988 and study the survival of these businesses until 1996. Table 2
documents that 9,183 individuals were active entrepreneurs in 1988. For these entrepreneurs, we
run the same difference-in-difference specification outlined in equation (2) above, and where the
dependent variable continues to take a value of 1 if they are alive in year t, but takes a value of 0
if they fail.
Looking across Columns 1-3 of Table 6, we can see that as with Table 4 and 5, the inclusion
of industry-year, municipality-year and individual fixed effects do not impact the coefficient on
P OSTt ∗ I(ET V91 > 0.25)i . The coefficient in column 3 of Table 6 documents a statistically significant effect on survival for existing businesses. About 65% of the businesses in the control group are
still alive in 1996, implying that the 3.2 percentage point increase in survival is equivalent to a 5%
higher likelihood of survival relative to those with low ETV. Columns 4-6 show that these effects
are even stronger for those that received the largest treatment, rising to about a 7% higher chance
of survival relative to the control group for those in the highest quartile of ETV, but only 3% for
those in the 0.25-0.5 bucket. The fact that the results are stronger for the the group that received
the largest treatment is reassuring, since it supports the mechanism through which we expect the
response to occur.
One would expect that firms in industries that are more reliant on external finance to benefit
more from the ability to borrow against the home. In order to look in to this we allocate firms to
industries that are more versus less dependent on external finance. We do this by by calculating,
in a pre-period, the change in debt associated with starting a business in each of 111 different
7

In unreported regressions and consistent with Hurst and Stafford (2004), Leth-Petersen (2010) and Mian and
Sufi (2011) we find that the majority of credit that was extracted was used for large consumption items such as home
improvement or buying a new car, rather than in investment into businesses.

16

industries. Industries that are above the median according to this measure are classified as being
more dependent on external finance. The details of the industry allocation are provided in Appendix
A, where we also show a positive correspondence to a similar measure constructed using the Survey
of Small Business Finances in the US.
Table 7 expands Table 6 by splitting it into firms in industries that are capital intensive vs. not.
Comparing column (1) and (2) suggests that the effect of the credit market reform was bigger for
firms in capital intensive industries, but we note that the difference between the effect estimated in
column (1) and (2) is not statistically different from zero. Expanding the number of ETV categories,
as is done in columns (3) and (4) reveals that the effect is driven by the higher ETV groups, and
that it is only the highest ETV group where one sees magnitudes that are statistically different
from zero.
Although we see existing firms being more likely to survive when their owners receive a larger
increase in available credit, this could also be driven by two possible mechanisms. On the one hand,
it could imply that firms that were previously constrained were forced to shut down and could now
benefit from the increased credit availability to support the operations of the firm. On the other
hand, one might imagine that the increase in credit may have led firms that were badly run to
continue operating because their founders had a preference for being self employed, but did not
need to justify this decision to the bank. To tell these two mechanisms apart, we look in Table 8
at firm performance for the set of firms that were in existence at the time of reform. In particular,
we focus on firm-level employment, sales and gross profit (sales less purchases). These outcomes
are obtained from VAT accounts, which as we outlined above, only give us a 60% match with the
firms in our sample.8
The first three columns of Table 8 report results for the balanced panel of firms. That is, when a
firm exits the sample, we code their sales, profits and employment as zero. This has the advantage of
ensuring the results are not driven by selection, but on the other hand, they confound performance
and survival and hence provide an upper bound for the performance effects of the reform. The
next three columns focus on the set of firms that survived until 1996, so they are not confounding
performance and survival, but they are a selected sample since they were strong enough to survive
across the entire period. The first three columns of Table 8 show that on average, existing firms
increase profit added by about 40,000 DKK, sales by about 117,000 DKK and employment by the
8
In order to ensure that our performance results are not due to a sample selection bias, we have reproduced table 6
using only the subset of firms we were able to match in Table 8. These result were not different from those presented
in Table 8, convincing us that our performance results were not driven by sample selection bias.

17

equivalent of 0.2 full time employees. The effects are estimated imprecisely and are only significant
at the 10% level. This marginal increase in performance is, of course, conflated by the higher
survival probabilities of the firms. In Columns 4-6 we restrict our analysis to firms that survived
the entire period and find that for these firms, the results are reversed. The marginal firm that
survived over the entire period due to the reform seems to have been of lower quality (although
imprecisely estimated). In sum, our results suggest that the reform increased survival, but that it
did not lead to an increase in performance conditional on survival.
IV.A.3

Entry into entrepreneurship

We next turn to examining entry into entrepreneurship. Table 9 reports the coefficients from the
linear probability models with the same specifications, where the dependent variable now takes a
value of 1 if the individual was not an entrepreneur in t − 1 but became an entrepreneur in year t.
As with Tables 4, 5 and 6, Table 9 shows the coefficients are extremely stable across columns. It
shows that there was also a marked increase in entry following the reform. Given that the baseline
probability of entry is 0.56% (as seen in Table 2), the coefficient in column 3 of Table 9 implies
that the treated group experienced a 10% increase in entry following the reform. Columns 4-6 show
that similar to the patterns in Table 6, the entry was largely driven by those in the highest ETV
bucket, suggesting that the amount of equity that needs to be released for the collateral channel to
play a role can be substantial.
Table 10 further breaks this entry into those starting businesses in industries that were classified
as being more dependent on external finance vs. less dependent. Comparing columns 1 and 2 of
Table 10 with column 3 of Table 9 shows that the majority of the increased entry came from those
entering more capital intensive businesses. In fact, they show that the increase in less capital
intensive industries was not statistically different from zero. On the other hand, entry into capital
intensive industries was not only statistically significant, but larger than the entry into less capital
intensive industries. This finding is also reinforced by looking at columns 3 and 4 of Table 10, where
the greatest impact of the reform seems to be among those in the highest ETV bucket starting
businesses that were more dependent on external finance.
The results associated with net entrepreneurship in Table 5 show smaller elasticities than would
be expected seeing the results in Table 9. To investigate further, therefore, we examine the extent
to which the entrants start businesses that survive a long period of time. We separate entrants
into those who started businesses that last less than 3 years relative to those who found businesses

18

that last at least 3 years. These results are reported in Table 11. Comparing these businesses
reveals a striking pattern. The vast majority of the entrants are those that fail within 2 years of
entry, which is why the overall number of entrepreneurs, reported in Table 5, shows a much smaller
increase. Columns 3 and 4 show that the churning is associated with all the buckets of ETV, while
those with the largest increase in available collateral also start some firms that last more than 3
years. Interestingly, looking at columns 5 and 6 shows that one potential reason that these business
owners seem to fail is because those in the treatment group significantly increase the likelihood that
they will start businesses in industries where they have no prior experience.
This result is interesting as it suggests that part of what the reform allowed individuals to do
was experiment by starting businesses that the bank may not have given them credit for. This could
be seen as either good or bad: on the one hand, if asymmetric information prevented banks from
lending to high quality businesses, then the reform would facilitate the entry of better firms. For
example, the banks might incorrectly ration credit to individuals who had no prior background in an
industry, but who were potentially high quality entrepreneurs. Similarly, since banks are concerned
with downside protection, it is possible that the access to housing collateral allowed individuals to
start riskier firms, that may have been more likely to fail, but conditional on surviving, in fact did
better. On the other hand, if banks were rationing credit to those who should not have started
businesses because the projects were of low quality, this suggests that the credit market may have
been working reasonably well prior to the reform.
In order to tease these two explanations apart, we turn to examine the performance of the
businesses, similar to the estimations in Table 8. In Table 12, we study the three-year gross profits,
sales and employment of entrants, for all firms that entered between 1988 and 1996. These outcomes
are obtained from VAT accounts, which as we outlined above, only give us a 60% match with the
firms in our sample. Since we have fewer observations in this table, we are unable to include a
full set of controls interacted with year dummies but instead include individual controls observed
in 1991 as well as year fixed effects in all regressions, and add municipality fixed effects for some
specifications. The results show that profits, sales and employment were lower in the post period
for firms started by owners who got access to home equity, and even when considering the subset
of entrants who survived at least three years in Columns 3-4, we do not find any evidence that the
performance metrics improved as a consequence of the reform. Columns 5-7 report the results from
quantile regressions to show that the results in columns 1-4 are not driven by outliers and that they
are equally present across the profit distribution. Overall, these results point to the fact that the
19

reform seems to have lowered the discipline of external finance. While we cannot conclusively say
whether these were negative NPV projects, it suggests that the possibility of tapping into home
equity either allowed individuals to start lower quality projects, that would have had a hard time
getting financed by the bank, (but could be funded by personal debt since the bank was no longer
lending based on the attributes of the project). That is, the marginal project funded in the post
period by those with access to home equity was of lower quality than the average quality of projects
started prior to the reform. This is an interesting result that also helps to reconcile the fact that
gross entry following the reform was larger than the net effect of the reform on entrepreneurship.

V

Discussion and Conclusions

We combine a unique mortgage reform in Denmark with micro data to study how an exogenous
increase in access to credit through the unlocking of housing collateral for personal loans had an
impact on entrepreneurship. Our context is particularly attractive since it allows us to distinguish
the credit channel from wealth effects, as well as quantify the size of the increased access to credit,
allowing us to precisely estimate the magnitude of credit constraints in our context. The reform
had a sizeable impact on the ability to draw on debt backed by home equity. The average increase
in home equity was $30,000, equivalent to over a year’s worth of disposable income for the median
treated individual in our sample. Yet we find that this led to only a 12 basis point increase in
entrepreneurship on average, which translated into a 4% increase in net entrepreneurship relative
to the baseline. Thus, although we find a positive and statistically significant effect of relaxing
credit constraints on entrepreneurship, the magnitudes are small. Furthermore, we find that an
important reason for the small magnitude was that the marginal business founded in the post
period by those who benefited from the reform was of lower quality, leading to mostly churning
entry, where the new entrants failed within two years of entry. This is similar to findings by Kerr and
Nanda (2009) who find that while the US banking deregulations over the 1980s led to an increase
in entrepreneurship, a disproportionate share of this increase was in churning entry, implying that
the net effect of deregulation was less than that suggested by papers looking only at gross entry
(Black and Strahan, 2002; Cetorelli and Strahan, 2006).
Our results therefore paint a more nuanced picture of the extent to which financing constraints
are important in settings with well-developed credit markets, and the role that home equity can play
in alleviating these. The fact that housing collateral shifts the bank’s adjudication decision from a
specific project to the creditworthiness of the borrower has the potential to be a dual edged sword:
20

on the one hand, good projects that were precluded from entry due to asymmetric information
may be able to be started or sustained. On the other hand, optimistic entrepreneurs or those with
non-pecuniary benefits to own businesses may start lower quality businesses because they do not
face the same discipline from the bank.
Our results also speak to the longstanding question of the importance of credit constraints for
entrepreneurship. They highlight the importance of considering both entry and net entrepreneurship as outcome variables, since policies that aim to increase entry may not necessarily translate
into equivalent increases in net entrepreneurship if the marginal entrants are of lower quality and
are much more likely to fail.

Table 3: Summary statistics
Panel A presents summary statistics for the 303,431 individuals in our sample based on their equity to value ratio in
1991 being either in the range of [0%-25%], (25%-50%], (50%-75%] or (75%-100%]. Panel B shows summary
statistics for subset of individuals that where active employers in 1991. Panel C shows summary statistics for the
subset of individuals that were new employers in 1991. Housing assets refer to the tax assessed valuation of the
individual’s property scaled with the ratio of market prices to tax assessed house values for house that have been
traded in that municipality and year. Non housing assets include the individual's other assets including stocks, bonds
and deposits. All variables are measured in 1991 before the reform. Value-add, sales and employment are computed
based on the firms where information is available based on a match to the VAT register.

Table 4 reports estimates from OLS regressions, where the dependent variable is the individual’s total interest payment in each year. The main
RHS variables are the bucket of equity to value in 1991 and the buckets interacted with an indicator for the post mortgage reform period. All
columns include year fixed effects interacted with fixed effects for birth-cohort, educational level, partner, gender and having children, each
measured in 1991. Column (2-3) and (5-6) include municipality-year fixed effects and industry-year fixed effects. Column (3) and (6) further
include individual fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the individual level and are reported in parentheses. *, **, *** indicate statistically
different from zero at 5%, 1% and 0.1% level.

Table 6 reports estimates from OLS regressions, where the dependent variable is an indicator variable if the individual is an entrepreneur in that
year. The sample consists of individuals who were entrepreneurs in 1988 over the period 1988-1996. The main RHS variables are the bucket of
equity to value in 1991 and the buckets interacted with an indicator for the post mortgage reform period. All columns include year fixed effects
interacted with fixed effects for birth-cohort, educational level, partner, gender and having children, each measured in 1991. Column (2-3) and (56) include municipality-year fixed effects and industry-year fixed effects. Column (3) and (6) further include individual fixed effects. Standard
errors are clustered at the individual level and are reported in parentheses. +, *, **, *** indicate statistically different from zero at 10%, 5%, 1%

Table 12 shows results from a repeated cross-section regression where the dependent variable is the gross profit (sales less purchases) [Panel A], sales [Panel B]
and employment [Panel C] for the first three years for each entry-cohort. The key RHS variable is the bucket of equity to value >0.25 in 1991 and the bucket
interacted with an indicator for the post mortgage reform period. In each year the dependent variable is censored at the 1st and 99th percentile. Column (1-7)
include year fixed effects, and individual controls measured in 1991 (birth-cohort, gender, educational level, partner and kids dummy). Columns (2), (4) and (5-7)
include municipality fixed effects. For OLS regressions standard errors are clustered at the individual level and are reported in parentheses. For Quantile
regressions standard errors are bootstrapped with 100 replications. +, *, **, *** indicate statistically different from zero at 10%, 5%, 1% and 0.1% level.

Appendix A: Capital Intensity measures
Our measure of capital intensity is constructed from the reliance of external finance of firm starts in the
pre-reform period. With 111-industry classifications, we take all entries occurring in the period from
1988-1991 into a given industry and take the average change in total interest payment from time t-1 to
time t of the entrepreneur starting a firm in a given industry at time t. We next sort these industry
averages from high to low and define high capital intensive industries as industries above the median.
The median change is 28,000 DKK (approximately 4,700 USD). With a prevailing interest rate of
roughly 10% in the period this corresponds to a debt increase of 280,000 DKK (approximately 47,000
USD) for an individual starting a median capital intensive firm.
As validation exercise of our capital intensity measure, table A1 reports the correlation coefficients
with other measures of capital intensity, both weighted and un-weighted by the number of entries that
occurs in a given industry. First, the measure is robust to measuring interest payments from t-1 to t+1
as opposed to t-1 to t relative to entry. Further, the change interest rate payments associated with entry
in a given industry is positively correlated with the first year record sales for the same industry. Finally
the measure is positively correlated with the mean and median amount of external financing need
reported in the Survey of Small Business (SSB) based on US-data at the 2-digit SIC level.
Table A1: Correlation of capital intensity measures
Table A1 reports correlation coefficients between average changes in total interest
payments from t-1 to t for an entrepreneur entering a given industry in 1988-1991 with
other measures of capital intensity. First year sales are computed based on the firms for
which we observe VAT data during its first year of operation. SSB average and median

Figure A1 below shows the distribution of increases in interest payments at business start-ups across
selected G111 industries. We define capital-intensive industries as industries that have above median
growth in interest payments at the point of the start-up as is indicated by the red line. The figure shows
that there is considerable variation within broad industry classes, so that we observe entries that are
capital intensive and not within almost all broad industry groups.

Appendix B: Interest payments and amortization
During the period of analysis, the typical mortgage taken out for the financing of house purchases is a
30 year mortgage bond with fixed yearly instalments. With fixed installments, over time, the proportion
of the installment that goes to accruing interest payments will fall and, conversely, principal repayment
will increase. Given that we study interest payments, this will, absent the 1992-mortage reform,
introduce a particular time trend in the interest payments depending on how long the household has had
the mortgage, where the rate at which the principal is re-paid increases with the time the mortgage has
been held.
To illustrate this point, we compare a stylized theoretical example of two identical households that buys
a house in 1972 and 1985 via, respectively, a 10% and 12% fixed rate mortgage (the prevailing interest
rate at the time of purchase). In our data we locate their counterparts and compare median value of the
interest payments relative to the 1991 level. Figure B1 below plots the difference between the relative
amount of interest payments for the stylized example and the sample analog. We note that the post
reform period is confounded by the ability to extract equity, and hence the divergence post the reform
between the data and the stylized example should be attributed to the reform. This difference is
consistent with the Figure B2 which shows a dynamic specification of model (3) in table 4 where an
analogous pre-trend is shown. Absent the reform we would have expected the relative difference to
have continued along the same trajectory as in the stylized theoretical example.

Appendix Figure B2: Total interest payments by equity to value in 1991
Appendix Figure B2 shows a dynamic version of model (3) in table 4, where an indicator of being an
individual who was treated by the reform is interacted with year dummies and shown relative to 1992.
The model includes the full set of covariate-year fixed effects as well as individual fixed effects and
standard errors are clustered at the individual level. The trend observed in the pre-period is due to the
mechanical nature of payments for those with more vs. less mortgage outstanding (see appendix B
above for details).
