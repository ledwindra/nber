The Internet and Job Search

March 2008, Revised September 2008
JEL No. J01,J6,J62,J63
ABSTRACT
This paper examines how the Internet has impacted job search behavior. Examining those who use
the Internet for job seeking purposes, I show that the vast majority are currently employed. These employed
job seekers are more likely to leave their current employer and are more likely to make an employment-to-employment
transition. Examining the unemployed, I find that over the past ten years the variety of job search methods
used by the unemployed has increased and job search behavior has become more extensive. Furthermore,
the Internet has led to reallocation of effort among various job search activities.

1. Introduction
As dot-coms proliferated and at-home Internet use sky-rocketed, many economists began
to speculate on how this new technology would change the labor market. In 2000 Alan Krueger
wrote that “The Internet is rapidly changing the way workers search for jobs and employers
recruit workers… [with] significant implications for unemployment, pay, and productivity.”
Autor (2000) outlines several of the ways in which the Internet might improve matching and
provides evidence on the use of the Internet for job search. In the ensuing years the Internet has
become an important part of people’s lives and jobs: in 2004, 73% of households had access to
the Internet and 58% and 28% of adults used the Internet at home and work, respectively.1 Yet,
we still know very little about how the Internet has impacted job search and employment.
This research focuses on how the Internet may be changing job search activities. For
workers, the Internet may reduce the cost of acquiring information about jobs both by impacting
how workers learn about job openings and how they respond to openings. Job posting boards are
one of the clearest ways in which the Internet has increased information about available jobs;
however these boards are a small part of the Internet’s impact on employment information.
Beyond learning that a job opening exists, it is possible for a job seeker to glean information
about the characteristics of the job and the firm. Information exists not only in a job posting, but
through company web sites and other external sites that provide information about the industry
or even the particular firm. Websites such as vault.com provide detailed information about
salaries and work environments including salary ranges for various positions at specific
companies. In addition, many sites allow current and former employees to anonymously discuss

the Internet at work also use the Internet at home; however the majority (59%) of those who use the Internet at home
don’t have access at work.

or provide information about corporate culture and work life. Beyond the web, email is a vital
part of how the Internet has potentially changed job search. Indeed, through the use of email,
personal networks may be a complement to the Internet, allowing workers to learn about
openings or let others know that they are seeking a new position. Having learned about a
position or a company, the Internet facilitates applying for openings and communicating with
potential employers, as these things can be done 24 hours a day, without ever leaving one’s home
or work desk.
Workers have turned to the Web to take advantage of this new wealth of employment
information with more than one in four online adults visiting job or career information sites in
2004.2 And workers believe that the Internet is helping them find jobs. Figure 1 shows that
among those that began a job in mid-2002, 22% credited the Internet as the primary means by
which they found their job. A little over half of those citing the Internet pointed to a posting on a
general job board, while the rest said that specialty job search engines or company Web sites had
been their primary source for finding their most recent job. Furthermore, over half of those
surveyed felt that the Internet was an effective method of job search (however this is still fewer
than those selecting newspaper ads and personal referrals as effective).
These survey responses indicate that workers are integrating online job search into their
regular search process. This research examines how job search behavior has changed in the
wake of the Internet. The paper proceeds as follows: the first section starts by examining growth
in online usage and Internet-based job search using data from the 1998, 2001, and 2003 Current
Population Statistics (CPS) Computer and Internet Use Supplements. The next section considers

2

Data are from Forrester Research’s 2005 Technographics Benchmark. Individuals who use the Internet were asked
how often they use certain types of Web sites. This data is comparable to that found using the 1998, 2000, and 2001
CPS Computer Supplements which finds that among those with Internet access, online job search is used by a fifth
of the employed and over half of the unemployed.

3

how the availability of the Internet has impacted the type of job search activity undertaken by the
unemployed examining trends in these activities over time. This research demonstrates that over
the past ten years the variety of job search methods used by the unemployed has increased. We
then turn to examining the relationship between changes in state-level annual Internet penetration
rates and Internet job search activity by the unemployed. The latter approach demonstrates that
the Internet is associated with a reallocation of effort among various job search activities and that
job search activity grows as a state’s Internet penetration rate expands. In particular, higher
Internet penetration is associated with a significantly higher probability of contacting an
employer directly—potentially highlighting the role of email in job search. The last section
considers the relationship between Internet job search and employment outcomes for on-the-job
online job searchers. Using the longitudinal aspect of the CPS, I follow employed workers in the
CPS Computer Supplements and find that those using the Internet to search for a job online are
more likely to have left their employer one month later. Examining access to the Internet rather
than job search per se reveals that, conditional on observable predictors of Internet use, those
who use the Internet are more likely to have changed jobs.

2. Descriptive Statistics
The December 1998, September 2001, and October 2003 CPS Computer and Internet Use
Supplements ask respondents about their and their households’ computer and Internet use in
addition to the usual battery of employment questions. These data reveal that online job search
has grown rapidly among the employed, unemployed, and even those not in the labor force.
Panel A of Table 1 shows that in 1998 5.7% of adults searched online for jobs, rising to 11.5%
by 2003.

4

Much of the increase in online job search during this period was due to the rise in access
to the Internet: the total share of those online using the Internet to search for a job was
unchanged between 1998 and 2001. In both 1998 and 2001, among those online, over half of the
unemployed, one-sixth of the employed, and around 10% of those out of the labor force engaged
in online job search. Between 2001 and 2003 the increase in online job search activity was
somewhat greater than the increase in Internet usage overall, and in 2003 nearly a fifth of those
online reported engaging in job search activities on the web including nearly two-thirds of the
online unemployed and a fifth of the online employed.
Panel B of Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for home and total online usage among the
employed, unemployed, and those not in the labor force for 2003. Total access to the Internet is
greater than home access for all groups. The non-home access comes from a variety of sources
and raises access for the unemployed and employed by 12 and 14 percentage points respectively.
It is worth noting that access to the Internet through work drives very little of the difference
between the Internet access of the employed and unemployed. More than 80% of the employed
in 2003 who have regular Internet access at work also have access at home, however the opposite
is not true: many people who get access through home do not have access at work.
Among those employed, 57% used the Internet at home and 14% searched for a job
online. While only 47% of the unemployed have online access at home, they are much more
likely to search for work online (38%). However, the large difference in the stock of the
employed relative to the unemployed means that the unemployed are a very small share of online
job searchers. In 2003, the unemployed represented only 11% of those searching for a job
online, a similar share to those not in the labor force (who comprised 12%). The majority, 77%
of those searching for a job online, are currently employed. These descriptive statistics illustrate

5

the importance of the employed in assessing the potential overall effect of the Internet on job
matching.
Once we have conditioned on who uses the Internet, there is surprisingly little
heterogeneity between demographic groups in the tendency to search for a job online. Table 2
shows the proportions of different demographic groups searching for a job online both among the
total population and among those with Internet access. While there are differences in online job
search by income, age, race, and gender differences among the unemployed, these differences
are more muted when conditioning on those with Internet access. In contrast, there are greater
differences in online job search by age among the employed who use the Internet, with online
job search falling with age. Similarly, among those not in the labor force the percent using the
Internet to search for a job falls sharply with age. These differences likely reflect the desire to
find a job, and thus differences in general search activity, with the value of changing employers,
or entering the labor force, falling with age. For instance, among those aged 25 to 30 and online,
28% of the employed and 15% of those out of the labor force were searching for a job online.
These proportions fall to only 4% and 1%, respectively, among those over age 65.
Those with more education and income have greater access to the Internet; as such,
Internet job search rises with education and income. However, after conditioning on access to
the Internet there is little relationship between income and job search. Among the online
employed, job search falls slightly with income; that pattern is not seen among the online
unemployed, perhaps suggesting that higher income employed individuals are less likely to use
the Internet to search for a job because they are more likely to be in a better match or to have
built up job-specific human capital. In contrast, a positive relationship remains for Internet job
search and education among those using the Internet, perhaps indicating that the Internet is more

6

valuable as a tool for job search among the highly educated. However, it may also be that those
with more education have a greater underlying tendency to engage in job search activities
whether online or off. Finally, it is worth noting that blacks who are employed or not in the
labor force are more likely than employed whites to search for a job online, conditional on
having access to the Internet.

3. Job Search by the Unemployed
We now turn to asking whether job search activity has changed as a result of the Internet.
By making it cheaper to apply for jobs and to find job ads, the Internet should cause people to
engage more frequently in these activities. As such, we should expect an increase in search
intensity for job search activities that are made cheaper by the Internet. However, while “search
intensity” has a clear meaning in matching models, we lack a good empirical counterpart for this
concept. Theory has less clear implications for easily measured job search metrics. For instance,
time spent searching for a job may either increase or decrease depending on the elasticity of
substitution between job search and other activities. The most readily available data covering the
period of rapid Internet adoption measures job search activity at the extensive margin—the
number of search activities in which a person engages. Whether the Internet causes individuals
to search more or less extensively depends on the relative price changes of the different job
search methods. For example, if emailing friends and contacts is now much easier than before,
individuals may decide to forgo another activity such as contacting a union or professional
organization.
Over the relevant time period—1994 through 2003—the monthly CPS consistently
captures the types of job search activities undertaken by the unemployed. Specifically, the

7

unemployed are asked to list all the things that they have done in the previous four weeks to look
for a job. The categories do not include Internet job search, but they don’t exclude them either.
For example, the category “submitted resume” could apply to electronic submission and those
who “looked at job ads” could have done so via online or newsprint advertisements.
The Internet is likely to have changed job search at the extensive margin if either Internet
search makes methods more complementary—for example if reading job ads online makes you
more likely to submit resumes because it can be easily done electronically—or if Internet search
changes the relative costs of different job search methods. Looking at the US as a whole, Figure
2 shows that there has been a steady and significant increase in job search by the unemployed—
at least at the extensive margin—over the past decade. The national unemployment rate falls
through much of the period, hitting a low-point in 2000 and rising for the next few years. In
contrast, the average number of search methods rises not only through the recent downturn but
also through the long boom.3 In contrast to what would be expected given the changes in the
broader economy over the period, the percentage of the unemployed who sent out a resume in
the previous four weeks rose from 36% in 1994 to 48% at the peak of the boom in 2000, and
continued to rise to 55% in 2003 as unemployment rose. Similarly, the proportion looking at job
ads rose from 17% to 23% and ultimately 30% over the same period. Moreover, the anonymity
of the Web does not appear to be being replacing traditional networking, as the percentage of the
unemployed contacting friends or relatives went from 16% to 19% over the period.
To gain further insight into whether the growth in the Internet was associated with these
changes in job search behavior we turn to examining how job search behavior changed across
states as Internet penetration in states grew. States adopted the Internet differentially, with some
states growing quickly early on, while others had larger growth several years later. Proprietary

Blau and Robbins (1990) show that individuals search more extensively with high unemployment.

8

data obtained from Forrester Research provides data from large annual surveys on whether an
individual is actively online (defined as accessing the Web at least 3 times in the past 3 months).
While the online usage rates calculated from the Forrester data are quite similar to online usage
rates calculated from the CPS Computer and Internet Use Supplements, the Forrester data
provide a longer time period over which to examine online access and to look at job search
behavior. The Forrester surveys commenced in 1997 and contain roughly 100,000 respondents
per year through 2001 and 60,000 per year thereafter. Additionally, Forrester captures
retrospective information about when a person first went online allowing data to be constructed
back to 1994. I combine current and retrospective data from these surveys to measure annual
state online penetration rates.4 Measurements for 1992 and 1993 are interpolated following
Goolsbee and Brown (2002).5

Prior to 1992, Internet penetration, while unmeasured, is

effectively zero. Table 3 shows the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of state
online penetration rates defined to include those who regularly used the Internet.6 By 2002 70%
of the US used the Internet, but this varied from 53% to 80% across states.
Using the growth in the Internet over time and across states we can examine the
relationship between changes in job search behavior in a given state-year with changes in access
to the Internet in that state-year as measured by the change in the proportion of the population
using the Internet in that state-year. Table 4 reports the results of the following regression run
for each search method:7

4

Forrester provides data for 48 states plus the District of Columbia, omitting Hawaii and Alaska from their surveys.
Brown and Goolsbee (2002) calculated rates for 1992 and 1993 by scaling 1994 online usage by the overall rate of
growth of domain names. I applied their scaling to my estimates of 1994 online usage; my estimate differs from
theirs because I obtained access to a larger set of surveys.
6
Those who regularly use the Internet can do so either at home or work, but much of the variation occurs because of
differences across states in home use.
7
State demographic characteristics include the proportion of the population who are white, female, married, ages 18
to 30, ages 30 to 50, ages 50 to 65, over age 65, and the share by years of education completed for those with less
than 12, 12, 13-15, 16, and 17-20

where β is the coefficient of interest and online penetration is a measure of annual average online
usage across states. These regressions show as online penetration grew across states so did the
use of each type of job search method. All methods show large, statistically significant increases
that coincide with the growth in Internet penetration across states and years: for example a stateyear with a 10 percentage point higher Internet penetration rate is associated with: a 2% increase
in the probability of sending out a resume, a 7% increase in the probability of looking at job ads,
a 10% increase in the probability of contacting a private employment agency, and a 1% increase
in contacting an employer. Summing all search methods shows that on average the unemployed
have used two of the methods queried and that a 10 percentage point higher Internet penetration
in a state-year is associated with an increase in the number of search methods of .07. All told,
the tremendous growth of the Internet—from 0 to 70%—over this period is associated with large
increases in search activities. Figure 2 showed that search increased both during the boom and
following the bust. A similar result is found by estimating the regressions shown in Column B
separately for the period before 2000 and after 2000.8
The analysis thus far considered variation coming from both the growth of the Internet
over time and from differences in that growth across states. In order to control for other trending
factors that might have also led to changes in job search behavior over time, we can instead
consider only the variation that comes from differences across states while controlling for the
aggregate trends through the inclusion of year fixed effects. Column C of Table 4 thus reports

8

Results are available from the author.

10

the results of estimating equation 1 with the inclusion of year fixed effects. While states vary in
the timing of growth in Internet penetration, this specification necessarily involves less variation
as it holds constant the aggregate growth in Internet penetration in a given year.

Not

surprisingly, many of the coefficient estimates are now imprecisely estimated—standard errors
triple or quadruple in most cases. The within-state variation yields a less clear story but suggests
that perhaps relative prices of the different search methods have changed.
Using variation in states’ adoption of the Internet over time raises questions about what is
driving the variation and with what else it might be correlated. For example, if people get access
to the Internet at home as a spill-over from firms adopting the Internet in their area then job
search activity may change along with Internet growth simply as a result of labor market changes
associated with industry technology adoption.

Similarly, states’ business cycles may drive

variation in the growth of Internet penetration, and thus, any relationship between Internet
growth and job search behavioral changes may simply reflect variation in regional business
cycles.
Stevenson (2007) addresses the first concern by comparing the adoption of the Internet
by consumers with that by firms and finds that while adoption by both consumers and firms has
occurred at a rapid pace, the adoption patterns have not been at all similar.9 The second concern
is partially addressed by the control variables; however, an alternative is to instrument for
Internet growth. Following Stevenson (2007), I use a linear combination of state ownership rates
of automatic washing machines and telephones in 1960 interacted with year effects to instrument
for online access. Automatic washing machine and telephone adoption rates in 1960 are a
powerful predictor of Internet penetration rates in 2000, as can be seen in Figure 3. While the

9

Data on commercial penetration refer to the measure of commercial participation developed in Forman, Goldfarb,
and Greenstein (2002).

11

characteristics in states that lead to these different adoption patterns might themselves be
correlated with employment outcomes, the fact that these characteristics have been stable over
the past 45 years suggests that the inclusion of state-fixed effects will control for this endogenous
relationship. Plausibly exogenous identification of states’ Internet growth rates comes from the
interaction of the fixed state characteristics predicting adoption and the annual average diffusion.
Columns D and E of Table 4 replace the OLS estimates in columns B and C with
instrumental variables estimates. The first stage uses the ownership rates of automatic washers
and telephones in the 1960s interacted with year fixed effects as a plausible exogenous predictor
for state online penetration growth, the results of which are shown in Appendix Table 1.
Instrumenting yields estimates that are qualitatively similar. As in column C, the specification
including year fixed effects is less precisely measured and, in most cases, we can reject neither a
zero effect, nor the large effects estimated in columns B and D. However, in both specifications
there is an economically and statistically significant increase in the number of search methods
used by the unemployed. Overall the IV regressions provide some suggestive evidence that the
Internet has led the unemployed to increase total job search activity at least at the extensive
margin, while it also led the unemployed to reallocate effort among various job search activities.

4. Employment Flows for Job Seekers
While the previous section explored the job search behavior of the unemployed, most
online job search is done by the currently employed. Unfortunately, data do not permit a similar
analysis for job search activities among the employed. However, the longitudinal component of
the CPS allows employment outcomes to be examined following the reporting of using the
Internet to search for employment. I followed all people who were employed in the August 2000

12

and September 2001 Supplements into the September 2000 and October 2001 monthly surveys,
respectively.10 The CPS (since 1994) employs a dependent interviewing technique in which
interviewees are read back their employment details from the preceding month and asked to
confirm them. These questions allow employment flows to be calculated including identifying
those who switched employers.
Table 5 shows the one-month employment flows of those employed in August 2000 and
September 2001 broken into those who had searched for a job online in the previous month and
those who had not. The first column reports results for the 88.7% who had not searched for a job
online in the preceding month: 93.3% are employed in the same job one month later, 2.7% are
employed with a new employer, 1.0% are unemployed, and 2.9% are no longer in the labor
force. The second column shows the employment flows for the 11.3% of workers who were
looking for a job online in the first month: 91.2% are employed in the same job one month later,
4.5% are employed with a new employer, 1.9% are unemployed, and 2.4% are no longer in the
labor force.
Comparing the first two columns in Table 5 reveals that those who were searching for a
job online were more likely to change jobs and more likely to become unemployed. However,
this comparison ignores the counterfactual of offline job search. To compare online on-the-job
search the counterfactual of any on-the-job search we turn to the February 2001 CPS Contingent
Worker Supplement.11 Workers in the February 2001 supplement are matched to the March
2001 CPS and their employment status one month later is shown in the third and fourth columns

10

While the survey is designed to be able to follow 75%, roughly only 95% of the 75% can actually be matched
from one month to the next. For more information on matching in the CPS see Madrian and Lefgren (1999).
Details about the match used in this paper are available from the author by request.
11
Fallick and Fleischman (2004) use the Contingent Worker Supplements to examine the difference in employer
flows for those who engage in offline on-the-job search. This table follows their examination in Table 6 of the 1997
& 1999 Contingent Worker Supplements.

13

of Table 5. The third column shows employment flows for the 94.4% of workers who were not
engaged in on-the-job search: 95.3% are employed in the same job one month later, 1.8% are
employed with a new employer, 0.9% are unemployed, and 2.0% are no longer in the labor
force. While these results are similar to those found for workers who had not engaged in online
on-the-job search, striking differences arise in the fourth column when examining employment
flows for the 5.6% of workers who were seeking a job the previous period.12 Among these
seekers, only 84.0% remained with their previous month’s employment, 9.1% were employed
with a new employer, 4.4% were unemployed, and 2.4% were no longer in the labor force.
More than twice as many workers engage in online on-the-job search compared with
traditional measures of search, however, a smaller percent of those engaging in on-the-job search
have left their employer one-month later compared with those engaging in traditional on-the-job
search. The outcomes for both online and traditional on-the-job seekers indicate that workers
who are searching for a new job while employed have a preference for changing jobs. They may
have personal reasons for wanting a change or have private (or at least unobservable to the
econometrician) information about the likelihood of their job continuing. Indeed, the large
percentage of those engaging in traditional on-the-job search who end up unemployed suggest
that some of these job seekers are adversely selected in that they are more likely to experience an
unemployment shock than is the average worker. This increased likelihood of unemployment is
also seen for the online on-the-job searchers, although to a smaller extent.
The difficulty with looking at workers who are searching online is that there is no direct
way to measure the counterfactual, what would have happened had they not been able to search
online. Indeed, while the previous comparison did not rule out online job search for those
12

The contingent worker surveys use similar definitions as the monthly CPS uses to assess unemployed job search
activity. The questions are not designed to capture method of action (for instance, emailing versus postal mailing of
resumes).

14

engaged in traditional job search it is not possible to identify those who are using the Internet to
search separately from those who are not. Ideally, one would want to measure both offline onthe-job search and Internet-based on-the-job search and compare employment outcomes for the
two groups. One way to get around this is simply to compare employment outcomes for those
who use the Internet with those who do not. To the extent that Internet use is itself uncorrelated
with the unobserved characteristics that cause on-the-job search (such as private information
about current match quality or personal preference to change jobs), then comparing employment
outcomes among Internet users with non-users (controlling for observables) will capture the
effect of the additional search induced by the Internet on employment outcomes. However, this
introduces a similar selection problem if those who use the Internet are more (less) likely to
change employers for reasons unrelated to the Internet, in this case the coefficient will be biased
upward (downward).
An additional benefit of comparing Internet users with non-users is that it captures the
total net effect of using the internet on employer-to-employer flows, regardless of whether a
worker perceives him or herself to be actively searching online (those who communicate by
email with a friend about a potential job lead and then submit applications online may very well
be more likely to change jobs as a result of the Internet, but may not answer “yes” to a survey
question regarding online job search).
To test whether Internet use is itself associated with a change in the probability of
changing employers, we follow workers in the 2001 and 2002 CPS Computer Use Supplements
and assess whether the probability of moving from one employer to another employer in the
subsequent month (EE) depends on Internet use in the previous month (I) controlling for
observed characteristics such as current age, age-squared, marital status, race, education, gender,

15

income, family type, industry and occupation, along with state and year fixed effects. That is,
probit regressions were run for:

∑s ηs States + ∑t λtYear + ε

(2)

where EE is a dummy variable equal to one if the worker changed employers in the subsequent
month, I is a dummy variable equal to one if the worker uses the Internet, and X is a vector of
demographic variables. The parameter of interest is β.
The regression results are reported in Table 6. Column 1 reports the results for the entire
sample of those who were employed in the Supplement surveys. The coefficient on Internet
represents the change in the probability for a discrete change from no Internet use to using the
Internet evaluated at the mean of the dependent variable. The coefficient evaluated at the
predicted mean implies that those who use the Internet are 15% more likely to have changed
employers the following month.
In addition to individual behavior, the CPS Computer and Internet Use Supplements ask
respondents about the use of computers and the Internet by anyone in the household. This allows
one to examine Internet use within households that have a computer and those that have Internet
access. Seventy-five percent of the employed in households with a computer use the Internet,
while 83% in households with Internet access do. The last two columns in Table 6 show
coefficients that are larger than, albeit not statistically different from, those shown in the first
column. Evaluating the effect of Internet use at the mean of the dependent variable shows that
Internet use is associated with a 28% increase in job changing among households with computers
and among households with Internet access. While the last two columns potentially reduce
selection problems at the household level, they also potentially exacerbate individual selection
issues.

16

This section illustrates that the Internet has the potential to affect worker flows in many
dimensions. While previous work by Kuhn and Skuterod (2004) showed little affect of the
Internet on unemployment duration, this finding relies on the assumption that the Internet had no
impact on the flow into unemployment. Stevenson (2007) examines employment flows more
fully considering that the Internet may have impacted employment-to-employment flows, as
shown here in Table 6, , as well as employment-to-unemployment flows and unemployment-toemployment flows. 13

5. Concluding Remarks
In the past ten years Internet usage has risen from effectively zero to 70% of the
population. This rapid rise in information technology has the potential to dramatically alter labor
market outcomes. The Internet is perceived to have made job search more efficient for workers,
yet research has lagged popular perception. This paper examines how job search activity has
changed in the wake of the Internet and traces out the effects of using the Internet to search for a
job while employed on employment outcomes one month later.
I find that over the past ten years the variety of job search methods used by the
unemployed has increased and job search behavior has become more extensive. Furthermore,
the Internet appears to have led to reallocation of effort among various job search activities. The
unemployed are now more likely to have looked at ads and to have contacted an employer
directly, however, there is some evidence the unemployed are becoming more selective about the
jobs to which they ultimately apply.

Perhaps not surprisingly, increasingly the amount of

information available about a given job allows the unemployed to better target their job search
13

Kuhn and Skuterod (2004) find unemployment durations for Internet job seekers that are similar, or perhaps
longer, than those not using the Internet to search for work. Stevenson (2007) finds that this partially reflects a
higher probability of an employment to employment spell without having a spell of unemployment.

activities.

While there is little evidence that the unemployed have experienced shorter

unemployment durations as a result, the Internet’s ability to reduce the cost of on-the-job search
may have changed the likelihood that a worker ends up unemployed.
The vast majority of workers using the Internet to gather information about employment
are those who are already employed. As such, the Internet potentially provides a large shock to
the re-matching market as those currently employed are better able to assess opportunities in the
marketplace. This research has shown that workers using the Internet are more likely to leave
their current employer and that, compared with traditional on-the-job search, online on-the-job
search may increase the rate at which employees change employers—at least in the short run.
Employees who are better calibrated about their outside options are not only more likely to
change employers, but they are in a better position to negotiate with their current employer.
Thus, future research should consider whether the Internet is affecting wage compression within
occupations.

Source: Online penetration numbers are from Forrester Research’s proprietary data where online is defined to be
“online at least 3 times in the last three months” from any location. State-year penetration numbers are calculated
from 5 years of survey data including retrospective data on how long the respondent had been online. For
example, state data for 1999 is calculated by combining current reports in 1999 and retrospective reports in 20002003. Data for 1992 and 1993 is interpolated following Goolsbee and Brown (2002): by scaling 1994 online
usage by the overall rate of growth of domain names. I applied their scaling to my estimates of 1994 online usage.

characteristics include the fraction of the state’s total population who are white, married, ages 18-30, ages 30-50, ages 50-65, over age 65, and the share by years of
education completed for those with high school, some college, college, and more than college. The percent of state workers in large firms is the percent of the employed
who work in a firm with more than 1,000 employees. The first stage of the IV is available in Appendix Table 1. The IV estimates online penetration each year as a
function of the year fixed effects interacted with the percent of a state that had telephones in 1960 and the year fixed effects interacted with the percent of a state that had
automatic washing machines in 1960. Sources: Job search data reflect annual data from 1994 through 2003 created from the monthly Current Population Statistics by
