NBER Working Paper No. 16845
March 2011
JEL No. E52,E58
ABSTRACT
The long-running debate about the role of monetary policy in responding to rising asset prices has
received renewed attention in the wake of the global financial crisis. This paper contributes to this
debate by describing the Australian experience of a cycle in house prices and credit from 2002 to 2004,
and discussing the role played by various policies during this episode. In particular, it focuses on the
efforts by the Reserve Bank of Australia to draw attention to the risks associated with large, ongoing
increases in housing prices and household borrowing.

POLICIES: AN AUSTRALIAN CASE STUDY

Introduction

The global financial crisis provided a stark reminder that large falls in asset prices
combined with high leverage can severely damage economies. In the United States,
which has been at the core of the financial crisis, house prices declined by
25–30 per cent between 2007 and 2009, ultimately contributing to the largest
decline in economic activity in over 60 years. Global exposure to the US economy
and a sharp decline in confidence was the catalyst for the first decline in global
GDP in the post-War period. In addition, house price declines in Ireland, Spain and
the United Kingdom contributed to a significant weakening of these economies.
Given the scale of the damage, it is not surprising that these events have
reinvigorated the long running debate about the role for policy in maintaining
financial stability, including whether or how monetary policy should respond to
changes in asset prices. 1
While much of the earlier debate focused on identification of asset-price bubbles
and whether monetary policy should respond to them, the debate appears to be
shifting towards how policy should respond to financial imbalances more broadly.
This reflects a growing recognition that asset price increases that are backed by a
substantial rise in leverage and a less prudent approach to risk management by
financial institutions can be dangerous. The global financial crisis has clearly
demonstrated that a policy of ‘cleaning up the mess’ after a collapse in asset prices
is problematic, especially if the collapse is associated with significant damage to
financial institutions. This strengthens the case for taking earlier action in order to
avoid a damaging correction later on.
Nonetheless, there is much debate about the appropriate nature of the policy
response along two broad strands. The first regards how much, if at all, monetary

and Goodhart (2010).

2
policy should act to stem financial cycle upswings. The second, and closely related
strand regards the scope for other policy instruments, such as so-called
macroprudential tools. This paper suggests that there is a need to shift debate away
from the extremes towards the question of the degree of policy intervention (or
‘leaning’) that is appropriate and the mix of policies that is likely to be effective in
maintaining stability of the macroeconomy.
Understanding the effectiveness of the various approaches is, however, hindered
by the limited experience of monetary or other policies being used explicitly to
respond to financial imbalances. 2 The few examples commonly cited include:
Hong Kong in the early 1990s, with controls on loan-to-valuation ratios (LVRs);
Spain’s adoption of dynamic provisioning from 2000; the response in Australia to
rapid growth of house prices and credit between 2002 and 2004, with a
combination of ‘open mouth operations’, a modest increase in policy rates and
some regulatory actions; and the Swedish experience using a similar approach in
response to rapid growth in house prices and credit between 2005 and 2007.
This paper provides a detailed case study of the Australian experience in the early
2000s. 3 Between 1997 and late 2003, housing prices in Australia more than
doubled, increasing by around 40 per cent over 2002 and 2003 alone. There was
also a rapid increase in housing credit (of 20 per cent per annum in 2002 and
2003), particularly for the purchase of residential investment properties. The boom
ended in late 2003, with national housing prices broadly flat over the subsequent
18 months (and falling in the two largest capital cities) and investor demand for
residential property easing significantly. This turnaround is an example where a
range of policies seemingly came together (albeit in a not explicitly coordinated
fashion) to ‘lean against’ emerging imbalances at a time when the growth in
residential property prices seemed inexorable.
In the five years following the 2003 turnaround, dwelling prices grew at around the
same pace as household disposable income and GDP growth averaged 3 per cent
per annum. Indeed, the early shake-out of the housing market may be one reason
why the Australian housing market and financial system were relatively well
2 Indeed, Greenspan (2010) claims that: ‘There are no examples, to my knowledge, of a
successful incremental defusing of a bubble that left prosperity in tact [sic]’ (p 45).

placed to weather the global financial crisis. Of course, the generally benign
outcome is also likely to have reflected a number of other factors. Among them,
Australia benefited from a large rise in the terms of trade starting around the time
that dwelling prices peaked. More generally, growth in the global economy was
very strong over the period from 2003 to 2007.
One important part of the policy response was a ‘public awareness campaign’ by
the Reserve Bank, highlighting the risks to households and the economy if the
existing trends in housing prices and borrowing continued (Macfarlane 2006). As
part of this campaign, from mid 2002 there were an increasing number of ‘open
mouth operations’ conducted by senior officials from the Reserve Bank. These
public statements were widely reported in the media, and intensified during the
period of most rapid growth in house prices. In addition, monetary policy was
tightened over this period; in mid 2002 there were two 25 basis point increases,
and then another two increases of the same amount in late 2003. While the
increases reflected broader macroeconomic developments, they were accompanied
by statements that expressed significant concern about the pace of credit growth
and housing price inflation, which could fuel imbalances if sustained.
During this episode, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)
publicly raised its concerns with banking institutions regarding housing lending
standards and undertook a detailed stress test of their housing loan portfolios. The
Australian Taxation Office (ATO) also took a stricter approach to enforcement of
housing-related tax laws. In addition, authorities took action against what appeared
to be fraudulent activity in the rapidly expanding property investment industry,
exposing and prosecuting agents of a prominent ‘get-rich-quick’ scheme.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the postfinancial crisis debate on asset prices and monetary policy, and the literature on the
policy responses to asset price upswings. Section 3 provides a brief history of
Australia’s experience with cycles in credit and asset prices and discusses events in
the Australian housing market in the early 2000s. Section 4 describes the range of
policy measures put in place in Australia between 2002 and 2004 in response to
rapid house price and credit growth, and examines the media response to the
Reserve Bank’s public awareness campaign. Section 5 concludes.

Asset Prices, Monetary and Other Policies

2.1

The Recent Debate

The weight of opinion prior to the global financial crisis was that central banks
should respond aggressively to the contractionary effects of sharp asset price falls
but not respond directly to asset prices during upswings (Issing 2009). 4 A
prominent advocate of this view was Alan Greenspan (former Chairman of the US
Federal Reserve System), who argued that identifying a bubble with a degree of
certainty was not possible and that any pre-emptive policy response would likely
be destabilising. Rather, central banks should pick up the pieces afterwards
(Greenspan 2002, 2004, 2010). 5 However, the global financial crisis demonstrated
that the cost of an asset price and credit market collapse may be large enough to
warrant paying some short-term cost to avoid or contain it. As such, there is now
less focus on whether policy should respond and much more attention being paid to
which policies should respond and by how much (Bean 2009, Trichet 2009). 6
There are two broad views on how this should be done. On the one hand, there are
those who see a greater role for monetary policy to stem excessive financial cycle
upswings. On the other hand, there are those of the view that monetary policy
should play a minimal role, but that the policy framework more generally is
inadequate and in need of reform. In particular, there has been renewed interest in
additional policy instruments – macroprudential tools – often motivated by the
argument that multiple objectives (price and financial stability) require multiple
instruments (Tinbergen 1952).7 Both streams typically accept the arguments that:
better enforcement of existing regulations is required; some regulatory reform may

4 For a summary of the state of the literature prior to the global financial crisis see Hunter,
Kaufman and Pomerleano (2003), Richards and Robinson (2003) and Cecchetti (2006).
5 See Borio, Furfine and Lowe (2001) and Bordo and Jeanne (2002) for a discussion of the
moral hazard problems associated with this asymmetric approach to policy.
6 Despite the costs of the recent crisis, some still argue (along established lines) that monetary
policy should not respond to asset prices (Kohn 2008, Posen 2009 and Greenspan 2010).
7 Fischer (2010) notes that this principle only applies when the objective is strict in the sense
that it must be satisfied over a relatively short horizon.

5
be beneficial 8 ; and that reforms should not unduly impinge upon efficiency, nor
simply push credit provision outside of the regulatory net.
For those who see a greater role for monetary policy, a number of different
approaches have been suggested. One possibility – and the focus of earlier work –
is that asset prices could be: added to the central bank’s target by including them in
the consumer price index; or incorporated in Taylor-type rules and explicitly
referred to in the central bank’s mandate (Bryan, Cecchetti and O’Sullivan 2003
and Cecchetti, Genberg and Wadhwani 2003). There are arguments against this,
not least that it is difficult to know exactly which asset prices should be included,
as well as the fact that mechanical approaches have difficulty distinguishing what
might be relatively sustainable increases in asset prices (Goodhart and
Hofmann 2002). Others emphasise that large rises in asset prices are more likely to
be problematic when accompanied by rapid growth in credit and declining lending
standards. 9 Proponents of this view argue that a central bank could use its
judgement about low frequency movements in a range of variables (not unlike the
case of more standard monetary policy decisions) to motivate ‘leaning against’
emerging financial imbalances. In this regard, concerns should mostly be about
growth rates (rather than levels) of key variables, such as asset prices or credit, for
a number of reasons. First, it is hard to know what constitutes a sustainable or
fundamental level of such variables. Second, while high levels of indebtedness, for
example, may imply greater vulnerability to adverse shocks, rapid growth may also
suggest that individual, as well as system-wide, risks have not been fully
appreciated, and that a larger share of exposures have yet to be tested by a period
of economic weakness. Third, monetary policy cannot hope to be concerned with
the level of a particular variable, such as property prices, but by altering the price
of credit it can influence the willingness to service existing debts and to take on
new ones.

8 This may include measures that better account for the contribution of individual financial
institutions to systemic risks (Bank of England 2009, Squam Lake Working Group on
Financial Regulation 2009 and Caruana 2010).
9 A number of empirical papers suggest that there is a role for variables such as money, credit
and/or asset prices (particularly property prices) in providing an early indication of emerging
financial imbalances that will threaten financial stability. See, for example, Borio and
Lowe (2002), Borio and White (2004), Detken and Smets (2004), ECB (2005) and Borio and
Drehmann (2009). Inclusion of a monetary aggregate target as one of the two pillars of
monetary policy by the European Central Bank constitutes a related approach.

6
Counterarguments to a pre-emptive monetary policy approach are numerous (see
Bernanke 2002, Greenspan 2002 and Gruen, Plumb and Stone 2005, for example).
There are those who argue that asset price changes may be fundamentally based
and the associated higher leverage sustainable, so policy should not resist them.
And even if it is possible to identify a bubble with some confidence, others argue
that countering it with monetary policy would require such an aggressive response
that the cost to the ‘non-bubble’ sectors of the economy would be too high. Some
suggest that trying to end an asset price boom late in the piece might in fact make
things worse. Finally, the use of monetary policy for this purpose may be difficult
to explain given central banks’ current mandates. Hence, if CPI inflation is
contained, new and more targeted ‘macroprudential’ policies may be preferred.
More recent discussion has focused on these macroprudential policies, which could
serve as either substitutes for, or complements to, monetary policy. 10 These
policies involve targeting the incentives and ability of lenders to extend credit. A
number of instruments have been widely discussed, including dynamic
provisioning, which involves setting aside provisions for expected – rather than
actual – losses, direct controls on loan-to-valuation ratios and, more recently,
directly linking regulatory capital to credit and asset price developments.11 One
advantage of these measures is that they target the problem of rapidly increasing
financial system leverage. A key disadvantage is that they may drive the more
risky behaviour outside of the regulatory net. The US subprime crisis provided an
example of this, with a large build up of risk in the ‘shadow banking system’ prior
to the crisis eventually putting severe strain on the banking system proper. And
while it may be possible to bring the existing ‘shadow banking system’ under the
regulatory umbrella, it is unlikely that new regulation could circumvent regulatory
arbitrage over the longer term. Indeed, financial innovation is often focused on
ways to get around the regulatory net. Furthermore, in a globalised financial
system, regulatory arbitrage may involve financial participants moving across
borders, complicating the domestic policy options, and necessitating international
cooperation.

10 Brunnermeier et al (2009), Fatás et al (2009), FSF (2009) and Haldane (2009).
11 FSF (2009) discusses these instruments. See also, Borio et al (2001), Borio and Lowe (2004)
and Griffith-Jones, Ocampo and Ortiz (2009).

7
As with monetary policy, some suggest that macroprudential instruments could be
subject to a rule (say for LVRs or capital requirements) based on the behaviour of
particular macro variables, such as asset prices or credit (Goodhart and
Persaud 2008 and Posen 2009, for example). 12 Others highlight the importance of
discretion on the part of policy-makers given the high degree of uncertainty
surrounding the most effective approach to combating any particular imbalance
(Tucker 2009). 13 Many of the same issues about rules versus discretion in
monetary policy are equally applicable to the discussion concerning
macroprudential instruments.
In summary, while regulatory overhaul has been the main focus of recent policy
discussions, debate about the appropriate role of monetary policy has also
intensified. The apparent pre-crisis consensus of benign neglect has softened, with
increased interest in approaches which involve monetary policy leaning against
emerging imbalances to some extent. However, exactly how such imbalances are
to be identified remains problematic and it is likely that a significant amount of
judgement is required. This is not surprising given that, despite many important
similarities, every financial crisis is different from the last in crucial and
unexpected ways.
2.2

International Policy Responses – Some Examples

A key argument against the leaning-against-the-wind approach is that policymakers are unlikely to be able to reverse or even slow the course of asset prices
during an upswing, at least without causing substantial damage to other parts of the
economy. This argument is difficult to assess because there are only a few

12 See Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2007), Borio and Drehmann (2009), Fatás et al (2009),
Gerdesmeier, Reimers and Roffia (2009) and Kannan, Rabanal and Scott (2009a) for
discussion of the problems associated with the use of a composite indicator in this regard.
13 This is supported by recent empirical work (such as Kannan, Rabanal and Scott 2009b, Gruss
and Sgherri 2009 and N’Diaye 2009), which finds a role for (simple) macroprudential
instruments in augmenting monetary policy but stresses the need for discretion in the
implementation and application of such instruments.

8
examples of countries that have explicitly used monetary or prudential policies to
slow asset price growth. In what follows, we review three commonly cited cases. 14
2.2.1 Hong Kong
Restrictions on land supply between 1984 and 1997, and the peg to the US dollar
via a currency board, meant that Hong Kong was particularly vulnerable to boombust cycles in the housing market. Around 1990, as China became more open to
investment and trade from Hong Kong, property prices surged. Between 1989 and
1992, residential property prices rose by around 30 per cent per annum on average
in Hong Kong (Figure 1). The high concentration of residential loans on the books
of Hong Kong’s banks (40 per cent of total loans) meant that a rapid reversal of
such strong price growth was a sizeable risk for the banking system.
In May 1991, the Hong Kong Commissioner of Banking urged financial
institutions to tighten lending standards and lower the proportion of net worth that
could be lent. Some institutions adopted self-imposed LVR ceilings, but by
November 1991 there was little indication that credit growth was slowing and so
institutions were asked to take further action. A number of the major banks
lowered their LVR ceilings to 70 per cent (from around 80 to 90 per cent), which
saw housing credit growth slow substantially from the December quarter 1991. 15
The effectiveness of these restrictions in helping to maintain financial stability was
tested in 1994 when interest rates increased in line with the US fed funds rate,
ending Hong Kong’s asset price boom. Although housing prices fell 25 per cent
from their peak over the next 18 months, mortgage losses remained below
0.5 per cent of assets and bank profits rose in 1995 (McCauley, Ruud and
Iacono 1999). 16

14 Another case is Japan’s use of tax and land supply policies, as well as caps on lending to real
estate industries in the late 1980s in response to a real estate boom between 1987 and 1989.
However, the subsequent large decline in land prices and associated problems provide some
evidence that these policies were implemented too late (see Okina, Shirakawa and
Shiratsuka 2001 for a discussion of this point and Ito and Iwaisako 1995 for details on the
episode).
15 Other initiatives about this time included a 60 per cent LVR ceiling for luxury properties and
a recommended ceiling on the growth rate of mortgage portfolios of 15 per cent per annum.
16 See Mo and Leechor (1998) for detailed coverage of this episode.

Regulatory controls in Hong Kong have been applied in a flexible way, first by the
Commissioner of Banking and then by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA). Also, regulations have evolved with the financial system. For example,
maximum LVRs were increased to incorporate the use of lenders’ mortgage
insurance (LMI) (Yam 2009). The banking system has been stable despite
significant house price volatility. Even during the Asian financial crisis of
1997–1998, banks remained resilient (Gerlach and Peng 2005). More recently,
rising asset prices due to low interest rates once again increased concern about a
potential boom in credit and asset prices in late 2009. In response, the HKMA
decreased the maximum LVR on luxury properties (HK$20 million and above) to
60 per cent.
Hong Kong is commonly cited as an example of the successful use of
macroprudential policies in the face of financial imbalances, although the nature of
its housing market and financial system means that its experience is somewhat
unique.

10
2.2.2 Spain
Between 1995 and 2000, credit extended to households in Spain grew at an
average annual rate of 18 per cent. This strong growth followed, in part, from the
reduction in interest rates (due to entry into the euro area) as well as increased
competition, which led to an erosion of lending standards; at the same time,
specific provisions had declined along with the fall in non-performing loans
(Griffith-Jones et al 2009). In response, the Bank of Spain implemented a system
of dynamic loan-loss provisions in 2000, 17 which forced financial institutions to
recognise the risk of loan loss when loans entered the balance sheet, rather than
once loans became impaired. 18 The approach was intended to help reduce the
volatility of credit growth and profits over the business cycle by increasing the cost
to banks of making increasingly risky loans as asset prices rose, and providing
them with buffers to protect their balance sheets once prices fell and nonperforming loans increased.
The scheme was significantly scaled back in 2005 as a result of a conflict with the
International Accounting Standards Board conventions (adopted by the EU);
although, provisions still account for about 1.9 per cent of consolidated assets of
Spanish depository institutions, compared with total equity of about 8.3 per cent
(Bank of Spain 2010). Griffith-Jones et al (2009) suggest that there is little
evidence that the practice of dynamic provisioning has reduced the amplitude of
the credit or house price cycle in Spain, with average annual growth in both
measures well above the recent historical average between 2000 and 2005 when
the dynamic provisioning scheme was in effect. However, Saurina (2009) indicates
that much of the pool of provisions amassed since the scheme’s inception was
drawn on over the course of 2009, supporting financial institutions during the
global financial crisis. Overall though, it is perhaps too early to tell the extent to
which the use of this policy instrument in Spain was successful in maintaining
financial stability.

17 See Caruana (2005), Griffith-Jones et al (2009) and Saurina (2009).
18 For a detailed discussion of dynamic provisioning, see Fernández de Lis, Pagés and
Saurina (2000) and Caruana (2005).

11
2.2.3 Sweden
Perhaps the policy response most similar to the Australian experience was that of
the Riksbank between 2005 and 2007.19 During this period, housing prices and
housing credit increased by 11 and 13 per cent per annum on average, respectively.
At the same time, the Riksbank raised its policy rate by 200 basis points and
publicised its concerns about the sustainability of the expansion and the
implications of a sharp house price correction for the financial system and broader
economy. In 2005, six of the seven media statements released following policy
decisions flagged concerns about developments in asset prices and household
credit (Hoerova et al 2009), and in 2006 the policy rate was increased with
concerns about rapidly rising house prices and household indebtedness referred to
in the policy statement.20 The Riksbank was criticised for its approach. In a report
commissioned by the Swedish Parliament, Giavazzi and Mishkin (2006) suggested
that it was a mistake for policy to consider developments beyond those relevant to
CPI inflation. More recently, however, Hoerova et al (2009) contend that the
policy tightening, when combined with public announcements about the dangers of
the housing market boom, helped to moderate the financial upswing.

Asset Prices and Credit Cycles in Australia

3.1

Key Features of Australia’s Earlier Financial Cycles

Australia has a long history of cycles in both asset prices and credit. Four episodes
stand out as having had some degree of financial system instability and an
economic slowdown. At the core of these episodes was a boom and bust in the
property market centred on the early 1890s, early 1930s, mid 1970s and late
1980s/early 1990s. 21 Despite their similarities, there were substantial differences
19 See Nyberg (2005), Giavazzi and Mishkin (2006) and Hoerova, Monnet and
Temzelides (2009). The banking crisis in Sweden in 1990, which followed a boom in credit
and property prices in the late 1980s, required the Government to take a large equity share in
the banks. The fact that this severe episode was in the living memory of bankers and policymakers may have contributed to the approach taken to the housing boom of the mid 2000s.
20 See, for example, http://www.riksbank.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=20017.
21 For a detailed comparison of these episodes see Kent and D’Arcy (2000) and
Kent (forthcoming). Simon (2003) provides a broad discussion of booms and busts in
Australian asset markets.

12
across these episodes in terms of the extent of damage done to the financial system
during the phase of declining asset prices. These differences can in the main be
traced back to the strength of competitive pressures, the prudence of financial
institutions and the decline in lending standards during the expansionary phases.
The most extreme cycle, and the most damaging, lay behind the 1890s depression.
The expansionary phase was underpinned by a sharp rise in competitive pressures
among financial institutions, which encouraged an easing in lending standards and
rapid growth of credit, much of which was channelled into the booming property
market. The eventual downturn in the property market led to a severe financial
crisis and a depression unequalled in Australia’s experience. In stark contrast,
Australia’s financial system was relatively stable during the 1930s depression,
notwithstanding a pronounced cycle in property prices. The cycle in credit was
substantial but somewhat muted compared with the 1890s, helped in part by less
intensive competitive pressures and more prudent behaviour by the banks. In turn,
this reflected the change in market structure since the 1890s crisis and the memory
of that disastrous episode.
The credit and property price cycle of the mid 1970s was spurred on by rising
competition from an emerging fringe of non-bank financial institutions, while
banks remained tightly constrained by regulations. There was a pronounced cycle
in commercial property, ultimately leading to the failure of almost half of the
largest 20 finance companies. However, high levels of debt were less problematic
because much of the correction in real property prices occurred via relatively rapid
generalised inflation.
The cycle in credit and property prices of the late 1980s/early 1990s was driven by
improving economic conditions and easier lending standards, which followed from
financial deregulation in the 1980s. Businesses were the main recipients of the
more readily available credit. A lot of reliance was placed on property as collateral.
Not surprisingly then, the large rise in corporate gearing was associated with a
boom in the commercial property market. Sydney office prices more than doubled
between 1986 and 1989 but fell sharply thereafter to levels seen around seven
years earlier (Figure 2). The October 1987 stock market crash had little impact on
the commercial property market (or the economy more generally). It was not until
interest rates were increased substantially that commercial property prices began to

13
decline, with adverse effects on financial institutions and the economy more
broadly. Eventually, two of Australia’s largest banks experienced sizeable losses
and had to issue more equity. The early 1990s recession was long lasting, in large
part because of the substantial financial headwinds (Macfarlane 2006).
Importantly, this event was in the living memory of bankers and policy-makers
during the 2000s boom in housing prices and household credit.

Housing Market Developments in the Early 2000s

In contrast to these earlier episodes, the large run-up in housing prices and rapid
growth of credit in the early 2000s was followed by a levelling out in housing
prices for a few years, with little if any adverse impact on the financial system
overall. Between 1997 and 2003, dwelling prices in Australia doubled (growing by
an average of 13 per cent per annum). Growth was particularly rapid towards

14
the end of this period, with median dwelling prices rising by an average of
18 per cent per annum in 2002 and 2003. 22 Dwelling price growth significantly
outpaced growth in household disposable income, with the nationwide dwellingprice-to-income ratio rising from around 2½ in the mid 1990s to a little over 3 by
2001 and then to 4½ at its peak in early 2004 (Figure 3). 23 In late 2003, nationwide
dwelling prices levelled out. Over the subsequent 18 months, capital city dwelling
prices were broadly flat, though they fell in some key areas, particularly in western
Sydney. Thereafter, nationwide dwelling prices grew at about the same pace as
disposable income, with the price-to-income ratio trending down slightly before
dipping during the financial crisis and rebounding more recently. The household
debt-to-income ratio has also been broadly stable since 2006.

22 The rise in dwelling prices between 1997 and 2003 was broadly based, albeit with different
timing and intensity across regions – stronger earlier in the larger cities of Sydney and
Melbourne (which together account for around 40 per cent of the national dwelling stock),
and more rapid in the smaller capital cities in 2002 and 2003.
23 The capital cities dwelling-price-to-income ratio presented here is biased upwards as the
income measure includes regional areas, which typically have lower incomes than the capital
cities. The nationwide measure is lower, though not available for the earlier history. In
Australia, around 60 per cent of the value of the housing stock is located in the capital cities.

There were many factors which contributed to the prolonged housing price
appreciation. Most were associated with structural changes that supported a rise in
household indebtedness and greater demand for housing.24 These included:
x The effects of the move to a low and stable inflation environment through the
early 1990s. Lenders in Australia had frequently determined borrowing capacity
24 Kent, Ossolinski and Willard (2007) discuss these trends across a range of economies.

16
according to a rule of thumb whereby initial repayments were no more than
some fixed share of borrowers’ income, typically around 30 per cent of gross
income (Stevens 1997; RBA 2003a). By reducing nominal interest rates, lower
inflation worked to ease this constraint by reducing initial repayments. Real
interest rates also fell after lower inflation was secured, which helped to reduce
the real costs of funds for institutions.
x Rising competitive pressures (following financial market deregulation) and
innovations which reduced the costs and increased the availability of credit.
Mortgage interest rate margins were compressed significantly, by about
160 basis points over the second half of the 1990s (Figure 4). Innovations in
securitisation enabled traditional banking institutions to broaden their funding
base and provided low cost funding for unregulated lenders employing an
‘originate-to-distribute’ business model. These changes supported an easing in
lending standards including via the introduction of new types of loans.
x A more favourable tax treatment for investors in housing. While Australia’s tax
arrangements have long been favourable to investors, in September 1999 the
Federal Government significantly reduced the capital gains tax rate
(RBA 2003b). 25 Although the rental yields were relatively low thereafter
(Figure 5), the net cash flow position of households investing in rental properties
was enhanced by the tax treatment of investment-related expenses.

25 From September 1999, half of the capital gain from assets held for at least a year became
exempt from tax; prior to this, taxes were assessed according to real capital gains (based on
the CPI). The taxpayers’ main residence is exempt from capital gains tax, although interest
payments are not tax deductible.

Assessing the extent to which the upswing in housing prices reflected fundamental
factors is not easy. Most time-series modelling approaches seek to identify a stable
long-run relationship, but this is notoriously difficult, particularly at times of
significant structural change. However, given that housing prices had already
increased substantially over a number of years, the pace of growth in 2002 and
2003 appeared to be unsustainable. 26 Indeed, much of the increased demand for
housing and finance came from investors (as opposed to owner-occupiers). By
2003, nearly 45 per cent of all new housing loans were for investment purposes,
26 Analysis similar to that of Borio and Lowe (2002) (and updated by Borio and
Drehmann 2009) using measures of the deviation of credit-to-GDP and house prices from
real-time trends, suggests that such ‘gap’ indicators breached the threshold values (posited by
Borio and Lowe) around 2002–2003. Hence, imbalances that have historically been associated
with financial crises were present in the period of interest. However, the results of this
approach are quite sensitive to the choice of smoothing parameters, which would likely limit
its usefulness as a way of gauging imbalances for application in a rule-based approach to
policy.

compared to around 25 per cent over the four years prior to 2003, and an even
lower share prior to this (Figure 4). This was despite very low rental yields,
providing some evidence that investors were motivated by expectations of after-tax
returns due to capital gains rather than the current investment income (Figure 5).

Financial innovations had encouraged investors into the housing market. Lending
criteria on investor loans became easier from around 1996 as they moved into line
with those that applied to owner-occupiers. Along with the removal of the interest
rate penalty on investor loans (of about 1 percentage point in the mid 1990s), lowequity and interest-only loans became readily available. Also, new products – such
as deposit bonds – allowed investors to purchase off-the-plan properties with no
cash outlay upfront and with only small outlays to finance ongoing costs. At about
the same time, a number of non-financial companies began to promote investment
in residential property. It was ‘not uncommon … for promoters … to suggest that
due to the operation of the tax system, investors [could] purchase an investment
property worth $400,000 or $500,000 for as little as $50 per week’ (RBA 2003b,
p 39).

19
Broader macroeconomic conditions were also conducive to rising household
indebtedness as Australia’s economy fared well through the global downturn of
2001, growing at an average rate of 4 per cent from 2001–2003. Initially this
resilience reflected Australia’s low production of information technology, and later
was partly due to strength in the housing market and the effect of this on
consumption. Australia’s unemployment rate rose through 2001, though only back
to levels of a year earlier, and by 2003 it was back down to around 6 per cent.
Against the background of a robust economy, housing credit growth picked up
significantly. From an average of 14 per cent per annum from 1998–2001, it
stepped up in 2002 and then again in 2003 to 21 per cent, significantly faster than
the growth of household disposable income. Moreover, investor activity accounted
for much of this growth. Household surveys (which became available only with
some delay) suggest that the proportion of households owning investor or second
homes rose from 16 per cent in 2002 to 20 per cent by 2006. The increase in
household debt saw the household interest burden rise to new highs (although it
has subsequently surpassed this level). It also increased the exposure of the
financial system to the housing market, with housing credit rising from around
40 per cent of total credit in 1997 to 55 per cent in early 2005.
Over this period, there was little evidence that overall supply was running either
substantially behind underlying demand (which would have supported dwelling
prices) or ahead of underlying demand (which would have pushed down prices).27
While there was a sharp pick-up in construction of apartment buildings, and a
significant push by property developers to sell these apartments to investors, there
were few signs of broader excess housing supply, with rental vacancy rates
returning to around average levels after peaking in 2002 (Figure 5). Any overbuilding was fairly localised, with approvals for high-rise residential buildings
rising sharply over 2002; by 2003 this had contributed to some fears of overbuilding in this segment of the market. Dwelling investment rose to above average
in 2003, at 6½ per cent of GDP, though the introduction of a goods and services
tax in 2000 – which added volatility into the housing construction measures –
makes it difficult to assess how much of the run-up in dwelling investment in
2002–2003 was payback for earlier weakness.
27 Estimates of underlying demand can be calculated using data on population growth, average
household size and the number of vacant dwellings (including holiday houses, etc).

20
Housing market activity started to ease in October 2003 and growth of capital city
dwelling prices overall stopped in the last two months of 2003 (Figures 6 and 7).
They then remained broadly steady for about 18 months, though prices fell in
Sydney and Melbourne. While reliable monthly housing price indicators were not
available at the time, subsequent improvements allow us to confirm the timing of
the easing in housing prices. Even so, timely data on auction markets were
available (around 15 per cent of all residential sales occur at auction in Australia,
though this varies substantially across cities), and auction clearance rates (the
number of auctions resulting in a sale relative to auctions that take place) have a
strong correlation with monthly housing price growth (of 0.9 on a nationwide
basis). These rates declined in October 2003 and fell substantially to reach levels
of previous troughs by June 2004. 28

28 Measures of consumer sentiment regarding whether it is a ‘good time to buy a dwelling’ also
fell sharply in December quarter 2003, after having taken a step down in 2002 from earlier
very high levels, due to rising interest rates and falling affordability.

After 2003

Housing prices fell for a period through 2004 in both Sydney and Melbourne.
Large declines were apparent in the suburbs in western Sydney, where house prices
fell by between 5 and 20 per cent (Figure 8). This part of Sydney accounts for
about 6 per cent of the national housing stock and tends to have lower-priced
housing than much of Sydney; prices also peaked later than in the rest of Sydney.
A significant number of late entrants into the housing market in western Sydney
had loans with high LVRs and low documentation. Also, mortgage originators (as
opposed to banking institutions) comprised a greater share of new lending in this

22
region than in others and, partly through looser lending standards, were able to
increase their market share. Accordingly, western Sydney was the region of
Australia that exhibited the most substantial rise in housing loan arrears and
mortgage defaults, with an arrears rate considerably higher than the average arrears
rate for loans in other parts of Sydney.

From 2004 until 2007, housing prices nationwide grew broadly in line with
household disposable incomes and housing credit growth slowed considerably,
especially for investors. Rents, which had previously not grown very strongly,
picked up and there was an upward trend in the rental yield, consistent with low
rental vacancy rates and a relative decline in home building. The shake-out of the
housing market also had implications for financial institutions’ balance sheets.
On-balance sheet arrears for banks rose gradually and reached a local maximum of
around 0.5 per cent of housing loans in early 2007, though they subsequently rose
a little further largely due to increasing interest rates. Arrears rates on securitised
housing loans rose earlier, by more and to a higher level, partly reflecting the
larger share of low-documentation loans in the securitised pool.

23
The rise in housing loan arrears was eventually reflected in more widespread
concerns about lending practices and some additional tightening in lending
standards, although pinpointing the timing and extent of this is hindered by data
limitations. 29 Periodic surveys of banks and data on the characteristics of
securitised mortgages provide some information in this regard, though these
provide only a partial view due to significant shifts in the market share of mortgage
lenders. Available evidence suggests that lending standards tightened after housing
prices declined, albeit with considerable delay. Eventually, a parliamentary inquiry
was held on ‘Home Lending Practices and Processes’ in August 2007, with
submissions from a range of institutions including the Reserve Bank, APRA and
the lenders’ mortgage insurance (LMI) providers. Australia’s largest LMI provider,
Genworth Financial, noted a number of areas in which insurance companies could
help to ensure prudent lending practices, including detailed underwriting
guidelines for high LVR loans, procedures to verify property valuations, and
scoring techniques to identify high-risk loans (Genworth Financial 2007).

Australian Policy Developments

This section summarises the statements by, and actions of, the relevant policy
authorities, including the Reserve Bank, in the period from 2002 to 2004 in
response to housing market developments. This is based on an examination of
public statements. For the Bank, these include the quarterly Statement on Monetary
Policy (SMP), statements to parliamentary committees, 30 media releases related to
policy announcements and speeches by senior Bank officials. A detailed summary
of these statements is provided in Appendix A. It is also worth noting that over this
period, the Bank devoted considerable resources to the analysis and research of
trends in Australian housing prices and housing finance. This included a careful
comparison with developments in a range of other relevant economies. The results
of these efforts were released in a number of articles, including an extensive

24
submission by the Bank to the Productivity Commission Inquiry on First Home
Ownership (RBA 2003b). 31
While the wider debate surrounding the role of monetary policy in responding to
asset prices was particularly vigorous in this period, these issues had been under
consideration by the Reserve Bank for some time. In the late 1990s and early
2000s, the Bank released a number of papers dealing with issues of asset-price
bubbles, credit cycles and episodes of financial instability. Some provided an
examination of Australia’s historical experiences of financial instability, while
others undertook more abstract analysis using a more structured framework. 32 The
broad conclusion was that rapid growth in asset prices and leverage, accompanied
by declining lending standards, can pose a risk to financial and macroeconomic
stability more generally. This was echoed by a number of participants at the
Reserve Bank’s 2003 conference on asset prices and monetary policy (Richards
and Robinson 2003).
4.1

Policies and Discussions

As the previous Section describes, there were fundamental factors underpinning
the rise in housing prices over the second half of the 1990s and the early 2000s in
Australia. However, developments in 2002 and 2003 began to cause some unease
for policy-makers, as the pace of growth in housing prices and credit were
accelerating to very rapid rates and there were signs that lending standards were
declining in a number of important respects. The very prominent role of investors
in the housing market also suggested a strong speculative element.
The broad approach of the Reserve Bank can be summarised as follows. The Bank
attempted to draw attention to the longer-term risks associated with recent trends,
especially the high rates of growth of housing prices and housing credit. In
31 This type of analysis and research continued beyond 2003. For example, in 2004 the Bank, in
conjunction with private sector firms and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, made
considerable effort to develop robust and timely measures of housing prices (see the
July 2004 RBA Bulletin, Hansen 2006 and Prasad and Richards 2006), many of which are
used in this paper.
32 For detailed consideration of Australia’s historical experience with asset-price bubbles see
Kent and D’Arcy (2000) and Kent (forthcoming). For a more theoretical approach regarding
the case for monetary policy to act against asset prices ex-ante, see Kent and Lowe (1997a,
1997b). Gruen et al (2005) highlight arguments against pre-emptive action.

25
particular, the Bank drew attention to the fact that it was unlikely that these trends
were sustainable over the medium term, and that borrowers entering the market
based on expectations that prices would continue to rise at a rapid rate were taking
a significant risk, particularly if highly leveraged. Similarly, the Bank drew
attention to the risks associated with declining lending standards. During the
period, monetary policy continued to be set on the basis of medium-term prospects
for inflation and output and the Bank was not targeting housing prices or credit
growth. However, developments in the housing market were an important factor in
the Bank not delaying a tightening of monetary policy that was likely to be
required on more general macroeconomic grounds. 33 The Bank’s explanations of
its monetary policy decisions also highlighted the risks in the housing market.
The Reserve Bank started raising concerns about housing market developments in
early 2002. Between 2002 and late 2003 there was a clear progression of themes
relating to housing price and credit growth in Bank statements as it endeavoured to
use ‘open mouth operations’ to draw attention to the risks. While the approach to
the housing market developments could not be described as an explicitly
coordinated strategy, regulatory agencies and governing bodies also provided
pointed discussion of market developments and took some regulatory actions. 34 In
2002/03, APRA undertook a comprehensive stress test of the resilience of housing
lending portfolios of banking institutions, which led subsequently to a tightening of
prudential capital requirements for non-standard loans and for lender’s mortgage
insurers. Federal taxation authorities sought to better enforce the tax code relating
33 Combination forecasts from a suite of macroeconomic forecasting models (using the current
vintage of data and current parameter estimates) confirm this. The central tendency of the
cash rate projections from the models suggested gradual increases in the cash rate from
around mid 2002 and late 2003. The increase in rates in May and June 2002 left the cash rate
about 30 basis points above the median combination forecast around that time. Similarly, the
increases in November and December 2003 left the cash rate about 35 basis points above the
median forecast around that time. For a discussion of the combination forecasts, see Gerard
and Nimark (2008). Jääskelä and Nimark (2008) describe the DSGE model used in the suite; a
fourth ‘Minnesota VAR’ model has also been included.
34 The Council of Financial Regulators (CFR), which has representatives from APRA, ASIC and
the Federal Treasury and is chaired by the Reserve Bank Governor, provides a formal link
between these institutions. There is evidence in the CFR’s Annual Report, published in
September 2003, of growing concerns about the housing market, particularly that the
‘exceptionally fast increase in borrowing for investor housing has clearly increased risk and
that the accompanying rapid expansion in apartment building shows all the signs of a
seriously over-extended market’ (CFR 2003, p 19).

26
to deductions stemming from investment properties, and state governments
tightened regulations regarding the conduct of auctions. The Australian Securities
and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission (ACCC) also played a role by investigating alleged illegal
activities by a number of property marketers.
4.1.1 Developments in 2002
Prior to 2002, housing price developments were often discussed by the Reserve
Bank in the context of positive wealth effects, as the domestic economy attempted
to shrug off the headwinds associated with slow global growth. As the recovery
gained momentum domestically, the focus turned to the possibility of overbuilding
in some segments of the medium-density housing market, and to the question of
the risks associated with rapid growth in credit and house prices.
The Bank tightened monetary policy in May 2002 and again in June (by 25 basis
points on each occasion) (Figure 9). In explaining the Bank’s general strategy, the
May 2002 SMP highlighted that while inflation was expected to ease to around the
middle of the target through 2002, inflationary pressures were expected to pick up
over the course of 2003 as the economy strengthened. The Bank, however, also
suggested that low rates risked fuelling imbalances associated with a strong rise in
house prices and household borrowing over a number of years. For example, in the
statement accompanying the May 2002 monetary policy decision it was noted that:
To persist with a strongly expansionary policy setting … could fuel other
imbalances such as the current overheating in the housing market, potentially
jeopardising the economy’s continued expansion. (RBA Media Release – 8 May
2002)

While the structural shift in the availability of housing finance and macroeconomic
conditions more generally justified strong growth in house prices in the late 1990s
and early 2000s, low interest rates and tax arrangements were encouraging
investors and subsidies were boosting first-home buyer demand. Poor returns on
alternative investments in the wake of the dot-com bust were also emphasised
(Macfarlane 2002b, Stevens 2002). Further, the Bank noted that: 35
… whenever [a structural shift] of this type occurs, there is the risk that prices may
overshoot, as some purchasers extrapolate past movements as a guide to future
capital gains. This may be occurring at present, since the low rental yield on
property, and high rental vacancy rates, seem inconsistent with rapidly rising house
prices. (SMP – May 2002, pp 31–32)

35 See also Macfarlane (2002b, 2002c) and the July 2002 RBA Bulletin.

28
This line of argument continued throughout 2002 with the clear goal of
highlighting the risks:
… the potential for further capital gains in the housing market [is] likely to be
countered by increased supply of rental properties, rising vacancy rates and falling
rents in some areas. (SMP – August 2002, p 2)

However, over the second half of 2002, deterioration in the prospects for global
growth and a marked increase in the volatility of global share markets led to an
increased focus on near-term downside risks to the domestic economy. Growth in
output and inflation failed to reach the rates forecast when the 2002 tightenings
were conducted, and in spite of the risk posed by rapid growth in credit and house
prices, further moves towards a more neutral monetary policy setting were judged
not to be appropriate (SMP August and November 2002).
An impact of the policy tightenings and the accompanying statements on the
housing market was not obvious in the near-term. For example, loan approvals to
investors for housing continued to grow rapidly, increasing by more than
40 per cent in 2002. The Governor, in testimony to a parliamentary committee,
emphasised, however, that:
… the market works, but with long lags during which people are encouraged to take
decisions based on little more than optimistic extrapolation of what happened in the
past. Developers will continue to put up new apartment blocks while there are
investors willing to precommit to buy. These are the investors who turn up at
seminars where they are told by the developers how they can become very rich if
they highly gear themselves and buy an apartment. (Macfarlane 2002b)

Discussion by the Bank of the sustainability of the high rate of price increases
continued throughout 2002 (Stevens 2002, for example). The Bank also began to
highlight the role of speculation, the risks associated with rapid growth in leverage,
and emerging evidence of a reduction in lending standards (see below). Initially,
the focus was on the prospect of financial hardship for overburdened investors in
the event of a substantial correction in the housing market, but attention was also
directed to the potential effects of increased loan defaults on financial stability.

29
4.1.2 Developments in 2003
In early 2003, the Reserve Bank reiterated its concerns in the SMP about these
risks:
… the run-up in housing prices and associated expansion in housing-related debt
were a source of concern for most of the past year, given the potential of such a
process to remain disconnected from fundamentals and develop into a significant
imbalance over time. (SMP – February 2003, p 3)

At the same time, some comfort was taken from the tentative signs that pressures
in the housing market were easing, particularly in the investor segment. As it
turned out, these signs did not persist as the year progressed.
In a speech in April 2003, the Governor outlined the Bank’s concerns regarding
rising household indebtedness (Macfarlane 2003a). The worry was not so much
that a housing market downturn would directly impinge upon financial stability,
but rather that it could have adverse consequences for household consumption and
economic activity more generally.36 Also, the increasingly dominant role of
investors in the housing market reinforced earlier concerns that some households
did not adequately appreciate the risks and were simply extrapolating recent price
trends.
Through 2003, the Reserve Bank repeatedly drew attention to the risks associated
with ongoing rapid growth of house prices and housing credit. It also
acknowledged that there might be occasions when monetary policy might need to
be tightened in response to emerging financial imbalances. The contention was that
such a response could be justified within its flexible inflation-targeting framework,
which allowed longer-term considerations to be taken into account. If imbalances
in the housing market could pose a threat to medium-term economic stability, it
made sense to tolerate a higher policy rate than that which was justified by shorterterm inflation pressures. In a speech, the Deputy Governor explained this in terms
of a risk-management approach to policy decisions (Stevens 2003b): 37

36 Stevens (2003c) provides further discussion of this point.
37 Macfarlane (2002c) and Stevens (2003a) provide similar arguments in support of intervention.

30
… a case might be made, on rare occasions, to adopt a policy of ‘least regret’ so far
as asset prices are concerned, if financial and macroeconomic stability were thought
to be at risk.

It is worth noting that while the Reserve Bank of Australia did not raise rates until
late 2003, it stands out as having not cut rates through the year, whereas monetary
policy in every other developed economy, and in most of the large developing
economies, was eased at some point during 2003 in response to subdued
inflationary pressures (and fears of deflation in some cases) (IMF 2003).
Meanwhile, unease surrounding lending practices was being aired by APRA. In
late 2002, APRA wrote to the chief executives of authorised deposit-taking
institutions (ADIs), 38 calling for a conservative approach to risk and urging them
to avoid the temptation of relaxing lending standards in the wake of such a long
and sustained economic upswing; this correspondence was made public soon after
the fact (APRA 2002). While APRA acknowledged the generally healthy state of
Australian financial institutions, through 2003 it raised a number of concerns about
some emerging trends in the mortgage market, including the growth of brokeroriginated and ‘non-conforming’ lending, as well as the substantial increase in the
use of lenders’ mortgage insurance. 39 APRA noted that: ‘… the psychology of
home lending has changed from a credit rationing process to a product marketing
process’ (Littrell 2003). This had contributed to an increase in average LVRs for
mortgages, an over-reliance (by lenders) on collateral as a signal of a borrower’s
suitability, and a decline in the attention given to the ability to repay loans. So
while APRA’s stress test of institutions’ housing lending portfolios around that
time revealed that the financial system was well placed to weather a downturn in
the housing market, it raised some concerns, particularly for some institutions that
were not compiling important information regarding the extent and nature of their
exposures (Laker 2003). 40

38 ADIs (which we also describe loosely as ‘banking institutions’) include banks, building
societies and credit unions.
39 See, for example, APRA (2003), Esho (2003) and Littrell (2003).
40 One illustration of these points is provided by Laker (2007), which notes that some banking
institutions had – drawing on their own stress tests – perceived credit losses on their mortgage
portfolios to be in the order of 10 basis points, some 10 times lower than suggested by
APRA’s own stress tests of 2002/03.

31
The Reserve Bank also commented on the increased level of risk on the balance
sheets of financial institutions. At a parliamentary committee in December 2002,
the Governor highlighted deposit bonds as a key factor fuelling speculation and
increasing risks for more vulnerable investors:
… there are new financial instruments such as deposit bonds that have been created
that just make it so easy for people to do it [invest/speculate in property]. People
can actually make these investments on almost 100 per cent gearing.
(Macfarlane 2002b)

In addition, the Reserve Bank’s Annual Report for 2003 (released in September)
noted the increased risk posed by non-standard products such as home equity loans
and redraw facilities, which allowed borrowers to build up more debt and run it
down more slowly than had previously been the norm.
One factor that appeared to play some role in drawing attention to the risks in the
housing sector was the crackdown on property investment seminars, in particular,
the high-profile case of ‘spruiker’ (or promoter) Henry Kaye and his companies. In
March 2003, ASIC commenced legal proceedings, alleging dissemination of false
and misleading information by Mr Kaye and others. 41 When ASIC uncovered
evidence that the law had been breached it appointed administrators and receivers
to each of the companies involved. The effect of this on the confidence of investors
was reinforced by the commitment of the ACCC in September 2003 to crackdown
on deceptive conduct by property marketers, and by increased scrutiny of tax
deductions stemming from rental expenses by the ATO. Also, in September 2003,
regulations governing sales of residential property at auctions were tightened in
New South Wales and Victoria; in particular, the legislative changes were aimed to
reduce the number of dummy bids at auctions. 42
Towards the end of 2003, the Reserve Bank raised the cash rate, by 25 basis points
in November and again in December. The accompanying media release in
November cited the strength in the demand for credit as a reason not to delay a

41 Aside from legal breaches, there were allegations that marketers charged sizeable consultancy
fees for investment advice, such as to purchase properties in which advisors had undisclosed
financial interests (http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/21/1064082867568.html).
42 See, for example, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/psabar2003476/.

32
tightening that was called for on general macroeconomic grounds. At the same
time, the inflation forecasts were revised in light of further appreciation of the
exchange rate and stronger-than-expected growth in domestic demand, with
inflation expected to trough somewhat lower than 2 per cent in 2004 but with a
more pronounced pick-up, to 2½ per cent in the second half of 2005 (SMP
November 2003; Figure 9). It is worth noting that because of the predominance of
variable rate housing loans in Australia, increases in the cash rate were quickly
passed through to higher costs for existing and new borrowers. 43
In the months that followed, the Reserve Bank pointed to data suggesting that the
rate of increase in housing prices was slowing and the housing market had turned
down:
It remains to be seen to what extent the weakening in the inner-city property
markets in Sydney and Melbourne will spread more widely across the national
market. However, it is clear that sentiment about the property market has softened.
(SMP – February 2004, p 27)

Following this, there was discussion of the need for credit growth – which up to
mid 2004 had yet to show any real weakening – to slow to more sustainable levels.
Finally, a number of developments appeared to have reinforced the housing market
correction over 2004. In particular, the ACCC took further action against property
marketers and purveyors of ‘get-rich-quick’ schemes involving property where
there were concerns about fraud; and the NSW Government instituted a new tax on
investment housing aimed at reducing the influence of speculation (although this
was partly offset by a reduction in other taxes). 44

43 See Bloxham and Kent (2009) for a comparison of the US and Australian housing markets in
this regard.
44 The NSW Government levied a 2¼ per cent stamp duty on properties (excluding own homes)
where the sale price was more than 12 per cent higher than the purchase price; although, this
vendor duty could be claimed as a deduction against capital gains tax, thereby reducing its
effective rate. The duty came into effect on 1 July 2004 and was withdrawn on
2 August 2005.

Media Reports of RBA Statements

While it is difficult to quantify the effect of the Reserve Bank’s ‘open mouth
operations’ over this episode, we can at least confirm that the Bank’s statements
were widely reported at the time in the popular press. A survey of some of the
major papers from around Australia shows that coverage of the Bank’s comments
on housing market issues increased noticeably between 2002 and 2004. Based on a
keyword search of articles mentioning the Reserve Bank of Australia and interest
rates, the proportion that also mentioned housing increased from an average of
10 per cent in 2001 to 18 per cent in 2002 and 26 per cent in 2003, before trending
down in the following couple of years (Figure 10). The timing of these changes
aligns with the pattern of Bank statements over this period.

A similar exercise shows that the proportion of articles on the Reserve Bank and
interest rates which also discussed credit increased between 2002 and 2003,
although the series is much more volatile from one month to the next. This share
was sustained at a high level in 2004 (at around 10 per cent on average), at the

34
height of Bank statements regarding the need for a return to more sustainable
levels of credit growth.
Approaching the question from a slightly different perspective, it was found that
the percentage of articles mentioning housing that also contained a reference to the
Reserve Bank of Australia also trended up significantly over the period, peaking
sharply around the November 2003 cash rate increase, before trending down
through 2004 and 2005.

Conclusions

The role of policy in responding to asset prices remains a contentious issue.
However, support for the approach of responding only after damaging asset price
declines are underway has diminished in light of the fall-out from the global
financial crisis. An idea that appears to be gaining wider acceptance is that there is
a case for policy to focus on financial imbalances more generally, rather than asset
prices in particular.
If one accepts that policy should, on occasions, respond in some way to growing
financial imbalances then the issue is which policies should be used to respond and
how much should they ‘lean against’ these imbalances. In contrast to the earlier
debates about whether to burst asset-price bubbles, more attention is now being
focused on an intermediate path of leaning against emerging imbalances with a
view to reducing their severity and hence the cost of any subsequent financial and
macroeconomic disturbances. For monetary policy, this would require, at a
minimum, avoiding periods of unnecessarily low interest rates that might
exacerbate imbalances. Of course, such a strategy is likely to be more effective if
complemented by a tightening of macroprudential and other policies.
One difficulty in this whole debate is that there is little practical evidence about
how effective an intermediate leaning strategy might be. The Australian experience
of 2002 to 2004 is potentially relevant. A key feature of this episode was the
significant influence of investors, as well as the decline in lending standards during
the expansionary phase. This raised concerns within the Reserve Bank and APRA
regarding the risks associated with such trends.

35
The Bank highlighted the risks associated with sustained high rates of housing
price and credit growth when the cash rate was raised in 2002. This was not
inconsistent with the Bank’s inflation-targeting framework, which allows for a
degree of flexibility, including the ability to account for potential risks to longerterm prospects. From 2002 to 2003, the frequency with which the Bank highlighted
the risks arising from housing market developments increased. In late 2003, the
Bank raised rates again, highlighting concerns about the pace of housing price and
credit growth. This came around the same time as the release of the results of
APRA’s stress test of housing loan portfolios, the ATO announcement of an
increase in the number of audits of individuals claiming tax deductions on rental
properties, and the prosecution of a high-profile property marketer by ASIC. A
number of measures suggest that housing prices peaked around December 2003.
Most importantly, the turnaround in the market was associated with a sharp
reduction in the role of investors and clearly demonstrated that large parts of the
market can and do experience falling prices.
It is difficult to draw a definitive link between these housing market developments
on the one hand, and the policy actions and associated statements on the other. One
problem is that it is difficult to come up with a robust structural model of housing
prices. Another related problem is the time it takes for policies to gain traction in
the face of growing speculative pressures. Some might be tempted to argue that the
rise in the cash rate in late 2003 (of 50 basis points) was too small to turnaround
the housing market and suggest, therefore, that the market turned on its own
accord. However, the timing of the turnaround is consistent with the cumulative
impact of the full range of modest but consistent policy actions – by the Bank as
well as the regulatory authorities – affecting the dynamics in the housing market.
Furthermore, it is difficult to know what might have happened if the Reserve Bank
had remained silent, kept monetary policy looser than was the case, and the
regulatory authorities had not responded.
Looking beyond 2004, it has been suggested that the turnaround was temporary,
that house prices did not fall by much and have subsequently rebounded
(Posen 2009). However, this ignores some important and persistent effects of the
turnaround that started in late 2003. Perhaps most importantly, it provided a stark
and timely reminder that house prices can fall and that those with high rates of
leverage are more vulnerable to such corrections. Consistent with this, investors

36
have played a less prominent role in the market since that time. Also, the
subsequent rise in loan arrears for non-conforming and low documentation loans
clearly highlighted the greater risks associated with these products. Finally, the
ratio of housing prices to income has been reasonably flat for a number of years.

me if people started looking at other arms of policy—for example, tax policy.’
‘I think there is a regulatory gap there. It is clearly a problem if there is one group of people
who are holding seminars on how to invest your money who are regulated—the financial
planners—and there is another group who are doing almost exactly the same thing, although
doing it within the one asset class, which is property, who are unregulated. So I think there is
a need to extend the capacity for ASIC to do that.’

can have major economic implications …
So where does this leave us? I believe it should leave us trying to think about outcomes and
risks, and policy settings which seek to manage those risks, over a horizon a bit longer than is
common in much discussion of economic policy. Is this a departure from our long-established
medium-term, flexible approach to inflation targeting? Definitely not. In fact, it dovetails
quite well with the long-held view that policy should not respond solely to the inflation
forecast at some fixed horizon and ignore other considerations. All that is new is that there is
an additional dimension to the general rationale to maintain, and on occasion to use, the
flexibility the system has always had.’

‘As the fall in prices becomes widely known, it should allow potential house purchasers to
take their time … It should also enable them to resist the blandishments of the banks, brokers
and other commission agents plying them with offers of seemingly generous quantities of
credit. It should also reinforce the recent tendency of investors to question the assumption
about easy capital gains.’
‘When the public recognise that prices are going down rather than up—as they are
recognising because they are reading it more and more in the papers—I think it should affect
their behaviour.’

though this will need to adjust further if the growth of housing credit is to return to a
reasonably sustainable pace.’ p 3

decline in house prices does not appear to be large, though equally there does not appear
much risk of a renewed upsurge at present.’ p 3
