    "abstract": "\n\nThe discomfort a government suffers from speculation against its currency determines the strategic incentives of speculators and the scope for multiple currency-market equilibria.  After describing an illustrative model in which high unemployment may cause an exchange- rate crisis with self-fulfilling features, the paper reviews some other self-reinforcing mechanisms.  Recent econometric evidence seems to support the practical importance of these mechanisms.\n\n",
