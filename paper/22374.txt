The Permanent Effects of Fiscal Consolidations

June 2016, Revised August 2016
JEL No. E32,E62,O4
ABSTRACT
The global financial crisis has permanently lowered the path of GDP in all advanced economies.
At the same time, and in response to rising government debt levels, many of these countries have
been engaging in fiscal consolidations that have had a negative impact on growth rates. We
empirically explore the connections between these two facts by extending to longer horizons the
methodology of Blanchard and Leigh (2013) regarding fiscal policy multipliers. Our results
provide support for the presence of strong hysteresis effects of fiscal policy. The large size of the
effects points in the direction of self-defeating fiscal consolidations as suggested by DeLong and
Summers (2012). Attempts to reduce debt via fiscal consolidations have very likely resulted in a
higher debt to GDP ratio through their long-term negative impact on output.

1. Introduction.
After more than eight years since the global financial crisis started, most
advanced economies are still suffering from its aftermath and GDP remains far
from its pre-crisis trend. Relative to previous business cycles, the current cycle
can be characterized by a much more protracted and persistent recession without
a strong recovery that has allowed for a return to trend.
While this persistence is now recognized by policy makers, it was not obvious in
the early years of the crisis. When the crisis started, the original GDP forecasts
suggested a progressive return towards previous trends, as it would be expected
from a standard recovery phase. But that return never happened, and GDP
forecasts were continuously revised downwards as the crisis unfolded leading to
a succession of positively correlated forecast errors. As time passed, pessimism
grew about the potential level of GDP.1
While this phenomenon is true for most advanced economies, including the US,
the pattern has been the most dramatic for the European economies, where the
crisis has been felt the most.
In Figure 1 we show the evolution of US GDP as predicted by the IMF World
Economic Outlook (WEO) three different dates: April 2007 (before the crisis),
April 2008 (after the first wave of the crisis) and April 2010 after most of the
effects of the crisis were settled (at least for the US). We can see how the
downward revisions of GDP that took place in 2008 were followed by additional
revisions in 2010 as the crisis was much more persistent than expected.2
We can also see from the forecasts that in 2010 the deviations from previous
trends were expected to be persistent. And this pessimism was not unfounded as
the 2010 forecast for GDP in 2015 ended up being very much in line with the
actual data for that year. Today, there is very little hope of returning anywhere
close to the pre-crisis GDP trend.

See Ball (2014).
Each WEO provides forecasts for the next five years. We have extended these forecasts by
extrapolating average growth rates from 2000 until the last year in which a forecast is included.
For example, for the WEO 2010 we have forecasts up to 2015. We extend them to 2021 by using
the average growth rate between 2000 and 2015.

In the case of Europe, the same phenomenon looks even more dramatic. Not only
the revisions were large in the first years but they continued even after 2010 as
the Euro zone entered its second recession. And when forecasts were being
revised downwards, they also did so for long horizons. In Figure 2 we show the
change in both GDP as well as estimates of potential output for the Euro area in
three different dates: April 2007 (before the crisis), April 2011 (after the first wave
of the crisis) and April 2016, the latest available data.3
The April 2007 WEO does not contain forecast beyond 2008 for GDP or Potential. In that case,
we are we are extrapolating both series using the average growth rate since 1999. The April 2011

What is clear from the chart is that the current crisis is very persistent. Relative to
the trend that the Euro area was following since the Euro was launched in 1999,
GDP today is still far below that level (about 13% below). In addition, potential
has been revised downwards by a similar amount. The IMF expects today that by
2021 the Euro area will be about 15% below the level implied by its pre-crisis
trend.4 The revisions to potential output have gone hand in hand with the change
in output. By 2011 both output and potential had fallen relative to 2007
projections. By 2015 as output remains far below the 2011 projections, potential
output has also been revised downwards and by a similar magnitude.
In some ways the persistence of GDP during the crisis does not entirely come as
a surprise. The fact that recessions are persistent and can even leave permanent
effects on GDP trend is well known in the academic literature since the presence
of unit roots in GDP became accepted. There is also more specific evidence about
the length and persistence of crises with a strong financial component, as the one
we have just witnessed.
However, there is no consensus on the origin of this persistence and how it
should affect economic policy discussions. Some see it as a reflection of structural
issues and the need for reforms. Others see it as the permanent effects of cyclical
phenomena that might have been exacerbated by poor economic policy choices.
In this second case, the wrong economic policy can be partly to blame for the
permanent loss in output.
The debate is particularly relevant for the current crisis. Many advanced
economies have been dealing with the consequences of large fiscal deficits and
debt that required a process of fiscal consolidation. In order to decide on the
necessary amount of fiscal consolidation, policy makers needed to incorporate
their views on GDP and its future growth rate to assess debt sustainability. As
fiscal consolidation was implemented, we witnessed its negative effects on
output growth. If multipliers are large, this can lead to a negative loop in which
negative GDP growth leads policy makers to believe that further fiscal policy
adjustments are needed.
WEO contains forecasts up to 2016. We are extrapolating both series for the next five years using
the average growth rate since 1999. The April 2016 WEO contains forecasts up to 2021 for both
variables. GDP data prior to 2007 is not identical in all three vintages because of data revisions.
Potential was also revised backwards for several of these years.
4 These numbers underestimate the actual changes in potential because the IMF has revised
backwards its estimates for potential for earlier years. In our empirical analysis we will correct for
these effects and we explain our methodology in an appendix at the end of the paper.

4

In order to avoid this potential negative loop, policy makers look at measures of
sustainability that are based on long-run projections of GDP to avoid the
pessimistic bias introduced by using current low growth rates. For this reason, it
is common practice for debt ratios to be calculated as a % of potential GDP. But
as shown in Figure 2, potential GDP measures were also changing as a result of
the crisis in a way that was not too different from GDP. What if potential output
was also being affected by the crisis itself? And what if fiscal policy, through its
cyclical effects, was partly responsible for the reduction in potential GDP?
Ignoring these effects would make fiscal policy unnecessarily contractionary.
This is the focus of our paper. By extending the methodology of Blanchard and
Leigh (2013) to longer horizons as well as applying it to potential output we
analyze how fiscal consolidations during the 2009-2011 period led to changes in
our long-term views on GDP and how this potentially created negative
permanent effects on GDP.
We make use of IMF forecasts of both actual and potential GDP and analyze how
they changed in responses to fiscal consolidations plans implemented in the
early years of the crisis (2009-2011). The results suggest a strong correlation
between fiscal consolidations and revisions to long-term and potential GDP. We
show that fiscal policy had a negative impact on output that extends over a long
horizon, as the long-term performance of GDP and the estimates of potential
output were both negatively affected by fiscal consolidations.
The size of the effect is very large. In fact, our estimates provides evidence
supporting the argument of DeLong and Summers (2012) who bring up the
possibility of self-defeating fiscal consolidations, i.e. reductions in deficits that
end up delivering higher debt-to-GDP ratios because of their negative effects on
potential GDP. This has strong implications for the assessment of economic
policies during the crisis. The cost of austerity extends beyond a short-run impact
on GDP, it permanently affects the expected path of GDP and its effects on
sustainability are exactly the opposite than its original goals.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an analysis of the
persistence of GDP during the crisis. Section 3 compares this persistence to the
behavior of potential output. Section 4 discusses alternative theoretical
explanations for this behavior. Section 5 uses the fiscal consolidation of 2009-2011
as a way to identify the causes of persistence. Section 6 compares our estimates to
the parameters of DeLong and Summers (2012) and Section 7 concludes.

2. The persistence of the Global Financial Crisis.
2.1 Forecast errors and persistence.
Starting in early 2007 GDP growth in advanced economies slowed down. By the
end of 2007 the decrease in growth rates was evident and it materialized in a
recession that started in 2008 and deepened in 2009.5 The crisis came as a surprise
to forecasters, both private and official.
To understand how far forecasts were from the actual values of GDP we make
use in our analysis of the forecasts made by the World Economic Outlook
(WEO). The WEO is produced every 6 months, in April and October. The IMF
makes its forecasts available through an online database that includes forecasts
for at least two years. But there is also an unpublished complete set of 5-year
forecasts to which we had access and that we use in our empirical analysis.
We start with the April 2007 issue of the WEO that, to a large extent, precedes the
crisis. We take the 2006 data in that vintage of the database as factual and ignore
the fact that later issues of the WEO will revise the data. We make use of the
available forecasts going all the way to the year 2012.
We use the following notation for the forecast made in year 𝑡𝑡 of a variable 𝑌𝑌 for
the year 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑖𝑖.
�,�
𝑌𝑌���

So for GDP in 2009, the forecast made in 2007 will be expressed as
�,����
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����

We compare these forecasts with the actual data for GDP. The data comes from
the April 2016 edition of the WEO. We can for example calculate the forecast
error for the year 2009 as:
����
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹���,����

=

�,����
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺���� − 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����

𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����

The NBER declared December 2007 as the starting month for the US recession. The CEPR
concluded that the Euro had entered a recession in the first quarter of 2008.

Because of data revisions, changes in base year and also changes in national
accounting rules, the forecast and the actual data might not be comparable as
they might not be in the same units or follow the same national accounting
criteria.6 Because we are interested in revisions to growth rates, we will make the
two number comparable by rebasing the original WEO 2007 real GDP series and
its forecasts so that the 2006 data matches the data for that year of the WEO April
2016. Given that the 2006 data now coincides in both the April 2007 and the April
2016 databases, the expression above can be simply calculated as the forecast
error of accumulated GDP growth from 2006 to 2009.7
We first plot the data for 34 advanced economies (Figure 3).8 The forecast of real
GDP for the year 2009 was clearly too optimistic compared to the actual data.
And for some countries such as Estonia, Latvia or Ireland the forecast error is as
large as 30%.

We can think of these figures as the cyclical shock that hit advanced economies in
the years 2007-2009, where by cyclical shock we have in mind the unexpected
change in GDP during those two years.
Since October 2014 the WEO has started using updated data using ESA2010 criteria.
An appendix at the end of the paper describes in detail the calculation of the forecast error.
8 An appendix at the end of the paper includes the list of all countries used in our analysis.

The next question is how persistent this shock was. As we move our horizon
forward and as time passes, did these cyclical events became temporary
deviations from trend or did we continue seeing a large forecast error? If these
deviations were indeed transitory, we would expect the forecast error to decrease
over time as output returns to trend.
We continue using the April 2007 WEO and look at the forecast made for 2012.
We also extend the forecast horizon to 2015 by extrapolating GDP growth rates
in the 2000-2012 period.9
When we compare the three forecast errors for all advanced economies we see a
very large amount of persistence. Figure 4 shows the data for a representative
sample of countries. The deviations of real GDP from forecasts in 2012 is almost
always larger than those in 2009. The 2015 forecast error is also typically larger
than the 2012 one, in particular in the European countries. This suggests that we
see very little (or none) trend reversion and that the first shock continued its
propagation during the 2009-2015 years and, in that sense, it became permanent.
We therefore confirm in this figure the results of Ball (2014): there is strong
evidence that the 2008 crisis left permanent effects on GDP judged by the state of
these economies by the year 2015.
The fact that shocks to GDP are persistent is known since the first discussions on
the existence of a unit root in GDP and are not just relevant to the last crisis. For
example, Campbell and Mankiw (1989) were the first ones to look at GDP
persistence in an international sample. Using simple univariate regressions, they
analyzed by how much an unexpected 1% change in GDP changes future values
of GDP. Their conclusion was that the initial change in GDP gets propagated
over very long horizons. By comparing forecast errors at different horizons we
are performing a similar exercise but for a single event over an eight-year
window.

When we extend the IMF forecasts beyond their 5 year horizons we always include the data
since 2000 as well as the 5 years of forecast ahead to produce and average growth rate that is then
applied to the years beyond those five. This could be considered as a pessimistic scenario as we
are including the crisis years to calculate a future trend. We have reproduced all our results using
only the available years (without using the forecasts) as well as just the years before the crisis
(2008). Qualitatively the results are identical but forecast errors become larger if trends are
calculated excluding the crisis years.

What we can also see in Figure 4 is not just that GDP was lower in 2012 or 2015
than what we expected, it is that, across countries, the deviation of GDP from its
forecast in those years is very much correlated with the size of the first shock.
The countries where the initial shock was large are the same countries where the
forecast error several years ahead is the largest. This is an important fact because
it suggests that there is a positive correlation in forecast errors across countries so
the changes in GDP over long horizons are related to the size of the initial shock.
This would not be the case if we were looking at random independent shocks
taking place in different years.

9

To make this correlation in cross-country persistence explicit we run a regression
of the forecast error for these later years against the forecast error for 2009. For
this analysis we also include an additional horizon by calculating the forecast
error for 2021.10
In Table 1 we show the results for all advanced economies. The coefficient is
greater than one, signaling that the outlook for 2012, 2015 and 2021 has changed
even more than the unexpected change in GDP in 2009. In other words, what the
regression shows is that these forecast errors over longer horizons are correlated
with the initial change in GDP. Countries that suffer larger crisis have seen a
much larger downward revision of our GDP estimates for the future, the crisis is
seen as long lived.

Interestingly, a similar pattern is visible among a group of emerging markets
(Table 2). Using the same methodology as above we replicate the analysis for a
sample of 31 emerging markets and we get similar result with an even larger
coefficient.11
We use 2021 because it is the latest year for which the April 2016 WEO produces a forecast.
Although we refer to this figure as a forecast error, what we are really capturing is the change in
forecast for the year 2021 between our extended forecast using the IMF data of the April 2007
WEO and the one produced by the IMF for the WEO in April 2016.
11 The fact that persistence is larger for emerging markets with higher growth rates is consistent
with the findings of Fatás (2000).

Why is output so persistent? Is the labor market relevant to explain the
persistence of GDP shocks? We replicate in Table 3 the specification of Table 1
but with the addition of the forecast error of both the unemployment rate and
employment over the same years to understand if changes in the labor market
can help explain the persistence of GDP forecast errors in 2015 and 2021.

While these results have to be taken with great care given the unstructured
nature of our specification, labor market variables do not seem to have much
explanatory power beyond the changes in GDP. With the exception of
employment at the 2015 horizon, none of the other variables are significant. This
does not mean that the labor market does not matter, as it is behind the initial
change in GDP, but it shows that differences in labor market performance among
two countries with similar GDP changes in the earlier years does not
significantly improve our understanding the long-term persistence of GDP. And
the fact that the significance is only present at a shorter horizon is consistent with
the logic that labor market outcomes might be persistent over several years but
they tend to return to normal over a longer horizon. The very long-term
persistence of GDP needs to be explained by other factors such as physical
capital or productivity.

2.2. Persistence or permanent effects?
So far we have seen that an unexpected change in GDP was very persistent and
that the 2015 or 2021 forecasts were revised by an amount that is as large or
larger than the initial impulse. Will these persistent effects ever die out? Or will
these persistent effects become permanent?
One way to address this question is to make use of measures of potential output.
Potential output can be seen as a long-term forecast for GDP given the available
information today. The distance between potential output and GDP (the output
gap) is an indication of the possibility that GDP will return to previous trend in
the future. If cyclical events are seen as transitory, a fall in GDP should lead to no
change in potential output. But if the changes in GDP as seen as having not just a
persistent effect but a permanent effect on output, then potential output will be
revised downwards. In that sense, the estimates of potential output offer us an

12

opportunity to look into the persistent effects of this crisis even beyond the year
2021.
We now replicate our previous regressions but using as dependent variable the
forecast error of potential GDP for the same three years (2012, 2015 and 2021).12
We once again use the unexpected change in GDP during 2006-09 as our measure
of the initial shock and we ask how potential output changed relative to what we
had earlier anticipated (Table 4).

The estimates suggest that the revisions to potential output were very large as
well. In fact the size of the coefficients in Table 4 are very similar to what we
found in Table 2 , suggesting that the large revisions to GDP are becoming
permanent, as captured by the change in potential output. As an example, the
unexpected decrease in GDP until 2009 can help explain a decrease in about 1.8
percentage points of potential output in 2021, slightly smaller than the 2.1
percentage points we found for GDP. Another way to reach the same conclusion
is to look at current estimates of output gap. While they signal some expected
Calculating forecast errors for potential output is more complicated than for GDP. Potential
output is not observed but estimated. In addition, revisions to current level of potential output
tend to lead to revisions of past levels of potential output. In our calculations we ignore these
historical revisions. What we are comparing is how our view of future potential output changes
as time passes. This means that we cannot simply compare forecast errors in growth rates as we
did with GDP. We explain in detail the methodology we use to deal with ex-post revisions to
potential output estimates in an appendix at the end of the paper.

recovery in the years ahead, this recovery is much smaller than the output that
has been lost so far, the losses have become permanent.
While these effects seem to be present across all 29 advanced economies, they are
stronger in some countries. Table 5 repeats the same exercise for the sample of
European countries and Euro members. Overall the coefficients are the largest
among the Euro members.

3. Is the persistence of GDP surprising? Literature review.
3.1. Output shocks tend to be persistent.
So far we have shown that the shock that hit advanced economies after 2007 has
been very persistent. More than eight years after the crisis started the current
level of output as well as the estimates of potential GDP are much lower than
expected. It is by now well accepted that these countries will not regain their pretrend crisis levels.
In many ways this should not be a big surprise, since we know from the
pioneering work of Nelson and Plosser (1982) that fluctuations are persistent and
that US GDP displays a unit root in GDP. And Campbell and Mankiw (1989),
among others, later confirmed that this persistence is also present for G7

14

countries: a 1% fall in output lowers its long-term projection by more than 1%,
consistent with our findings.
The large persistence is also supported by an empirical literature that has studied
the long-term permanent effects of large crises. The focus of this literature is
typically only on negative shocks (“crises”) that are large and clearly identifiable
in the data.
Many of the papers have studied either emerging markets (where crises tend to
be larger) or financial crises that tend to be characterized by deep and protracted
recessions. The evidence shows that output fails to catch up with its previous
trend after any of these large events.
Cerra and Saxena (2008) produce evidence that after financial and political crises
output losses are very persistent even after taking into account the possibility of
endogeneity. Using a much longer time horizon Reinhart and Rogoff (2014) also
show that recovery from financial crisis is slower than from regular crisis (similar
results in International Monetary Fund (2009), Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor
(2011) or Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2011)).13
Some of these papers assess directly the effect that financial crises have on
potential output. Furceri and Mourougane (2012) show that financial crisis have
a significant effect on potential output for OECD economies. Ball (2014) focuses
on the Great Recession to show that potential output has been reduced
significantly among OECD countries.
The strong persistence of recessions applies to more than just large financial
crisis. Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015), Martin and Wilson (2013) and
Haltmaier (2013) show that across all recessions in advanced economies over the
last 40 years GDP is very persistent. More interestingly, they also show that
potential output is consistently revised downwards during crisis years. This is
very much consistent with the evidence we have presented in the previous
section.

Although others have expressed partial disagreement with this assessment. Howard, Martin,
and Wilson (2011) show that recoveries are in fact very quick after deep financial crisis although
they agree that they are very slow after long financial crisis. And Bordo and Haubrich (2012) or
Romer and Romer (2014) present an even more dissenting view about why financial crisis are
special using data for US or advanced economies.

A related, although separate literature, emphasizes the persistent or permanent
effects of recessions on the labor market. The literature started with the
observation that European unemployment failed to return to its pre-crisis level
during the 70s (Blanchard and Summers (1986)). The literature has recently
regained some interest because of the persistent behavior of unemployment and,
in particular, long-term unemployment, during the Great Recession mainly in
Europe but also in the US.

3.2. Interpreting the persistence of shocks (and large crises).
The early evidence on the persistence of GDP shocks, both positive and negative,
provided support to theories where technology shocks were the driving force of
business cycles (RBC). Traditionally, the trend was seen as driven by a standard
growth model (e.g. Solow) and models of the business cycles, even those based
on Keynesian views of fluctuations, assumed that booms and recessions
represented deviations from this trend.
The fact that Nelson and Plosser (1982) showed that the trend itself was
stochastic and its variance could account for a large amount of the GDP variation
was seen as evidence that technology shocks were a significant driving force of
fluctuations. In fact, the persistence of shocks was used as a way to separate
demand (temporary) from supply (permanent) sources of shocks as in Blanchard
and Quah (1989).
But there is also a very different interpretation of the persistence of GDP, if we
are willing to deviate from the tradition of separating long-term dynamics and
business cycles. It is possible that cyclical conditions leave permanent scars on
output, what is typically referred to as hysteresis. It was originally applied to
models of the labor market as in Blanchard and Summers (1986) where cyclical
unemployment turned into structural one. But the logic extends even more
naturally when we start thinking of long-term growth as endogenous and we
allow for the possibility that economic cycles interrupt temporarily these longterm dynamics. Stadler (1990) showed how in endogenous growth models any
type of shock has permanent effects on GDP because it temporarily affects the
underlying growth dynamics. During recessions, investment is lower, R&D
expenditures are lower and trend growth happens at a lower pace that during
normal years. Fatás (2000) presents a similar model as well as evidence
supporting this logic.

16

The difficulty of separating these two hypothesis (technology shocks versus
hysteresis) is dealing with endogeneity. The literature has followed several
approaches to providing evidence supporting hysteresis. First, variables that
drive trend growth are indeed affected by cyclical conditions (e.g. investment
and R&D expenditures are procyclical). Second, there is a correlation between
the growth process and the persistence of fluctuations (Fatás (2000) shows that
persistence is correlated to average growth rates). Finally, we can also avoid
endogeneity if we are able to identify specific shocks that are cyclical in nature
(such as monetary or fiscal policy shocks) and then analyze the persistence of
GDP in response to these shocks. Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015) show
that recessions that are caused by demand shocks tend to be very persistent.
International Monetary Fund (2009) presents evidence that during the Asian
crisis, countries with stronger countercyclical policies had less persistent
fluctuations. We follow this last strand of the literature by studying the cyclical
movements in output that resulted from the widespread 2009-11 fiscal
consolidations to understand how much they can explain the observed
persistence in GDP.

4. Cyclical or structural? A test using the 2009-11 fiscal consolidation.
4.1. Identifying fiscal policy shocks.
We have documented in Section 2 that the crisis that started in 2007 has turned to
be very persistent across all countries. From our discussion in Section 3 we
understand that there are two potential explanations. First, it could be that the
depth of the crisis is simply driven by changes in potential output. For this to be
true, it would have to be that during the years 2008-15 these countries have
suffered structural changes that have made forecasters revise downwards the
estimates of potential output. These changes must have had a country-specific
component that explains the cross-country variation. And the changes must have
been unanticipated; i.e. aging and demographic changes could be relevant to
understand dynamics of potential output but they were anticipated before the
crisis.
The second explanation for persistence is that country-specific factors (such as
economic policies or labor market characteristics or pre-crisis dynamics) have
generated variation in the depth and length of the crisis that has translated into a
fall in potential output via hysteresis effects.

17

Separating these two effects from an empirical point of view is challenging.
Ideally one needs to identify exogenous movements in macroeconomic variables
that can be used to identify one the direction in which causality runs. This issue
is no different from the endogeneity problems of the literature on fiscal policy
multipliers and the debate about the effects of austerity: we know that fiscal
policy austerity seems to be correlated with decreases in output but in which
direction does causality run?
In the context of the fiscal policy multiplier debate Blanchard and Leigh (2013)
introduced a simple methodology to deal with endogeneity in order to measure
the impact of the 2009-2010 fiscal consolidations in European economies. Their
methodology is in many ways similar to the identification assumptions of more
complex econometric specification (such as a VAR) but in a much simpler
framework. Their methodology relies on the fact that GDP forecast errors should
be uncorrelated with fiscal policy if the model used to generate the forecasts has
the right assumptions about fiscal policy multipliers. If we find that the
correlation is negative and significant it means that the model is underestimating
fiscal policy multipliers.
We make use of their methodology to explore how fiscal policy can be
responsible for the changes in both GDP over a longer horizon and potential
output during the years that followed the fiscal consolidation. In other words, we
make use of their methodology to identify a shock to fiscal policy and then assess
the long-term response of GDP as well as the effects of potential output to this
shock.
We start by replicating the results of Blanchard and Leigh (2013). We use the
same years, 2010 and 2011 where fiscal consolidations were planned and
executed among many economies. We also focus on the same set of countries:
European countries among the advanced economies. We collect data from the
April 2010 WEO and measure the planned fiscal consolidation over the next two
years (2010 and 2011) as the change in the forecast of the change in the structural
� ����
). This is identical to the
balance as a percentage of potential GDP (∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆�,���������
specification in Blanchard and Leigh (2013) and this magnitude can be thought of
as the size of the planned fiscal consolidation. We then measure the forecast error
for real GDP in the level of output for different years (𝑡𝑡).
The forecast error is computed using the data available (𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺�,� ) from the IMF
World Economic Outlook of April 2016 against the forecast made in April 2010.

Under the assumption that the forecast had been made using the right fiscal

(2013) found that the coefficient was negative, large and significant, a sign that
fiscal policy multipliers had been underestimated by the IMF model.

When we replicate their results for 2011 (Table 6), we find almost identical result
(there are small differences because of slightly different sample and because the
data has been revised since their analysis). We find a coefficient of about 1.3 for
Europe as a whole, similar to their results, and slightly larger if we restrict the
sample to Euro countries. Remember that the forecast made by the IMF in April
2010 for the next two years already assumed that fiscal consolidation would
affect GDP with a multiplier of 0.5. In that sense, the coefficient 𝛽𝛽 here represents
the effects of fiscal consolidation in addition to that assumed multiplier (0.5).
Given the coefficient of 1.3 the estimated multiplier is around 1.8 for Europe and
closer to 2 for the Euro members.

19

4.2. The persistent effects of fiscal policy shocks.
Using the methodology of Blanchard and Leigh (2013) we have identified
movements in GDP that are associated to the fiscal consolidations that took place
during the years 2009-2011. We now want to assess how persistent these changes
in GDP were and whether they were also reflected in changes in potential
output.
In order to capture these effects, we run a two-stage procedure: we first regress
changes in output during the earlier years of the crisis (2010-11) on the planned
fiscal consolidation during those years (this is identical to the Blanchard and
Leigh (2013) specification of Table 6):

as the explanatory
variable to understand unexpected changes in GDP over longer horizons.
����
����
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹���,�
= 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹���,����
+ 𝜀𝜀�

The interpretation of this second regression is that we are measuring the effects
on long-term GDP of changes that took place during 2010-11 that were caused by
the fiscal consolidation during those two years. In other words, we are isolating
changes in GDP that are caused by identifiable changes in demand (via fiscal
policy) and assessing whether they become persistent over time.
The estimates of Table 7 show that the fiscal-policy-induced changes in GDP in
the years 2009-2011 were very persistent. A 1% change in GDP led to changes in
more than 1% by 2015 and around 2% by the year 2021. These results are
consistent with our early analysis of persistence but now we are identifying
movements in output that we have identified as driven by fiscal policy, so we
can see the long-term damage of fiscal consolidations.14

Our 2SLS can be interpreted as an IV estimation of the long-term effects of cyclical changes in
GDP using fiscal policy as an instrument. A Durbin-Wu-Hausman test shows that the hypothesis
of exogeneity in the OLS estimates cannot be rejected. This means that the persistent effects

The fact that the coefficient is similar across the two samples does not mean that
the overall effects are the same. We are not measuring a fiscal policy multiplier in
this table, we are capturing the extent to which short-term changes in GDP
became persistent. In Table 6 we have shown that the short-term multiplier was
larger for the Euro members. Given that now we can see that the persistence is
similar for both samples, it means that the initial larger multiplier is also
translated into larger permanent effects for the Euro countries.
We can now test whether a similar pattern is observed when looking at potential
output. We estimate these effects using the same 2SLS procedure. The first-stage
regression is the same as before and for the second-stage regression we know use
forecast errors of potential GDP on the left-hand side of our regression:

����
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹����,�

The results of Table 8 confirm that the effects of fiscal policy are seen as
permanent, having an effect on our current estimates of potential output that are
as large or larger than the cyclical effect on GDP. The estimated coefficient is

identified by our 2SLS estimation are not different from the effects of any other cyclical
movements in GDP (those unrelated to fiscal policy). This is not a surprise, and it simply
confirms that the persistence of cyclical movements in GDP is not particular to dynamics created
by fiscal policy shocks.

do not die out over time but that the long-term effects are likely to be larger than
the initial ones. Every 1% fiscal-policy-induced decline in GDP during the years
2010-11 translated into a 1% decline in potential output by 2015 and even more
for 2021.

The results are significant for both samples with similar coefficients for the
Europe and Euro samples. And looking at the R-squared, the short-term fiscalpolicy-induced movements in GDP can explain a large percentage of the
variation in potential output across countries, as much as 65%.

4.3 Interpreting our results. Are there alternative explanations?
We have exploited the strong cross-country correlation between the fiscal
consolidations in 2010-11 period and the subsequent changes to GDP and
potential output to claim that fiscal policy has had large and permanent effects
on GDP. The effects might seem very large but we need to keep in mind that our
estimates take place during the worst recession since the Great Depression at a
time when monetary policy was constrained by the zero-lower bound in many
countries. In addition, for the countries inside the Euro area monetary and
exchange rate policies were unavailable at the country level.

22

As Blanchard and Leigh (2013) show, applying the same methodology to other
periods of time where these conditions do not apply produce much smaller
effects of fiscal policy on output. We would expect our results to be also weaker
for those periods.
When it comes to interpreting the size of our coefficients one needs to be careful.
While our specification is based on the analysis of fiscal policy multipliers of
Blanchard and Leigh (2013), we are looking at a longer horizon which makes the
interpretation of our estimates as multipliers less. In their analysis by matching
the timing of the fiscal consolidation to the change in the forecast error for GDP
one could argue that the variation in changes in GDP is directly related to fiscal
policy changes (which constitutes the standard definition of multipliers).15
In our case we extend the horizon by an additional four to eight years beyond the
years where the fiscal policy changes are taking place. In that sense, it is possible
that we are capturing some additional effects. In particular, the initial fiscal
policy shock could be correlated (across countries) with similar shocks in the
years ahead that also have an effect on GDP or potential. While this makes more
difficult the interpretation of our estimates as multipliers, we see this possibility
as strengthening the story we want to tell from our analysis.16
Countries that implemented large fiscal consolidations in 2010-11 might have
found themselves in 2012 with a depressed economy that might have required
even larger adjustments in fiscal policy that further depressed future growth. If
this is true, as we move the timing of GDP to 2015 and 2021 we are likely to
capture in our estimates also the effects of potential second-round fiscal
consolidations. But in many ways these can be seen as the outcomes of the first
policy decisions. In that sense, the fact that the final effects on GDP are correlated
with the initial fiscal policy shock suggests that our estimates are capturing the
full consequences of those policy decisions.

Of course, there could be longer-term effects on GDP that are not captured in their analysis but
as long as we believe that the majority of the effects of fiscal policy shocks are felt
contemporaneously, the estimate of multipliers will be close enough.
16 The fact that in many of our results the short-term effects are amplified as time passes suggests
that either there are other shocks that follow and are correlated with the initial one or the
presence of “superhysteresis”. It might be that not only the level of GDP is affected by the crisis
but also its growth rate, in a persistent manner. Studying these interesting issues is beyond the
scope of this paper and probably requires additional data to test each of these hypotheses.
15

23

We make use of estimates of potential GDP because they provide us with a better
sense on the long-term dynamics of output and a view on the permanent effects
on GDP. And as shown in Table 8, our estimates using potential output confirm
our results using GDP. The fiscal policy contraction of 2009-11 had an impact on
our views on potential output today (2015) which confirms the change in GDP
forecast we have constructed for 2021.
The use of potential output could raise some concerns because it is a constructed
variable that might be following GDP too closely and not capturing an accurate
and independent long-term forecast of GDP. This is possible but it is very
unlikely for two reasons. First, our results with potential output match the
results using GDP over a long-enough horizon, one that should be avoiding
contamination from cyclical dynamics. The fact that the value of GDP in 2015 or
its current forecast for 2021 are affected by the fiscal changes in 2010-11 are
already a good indication that these effects are extending over a very long
horizon. Second, if potential output was being wrongly estimated by simply
extrapolating the cyclical dynamics of GDP it would mean that over the next
years we would be expecting a very strong recovery in countries most affected
by the crisis. For example, we would be expecting Greece to deliver extremely
fast growth rates over the coming years not only to recover the 25% lost GDP but
in addition to catch up with the previous pre-crisis trend. This sounds very
implausible. There are no current forecasts of GDP from any national
government or international organization that suggests this will be the case.
While one can never rule out the possibility of a surprising performance from
European countries in the years ahead, all information currently available points
in the direction that the GDP losses they have suffered are indeed permanent.
Ideally we would like to wait 10 more years and run similar regressions using
GDP in 2025. In the absence of actual data for GDP for 2025, our analysis
provides the best estimates one can do of the long-term effects of the economic
policy choices countries made during the global financial crisis.

5. Was the fiscal consolidation self-defeating?
Our estimates suggest that the fiscal contraction in European economies reduced
output not only in the short term but also in the medium term and possibly on a
permanent basis. This reduction in output makes the goal of the fiscal
consolidation harder as it raises the ratio of debt to GDP and it reduces tax
revenues.

24

This is a point made by DeLong and Summers (2012) who argue that in a
depressed economy a fiscal consolidation can be self-defeating, it can lead to an
increase in debt. To understand the logic, and following closely their analysis, let
𝐷𝐷� be the level of government debt, 𝐺𝐺� spending, 𝑇𝑇� taxes and 𝑌𝑌� the level of GDP
in year 𝑡𝑡. Imagine a government that introduces a fiscal consolidation plan that
involves a decrease in spending.
Δ𝐺𝐺� = 𝐺𝐺��� − 𝐺𝐺�

where 𝐺𝐺��� refers to the level of government spending planned for next year
which we assume matches its execution. But the change in spending is likely to
affect negatively GDP next year. The change in GDP will depend on the fiscal
policy multiplier (𝜇𝜇).
Δ𝑌𝑌� = 𝜇𝜇 Δ𝐺𝐺�

The level of debt will be reduced by

Δ𝐷𝐷� = Δ𝐺𝐺� − Δ𝑇𝑇� = Δ𝐺𝐺� − 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇Δ𝐺𝐺� = (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇) Δ𝐺𝐺�

This reduction in the level of debt imposes a burden on future government
balances equal to
r − g Δ𝐷𝐷� = r − g (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇) Δ𝐺𝐺�

Where 𝑟𝑟 is the government borrowing rate and 𝑔𝑔 is the long-run growth rate of
GDP.
Assume some permanent effects of the recession caused by the fiscal
consolidation. In particular potential output is likely to change by an amount
�
(Δ𝑌𝑌� ) that is related to the cyclical change in output (Δ𝑌𝑌�� ).
�

Δ𝑌𝑌� = 𝜂𝜂 Δ𝑌𝑌�� = 𝜂𝜂 𝜇𝜇 Δ𝐺𝐺�

Where the parameter 𝜂𝜂 is the hysteresis parameter. Because of this change in
output there will be a permanent loss of revenues equal to
�

𝜏𝜏 Δ𝑌𝑌� = 𝜏𝜏 𝜂𝜂 𝜇𝜇 Δ𝐺𝐺�

A fiscal contraction is self-defeating as long as

25

𝜏𝜏 𝜂𝜂 𝜇𝜇 > r − g (1 − 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇)

DeLong and Summers (2012) calibrate the above parameters for the US economy.
Assuming plausible values for 𝑔𝑔 and 𝑟𝑟, they look for combination of parameter
values for the short-run fiscal multiplier and the hysteresis parameter that make
the above equation hold. The range of values they consider for the fiscal
multiplier is between 0-2.5. Our analysis above, following Blanchard and Leigh
(2013) produces a multiplier of about 1.8. Given this number and using DeLong
and Summers (2012) calibration, the hysteresis parameter would have to be
between 0 and 0.025 (this is assuming a real treasury rate between 2.5 and 5%).
How does this correspond to our estimates of the permanent effects of fiscal
consolidations? If we take our results at face value, the hysteresis effect is much
larger than any of these values. For example, if look at the regression of Table 8
we see permanent effects that are similar or than those during the years 2009-11.
If we identify those years as the cyclical changes in output then we would be
calibrating the parameter 𝜂𝜂 to be at or above 1, much higher than the required
level. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the fiscal consolidation that
took place during those years was self defeating and instead of delivering the
outcome of reducing debt, it led to an increase.
The idea that a government trying to restore debt sustainability should opt for
spending more can be seen as implausible, or as some might call a “free lunch”
(Rogoff (2015)). Our results do not suggest in any way that this is a standard
policy advise for all governments at all times. We are looking at a particular
episode where several special circumstances are coming together. First, for many
of these countries monetary policy was constrained either by the zero-lower
bound or because of the institutional arrangements of the Euro area. This is likely
to generate larger short-term fiscal policy multipliers (Eggertsson (2011) and
Eggertsson and Krugman (2012)). Second, this was a very deep crisis with
growth rates reaching negative numbers that had not been seen since the Great
Depression. In addition, the nature of the crisis made the recession long and the
recovery slow. This persistent short-run dynamics are likely to leave a much
larger permanent effects on output through hysteresis effects (see Blanchard,
Cerutti, and Summers (2015)). In the case of the Great Recession, this hysteresis
effects are the outcome not only of very persistent labor market dynamics but of
a depressed behavior of investment that results in a much lower capital stock
(see evidence in International Monetary Fund (2015)).

26

Hysteresis is crucial for the possibility of self-defeating fiscal consolidations. A
lower permanent level of output increases the debt-to-GDP ratio and it also
reduces the level of tax revenues. Because output is likely to trend upwards, so
are fiscal variables. While the recipe for a government with high debt is likely to
be a lower spending to GDP ratio, reducing spending and, as a result, GDP by a
similar amount not only does not achieve its objective but it leads to a higher
debt-to-GDP ratio. And the fact that some or all of the change in output is
permanent, makes austerity the wrong fiscal policy.
Our conclusion that to achieve any target effect on aggregate demand
countercyclical fiscal policy would have to be more aggressive given the nature
and persistence of the crisis also applies to monetary policy. As suggested in
Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015), the fact that cyclical shocks are likely to
have permanent effects on output calls for a much stronger stabilization policy
when policy makers seek to offset negative shocks to aggregate demand.
A final caveat regarding our reading of the empirical results. We are talking
about the potential benefits of having had a more expansionary fiscal policy. It is
possible that for some countries there was no alternative because financial
markets had completely cut access to additional. For capital markets to deny
funding a less contractionary fiscal policy it must be that our logic was not
shared or properly understood by capital markets at that point. Because if our
results are correct and both governments and markets agreed with our logic,
capital should continue to flow to support a fiscal policy that might be
expansionary but it promotes a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio. In addition,
even if markets do not accept the logic of our conclusions, it would be up to
international organizations (IMF or other governments not constrained in their
funding) to decide on additional funding to support the right type of fiscal policy
in the constrained economies, one that truly produces a more sustainable
budgetary position.

6. Conclusions
The global financial crisis has permanently lowered the path of GDP in all
advanced economies. In none of these countries GDP is expected to return to its
pre-crisis trend. At the same time, many of these countries have been engaging in
fiscal consolidations in response to rising government debt levels that had a
negative impact on growth rates. In this paper we use the methodology of
Blanchard and Leigh (2013) to show that fiscal consolidations had long-term

27

effects on GDP, at a horizon much longer than the traditional analysis of fiscal
policy multipliers. Our results strongly suggest that the negative effects on GDP
are indeed permanent.
We have first documented the persistence of the effects of the global financial
crisis. They are visible both in the current level of GDP and in the IMF forecasts
for 2021. In addition, we show that potential output has been revised
downwards by a similar amount, a sign that the reduction in GDP is mostly seen
as permanent, i.e. there is strong evidence of hysteresis.
While permanent changes in GDP could be associated to structural changes in
economic conditions (e.g. productivity shocks or changes in demographics), we
exploit the cross-country variation in persistence to show that a significant part
of the changes in actual and potential GDP are the direct result of the fiscal
consolidation implemented during the period 2009-2011.
The combination of strong cyclical effects of fiscal policy and hysteresis provides
support to the hypothesis of self-defeating fiscal consolidations of DeLong and
Summers (2012). If the negative effects of fiscal consolidation are long lasting,
countries can enter a negative loop where attempts to reduce government debt
are not effective because of the reductions in GDP. As GDP falls permanently,
attempts to reduce debt via reductions in spending or increases in taxes lead to a
higher debt to GDP ratio. Using our empirical results we produce a quick
calibration of the model of DeLong and Summers (2012) and show that the
calibrated parameter values support the notion of self-defeating fiscal
consolidations for the group of advanced economies, more so for the Euro
countries.

Appendix A. Calculating forecast errors for potential and actual
GDP.
When it comes to GDP forecast errors our methodology is straightforward. Let
the forecast made in year 𝑡𝑡 of a variable 𝑌𝑌 for the year 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑖𝑖.
�,�
𝑌𝑌���

So for GDP in 2009, the forecast made in 2007 will be expressed as
�,����
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����

We can compare these forecasts with the actual data for GDP at a later date to
compute the forecast error. In some cases when we are talking about a future
date from the perspective of both years we are calculating the change in forecast
between the two years.
As an example, we an calculate the forecast error for the year 2009 made in 2007
by comparing to the actual data from the 2016 vintage of the WEO as:
����
=
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹���,����

�,����
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺���� − 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����
�,����
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����

The only issue we face when comparing these two GDP levels is that because of
data revisions, changes in base year and also changes in national accounting
rules, the forecast and the actual data might not be comparable as they might not
be in the same units or follow the same national accounting criteria.

Because we are interested in revisions to growth rates, we make the two number
comparable by rebasing the original WEO 2007 real GDP series and its forecasts
so that the 2006 data matches the data for that year of the WEO April 2016. In
other words, given that the 2006 data now coincides in both the April 2007 and
the April 2016 databases, the expression above can simply be calculated as the
forecast error of accumulated GDP growth from 2006 to 2009:
����
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹���,����

�,����
����
����
����
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����
− 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����
− 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����

𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����

Where

𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����

refers to the data of GDP for year 𝑡𝑡 as reported in the vintage for year 𝑡𝑡 + 1.

When it comes to potential output we face a more challenging task. In April 2007
when the IMF produces a number for potential output for 2006, this is not
observed, it is an estimation of what they believed at that point potential was.
Future values of potential output are also dependent on their views at that point
in time.
Later when the crisis is in full force the IMF revises its views of potential output
but it also changes its views on the level of potential output in the past. These
revisions are very large and they completely change the perception of potential
output levels in previous years. This means that a calculation of forecast errors of
the level of potential GDP based on the accumulation of forecast errors of
potential growth rates, as calculated above, would be misleading. Because the
IMF has dramatically changed their views on potential output for both the
current and future years by rewriting history, it would seem as if the previous
path of potential output (measured in growth rates) has not changed that much.
But the level has and we need to incorporate that in our estimates.
The way we do it is by ignoring these revisions and focusing on the level of
potential GDP and not on its growth rates. We still need to take into account
changes in national account rules or base year that might make the two numbers
not fully comparable. In order to deal with these issues, we apply a correction
factor to the potential output figures based on the revisions done to the latest
GDP data from the perspective of the earlier vintage of the WEO being used. For
example, in the calculation above for the forecast error for potential GDP in 2009
from the perspective of the April 2007 vintage, we rebase the potential output
series found in the April 2007 database by the following factor:
����
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����
����
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺����

We use 2006 as the year where the GDP data is known in April 2007 and look at
the ratio of GDP in 2006 as calculated in the April 2007 and April 2016 vintages
to make the potential output series comparable across the two databases.

32

Once this correction is applied we can calculate the forecast error as:

Where

����
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹���,����

=

����
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃����
− 𝑃𝑃𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 ∗ �,����
����

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ∗ �,����
����

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ∗ �,����
����

is the rebased series of the forecast of potential GDP from the April 2007 vintage
using the adjustment factor.
