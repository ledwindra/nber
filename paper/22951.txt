Interfirm Relationships and Business Performance

JEL No. D22,L14,O12,O14
ABSTRACT
We organized business associations for the owner-managers of randomly selected young Chinese
firms to study the effect of business networks on firm performance. We randomized 2,800 firms
into small groups whose managers held monthly meetings for one year, and into a “no-meetings”
control group. We find that: (1) The meetings increased firm revenue by 8.1 percent, and also
significantly increased profit, factors, inputs, the number of partners, borrowing, and a
management score; (2) These effects persisted one year after the conclusion of the meetings; and
(3) Firms randomized to have better peers exhibited higher growth. We exploit additional
interventions to document concrete channels. (4) Managers shared exogenous business-relevant
information, particularly when they were not competitors, showing that the meetings facilitated
learning from peers. (5) Managers created more business partnerships in the regular than in other
one-time meetings, showing that the meetings improved supplier-client matching. (6) Firms
whose managers discussed management, partners, or finance improved more in the associated
domain, suggesting that the content of conversations shaped the nature of gains.

Introduction

Much research has focused on barriers to firm growth that act at the level of the individual firm,
such as limits to borrowing or lack of managerial skills. But firms do not operate in a vacuum:
business relationships, which provide information, training, referrals, intermediate inputs and other
services, are potentially central. Yet, because of various networking frictions, relationships may not
form to maximize the net benefit of these services. A small literature going back to McMillan and
Woodruff (1999) has started to explore these issues.1 But we still know little about the effect of an
exogenous increase in business networks on firm performance, about the underlying mechanisms,
and about policies that can induce such a change.
We investigate these issues using a large scale field experiment in China, in which we organized experimental business associations for the owner-managers of small and medium enterprises
(SMEs). Building on existing approaches to induce variation in business connections—especially
those by Fafchamps and Quinn (2016) and Bernard, Moxnes and Saito (2015)—we created networks through regular meetings which had the explicit purpose of fostering business interactions.
We also introduced additional interventions to learn about mechanisms. Our main findings are
that business meetings substantially and persistently improved firm performance in many domains,
and that learning and partnering were active mechanisms. These results suggest that differences
in business networks may explain some of the large observed heterogeneity in firm performance
(Syverson 2011). And, since SMEs produce a large share of the output in developing countries,
they also suggest that organizing business associations can meaningfully contribute to private sector
development.
In Section 2 we introduce our experimental design. In the summer of 2013 we invited micro,
small and medium enterprises established in the preceding 3 years in Nanchang, China to participate
in business associations. From 2,800 firms which expressed interest, we randomly selected 1,480
and randomized their owner-managers into meetings groups with 10 managers each. We informed
the remaining 1,320 firms—the control group—that there was no room for them in the meetings.
Managers in each group were encouraged to hold monthly self-organized meetings. These meet1

We review this literature in detail below.

ings were intensive: managers would typically visit the firm of a group member, take a tour, and
then spend hours discussing business-relevant issues. The program lasted for one year.2 We surveyed the firms in 2013 summer before the intervention (baseline), in 2014 summer shortly after
the end of the intervention (midline), and in 2015 summer one year after the end of the intervention (endline). In the surveys we collected information on (1) Firm characteristics including
sales, employment, borrowing, and other balance sheet variables; (2) Managerial characteristics,
including—in the midline and endline surveys—management practices; (3) Firm networks and the
type of interaction. We also have brief logs about the topics discussed in each meeting.
We introduced three additional interventions to learn about mechanisms. First, to explore peer
effects, we created variation in the composition of groups by sector and size. Second, to document
learning, similarly to Duflo and Saez (2003) and Cai, de Janvry and Sadoulet (2015) we provided
randomly chosen managers with information about two different financial products.3 Third, to
explore the role of meeting frequency, building on Feigenberg, Field and Pande (2013) we organized
one-time cross-group meetings for a random subset of managers.
In Section 3 we present results on the effect of the meetings. We first explore the overall
impact of the intervention. Our basic regression is a firm fixed effects specification which effectively
compares the within-firm growth rate in the meetings groups to that in the control group. We
estimate that by the midline survey the sales of treatment firms increased by a significant 7.8 log
points more than that of control firms, corresponding to a treatment effect on sales of 8.1 percent.
This effect persisted to the endline survey: the baseline-to-endline change in log sales was 9.8 points
higher in treatment than in control firms (p < 0.05), corresponding to a long-term treatment effect
on sales of 10.3 percent. We also find significant and persistent effects for profits, production factors
(employment and fixed assets), and inputs (materials and utility cost). These results show that the
meetings had large and persistent positive effects on firm performance.
Turning to intermediate outcomes, we find that the meetings significantly and persistently
2

As an incentive to participate, after the conclusion of the intervention we gave managers who answered our
surveys and attended the meetings a certificate which provided access to certain government services. We also gave
the certificate to managers in the control group who answered our surveys.

We also provided the information to random control firms to ensure that the same share of treatment and control
firms are directly informed.

increased the number of clients, the number of suppliers, as well as formal and informal borrowing.
Using only the midline and endline survey—as data on it was not collected in the baseline—we
also find that the meetings significantly and persistently increased management practices. There
were also positive effects on innovation. Besides confirming the beneficial effects of the meetings,
these results suggest three possible underlying mechanisms. Learning from peers which may have
improved management and innovation; better firm-to-firm matching which may have created new
partnerships; and improved access to finance. However these results do not yet conclusively identify
the mechanisms. It is also possible that the meetings created growth though a different channel,
which then led to an increase in intermediate outcomes.
We next explore the role of peer composition. We view this analysis as an internal consistency
test that further supports our identification: all plausible mechanisms operating through business
networks imply that having better peers should improve performance. We proxy peers’ quality
with their size (employment) at baseline, and ask whether firms randomized into groups with larger
peers grow faster. We find significant and persistent peer effects on most outcomes, including sales,
profits, an estimate for total factor productivity, the number of clients, and management practices;
but not on employment or the number of suppliers. Overall these findings confirm, using a different
source of variation, our basic result that business networks improve firm performance.
We discuss three main issues with identification and interpretation. One concern is that experimenter demand effects may drive the results. Contradicting this explanation, we find essentially
no difference between the self-reported and the actual book value of sales. And demand effects are
unlikely to explain peer effects, which are identified using only firms in the treatment. A second
concern is that the meetings may have improved access to government officials. This logic also
cannot easily explain peer effects, or the gains in management and innovation. A third issue is collusion: perhaps firms in the meetings coordinated price increases. But standard models of collusion
would predict a reduction in quantity, contradicting the positive effects on factors and inputs; and
collusion cannot explain the gains in management.
In Section 4 we study mechanisms. We use our additional interventions to cleanly document
two channels for improvement: learning and partnering. And we present suggestive evidence from

3

the meeting logs on a third channel: access to finance. We begin with learning and show that the
meetings diffused business relevant information. We do this using the intervention in which we
provided information about two different financial products (independently) to randomly chosen
managers. For both products, we find that uninformed managers in groups with a higher informed
share were much more likely to apply, providing direct evidence on learning as a mechanism. We also
show that for the more rival product, a cash grant for the firm—which could help a competitor’s
business—diffusion was weaker in groups in which firms on average had more competitors. In
contrast, for the less rival product, a savings opportunity for the manager, diffusion was not weaker
in groups with higher competition. These results suggest that the diffusion of rival information
was limited by product market competition. In independent work, Hardy and McCasland (2016)
find that the diffusion of a new weaving technique in Ghana was lower in treatments with higher
experimentally induced competition. Taken together, their findings and ours highlight a novel
friction in technology diffusion: the endogenous (dis)incentive to transmit information.
We document evidence on the second mechanism—improved access to suppliers and clients—
using the intervention of one time cross-group meetings. We show that firms established a significant
1.2 more direct partnerships—supplier, client, or joint venture—with their regular group members
than with their cross-group members. Firms also got referrals from a significant 2.1 more peers in
their regular group than in their cross-group. These results are direct evidence that the meetings
reduced the cost of partnering: this is why more new connections came from the regular, and not the
cross group. We also find that in hypothetical trust games managers exhibited significantly higher
trust towards their regular than their cross-group partners, suggesting that trust built through
repeated interactions may have contributed to the improved partnering we observe.
Finally we exploit the meeting logs to document suggestive evidence that the content of conversations affected the domain of improvement. We focus on three domains: management, partnering,
and access to finance. For both management and access to finance, we find that firms improved
more in a domain if their managers were in groups that discussed that domain. In contrast firms did
not improve more in a domain if their managers were in groups that discussed different domains.
This fact rules out the most plausible alternative explanation that better groups discussed more

4

topics and improved in more domains. We find broadly similar but insignificant effects for partnering. Our results suggest that the learning mechanism may have contributed to the improvements
in management, and also that access-to-finance may have been a third mechanism.
In the concluding Section 5 we discuss several implications of the results. We begin with a
cost-benefit calculation. We estimate that for the average firm the profit gains from the meetings
exceeded the wage cost of attending them by a factor of 5. Thus the intervention was extremely
cost effective. A natural question then is why managers did not organize meetings for themselves.
There are several possible reasons. There could be significant search costs and trust barriers in
organizing meetings; there may be a public good problem if these costs fall on a single organizer;
and, paralleling the argument of Bloom, Eifert, Mahajan, McKenzie and Roberts (2013a), managers
may have underestimated the gains from business associations.
We then compare our impacts to other interventions. Business training is often estimated to
have modest and insignificant effects on firm performance (McKenzie and Woodruff 2014). For
intensive and personalized management consulting Bloom et al. (2013a) estimate a productivity
gain of 17%. We find smaller effects—an 8 percent sales increase—but our intervention is cheaper
and highly cost effective. Their results and ours suggest that intensive interventions may have
a higher chance of improving performance, perhaps through a ‘’demonstration effect” of directly
observing superior business practices. And the fact that both their sample and our sample was
selected suggests that interventions may have a large effect when participants are interested in
improving their business. We conclude that organizing regular business meetings for such firms can
be an effective tool for private sector development.4
Our work builds on and contributes to three main literatures. Our research questions are
most related to the work on firm-to-firm interactions. Theories in this area include Acemoglu,
Carvalho, Ozdaglar and Tahbaz-Salehi (2012), Antras and Chor (2013), Oberfield (2013) and Eaton,
Kortum and Kramarz (2015), who explore the aggregate and efficiency implications of supply chain
networks. Evidence from observational data suggest that business networks can improve several firm
outcomes, including access to credit (McMillan and Woodruff 1999, Khwaja, Mian and Qamar 2011,
4

One example of a somewhat similar policy intervention involving large firms and government agencies is the
“Mesas ejecutivas” program in Peru (Ministerio de la Produccion del Peru 2016).

Haselmann, Schoenherr and Vig 2016), managerial compensation policy (Shue 2013), investment
performance (Hochberg, Ljungqvist and Lu 2007) and access to business partners (Bernard et
al. 2015, Bernstein, Giroud and Townsend 2016).5 There is almost no experimental evidence on
the impact of firm networks, except for the pioneering study by Fafchamps and Quinn (2016)
who document the diffusion of some management practices through connections created by joint
committee membership. Our contribution to this literature is to experimentally evaluate the impact
of business networks on a broad range of firm outcomes, and to identify specific mechanisms.
Our methodology and policy results build on a literature that uses experiments to study private
sector development. De Mel, McKenzie and Woodruff (2008) measure the return to capital in
microenterprises. Several papers reviewed in McKenzie and Woodruff (2014) study the effects
of business training. Bloom et al. (2013a) and Bruhn, Karlan and Schoar (2013) measure the
impact of management consulting, and Brooks, Donovan and Johnson (2016) evaluate a business
mentoring program. We contribute to this work with a large-scale experiment on the key but
understudied segment of SMEs; and with evaluating the new policy intervention of organizing
business associations.
Our results on mechanisms relate to a literature on network effects in economics. This includes
research on peer effects, information diffusion in networks, network-based referrals, and networkbased trust.6 We contribute to this work by documenting peer effects, referrals, and the role of trust
in the new domain of managerial networks; and especially to the work on information diffusion by
highlighting—together with Hardy and McCasland (2016)—the new mechanism that competition
can limit the transmission of rival information.

Also related is the work about agglomeration effects, reviewed in Duranton and Puga (2004) and Rosenthal and
Strange (2004).

See for example Sacerdote (2001) on peer effects, Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo and Jackson (2013) on information diffusion, Ioannides and Loury (2004) on referrals, and Karlan, Mobius, Rosenblat and Szeidl (2009) on trust.
We review these literatures in more detail when we discuss the specific results below.

Context, experimental design and data

2.1

Context

Our experimental site was Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi province, located in southeastern
China. In 2014 the city had a population of around 5 million people, and a GDP of 58 billion
dollars, which ranked it as the 19th among the 32 capital cities in China. Nanchang was growing
fast before the start of our study, with over 30,000 microenterprises and SMEs established during
2010-2013.
We conducted our intervention in collaboration with the Commission of Industry and Information Technology (CIIT) in Nanchang, one of the main government departments in charge of private
sector development.

2.2

Interventions

Basic experiment. In the summer of 2013, through CIIT we invited all microenterprises and SMEs
established in the preceding 3 years in Nanchang to participate in business associations. Around
5,400 firms expressed interest. We randomly selected 2,800 firms from this pool as our study sample.
Almost all of these firms were owner managed, and from here on we refer to the CEO of a firm
simply as the manager. Out of the study sample we randomly selected 1,480 firms—the treatment
group—and randomized them into meetings groups with 10 firms each.7 We then informed the
1,320 control firms that there was no room for them in the meetings.
The managers in each meeting group were expected to meet once a month, every month, for one
year. We organized the first meetings, in collaboration with CIIT, in August 2013. For this first
meeting only, we offered the managers in each group print material containing business-relevant
information. We gave the same material to control firms as well. CIIT chose one of the managers in
each meeting group to be the group leader. This person was responsible for planning and scheduling
all subsequent monthly meetings. For each meeting, the group leader took notes on the location,
7

To ensure that the managers of the firms in each meeting group were relatively close to each other, we divided
the study area into local regions, and randomized firms into the treatment and control group, and treatment firms
into meetings groups, at the local region level.

date, topics discussed, and the main takeaways, and submitted the log to us.
According to informal reports and the meeting logs, in most groups members took turns in
hosting the meetings. In a typical meeting, group members toured the firm of the host manager,
and then spent hours discussing business relevant issues. Typical meetings lasted for about half
a day. Common discussion topics included borrowing, management, suppliers and clients, hiring,
recent government policies, and marketing.
To provide incentives to participate, we offered managers who answered our surveys and attended at least 10 out of the 12 monthly meetings a certificate from CIIT. The certificate offered improved access to government services, including government funding and admission to entrepreneur
training programs at local universities. In addition the certificate may have been viewed as a
potential signal of firm quality. We also offered managers of firms in the control group the same
certificate if they answered our surveys. We gave the certificate to the firms after the conclusion of
the one-year program.
Additional interventions. To improve identification and explore mechanisms we also introduced
three additional interventions. First, to help measure peer effects, we created variation in the composition of groups by size and sector. Almost all of our firms were from two sectors, manufacturing
and services. In each region, we created two firm size categories, “small” and “large” by the median
employment of our sample firms in that region. We then created four kinds of groups: small firms
in the same sector; large firms in the same sector; mixed size firms in the same sector; and mixed
size and mixed sector. We randomized treated firms into these groups in each region.
Second, to measure information diffusion, we gave information about two financial products to
randomly chosen managers. The first product was a funding opportunity for the firm, the second a
savings opportunity for the manager. The firm funding opportunity allowed managers to apply for a
government grant of up to RMB 200,0000 (about USD 32,000). Because it could help the business
of a competitor’s firm, managers may have viewed this product to be rival and may have been
unwilling to discuss it with competitors. The private savings opportunity offered an annual return
of almost 7%, which was higher than the typical return of available high-yield saving products
in the market (about 4%). Because it could not directly help a competitor’s business, managers

8

may have viewed this product to be less rival and may have been more willing to discuss it with
competitors.8
We distributed information about each product via phone calls and text messages to 0%, 50% or
80% of the managers in each meeting group. We randomly assigned about one third of the meeting
groups to each of these three treatment intensities.9 We also distributed the information to 40% of
control firms to ensure that the same share of treatment and control firms have the information.
We randomized and distributed the information independently for the two products.
Finally, to learn about the role of meeting frequency, we organized one time cross-group meetings. We randomized 439 managers in the meetings treatment into 43 “cross-groups” of around
10 managers each, such that no two managers from the same meetings group were in the same
cross-group. Each cross-group met once, in February 2014. And in the 2014 midline survey we
asked managers to play hypothetical trust games (with large payoffs) with a randomly selected
regular group member as well as with a randomly selected cross-group member.

2.3

Surveys

We conducted a baseline survey before the intervention in 2013 summer, a midline survey after the
intervention in 2014 summer, and an endline survey in 2015 summer. Our enumerators conducted
the surveys in person with the managers. Because the fiscal year in China ends in June, data in
the baseline survey refer to the fiscal year before the intervention; data in the midline survey refer
to the fiscal year that almost fully overlaps with the meetings; and data in the endline survey refer
to the fiscal year after the conclusion of the meetings.
In the surveys we collected information from both treatment and control firms about the following groups of variables. (1) Firm characteristics. Profits, sales, costs, utility expenses, spending on
intermediate inputs, and other balance-sheet variables. For sales we have two measures: besides the
self-reported value in the survey we also have the actual book value. To obtain it, at the conclusion
of the survey our enumerators asked the accountant of the firm to physically show the value in
the firm’s book. (2) Managerial characteristics. Demographics, measures of wellbeing, and—in the
8
9

Both products were in limited supply.
We stratified this randomization by group type.

9

midline and endline survey—questions on management. These questions were adapted from the
Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) management survey and covered five areas of management: evaluation and communication of employee performance, targets and responsibilities, attracting and
incentivizing talent, process documentation and development, and delegation. (3) Firm networks.
The number and type of business connections (supplier, buyer, joint venture) both within and outside the group, and information on the nature of any relationship with group members (competitor
or some type of partner).10 (4) Whether managers applied for the funding opportunities about
which we had distributed information. (5) Other outcomes measuring product innovation, business
with the government, and employee satisfaction. We included questions on these outcomes only in
the endline survey.

2.4

Summary statistics and randomization checks

Table 1 shows basic summary statics from the baseline survey. The first three columns report
the means for all firms, treatment firms, and control firms; and the final columns reports the
difference between treatment and control firms. Panel A on firm characteristics shows that in 2013
average firm age was about 2.3 years, and that 98%of firms were domestic private enterprises.11
About half of the firms were in manufacturing and 48% in services.12 Consistent with self-selection
of better firms into our sample, in spite of their young age these firms employed on average 36
workers. But the large standard deviation of employment (86) shows that there was much crossfirm heterogeneity.
Panel B presents managerial characteristics. The vast majority of managers were men, and in
2013 they were on average 41 years old. Almost a third of them had a college education. Many
managers had government connections: 23% had worked either in government or in state-owned
firms, and 20% of them were members of the Communist Party of China. Managers reported to
10

Because the firms in each group came from a large pool, there were essentially no preexisting in-group partnerships
at baseline.
11
The remaining two percent were either privatized formerly state-owned firms, whose CEOs were appointed by the
government; or foreign-owned firms. In both cases the local CEO was responsible for essentially all business-relevant
decisions and is the person we label the manager.
12
Among others, firms in the manufacturing sector included textile, automobile and furniture companies; and firms
in the service sector included restaurants, wholesalers, and transportation companies.

have been very busy: they worked on average 9.6 hours during weekdays and 7.6 hours during
weekends. That in spite of their intense schedules managers were willing to participate in the
meetings suggests that they thought them to be valuable. There are no significant differences
between the treatment and control firms in any of the variables in the table, confirming that our
randomization is valid.

borrowed from formal banks and 12% borrowed from friends and relatives in the previous year.
The relatively large share of informal borrowing suggests frictions in getting formal loans, perhaps
because they often require collateral or government guarantors.
Panel C reports data on accounting measures of firm performance. The average net profit was
RMB 792,300 (about USD 130,000), but this masks a lot of heterogeneity as indicated by the large
standard deviation. A unitless measure of heterogeneity is the coefficient of variation (standard
deviation divided by the mean), which for log sales is 0.36, higher than but roughly comparable
to the corresponding value of 0.26 in the Banerjee and Duflo (2014) administrative data on midsized Indian firms. Consistent with the randomization, there are no significant differences between
treatment and control firms in any of these variables.

Finally, Panel D shows that between the baseline and the endline survey about 10.9% of firms
in our sample closed down and also that 9.2% disappeared due to attrition. There are no significant
differences in either the exit or the attrition rate between treatment and control firms.
The share of firms which did not change their report of sales, the number of suppliers, and the
number of clients between the baseline and the endline survey is 1%, 4%, and 10%, respectively.
These relatively low values suggest that basic misreporting in the survey was infrequent.

Business meetings and firm performance

In this section we measure the impact of the meetings. We show that the meetings improved firm
performance in many domains, and also that firms randomized into groups with better peers grew
faster. Then in the next section we will study mechanisms.

3.1

Effect of meetings

Graphical evidence. We begin the analysis with graphical evidence that highlights some key patterns
in the data. Figure 1 plots the kernel density of log sales for the treatment and the control
group, both at baseline and at endline. Given that the surveys were conducted at fiscal year end,
the baseline data refer to the twelve-month period before the start, and the endline data refer
to the twelve-month period after the end of the one-year meetings intervention. The left panel
13

shows that—consistent with the randomization—before the intervention the distribution of log
sales was similar in the treatment and control groups. The right panel shows that one year after
the intervention the distribution of log sales for treatment firms was—slightly but visibly—to the
right of that for control firms. The shift is present for a large part of the domain, showing that the
meetings treatment increased sales for a substantial range of firm sizes. And while the shift seems
visually small, this is mainly because the large heterogeneity of log sales demands a wide range on
the horizontal axis in the figure.
To quantify the shift, and to explore other outcomes, we now turn to regressions.
Empirical strategy. Our main empirical specification is
yit = const + β1 · M idlineit + β2 · Endlineit
+ β3 · M eetingsit × M idlineit + β4 · M eetingsit × Endlineit
+ F irm f. e. + εit . (1)
Here i indexes firms, t indexes years, and yit is an outcome variable such as log sales. Meetingsit is
an indicator for the treatment, which is time-invariant and equals one if the firm is invited to the
meetings. Midlineit is an indicator for the midline survey wave and Endlineit is an indicator for the
endline survey wave. The firm fixed effects take out time-invariant heterogeneity, including whether
the firm is in the meetings treatment or in the control group. This specification is analogous to the
one used by De Mel et al. (2008).
Our coefficients of interest are β3 and β4 , which measure—given the fixed effects specification—
the differential change over time in the outcome variable in the treatment group relative to that in
the control group. Intuitively, β3 is the treatment-induced additional growth in y between baseline
and midline; and β4 is the treatment-induced additional growth in y between baseline and endline.
These coefficients can be compared to β1 and β2 which measure the growth in y for the firms in
the control group. The key identification assumption is that firms in the treatment group did not
have systematically different trajectories from those in the control group for reasons other than
the meetings treatment itself. Because the treatment is randomized, any potential omitted variable
would have to be a “side-effect” of the treatment itself, such as better access to government officials.

We will discuss possible omitted variables as we present the results, and also in Section 3.3 below.
Because the treatment can induce correlated errors within a group, for inference we cluster
standard errors at the level of the meeting group for treatment firms, and at the level of the firm
for control firms. And to control for potential outliers, in specifications in which the dependent
variable is neither binary nor a share between zero and one, we winsorize the regressions at 1% in
both tails of the distribution.13
Results. Table 3 presents results for a range of firm performance measures. Start with column
1 where the outcome is log sales, and consider first the effect at midline, i.e., the fiscal year in
which the meetings took place. While log sales in the control group increased, from baseline, by
an insignificant 0.004, log sales in the meetings treatment increased by an additional significant
0.078, corresponding to a treatment effect on sales of 8.1%. This effect persisted in the fiscal year
after the meetings program ended: the coefficient of the interaction between Meetings and Endline
shows that sales growth between baseline and endline was 9.8 log points higher for treated than
for control firms, corresponding to a 10.3% treatment effect on sales. Similarly, column 2 shows
that average profits increased by a significant RMB 257,500 (about $36,000) more in the treatment

group than in the control group by midline, and the difference persisted by endline. These results
show large impacts for two key business-relevant outcomes.
The remaining columns look at various components of the production process. Columns 3 and
4 show evidence on factors. We estimate significant and persistent treatment effects on both employment and fixed assets, ranging from 5 to 12 log points. Columns 5 and 6 focus on intermediate
inputs. The treatment effect on materials is an insignificant but large 8.2 log points by midline,
which increases further to a significant 12.3 log points by endline. The treatment effect on utility
cost has a similar magnitude and is highly significant throughout. Finally, column 7 shows the
impact on total factor productivity which we inferred using coefficients from estimating a revenue
production function in the control group. We find insignificant effects which are small at midline
and 3.6 log points at endline. We do not read much into this result, because it is imprecise and
subject to the identification problems associated with estimating production functions using revenue data (De Loecker 2011). To avoid those problems, below we focus on particular productivity
components which we can directly measure.14 Overall we conclude that Table 3 shows large and
persistent benefits from the meetings.
Table 4 explores intermediate outcomes that may have contributed to firm growth, as well as
some alternative explanations. Columns 1 and 2 show highly significant and persistent treatment
effects on the number of clients and suppliers, ranging between 8 and 12 log points. Column 3
shows that firms in the meetings treatment were significantly more likely to take out loans following
the intervention. For simplicity here we group formal and informal loans into one indicator, but
separately estimating treatment effects shows significant gains for both of them. These results can
be interpreted in two ways. One possibility is that the meetings helped firms connect with more
business partners and raise more capital, which then contributed to firm growth. An alternative is
that the meetings generated growth through other mechanisms, which then translated into higher
demand for business partners and for capital. In Section 4 we show direct evidence that improved
partnering was one benefit of the meetings.
Column 4 shows the treatment effect on innovation, defined as an indicator for whether the firm

Also note that a 3-4 log point productivity gain could generate the observed growth in sales and factors under
a demand elasticity of 3 which is well within the ballpark of standard estimates (Hsieh and Klenow 2009).

introduced new products or services in that fiscal year. Because we asked about innovation only in
the endline survey, here we estimate a regression without firm fixed effects
yi = const + β4 · M eetingsit × Endlineit + F irm controls + εi .

(2)

Note, because this regression only uses data from the endline survey, replacing the interaction with
the uninteracted M eetings variable would yield the same coefficient β4 . We report it this way purely
to make the table easier to read. Because the treatment is randomized, β4 is identified even in the
absence of firms fixed effects; here from comparing the level (not the growth rate) of innovation
between the treatment and the control group. The firm controls include indicators for the firm’s
region, size category (above or below the median employment in the region), sector (manufacturing
or services), and all their interactions. Because the purpose of innovation is to increase output given
inputs, the significant positive estimate of 5.7 percentage points can be interpreted as evidence for
a productivity gain due to the meetings.
Columns 5 and 6 focus on particular alternative explanations. Column 5 reports the treatment
effect on the difference between the log of self-reported sales and the log of the book value of sales
(which our enumerators took directly from the firm’s book). There is no treatment effect on this

Note: Standard errors clustered at the meeting group level for treated firms and at the firm level for
control firms. Column (1) reports the impact of the treatment on the overall management z-score.
Columns (2)-(6) report the impact on five components of management: evaluation and
communication of employee performance, targets and responsibilities, attracting and incentivizing
talent, process documentation and development, and delegation. All regressions include the

difference, suggesting that experimenter demand effects are unlikely to drive the main results. And
column 6 shows that the tax-to-sales ratio of both treatment and control firms was essentially
unchanged after the intervention. Thus improvement in tax avoidance is unlikely to have been the
channel of the treatment effect.
Finally we turn to the effect of the treatment on management practices. Following Bloom
and Van Reenen (2007) we aggregate the responses to management questions into a single index by
standardizing, averaging and again standardizing them. Because only the follow-up surveys contain
data on management, we estimate an analogous specification to the one we used for innovation,
which does not include firm fixed effects (but is still causally identified):
yi = const+β2 ·Endlineit +β3 ·M eetingsit ×M idlineit +β4 ·M eetingsit ×Endlineit +F irm controls+εi .
(3)
Table 5 reports the results. In column 1, we estimate highly significant treatment effects of
0.21 at both midline and endline, measured in units of the cross-sectional standard deviation of
the overall management score. In columns 2-6 we look at the treatment effect on different areas

18

of management. We find that the intervention improved four of the five areas of management we
surveyed, the only exception being the transparency of the firm’s targets to its employees. Overall,
we conclude that the meetings treatment had a large, persistent and highly significant positive
effect on management practices. Given the argument in Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) and Bloom
et al. (2013a) that management is a component of total factor productivity, this evidence too can
be interpreted as a productivity gain from the meetings.
In sum, the results in Tables 3, 4 and 5 show that the meetings treatment substantially improved firm performance on several margins. The results on innovation and management suggest
genuine productivity gains. And the effects on intermediate outcomes, taken together, suggest three
mechanisms at play: learning from peers which may improved management; improved partnering
which may have increased the number of suppliers and clients; and improved access to finance.

3.2

Group composition and peer effects

We turn to estimate peer effects: whether being grouped with better peers at baseline improves a
firm’s performance. We view this analysis as an internal consistency test, because any mechanism
we can imagine that represents genuine network-based gains predicts that the quality of peers should
matter. Motivated by models such as Melitz (2003) in which productivity determines firm size,
in our basic specification we measure peer quality with peer size (employment) at baseline. Using
only the sample of firms in the meetings groups, our starting point is the following specification:
yit = const + δ1 · M idlineit + δ2 · Endlineit
+ δ3 · M idlineit × log Peer sizeit + δ4 · Endlineit × log Peer sizeit
+ Controls + F irm f. e. + εit . (4)
Here log Peer sizeit is the average of log employment of the other firms in the meeting group of
firm i at baseline, i.e., in the year before the intervention. The controls include the interactions
of Midlineit and Endlineit with a set of firm demographics: indicators for region, sector categories
at baseline (manufacturing or services), size categories at baseline (above or below the regional
median employment), and all their interactions. As conditional on these firm demographics the

groups were randomized, by including their interactions with Midlineit and Endlineit we ensure
that δ3 and δ4 are identified from the exogenous variation in peer size.
Table 6 reports the results for a representative set of final and intermediate outcomes.15 Column
1 shows that firms randomized into groups with 10 log points larger peers experienced an additional
(significant) sales increase of 1.18 log points by midline and 1.66 log points by endline. That is,
roughly, having 10% larger peers increased firm sales by more than 1 percent. Column 2 shows
that 10 log points larger peers also increased firm profits by a significant RMB 36,660 (about USD
5,000) by the midline, an effect which persisted to the endline. However log employment did not
increase significantly. Column 4 suggests that larger peers also improved the firm’s productivity.16
Columns 5 and 6 show the results for suppliers and clients. Firms with 10 log points larger peers
experienced an additional (significant) increase in the number of clients of 0.43 log points by the
midline and 1.08 log points by the endline. However, the point estimate for the number of suppliers
is negative, though small and insignificant.
We next turn to peer effects on management practices. Because the management data is only

In Appendix Table A1 we present the results for all the other outcomes that were included in Tables 3 and 4.
Patterns are similar to the estimates reported in Table 6.

As in Table 3, log productivity is obtained as the residual using production function coefficients estimated from
a regression in the sample of control firms.

20

available in the midline survey, here we estimate
yi = const + δ3 · M idlineit × log Peer sizei + δ4 · Endlineit × log Peer sizei + controls + εi .

(5)

Column 7 in Table 6 reports the results. The coefficient estimate of the midline coefficient (0.21)
shows that 10 log points larger peers resulted in a significant 0.02 standard deviations increase in
management practices. The effect shrinks by half but remains positive and significant one year
after the end of the meetings intervention.
A possible concern with these peer effect regressions is the exclusion bias investigated by Caeyers
and Fafchamps (2016), according to which random assignment into groups mechanically creates a
slight negative correlation between the ex ante characteristics of individuals and their peers. To
address this concern, we re-estimated our peer effect specifications for the control firms—which did
not participate in meetings—using artificial groups created by the same procedure that we had
used to create groups in the treatment. Because meetings were not held by these groups of control
firms we expect no peer effects; but because they were assigned using the same procedure, any
exclusion bias would still affect them. Reassuringly the estimates, shown in Appendix Table A2,
are insignificant and small in all specifications, indicating that exclusion bias is not a major factor
in our specifications.
Why exactly does peer size matter? One possibility is that bigger firms have better management
practices, which then diffuse to peers in the meetings. To explore this effect, we need to measure
peer quality with management practices. Since we had not included management questions in
the baseline survey, we first construct a predicted measure of managerial practices for all firms at
baseline. We do this by regressing, in the midline and endline control sample, the management score
on log sales, log employment, manager education, age, gender, sector, and region indicators. Using
the coefficients we compute a predicted management score for all firms at baseline. Then we estimate
peer effect regressions using peers’ (predicted) management score as a measure of quality. Table 7
shows that firms randomized into groups with peers that had higher (predicted) managerial skills
experienced increases in their sales, profit, productivity, number of clients, and the management
score. Although the (predicted) management score may be correlated with several factors, these
results are consistent with peers’ management skill being one driver of firm growth. A possible

explanation is learning from peers with high management scores. In Section 4 below we present
more direct evidence on the learning channel, and also connect it more tightly to improvements in
management.
Taken together, our findings show that peers’ identity matters: randomly assigned better peers
generate faster firm growth in several domains. Beyond providing internal validity to our previous
estimates, these results also contribute to the large literature on peer effects by establishing such
effects in a new domain, managerial interactions, and showing that they influence several firm-level
outcomes.17

Discussion

Our estimates imply that the meetings had a large effect on firm performance. Here we discuss and
rule out some potential confounds.
Experimenter demand effects. A natural concern is that managers who participated in the meetings felt that they were expected to perform well, and as a result over-reported their performance
17

The work on peer effects includes studies about education (Sacerdote 2001, Carrell, Sacerdote and West 2013),
worker productivity (Mas and Moretti 2009, Bandiera, Barankay and Rasul 2010), loan repayment (Breza 2016),
program participation (Dahl, Lken and Mogstad 2014), as well as neighborhood effects (Chetty, Hendren and Katz
2016), among others. See Jackson (2011) for a review.

in the midline and endline surveys. Several facts suggest that demand effects are unlikely to drive
our results. (i) Table 4 shows that the difference between the self-reported and the book value of
sales does not vary with the treatment. It is unlikely that managers would have manipulated the
sales number in the book—shown to us, without advance notice that we would ask for it, by the
firm’s accountant—because of experimenter demand effects. (ii) Table 3 shows significant treatment effects on utility costs, which are not an obvious performance measure and as a result are less
likely to be manipulated. (iii) Demand effects are unlikely to have driven the results on peer effects
which are identified from variation within the meetings treatment. Those results constitute strong
evidence that the meetings had direct economic impact. (iv) Essentially all treatment effects persisted one year after the meetings had concluded, while experimenter demand effects should weaken
over time.
Side-effects of the meetings. Another concern is that the meetings improved firm growth not
because of interactions between managers, but because of a “side-effect”. One such side-effect is
that firms in the meetings may have had better access to the government through CIIT. Because—
except for the first meeting—managers met without interference from CIIT or us, there is no obvious
forum for regular access to CIIT officials. And since CIIT staff members introduced us to both
the treatment and the control firms, it is not clear that treatment firms had better government
access than control firms. Thus the circumstances of the design make this effect unlikely. Improved
government access also cannot easily explain the positive peer effects: larger peer firms might have
actually crowded out the manager from accessing government officials. We also estimated peer
effect specifications testing whether firms improved more if a larger share of their peers had prior
government working experience, and found no effect (not reported). Finally, it is not fully clear
how access to the government would generate gains in management and innovation.
A second possible side-effect is that firms in the meetings could use either the government
certificate or the fact of the meetings to signal their quality. This logic cannot work with the
formal certificate because it was also given to control firms.18 And it also cannot explain the
positive peer effects.
18

In the survey we also asked for managers’ willingness to pay for the certificate and found no significant difference
between treatment and control in any of the waves.

23

Collusion and business stealing. A third issue is collusion: perhaps firms in the meetings improved performance not because of performance gains but by coordinating price increases. But these
firms were small actors in a large market. Also, as emphasized by Duso, Roller and Seldeslachts
(2014), standard models of collusion predict that the increase in profit is accompanied by a reduction in quantity, contradicting the positive treatment effect on factors and inputs. And collusion
cannot easily explain other gains, such as improved management.
A variant of this concern is that the impacts are the result of business shifting—treatment firms
trading with each other at the expense of outsiders—but do not represent aggregate gains. For
this argument to work, there has to be a benefit for the firms that shift their business. If this is
an economic benefit, then business shifting is just the process of better firms gaining market share
through the logic of creative destruction, and should represent aggregate gains. An alternative
potential benefit, emphasized by Haselmann et al. (2016), is rent extraction. But in our context it
is difficult to see what rents owner-managed firms could obtain by doing business with each other.
Indeed, most of the crony lending documented by Haselmann et al. (2016) is driven by state-owned
banks, which lack a direct profit motive. And again, this argument does not explain the gains in
management or innovation. Overall, we think that in our context any business shifting is most likely
due to the reallocation of factors and inputs to more productive firms and hence does represent
aggregate gains.
Outliers. A final concern is that some results may be driven by a few large firms, and the
impact on the average firm is small. But Figure 1 shows that firms across a range of sizes were
impacted. Moreover, we directly address this concern by winsorizing our main regressions at 1%.
As the winsorized and the non-winsorized regressions yield similar results, we conclude that obvious
outliers are not driving our findings.
Based on this discussion we believe that the most plausible alternative explanations are unlikely
to drive our results, and we conclude that the meetings treatment indeed significantly improved
firm performance.

24

4

Mechanisms

In this section we provide direct evidence on the mechanisms underlying the impact of the meetings.
We use the additional interventions to cleanly document that learning and partnering were active
channels. We then use the meeting logs for suggestive evidence that more fully fleshes out these
channels and also indicates that access to finance was a third channel.

4.1

Learning

We show that the meetings facilitated the diffusion of business relevant information using the
intervention in which we distributed information about two financial products (independently) to
randomly chosen managers. The first product was a firm funding opportunity in the form of a
government grant. Because it could be used to improve a competitor’s business, we expected
that managers would view this product to be rival. The second product was a private savings
opportunity: a high yield investment. We expected that managers would view this product to be
less rival. We randomized the information about the two products independently, and provided it
to the same share of treatment and control firms.
Empirical strategy. We use two main regressions. First, using the full sample of treatment and
control firms in the midline, we estimate, separately for each financial product:
Appliedi = const + γ1 · Infoi + γ2 · (1 − Infoi ) × Meetingsi + γ3 · Infot × Meetingsi + εi .

(6)

Here the dependent variable is an indicator for whether the manager reported in the midline survey
to have applied for the product. The coefficient γ1 measures whether the information treatment
“worked” in increasing the likelihood of application. The coefficient γ2 measures whether uninformed managers in the meetings treatment were more likely to apply than uninformed managers
in the control. A positive γ2 may indicate information diffusion from peers, some of whom were
exogenously informed about the product. But it could also indicate higher demand for funding
due to the growth effect of the meetings. And γ3 measures whether the effect of information on
applications was higher in the meetings treatment: whether the meetings complemented the effect
of information, perhaps through encouragement from peers.
25

To get a more precise measure of diffusion, our second regression uses only the sample of
uninformed managers in the meetings treatment in the year after the intervention:
Appliedi = const + γ4 · Groupmember informedi + γ5 · Competitioni +
γ6 · Groupmember informedt × Competitioni + controls + εi . (7)
Here Groupmember informedi is an indicator of i having at least one peer in her/his group who had
received the information about the product. Given that the information treatment is randomized,
γ4 measures the causal effect of having an informed peer on the decision to apply. Competitioni is
an indicator for a higher-than-median level of product market competition in the group of i. We
define this variable by first computing the average number of (self-reported) in-group competitors of
firms in a group; and then splitting the set of groups by the median of this value. Thus γ5 measures
whether average application rates are lower in more competitive groups, and γ6 the extent to which
diffusion is weaker in more competitive groups. Finally, the controls are indicators for region, sector
categories at baseline (manufacturing or services), size categories at baseline (above or below the
regional median employment), and their interactions. Because the randomization into groups was
conditioned on these variables, by including them we isolate the variation in Competitioni which is
driven by the random variation in group composition.
Results. Table 8 presents results about the diffusion of the firm funding opportunity. The
first two columns show the estimates from regression (6). Column 1, which only includes Infoi ,
shows that being informed increased the likelihood of application by a highly significant 30 percentage points. This confirms that the information treatment worked. Column 2 also includes the
interactions with the meetings treatment. Among uninformed managers, being in the meetings
treatment increased application rates by a highly significant 20 percentage points. This can come
either from information diffusion or from increased demand for funding because of firm growth.
More surprisingly, among informed managers the meetings treatment also increased the probability of application by a significant 7 percentage points, showing that in our context formal funding
and business networks complemented each other. We view this result as an example of a positive
interaction between formal and informal institutions (Fafchamps 2016).

The remaining columns of the table report estimates of regression (7). The significant coefficient
of 0.315 in column 3 shows that having at least one informed group member increased the probability
of application by 31.5 percentage points. This is direct causal evidence that the meetings diffused
information, i.e., the learning channel. Column 4 suggests that on average competition reduced
application rates. And in column 5 the significant and negative interaction effect of −0.173, suggests
that competition reduced the strength of information diffusion about the firm funding product.
Intuitively, managers may have been less willing to share rival information with their competitors.
Overall, these results show that the meetings channeled business relevant information, and also
suggest that diffusion was mediated by the extent of competition.19
19

The fact that we find positive diffusion even in the competitive groups (0.40−0.17 = 0.23 > 0) suggests—similarly
to the model of Stein (2008)—that the benefits of sharing knowledge exceeded the cost of helping competitors in our
context.

In Table 9 we explore the diffusion of information about the private savings opportunity. The
structure is identical to that of the previous table. Column 1 shows that the information treatment
was very effective for this product as well, while column 2 shows that there was no complementarity between networks and a personal financial product. Column 3 presents direct evidence for
information diffusion, while columns 4 and 5 suggest that competition did not affect the strength
of diffusion. Consistent with our prior expectation that it is less rival, the estimates suggest that
competition did not influence the diffusion of information about this product. The fact that competitive groups had lower diffusion only for the rival product supports the interpretation that it
was driven by the unwillingness to share rival information with competitors, not some correlated
omitted factor which generally reduced information diffusion.
Taken together, the results provide direct evidence on the learning-from-peers channel. Beyond
highlighting a concrete mechanism in our setting, these finding also inform a literature studying
28

information diffusion in social networks.20 Our contribution to this work is to demonstrate that
competition may limit the diffusion of rival information. In combination with Hardy and McCasland
(2016) who show in independent work that the diffusion of a new weaving technique in Ghana
was lower in treatments with higher experimentally induced competition, these results highlight
a novel friction in technology diffusion: the endogenous (dis)incentive to transmit information.
This friction may generate a new, as yet unexplored interaction between technology spillovers and
product market rivalry (Bloom, Schankerman and Van Reenen 2013b).

4.2

Partnering

We use the cross-group intervention to document evidence for the partnering mechanism. Our
approach is to compare the number of new connections—referrals and business partnerships—in
the regular groups and in the cross-groups. Because the cross-groups are randomized from the
same pool, unless regular meetings reduced the cost of connecting there is no reason for firms to
establish more connections in their regular group than in their cross-group.
Table 10 uses the sample of managers in the cross-groups and reports the average number of
new connections by group type. Panel A shows the number of referrers—managers who referred
suppliers, clients, partners, and lower-ranking managers. On average each manager had 2.13 more
peers act as referrers in the regular group than in the cross-group, and this difference is highly
significant. Panel B reports the number of direct business partners: suppliers, clients, and firms
engaging in other joint business activities such as joint projects. The average manager had a
significant 1.15 more direct business partners from the regular group than from the cross group.
And Panel C reports average giving in hypothetical trust games played with a randomly chosen
member of the regular group and of the cross-group. Managers exhibited significantly more trusting
behavior towards their peers in the regular group.21
20

Much of this work has explored the diffusion of technology (Bandiera and Rasul 2006, Conley and Udry 2010),
and financial choices (Duflo and Saez 2003, Hong, Kubik and Stein 2004, Banerjee et al. 2013, Cai et al. 2015) in the
social networks of individuals. More recent work on the diffusion of business choices in managerial networks includes
Cohen, Frazzini and Malloy (2008) who study the diffusion of financial information and Fafchamps and Quinn (2016)
who study the diffusion of certain management practices.

We used the following trust question. “Suppose that you are given 100,000 RMB. Out of this, you can choose
to give as much as you want for a business project which is controlled by person X. This project is very successful

These results imply that the meetings reduced the cost of establishing new partnerships, so
that partnering is indeed one of the channels through which they improved firm performance. The
result on trust game behavior suggests that these lower partnering costs may have emerged in part
because repeated meetings created trust between managers. We conclude that lack of trust is likely
to be an important barrier to creating business partnerships in our context.
These results contribute to a literature that studies network-based referrals in the labor market
by documenting referrals in a new domain: managers referring business partners.22 And our result
on trust relates to the research about trust in networks. Karlan et al. (2009) show theoretically that
networks which embed more trust are more useful for making high-value referrals, while Feigenberg
et al. (2013) establish that regular meetings between microfinance borrowers build trust and improve
loan performance. Our findings are consistent with these results and highlight the importance of
trust in firm-to-firm interactions.
Taken together, our results on learning and partnering suggest that the meetings created some
and triples the money you give. All the proceeds go to person X. Person X can then choose to return to you as much
of the money the project earns as he wishes. How much (between 0 and 100K RMB) do you give to person X?”

4.3

Evidence from meeting logs

We use the content of the meeting logs to document suggestive evidence on how conversations
mediated the channels of improvement. Our empirical approach is to regress improvements in a
particular domain on indicators for the group having discussed various domains. We focus on three
domains: management, partnering, and access-to-finance.
Using the meeting logs we create indicators for whether a group discussed a given domain (e.g.,
management) at least twice. We use a threshold of two because almost all groups discussed each
domain at least once. We measure outcomes in the three domains of interest with the management
score, the log of the sum of suppliers and clients, and an indicator for having a (bank or private)
loan. For the latter two outcomes, which are available in all survey waves, our specification is
Outcome in h domainit = const+

3
X

ξj ·Discussed j domaini ×Postt +κ·Postt +Firm f.e.+εit (8)

j=1

which we estimate for the sample of treatment firms using all waves of data. The variable Post is
an indicator for the midline and endline surveys. The coefficient ξh measures the “same-domain”
effect: whether the growth in outcome h was higher in groups which discussed domain h, relative to
groups which did not. And the coefficients ξj when j 6= h measure “cross-domain” effects: whether
the growth in outcome h was higher in groups that discussed domain j 6= h relative to groups that
did not. We expect ξh > ξj .
Because the management data is only available in the midline and endline surveys, when management is the outcome we instead estimate
Management scoreit = const +

discussed it relative to groups which did not, while ξ2 and ξ3 measure whether management score
was higher in groups which discussed partnering, respectively access to finance, relative to groups
which did not. Here too we expect ξ1 > ξ2 , ξ3 .
Table 11 shows the results. Column 1 shows that for management the patterns strongly align
with our hypothesis: the coefficient of discussing management is large and significant while those
of discussing the other domains are small and insignificant. Column 2 shows that for business
partners all coefficients are insignificant, though those of discussing management and partners are
larger than that of discussing finance. And column 3 shows that for access-to-finance the results

32

again align with our hypothesis: the same-domain coefficient is large and significant while the
cross-domain coefficients are small and insignificant.
The natural interpretation of columns 1 and 3 is that discussion of a domain generated improvements in that domain. The omitted variable concern that good managers talk about multiple domains and also improve in multiple domains is addressed by the small and insignificant
cross-domain effects. The patterns for partnering are less clear. The similar-sized coefficients on
discussing partnering and management may reflect that both topics helped firms get more partners, but other interpretations are also possible: for example, that for new partnerships trust is an
additional input which is not included in this specification.
On the whole we interpret these results as suggestive evidence that conversations mediated
the improvements in various domains. This interpretation suggests two new lessons. The management result suggests that the learning-from-peers mechanism may have contributed to the observed
improvements in management. And the credit result suggests that beyond the learning and partnering mechanisms access to finance was a third mechanism. Further research—also in other areas of
economics—about how conversations shape outcomes, and about the determinants of conversation
topics, seems promising to us.

Conclusion

In this paper we used a field experiment with experimental business associations to measure the
effect of business networks on firm performance. We found significant, robust, large, and persistent
effects of the meetings on sales, profits, factors, and inputs, as well as on innovation and management. We also found direct evidence on two mechanisms, learning and partnering, and suggestive
evidence on a third, access to finance. We now turn to discuss some implications of these results.
We begin with a cost benefit analysis. Combining publicly available survey and wage growth
data we estimate the annual wages of managers in our sample to be RMB 812,300.24 This value
24

A survey conducted by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce shows the average earning of private
business owners to be about RMB 200,000 in 2005. We multiplied this value with wage growth in the private sector
between 2005 and 2014 (a factor of 4.06 by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics) to obtain our estimate. A
summary report of the survey is available at http://www.people.com.cn/GB/jingji/42775/3164559.html.

33

also accords with the range locals reported to us informally. Assuming that managers work 200
days a year and that each meeting takes a full day, we estimate the cost of the meetings to be
about RMB 50,000 for our average manager. As Table 3 shows, the average annual profit gain by
the midline survey was about RMB 250,000, or about five times the estimated wage cost. While
there is uncertainty about the precise value of this estimate, it strongly suggests that the meetings
were highly cost affective.
Given this result, a natural question is why the managers did not organize meetings for themselves. There are several possible answers. First, there could be significant search costs and trust
barriers: managers would need to find others who are willing to form groups with unfamiliar people.
Second, there may be a public good problem if the cost of doing this falls on a single organizer.
Third, paralleling the argument of Bloom et al. (2013a), managers may have underestimated the
gains from business associations or from changing business practices.
We next compare our results to the impacts found in other types of interventions. McKenzie
and Woodruff (2014) review several studies evaluating business training and business consulting
interventions. For business training they conclude that—perhaps because of limited power—most
studies do not find a significant impact on sales or profits (see Table 9 in their paper).25 In contrast,
the high-intensity management consulting intervention evaluated by Bloom et al. (2013a) did create
a large productivity increase of 17%. Our 8 percent sales effect is much smaller than this; but our
intervention is cheaper, easier to implement, and highly cost effective. Finally, Brooks et al. (2016)
show that a one-month business mentoring intervention for Kenyan microenterprises led to a 20%
profit effect, which faded during the year after the intervention. The mechanisms they emphasize
are similar to the ones we document, but our effects persisted after one year. We conclude that our
business meetings intervention had surprisingly large effects in comparison to other interventions
that have been evaluated.
Which aspects of the design made the intervention successful? The comparison with the designs
of other studies, and the results on mechanisms, highlight regularities that allow us to formulate
25

Exceptions include Calderon, Cunha and de Giorgi (2013) who find a 20% impact on sales and a 24% impact on
profits; and De Mel, McKenzie and Woodruff (2014) who find a 41% increase in sales and a 43% increase in profits for
start-up businesses. But these estimates are also quite noisy. Our sales and profit impacts fall within their standard
error bands, are more precisely estimated, and are persistent.

34

some hypotheses. First, similar to the Bloom et al. (2013a) study, but unlike many business training
evaluations, our sample of firms was selected. This fact suggests that firm interventions are more
likely to succeed when managers themselves are interested in improving their business; and also
that a possible way to identify such “gazelles” (Fafchamps and Woodruff 2017) may be to use
an explicit recruitment process.26 Second, also paralleling the Bloom et al. (2013a) study, our
intervention was quite intensive. Managers met every month, and combined company visits with
several hours of discussion. This intensity may have contributed in multiple ways. Our findings
on the effect of meeting frequency suggest that it helped build trust. And observing other firms’
operations in practice may have enhanced learning through a “demonstration effect.” Third, our
results on management and information diffusion suggest that managers had gaps of knowledge
that learning could fill. This could be because the firms were young and did not have access to
other sources of business information.
This discussion suggests that the following conditions on the design increase the probability of a
successful business meetings policy. (1) Self-selected pool of firms. (2) Regular intensive meetings.
(3) Young firm age. The discussion also suggests that meetings are more likely to help in contexts
in which the following distortions are important. (4) Contracting problems which increase the value
of trust. (5) Relative lack of alternative sources of business information (e.g., MBA programs). We
hope that these conditions can help guide future interventions and scale-ups and thus contribute
to private sector development.

26
In the context of our meetings program, recruiting good firms has not only the direct benefit that they may
respond to the treatment, but also the indirect benefit that—through peer effects—they generate higher growth for
other participants.
