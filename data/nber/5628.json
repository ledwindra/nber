A country can raise its total factor productivity by investing in R&D.  But countries can also boost their productivity by trading with other countries that have large stocks of knowledge from their cumulative R&D activities.  We use a special version of MULTIMOD that incorporates R&D spillovers among industrial countries and from industrial countries to developing countries. Our simulations suggest that R&D, R&D spillovers, and trade play important roles in boosting growth in industrial and developing countries.\n\n",
