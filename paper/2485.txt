Monopoly Wealth and International Debt

ABSTRACT

When rents generated by government policies are perceived as
permanent, the rights to earn them may be capitalized as assets

that form a component of nonhuman wealth. The existence of such
assets raises international indebtedness, while shifts in policy
that increase or reduce the importance of such rents can generate
movements in the current account that are correlated with the

real exchange rate. Because the elimination of policies that
generate rents imposes a capital loss that is born entirely by
generations currently alive, while the benefit of the removal of
a distortion is shared between those alive and unborn
generations, a possibility is that such a reform can reduce the

expected lifetime welfare of everyone alive. If monopoly exists
in the provision of nontraded goods then there may be several
steady states that can be Pareto ranked.

The effects of rents created by government policies have
been a major concern of the theory of political economy in the

last decade. This work follows from Tullock's (1967) and
Krueger's (1974) seminal concept of rent seeking as a
resource—using activity that provides access to rents in the

economy. Because this activity in itself absorbs productive
resources, the consequences of rent—creating policies can go far
beyond their direct allocative and redistributional effects.1
The analysis of this paper takes as its point of departure
the observation that entitlements to rents created by government

policy can be capitalized in asset values. The presence of these
assets as a form of nonhuman wealth can therefore have
significant implications for the dynamic behavior of the economy.
In particular, by displacing other forms of wealth in national
portfolios, the existence of monopoly can increase international
indebtedness.

Bhagwati and Srinavasan (1980) and Bhagwata (1982) have

introduced the related notions of revenue seeking and
directly-unproductive—profit (DUP) seeking and examine their
implictions for a number of issues in the theory of commercial
policy. Other important contributions to the literature are by
Brock and Magee (1978,1980), Buchanan, Tullock and Tollison
(1980), Findlay and Wellisz (1982), and Hillman and Riley (1987).
Tollison (1982) and Bhagwati, Brecher, and Srinivasan (1984)
provide overviews of work in the area. This literature, to my
knowledge, has not considered the implications of rents for
capital accumulation.

2

The portfolio implications of monopoly rents have received
little attention. An important exception is Laitner's (1982)
analysis of the effect of monopoly on the capital stock in an

overlapping generations economy. Laitner shows, in a closed
economy, that the presence of capitalized monopoly rents reduces
welfare in steady state by displacing capital in individualst
portfolios, and that this effect may quantitatively overwhelm the
cost arising from static resource misallocation.2
The analysis here concerns the implications of domestic

monopoly for the current account and for foreign indebtedness. A
particular reason for this focus is to illustrate the effect on
foreign debt of policies that affect the size of rents generated

in the economy. Governments in a number of the large debtor
countries have pursued policies that appear to create significant
rents domestically.

Indonesia provides an example. A common practice has been
to grant monopolies to importers as well as to domestic producers

of a number of industrial commodities. In 1985, for example, of
5229 coomodity classification numbered items, importation of 1484
were restricted to holders of government licenses.

While alive, individuals earn a constant wage w. Individual
nonhuman wealth takes the form of claims on firms, or direct
claims on capita]. or land. The value of a firm is in turn

determined by the value of land and capital that it owns and the
present discounted value of the current and anticipated future
rents to which it has claim. Since there is no uncertainty, with
perfect foresight portfolio arbitrage will ensure that each asset

pays a return r*. As in Yaari's and Blanchard's

Since the reform has no implications for steady—state

not change national wealth transitionally, either. When it

corresponding to foreign ownership of domestic monopolies.
If reform is expected, however, then the anticipated change

Qfltradeaded Goods and

Multiple Eg1i1ibrj

The discussion up to this point has

posited that the number

of Commodities freely traded

internationally is sufficient for
international commodity prices to determine
factor rewards
independently of domestic market Cofiditions
Introducing
nontraded goods can break this independence,
thereby introducing
the Possibility of multiple equilibrj,
some of which strictly
dominate others in terms of Pareto
efficiency.
To illustrate this
PossibIlIty, consider flow a situation in
which legal prohibitions or natural barriers
prevent trade in
industrial commodities, but the agricultur

commodity is freely

traded. For

concreteness continue to assume that all industrial
commodities are
monopolistically supplied and that the number of
such commodities is large.
In the absence of

international arbitrage opportunities for
industrial commodities, the cost of production
will typically
differ from the world
price of unity. Denote the unit cost of
production as a
of factor rewards as a(w,r*,p).
Monopolistic suppliers who take their rivals'
output prices and
factor costs as given will establish a
price:

p =

a(w,r*,p)/9

industrial commodities are nontraded,
Since, by assumptions

p =

Together, these six conditions

determine factor rewards w

of the

of the
world interest rate r* and of
domestic expenditure c. In steady
state, c continues to be given by the Condition:

C =

This condition and the six

conditIon6 above fully characterize the steady state of the

economy. There may be more than one set of values for w,
p. K,
L1, K', and T' that satisfy these equations.
Each set may
correspond to different equilibria that can be Pareto—ranked, as
the following example illustrates.

A movement from the low to the high_wage equilibrium

the value of land to zero. it also increases the value
of

in this case land—owners

can be compensated for their capital

loss on land by

receiving the capitalized value of the additional
monopoly rents. With such a transfer scheme in effect a movement

It is ambiguous as to whether net international indebtedness
is greater or less in the
high—wage steady state relative to the
low—wage one. At the higher wage national wealth is greater, but
SO, typically, is the value of domestic
capital and the value of

wealth. (The amount of

monopoly rents are higher, but land is

worth less.)

VI. Extensions

To focus attention on

several basic points I have made a
number of specific assumptions about the nature of the
environment under consideration
First, I have ignored potential

credit rationing and default

on international debt. For one thing, introducing these
considerations would break the independence between domestic
monopoly and the level of domestic
of nontraded goods.

Finally, and perhaps of greatest potential
interest, I have
not explored the determinants of the
distribution of claims on
monopoly across the Population. The discussion
of the Political
Popularity of liberalization
pointed to this distribution as
affecting whether voters would favor or
oppose liberalization.

The distribution of assets in the

economy is consequently not
neutral even though, when a given
policy is in place, all assets
earn the same rate of return.

Substituting

this expression into the expression for retailer l's

aC(p. —1)/p.

Combining the first-order Condition for a maximum with the
condition that, in a symmetric equilibri, all monopolistic
retailers charge the same price (so that p1 =

the price charged by a monopolistic retailer is determined
by the
expression:
