ABSTRACT
The majority of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China were privatized through ownership
reforms over the last two decades. Using a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large
enterprises in China between 1998 and 2013, we show that privatized SOEs continue to benefit
from government support relative to private enterprises. Compared to private firms that were
never state-owned, privatized SOEs are favored by low interest loans and government subsidies.
These differences are more salient with the Chinese government’s trillion-dollar stimulus package
introduced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Moreover, both SOEs and privatized SOEs
significantly under-perform in profitability compared to private firms. Nevertheless there are
clear improvements in performance post-privatization. The tiger can change its stripes; however,
the government’s behavior seems to be sticky.

Introduction

Conventional wisdom suggests that privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) should
reduce state favoritism, increase competition, and enhance firm performance. Summarizing the
literature, Shleifer (1998) concluded that private ownership should generally be preferred to
public ownership when the incentives to innovate and to contain costs are strong. Ehrlich et al.
(1994) and Karpoff (2001) reached similar conclusions based on the argument that the principal
of SOEs (i.e., the government) either cannot or does not choose to monitor the managers
properly.
Empirical analyses, however, have produced mixed or ambiguous results. For example,
DeWenter and Malatesta (2001) find that, among the 500 largest firms globally in 1975, 1985,
and 1995, private enterprises have significantly lower costs and higher profits than SOEs. Yet
when they examine a subsample of privatized firms, they find inconsistent results: performance
increases post-privatization, while leverage and employment increase mainly pre-privatization.
Market returns from privatization are positive in Hungary, Poland, and the United Kingdom but
insignificant elsewhere.
One explanation for the conflicting evidence is that efficiency gains from privatization
depend on a variety of internal and external factors. Internally, Shleifer and Vishny (1994)
present a formal model to show that privatization enhances efficiency only if “control rights”
over employment decisions are shifted to the plant manager. Externally, Vickers and Yarrow
(1991) conclude that the attributes of the environment influence the efficiency gains from
privatization. Boardman and Vining (1989) argue that studying the effects of privatization is
relevant only for firms in competitive environments.

In this paper, we address two related questions. First, we examine what enterprise
reform really means in the Chinese context. In China, reform generally means installing
Western ownership and governance in existing state-owned or controlled enterprises. Have such
reforms affected performance for former SOEs? Or do former SOEs continue to behave as if
they were still state controlled? In other words, can the Chinese tiger (former SOE) change its
stripes? To address this question, we associate a variety of performance measures, such as
return on assets (ROA), total factor productivity (TFP) growth, and patent filings, with changes
in state equity shares and changes in state control. While a number of studies have compared
SOEs’ performance with private enterprises—and most tend to find that SOEs perform worse—
none of these papers explored whether former SOEs also performed worse (or as well as)
private enterprises.
Second, we ask whether the environment facing former SOEs has changed. To the
extent that current and former SOEs may be receiving extra support in the form of soft budget
constraints—manifested often through subsidies, tax holidays, and the provision of low-interest
loans—performance may be affected by a government that continues to support former SOEs in
ways that may help or hurt their performance.
Using a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enterprises in China between
1998 and 2013, we show that privatized SOEs continue to benefit from government support
relative to private enterprises. Compared to private firms that were never state-owned,
privatized SOEs are favored by industrial policies such as low interest loans and government
subsidies. These differences are more salient with the Chinese government’s trillion-dollar
stimulus package introduced after the 2008 global financial crisis.

3

We also examine post-privatization performance. Both SOEs and former (but now
private) SOEs significantly under-perform in profitability compared to private firms, suggesting
a misallocation of resources. Nevertheless, there are clear improvements in performance postprivatization, especially when the performance measure is productivity or patent filings. The
tiger can change its stripes; however, the government’s behavior in terms of ongoing loan
support is sticky.
Does this imply that Chinese SOEs can in fact be distinguished from private
enterprises? The reflexive answer, on several grounds, is affirmative. Chinese SOEs have legal
standing. Their ownership of many, although not all, state enterprises is transparent. Whether
the enterprise’s controlling shareholder, even if a minority shareholder, is state or non-state is
also known. Still, there are grounds for doubt. One concern is that the registration, ownership,
and nominal control of a firm may miss critical avenues of state influence, especially policies
advantageous to state-owned firms and extensions of Party influence into the private sector. A
further and more nuanced concern is the blurring of boundaries between the state and private
interests. 2
One clear implication of our research is the following: non-state firms that at any point
in their history were state-owned are very different from non-state firms with no past
experience of state ownership. These privatized enterprises, which we call “former SOEs",
enjoy lower interest rates, larger loan facilities, and more subsidies while suffering poorer

2

The blurring of boundaries involves simultaneous cooptation of private entrepreneurs by the state and
state capture by private interests, the former through membership in state-sponsored industry
associations and political bodies, the latter through corruption. Likely, both heavy-handed state
intrusion into the private sector and more subtle forms of cooptation and capture have taken place, the
consequence of which is that any simple state-private distinction based on registration, ownership, and
nominal control may be of limited value.

performance than never-SOEs. Importantly, this result holds for both private firms and firms
with legal-person ownership, which in the past has been treated as a stalking horse for state
ownership. These results suggest that there also exists a substantial gray zone between state
firms and private firms operating in the penumbra of the state. The challenge for researchers is
to locate these firms more precisely and understand their role in China’s rapid economic
development.
Our evidence raises serious questions about the efficacy of reform initiatives when
ownership changes but the environment does not. The evidence suggests that privatized SOEs
could perform better if the government would also change its behavior and limit low interest
loans which now favor both SOEs and former SOEs. Section II provides a brief literature
review, and how this paper fits into the literature. Section III presents the data, framework for
analysis and our hypotheses. Section IV presents results comparing policy treatment of SOEs,
former SOEs, and private enterprises. Section V measures the impact of ownership changes on
these three sets of enterprises, and Section VI concludes.

II. Literature Review
There is a large literature examining the relationship between state ownership and firm
performance. Andrei Shleifer, writing in 1998 at the start of China’s reform period, summarized
the literature on the effects of privatization in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. He
concluded that private ownership should generally be preferred to public ownership when the
incentives to innovate and to contain costs need to be strong, especially when competition
between suppliers, reputational mechanisms, and the possibility of provision by not-for-profit
firms is brought into play. In essence, this is the case for the "dynamic vitality" of free
enterprise. Shleifer also suggested that the pursuit by government officials of political goals
5

and personal income, as opposed to social welfare, further strengthens the case for private
ownership. Similarly, Ehrlich et al. (1994) and Karpoff (2001) argue that public-sector
ownership is always inferior to private sector ownership, because the principal (the
government) either cannot or does not choose to monitor the managers properly. This approach
focuses on ownership as the explanation for poor public-sector performance.
Consistent with the above arguments, most studies find that public-sector enterprises
perform poorly relative to their private-sector counterparts. This is true both for financial
performance and innovation. Boeing et al (2016) investigate the effect of different R&D
activities on TFP of publicly listed Chinese firms for the time period 2001–2011. They find
that privately-owned enterprises (POEs) benefit most from R&D investments. Furthermore,
only POEs benefit from sophisticated R&D efforts (i.e., highly cited patented research and
research in high-tech sectors). Wei et al (2017) find that although SOEs have received more
subsidies from the government, their performance in innovation is lackluster compared to
private enterprises. Furthermore, the elasticity of patent filings or patents granted with respect
to expenditures on R&D is significantly higher for private firms than for SOEs, which suggests
misallocations in public fiscal resources.
While the baseline comparison seems to be clear, other studies get mixed or ambiguous
results. A typical illustration is provided by DeWenter and Malatesta (2001), who compare the
500 largest firms globally in 1975, 1985, and 1995. They find that return on asset (ROA) and
return on equity (ROE) are significantly higher for private relative to public enterprises. In
addition, they find that both leverage and employment to sales ratios are higher for public
enterprises, consistent with the expectation that public enterprises have higher costs and lower
profits. They then look at a subsample of privatized firms, where they find inconsistent results:

6

performance increases post-privatization, while leverage and employment increase mainly preprivatization. Market returns from privatization are positive in Hungary, Poland, and the United
Kingdom but insignificant elsewhere.
One explanation for the conflicting evidence is that efficiency gains from privatization
depend on a variety of factors, including the degree of competition, the regulatory environment,
the magnitude of market failure, and the administrative capabilities of the government.
Peltzman (1971) questioned whether changing ownership alone can affect firm behavior. From
the perspective of internal factors, Shleifer and Vishny (1994) present a formal model to show
that privatization enhances efficiency only if “control rights” over employment decisions are
shifted to the plant manager. From the perspective of external factors, Vickers and Yarrow
(1991) conclude that the attributes of the environment influence the efficiency gains from
privatization.
Along those lines, Boardman and Vining (1989) argue that studying the effects of
privatization is relevant only for firms in competitive environments. In their review of the state
of the literature, Megginson and Netter (2001) conclude that more research is needed to “. . .
conclusively document whether reforms other than government divestiture can effectively serve
as a substitute (or precursor) for privatization.” Empirical studies have also shed light on the
importance of environmental contingencies. For example, Bartel and Harrison (2003) use a
1981–1995 panel of all public and private manufacturing establishments in Indonesia and
measure two important environmental factors: (1) soft budget constraints and (2) the degree of
internal and external competition. They show that both changes in ownership and changes in
the environment matter.

7

Most of the literature has focused on the question of whether SOEs perform worse in
terms of innovation in China, and most tend to find that the answer is yes. However, none of
these papers explored how former SOEs perform compared with private enterprises. The goal
of this paper is to examine the performance of the same firm, before and after privatization.
Doing so will allow us to tease out the effect of internal state ownership vs. external state
support in the performance differences between SOEs and private enterprises.

III. Data, Framework, and Hypotheses
We begin by describing the data sources and then turn to our framework and hypotheses.
Data sources
The main source of data comes from the Annual Industrial Survey (AIS) of the National Bureau
of Statistics of China. Our sample includes firm-level data of all medium and large enterprises
in manufacturing-related industries from 1998 to 2013. While concerns about the quality of AIS
have been raised (Brandt, Van Biesebroeck and Zhang, 2014), it remains to date the most
comprehensive firm-level data in China, with a survey of all enterprises with annual revenue
greater than 5 million RMB and greater than 20 million RMB beginning in 2011. 3 Notably,
although the AIS has been widely utilized in recent empirical studies on China (Aghion et al.,
2015; Berkowitz, Ma and Nishioka, 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Hsieh and Song, 2015; Song,
Storesletten and Zilibotti, 2011), we are one of the first to substantially extend the data series
after the 2008 global financial crisis. While this extension is not without the usual caveats
regarding data quality, we believe it is an important step towards understanding the Chinese
reform, especially intertwined with the crisis.

3

This threshold has been changed several times throughout the sample.
8

We supplement the AIS data with sector-year level price indices from the Dios database
to put all nominal values in constant 1998 values. 4
Typology of firms
A critical first step in understanding the efficacy of ownership reform is to understand the
ownership of firms before and after the reform. There has been disagreement in the definition of
different types of firms in the literature. We propose a typology of firms that sheds light on the
landscape of firm ownerships in China and provides a first step to understanding reforms.
We first group firms into two broad categories: state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and
privately-owned enterprises (POEs). There are three indicators in the AIS data that suggest the
ownership of a firm: state control, capital ownership shares, and registration types. State control
is a categorical variable indicating whether the firm’s controlling shareholder, not necessarily
the majority shareholder, is state-owned, collectively owned, or anything else. We follow
Hsieh and Song (2015) and define state control as a binary variable equal to one if the
controlling shareholder is the state. 5 Capital ownership shares include all six sources of capital
ownership amounts—state, collective, legal person, individual, foreign, and “Hong Kong,
Taiwan, and Macau”—which sum to the total paid-in capital of the firm. We define a firm’s
state capital share as its state capital amount as a percentage of the total paid-in capital. The
third indicator for firm ownership is its registration type with the government. As pointed out in
Hsieh and Song (2015), the use of registration types as a measure of firm ownership suffers

4

5

Throughout, sectors are defined at the two-digit sector code level, which yields 29 manufacturing
sectors.
The specific coding of the state control variable is as follows: 1 - state absolute control, 2 - state
relative control, 3 - collective absolute control, 4 - collective relative control, 5 - others. The rule of
defining state control changed in 2005: before 2005 (inclusive), control is defined to be by the state if
ownership is either state absolute control (1) or state relative control (2); after 2005: control is defined
to be by the state only if ownership is state absolute control (1).
9

from large inaccuracy and we also discard it. Following Hsieh and Song (2015), we define a
firm as state-owned if state control is equal to one or the state capital share exceeds 50 percent.
For robustness, Appendix tables repeat our analysis where SOE is defined as either state control
being equal to one or having any positive state capital shares. All other firms are treated as
privately owned. Among the private firms, we further differentiate firms with positive legal
person capital as legal person-owned (LPO) as it is difficult to pin down the ultimate ownership
of these capital. Table 1 summarizes the resulting distribution of firm ownership types. Note
that the number of LPO firms, by our definition, fluctuated over time and comprised nearly 35
percent of total firms in 2013.
SOE reforms
We now describe the privatization reform of SOEs in China during our sample period. Figure 1
tracks the government’s aggressive reform agenda since 1998 - while the majority of SOEs
exited, privatized SOEs in 2013 account for 15% of the number of firms in 1998. SOEs in 2013
only constitute 23% of the number of SOEs in 1998.

Figure 1: Number of SOEs and Privatized SOEs

10

Figure 2: Output Shares of SOEs, Former SOEs, and Always POEs

These SOEs and privatized SOEs constitute a large portion of the Chinese economy measured
by their total output value (Figure 2). Comparing the two panels, we can see that the average
size of privatized SOEs is smaller than the average of those who remained SOEs, reflecting the
“grasping the large, letting go of the small” policy.
Empirical Framework and Hypotheses
In our analysis, we will estimate if government policies and firm performance vary with
ownership differences. We will focus on the difference between SOEs, former SOEs, and always
POEs. We will also separately estimate the role of LPO enterprises for those that have always
had LPO status and those that shifted from SOE status to LPO status, due to early evidence
suggesting that state and LPO ownership are indistinguishable in terms of their impact on firm
performance (Wang, Xu, and Zhu, 2004). Consequently, we will separately measure the impact
of five ownership categories: always private, always SOE, always LPO, former SOE now private,
and former SOE now LPO. We do not include other categories, e.g., from private to SOE,
because they are negligible in our sample period.
11

To test the hypothesis that policies or performance are affected by ownership, we estimate
the following equation:
5

𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑎𝑎0 + � 𝑎𝑎𝑛𝑛 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑎𝑎6 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 + 𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
𝑛𝑛=1

Our primary outcome variables are a set of environment measures including interest subsidies
and loans, as well as output subsidies. Our performance measures include both financial as well
as economic measures of performance. These include ROA, TFP growth, and patent filings.
Controls Z include firm level controls as well as sector level 𝑗𝑗 controls such as the share of foreign
investment in the sector, export orientation of the sector, and tariffs. The firm fixed effect is
captured by fi , and Dt represents year dummies.
We test two main hypotheses regarding the impact of ownership in the Chinese context.
Our first hypothesis is regarding the impact of government support in the form of loans and
subsidies. This hypothesis explores the role of the environment and how it differs by ownership
categories:
Hypothesis 1a: Allocation of government support in the form of subsidies, tax breaks or low
interest loans favors both SOEs and former SOEs.
Hypothesis 1b: Allocation of government support in the form of subsidies, tax breaks or low
interest loans favors SOEs but not former SOEs
Our second hypothesis explores the impact of privatization—moving from public
ownership to private ownership—on performance:
Hypothesis 2a: Privatization is associated with better performance for the same firm.
Hypothesis 2b: Privatization leads former SOEs to behave like private enterprises.
12

Hypothesis 2c: Privatization leads former SOEs to improve performance, but they still perform
worse than their always privately-owned peers.
We test these two sets of hypotheses in the remainder of this paper. Section IV reports
our tests of Hypotheses 1a and 1b while Section V reports tests of Hypotheses 2a, 2b, and 2c.

IV. Government Policies vis-à-vis SOEs, privatized SOEs, and always POEs.
We compare government policies towards SOEs, privatized SOEs, and always POEs to test if
there exists any policy favoritism towards SOEs and if so, whether such favoritism persists after
privatization. These policies include financing policies (loan amounts and interest rates) and
government subsidies. We begin with visual images and then move to econometric evidence to
establish statistical significance and magnitudes. We also compare how these policy biases (if
they exist) responded in the 2008 global financial crisis, during which the Chinese government
issued a trillion-dollar stimulus package in the form of low-interest loans.
Interest rates on loans
Access to low-interest loans and other financing options are important for the growth of small
firms (Song, Storesletten and Zilibotti, 2011). Figure 3 gives a first look at the average interest
rates paid by different types of firms in China. Interest rates are defined as annual interest
payment divided by the firm’s current liabilities. Figure 3 makes it clear that even without
controlling for firm heterogeneity, (always) private firms pay much higher interest rates than
private firms that were formerly state-owned. Before the 2008 crisis, the difference was over
one percentage point (100 basis points) more in interest rates for private firms relative to former
SOEs. This difference not only persists over time but also widened after 2008 to two percentage
points (200 basis points). In contrast, the difference between SOEs and privatized SOEs is
13

somewhat smaller. Interest rates for privatized SOEs are still 100 basis points higher than those
paid by SOEs, but the difference did not change significantly over time. Note also that the
highest interest rates are paid by LPOs that were never SOEs.

Figure 3: Interest Rates: SOEs, Privatized SOEs, and Always POEs
Volume of Loans
We next compare the volume of loans by ownership category. Loan volumes are defined as
current liabilities divided by firm output. The story is similar to the interest rate trends, as
illustrated in Figure 4. Current SOEs have the highest ratio of liabilities to output, although the
ratio declined dramatically over the sample period. Private enterprises have historically had a
much lower loan ratio, and that ratio has declined only slightly. Former SOEs sit squarely
between the two extremes, with loan ratios above the private sector but below SOEs. One
interesting parallel with interest rates is the reversal in declining loan ratios with the financial
crisis. Both SOEs and former SOEs show a reversal, while the uptick in loan ratios for private

14

enterprises is much more muted. With respect to the volume of loans, POEs and LPOs, whether
or not former SOEs, are indistinguishable.

Figure 4: Volume of Loans: SOEs, Privatized SOEs, and Always POEs
Subsidies
We conclude this section with an examination of the allocation of subsidies. Figure 5 (left)
shows the fraction of different ownership classes receiving some subsidies from the state. The
results are again consistent with former SOEs occupying a grey area in between actual SOEs
and always POEs. POEs have the lowest percentage of firms receiving subsidies, with the
percentage climbing from above 5 percent in 1998 to over 15 percent in 2013. SOEs receive
the highest fraction of support, with the percentage rising from nearly 15 percent in 1998 to a
whopping 45 percent in 2013. Former SOEs are between these two extremes, with less than 15
percent receiving subsidies in 1998 and between 25 and 35 percent in 2013. Similar results
show in the amounts of subsidies received by firms with different ownership classes as well in
15

Figure 5 (right). With respect to subsidies in proportion to output, POEs and LPOs, whether or
not former SOEs, are again indistinguishable.

Figure 5: Subsidies: SOEs, Privatized SOEs, and Always POEs

Quantifying the differences
Tables 2 and 3 provide regression analysis that confirms the broad trends outlined in the
previous figures. In Table 2 we see that relative to SOEs, private firms, whether POEs or
LPOs, paid interest rates of up to 270 basis points higher (column 2, rows 3 and 4, Table 2) and
widened over time (column 4, rows 8 and 9, Table 2). However, former SOEs paid rates that
were only 70 basis points higher, indicating that they were significantly favored relative to the
private sector (column 2, rows 1 and 2, Table 2). While interest costs fell for all firms post16

crisis (column 6, row 5, Table 2), the discount was again much steeper for SOEs and former
SOEs than private enterprises (column 6, rows 13 and 14, Table 2). Columns 3, 5 and 7
compare interest rates across ownership types within firms (e.g., firms changing from private to
SOE to former SOE). Differences in interest rates are smaller (26 basis points) but significant
and driven primarily by post-crisis differential treatment (column 7, rows 11-14, Table 2).
Table 3 presents results where the dependent variable is not implicit interest rates paid
but loan quantities allocated to enterprises. As in Figure 4, loans are defined as current
liabilities divided by the value of output. The second column of Table 3 indicates that private
enterprises received 72 (LPOs) to 74 (POEs) percent less loans (as a share of output) than
SOEs. Privatized SOEs fared slightly better, receiving 45 percent less loans than SOEs. Over
time, however, the spread between loan allocations to SOEs and other establishments has
narrowed, as reflected in the positive differential trend in loans for LPOs and POEs in column
4. Over the entire period, the gap in loans between SOEs and private enterprises declined over
time by 5 percent annually. Both privatized SOEs and always private enterprises received more
loans to catch up with SOEs post-crisis. Controlling for firm fixed effects again shows more
muted relationships: SOEs received slightly more loans than private enterprises and former
SOEs, and the gap narrowed post-crisis.
Table 4 shows differences in the amounts of subsidies received across ownership types.
On average, private enterprises received 5500 RMB less than SOEs in subsidies for each
million RMB in the value of their output annually, whereas former SOEs received 3600 RMB
less than SOEs (column 2, rows 1-4, Table 4). This gap narrows between SOEs and former
SOEs but further widens for private enterprises during the sample period (column 4, rows 6-9,
Table 4). Post crisis, SOEs and former SOEs received similarly more subsidies, while private

17

enterprises received much less to no additional subsidies than before (column 6, rows 10-14,
Table 4). These results persist after controlling for firm fixed effects although magnitudes are
smaller.
To summarize, the evidence suggests that current SOEs were heavily favored over the
sample period in terms of interest rate terms, loan amounts, and subsidies. POEs and LPOs that
were formerly SOEs fell in between the two groups, with more favorable treatment than
establishments that were always private but less favorable treatment than current SOEs. We
now shift from government treatment to evaluating performance differentials.

V. Performance Comparisons: ROA, TFP, and Patent Filings.
Return on Assets
Figure 6 shows ROA for our five categories of enterprises, where ROA is defined as total
profits divided by total assets.

Figure 6: ROA: SOEs, Privatized SOEs, and Always POEs
18

At the beginning of the sample period, SOEs had on average a negative ROA but it
quickly shifted to positive after two years. All groups of enterprises have experienced rising
ROAs, but both the levels and the growth rates have been higher for private enterprises.
Beginning in 2004, ROAs in the private sector increased even more rapidly, leading the already
sizable gap of nearly 10 percentage points to increase even more. Former SOEs were again in
between the two extremes, exhibiting slightly higher returns than SOEs but significantly lower
than purely private enterprises. The ROAs of POEs and LPOs, whether or not former SOEs, are
indistinguishable.
Table 5 presents econometric evidence confirming the observations in Figure 6 and
decomposing the differences in profitability into contributions of government treatment and
ownership types. The bottom of Table 5 shows a complex relationship between soft budget
constraints and firm profitability. Profitability declines with loan amounts and increases with
direct subsidies, neither surprising. However, and nearly unique to China, higher interest rates
are associated with higher profitability, likely due to the disproportionate flow of near
benchmark-rate commercial bank loans to low-performing SOEs. 6 After controlling for the
differential government treatment, private enterprises still exhibited ROAs that were 3
percentage points higher than SOEs, whereas former SOEs showed slightly lower ROAs
(column 2, rows 1-4, Table 5). Post crisis, profitability increased more for private enterprises

6

While we have no data on the identity of lenders, the following from Hachem (2018: 302) is apt:
“State-owned firms in China can borrow at rates much closer to the benchmark because of government
support, so it stands to reason that trust companies are lending [at approximately 2.5 percentage points
above benchmark rates] to private firms that are still financially repressed and/or local governments
that may not be very sensitive to interest rates. Trusts also have to reach for higher yields because the
WMPs to which they are linked exceed the deposit rate ceiling, a spread that reflects the shadow cost
of the liquidity regulation to the sponsoring bank.”
19

than former SOEs, who also became increasingly more profitable than SOEs (column 6, rows
10-14, Table 5). Similar results remain after controlling for firm fixed effects.
Productivity Comparisons
In the remainder of the paper, we focus on two other measures of performance, using either
productivity growth or patent filings. Unfortunately, the Chinese Census Bureau stopped
making intermediate input purchases available after 2007, so we are not able to calculate TFP
after 2007. All our research on productivity growth presented in this paper consequently only
covers the period 1998 through 2007. For discussions regarding how TFP is calculated, the
reader is referred to Aghion et al (2015), or Du, Jefferson and Harrison (2014). We employ two
approaches to measure TFP growth. The first approach estimates a production function with
firm fixed effects and then calculates the productivity residual after subtracting share weighted
inputs from total output. The second approach, taken from Olley and Pakes (1996), employs a
similar approach but adjusts for complications such as the endogeneity of input choice. The
results are consistent across the different methodologies for calculating TFP.
Table 6 begins with the full unbalanced panel. We separate ownership into two effects,
“stateshare,” which varies between 0 and 100 and indicates the percentage of equity owned by
the state, and “statecontrol,” which is the dummy variable coded 1 for state control. We also
control for a number of other factors that affect productivity, such as tariff rates in inputs,
outputs, and downstream sectors, foreign investment in the sector, export orientation of the
sector, and whether the establishment receives interest subsidies (“index_interest”), tax breaks
(“index_tax”), or subsidies (“index_subsidy”). We also include both establishment fixed
effects and year effects in all specifications, so we are effectively measuring what drives
productivity growth, not productivity levels.

20

In Table 6, we see that the coefficients on both stateshare and statecontrol are
significant and negative. This indicates that moving to private ownership either through equity
holdings or releasing state control raises productivity growth at the enterprise level. For
stateshare, the coefficient of -0.0147 in the first column indicates that productivity growth
increases by 1.47 percent when stateshare moves from 100 to 0. The coefficient on
statecontrol is slightly higher, indicating that productivity growth would rise by nearly 2
percentage points if control were to shift to the private sector.
Tables 7 and 8 repeat the same exercise but only retain establishments that were present
across all years. There are very few enterprises that were present across all years, leading to a
90% drop in sample size. When we restrict the sample to only these enterprises, neither
stateshare nor statecontrol are generally significant. The only exception is when we restrict the
sample to only exporting enterprises, defined as those with some share of output exported
abroad. In that case, the coefficient on statecontrol, but not stateshare, is significant and
negative. In Table 8 we keep the same sample but interact statecontrol and stateshare. In this
specification, the interaction is significant and negative. We hypothesize that the coefficient is
not significant in Table 7 due to a high degree of multicollinearity in the balanced panel
between ownership and equity participation.
Impact of former SOE status
Table 9 explores the impact of being a former SOE on both productivity and resource
allocations using the shorter 1998-2007 sample. The results in columns (1) and (2) measure the
impact of having been an SOE on productivity growth. The coefficient on former SOE is not
statistically significant, indicating that POEs that were once SOEs grow neither more nor less
quickly than their private counterparts. The tiger can change his stripes, particularly when it

21

comes to the impact of ownership on productivity growth. State share and state ownership are
both associated with poorer productivity growth, as reported in Tables 7 and 8.
The last four columns of Table 9 are robustness checks on our earlier estimates testing
for the impact of ownership on allocation of tax breaks, subsidies, and low-interest loans. The
results indicate that former SOEs are significantly more likely to benefit from low-interest loans
relative to their private sector counterparts.
Patent Filings
Finally, we turn to patent activities during a shorter sample of 1998-2009, where we obtain
firms’ patent filings data from He, Tong, Zhang, and He (2016). During this time, innovation
activities have significantly increased in China both in the number of firms filing at least one
patent annually and the number of patents filed per firm. We explore differences in patent
filings across ownership types.
Table 10 illustrates our findings in total patent filings (including utility, invention and
design patents). Columns 1-4 compare the number of firms that file at least one patent in a year
across ownership types, weighted by firm sizes (total assets). On average, private enterprises
are 30 percent more likely to file a patent in a year than SOEs per each million RMB in total
assets (average total assets are about 0.1 million RMB), whereas former SOEs are 23 to 26
percent more likely than SOEs to file a patent (column 1, rows 1-4, Table 10). Results are
similar for the number of patents shown in columns 5-8: Private enterprises filed 0.5 to 0.8
more patents a year than SOEs and former SOEs per each million RMB in total assets (column
5, rows 1-4, Table 10). The gaps between private enterprises and SOEs (as well as former
SOEs) in both likelihood of patenting and patenting intensity have narrowed over time. Results
are similar after controlling for firm fixed effects though less precisely estimated.

22

Closing the Soft Budget Constraints Gap
Our evidence in Tables 9 and 10 demonstrates that both ownership and the environment facing
former SOEs—namely the provision of soft budget constraints—affect firms’ performance in
ROA and patent filings. Furthermore, the previous section suggests that former SOEs still
receive extra support in the form of these soft budget constraints when compared to always
POEs, and thus can further benefit from closing the gap in the environment they face.
We decompose the effect of ownership changes and potential gains from further closing
the soft budget constraints gap. First, note that changing ownership status from SOE to former
SOE has a direct effect on performance as well as an indirect effect through the interest rates,
loan size, and subsidy amount that the firm receives. Consider, for example, LPOs that were
formerly SOEs. Using the specification with year and sector fixed effects (column 2, Tables 25), LPO privatization leads to slightly lower ROA of -0.35 percentage points but higher ROA of
69.1/10000*44.621=0.308 percentage points (through interest rate), (-44.494)/100*(4.285)=1.907 percentage points (though loan size), and (-3546.9)/1000000*2.857=-0.01
percentage points (through subsidy amount)—a total of 1.855 percentage points. Further
closing the soft budget constraints gap for the LPOs that were formerly SOEs would increase its
ROA by (271.17-69.1)/10000*44.621=0.902 percentage points (through interest rate), -(72.39244.494)/100*(-4.285)=1.195 percentage points (through loan size), and -(5363.93546.9)/1000000*2.857=-0.005 percentage points (through subsidy amount)—a total of 2.092
percentage points. The results for POE privatization parallel those for LPOs. Table 11 in the
Appendix presents decompositions of the potential gains from privatization on ROA and patent
filings for LPOs and POEs separately—note that median total assets is about RMB 100 million.
These results suggest that closing the soft budget constraints gap for former SOEs can achieve a

23

substantial gain (an additional 104%-113%) in ROA and a modest gain (an additional 8.6%9.6%) in patent likelihood. The results on ROA, in particular, suggest that the full benefits of
privatization of former SOEs have yet to be achieved.
VI. CONCLUSION
Privatization has been a crucial part of economic form in China. However, we have limited
understanding how privatization change the performance of privatized companies, as
privatization changes two conditions at the same time. On the one hand, ownership change may
lead to stronger incentives for innovation and budget control. On the other hand, the privatized
firm may lose the privileged treatment it once enjoys. So net outcomes are not clear. Using a
comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enterprises in China between 1998 and 2013,
spanning the stimulus package following the 2008 financial crisis, we show that privatized
SOEs continue to benefit from government support relative to private enterprises, receiving low
interest loans and government subsidies, especially after 2008. Moreover, both SOEs and
privatized SOEs significantly under-perform in profitability compared to private firms, despite
some improvements in performance post-privatization. We also found, contrary to earlier
research, that firms with legal-person shareholders behave like other private firms—LPOs are
not stalking horses for SOEs. In sum, the tiger can change his stripes—performance outcomes
improve post-privatization. However, the government’s behavior seems to be quite sticky—
former SOEs retain ready access to large loans, concessionary interest rates, and outright
subsidies.
