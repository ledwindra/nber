    "abstract": "\n\nWe design a field experiment to study how the allocation of authority between frontline procurement officers and their monitors affects performance both directly and through the response to incentives. In collaboration with the government of Punjab, Pakistan, we shift authority from monitors to procurement officers and introduce financial incentives in a sample of 600 procurement officers in 26 districts. We find that autonomy alone reduces prices by 9% without reducing quality and that the effect is stronger when the monitor tends to delay approvals for purchases until the end of the fiscal year. In contrast, the effect of performance pay is muted, except when agents face a monitor who does not delay approvals. Time use data reveal agents\u2019 responses vary along the same margin: autonomy increases the time devoted to procurement and this leads to lower prices only when monitors cause delays. By contrast, incentives work when monitors do not cause delays. The results illustrate that organizational design and anti-corruption policies must balance agency issues at different levels of the hierarchy.\n\n",

The online web portal used for this project, called Punjab Online Procurement System or POPS, had earlier received some funding from the World Bank Pakistan office.\n\u2022\tFieldwork for this project in Pakistan was managed by the Center for Economic Research, Pakistan (CERP).\n\u2022\tThis project received the in-kind support of the Government of Punjab, Pakistan, which provided access to administrative tax data for the project and which implemented the transfers described in this paper.\n\u2022\tI used to work for the Government of Punjab and Pakistan from November 1992 to August 2005. Other than salaries for my period of work from 1992 to 2005, I have received no financial payments from the Government of Punjab.\n\u2022\tI currently work for the London School of Economics as a Professor in Practice. In the past I have worked with the International Growth Centre at LSE that was funded by DFID.\n\u2022\tI am a director of Center for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP) which implemented the project in Pakistan. CERP is non-profit research center and has no stake in the outcomes of any given evaluation results. My position at CERP is not paid.\n\u2022\tNeither the funders nor the Government of Punjab had right of prior review over this study.\n\n\n"
