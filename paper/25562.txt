Immigration and Preferences for Redistribution in Europe
Alberto Alesina, Elie Murard, and Hillel Rapoport
NBER Working Paper No. 25562
February 2019
JEL No. D6,O15,P16
ABSTRACT
We examine the relationship between immigration and attitudes toward redistribution using a
newly assembled data set of immigrant stocks for 140 regions of 16 Western European countries.
Exploiting within-country variations in the share of immigrants at the regional level, we find that
native respondents display lower support for redistribution when the share of immigrants in their
residence region is higher. This negative association is driven by regions of countries with
relatively large Welfare States and by respondents at the center or at the right of the political
spectrum. The effects are also stronger when immigrants originate from Middle-Eastern
countries, are less skilled than natives, and experience more residential segregation. These results
are unlikely to be driven by immigrants' endogenous location choices.

Introduction

Private and public generosity (charity and welfare) travel more easily within the same ethnic
lines, nationality and religious affiliation.1 Alesina and Glaeser (2004) argue that one of the
reasons why the welfare state is more generous and expensive in Western Europe than in
the US is that European countries have been traditionally much more homogeneous than
the US, a country built by waves of relatively recent immigrants. However in the last two
decades immigration in Western Europe has substantially increased and has become (and
will remain for the foreseeable future) a major political issue. The question, then, is: does
immigration reduce support for redistributive policies in Europe? The answer provided by
this paper is ”yes”, but with important qualifications.
To answer the question, we assemble a unique data set of fully harmonized population
census/register data at the regional level for 140 regions in 16 different European countries
(in the years 2000 and 2010), which is then matched with attitudinal data from the biannual
2002-2016 rounds of the European Social Survey. We investigate the relationship between
immigration and natives’ attitudes to redistribution by exploiting within-country (i.e., regional) variation in the share of immigrants, thus holding constant Welfare policies at the
national level. Our paper combines a large geographical coverage (sixteen different European
countries) with (i) immigration data at the regional level, and (ii) an empirical methodology
based on a rich set of fixed effects, which allows for addressing some of the endogeneity problems (e.g., welfare magnets) that have plagued previous multi-country descriptive studies.
We cannot hold constant welfare policies that vary at the local level, an issue which may
be of limited importance in some countries (e.g., France) but are more relevant in others
(e.g., Sweden or Germany). In any event, we analyze the robustness of our results to various potential confounders such as the non-random location choices of immigrants (or to the
residential sorting of natives). The results are also robust to excluding Federal States where
welfare policies are largely set at the regional level, suggesting that they are not driven by
welfare magnet effects.
We first find that local (i.e., regional) exposure to immigrants in the residence region affects natives’ perception of the number of immigrants at the national level and, therefore, also

See Alesina and Giuliano (2011) and Stichnoth and Van der Straeten (2013) for a survey on the literature

on redistributive policies, and Alesina and La Ferrara (2005) for a survey on the effect of social heterogeneity
on social capital and trust; see also Algan et al. (2016) for recent results.

their perception about the identity (natives versus immigrants) of the potential beneficiaries
of the Welfare State. We then uncover that native respondents in our sample display lower
support for redistribution when the share of immigrants in their residence region is higher.
This attitudinal effect is sizeable in reltative terms, in comparison to the effect of individual
variables such as education or income that are important determinants of preferences for
redistribution (Alesina and Giuliano, 2011). For example, the anti-redistribution effect of a
one-quintile increase in the immigrants’ share is about half as large as the attudinal impact
of a one-quintile increase in household income.2
This average effect hides considerable heterogeneity along a number of dimensions: types
of receiving countries, natives’ individual characteristics, and immigrant types. The most
important dimension of the individual heterogeneity we uncover is political affiliation. The
anti-redistribution impact of immigration is almost entirely driven by individuals placing
themselves at the center or the right of the political spectrum, while the attitudes of leftist
individuals are barely affected. We also find that the reaction against redistribution is significantly stronger among natives who hold negative views about immigrants or think that
immigrants should not be entitled to welfare benefits. We address the issue of the endogeneity of political affiliations to immigration by showing that it is statistically small and
by applying a bounds analysis to demonstrate that it is unlikely to affect our coefficient
estimates. Secondly, the attitudinal effect of immigration greatly depends on immigrants’
countries of origin and skills. Immigrants originating from the Middle-East (North-Africa
included) generate a larger anti-redistribution effect (about three times more negative) relative to other types of immigrants. We also uncover that immigrants’ skills, both in terms of
formal education and labor market occupation, shape natives’ attitudinal reaction: a higher
proportion of more skilled immigrants (relative to natives) tends to significantly mitigate the
anti-redistribution effect of immigration. Thirdly, the negative association between immigration and support for redistribution is significantly stronger in destination countries with
more generous Welfare States (e.g., Nordic countries and France) relative to countries with
smaller Welfare States (e.g., the UK or Ireland).
The attitudinal response to immigration is also more pronounced among less educated
2

More specifically, a one standard-deviation increase in the log share of immigrants reduces natives’

support for redistribution by 6.2% of the standard-deviation of attitudes. We cannot compare this effect
with the impact of a one standard deviations increase in household income because the income variable is
not continuous (but, rather, categorical) in the ESS data.

individuals and among members of the middle and upper class. Furthermore, natives’ reaction against redistribution appears to be driven by both the recent cohorts of immigrants
arrived in the last decade (2000-2010) and by earlier cohorts arrived before 1990. Finally,
we uncover that, for a given share of immigrants in a region, a higher residential segregation of immigrants is significantly associated with a further reduction in the support for
redistribution.
Our paper relates to the literature on population diversity and demand for redistribution.
Beliefs about who is a worthy recipient of public generosity correlate with race, especially
in the United States. Many studies find that the white American majority is much less
supportive of redistribution than members of minority groups (holding income constant) –
see Alesina and La Ferrara (2005) for a survey. Using individual data for the U.S., Luttmer
(2001) shows evidence for “group loyalty effects”, namely that support for redistribution increases if members of the respondent’s own ethnic group are over-represented among welfare
recipients. Using experimental data, Fong and Luttmer (2009) study the role of racial group
loyalty on generosity, measured by charitable giving in a dictator game (where respondents
choose how to divide $100 between between themselves and a charity dedicated to Hurricane Katrina victims), and find that racial discrimination in giving importantly depends on
subjective racial identification (how close one feels to one’s own racial group). With more
specific reference to immigration, Tabellini (2018) looks at the Great Migration in the US
in the first part of the last century and shows results consistent with those of the present
paper, namely that natives became less favorable to social policies in cities which received
more immigrants (and more so when immigrants were culturally or religiously further away
from the natives). These effects hold despite the economic benefits brought about by the
immigrants.
Turning more specifically to Europe, Dahlberg et al. (2012) analyze changes in natives’
attitudes to redistribution resulting from the arrival of refugees in Sweden in the late 1980s
and early 1990s and find a strong negative effect, especially among high-income earners.
They take advantage of the existence between 1985 and 1994 of a “refugee placement program” which allocates refugees to municipalities in Sweden, essentially without refugees
having a say as to where they can be placed; hence, they thereby solve the problem of
endogenous immigrants’ location choice. Indeed, one difficulty when analyzing the consequences of immigration on welfare policies is that immigrants (especially the poorest) may

4

be attracted to so called ”welfare magnets”. Boeri (2010) and Borjas (1999) find evidence
of such welfare magnet effects respectively in the context of the US and in the context of
Western Europe (see also Razin and Wahba, 2015). How this effect may bias the results
for attitudes to redistribution is not obvious: immigrants may indeed flow to countries or
regions with more generous welfare systems, however these are precisely the countries in
which individuals tend to be more favorable towards redistribution, so that the direction of
the bias is unclear. This is addressed in our analysis, at least partly, by focusing on withincountry (i.e., regional) variation in immigrants’ shares. Senik et al. (2009) use the European
Social Survey to analyze the role of individual characteristics (especially attitudes toward
immigration) in determining attitudes to redistribution in response to increased perceived
immigration. There is also a large, mostly descriptive political science literature (see, e.g.,
Burgoon et al., 2012; Burgoon, 2014) that stresses the role of occupational exposure to immigration and of immigrants’ integration, respectively. Finally, Alesina et al. (2018) perform
an original survey on six countries (the US and five major Western European countries: the
UK, Sweden, Germany, Italy and France) and show two sets of results. First, natives are
vastly misinformed about immigrants, regarding their number, country of origin, education
level and reliance on the welfare state. Second, there is a strong correlation between natives’
beliefs about immigrants and their preferences for redistribution. They also find, as we do,
that this relationship is stronger for self-reported right-wing respondents.
This paper is organized as follows. The next section describes in detail the novel data set
we assemble. Section 3 presents our empirical strategy. Section 4 describes our main results,
robustness checks, and the heterogeneity analysis. The last section concludes.

Data

We construct a novel data set on the stocks of immigrants at the regional level for a total
of 140 regions in 16 Western European countries. While there have been several efforts to
compile global bilateral immigrant stocks across countries (e.g. Docquier et al., 2009; Özden
et al., 2011), we provide a new data set of immigrant population by origin country and by
educational level in each region (NUTS) of Europe by harmonizing population censuses and
registers in the years 1991, 2001 and 2011. We then combine this data set with individual
attitudinal data drawn from the European Social Survey across more than 140 regions in

5

western Europe.

2.1

Stock of immigrants at the regional level

2.1.1

Primary sources of data

We draw on population census and register data, from the 1991, 2001 and 2011 rounds – see
Table A.11 in the appendix. Census data were used for 10 countries: Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, France, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. These
data were either provided by the national statistical offices or taken from IPUMS International.3 For countries not taking periodic censuses but keeping population registers, we
extracted data from those registers.4 In order to obtain immigrants stock data by educational
level, we sometime rely on the European Labor Force Survey (due to the lack of suitable
census data) – see Table A.12 in the appendix.5
We compile the immigrant stock data in the regions of residence of the 16 European
countries we cover by using the NUTS geocode standard for referencing the subdivisions of
countries. The NUTS standard defines minimum and maximum population thresholds for
the size of the NUTS regions: between 3 and 7 millions for NUTS1 units, between 800,000
and 2 millions for NUTS2 units, and between 150,000 and 800,000 for NUTS3 units. NUTS
regions are generally based on existing national administrative subdivisions.6
Definition of migrants Official records usually apply two different definitions as to what
constitutes a migrant: either being born in a foreign country, or being a citizen of a foreign
country. When harmonizing the data, we gave priority to the definition based on country
of birth. Birthplace data is available from most of the primary sources, expect for the
3

For the UK, the census data we used (as provided by the ONS) does not cover Scotland nor Northern

Ireland. Those two countries run separately their own census which we could not have access to.
4
This is the case for 6 countries: Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden.
5
We use the European Labor Force Survey (ELFS) instead of population censuses in three countries:
Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. In Belgium and Switzerland, we chose not to rely on census data
because of the high share of foreign-born with unknown level of education. In Germany, the census does not
report the birthplace, only the Labor Force Survey does.
6
For example in mainland France, NUTS1 mirrors the 9 French areas ”Zones d’etudes et d’amenagement
du territoire ” while the NUTS2 corresponds to the 22 French ”Regions” and NUTS3 to the 96 French
”Departements”.

6

1991 rounds of the Austrian and Greek censuses, as well as for the 1991 and 2001 rounds
of the German registers. In order to have a consistent definition of immigrants over time
that is comparable across countries, we had to impute the number of foreign-born in the
few instances in which data are missing. We follow the approach of Brücker et al. (2013)
by using the ratio between foreign citizens and foreign-born in year t in order to infer the
number of foreign born in the previous years t − 10 or t − 20.

7

Countries of origin Following the end of the cold war, many countries redrew their
political boundaries. The coding of birthplace data, which varies from one population census
to another, often only reports the original territory as it existed before the split into newly
constituted countries. For example, in many censuses of the 16 European countries, Serbia,
Croatia or Bosnia are aggregated under the name of the former Yugoslavia. We treated
as a single entity the countries that belonged to each of the following territory: the former
Yugoslavia, the former Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands Antilles, the Channel Islands, Sudan
and South Sudan, Indonesia and East Timor. With respect to the ex-USSR, we choose to
impute (when not known) the number of immigrants originating from the individual countries
that comprise that area as follows: observing the total number of migrants from USSR in a
given destination region, we allocated these migrants to each individual countries by using
the IAB brain-drain database Brücker et al. (2013) which provides, at the national level,
7

br,o,t of foreign-born from origin country o living in region r at time
In practice we impute the number N

t by using the observed number of foreign citizen Cr,o,t in the same year, region and coming from the same
origin country:
br,o,t = ro,t+10 ∗ Cr,o,t
N
with ro,t+10 =

No,t+10
Co,t+10

the ratio at time t + 10 between national-level number of foreign-born and foreign-

citizen from origin o and living in the same destination country of region r. For Austria and Greece, we
impute the number of foreign-born in 1991 by using the ratio between foreign-born and foreign-citizen in 2001.
For Germany, we impute the number of foreign-born in 1991 and 2001 by using the ratio in 2011. In order
to assess the precision of such imputation, we predicted the number of foreign-born in Austria and Greece
in 2000 following the same approach (i.e., using the 2011 ratio between foreign-born and foreign-citizen) and
compared the imputed 2000 values and the observed 2000 values of foreign-born by origin country and region
of residence. In both Austria and Greece, we obtained a coefficient of correlation above 0.97 between the
observed and the imputed values. For Germany, we checked how the 2000 imputed values by origin countries
correlate with the DIOC data 2000 values at the national level (Docquier and Marfouk, 2006). Considering
only origin countries with positive DIOC numbers of migrants, we obtained a coefficient of correlation above
0.96 – and in particular a similar number of migrants from the ex-USSR, the so-called ethnic Germans.

7

the number of immigrants by individual origin.8 After harmonization, we have 217 different
countries of origin in 1991, 2001 and 2011. The share of the population for whom the place
of birth is missing or too imprecise is below 1% for most receiving countries and not higher
than 4% for two countries (the UK and Switzerland).
Education data

We distinguish three levels of education using the International Stan-

dard Classification of Education: primary (ISCED 0/1/2, i.e. lower secondary, primary and
no schooling); secondary (ISCED 3/4 : high-school leaving certificate or equivalent) and
tertiary education (ISCED 5A/5B/6 or higher).
2.1.2

Other sources of data at the regional level

Occupation data We use the 2011 Census database of Eurostat that harmonises statistical definitions and classifications in order to ensure the comparability of population census
data across different countries. This database gives information on the 2011 population structure at the NUTS regional level. In particular, we use data on the number of foreign-born
and native workers in various occupations, categorized by the ISCO 1-digit classification.
This occupational data is available for every country used in the analysis expect for Austria,
Belgium and France.9
Segregation data We also draw on a dataset providing the distribution of the immigrant
population at a very high spatial resolution in order to measure the residential segregation
of immigrants within NUTS regions of Europe. This dataset has been assembled by the
Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission that harmonized 2011 population
censuses in 8 different countries: France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal,
Spain and UK. The ensuing data is a uniform grid giving the numbers of immigrants in cells
of 100 by 100 meters in each of these 8 European countries. The primary source of data is the
population at the census tract level. However, the geographical resolution and geometries
8

For example, for a given year and destination region, we impute the number of Ukrainian migrants by

multiplying the number of migrants from the USSR in the same year and destination region with the share
of Ukrainians among all USSR migrants in the same year and destination country, as provided by the IAB
dataset.

of census sampling units are extremely variable across European countries. In the case of
the Netherlands, sampling areas are at the postal code level (groups of buildings including
around 25 households). Other countries report data at higher resolution (from 0.01 to 1.7
square km) using census sampling areas with a regular grid (Germany) or polygons with
variable shapes and sizes. These differences in geometries and resolution were harmonized
through the dasymmetric mapping method.10 We aggregate this data at the regional level
by constructing an index of immigrants’ spatial segregation within each NUTS region. We
will explain the construction of this index in the results section 4.3.4.

2.2

Individual attitudinal data

Data on individual attitudes towards redistribution are from the European Social Survey
(ESS), which contains information on a wide range of socioeconomic and political values for
individuals in 28 European countries. The data are available for seven biannual survey waves
starting in 2002 and have been widely used.11 We measure preferences towards redistribution
by relying on answers to the statement “The government should take measures to reduce
differences in income levels ”. We use a 5-point scale variable V1 that measures the extent
to which the respondent agrees with the previous statement: agrees strongly (5), agrees (4),
neither agrees nor disagrees (3), disagrees (2), disagrees strongly (1).
We also use the 2008 and 2016 rounds of the ESS that include a rich set of specific
questions on attitudes towards Welfare. In particular, respondents are asked to what extent
they agree that “For a society to be fair, differences in people’s standard of living should
be small ” (V2 ). Respondents also report how much responsibility they think governments
should have to ensure a reasonable standard of living for the old (V3 ), the unemployed (V4 ), as
well as to ensure sufficient child care services for working parents (V5 ). Finally, respondents
report their views on social benefits, and in particular the extent to which they agree with
10

This method me redistributes the population (by origin country) from the original census areas to

a regular grid at 100 m resolution. The method allocates higher shares of the total population to cells
characterized by a higher surface occupied by buildings and with an urban land cover classification, as
compared to cells occupied, for example, by green areas or with an agricultural land.For details, see
https://bluehub.jrc.ec.europa.eu/datachallenge/data
11
For preferences towards redistribution see Burgoon et al. (2012); Finseraas (2008); Luttmer and Singhal
(2011); Senik et al. (2009). For views about immigration see Card et al. (2005) and Ortega and Polavieja
(2012).

9

the following three statements: “social benefits place too great strain on economy ” (V6 ),
“social benefits cost businesses too much in taxes and charges ” (V7 ), “social benefits make
people lazy ” (V8 ).
Table 1 shows that, somewhat surprisingly, these eight different variables are not as
strongly correlated as one may expect, with coefficients of correlation below 0.5 (variables
have been recoded in such a way that a higher value corresponds to stronger support for Welfare and redistribution). We construct a composite index of attitudes as the first component
of a Principal Component Analysis of these eight variables.12
In the analysis of the effect of immigration on attitudes towards redistribution, we use
both this overall index of Welfare attitudes and the support for reduction in income differences (V1 ) as dependent variables. The advantage of the index is to combine the diverse
facets of Welfare attitudes into one single indicator instead of relying on only one dimension.
The advantage of the attitudinal outcome V1 is to be available for every round of the ESS
while the index can only be constructed in the 2008 and 2016 rounds. Finally, we standardize these two dependent variables (Z-score formula) in order to make the results more
comparable (i.e., variables are rescaled to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1).

Matched data on attitudes and immigrant stocks

The ESS provides relatively precise information on the place of residence of the respondents:
at the regional NUTS2 level for most countries expect for Belgium, France, Germany and the
UK for which only larger NUTS 1 regions are available. In Ireland, smaller NUTS 3 region
are available. In few instances the coding of the place of residence in the ESS data does

The weights obtained by the PCA are very similar for each of the height different variables

10

not fully coincide with the NUTS classification or is sometimes inconsistent across different
survey rounds. To address this issue, in some instances we aggregate different NUTS regions
into one larger unit.13 Moreover, three NUTS regions are not covered by the ESS survey,
and four regions are extremely poorly covered, and were therefore excluded them from the
analysis.14
Once these small adjustments are made, we can combine the ESS attitudinal survey
with the immigrant stock data across 148 different regions of residence – either NUTS2 or
NUTS1 – in the 16 European countries we cover over the period 2002-2016. Table A.13 in
the Appendix provides the exhaustive list of the regions included in the analysis. We match
each ESS round in a given decade to the immigrant stock data at the beginning of the same
decade. We thus merge all biannual ESS rounds from 2002 to 2008 with the 2000 immigrant
stocks, and all biannual ESS rounds from 2010 to 2016 with the 2010 immigrant stocks.

2.3.1

Sample

Since we are interested in the effect of immigration on natives’ support for redistribution,
we restrict the ESS sample to native-born individuals, i.e. born in their current European
country of residence. We consider only respondents with both non-missing data on attitudes
towards redistribution (variable V1 ) and non-missing data on individual characteristics. Pooling all biannual ESS rounds from 2002 to 2016, we obtain a repeated cross-section of 134,033
individuals without missing information.

15

In the estimation sample there are on average

905 individual observations by region, with a minimum of 33 in the Italian region of Liguria
(ITC3) and a maximum of 6200 in the Belgium Flemish region (BE2). When using the
composite index of Welfare attitudes, we obtain an estimation sample of 31,223 individual
13

The northwestern region of Switzerland with Zurich (CH03-CH04), the Southern part of Finland with

Helsinki (FI1B-FI1C), and the Trentino province with the Bolzano province in Italy (ITH1-ITH2)
14
This is the case of the regions of Ceuta and Melilla in Spain (with only 30 and 15 respondents in
the entire 2002-2016 period), the Acores and Madeira in Portugal (not covered), Aland in Finland (with
44 respondents), Molise (not covered) and the Valle d’Aosta (with 38 respondents) in Italy. In the other
regions, the number of respondents is typically around 1500, and always greater than 100.
15
This sample represents 66% of the initial sample because it keeps observations where all control variables are jointly non-missing. We checked that this restricted sample does not differ substantially from the
initial sample in terms of attitudes, political preferences and socio-demographics: We obtain standardized
differences (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985) always lower than 7%, which indicates that there are no important
imbalances between the two sample.

Descriptive Statistics

Immigrants in Europe Over the last decades, immigration has increased in every European country, and has dramatically accelerated since the early 2000s, particularly in Spain,
Italy and Ireland (see Figure A.1 in the Appendix). This increase is due to a inflow of immigrants coming from countries outside of the EU15, and mainly from Central and Eastern
Europe, the Middle East, and South America (see Figure A.2 in the Appendix). As shown
by Figure 1, the population share of immigrants in 2010 is very heterogenous across countries, but also across regions within the same country. For example, northern regions of Italy
host much more immigrants than southern regions, which is also true for western regions of
Germany relative to eastern regions.
Preferences for redistribution The average support for reduction in income differences
(variable V1 ) is also heterogeneous across European countries, with higher support in Greece
and France relative to Denmark and Germany (Figure A.3). Preferences for redistribution
have been very stable over the last decades, as the Figure A.4 shows in the Appendix.
Between 2002 and 2016 the average support for redistribution has varied by at most 10%
relative to its initial level, and this is true for every European country. How attitudes
towards redistribution would have looked liked in the absence of immigration remains an
open question. In order to estimate the no-immigration counterfactual, we will exploit
sources of variation in individual attitudes across regions within the same country. Indeed,
Figure 2 shows that there is a significant within-country variability in the average support
for redistribution: for example, there is lower support for redistribution in western regions of
Germany relative to eastern regions, as well as in the North of Italy relative to the South.16

16

A variance-decomposition analysis reveals that, at the regional level, 35% of the variation in attitudes is

due to within-country variation. On differences between Western and Eastern parts of Germany, see Alesina
and Fuchs-Schündeln (2007)

Empirical strategy

3.1

Specification

We estimate the following linear regression for native-born individual i, living in region n of
country c at survey round t:
yinct = M ignt β + Xit α + Znt λ + δct + int

(1)

where yint is individual i’ s support for redistribution as described in the data section.
M ignt is the share of immigrants (i.e. foreign born) in the population of region n at the
beginning of the decade of year t. Given the skewness of the distribution of the share of
foreign-born, we use the logarithm of the population share in the empirical estimation.17
The regression includes country-year fixed effect δct . The vector Znt includes controls at the

The results remain robust when using a quadratic specification. Details are available from the authors.

and the share of tertiary educated among the native population. The vector Xit controls
for individual socio-demographic characteristics, such as the respondent’s gender, age, education, main activity during the week before the interview, the size of his/her household,
parental education and immigration background, as well as usual place of residence. We
test the sensitivity of the results to the inclusion of a richer set of individual controls related
either to the individual’s income and social class18 or to the individual’s political views and
ideology.19 We cluster standard errors at the region-by-year level to account for possible

Current or former occupation (2-digits isco88 categories), household income quintile, and self-assessed

correlation of the individual-level residuals int within the same region and year.
The specification we propose exploits cross-sectional variations in the immigrants’ share
across regions within the same country. In theory we could effectively include a set of
region fixed effects in order to control for time-invariant heterogeneity at the regional level.
However, we face data constraints that precludes us from exploiting variation over time
in individual attitudes. The ESS is a repeated cross-section of individual interviews, not
a longitudinal survey. Furthermore, the ESS is not representative at the regional level,
but only at the country level. This lack of representativeness results in that the regional
average of individual attitudes cannot be compared over time (i.e., from one survey rounds
to another) in a meaningful way, because the pool of respondents varies and is not sampled
in a representative way. Also, as previously documented, attitudes appear quite persistent
over time (at the country level). This suggests that a cross-sectional empirical specification
might be more appropriate to capture the long to medium-run effect of immigration, relative
to a Diff-in-Diff regression exploiting short-term variations in attitudes.

3.2

Endogeneity

In cross-country studies about immigration and redistribution, a key endogeneity question is
the self-selection of immigrants, the ”welfare magnet” issue. It is possible that immigrants
self-select in places with more generous welfare policies, although it is not a priori obvious
whether this would imply that preferences for redistribution change more drastically in these
places. On the one hand, in places with more generous welfare polices poorer immigrants
”cost” (or are perceived to cost) more to the natives, on the other hand the natives must be in
principle more favorable to the welfare state by reveled preferences. As already emphasized,
the unit of observation in this study is the region; hence, the country-year fixed effects control
for country-level heterogeneity and hold constant welfare policies set at the national level.
However, immigrants are not randomly distributed across regions within the same country.
Thus, it could still be that immigrants are attracted by regions offering relatively more
generous social services (e.g., social housing), even within the same country. In order to
address the issue of potential regional welfare magnets, we exclude Federal countries where
regions have more autonomy to set welfare policies locally. Immigrants may also reside
in relatively poorer regions (e.g. due to constraints on the housing market), where people
have higher (or lower) preferences for redistribution. To test this, we include the share of
15

households in or at risk of poverty at the regional level. We find that the results are robust
to the inclusion of these potential confounders.
An additional concern is that immigrants may self-select into regions with higher economic growth and higher prospect for upward income mobility. Since people have lower
support for redistribution when the prospects for upward mobility are higher, this could generate a negative correlation between support for redistribution and share of immigrants.20
We address this concern by: (i) controlling for long-run regional GDP growth between the
1960s and 2000 (ii) controlling for negative trade shocks and industrial decline over the last
two decades (iii) excluding capital regions, and (iv) using the share of immigrants in 1990
(instead of 2000 and 2010) as main regressor.
Finally we consider the residential choice of the native population, which can be driven
by attitudes toward immigrants. For example, native individuals that are intolerant towards
ethnic minorities are unlikely to choose to live in areas with large immigrant populations.
To the extent that racially intolerant natives tend to have a lower support for redistribution
(as is observed in the ESS survey), this type of residential sorting would yield an upward
bias in any correlation between immigrants’ share and attitudinal support for redistribution.
Given that we find a negative association between immigration and support for distribution
(see next section), this type of bias is not a concern a priori since it plays against us. In
any case, the NUTS regions used in the analysis are very large spatial areas, with typically
around 1.5 millions inhabitants, and always more than 200,000 inhabitants. As Dustmann
and Preston (2001) argues, the ethnic composition of such large areas may be regarded as
beyond the control of individuals whose mobility is likely to be geographically limited.

Results

4.1

Main findings

We begin by establishing that the natives’ perception of the number of immigrants in their
country (at the national level) is affected by the share of immigrants in their residence
region. Table 2 shows that a one percentage-point increase in the regional immigration
share is associated with a 0.3 percentage-point increase in the perceived national share of
20

redistribution see Alesina, Stantcheva and Teso (2018)

16

immigrants. This suggests that the natives’ perception of the identity of potential welfare
recipients (native or non-native) is determined by what they observe locally, i.e. by the local
composition of the population.

Note: The dependent variable is the answer to the question: “Out of every 100 people living
in the country, how many do you think were born outside the country?”, available only in
the 2002 and 2016 rounds of the European Social Survey. Regional controls include: native
population (log), GDP per capita (log), unemployment rate, share of tertiary educated among
the native population. Individual controls include: year of birth*sex , sex*education, household
composition, employment status (unemployed, self-employed, retired..), education of parents and
country of birth of parents, type of respondent’s domicile (big city, suburbs, small town, village).
Individual income controls include: current or former occupation (isco88 2 digits), household
income quintile in the country, and feeling about current household’s income. Ideology controls
include: Placement on left right scale, opinions about whether people should be treated equally
and have equal opportunities, opinions about the importance to help people and care for others
well-being, opinions about whether Most people try to take advantage of you, or try to be fair.
Standard errors are clustered at the NUTS- year level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

Native Europeans display, on average, a lower support for redistribution when the share of
immigrants in their region of residence is higher. Table 3 shows that the negative association
between immigration and pro-redistribution attitudes is very stable across specifications. In
addition to country-year fixed effects, we progressively add to the regression regional con17

trols (column 2), individual socio-demographics (column 3), income and occupation controls
(column 4), and proxies for altruism, aversion for inequality and sense of fairness (column
5). We estimate very similar effects for both measures of preferences for redistribution, i.e.
the index of welfare attitudes that we constructed and the support for reducing income differences. When the full list of controls is included in column 5 of Table 3 , we obtain a highly
statistically significant coefficient of -0.10, which suggests that a one standard-deviation increase in the log share of immigrants (0.62) reduces natives’ support for redistribution by
6.2% of the standard-deviation of attitudes. In order to get some sense of the relative size
of this effect, note that an increase in income by one quintile implies a decrease of 8% of
the standard deviation of preferences for redistribution. The anti-redistribution effect of a
one-quintile increase in the immigrants’ share (i.e., 0.42) is thus about 50% as large as a onequintile increase in household income. We cannot compare the effect of immigration with the
impact of a one standard deviation increase in household income because the income variable
is not continuous but rather categorical in the ESS data. Also, note that, by construction
the share of immigrants at the regional level can only explain variation in attitudes across
and not within regions. We could thus also compare the effects of immigration to the typical
cross-regional variation in attitudes, rather than to the overall variation: a one-standarddeviation increase in the share of immigrants lowers preferences for redistribution by about
20% of the cross-regional standard-deviation of natives’ attitudes.

4.2

Robustness

Table 4 tests the robustness of the results to various issues discussed in section 3.2. Table
4 shows that, relative to the baseline specification (column 1), results remain unchanged
when we use the share of immigrants in 1990 (instead of 2000 and 2010) as main regressor
(column 2). Also, we obtain similar estimates when we: (i) control for long-run regional
GDP growth between the 1960s and 2000 (columns 5 and 6), (ii) include a region-specific
exposure to Chinese import shocks (column 7) or the share of the manufacturing sector in
the early 1990s (column 8), (iii) exclude capital regions (column 4), and (iv) exclude Federal
countries that have more autonomy to set welfare policies at the regional level (column 3).
The robustness of the results holds for both dependent variables (Panel A and Panel B). Only
the inclusion of the regional poverty rate (column 9) generates a smaller and insignificant
estimate of the effect of immigration, but only when the index of welfare attitudes is used

Note: The dependent variable Index of welfare attitudes is constructed as the first component of a principal component analysis using height attitudinal variable (see Data section),
and is available only in the 2008 and 2016 rounds of the ESS. The dependent variable Support for reduction in income differences uses answers to the question as to whether “The
government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels”. All dependent
variable are standardized (Z-score formula). Regional controls include: native population
(log), GDP per capita (log), unemployment rate, share of tertiary educated among the native population. Individual Controls include: year of birth*sex , sex*education, household
composition, employment status (unemployed, self-employed, retired..), education of parents and country of birth of parents, type of respondent’s domicile (big city, suburbs, small
town, village). Individual income controls include: current or former occupation (isco88
2 digits), household income quintile in the country, and feeling about current household’s
income. Ideology controls include: Placement on left right scale, opinions about whether
people should be treated equally and have equal opportunities, opinions about the importance to help people and care for others well-being, opinions about whether Most people
try to take advantage of you, or try to be fair. Standard errors are clustered at the NUTSyear level. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

4.2.1

Placebos

Finally, we run placebos test in Table A.1 of the Appendix, using three attitudinal dependent
variables that should not, in principle, be affected by immigration: attitudes towards the
environment, opinions about traditions and customs, and views on whether it is important
to seek fun and things that give pleasure in life. As already mentioned, we find no statistical
significant correlations for these outcomes.

4.3

Heterogeneity

We now explore various heterogeneity aspects of our main results.
4.3.1

Receiving countries

Table 5 examines the heterogeneity of the attitudinal effect of immigration depending on
the generosity of the national Welfare State. We define the binary variable High Welfare
State that equals one when the country’s GDP share of welfare spending (social protection,
health and education) is higher than the sample median and include its interaction with the
share of immigrants in the regression.21 The inclusion of country-year fixed effects absorbs
the direct effect of living in a High Welfare State on attitudes towards redistribution. We
find that the negative association between immigration and support for redistribution is
significantly stronger in receiving countries with relatively more generous Welfare States
(e.g., Nordic countries and France) relative to countries with smaller Welfare State (e.g.,
the UK or Ireland). Among the latter, the attitudinal effect of immigration becomes much
less significant. Table A.2 in the Appendix shows that these results are very robust to the
different potential confounders that we mentioned previously.

Government expenditures are drawn from COFOG Eurostat data and are averaged over the 1998-2004

variable, we find significant differences in the attitudinal response to immigration depending
on respondents’ education or income. As column 1 of Table 6 shows, the anti-redistribution
effect of immigration is twice less pronounced among tertiary-educated individuals relative to
non-tertiary educated respondents. This finding is consistent with the concept of “educated
preferences”, i.e. the fact that more educated respondents are significantly less intolerant
towards immigrants and place greater value on cultural diversity (Hainmueller and Hiscox,
2007). Also, relative to households in the middle of the income distribution (in the 2nd,
3rd and 4th income quintile), the attitudes of households in the bottom income quintile are
22

significantly less affected by immigration (column 2 and 3). This could be explained by the
fact that, in Europe, tax systems are generally progressive and bear relatively more on the
middle and upper class than on the lower class. As immigrants are often net recipients of
welfare benefits (they take more in benefits than they contribute in taxes), the fiscal burden
of the welfare policies directed towards (poorer) immigrants is more likely to be felt by the
middle and upper class relative to the lower income classes.

22

In column 4, we look at the differential attitudinal response of 6 groups based on income
and education: the poor (bottom income quintile), the middle class, and the rich (top income
quintile), with or without tertiary education. When focusing on the index of welfare attitudes
(upper panel), we find that immigration has the least negative attitudinal effect among poor
individuals without tertiary education (defined as the bottom income quintile). Among this
group, immigration has no significant impact, which can be due to two opposing forces. On
the one hand, low-educated, low-income natives may dislike ethnic diversity and reduce their
support for redistribution when welfare recipients are more likely to be immigrants (Group
Loyalty effects). On the other hand, this group of natives is the most exposed to tighter
labor market competition with immigrants, and may thus demand more redistribution as
an insurance (or compensation) against a higher risk of downward income mobility. We also
find that the anti-redistribution effect of immigration is the highest among middle and upper
class natives without tertiary education. When using the other dependent variable, we find
no detectable heterogeneity in the attitudinal response.
Political affiliation Table 7 shows that the attitudinal response to immigration crucially depends on the respondent’s political affiliation. Relative to center-rightists (i.e.,
non-leftists), the preferences for redistribution of leftist individuals are significantly less negatively affected by the level of immigration. The average negative anti-redistribution effect
of immigration seems almost entirely driven by center-rightist respondents. When using the
index of welfare attitudes as dependent variable, we find no significant impact of immigration on leftists’ attitudes. Given that immigrants are on average poorer than natives, this
result could be explained by the relatively higher aversion of leftist individuals to inequality (or to poverty): the latter likely maintain their support for a system of redistribution
directed towards poorer immigrants in order to mitigate the inequality-increasing effect of
22

Alesina et al. (2018) show that at least for their six countries under consideration, natives in general

overestimate the reliance of immigrants on the national welfare state.

immigration.
Table A.3 in the Appendix shows that, among non-leftist respondents, the attitudinal
response of rightwing individuals (i.e., the 33% of respondents placing themselves at the right
of the political spectrum) is similar to the one of individuals placing themselves at the center
(another 33% of respondent). So the relevant cleavage appears to be between leftists and
center-rightist individuals. These results are very robust to potential confounders related to
within-country immigrants’ selection into region of residence (see Table A.4 in the Appendix).
An additional potential concern is that the self-declared political affiliation is itself endogenous to the share of immigrants. A large literature has indeed documented the effect of
immigration on natives’ political preferences (Halla et al., 2017; Barone et al., 2016; Dustmann et al., 2016). In line with these previous studies, we find that a higher share of
immigrants in the residence region is significantly associated with a higher probability that
natives self-report as center-rightist. This could potentially generate statistical biases in
the OLS estimate of the attitudinal response of rightist individuals (see section 6.3 in the
Appendix for a more thorough explanation).23 To address this issue, we derive econometric
bounds à la Lee (2009) based on a set of weak assumptions (see derivation in Appendix). In
Table A.8, we find that, reassuringly, the upper bound of the attitudinal effect of immigration
remains significantly negative among center-rightist individuals.
Attitudes towards immigrants Table 8 examines the heterogeneity of the results depending on individual attitudes towards immigrants. Relative to other natives, respondents
who think that immigrants make the country a worse place to live (about 30% of the sample)
lower their support for redistribution significantly more in response to higher levels of immigration. Similarly, the native individuals who consider that migrants should have no rights
to welfare until they become citizens are more negatively affected by immigration. These
findings hold for both attitudinal dependent variables, but the differential response is larger
for the index of welfare attitudes: relative to other natives, the anti-redistribution effect of
23

The bias may arise because the individuals who change their political affiliation (from left to right) in

response to higher immigration may display attitudes towards redistribution that are systematically different
from the rest of the sample. For example, if those who change their reported political preferences due to
higher immigration are also particularly against redistribution (for reasons independent of immigration),
this would generate a negative bias in the OLS estimate of the effect of immigration on rightist ’support for
redistribution.

25

immigration is about twice stronger for natives with anti-immigrants views.
The same issue of endogeneity as in the case of political affiliation may arise, however,
about natives’ sentiments towards immigrants. We take into account this endogeneity by
deriving the same econometric bounds as mentioned above. When we examine the attitudinal
effect of immigration on natives who think that immigrants make the country a worse place
to live, we find that, reassuringly, the upper bound of the effect remains significantly negative
(see Table A.9 in the Appendix). When we look at the attitudinal effect on natives who
think that immigrants should have no rights to welfare, the upper bound we estimate fails
to reject the possibility that the true effect is zero (see Table A.10 the Appendix).
Table A.5 shows that the differential effect of immigration along the left-right political
spectrum remains unchanged in magnitude when we allow immigration to have differential
effects across the educational level and the income of respondents, and even his/her views
about immigrants. The differential response of rightist and leftist natives cannot be accounted for by differences in education, income, and attitudes towards immigrants (at least
as captured by the two variables we use). The heterogeneity of attitudinal responses across
educational and income levels seems of a much lower magnitude relative to the heterogeneity
across political affiliations.

Immigrants’ characteristics

Origin countries We investigate the heterogeneous effects of immigrants depending on
their country of origin. We examine origins by broad continents: EU15, East and Central
Europe (including Russia), Asia, Middle-East (incl. Turkey), Sub-Saharan Africa, and the
Americas. Table 9 reveals that, holding constant the number of immigrants (relative to
the population), an increase in the share of Middle-Eastern origins among immigrants is
associated with lower support for redistribution. This means that immigrants originating
from the Middle-East generate a larger anti-redistribution effect relative to other types of
immigrants. This is true for both dependent variables. Using the estimates of the 3rd
column of the bottom panel (when the dep. var. is the support fo reduction in income
differences), we can derive that an increase in the number of Middle-Eastern immigrants by
10% of the total immigrant population reduces natives’ pro-redistribution attitudes by 3%
of a standard-deviation. An increase in the number of non-Middle-East immigrants by 10%
of the immigrant population only generates a reduction by 0.7% of a standard-deviation in
attitudes.

24

This implies that for a given increase in 10% of the immigrant population, the

decline in natives’ support for redistribution will be 2.2% of a standard-deviation larger when
the latter is entirely driven by an increase in Middle-East migrants relative to an increase in
non-Middle-East migrants.
Education and occupational skills

We explore whether immigrant skills shape natives’

attitudinal response to immigration. As in previous literature (Mayda, 2006), we begin by
proxying labor market skills with educational attainment. More specifically, we use the
immigrant-native ratio in the share of tertiary-educated individuals (15-60 years old) in order
to measure the extent to which immigrants are more skilled (educated) relative to natives.
The top panel of Table 10 shows that this measure of relative skill ratio is positively and
significantly associated with natives’ support for redistribution. This means that a higher
proportion of more educated immigrants (relative to natives) tends to mitigate the antiredistribution effect of immigration. In other words, tertiary-educated immigrants generate
a less negative attitudinal response relative to non-tertiary immigrants. The estimates in
24

This is true when the share of immigrants from the Middle-East is equal to the sample average which

stands at 16%. Using the estimates of the bottom panel of Table 9, and noting Fm and Fo the number
of Middle-East and non-Middle East countries, we obtain that dY =

Column 4 of the top panel of Table 10 suggest that a one-standard-deviation increase in the
relative educational skill ratio generates an effect big enough to offset the anti-redistribution
impact of a one-standard-deviation increase in the log share of immigrants.25 This can be
due either to the fact that tertiary-educated immigrants rely less on the welfare system or
because they are more assimilated and culturally closer to natives. In any event this result
holds only when we use the index of welfare attitudes as dependent variable. We find no
statistically significant effect for the other dependent variable (bottom panel).
Due to the imperfect transferability of formal education and the ensuing skill downgrading of immigrants at destination (Dustmann et al., 2012), education may not be an
25

A one standard-deviation increase in the relative educational skill ratio (0.37) translates into an increase

in support for redistribution by 5.7% of a standard-deviation in terms of attitudes while a one-standarddeviation increase in the log share of immigrants (0.62) generates a decline of 4.4% of a standard-deviation

appropriate concept to measure the labor market skills of immigrants. Drawing on 2011
population censuses, we use instead data on the participation of immigrants (and natives) in
various occupations. In particular, we focus on the ISCO category ”elementary occupations”
that consist of simple and routine tasks, including for example taking care of apartment
houses, collecting garbage, simple farming, hand-assembling of components, or simple tasks
connected with construction. Immigrants are generally observed to be over-represented in
those low-skilled occupations, but to different extents across regions.26 We thus use the
immigrant-native ratio in the employment share of these low-skilled occupations in order to
proxy for the extent to which immigrants are unskilled relative to natives. As expected, and
in line with the skill ratio in education, we find in Table 11 that this inverted measure of the
occupational skill ratio is negatively and significantly correlated with natives’ support for
redistribution – as measured with the index of welfare attitudes in the top panel. Using the
4th column of the top panel of Table 11, the estimates suggest that a one standard-deviation
increase in the Immigrant-Native ratio in low-skilled occupations reduces the support for
redistribution by 5.5% of a standard-deviation.
In the top panel of Table 11, the main effect of the share of immigrants seems to become insignificant when we include the skill ratio in occupation. Table A.6 in the Appendix
shows that, when we restrict the sample to center-rightist individuals (for whom the average
attitudinal response to immigration is the strongest), we recover a significant negative association between the immigrants’ share and the index of welfare attitudes. Also, we obtain a
statistically significant correlation between the skill ratio in occupation and center-rightists’
attitudes for both dependent variables (and not only for the index).

26

Overall in Europe the employment share of ”elementary occupations” stands at 20% for immigrants

and 8% for natives. See the Data Appendix for data sources.

Immigrants’ time of arrival We examine the joint effect of the 1990’s population share
of immigrants and of the inflow of migrants between 1990 and 2010 on natives’ attitudes
elicited after 2008. We proxy the inflow of immigrants very imperfectly, using the variation
over time in the immigrant stock. In this way, we estimate whether natives’ attitudes
are differently affected by immigrants who arrived long ago versus immigrants who arrived
presumably more recently. Note that a change in the stock of immigrants is a combination
of different factors (new arrivals, attrition due to death, return migration or emigration to
third countries) we cannot disentangle with in our data. Given the above, it should be clear
that we tend to underestimate recent inflows. Note also that we choose to keep the 2008
round of the ESS attitudinal data to avoid losing half of the sample when using the index
of Welfare attitudes as dependent variable.
When looking at the average effects on either the index of Welfare attitudes in Table
12A or the support for reducing income difference in Table 12B, we find that the share of
immigrants arrived before 1990 significantly reduce natives’ preference for redistribution.
Importantly, this result holds when controlling for recent inflows of immigrants (Panel A)
and thus suggests that earlier cohorts of immigrants continue to have a negative influence
on natives’ attitudes, in spite of the fact that they arrived more than 20 years ago.
The recent inflows of immigrants have a negative effect too, but less statistically significant on average. When restricting the sample to center-rightist individuals in Panel B, we
find that the cohort of immigrants arrived between 2000 and 2010 is significantly associated
with a reduction in center-rightist natives’ support for redistribution, for both dependent
variables in Table 12A and 12B. Interestingly we find no detectable impact for the cohort
arrived in the 1990-2000 period, which indicates that natives are only affected by the most
recent immigrant inflows.
We can compare the relative magnitude of the effects of past stocks and recent inflows
of immigrants on center-rightist natives’ attitudes, using for the example the estimates in
the 3rd column of Table 12A. A one-standard-deviation increase in the 1990 share of immigrants (0.8) lowers center-rightist natives’ pro-redistribution attitudes by 12% of a standarddeviation. A one-standard-deviation increase in the 2000-2010 inflow (0.2) reduces attitudes
by only 5.4% of standard-deviation. The impact of earlier stocks thus appears larger than
for recent inflows.

4.3.4

Residential segregation

For a given number of immigrants in a region, itse effect on natives’ perceptions and attitudes
is likely to depend on whether immigrants are concentrated in ethnic enclaves or are dispersed
across neighborhoods. To investigate this question, we take advantage of a high spatial
resolution data set providing the distribution of immigrants in a grid-cell of 100m by 100m
within NUTS region (see section 2.1.2). We measure immigrants’ segregation using the
spatial dissimilarity index :
J

X tj
1
|pj − p|
2p(1 − p) j=1 T
where pj is the share of immigrant in the grid-cell j, p the share of immigrants in the entire
region, and

tj
T

is the proportion of grid-cell’s population j in the entire region’s population T .

Conceptually, the dissimilarity index measures the percentage of the immigrant population
that would have to change residence for each neighborhood to have the same percentage
of immigrant as the region overall. The index ranges from 0 (complete integration) to 1
(complete segregation).27
Panel A of Table 13A explores the joint effect of the immigrants’ share and spatial
segregation on natives’ attitudes (measured by the composite index). We find that, holding
constant the share of immigrants in the region, a higher segregation of immigrants (higher
dissimilarity) is significantly associated with lower support for redistribution among natives.
A one-standard-deviation increase in the dissimilarity index translates into a decline of proredistribution attitudes by about 10% of a standard-deviation (column 4). This could be
due to the fact that, when the residential segregation is higher, immigrants tend to maintain
their cultural habits and assimilate less into the host society, which tends to increase the
cultural distance to natives.

28

However, we find no significant impact of the dissimilarity

index when using the other attitudinal dependent variable in Table 13B.
Another question we explore is whether, for a given level of segregation, the attitudinal effect of an increase in the number of immigrants in the region is more or less pronounced when
residential segregation is higher. In theory, we can think of two opposite mechanisms. On
27

The dissimilarity index is highly correlated with other measures of segregation, and in particular with

the index used by Alesina and Zhuravskaya (2011), for which we obtain a correlation coefficient of 0.8.
28
Whether residential ethnic clustering strengthens or reduces immigrants’ cultural identity (i.e., the
retention of an affiliation with their origin country) remains a controversial question in the literature – see
for example the conflicting results found by Bisin et al. (2016) and Constant et al. (2013).

37

the one hand, we can expect that the anti-redistribution effect of an increase in immigration
is amplified by higher levels of segregation, that is, when the new immigrants predominantly
self-select into ethnic enclaves, thereby potentially increasing cultural polarisation and the
salience of cultural conflicts with the natives. On the other hand, when segregation is higher,
an increase in the number of immigrants may possibly be less noticed by the native population because the latter is less likely to enter into contact with new immigrants clustered in
ethnic neighborhoods. If so, the attitudinal response is likely to be less pronounced since the
perceived number of immigrants will remain almost unchanged. Table 13B provides evidence
supporting the latter mechanism: we find that the interaction term of immigrants’ share and
spatial dissimilarity is significantly positive. This means that the anti-redistributive effect
of an increase in the immigrants’ share is weaker when segregation is higher. Specifically,
when spatial dissimilarity is one-standard-deviation higher relative to the sample mean, the
anti-redistribution effect of immigration is reduced by about one half (-4% versus -8% of a
standard-deviation in attitudes, as shown in column 4). This result holds when we use the
support for reducing income differences as a dependent variable. When the index of welfare
attitudes is used in Table 13A , we find no detectable heterogeneous effects depending on
segregation.

Conclusion

Europe is becoming more and more diverse. Over the short period we cover, the share of
foreign-born has increased in our sample by 50% on average (from 8.4% in 2000 to 12.8%
in 2015) and has more than doubled since 1980, with about two thirds of the increase
generated by immigration from outside of Europe. While this increase in population diversity
may have important economic benefits in the long-run (Alesina et al., 2016), in the shortrun immigration and diversity are perceived by many as a threat to social cohesion and
put welfare systems (as we document) and democracies (as we have witnessed) at risk.
This paper shows that the increase in population heterogeneity in Europe correlates with
attitudinal shifts against redistribution among European-born voters. This is especially
the case for center-right voters in regions belonging to countries with large welfare systems
and high levels of residential segregation between immigrants and natives. The effects are
also stronger, not surprisingly, when immigrants are less skilled and when they come from
culturally more distant countries.
While our results are consistent with group loyalty effects (i.e., the fact that individuals
prefer to redistribute towards the in-group – people of same race/culture/nationality) and
less so towards the out-group, they are not exclusive of other channels that determine natives’
attitudinal response to immigration.29 Other motives include taxpayers’ fear of having to
pay for the benefits of (poorer) immigrants that are sometimes portrayed as free-riding on
the welfare system. Another possible channel relates to concerns of tighter labor market
competition caused by immigrant labor and native workers’ perception of higher risks of
downward income mobility. To insure against this risk, native workers may demand more
redistribution. Conversely, when immigrants are perceived to complement natives’ labor and
increase natives’ wages, natives may lower their demand for redistribution since they are less
likely to be on the receiving end of the welfare state. As already mentioned, we do not seek
to disentangle these different motives as we believe that such attempt is unlikely to provide
convincing results when using observational data.30 Instead, we focused our investigation on
29
30

The concept of ingroup favoritism has been developed by social psychologists such as Tajfel (2010).
Using survey experiments, Alesina et al. (2018) explore how natives’ perceptions of immigrants influ-

ence their preferences for redistribution and find that beliefs about the origin and economic contribution of
immigrants play the most important role. See also Dustmann and Preston (2007) for an attempt to assess
the relative importance of labour market concerns, welfare concerns, and cultural concerns in determining
attitudes towards immigration policies. See for example Scheve and Slaughter (2001); Mayda (2006); Fin-

for redistribution at the regional level while at the same time accounting in the empirical
analysis for a number of confounders that have plagued previous cross-country descriptive
studies in the context of Europe.

Bounds on the attitudinal effect of immigration among self-declared rightists

6.3.1

Framework

In order to examine how immigration affects the attitudes of self-declared rightists, we estimate
the following linear regression for native-born individual i, living in the region n of country c at
survey round t:
yinct = M ignt βr + Xint α + δct + int if Rit = 1

(2)

among the sample of self-declared rightists Rit = 1. yint is individual i’ s support for redistribution
as described in the data section. M ignt is the log share of immigrant (i.e. foreign born) in the
population of region n at the beginning of the decade of survey round of year t. We include countryyear fixed effect δct . The vector Xint includes controls at the regional level (native population (log),
GDP per capita (log), unemployment rate, and the share of tertiary educated among the native
population) and individual socio-demographic characteristics (gender, age, education, ....) We
cluster standard errors at the region-by-year level to account for the possible correlation of the
individual-level residuals int within the same region and year.
The problem is that rightists’ attitudes is an outcome that is observed only for respondents who
self-declare as rightists, and this selection is potentially a function of treatment. Indeed, we find
that higher immigration levels tend to significantly increase the probability to self-report as rightist
(see columns 1A and 1B of Table A.8) . The OLS estimate of βr might thus suffer from endogenous
sample selection because the treatment variable M ignt also affects the probability to self-report as
rightist. This might generate a bias in the OLS if individuals who change their political affiliation
(from left to right) due to higher immigration display attitudes towards redistribution that are
systematically different from the rest of the sample. Due to this, OLS estimate of βr may not
be informative because the immigration treatment affects the composition of the population of
self-declared rightists.
To address this issue, I use the potential outcome framework (Rubin (1974)) in order to derive
upper and lower bound estimates of a meaningful parameter of interest. Let M be the share
of immigrants in the region of the respondent, which is a continuous treatment variable in the
interval [m0 , m1 ]. I define a set of potential attitudinal outcomes Y (m) which are a function of m,
the share of immigrants. I also define a the potential self-declared political affiliation R(m) that
takes one if the respondent self-report as rightist and zero otherwise. The only population among
which a meaningful treatment impact can be defined is the group of individuals who would always
self-report as rightist, no matter the immigration level, i.e. individuals satisfying R(m) = 1, ∀m ∈
56

[m0 , m1 ] This the only group for which the attitudinal outcomes can be observed for every value
of the treatment (i.e. immigration level). The parameter of interest is therefore the average effect
of migration on always-rightists individuals defined by
θ=

d
E[Y (m)|R(t) = 0, ∀t ∈ [0, 1]]
dm

I assume that the treatment effect is linear, that is, that θ is a constant. It follows that:
θ=
6.3.2

1
E[Y (m) − Y (m0 )|R(t) = 0, ∀t ∈ [0, 1]]
m − m0

Assumption and bounds

I first assume that the potential outcomes Y (m) and rightist status R(m) are independent of
the immigration level M , conditional on a set of covariates X. The set of X include the abovementioned regional and individual controls, and importantly, also the set of country-year fixed
effects. Second I assume a monotone effect of the immigration level M on the self-declared political
affiliation R. These are two standard assumption in the impact evaluation literature.
Assumption 1.

Randomly assigned immigration level M , conditional on X
{Y (m), R(m)} ⊥ M |X, ∀m ∈ [m0 , m1 ]

Assumption 2.

Monotonicity of R in M (no defiers)
R(m) ≥ R(m0 ), ∀m ≥ m0

I can now distinguish different latent groups (which are not directly observable) depending on
their potential political affiliation status. Let define the group A of always-rightists as those for
which R(t) = 1, ∀t ∈ [m0 , m1 ]. Let define the group of compliers Cm as those individuals for which
R(m) = 1 and R(t) = 0 for at leat one t < m . The assumption of monotonicity of R(m) implies
that the observed group {R = 1, M = m} is composed of always-rightists A and compliers Cm . The
observed outcome Y |R = 1, M = m is therefore a mixture of always-rightists and compliers Cm .
Noting pA the population share of always-rightists and pCm the share of compliers, assumptions 1
and 2 imply:
E[Y |M = m, R = 1, X] =

pA
pCm
E[Y (m)|A, X] +
E[Y (m)|Cm , X]
pA + pCm
pA + pCm

Building on Lee (2009), I derive bounds for E[Y (m)|A, X] based on a trimming procedure.
The procedure for the lower bound as follows. As said, the observed group of rightist exposed to
a immigration level m is composed of always-rightists A and compliers Cm . In the ”worst-case”
57

scenario , the highest potential outcome Y (m) of always-rightists is lower than the lowest outcome
of the compliers. In this case, we can remove the upper

pCm
pA +pCm

quantiles from the distribution

of Y |M = m, R = 1, X and use the average outcome for the remaining individuals. This gives us
the lowest possible outcome for always-rightists exposed to treatment m. The upper bound can
be derived in similar way, but now trimming the lower tail of the observed outcome distribution.
Formally, Let q(r) be the r-quantile of the distribution of Y |M = m, R = 1, X. Upper and lower
Bounds of E[Y (m)|A, X] are respectively:
EU [Y (m)|A, X] = E[Y |M = m, R = 1, Y ≥ q(1 − λA ), X]
EL [Y (m)|A, X] = E[Y |M = m, R = 1, Y ≤ q(λA ), X]
with λA = 1 −

P (R = 1|M = m, X) − P (R = 1|M = m0 , X)
P (R = 1|M = m, X)

Indeed, the population share of the latent group of always-rightists pA is equal to P (R(t) =
1, ∀t ∈ [m0 , m1 ]|X) also equal to P (R = 1|M = m0 , X) due to assumptions 1 and 2. Similarly,
it is easy to show that pCm = P (R = 1|M = m, X) − P (R = 1|M = m0 , X). As a result,
λA =

pA
pA +pCm

=1−

P (R=1|M =m,X)−P (R=1|M =m0 ,X)
P (R=1|M =m,X)

When M = m0 , the observed group of rightist R = 1 correspond to the latent group of alwayrightists (under assumptions 1 and 2). And so E[Y (m0 )|A, X] = E[Y |M = m0 , R = 1, X]. As a
consequence, we can obtain an upper and lower bounds of the average effect of immigration on
always-rightist attitudes :

6.3.3

Estimation

In order to estimate λA , I specify a simple linear probability model
Rinct = γM ignt + Xint α + δct + εinct
where Xint is the same set of regional and individual controls as included in equation 2, δct the
country-year fixed effects. Noting m0 the minimum value of M , I obtain an estimate of λA as
λc
A = 1−

γ
b(M ignt − m0 )
γ
bM ignt + Xint α
b + δc
ct

In order to estimate E[Y |M = m, R = 1, Y ≥ q(1 − λA ), X], I first trim the conditional
distribution of Y |M = m, R = 1 by removing observations below the 1 − λA quantile of the
58

distribution of rightists’ attitudes, in each region-year (characterised by M ignt = m). I then
specify a linear regression for the remaining observations :
Yinct = βU M ignt + Xint ξ + δct + inct if Yinct ≥ q(1 − λA ) and Rinct = 1
When M ignt = m0 , λc
A = 1 and the condition Y ≥ q(1 − λA ) does not remove any observations,
so I can use the same model to estimate E[Y |M = m0 , R = 1, X]. Therefore, the OLS estimate of
U
βc
U provides a consistent estimate of the upper bound θ .
Similarly for the lower bound θL , I first trim the conditional distribution of Y |M = m, R = 1
by removing observations above the λA quantile of the distribution of rightists’ attitudes, in each
region-year. I then specify a linear regression among the rest of the observations:
Yinct = βL M ignt + Xint ξ + δct + inct if Y ≤ q(λA ) and Rinct = 1
cL provides a consistent estimate of the lower bound θL . Table A.8 shows
The OLS estimate of β
the OLS estimates (column 2A) and the upper and lower bounds (column 3A and 4A) of the
attitudinal effect of immigration for each attitudinal outcome and for two different of controls,
namely regional controls (columns A) or regional and individual controls (columns B). We find
that, reassuringly, the upper bound of the attitudinal effect of immigration remains significantly
negative among center-rightist individuals.

Bounds on the attitudinal effect of immigration among natives with antiimmigrant sentiments

When examining how immigration affects the attitudes of natives who hold anti-immigrants sentiments, the same issue of endogenous sample selection applies: the regional share of immigrants is
likely to influence natives’ attitudes towards immigrants. Indeed, we find that, in the ESS sample,
a higher immigration level is significantly associated with a lower to probability to report antiimmigrant views (see columns 1A and 1B of Table A.9 and Table A.10). This might generate a bias
in the OLS if individuals who change their views towards immigrants due to higher immigration
levels display attitudes towards redistribution that are systematically different from the rest of the
sample. To address this issue, we estimate the same econometric bounds of the OLS estimate that
we derived previously.
Table A.9 shows the OLS estimates (column 2A) and the upper and lower bounds (column 3A
and 4A) of the attitudinal effect of immigration on natives who think that immigrants make the
country a worse place to live. We find that, reassuringly, the upper bound of the attitudinal effect
remains significantly negative.
Table A.10 shows the OLS estimates (column 2A) and the upper and lower bounds (column
3A and 4A) of the attitudinal effect of immigration on natives who think that immigrants should
have no rights to welfare. For both set of controls (regional or individual), the upper bound we
estimate in columns 4A and 4B fails to exclude the possibility that the true effect is zero.
