Mortality Risks, Health Endowments, and Parental Investments in Infancy: Evidence from
Rural India

ABSTRACT
This paper examines whether increased background mortality risks induce households to make differential
health investments in their high- versus low-endowment children. We argue that increases in background
mortality risks may disproportionately affect the survival of the low-endowment sibling, consequently
increasing the mortality gap between the high- and low-endowment siblings. This increase in mortality
gap may induce households to investment more in their high endowment children. We test this hypothesis
using nationally representative data from rural India. We use birth size as a measure of initial health
endowment, immunization & breastfeeding as measures of childhood investments and infant mortality
rate in the child’s village as a measure of mortality risks. We find that in villages with high mortality
risks, small-at-birth children in a family are 6 - 17 percent less likely to be breastfed or immunized
compared to their large-at-birth siblings. In contrast, we find no significant within family differences
in investments in villages with low mortality risks.

1. Introduction
Both developed and less developed countries have experienced a dramatic
decline in infant mortality rates over the last few decades. World infant mortality
rate is estimated to have declined from 198 in 1960 to 83 in 2001. However,
infant mortality in less developed countries remains high – roughly 10 times the
rate in the developed world. Reducing infant mortality in the less developed world
is thus one of the most important development challenges. The millennium
development goals have set a target to reduce infant mortality rates by two-thirds
from 1990 to 2015.
The direct health benefits of reducing infant mortality are obvious.
However, reductions in infant mortality might also have indirect effects that are
less well understood. In particular, childhood mortality risks are a major source of
risk in the returns to childhood investments. Thus, reductions in mortality risks
could affect parental investments in children, consequently affecting children’s
long term health and economic well being. For example, Dow et al. (1999) show
that the incentive to invest in child health depends inversely on the level of
mortality risks. They find evidence that the reduction in mortality risks due to the
Expanded Programme on Immunization of the World Health Organization
increased parental health investments unrelated to immunization. Similarly,
Estevan and Baland (2007), argue that high mortality risks could lead to
inefficient investments in human capital. They show that the level of child labor
could be inefficiently high when survival is uncertain and parents expect cash
transfers from their children. This is because, given the uncertain survival of their
child, parents tend to favor a certain investment, such as saving, to an uncertain
one, such as human capital.
In this paper, we add to this literature by examining how mortality risks
affect intra-household childhood investments in siblings with different initial
health endowments. We argue that increases in background mortality risks
disproportionately affect the survival of the weaker sibling. Thus, increases in
mortality risk not only increase overall risks but also increase the mortality gap
between siblings with high and low initial health endowments. Since mortality
risks are one of the important drivers of returns to parental investments, we argue
that increases in mortality risks should also increase disparities in parental
investments across high and low initial health endowment children. We
empirically test this prediction using data from rural India. We use birth size as a
measure of initial health endowment, immunization & breastfeeding as measures
of childhood investments and infant mortality rate in the child’s village as a
measure of mortality risks. We find that in villages with high mortality risks,
small-at-birth children in a family are less likely to be breastfed or immunized
compared to their large-at-birth siblings. In contrast, we find no significant within

2

family differences in investments in villages with low mortality risks. This finding
is robust and cannot be explained by either differences in preferences or access to
health infrastructure across high- and low-infant mortality areas.
This paper also makes a direct contribution to the empirical literature on
the effect of endowment differences on intra-household resource allocation
(Griliches, 1979; Behrman et al., 1982; Rosenzweig and Schultz, 1982;
Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1988; Pitt et al., 1990; Behrman et al., 1994; Ayalew,
2005; Datar et al., 2006; Rosenzweig and Zhang, 2006).1 Previous work in this
area has generally treated endowments as observable to parents but unobservable
to researchers. Notable exceptions are the recent studies by Datar et al. (2005),
and Rosenzweig and Zhang (2006) that use birth weight as a proxy for health
endowment and conduct a direct test of whether variation in birth weight across
siblings generates differences in parental investments. We adopt a similar
approach in this paper, but in the absence of good clinical data on birth weight,
utilize birth size as reported by the mother as an indicator of children’s initial
endowment. Birth size is directly observable to parents, and it has also been found
to be highly correlated with birth weight (Moreno and Goldman, 1990).
Therefore, as in studies by Datar et al. (2006) and Rosenzweig and Zhang (2006),
our measure of endowment is likely to be quite close to that used by parents in
assessing the initial healthiness of a child. Additionally, we extend these earlier
analyses, by explicitly modeling and testing for the effect of background mortality
risks on parental investment strategies.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the
data and variables used for this analysis, and discuss our measures for birth size,
parental investments, and background mortality. In section 3, we present a model
of parental investments that motivates our empirical approach. Section 4 discusses
our empirical strategy, and section 5 presents the main results. In section 6, we
discuss additional results from a number of robustness checks, and section 7
concludes.

2. Data and Measures
We use data from the 1992-93 National Family Health Survey (NFHS).
The NFHS surveyed a nationally representative sample of households in India’s
26 major states, and the primary respondents were ever-married women in the 1349 age group. Structured interviews were conducted with the women and the
household in which they resided. Detailed information on the survey is available
1

Behrman et al. (1995) and Behrman (1997) offer excellent reviews of the literature on
intrahousehold resource allocation.

3

at http://www.nfhsindia.org. We use the rural sub-sample of NFHS for our
analysis, which has detailed information on 35,318 children between the ages of 0
and 47 months, born to 26,865 mothers who were sampled from the rural primary
sampling units. As mentioned before, we would have liked to utilize birth weight
information for children as the measure of initial health endowment. However,
birth weight is available for less than 10% of the children in our sample2, whereas
information on birth size (small, average, large) is available for more than 98% of
the children.3 Therefore, for the purpose of our analysis, we first restrict our
sample to mothers with at least 2 children for whom birth size information is
available. Next, we only keep children for whom there is information on at least
one of the parental investments examined in the paper. This reduces our sample
size to 16,088 children born to 7,891 mothers. The exact sample sizes in our
regressions drop further when we exclude observations with missing values for
the particular parental investment being examined, and/or with missing values for
any of the other variables in our analysis.4
We exploit 5 key features of the NFHS for the purposes of this paper.
First, the NFHS collected detailed information on each child born to an
interviewed woman since January 1988/1989. That is, information was collected
on children even if they had died by the time of the survey. For women who had
more than one live birth during this 4 year period (1988-89 to 1992-93),
information was obtained on the 3 most recent live births. This allows us to
examine intra-family resource allocation decisions over a relatively short time
horizon, during which major changes in the socio-economic circumstances of a
family are unlikely to occur. This is important because one might be concerned
that between-sibling differences in birth size and health investments might simply
be a consequence of changes in the family’s socioeconomic circumstance at the
time of birth of the various siblings.
Second, we have information on birth size for almost all surveyed
children, and use this as a proxy for a child’s initial endowment. In some ways,
birth size may be a better measure of initial health endowment for our analysis
compared to actual birth weight. Birth size is mother-reported and therefore,
captures the perceived “healthiness” of the child. Ultimately, it is this perception
2

Missing data on birth weight for a large part of our rural sample is mainly due to the fact that
most deliveries in rural India take place outside of health facilities and are done by traditional midwives who typically do not measure the newborn’s weight at birth.
3
Moreno and Goldman (1990) report that relative size at birth as reported in the Demographic and
Health Surveys (DHS) was of reasonably high quality, and was well correlated with measured
birth weights.
4
In analyses not reported here, we also used the 1998-99 wave of the NFHS (NFHS-2) to estimate
similar models, but our estimates from NFHS-2 lacked precision due to a significantly smaller
final sample of mothers and children. Hence, we only report results from using NFHS-1 in this
paper.

4

that is likely to influence parent’s decisions, regardless of what the child’s actual
endowment may be. In rural households, where the majority of births take place
outside the formal health care system, birth size may be the only indicator of the
live infant’s healthiness to the parent.
Third, the NFHS collected information on two key health investments that
parents make in their children during infancy and early childhood – breastfeeding
and immunizations. This information was collected for a maximum of 3 children
in the family who were born within the last 4 years, allowing us to estimate
mother fixed-effect models.
Fourth, the availability of information on maternal and child
characteristics, as well as on prenatal investments at the time of each child’s birth
allows us to control for observable difference across siblings that may be
correlated with birth outcomes as well as parental investments.
Finally, the birth history information obtained from each mother allows us
to construct a village level measure of infant mortality that captures the
background mortality risk for infants in each village.
The main outcomes of interest in our study are health investments that
parents make in their children during infancy. In particular, we focus on
immunizations and breastfeeding:
1. Whether the child received all age appropriate doses of Polio vaccination.
2. Whether the child received all age appropriate doses of non-Polio, i.e., BCG
and DPT vaccinations.
3. Whether the child was breastfed for at least 6 months.
Health investments such as breastfeeding and immunizations during a
child’s first year are highly recommended by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and are also included as objectives in the various child health programs of
the Department of Family Welfare in India (Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, 2006). In order to increase immunization coverage, the Government of
India started the Universal Immunization Program (UIP) in 1985-86, which aimed
to vaccinate at least 85% of all infants by 1990 against the 6 vaccine-preventable
diseases or VPDs (tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, and
measles). The Innocenti Declaration on the Protection, Promotion, and Support of
Breastfeeding (1990), and the WHO Working Group on Infant Feeding (WHO,
1991) made several recommendations, which state that infants should be
exclusively breastfed for 4 to 6 months. Also, previous research has shown that
breastfeeding protects children from a number of diseases including
gastrointestinal tract infections, and atopic eczema (Kramer et al., 2001). A
systematic review of evidence by the WHO on the optimal duration of exclusive

5

breastfeeding finds that exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months can reduce
child morbidity from gastrointestinal infections (Kramer and Kakuma, 2002).
Data on immunization were collected in the NFHS through the mother
questionnaire for children in the age group of 2-35 months. Mothers were asked
about the immunizations received by each of her eligible children, and where
possible, this information was verified by cross-checking against the child’s
vaccination card. Specifically, the survey asked whether the child had received
BCG, DPT (all doses), Polio (all doses) and Measles vaccinations. We
distinguish between 2 types of immunization coverage – Polio and non-Polio.
Since both the timing as well as completeness of vaccinations are important, we
follow Datar et al.’s (2006) approach and denote a child as having “full age
appropriate coverage” for polio or non-polio vaccinations using Government of
India’s Recommended Immunization Schedule (Table 1). Thus, for example, a
child who is 3 months old, and has BCG, DPT1 and 2, and Polio1 vaccines would
be classified as having “fully age appropriate coverage” under the non-Polio
vaccine category, but would be classified as not having “fully age appropriate
coverage” for the Polio vaccine. This approach allows us to distinguish between
children who receive age appropriate coverage and children who are immunized
at an older (or younger) age and therefore are exposed to the risk of VPDs for a
longer duration of time (or are physiologically not ready for vaccination).
Mothers were asked about their breastfeeding behavior for each of their 3
most recent live births in the past 4 years. The survey questions did not ask about
exclusive breastfeeding, but instead focused on any breastfeeding, including when
it was initiated and how for long it was done. Following the WHO guidelines, our
breastfeeding measure captures whether the child was breastfed for at least 6
months. For the breastfeeding analysis, we restrict our sample to children 6
months and older.
The means and standard deviations of the parental investment variables
and other explanatory variables are reported in panels A and B of table 2 – for
children in our analysis (those with at least one sibling), and the original sample
of children respectively. These suggest that children in our analysis sample are
quite similar to those in the original sample with respect to parental investments
as well as other attributes. Based on the summary statistics for our analysis
sample (panel A), we find that only about 35% of the children were fully
immunized against polio, while only a quarter were fully immunized against nonpolio diseases. In contrast, nearly three-quarters of the children were breastfed for
at least 6 months. This suggests that breastfeeding was fairly widespread in rural
India, compared to immunization.
Birth size information for each child in the NFHS was reported by the
mother retrospectively. Specifically, mothers were asked to report whether a
particular child was “large”, “average”, or “small” when he/she was born, for

6

each of her 3 most recent live births within the 4 years preceding the survey. The
median number of months between the child’s birth and the mother’s report of
that child’s birth size, or the “recall” period in our sample is 22 months or about 2
years.5 Nearly a quarter of all children in our sample were smaller than average
size at birth (hereafter small-at-birth). Additionally, the median age of the mother
at birth was 22 years, the median birth order was 3, and exactly half the children
were male.
There exists a substantial amount of within-family variation in birth size
and parental investments in our data. Table 3 reports the percentage of families
with intra-family variation in birth size and health investments i.e. at least one
sibling had a different birth size or investment compared to the other siblings.
More than 26% of the families in this sample have across-sibling variation in birth
size and in age-appropriate polio coverage, and 22% of the families have variation
across siblings in age-appropriate non-polio coverage. About 41% of the families
have variation across siblings in whether they were breastfed for 6 or more
months.
Finally, we measure background mortality risk by constructing a village
level infant mortality rate. Using retrospective birth history data, we aggregate the
number of children born in a village within the previous 4 years across all women
who were interviewed in that village, and also the number of children who died
before the age of one to construct an infant mortality rate for each village in our
sample. We classify a village as having high background mortality risk if the
infant mortality rate for that village exceeds the median infant mortality rate in the
distribution, which is 7% (same as the mean).

3. Theoretical Framework
In this section, we outline a simple one-period model of parental
investments in children’s health when child survival is uncertain. We follow the
approach of consensus parental preference models (Behrman, 1997) and assume
that altruistic parents maximize their consensus utility function
(1)

U[V(h1, h2,…, hn), Y]

5

This is comparable to the median recall period for birth weight in Datar et al.’s (2006) study that
used the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 – Child Data. Parental recall of birth weight
has been found to be fairly accurate in a number of studies (Walton et al., 2000; O’Sullivan et al.,
2000). Maternal recall of whether the child was born bigger or smaller than average is likely to be
more accurate relative to a numerical birth weight.

where V(.) is a parental welfare function that has as its arguments the adult health
of each child (hi), and Y is the parents’ consumption.
Parents maximize their utility function subject to two constraints: the
health production function for each child and the household’s budget constraint.
The health production function shows the adult health of child i and is increasing
in health and educational investments that parents make in the child (xi) and the
child’s endowment (ei), but is decreasing in the background mortality risk (m) that
the child faces. m refers to the underlying risk of dying due to factors exogenous
to the household.
(2)

hi = h(xi, ei, m)

i= 1, 2,…, n

The budget constraint requires that parental expenditures on their own
consumption and investments in their children’s health not exceed their total
resources (M).
n

∑ xν +Y = M

i

where v is the relative price of parental inputs.
First order conditions from the above model can be written as follows.
(4)

Vh′i h ′x i = Vh′ j h ′x j

∀i ≠ j

The above equation shows that the marginal benefit from investing in each child
should be equal at the optimum. The first term on the left hand side captures the
marginal utility to the parent from an increase in child i’s health. The second term
on the left hand side captures the marginal returns in terms of health from an
increase in parental inputs into child i.
The optimal level of parental investment in each child (xi*) is a function of
the child’s endowment, background mortality risk, price of parental inputs, and
income:
(5)

xi* = xi* (ei , m,ν , M )

In this paper, we are specifically interested in two comparative statics – (a) how
parental investments change as the child’s endowment increases i.e. dxi* dei , and
(b) how parental responsiveness to child endowment changes as background
mortality risk increases i.e. d 2 xi* dei dm .

8

From the first order condition, it can be seen that xH*- xL*, which is the
difference in parental investments between a high (H) endowment and a low (L)
endowment child, depends upon two quantities – (a) the ratio of the marginal
utility of health for the two children ( Vh′L Vh′H ), and (b) the ratio of the marginal
returns to parental investments for the two children ( hx′L hx′H ). The first quantity
depends upon the properties of the parental welfare function V(.) i.e. parental
preferences for equity versus efficiency and whether parents have “equal concern”
for all their children6. For example, all else equal, xH*- xL* is likely to be smaller
for parents who exhibit a higher preference for equity or who have greater
concern for their low endowment child. The second quantity depends upon the
properties of the health production function h(.), in particular, whether the returns
to parental investments are higher for the high or low endowment child. For
example, xH*- xL* is likely to be larger if returns to parental investments increase
with endowments. Therefore, it is a priori unclear whether xH*- xL* is positive,
negative or zero.
The second comparative static examines how xH*- xL* changes as
background mortality risk increases. In general, this effect would depend upon
how the ratios Vh′L Vh′H and hx′L hx′H vary with background mortality risk. An
increase in background mortality risk would reduce the probability of surviving to
adulthood, and therefore returns to parental investments, for all children.
However, the magnitude of reduction in these returns might critically depend on
the endowment of the child. For example, an increase in background mortality
risk might affect the survival probability of the low endowment child more than
that of her high endowment sibling. This is because lower endowment children
might be less resilient and more susceptible to disease. Consequently, the returns
to parental investment in the low endowment child reduce more compared to the
returns to investment in the high endowment sibling. This change in relative
returns implies that an increase in background mortality risk will increase xH*xL*. Changes in background mortality risk, however, might also be related to
changes in parental preferences. For example, parents with a high preference for
equity might choose to live in areas with low mortality risks. Therefore, it is a
priori unclear how changes in mortality risk affect xH*- xL*. Ultimately, how
changes in background mortality risk affect investments in children is an
empirical question which we test in the subsequent sections.

6

“Equal concern” refers to whether the parental preference indifference curves are symmetric
around the 45 degree line. Parental preferences for equity versus efficiency are captured by the
shape of the indifference curves (e.g. L-shaped or straight lines).

9

4. Empirical Strategy
An econometric model for the demand function shown in equation (5) can
be written as follows:
(6)

I if = β1 smallif + β 2 smallif * highmortality f + β 3 X if + γ f + φi + ε if

where “i” indexes child, and “f” indexes family. The dependent variable, I, is an
indicator for whether a child received a specific parental investment or not. A
child’s own endowment is captured by the variable small, which is an indicator
for whether the child was smaller than average birth size.7 The variable
highmortality is a village level indicator for whether the infant mortality rate in
that village was greater than the median mortality rate (7%). The vector Xif
includes other child- and family- specific characteristics that may influence
parental investment, child survival and birth outcomes (e.g. gender, income, price
of health inputs). In addition to these “observed” characteristics are a set of
unobservable factors that affect parental investments – γ f represents unobserved
endowments and environmental influences (pre- and post-natal) common to all
siblings in a family and φi represents unobserved child-specific factors that are
correlated with parental investments and birth outcomes. Finally, ε if is an
idiosyncratic error term.
The key parameters of interest in equation (6) are β1 and β 2 . β1 captures
the effect of own-endowment on parental investment. β 2 captures the additional
effect of own-endowment in areas where the background mortality risk is high.8
The model that we estimate, however, is the following:
(7)

I if = α 1 smallif + α 2 smallif * highmortality f + α 3 X if + γ f + ν if

where, ν if = φi + ε if . While the mother fixed-effect γ f controls for the influence
of all unobserved family specific factors correlated with parental investment and
birth outcomes, one might be concerned that the error term may still include
sibling-specific factors that are correlated with parental investment and birth
outcomes. Below, we discuss 3 reasons why such concerns are minimized. First,
we include a number of sibling-specific controls in Xif such as gender, birth
7

Dow et al. (1999) also use this as their measure of low birth weight.

The direct effect of highmortality, which does not vary across siblings within a family, cannot be
estimated in this model due to the inclusion of the family fixed effect.

10

month, birth order, mother’s age at birth, and a host of prenatal investments in
child i such as whether the mother received iron folic tablets during pregnancy,
whether she was given tetanus injections before birth, and the trimester of her first
antenatal visit. Inclusion of these covariates will absorb a lot of the important
sibling-specific heterogeneity contained in the error term. Second, the siblings
within a family are all born within a relatively short time period. This
significantly reduces the likelihood that aspects of family circumstance, not
already captured by our covariates, changed enough between the birth of the 2
siblings to affect their birth size and parental investments. Third, if the bias from
sibling-specific heterogeneity remains the same across high- and low-infant
mortality villages, then the estimated α 2 will be unbiased, because α 2 captures the
differential effect of being small in high mortality areas.9 In section 6, we test
whether the bias from sibling-specific heterogeneity is the same across high and
low mortality villages.
We estimate equation (7) using linear probability models and adjust the
standard errors for clustering at the family level (Bertrand et al 2004).

5. Results
We begin by reporting estimates from a special case of the model in
equation (7) that assumes there are no differences in parental response to birth
size across high- and low-infant mortality areas i.e. α 2 = 0 . Panel A in Table 4
reports the estimated effects of being smaller-than-average birth size on the
likelihood of receiving age-appropriate polio and non-polio immunizations and
breastfeeding for at least 6 months. We find that children with smaller birth size
are significantly less likely to be immunized against both polio and non-polio
diseases relative to their larger birth size siblings; smaller birth size siblings have
a 4 and 3 percentage point lower likelihood of being immunized against polio and
non-polio diseases, respectively, and both these effects are significant at the 1%
level. However, a child’s relative birth size does not significantly affect her
chances of being breastfed for at least 6 months. Among other covariates in the
model, gender, maternal age and prenatal investments are associated with
immunizations, but not with breastfeeding. Boys10 and siblings born when the
To see this, let δ1 and δ2 be the estimated coefficients on small from 2 separate regressions that
estimate equation (3) using the low mortality and high mortality subsamples, respectively. The
difference δ2 - δ1 is equal to the estimate α2 from equation (3). If δ1 =β1+bias and δ2 = β1+ β2+bias
then δ2 - δ1 = β2.

To examine the hypothesis that parental response to birth size differences between their children
might depend upon whether the small birth size child is a boy or girl, we tested for the interaction

mother is younger and when she took tetanus injections and iron folic tablets
during pregnancy have a significantly greater likelihood of receiving polio and
non-polio immunizations. For breastfeeding, first borns are less likely to be
breastfed for 6 months and younger mothers are less likely to breastfeed for 6
months or more.
Panel B in Table 4 reports estimates from the model in equation (7). The
interaction term tests whether parents residing in villages with a high infant
mortality rate are more likely to adopt a reinforcing strategy compared to parents
in villages with lower background mortality. Our results confirm this hypothesis.
In high infant mortality villages, a small birth size child is about 6 and 4
percentage points less likely to be immunized for polio and non-polio vaccines,
respectively, compared to her better endowed siblings. However, there is no
significant effect of a child’s birth size on immunizations in low infant mortality
villages. Further, the same reinforcing pattern in parental investments is now
observed for breastfeeding as well. In high mortality villages, a small birth size
child is about 4 percentage points less likely to be breastfed for at least 6 months
compared to her larger birth size siblings. As in the case of immunizations, there
is no significant effect of birth size on breastfeeding in low mortality villages.11

6. Robustness Checks
There is some concern that infant mortality rate is not an exogenous
measure of background mortality risks. Thus, it is possible that our results might
be driven by observed or unobserved differences across high- and low-mortality
villages that are correlated with investments in children. To address this issue we
test the robustness of our results for two important sources of heterogeneity across
high- and low-infant mortality villages. The first analysis examines whether our
results are driven by differential preferences for discrimination across high- and
low- infant mortality villages. Our second analysis tests whether our results are

between birth size and gender in an alternate specification (results available from the authors upon
request). The interaction effect was not statistically significant, and all other estimated parameters
were same as before.
11
We also estimated equation (3) with a continuous measure of infant mortality at the village level
instead of the indicator for high mortality. The results were similar to those reported above.
Additionally, we compared villages above the 75th percentile in the distribution of the infant
mortality rate with those below the 25th percentile, instead of looking at villages above and below
the median. Once again, results were similar suggesting a stronger reinforcing pattern in villages
with high background mortality risk.

12

explained by differences in health infrastructure availability across high- and lowinfant mortality villages.12
In the last two subsections we report results from 2 additional robustness
checks. The first analysis tests the sensitivity of our main results to presence of
other small-at-birth siblings in the household. Finally, our last set of tests
examines whether our results can be explained by unobserved sibling level
economic shocks that affect both child endowments and post natal investments.
6.1. Do Preferences for Discrimination Explain the Stronger Reinforcing
Effects in High Mortality Villages?

As discussed in section 3, it may be possible that villages that have a high
background mortality risk are also those that have generally higher parental
preferences for discrimination. If this were true, the evidence of stronger
reinforcing effects in high mortality villages might be the result of such parental
preferences rather than the result of background mortality per se. To test this
alternate explanation, we examine intra-household gender differences in parental
investments across high- and low- infant mortality villages. If the stronger
reinforcing effects in high mortality villages are driven purely by parental
preferences for discrimination then we should find that parents in high mortality
villages are more likely to discriminate between their sons and daughters.
Table 5 reports estimates from models that include an additional
interaction term for male child and high background mortality. There are 3
notable results from this analysis. First, our main finding that parents in high
mortality villages are more likely to reinforce birth size differences remains
unchanged. Second, consistent with the prior literature, we also find that parents
are significantly more likely to immunize their sons compared to daughters. And
finally, the insignificant coefficient on the male-high mortality interaction
suggests that parents in high mortality villages do not have any different
preferences for gender discrimination compared to parents in low mortality
villages.
6.2. Does Differential Availability of Health Infrastructure Explain the
Stronger Reinforcing Effects in High Mortality Villages?

12

Use of natural disaster or epidemics as instruments for background mortality is problematic for
several reasons. First, such disasters and epidemics not only affect infant mortality but also affect
adult mortality, access to health infrastructure and local economies. Second, disasters and
epidemics typically engender an endogenous policy response in terms of increased aid in cash or
in kind to these affected areas. These changes might have a direct effect on childhood investments
independent of the changes in mortality risks.

13

One might be concerned that villages with high infant mortality also have
inadequate health infrastructure. If this were true, the evidence of stronger
reinforcing effects in high mortality villages might be the result of differential
health infrastructure availability rather than the effect of background mortality per
se (Oster, 2006). To address this concern, we examine whether the interaction
between small and highmortality is significantly different in villages that have at
least a Primary Health Center (PHC) compared to villages that do not have a
PHC. 13
Table 6 reports estimates from models that include a triple interaction term
for small, highmortality, and an indicator for whether there is a PHC or bigger
health facility in the village. Two main results stand out from this analysis. First,
parents’ response to differences in their children’s birth size is not influenced by
whether there is a PHC present in the village. And second, the triple interaction
term is statistically insignificant for all investments suggesting that the stronger
reinforcing effect found in high mortality villages is not explained by differences
in health infrastructure availability.14
6.3. Controlling for the Presence of Other Small-at-Birth Siblings in the
Household

As pointed out in Datar et al. (2006), other siblings’ endowments could
also impact the amount of investment parents make in child i. Presence of other
less-endowed siblings in the household might increase or decrease the level of
parental investment in a child because, first, the realization of a low endowment
child might raise parental concern for all children and therefore increase the levels
of all subsequent investments, and second, parents’ ability to either reinforce or
compensate for endowment differences would depend upon the endowments of
other children in the household who compete for the same limited family
resources. Since a child’s endowment is likely to be correlated with that of his or
her siblings, failure to control for siblings’ endowment may lead to biased
estimates of the effect of birth size on parental investments. In addition, it is likely
that presence of other small-at-birth siblings is correlated with background
mortality.
To check the robustness of our results, we re-estimate equation (7) with
the inclusion of another dummy variable that captures whether the child has any
13

Using NFHS data, Datar et al (2007) found that presence of a PHC or bigger health facility in
the village had a significant impact on immunizations, but smaller sizes facilities had no effect.

14

We obtained similar results by reestimating the regressions reported in tables 6 and 7 with a
continuous measure of infant mortality at the village level (instead of the indicator for high
mortality).

14

siblings who were also small-at-birth and are currently alive (results reported in
Table 7). This variable is measured during the first year of child i’s life, when
majority of the immunization and breastfeeding investments are made. The value
of this variable varies across siblings. We find that the presence of other small-atbirth siblings does not have any significant effect on parental investments in a
child – as shown by the estimated coefficients on “any small-at-birth siblings
present”. Moreover, the effect of birth size on immunizations remains virtually
unchanged – both in terms of magnitude and the direction of effects.

6.4. Do Unobserved Economic Shocks Explain the Stronger Reinforcing Effects
in High Mortality Villages?

Finally, as discussed in section 5, there may be concern that our results are
partly driven by unobserved sibling level economic shocks correlated with birth
size and parental investments that vary across high- and low-mortality villages. In
other words, the bias from sibling-specific heterogeneity may differ across highand low-infant mortality villages. To address this concern, we performed 2 tests.
First, we estimated models without child level covariates. The results from this
test are reported in Table 8, and show that the estimates are similar to the
estimates in Panel B of Table 4. Thus, we find that our results are virtually
unchanged when we add child level covariates, including prenatal investments.
Second, we reestimated our models with births spaced within 2 years of each
other. The assumption here is that family circumstances are likely to change
slowly over time and therefore sibling-specific heterogeneity is likely to be
minimal. The point estimates from this test are also similar to those from the full
sample, although the standard errors are larger as we drop more than 75% of the
observations due to the restriction of closer spaced births. Both these tests suggest
that it is unlikely that our results are driven by unobserved economic shocks.

7. Conclusions
In this paper, we examined the relationship between a child’s initial health
endowment, measured by birth size, and parental investments that promote child
health, when infants’ survival is uncertain. Using data from rural Indian
households, we estimated mother fixed-effects models to examine whether there
were any systematic differences in health investments such as immunizations and
breastfeeding across children who were relatively larger-at-birth compared to
their small-at-birth siblings. We found that parents in villages with a high infant
mortality rate adopted a reinforcing strategy of investments in child health
whereby larger-at-birth children were significantly more likely to be immunized

15

and breastfed compared to their small-at-birth siblings. For example, in villages
with high infant mortality, small-at-birth children in a family were 4-6 percentage
points less likely to receive these health investments compared to their large-atbirth siblings. In percentage terms, these amount to a 17 percent, 16 percent, and 6
percent reduction in the probabilities of polio vaccination, non-polio vaccination,
and breastfeeding respectively. In contrast, we found no significant differences in
breastfeeding and immunization rates between small at birth and large at birth
siblings in low infant mortality villages.
These results show that children’s endowment differences as well as
background mortality risk can have sizeable impacts on intra-household resource
allocations in a developing country. They also show that reductions in mortality
can not only improve overall population health but also reduce health disparities.
Reductions in mortality affect less endowed and weaker children more than
healthy children. Thus, they create unique incentives for parents to invest in
weaker children, consequently reducing health disparities.
The results also highlight that public health investments do not crowd out
private investments in child health. In fact, they are complements. For example,
public health interventions that improve birth weight are likely to encourage
parental investments such as immunizations and breast feeding. Dow et al. (1999)
make a similar argument in their study that showed that women were more likely
to increase inputs into birth weight when the United Nation’s Expanded
Programme of Immunization (EPI) was implemented. By decreasing the
probability of child mortality from any of the 6 vaccine preventable diseases, the
EPI increased mothers’ incentives for improving birth outcomes.
