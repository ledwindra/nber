    "abstract": "\n\nTriffin gained enormous influence by reviving the interwar story that gold scarcity threatened deflation. In particular, he held that central banks needed to accumulate claims on the United States to back money growth. But the claims would eventually surpass the US gold stock and then central banks would inevitably stage a run on it. He feared that the resulting high US interest rates would cause global deflation. However, we show that the US gold position after WWII was no worse than the UK position in 1900. Yet it took WWI to break sterling\u2019s gold link. And better and feasible US policies could have kept Bretton Woods going.\nThis history serves as a backdrop to our critical review of two later extensions of Triffin. One holds that the dollar\u2019s reserve role required US current account deficits. This current account Triffin is popular, but anachronistic, and flawed in logic and fact. Nevertheless, it pops up in debates over the euro\u2019s and the renminbi\u2019s reserve roles. A fiscal Triffin holds that global demand for safe assets will either remain dangerously unsatisfied, or force excessive US fiscal debt. Less flawed, this story posits implausibly inflexible demand for and supply of safe assets. Thus, these stories do not convince in their own terms. Moreover, each lacks Triffin\u2019s clear cross-over point from a stable system to an unstable one.\nTriffin\u2019s seeming predictive success leads economists to wrap his brand around dissimilar stories. Yet Triffin\u2019s dilemma in its most general form correctly points to the conflicts and difficulties that arise when a national currency plays a role as an international public good.\n\n",
