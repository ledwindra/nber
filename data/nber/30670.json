    "abstract": "\n\nTeenage drinking is a major public health concern, generating social costs of over $28 billion per year, including substantial external costs associated with alcohol-related traffic fatalities. At the same time, the high rate of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use among teenagers has been deemed \u201can epidemic\u201d by the U.S. Surgeon General, with state and local policymakers turning to e-cigarette taxes as a popular policy tool to curb nicotine vaping. This study is the first to explore the spillover effects of e-cigarette taxes on teenage drinking and alcohol-related traffic fatalities. We find that a one-dollar increase in e-cigarette taxes is associated with a 1 to 2 percentage-point reduction in the probability of binge drinking among teenagers and a 5 to 10 percent reduction in traffic fatalities involving teenagers driving under the influence of alcohol. Together, these results suggest the presence of alcohol-related health benefits from e-cigarette taxation.\n\n",
