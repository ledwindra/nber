    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper investigates how job creation and destruction behavior varies by employer size in the U.S. manufacturing sector during the period 1972 to 1988.  The paper also evaluates the empirical basis for conventional claims about the job-creating prowess of small businesses.  The chief findings and conclusions fall into five categories: (1) Conventional wisdom about the job-creating prowess of small businesses rests on misleading        interpretations of the data. (2) Many previous studies of the job creation process rely upon data that are not suitable for        drawing inferences about the relationship between employer size and job creation. (3) Large plants and firms account for most newly-created and newly- destroyed manufacturing        jobs. (4) Survival rates for new and existing manufacturing jobs increase sharply with employer size. (5) Smaller manufacturing firms and plants exhibit sharply higher gross rates of job creation        but not higher net rates.\n\n",
