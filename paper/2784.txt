FORECASTING PRE-WORLD WAR I INFLATION:
THE FISHER EFFECT REVISITED

ABSTRACT

We consider the puzzling behavior of interest rates and
inflation in the United States and the United Kingdom between
1879 and 1913. A deflationary regime prior to 1896 was followed
by an inflationary one from 1896 until the beginning of World War
I; the average inflation rate was 3.8 percentage points higher in
the second period than in the first. Yet nominal interest rates
were no higher after 1896 than they had been before. This nonadjustment of nominal interest rates would be consistent with
rational expectations if inflation were not forecastable, and
indeed univariate tests show little sign of serial correlation in
inflation.
However, inflation was forecastable on the basis of
lagged gold production.
Investors' expectations of inflation
should have risen by at least three percentage points in the
United States between 1890 and 1910. We consider in an
information processing context alternative ways of accounting for
this failure of interest rates to adjust, for example the
possible beliefs that increases in gold production might be
We conclude that the failure of investors to exhibit

foresight with regard to the shift in the trend inflation rate
after 1896 is not persuasive evidence that investors were
negligent or naive in processing information.

INTRODUCTION

The issue examinedin this paper—closelylinked to Irving Fisher and no
closer to resolution now than when it first arose a century ago—is the puzzling
behavior of interest and inflation rates during the classical gold standard period
before World War I. We focus on the years from 1870, when the post-Civil
War United States declared its intention to adopt gold, to the breakdown of the
international gold standard in 1914. This period ought to be an ideal laboratory
for studying issues in monetary economics, as it included major changes in the
money stock that arose from largely exogenousgold discoveries.
During the first half of this period the U.S. underwent deflation. From
1870 to 1896 the national product deflator of Friedman and Schwartz (1982)
declined at an average rate of 1.1 percent per year, although shorter—termprice

changes were erratic. This trend was then reversed—over the period 1896—
1914, the U.S. price level increased at 2.5 percent per year. A comparable shift
in inflation is exhibited by the Warren-Pearson(1933) wholesale price index. A
similar though less extreme shift for the United Kingdom is seen in the GNP
deflator (Friedman and Schwartz (1982)), in the Sauerbeck-Statist wholesale

price index, and in the Rousseaux WPI (Mitchell and Deane (1965)), Plots of
the American and British price levels exhibit a pronounced "V," with a turning
point in 1896.
Irving Fisher's theory of interest (Fisher (1930)), according to which
nominal interest rates adjust one-for-one to changes in steady-state inflation,
suggests that nominal rates should have been some 300 basis points higher along
the rising portion of the "V" than during 1879-1896. Although in the short run
cyclical movements in real rates (e.g., Friedman's (1965) liquidity effect) might

dominate the relationship between interest rates and inflation, in the long run
there should be a one-to-one relationship between changes in inflation arid

express considerable doubts about this line of thought, particularly the twentyyear lag in the formation of expectations needed if the Gibson paradox is seen as

a delayed Fisher effect.

relation between interest rates and inflation:
during 1898-1905 the increase of prices in the United States is

known to have been due largely to the increase in gold
production.... There seems, therefore, no reason which would
justify the low commodity [real] interest rate of 1.8 percent
which we found to have been virtually paid during that period.
This low rate must, in all probability, have been due to
inadvertence. The inrushing streams of gold caught merchants
napping. They should have stemmed the tide by putting up
interest, not only to 4.6 percent, as they did, but two or three
pertent higher
Such inadvertence on the part of "merchants" is striking in view of
Fisher's incredulity only twenty pages earlier in The Rate of Interest at the
thought that agents might suffer from inflation illusion—i.e. that they do not
notice that their nominal return i is different from their real return r:

Foresight is clearer and more prevalent to-day than ever
before. Multiples of trade journals and investors' reviews
have their chief reason for existence in supplying data on
which to base prediction. Every chance for gain is eagerly
watched for. An active and keen speculation is constantly
going on which, so far as it does not consist of fictitious and
gambling transactions, performs a well-known and provident
function for society. is it reasonable to believe that foresight,
which is the general rule, has an exception as applied to falling
or rising prices?
Summers (1983) used several tools, notably spectral techniques that tried
to capture the long run in which Fisher's effect should hold, and found no

correlation between short-term or long-term rates and inflation rates in U.S.
data before 1940. He concluded that nominal rates had not adjusted to changes
in inflation and that real rates Were persistently affected by changes in monetary
growth:

The data for 1860 to 1940 indicate no tendency for interest
rates to increase with movements in expectedinflation.... [The]
facts... at least raise the possibility that some form of money

6

ForecastingPre-WWI Inflation

illusion infects financial markets. All are explicable by the
hypothesis that before the war agents ignored inflation in
making financial calculations (Summers(1982), P. 232).
Barsky (1987) provided an alternative explanation for the lack of
correlation between interest and inflation rates before 1914. He noted (as did
others, e.g. Sargent (1973), Klein (1975), Shiller and Siegel (1977), Benjamin
and Kochin (1984)) that inflation was serially uncorrelated during this period.

Thus its one period univariate forecast was constant,1 and consequently the
Fisher effect could have been built into the pre-WWI economy yet not be visible
because there were no shifts in expected inflation. Building on the analytics of
McCallum (1983), he concluded that Summers' regressions did not bear on the
truth of Fisherian theory. The lack of correlation between cx Dost inflation and
interest rates could be due to the failure of inflation—largelynoise—to convey
information about future inflation.
Barsky noted that inflation was slightly forecastable by lagged gold
production, but stopped short of examining fully the implications of this
observation. Moreover, the restriction of analysis to parsimonious univariate

models removed from consideration models with long lag structures that might
have picked up a small but importantforecastable component in inflation. Dc
Long (1987) defended the view that pre-WWI data suggest a failure of the
Fisher effect. He aligned himself with Fisher (1930), Friedman and Schwartz
(1963, 1982) and Cagan (1984) in affirming the "traditional" view of price
movements during the gold standard. The traditional view divides the period
into two distinct regimes: an era of falling prices before and an era of rising
prices after 1896, with the switch in regimes triggered by increases in gold
production which were foreseen—or at least foreseeable—by investors at the
time.
1And in fact nearly zero. The average rate of inflation over 1879-1914 as measured by the
implicit national product deflator in both the US and UK is close to 0.4 percent per year.

7

ForecastingPre-WWI Inflation

We thus have two contrasting views of the pre-1914 link between
inflation and interest rates. The view sympathetic to Fisher's theory emphasizes
that hindsight is always 20-20, that the switch in the average rate of inflation
which from an ex tost viewpoint took place in 1896 was not necessarily seen as
such at the time, and that there is little formal evidence that inflation before
World War I was forecastable even with the tools of modem time series
analysis. The alternative, not reconcilable with Fisher's theorizing—though it
does fit his own rather nihilistic interpretation of the empirical evidence—seems

more compatible with the historian's sense that investors perceived, or should
have perceived, long swings in the trend of prices. The present paper brings
together the elements of truth in both views, and assesses to what extent Fisher
was correct in rejecting his own theory on the basis of pre-WWI evidence.
We try to infer what investors should have thought about future inflation
and what investors did think as revealed in the reporting of the financial press.
Most important, we assess the value of information on gold mining in fore-

casting changes in average inflation as they were occurring. Our finding that
gold production helps to forecast inflation (albeit with a small R2) may appear
surprising in view of the fact that gold mining is persistent while inflation
appears white noise. On reflection these observations are not incompatible.
Gold mining conveys a signal about a subtle persistent component in inflation
sufficiently buried in short-term noise as to escape detection by low-order univariate ARJv1A models. Gold production is a necessary cofactor to lend inflation
a degree of forecastabilityas the shift in the drift of prices was occurring. The
coincidence of the expansion of gold production and the shift to upward drift in
the price level lends us confidence—through the force of the quantity theory—
that the "V" in the price level is not a spurious trend like those that chartists find

in random walks.
Because we find some forecastability in inflation and not the slightest hint

10

ForecastingPre-WWI Inflation

In this section we provide a brief survey of the historical circumstances
surrounding the Australian and South African gold discoveries, and the
development and commercial implementation of the cyanide process for gold
extraction. The history of gold production in the nineteenth century is dominated by the two "rushes" of the 1850's and the 1890's From the perspective of
a century or more, these rushes are perhaps best seen as endogenous responses to
industrialization: the gold was there, and would be discovered and mined at
some point if the price of gold were high enough. But from the standpoint of a

a generation, the two

expansions in gold production take on the
character of exogenous shocks to the world's monetary system. Figure 4 shows
contemporaneously availableestimates, reported in the Financial Review Annual
decade or

supplement to the New York Commercial and Financial Chronicle, of world
gold production from the Middle Ages to the outbreak of World War I; figure 5
concentrateson the period since 1800 and shows the same data in the form of the
proportional rate of increase of the world's cumulative mined gold stock.
Annual gold production increased by a factor of five during the gold
rushes of the 1850's, and then leveled off in the 1870's and 1880's. Gold
production then doubled from its level during the 1870's and 1880's in the
1890's, and had doubled once again by 1910. The proportional rate of increase
in the world's gold stock thus exhibits two peaks, in the 1850's and 19 10's, and

an intermediate trough. The two rushes are not of negligible magnitude: they
each increased the world's total mined gold supply relative to trend by a third.

The gold rushesof the 1850's raised North America and Australia to the
ranks of the world's largest gold producers.

The expansion of gold production
was very rapid. Gold deposits were rich and could be mined by hand. No great
input of capital or infrastructure was required before Australia and North

1020

America could begin producing gold in large quantities.
The 1880's saw the three largest gold producers—North America,
Australia, and Russia, in that order—produce more than three quarters of the
total addition to the world's gold supply (Financial Review Annual(1913)). A
small discovery of deposits in South Africa led to prospecting which culminated

in the discovery of the main reef of gold deposits in the Rand region of South
Africa—presentday Johannes-burg—in1886 (Wheatcroft (1985)). The 1890's
saw significant discoveries in Australia and in North America. By 1906-1910
Australian and North American production had each tripled relative to their
1886-1890 levels. Of the "big three" of gold producers before 1890, only
Russia had failed to significantly increase its gold output. But the most dramatic
addition to gold output in the post-1890 period came from the exploitation of
South African gold deposits in particular the Rand.

In spite of the discovery of the Rand gold reef in 1886, it took almost a
generation for mining operations to become fully established. In 1887 South
Africa produced only 28,000 ounces of gold. By 1890 production was up to
480,000 ounces. This was less than ten percent of the world's gold produc-tion

in 1890, only twelve percent of what the Rand would produce in 1899, and only
a twentieth of what the Rand would produce in the years immediately preceding
World War I. The long lapse of time between the discovery of the Rand on the
one hand and the full establishment of gold mining on the other stems from two
causes: the poor quality of the Rand's gold deposits, and the isolated location of

the gold field. By contrast, the gold discoveries of the 1850's were quickly
exploited.

The Rand gold deposits are the largest and among the poorest in the
world. By 1889—onlythree years after the discoveryof the gold field and after
only some 600,000 ounces had been recovered—goldproduction in South Africa
faced a technological barrier. The remaining gold was spread thinly throughout

be used. The telluride ores of Australia and Colorado can contain up to 40
percent gold by weight, but ores in South Africa contained less than one percent

Finely-ground ore is added to a solution of calcium cyanide and lime. The gold

cyanide process can extract up to nineteen-twentiethsof the gold in the ore (Wise

(1964)). 1 Profitable use of the cyanide process requires the processing of
enormous amounts

of ore.

Gold mining in South Africa was thus a very different industry from the
placer, hydraulic, or lode mining of Australia or North America. Gold mining
in South Africa involved the large scale use of recently-discovered organic
chemical processes: South African gold production was one of the high-tech
industries of the 1890's. The sophisticationof the technology and the large size
of efficient scale quickly led to the consolidation of the South African gold
industry into a tight oligopoly under the leadership of Rhodes and Oppenheimer
(Wheatcroft (1985), Flint (1974)).2
When the sophisticationof the technologyrequired to exploit the Rand is
combined with the reef's location far from transportation to Europe, it seems
natural that it might take more than a decade for exploitation to reach full
intensity. In 1886 there were some 1800 miles of railroad laid in South Africa,
but they were concentrated near the Cape of Good Hope to provide a network
for the export of agricultural products. The furthest north the railroad line
'One major source of increased production in Australia and North America after 1890was the use
of the cyanide extractionprocess on the tailings left behind by earlier gold mining operations
2The rapid concentration of the South African gold industry is strongly suggestive of the presence
of economies of scale of the sort that Chandler(1978) argues lie behind the formation of large,
hierarchically-managed, oligopolistic business organizations in the U.S. in the late nineteenth
century.

from Cape Town reached in 1886 was the diamond town of Kimberly on the
border of what was then the Orange Free State, still some 300 miles from
Johannesburg (Hobson (1900), Wheatcroft(1985)).
By 1895 railroad mileage had doubled from 1886, and Johannesburg was
connected by rail to seaports from Cape Town on the Atlantic to Lorenco
Marques in Mozambique (Wheatcroft (1985)). The tremendous investment
required to establish the South African mining industry and link it to industrial
Europe was being made. By 1913 British capital invested in South Africa
amounted to some £27 per capita—about equal to a year's worth of South
African gross national product, More Western European capital was invested
per capita in South Africa than in any other area of the globe outside the regions
of mass European migration and settlement of Argentina, Australasia, and
Canada (De Long (1988)).
There is reason to believe that analysts could have foreseen the expansion
in production before it was well under way (Wheatcroft (1986)). This point is
reinforced by parallels between the gold discoveries at the end and in the middle
of the nineteenth century. The gold booms of the 1850's and the 1890's involved
very similar sudden shifts in the rate at which the world's total supply of gold
was increasing. Anyone who believed that investors and traders have to learn
how prices respond to shocks still has to confront the fact that investors and
traders could learn about the shifts in the monetary environment likely to come

in the 1890's by studying the 1850's before she can conclude that the effects of
the Rand took the world by surprise.
From the perspective of an investor in the 1890's, uncertainties intervene.
Before anyone could conclude that the rush of the 1890's was of a magnitude
similar to the rush of the 1850's, she would have had to resolve three questions:
First, how fast would the gold of South Africa be mined? Second, how long
would the gold last? Third, would there be any offsets from central bank beha-

ForecastingPre-WWI Inflation

15

vior? Would the increase in total gold induce an increase in private gold
reserves, an increase in sterile public gold holdings, a substitution of gold cash
for fiduciary money, or even an expansion in the gold area itself? Disturbing
causes at any one of these points could interruptthe transmission mechanism that
leads from the gold stock to the price level.

III. STATISTICALFORECASTSOF INFLATION
ARIMA Characterizationsof Price Level Dynamics
As Barsky (1987) argued, the absence of any correlation between cx post
inflation rates and nominal interest rates may not be strong evidence against the

Fisher effect. If inflation was unforecastable, there would be no correlation
between ex post inflation and interest rates even if the Fisher effect did hold.
One way to assess the forecastability of inflation is to estimate univariate
stochastic processes for inflation and see how much of inflation variance is
predictable from its own past. A lack of serial correlation in inflation might be
a sign that investors before WWI found inflation very difficult to forecast. BoxJenkins procedures do identify the price level over 1870-1914 as a random walk
with little drift, and the inflation rate consequentlyas approximately zero-mean
white noise, in both the U.S. and the U.K.:

These tests do not reject the null of white noise inflation. For the U.S.,
statistics are in fact smaller than expected under the null of no serial dependence:
Q(8)=3.2, compared to an expected value of 8 and a .05 cutoff of 15.5, for the
United States. The test statistics suggest some deviations of UK inflation from
white noise: Q(8) = 14.6 compared to the .05 cutoff of 15.5. But test statistics
against the null that inflation is an MA(1) at quarterly levels are all well within
their expected ranges; whatever deviations from white noise do exist in the UK
price level appear to be at short horizons.
The Correlation Between Gold Production and Inflation
Inflation under the gold standard shows little persistence, and the pace at
which gold was mined exhibits great persistence. Yet inflation and gold
production are correlated. The simple correlation between this year's inflation
and last year's gold production is .4 for the United States and .2 for the United
Kingdom using the 1870-1914 sample period, and .3 for either the United States
or the United Kingdom over the 1879-1914 period. A small, but nonzero part

of the year-to-year variance in inflation is forecastable from knowledge of one
lag of gold production.1
The correlation between the persistent gold production series and the
volatile inflation series comes from the association of the upward leap in gold
production in the 1890's with the upward shift in average inflation. But the
correlation is not solely the result of this one shift in gold production.
Wholesale price indices for the U.K. reveal that the correlation between price
changes and gold production holds, for the gold standard country of Great
Britain, just as strongly for the pre-1870 as for the post-1870 period.
1The oniy troubling note is the size of the estimated coefficient of the response of the price level to
an increase in gold production. The quantity theory would lead one to expect a coefficient of one,
yet for the U.S. NP deflator and the British WP index, the coefficient is closer to two—albeit
impreciselyestimated. We discuss the non.structural nature of these regressions in the next
Section.

The predictability of inflation from gold production leads one to expect a
correlation between nominal interest and that portion of inflation which is itself
correlated with gold production. But as table 4 below shows, instrumental
variable regressions of interest on ex post inflation rates—which would produce
coefficients of unity if past gold production was being properly used to forecast
future inflation and if the Fisher relationship held—in every case produce
coefficients that are almost zero.

LearningAbout the Relationshin between Gold and Prices
One objection to table 4 is that even if gold production is useful for
forecasting inflation over 1870-1914 ex post, it is not necessarily the case that

Forecasting Pre-WWI Inflation

19

rational traders and investors could have, or should have, ex ante expected gold
production to be useful for forecasting inflation. But this objection is hard to
sustain if one analyzes the 1895-1913 gold boom in the context of the gold boom

of the 1850's. Wholesale price indices are available for the entire nineteenth
century, and gold has a positive correlation with inflation over every part of the
nineteenth century for the United Kingdom, which was on the gold standard
from the end of the Napoleonic Wars until the beginning of World War I. A
similar exercise cannot be carried out for the United States, which inflated to
fight the Civil War.

Proportionel Increese in World Gold Stock

The constancy of the relationship between the rate

of increase of the world's

gold stock and price increases over the nineteenth century is extraordinary. An
investor using the standard hypothesis-testingmethodology would by 1900 have
been able to reject the null of no relationship between gold production and
inflation at the .05 level. The fact of association before 1900 should have led
investors to pay close attention to gold production in forming forecasts of likely
future price changes in the 1890's and after.

IV. ACTUAL EXPECTATiONSOF INFLATION BEFORE WORLD WAR I
Future inflation is correlated with past gold production. Past gold
production is in investors' information sets. Yet there is no positive relationship
between that portion of inflation forecastable from lagged gold production and
nominal interest rates. It might appear that we can conclude that there is strong
evidence that money illusion was the rule, rather than the exception, before
World War I even among that critical mass of well-informed speculators that
economists argue will tend to drive prices in financial markets toward their

21

Forecasting Pre-WWI Inflation

fundamentalvalues (Friedman (1953)).
But the case for the conclusion that investors ought to have been using

gold production to forecast future inflation rates may not be as strong as it
appears. We have followed the accepted canons of procedure by assuming that
investors know the parameters of the model—that inflation is correlated with
lagged gold production. But if investors are uncertain about the parameters.
then it is no longer clear that the instrumental variables regressions of table four
are powerful evidence against the Fisher effect. Only if investors know a priori
the rate at which changes in the world's gold production translate into changes in
the drift of the price level is it clear that the optimal forecast of inflation would
pick up the shift in the mean rate of inflation in the decade of the 1890's in
which it took place.

In this section we consider not what inflation expectations should have
been but what actual inflation expectationswere and with why such expectations
were held. We examine two bodies of evidence, first the academic debate over

the quantity theory and the causes of secular changes in prices carried out in the
forerunners of the American Economic Review, and second the journalistic
assessments of gold, prices, inflation, and interest rates contained in the London

Economist. Although we find a great deal of interest in the rate of gold
production and the causes of secular price changes, we find no consensus of
informed positions and no explicit forecasts of positive inflation in the years
before WWII.
Academic Opinion

An American bond trader who turned to academic opinion for inflation
forecasts for a model on which to base an analysis of price level changes faced
no easy task, for economists in the U.S. were divided. One could not read the
literature put out by economists in search of an answer unless one was willing to

22

Forecasting Pre-WWI Inflation

become an economist and judge the monetarist-antimonetaristdebate for oneself.
We have argued above that attachmentto the quantity theory would have allowed
investors to recognize the shift in average inflation. However, no investor
approaching the economics debate with an uninformed mind would come away
convinced that the quantity theory was the proper framework to use to analyze
inflation. On the monetarist side of the debate stood economists like Irving
Fisher who were strong believers in the quantity theory and in the close
dependence of the quantity of money on the gold stock. On the antimonetarist
side stood economists like Laurence Laughlin and David Wells who believed in a
"cost of production" theory of the price level.
Laughlin (1894) claimed that "it is arrant demagogism to try to make
cotton growers believe that the free coinage of silver can in any way restore the
price of cotton, when the fall is due to excessive crops." Wells (1895) argued
that "the recent phenomenal decline in prices [over the preceding twenty years]
is due so largely to the great multiplication and cheapening of commodities
through new conditions of production and distribution, that the influence of any

or all other causes combined in contributing to such a result has been
inconsiderable." Wells attributed the decline in the nominal price of wheat to
declines in freight charges, claiming that reductions in transportation costs were
"an agency which sufficiently accounts for a great part of the decline in the price
of wheat, and which would have operatedall the same even if the relative values
of the precious metals... had remained unaltered."
Orthodox monetarist critiques of Laughlin and Wells appear, to us,
convincing. Kinder (1899), for example, points out that transportation costs had
been falling and production growing for decades before 1870 and had not then
been accompanied by falling prices. Irving Fisher (1911) convincingly
decomposeschanges in prices into changes caused by movementsin real income,
by movements in velocity, and by movementsin the money stock. Yet the anti-

23

Forecasting Pre-WWI Inflation

monetarists are not convinced. Of the five joint discussants of Fisher (1911) and
Laughlin (1911) at the 1910 American Economic Association meetings, three
criticize Fisher and support Laughlin on the grounds that the money supply is
endogenous and has at best a tangential relationshipto the gold stock.'
The assessment of American economists as evenly split between
supporters and opponents of the quantity theory is not ours alone. Keynes
(1912), lecturing his students before World War I, declared that in Britain the
dominance of the quantity theory was complete but that in America the profession was fairly evenly split.2 Keynes himself had no doubt but that the
expandedpace of world gold production meant, given the long-run trends in real
production and in financial sophistication, slow inflation. He predicted that "...it
seems likely that the annual rise of prices during the next few years can hardly
be less than two or three percent. Credit booms and depressions are likely.., to
make the upward movement irregular."
The lesson we draw from this is that any American trader who, before
World War I, turned to the literature of academic economics for help in
untangling the determinants of price level changes faced a difficult task. In the
United States a respected economist could be found to set forth either the
conclusion that changes in the long-run rate of drift of the price level were due
to changes in the volume of gold production, or that changes in the long-run rate

of drift of the price level were not due to changes in the volume of gold
production but to "such things as labor unions, monopolies, extravagance, the
tariff, general prosperity, etc." (Houston (1911)). Even in Britain, where the
community of academic economistswas effectivelyunited, they perceived themselves as having little influence on the thinking of people of affairs. Keynes
(1912)—thenstill a strong monetarist— lamented the fact that:
'Fisher's preeminence in this company, although obvious to us, was apparently not clear to

contemporary observers, especially those outside academic economics.
2Keynes attributed this fact to the failure of American economists to read Alfred Marshall.

24

Forecasting Pre-WWI Inflation

a rise in prices always appears to be due to 'conditions of
trade,' and in the case of every article taken by itself a rise in
its price is always due to an increase in the demand for it or to
a decrease in the supply... as a proximate cause. This is the
chief reason why some bankers and many businessmen have
always been inclined to doubt the connection of the level of
prices to the volume of money—becausethey cannot perceive
through what channels the influence of the one upon the other
is exerted.
The disarray of the economics profession in the United States and the lack
of authorityof the economics profession in the United Kingdom made it unlikely
that participants in the financial markets would be taught by economists to use
the quantity theory as a basis for analysis and forecasting.
The Economistand Its Forecasts

We also searched for signs that the commercial and financial world had
reached practical conclusions about the structure of the economy that the
academic world had not. We sought for some sign that the presence of lagged
gold production in agents' information sets did lead at least some to anticipate
rises in prices as a result of gold discoveries.

Our search took us to the London Economist, as the natural place to find

such anticipations if they were held. The London Economist stands out as a
stronghold of the quantity theory throughout the period of the pre-WWI gold
standard. It (August 14, 1897) heaps scorn on Sir Robert Giffin, who had set
himself to demonstratethat "it is the range of prices.., which helps to determine
the quantity of money in use, and not the quantity of money in use which
determines prices," and argues that Giffin's articles themselves demonstrate the
falsity of Giffin's doctrine that the money supply is sufficiently endogenous that
fluctuations

in gold production have little influence on the level of prices. As a

25

Foresting Pre-WWT Inflation

stronghold of the quantity theory, this newspaper should be the locus of much
writing that gold discoveries will change the long-run rate of drift of the price
level. Yet the quantity-theoretic Economist does not forecast that the wave of
gold discoveries in the 1890's will have an appreciableeffect on prices.

It is not clear how much weight we should place on our inability to find
explicit forecasts of future prices that recognize the shift in inflation that took
place around 1896. We have negative evidence only: the dog did not bark in the
night. Nevertheless the fact that this newspaper, with its commitment to the
quantity theory and its intellectual predisposition to analyze and theorize about

the economy rather than merely report, did not make the inflation forecasts we
regard as natural—did not take the linear projection of inflation on past gold
production and use this projection to assess likely future price changes—suggests
that few if any investors in the pre-WWI period saw the two relationships
between gold and money and between money and prices as sufficiently strong
and reliable to be useful for forecastingpurposes.
The Economist does recognize that the world's rate of gold production
has undergone a substantial shift even before the trough of the price level in

In 1895, when the newspaper attempts to assess the likely effect of the
gold discoveries of the 1890's, it looks back to the Australian and Californian
gold rushes of 1848-1851. Some then thought that such a wave of gold
1896.

discoveries must have had large effects on prices. An 1872 letter to the editor
(Thomas Hankey, June 15, 1872) notes that gold production from 1850-1870
was equal to the amount of gold brought to Europe from Latin America over
1500-1800, and asks whether "a great effect [on prices] must not now be
experienced by the additional production of an equally large amount during so
comparativelya short time as twentyyears?"
The Economist's 1872 answer is that it did not, that the rise in gold
production in the 1850's had no appreciable influence on the course of the

26

Forecasting Pre-WWI Inflation

general price level. It stresses how "neutralizing circumstances... the great
increase of population and wealth which has occurred... since 1848" raised the
demand for gold sufficiently that the increased supply did not lead to any price
rises. The conclusion ultimately arrived at is that "we should be inclined to
doubt whether it could be proved that the general purchasing power of the
sovereignhas much diminished since 1850" (June 29, 1872).
According to the available price indices, this assessmentby the Economist
is wrong. Table 5 above reveals that the gold rushes of the 1850's did have an
effect on prices—an effect not statistically significant over 1848-70 in spite of its
large magnitude. The break in the 1850's in the declining trend in prices that
characterizes the rest of the century should have kept the Economist from concluding that there had been no rise in prices as a result of the gold discoveries of
the 1850's. Perhaps distrust of price indices as measures of the true price level
accounts for the position that the 1850's rushes had little effect on prices.

In 1895 the Economist bases its judgment of the likely effect of increased
gold mining on its perception that the burst of mining around 1850 had little

27

ForecastingPre-WWI Inflatior

effect on the price level:
"When some fifty years ago, first California and then
Australia began to pour out.., gold, the Gold Question...
came... to be the great economic question of the day....
Broadly speaking, the general expectation was that, owing
to the enormous increase in output... there would be a great
diminution in the purchasing power of gold or... a great
rise in the prices of commodities.... It did not take long,
however, to prove that... the hopes and fears excited by...
new gold... were greatly exaggerated.... Thus Professor
Jevons, writing in 1863, pointed out that 'even after the
lapse of ten or twelve years, men who give their whole
attention to monetary matters... remain in a state of doubt
as to whether any depreciation of gold is really taking
place'. And as late as 1873, while maintaining that he had
been right in predicting a depreciation of gold, Professor
Cairnes wrote 'It is now generally agreed that within
twenty years a substantial advance in general prices has
taken place. But beyond the general conviction there is
little accord. People differ as to the extent of the advance
and as to its cause.... Amongst economists... it is pretty well
agreed that the advance is... due to... gold discoveries.
But... there is, on the part of commercial writers and... all
who view the question from the standpoint of practical
business, a strong disposition to ignore.., the influence of
this cause" (September28, 1895).
The quantity-theoretic link between the quantity of gold and the level of
prices is thus seen as weak in general. The Economist is doubtful that gold
mining will raise prices in the particular instance of the South African gold
discoveries for at least three reasons. The first is its—ex post false—assessment
that the extent of the Rand discoveries will never match in total volume of gold
those of the Californian and Australian discoveries of mid-century. The second
is the Economist's beliefthat what matters for the price level is the proportional
increase in gold and the gold stock is much larger. And the third arises from the
fact that conditions of production are different, that South African gold mining

28

Forecasting Pre-WWII Inflation

is a very capital intensive industry (September28, 1895) as discussed in section
II above. From our perspective, the Economist was wrong ex post. But it is not
clear that the Economist was wrong ex ante. It certainly is not the case that the
Economist's position can be classified as "irrational" in the sense of having
clearly failed to take account of and consider the arguments for the belief that
the gold discoverieswould raise the price level.
Two further years of gold production do not change the newspaper's
unwillingness to see the Rand gold discoveries as a source of inflation. On
January 16, 1897 the newspaper congratulates itself on having avoided
speculatingabout the likely effects of increased gold production: "When the first
important spurt in the new supplies of gold took place... there was a good deal of
talk about the possible effect of the increased production upon the prices both of
commoditiesand of securities; but no such result has yet made itself apparent.
{T]he fact is that this large increase in the output of gold has produced very little

appreciable effect... for the... reason that... an increased production of three or
four millions a year is, relatively speaking. a small matter." And by July the
Economist suspects that the entire Rand gold field is close to the edge and is only
marginally profitable: "Of the 46 Witwatersrand mines which were crushing
during the first quarter... the yield of no less than eighteen was under 30s a ton,
and only ten mines yielded over 40s a ton. Until very recently the average total

cost on the Rand for working a ton of ore was quite 30s" (July 10, 1897). The
only hope they see for a continuation,let alone expansion, of the pace of mining
on the Rand is

if the employers' cartel is successful at reducing the wages of

Black miners.

The Economist's distrust of the permanence of the higher level of gold
production is still apparent as late as 1904, when its South African correspondent
"The world's output of gold this year will be... not less than
£70,000,000 and is likely to be the greatest on record.... But the discovery of
writes:

29

Forecasting Pre-WWI 1nflatio

new mines is not keeping pace with the exhaustion of those now being worked,
and it seems to me that in a few years the output must reach its zenith and then

gradually decline" (September 17, 1904). If the shift in production was not seen
as permanent, then there is less reason for expectingit to affect the price level.
Some South African mines did close unexpectedly. Wheatcroft (1986
notes in particular the large losses incurred by speculators in the shares of South
African mines in the late 1880's as allegedly promising mines closed. South
African mines continued to be perceived on the London capital market as highly
speculative investments throughout the pre-WWI period, perhaps reflecting
uncertainty about the likelihood of widespreadmine closings.'
Only in 1908 do we find forecasts of inflation. The first comes in a lette.
to the editor. C.H. Bennett predicts that "there will be a rise in about ten years
of between 5 and 15 percent in general prices.., if no other great inuluencc

will naturally lower the price of fixed interest-hearingsecurities in the long run"
(April11, 1908). He sees not only a link between gold mining and prices but
also a link between inflation and the rate of interest. But he speaks of the Fisher
effect—the lowering of the price of fixed interest-bearing securities—as
somethingthat has not yet occurred but that will come to pass "in the long run."
And on December 5, 1908 comes the Economist's attribution of the rise in prices
since 1896 to the increase in the gold stock. In response to the question "Has
Gold Depreciated?" the newspaperanswers in the affirmative: "The quantitative
theory of money, with such modifications as have become necessary with the
wider use of credit, undoubtedly holds the ground."
newspaper eschews forecasts of future inflation.

But even here the

which is to be contrasted with a realized return on South African banking equity of 10.5% per
year over 1870-1913. See Edelstein (1982).

30

Forecasting Pre-WWI inflation

The Economist notes that modem economies can successfully economize

or not on expensive gold: "The spread of banking.. and the developmentof the
use of cheques, have checked a demand for gold which might otherwise have
sprung up.... The effect of this economy is very difficult to measure, but its
direct tendency is unmistakable, and must have been very powerful." Stress is
placed on the increased demand for gold arising from an enlargement of the area
covered by the gold standard. "If other commodities are unchanged, and
population and business are the same, then if a sovereign is reduced to the value

of half-a-sovereign, double the nun ber of sovereigns will be required to make
the same payments," but "the qualification that other things must be the same is
very important..." (December 28, 1872).
To place the concerns of the Economist's editors in an analytical
framework, consider the forward-lookingversion of the simple monetary model
of Cagan (1956) (see Sargent (1979)). Let money demand be given by:
(1)

-X(Ep1-p)

where m and p are the logs of

the money stock and the price level, respectively.
The log of the money stock is the sum of the log of the gold stock and the log
money multiplier:

We assume that the money multiplier may bear a systematic negative relation to
the gold stock: both central banks and private institutions economize on gold
when it is scarce.

is proportional to the rate of increase of the gold stock,

with a coefficient not in general equal to one. The coefficient depends on three
parameters: the money demand elasticity X, the probability p that gold mining
will persist at any present high level, and the value 0 of the parameter governing
the endogenous offset of gold discoveries by changes in the gold ratio within the
world's banking system. If a current high rate of gold mining is thought very
likely to persist indefinitely(p close to one) and if endogenous offset is small (0
near zero), then inflation will move point-for-pointwith gold mining. However,

if the exhaustion of mines is thought a serious possibility or if the endogenous
offset is seen as large, then a rational Economist would not believe that the
expansion of gold production in the 1890's signaled a commensuraterise in the
inflation rate.

Consider what happens in a period in which gold production does in fad
collapse. In such a period, actual inflation exhibits a large negative deviation
from trend with a consequent large real capital gain to the holders of nominal
assets. This small probability of a collapse in gold production is sufficient to
keep the inflation premium in nominal interest rates below the rate that prevails
during a gold rush.
Moreover, from the perspective of an analyst in the 1890's, the past
relationship between gold and prices carries little information about what either

32

Forecasting Pre-WWT Inflation

the offset parameter 0 will be in the changed monetary environment of the end
of the nineteenth century or what the persistence p of gold mining is likely to be
in the new and technologicallyuntried mines of South Africa. Accordingly, a
refusal to take any past correlation between gold and prices as indicative of the

future is comprehensible.

If any set of investors and writers were using lagged gold production to
forecast future inflation, one would expect to find traces in the Economist. It
was a newspaper that had long cherished close connections with the dismal
science. It had no institutional or political bias against the quantity theory—its
very refusals to forecast inflation are in general justified by the language of the
quantity theory. And it paid great attention to the rate at which gold was being
mined throughout the world.
Yet the newspaper always, up until 1908, assesses the confused and
complex situation in such a way as to reject the conclusion that the god

discoveries of the 1890's will be followed by price inflation. And it has good
reasons, or at least defensible rationalizations, for its judgments: the morley
multiplier is changing, the velocity of money is changing, the rate of growth of
real output in the world is changing as industrialization spreads, the increase in
gold mining will have no appreciableinfluence on the rate of growth of the gold
stock, or the Rand deposits cannot be mined for long without becoming
exhausted. Though the newspaper's forecasts are wrong cx post and use of them

of rational expectations and the Fisher
effect at standard significance levels, we cannot bring ourselves to say that the

Economist was not processing available information in a reasonable fashion. E
p..t, their judgments about the structure of the economy and the lessons to be

learned from the 1850's were wrong. But when considered from an
standpoint, their forecasts and arguments appear to be a serious and
theoretically-informed attempt to assess the likely future course of the price

33

ForecastingPre-WWI Inflation

level.

V. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

We have argued that the lack of correlation between interest rates and
that component of inflation forecastable from gold production suggests,
according to the standard rules of rational expectations econometrics, a failure
of investor rationality. Yet this conclusion hinges on two assumptions: that the
real interest rate was stationary over the classical gold standard, and that there is
no "peso problem"—a small probability event that does not occur in the sample
and yet is important enough to have siiificant effects on expectations embodied
in interest rates.

Marginal Product of Capital
Our conclusions could be reversed if there was a persistent, downward
shift in the underlying relevant marginal product of capital around 1896. If
there was such a downward shift, then the Fisher effect could have held and
would in fact have predicted no significant movement in nominal rates: the
downward movement in the ex ante real rate being offset by the upward
movement in the drift in the price level. But Barsky and Summers (1988) and
Hirschfeld (1988) find no trace of such a movement in required real rates of
return. Indeed, they find the required rate of return in the stock market
mirrored the price level, starting to rise a bit after 1896 in both the U.S. and the
U.K, as can be seen in the U.S. dividend yield plotted in figure 12.
There are signs that the productivity of capital in Britain may have
declined significantly in the second half of our sample. Between the peaks of
1898 and 1929, output per capita in Britain rises at the slow pace of 0.3 percent
per year, substantially less than either the 1.4 percent per year recorded over

Forecasting Pre-WWI Inflation

34

or the 1.6 percent per year recorded over 1929-1973 (Feinstein
(1972)). And according to Edeistein (1982), Sixteen out of seventeen industries
have a lower real rate of return over 1897-1909 than over 1887-1896.
Nevertheless, a real interest rate-based explanation of the apparent failure
of the Fisher effect would require that the marginal product of capital in Britain
determine the required real rate of return worldwide. In view of the size of
capital outflows from the U.K. before World War I to countries of European
settlement (e.g., Argentina, Canada, Australia, and the U.S.), we find this
1870-1898

possibilityunlikely.

Free Silver
The assumption that the sample distribution matches the population
distribution (i.e., no peso problem) is on more shaky ground. We have already
discussed the potential peso problem associated with an unobserved collapse of
gold production. There is one additional event that was possible and did not

35

ForecastingPie- WWI Inflation

occur: a political victory for free silver forces in the United States and a
consequent devaluation. The failure of a Fisher effect is stronger in United
States than in United Kingdom data. It may be that for the United States the
magnitude of the apparent failure of the Fisher effect is doubled by the coincidence of the shift in inflation and the defeat of the free silver movement.

Before 1897 it was not certain that the United States would remain on
gold. An investor in London seeking an equivalent sterling rate of return would
have demanded a premium face interest rate on dollar-denominated assets to
compensate for the perceived possibility of United States abandonment of the
gold standard and free coinage of silver. Although the United States did stay on
gold, it would have been irrational ex ante to assume that it would remain on
gold with certainty (Goodwyn (1978)). After 1897, populism disappeared as a

36

Forecasting Pre-\VWI Inflation

political force and free silver disappeared from the political agenda. The
expected depreciationpremium that United States nominal interest rates arguably
commanded over British rates before 1897 was most likely gone by the decade
and a half before World War I (see figure 13).
United States interest rates during the first half of our 1870-1913 sample
may thus suffer from a peso problem. Ex ante sterling-denominated United
States interest rates were persistently lower than ex pot sterling denominated
interest rates. Calomiris and Hubbard (1987) document the association between
changes in United States and United Kingdom short interest rates after 1898.
Using quarterly data, the correlation between changes in commercial paper rates
is .61 and the slope of a regression of changes in United States on United
Kingdom rates is .86 with a standard error of .14. Using annual average data,
the correlation between changes in yearto-year averages is .89, and the regression slope is .87 with a standard error of .12.
Such tight relationships do not hold for the pre-1896 period, when
popuhsm was strong. Using annual average data, the correlation between
changes in short-term commercial paper rates is .53 and the correlation between
long-term bond rates is .04. A considerablepart of the shifts in yields calculated
for United States long-term bonds is due to changing perceived probabilities of
bankruptcy for United States corporations. However, the failure of anything
like interest parity to hold for New York and London commercial paper rates
before 1896 suggests that perceived exchange risk was breaking the link between
short-term rates that one would expect to see under the gold standard.
A difficulty with attributing shifts in the London-New York nominal
interest rate differential to a free silver peso problem is that such an explanation
implies an implausibly high probability of success for the free silver movement.
While the United States was on the international gold standard—1879 to 19 13—
nominal commercial paper interest rates averaged 2.6% higher in the United

37

Forecasting Pre-WWI Inflatior

States over 1879-1896 and 1.6% higher over 1897-1913. If we attribute the
post-1896 drop in the average interest differential by one percentage point to the
removal of a free silver peso problem and agree that the dollar was solidly
established on the gold standard after 1896, then the expecteddepreciation of the
dollar over the 1879-1896 interval was about one percent a year. The sixteen to
one ratio of silver to gold proposed by free-silver advocates implied a maximum
devaluation of the dollar by 25% should a free silver victory occur. Thus the

probability that the gold standard would collapse in any given year must have
been at least four times the expected depreciationof the dollar, or a four percent
chance per year on average. Thus the probability that the gold standard would
survive intact from 1879 to 1896 ws no greater than (0.96)17

0.50.

Such a high probability of free-silver victory fits uneasily with the
assessment of American historians that the populist, free-silver Democrats had
little chance of putting their policies into effect. They were a regional, proinflation interest that developed little support outside their midwestern heartland

(Goodwyn (1976); Hofstadter (1948)). The fact that backing out depreciation
expectations from London-based interest differentials gives such a different
assessment of the probabilities of populist success from the interpretations of
historians gives us pause. It might well be the case that historians, writing with
hindsight, have given the dominance of sound money policies an air of
inevitability which they did not possess at the time, or it might be that other
factors are influencing the New York-London interest differential.

VI. CONCLUDINGREMARKS

Many tests reject rational expectations because orthogonality conditiom
are not satisfied (Rotemberg (1984)). These conditions have the natural
interpretation that forecast errors should be uncorrelated with variables known

38

Forecasting Pre-WWT Inflation

to be in agents information sets. In the historical situation studied here,
orthogonality conditions fail. The expectations of inflation found in interest
rates do not depend on gold production in the same way that actual inflation
depends on production. Such a finding is indicative of suboptimal forecasting if
investors can determine the workings of the economy. But we do not necessarily
see the actual discussion of the relationship between gold discoveries and the
price level contained in the Economist as showing a failure to rationally process
available information. The Economist's model of the economy did turn out to
be incorrect cx post. But this does not mean that the Economist was irrational in
believing that increases in gold production were not likely to be of enough magnitude to change the long-term drift of the price level. The Economist's failure
to predict inflation cannot be easily traced either to an obvious flaw in logic or to
an obvious failure to note pieces of readily availableinformation.
We have argued that the failure of agents to exhibit "foresight" with
regard to the change in the trend inflation rate after 1896, while inconsistent
with some tests of "rational expectations," is not persuasive evidence that
investors were negligent or naive in processing information. Rather, the absence
of a pre-1914 Fisher effect is not completely surprising once one realizes that
previous experience with gold discoveries did not necessarily provide an
adequate basis on which to judge either the extent to which the flow of new gold
would continue at its rapid rate or the extent to which the institutions governing
the velocity of gold might adjust endogenously to the change in the rate of
mining. The fact that there had been a (weak) correlation between gold
production and price changes in the 1850's would not necessarily lead one to
expect this correlation to hold in the differentmining and monetary environment

of the 1890's.
From the perspective of the mid-1890's, how would an investor rationally
decide what structural parameters would be appropriate for understanding the

39

Forecasting Pre-WWI Inflation

future relationship between gold and inflation? These issues are easily
overlooked by the econometrician, who can with hindsight estimate the "true
model" and may ignore the range of parameter values that may have appeared
possible to investors at the time. Economiststoday reach little agreement on the
structure of the economy. Different economists believe that expectational errors

are orthogonal to different information sets. It thus seems overly harsh to
conclude that a failure of expectationsimplicit in prices to match up with a particular favorite model is evidence of a failure by investors to adequately use the
information at their disposal.

APENDIX: THE FISHER EFFECTAS A LONG RUN PHENOMENON
Suppose that one-period invesffiients in real capital yield a risky expected
real rate of return of pt, and let ö be the net real risk premium required on
oominal bonds. Then by definition:

rt

where:

=

pt+ 1.

+

where t+ 1 has the usual properties of an expectational error. In the absence of
:vidence to the contrary, it seems reasonable to assume that rt is a stationary
stochastic process.

The inflation rate pt+l, however, will in general fail to be

tationary. Over a sufficiently long time interval, policies will change or the
underlying structure will change and impart some drift or jump to average
inflation.

The assumptions that the real rate is stationary and the inflation rate is an
integrated process themselves guarantee that in the long run the economy will
exhibit a Fisher effect, that a properly-instrumentedregression of nominal rates
on inflation rates will produce a coefficient of one. 1 Consider such an
instrumental variables regression of it on pt÷ 1, using a valid2 instrument3 xt

11f the inflation rate is stationary, then the Fisher coefficient will be less than one and will be
closely linked to the persistence of the inflation process. See McCallum (1984) and Barsky
(1987).

This is simply a restatement of the point that the Fisher effect is a
proposition about the long run reaction of interest rates to permanent shifts in

the mean rate of inflation. As long as inflation is subject to permanent shocks
and real interest rates are subject to only transitory shocks, an instrumentalvariable regression of interest rates on inflation should yield a coefficient of one
over a sufficiently long sample.1

1Summers' (1983) use of band-spectral regression was motivated by a desire to make
convergence of this coefficient to one more rapid by improving the small sample properties of the
estimate.
