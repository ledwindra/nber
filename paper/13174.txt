Investment and the Cost of Capital: New Evidence from the Corporate Bond Market
Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajsek
NBER Working Paper No. 13174
June 2007
JEL No. E22,E44,E62
ABSTRACT
We study the effect of variation in interest rates on investment spending, employing a large panel data
set that links yields on outstanding corporate bonds to the issuer income and balance sheet statements.
The bond price data -- based on trades in the secondary market -- enable us to construct a firm-specific
measure of the user cost of capital based on the marginal cost of external finance as determined in
the market for long-term corporate debt. Our results imply a robust and quantitatively important effect
of the user cost of capital on the firm-level investment decisions. According to our estimates, a 1 percentage
point increase in the user cost of capital implies a reduction in the investment rate of 50 to 75 basis
points and, in the long run, a 1 percent reduction in the stock of capital.

Introduction

The notion that business spending on fixed capital falls when interest rates rise is a theoretically unambiguous relationship that lies at the heart of the monetary transmission
mechanism. Nevertheless, the presence of a robust negative relationship between investment expenditures and real interest rates—or the user cost of capital more generally—has
been surprisingly difficult to document in actual data (e.g., Abel and Blanchard [1986] and
Schaller [2006]). Similarly, the magnitude of the response of investment to changes in corporate tax policies is a key parameter that fiscal policy makers rely on when weighing the
costs and benefits of altering the tax code. With the exception of Cummins, Hassett, and
Hubbard [1994], whose methodology utilizes firm-level variation in investment expenditures
within a context of a “natural” experiment, researchers have had a difficult time identifying the relationship between capital formation and changes in corporate tax policy (e.g.,
Schaller [2006] and Chirinko, Fazzari, and Meyer [1999, 2004]).1
The empirical difficulties associated with estimating the effects of changes in interest
rates and corporate tax policies on business fixed investment are often blamed on a lack of
identification. At the macroeconomic level in particular, long-term interest rates (through
monetary policy actions) and corporate tax obligations (through investment tax credits or
partial expensing allowances) are often lowered when investment spending is weak.2 In
the extreme, the endogeneity between both monetary and fiscal policy actions and the
macroeconomy may result in a positive relationship between investment expenditures and
the user cost of capital.
In this paper, we revisit this apparent and long-standing empirical anomaly. We do
so by constructing a new data set that links income and balance sheet information for
about 900 large U.S. nonfinancial corporations to interest rates on their publicly-traded
debt. Covering the last three decades, this new data set enables us to evaluate and to
quantify empirically the relationship between firms’ investment decisions and fluctuations
in the firm-specific user cost of capital based on marginal financing costs as measured by the
changes in secondary market prices of firms’ outstanding bonds. Our results indicate that
investment spending is highly sensitive—both economically and statistically—to movements
in the firm-specific measure of the user cost of capital. The sensitivity of capital formation
to changes in the user cost is robust to the inclusion of various measures of investment

Partial expensing allowances permit firms to deduct a portion of their newly purchased capital goods
from their taxable income. In that sense, both an investment tax credit (ITC) and an expensing allowance
raise the firm’s after-tax income when the firm purchases capital goods. The two tax policies, however, differ
in that under partial expensing, the firm is not allowed to claim any future depreciation allowances for its
expensed capital, whereas under an ITC, such a restriction is partly or wholly absent.

opportunities emphasized by frictionless neoclassical models and to an estimation approach
that controls for the potential endogeneity between investment and financial policy at the
firm level.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief
overview of the user-cost framework and review the evidence—at both the macro and micro
levels—on the link between financing costs and investment spending. Section 3 describes our
new data set and highlights its key feature. Section 4 outlines our panel-data econometric
methodology, and Section 5 presents our benchmark results. In Section 6, we consider an
alternative estimation approach that addresses the potential endogeneity between interest
rates and investment decisions at the firm level. This approach involves constructing an
instrument for the user cost of capital that explicitly controls for firm-specific expected
default risk using both option-theoretic measures of default probabilities and external credit
ratings of firms’ debt. Section 7 concludes.

Empirical Framework

In this section, we briefly outline the user-cost framework that motivates our empirical
analysis. We assume that output of the firm in period t—denoted by Yt —is a CES function
of capital (Kt ) and variable inputs (Lt ):3
Yt = (aKtσ + bLσt )1/σ ,
where 0 < a, b < 1 and σ ≤ 1. Letting CtK denote the cost of capital in period t, then the
firm’s desired capital stock Kt∗ satisfies the optimality condition
a

= CtK .

Assuming a simple partial adjustment between actual and desired capital implies the following log-specification for the growth rate of the capital stock:

where the parameter 0 < λ < 1 measures the speed of adjustment to the desired stock
of capital and 1/(1 − σ) is the long-run elasticity of capital with respect to the user cost.
The partial adjustment model is typically implemented empirically with a variant of the

We adopt the convention that the time subscript t on stock variables indicates the beginning of the
period—that is, Kt denotes the stock of capital at the beginning of period t.

where ǫt is a zero-mean random disturbance. In equation 1, the coefficient ratio

identifies the long-run elasticity of capital with respect to the user cost. With Cobb-Douglas
production, σ = 0, and the long-run elasticity of capital with respect to the user cost is
unity. If − ηηyc < 1, then σ < 0, implying that capital and labor are less substitutable
than in the Cobb-Douglas case. By contrast, if − ηηyc > 1, then σ > 0, implying greater

substitutability of capital and labor compared with the Cobb-Douglas production function.
In the neoclassical user-cost framework, pioneered by the seminal work of Hall and
Jorgenson [1967], the incentive to purchase physical capital depends not only on the financial
costs, but also on the price of investment goods relative to the price of output, the rate at
which capital depreciates, any expected gains or losses associated with capital purchases,
and the tax treatment of both capital purchases and the capital income. Formally, the user
cost of capital in period t is given by

where Et denotes the conditional expectation operator based on the information available
at the beginning of period t.
Equation 2 combines the effects of the relative price of investment goods, the rate of
return on financial assets, the depreciation rate, the capital gains term, and lastly, the tax
considerations. Specifically, PtI /PtY denotes the price of investment goods relative to the
price of output; (1 − τt )rt is the post-tax—interest being tax deductible—nominal rate of
I
interest; δt is the time-varying rate of fixed capital depreciation; and Et (∆Pt+1
/PtI ) denotes

any expected capital gains (or losses) stemming from the purchase of investment goods. The
last term in equation 2 captures tax considerations associated with the purchase of physical
capital. In particular, ITCt is the tax credit rate allowed on investment expenditures, τt is
the corporate tax rate, and zt captures the present value of the depreciation deduction that
can be subtracted from income for tax purposes.
To date, empirical research on the effects of fluctuations in the cost of capital on investment spending has encompassed three types of approaches: user-cost specifications, “natural
experiment” analysis, and Q-theoretic frameworks. In the user-cost specifications, the empirical regression of interest is formulated as some variant of equation 1 (e.g., Bernanke,

3

Bohn, and Reiss [1988] and Oliner, Rudebusch, and Sichel [1995]).4 Other formulations such
as Caballero [1994], Tevlin and Whelan [2003], and Schaller [2006] exploit cointegrating relationships to identify the long-run effect of the cost of capital on investment, an approach
that relies heavily on the fact that the relative price of capital goods is non-stationary.
In general, changes in other components of the user cost—namely, interest rates and tax
terms—play a modest, if any, role as determinants of investment spending in time-series
models.
Recent work by Chirinko, Fazzari, and Meyer [2004] combines long-run analysis with
firm-level panel data estimation techniques to estimate the elasticity of capital to the user
cost. Reported estimates of the long-run elasticity in this literature are frequently lower
than unity and, moreover, tend to be estimated with considerable imprecision. Importantly,
these panel-data studies rely on aggregate interest rates when constructing the user cost.
Thus, cross-sectional variation in the cost of capital is obtained primarily from capital goods
prices that are industry specific and, to some extent, from tax effects that vary by industry
owing to cross-sectional variation in depreciation rates.
The natural experiments approach adopted by Cummins, Hassett, and Hubbard [1994]
focuses on episodes where tax changes are comparatively large and account for nearly all
of the variation in the cost of capital. During such episodes, the elasticity of investment
demand with respect to the user cost is estimated to be quite high. More recently, House
and Shapiro [2006] analyze the impact of recent corporate tax changes—as measured by
bonus depreciation allowances—and document a significant user-cost effect at the industry
level. By relying on specific tax episodes, however, this strand of research has been unable
to provide an explicit link between interest rates and investment spending.
Q-theoretic specifications rely on a formal description of adjustment costs, along with
assumptions on production technology, to obtain an empirical relationship between investment and a tax-adjusted measure of Tobin’s Q, which is typically constructed from stock
market data (e.g., Salinger and Summers [1983]). Given the well-documented empirical
failure of the Q-theory, this vein of research provides little guidance to either the short- or
the long-run sensitivity of investment to the cost of capital. Abel and Blanchard [1986],
by contrast, rely on a vector auto-regression (VAR) forecasting system—rather than the
stock market—to construct proxies for future investment opportunities. Their VAR-based
framework considers a linearized model that allows interest rates and output to have independent effects on investment. Although the estimated response of investment with respect
to output is high, the estimated response of investment to interest rates is essentially zero,
a finding consistent with that obtained by Shapiro [1986] from the direct estimation of the
4

The empirical implementation generally includes lags of the dependent variable, lags of the outputcapital ratio, and lags of the user cost as additional regressors. Early examples of this approach include Hall
and Jorgenson [1967] and Eisner and Nadiri [1968].

Euler equations for factor demand.
In a recent paper, Philippon [2007] provides an alternative interpretation of the Q-theory
of investment that utilizes information from the corporate bond market—as opposed to the
the equity market—to construct an empirical proxy for Q. Because bond prices, just like
equity prices, incorporate news about the firm’s future profitability, Philippon [2007] shows
that bond prices are proportional to Q under some mild assumptions for the stochastic
process of aggregate shocks. According to his results, the empirical performance of the
Q-theory based on corporate bond yields is considerably better compared with its equitybased counterpart—the yield-based proxy for Q explains more than a half of the volatility in
aggregate investment in the post-war U.S. data and delivers economically plausible estimates
of adjustment costs.
In our approach, we rely on firm-level data and use yields on the firm’s outstanding senior
unsecured bonds trading in the secondary market to construct the user cost of capital in
equation 2. For our benchmark results, which are discussed in Section 5, we regress firm-level
investment spending on measures of the marginal product of capital and our estimate of the
user cost, a measure that incorporates heterogeneity in interest rates across firms (and time).
The validity of this approach hinges importantly on two related questions: What are the
potential sources of heterogeneity in interest rates across firms, and how does such crosssectional heterogeneity influence investment financing costs? According to the standard
asset pricing theory, cross-sectional heterogeneity in interest rates reflects differences in risk
factors, liquidity premiums, or default risk across firms. Whereas risk factors and liquidity
premiums influence financing costs but are exogenous with respect to the firm’s investment
policy, default risk affects the cost of funds only if bankruptcy entails a dead-weight loss. In
this case, default risk may be endogenous to the firm’s investment policy; moreover, it may
be correlated with unobserved variation in investment opportunities. Controlling for both
the endogeneity and information content of default risk motivates the empirical analysis
provided in Section 6.
Our paper is most closely related to the recent work of Guiso, Kashyap, Panetta, and
Terlizzese [2002], who rely on firm-specific variation in bank lending rates to estimate the
effect of financial costs on investment decisions of a large panel of Italian firms. Although
Guiso et al. find no effect of interest rates on investment spending using OLS techniques,
they document a negative relationship between interest rates and investment when using
bank-specific determinants of loan supply as instruments. Whereas Guiso et al. analyze the
investment behavior of small non-publicly-traded Italian firms for which non-price loans
terms are likely as important as the lending rate, our data, by contrast, focuses on large
publicly-traded U.S. firms that borrow extensively in the corporate cash market, and whose
combined investment spending broadly matches the investment dynamics in the U.S. econ-

5

omy as a whole. In addition, our estimates imply a strong negative relationship between the
user cost and investment when using both simple OLS methods and an IV approach that
takes into account the endogeneity and information content of firm-specific default risk.

Data Description

Our data set is an unbalanced panel of about 900 publicly-traded firms in the U.S. nonfarm
nonfinancial corporate sector covering the period 1973 to 2005. The distinguishing feature
of these firms is that a part of their long-term debt—in many cases, a significant portion—is
in the form of bonds that are actively traded in the secondary market. For these firms, we
have linked monthly market prices of their outstanding securities to annual income and
balance sheet statements from Compustat. We now turn to the construction of our key
variables: firm-specific interest rates and the associated user cost of capital and key income
and balance sheet variables.

Sources and Methods
Bond Yields

We obtained month-end market prices of outstanding long-term corporate bonds from the
Lehman/Warga (LW) and Merrill Lynch (ML) databases. These two data sources include
prices for a significant fraction of dollar-denominated bonds publicly issued in the U.S.
corporate cash market. The ML database is a proprietary data source of daily bond prices
that starts in 1997. Focused on the most liquid securities, bonds in the ML database must
have a remaining term-to-maturity of at least two years, a fixed coupon schedule, and a
minimum amount outstanding of $100 million for below investment-grade and $150 million
for investment-grade issuers. By contrast, the LW database of month-end bond prices has a
somewhat broader coverage and is available from 1973 through mid-1998 (see Warga [1991]
for details).
To ensure that we are measuring long-term financing costs of different firms at the same
point in their capital structure, we limited our sample to only senior unsecured issues.
For the securities carrying the senior unsecured rating and with market prices in both the
LW and LM databases, we spliced the option-adjusted effective yields at month-end—a
component of the bond’s yield that is not attributable to embedded options—across the
two data sources. To calculate the credit spreads at each point in time, we matched the
yield on each individual security issued by the firm to the estimated yield on the Treasury
coupon security of the same maturity. The month-end Treasury yields were taken from the
daily estimates of the U.S. Treasury yield curve reported in Gürkaynak, Sack, and Wright
[2006]. To mitigate the effect of outliers on our analysis, we eliminated all observations with

negative credit spreads and with spreads greater than 1,000 basis points. This selection
criterion yielded a sample of 5,800 individual securities, issued by 926 nonfinancial firms
during the 1973–2005 period.
Table 1 contains summary statistics for the key characteristics of bonds in our sample.
Note that a typical firm has only a few senior unsecured issues outstanding at any point
in time—the median firm, for example, has two such issues trading at any given month.
This distribution, however, exhibits a significant positive skew, as some firms can have
more than fifty different senior unsecured bond issues trading in the market at a point in
time. The distribution of the real market values of these issues is similarly skewed, with the
range running from $1.2 million to more than $6.7 billion. Not surprisingly, the maturity of
these debt instruments is fairly long, with the average maturity at issue of about 14 years.
Because corporate bonds typically generate significant cash flow in the form of regular
coupon payments, the effective duration is considerably shorter, with both the average and
the median duration of about 7.5 years. Although our sample spans the entire spectrum
of credit quality—from “single D” to “triple A”—the median bond/month observation, at
“A3,” is solidly in the investment-grade category.
Turning to returns, the (nominal) coupon rate on these bonds averaged 7.67 percent
7

during our sample period, while the average total nominal return, as measured by the
nominal effective yield, was 8 percent per annum. Reflecting the wide range of credit quality,
the distribution of nominal yields is quite wide, with the minimum of about 1.4 percent and
the maximum of more than 24 percent. In real terms, these bonds yielded 4.8 percent per
annum, on average, during our sample period, with the standard deviation of 1.81 percent.5
Relative to Treasuries, an average bond in our sample generated a return of about 150 basis
points above the comparable-maturity risk-free rate, with the standard deviation of 135 basis
points.
Figure 1 depicts the time-series evolution of the cross-sectional distribution of nominal
yields for the bonds in our sample. For comparison, the figure also shows the nominal
yield on all corporate bonds carrying the Moody’s Baa credit rating. As evidenced by the
closeness of the 95th and 5th percentiles (the shaded band), there is relatively little crosssectional dispersion in corporate yields until the second half of the 1980s. The narrowness
of the distribution before the mid-1980s reflects the fact that the corporate cash market
during this time period was limited largely to investment-grade issues at the upper end of
the credit-quality spectrum. Indeed, during this period, a significant majority of yields in
our sample are consistently below the yield on the Baa-rated corporate bonds, a category
of debt that sits at the bottom rung of the investment-grade ladder.
The increase in the cross-sectional dispersion of corporate interest rates that began in
the second half of the 1980s coincided with the deepening of the market for “junk-rated”
corporate debt. The drift of the aggregate Baa yield towards the center of the cross-sectional
distribution is another piece of evidence pointing to the increased ability of riskier firms to
tap the corporate cash market. The amount of cross-sectional heterogeneity in our sample
is particularly apparent between 2000 and 2003, a period in which the effects of a cyclical
downturn were compounded by a slew of corporate scandals. This combination of the crosssectional heterogeneity in external financing costs with considerable cyclical fluctuations are
factors that should enhance our ability to identify variation in the investment supply curve
and thus help us to estimate more precisely the interest sensitivity of investment demand.

To covert the monthly nominal bond yields into real terms, we employed a simplifying assumption that
the expected inflation in period t is equal to the last period’s realized annual core CPI inflation. Specifically,
letting ikjt denote the nominal yield (in percent per annum) on bond k of firm j at the end of month t, we

User Cost, Income, and Balance Sheet Data

We matched these 5,800 corporate securities with the issuer’s annual income and balance
sheet data from Compustat. Figure 2 compares the aggregate dynamics of investment for
the resulting sample of 926 firms with those of the U.S. economy as a whole. Note that
until the mid-1980s, the growth of aggregate real investment for the firms in our sample
differed noticeably from the dynamics of real investment as reported in the National Income
and Product Accounts (NIPA). The differences between the two series largely reflect the
relatively small number of firms in our sample during this period—indeed, for the first
6 years of our sample period, our panel includes only about 50 firms per year. By the
mid-1980s, however, the number of firms of our panel has risen to about 200 per year, and
the two series in Figure 2 became much more closely correlated.
The evidence presented in Figures 1 and 2 suggests that we restrict our empirical analysis
to the last two decades of our sample period. First, the opening of the corporate bond market

to lower-rated credits, a process that started in the mid-1980s, likely mitigates the sample
selection bias to some extent during this period. Second, starting in the mid-1980s, the
aggregate investment for our sample of firms tracks fairly closely the investment dynamics
reported in NIPA, an indication that empirical results based on this period have implications
for the U.S. economy as a whole. And lastly, the 3/4-digit North American Industrial
Classification System (NAICS) data used to construct the industry-specific components of
the user cost of capital—namely, the relative price of new capital goods, the depreciation
rate, the capital gains, and the tax considerations—are available only from 1987 onward.
In our analysis, the key component of the user cost of capital in equation 2 is the posttax nominal interest rate (1 − τt )rjt , a component that varies across both firms and time.
As noted in Table 1, effective duration varies widely across our sample of bonds. To ensure
that neither the cross-sectional nor the time-series variation in our firm-specific measure of
the user cost reflects variation in the term premiums, we subtracted from each bond yield
h
an estimate of the term premium derived from the Treasury yield curve. Specifically, let rjt

denote the effective (nominal) yield of bond h (issued by firm j) on day t with the duration

10

equal to dhjt and let d∗ denote the “target” duration. Our duration-adjusted yield is then
given by
h
h
r̃jt
= rjt
− [yt (d∗ ) − yt (dhjt )],

where yt (d) denotes the (nominal) yield, on day t, on a zero-coupon Treasury security of
maturity d. We set our target duration d∗ equal to 7 years—around the median duration
in our sample—and we used the daily (month-end) estimates of the zero-coupon Treasury
yield curve from Gürkaynak et al. [2006] to compute the term premium yt (d∗ ) − yt (dkjt ).
Because our income and balance sheet data are available only at an annual frequency,
we converted the monthly bond yields to firm-level interest rates in two steps. First, we
calculated an average bond yield for firm j in month t by averaging the duration-adjusted
yields on the firm’s outstanding bonds in that month, using market values of bond issues
as weights:

where Hjt denotes the number of outstanding bond issues of firm j at the end of month t
h ≤ 1 is the weight for bond issue h. To convert these firm-level rates to annual
and 0 < wjt

frequency, we then averaged the available monthly yields over the twelve months of the
firm’s fiscal year.6 We used these firm-specific interest rates to construct an estimate of the
K
user cost capital Cjt
in equation 2. As noted above, the remaining components of the user

cost—namely, the relative price of investment goods, the depreciation rate, the capital gains,
and the tax considerations—are allowed to vary across 52 industries as defined by 3/4-digit
NAICS. (Appendix A contains a detailed description of all the industry components of the
user cost of capital.)
Table 2 contains summary statistics for selected variables in our final panel data set.
(Appendix B contains a detailed description of the construction of our key variables.) Although our sample focuses on firms that have both equity and a portion of their long-term
debt traded in capital markets, firm size—measured by sales or market capitalization—
varies widely in our sample. Not surprisingly, though, most of the firms in our data set are
quite large. The median firm has annual real sales of almost $4 billion and a real market
capitalization of about $1.9 billion. Despite the fact that firms in our sample generally have
only a few senior unsecured bond issues trading at any given point in time, this form of
publicly-traded debt represents a significant portion of the long-term debt on their books.

For example, for a firm with fiscal year ending in December, the average interest rate in year t is

For a firm with fiscal year ending in, say, June, the average interest rate in year t is calculated as an average

debt on firms’ balance sheet is, on average, almost one-half (0.47), indicating that market
prices on these outstanding securities likely provide an accurate gauge of the marginal investment financing costs. Taking into account the remaining factors that influence the cost
of capital yields an average user cost equal to 0.15, with the standard deviation of 0.05.

Empirical Specification of Investment Equation

Our empirical strategy involves regressing investment on measures of economic fundamentals
and a firm-specific estimate of the user cost of capital calculated using our duration-adjusted
bond yields. In addition to our measures of the user cost and investment fundamentals, we
control for firm and time fixed effects in the regression analysis. Time fixed effects capture
a common investment component reflecting macroeconomic factors, which can influence
firm-level investment through either output or interest rates. We include firm fixed effects
in the regression to control for differences in the average investment rate across firms.

12

Such heterogeneity may arise either because the average level of fundamentals differs, or
because the cost of investing differs across firms in some systematic way not captured by our
empirical proxies. Finally, for the sake of robustness, we also allow for serial correlation in
the investment process by including lagged investment rate among the explanatory variables.
Our baseline empirical investment equation is given by the semi-log specification motivated by the user-cost framework discussed above:


I



K

+ µj + λt + ǫjt ,

(3)

where [I/K]jt denotes the investment rate of firm j in period t (i.e., the ratio of real capital
expenditures in period t to the real capital stock at beginning of the period), Zjt is a variable
K
that measures firm j’s future investment opportunities (i.e., economic fundamentals), Cjt

is the firm-specific user cost of capital, µj is the firm-specific fixed effect, and λt is a time
dummy. In our baseline case, we assume that the error term ǫjt is orthogonal to current and
K
past values of Zjt and Cjt
. To take into account the persistence of the investment process,

we also consider a dynamic specification of the form:

Because investment data are positively skewed—which may create heteroskedasticity in ǫjt
across firms—we also consider a log-log specification, which replaces I/K with ln(I/K) in
equations 3 and 4.
In our baseline regressions, we eliminate the firm fixed effect µj using the standard
“within” transformation. However, the presence of the lagged dependent variable on the
right-hand side of equation 4 implies that the within-firm regression does not yield consistent
parameter estimates. We therefore consider a forward mean-differenced transformation of
equation 4:

valid instruments in the presence of the transformed error term ∆t j (ǫjt ). In practice,
however, we do not use all the available lags as instruments, as distant lags are likely to
be poor instruments. Specifically, our instrument set consists of lags 2 to 5 of [I/K]jt (or

ln[I/K]jt ) and lags 2 to 5 of both ln Zjt and ln Cjt

In both the static and dynamic specifications, we measure investment fundamentals
using either the current sales-to-capital ratio [S/K]jt or the operating-income-to-capital
ratio [Π/K]jt .7 Following Gilchrist and Himmelberg [1998], we construct a measure of the
marginal product of capital for firm j at time t as

where φs > 0 and ψs > 0 are appropriately defined scaling factors that are specific to
the industry s in which the firm j operates. These scaling constants capture the fact that
sales-to-capital and operating-income-to-capital ratios vary substantially across industries,
whereas in equilibrium, the return on capital should be equalized across industries (see
Appendix B for details). We then set Zjt —our measure of investment fundamentals for
firm j—equal to each measure of the marginal product of capital.
Taking logs of MPKSjt is straightforward. It also implies that the scaling factor φs is
subsumed in the firm-specific fixed effect µj . Because operating income may be negative,
7

Both the real sales and the real operating income in period t are scaled by the real capital stock as of
the beginning of period t.

14

we use
ln Zjt = ln(ξ + MPKΠjt )
to measure fundamentals when using operating income as the measure of investment opportunities, where ξ is chosen so that ξ + MPKΠjt > 0 for all j and t. In this case, we first
construct the scale-adjusted marginal product MPKΠjt and then compute Zjt for a given
choice of ξ. In principal, estimated elasticities may depend on ξ. In practice, however,
reasonable variation in ξ has no effect on the estimated elasticities, and we confine our
attention to estimates based on ξ = 0.5. One drawback of both MPK measures is that they
are not explicitly forward looking. However, under the assumption that economic fundamentals approximately follow an AR(1) process, the current value of the marginal product
of capital summarizes its future path and may, therefore, provide a reasonable measure of
future investment opportunities.

Benchmark Results

In this section, we present our benchmark results and examine their robustness using alternative specifications. Our benchmark results are based on the regression specification given
in equation 3 and estimated over the 1987–2005 sample period. In addition to the overall
K
user-cost term ln Cjt
, we also consider the separate effects of its two main components: the

log of the industry-specific tax-adjusted relative price of new capital goods:

To gauge the extent to which firm-specific variation in interest rates is useful in identifying the elasticity of investment demand with respect to the user cost of capital, we also
consider a measure of the financial cost of capital calculated using a common interest rate.
Specifically, we replace the firm-specific interest rate r̃jt in the financial cost of capital term
with the (nominal) yield on Baa-rated corporate debt (see Figure 1); when constructed
in this manner, the cross-sectional variation in the financial cost of capital is due entirely
to differences in depreciation rates and expected capital gains across industries. Table 3
reports our baseline results for the semi-log specification, and Table 4 contains results for
the log-log specification. In both tables, entries in columns 2 and 5 are based on the firmspecific measure of the financial cost of capital; entries in columns 3 and 5, by contrast, are

based on the financial cost of capital calculated using the common Baa corporate yield.
According to entries in Tables 3 and 4, the firm-specific measure of the user cost of
capital is an economically important and statistically significant explanatory variable for
investment in all specifications. For either the semi-log or log-log specification (columns
1 and 4 in Tables 3 and 4), a 1 percentage point increase in the user cost of capital implies a
reduction in the average rate of investment between 50 to 75 basis points, depending on the
16

specification. The investment fundamentals—as measured by our proxies for the marginal
product of capital—are also economically important determinants of capital spending, with
coefficients that are estimated with considerable precision. In both the semi-log and log-log
specifications, the coefficient on the user cost is essentially equal to (minus) the coefficient on
the marginal product of capital. As a result, the long-run elasticity of capital with respect
to the user cost, calculated as the ratio of these two elasticities, is estimated to be -1.11 and
-1.32 in the semi-log specifications and -1.02 and -1.04 in the log-log specification. Note that
from a statistical perspective, all estimates of the long-run elasticities are indistinguishable
from unity, a result consistent with the Cobb-Douglas production technology.
We now consider the effect of decomposing the user cost into its separate components:
the tax-adjusted price effect and the financial cost. The first set of estimates based on this
exercise utilize firm-specific interest rates to construct the financial cost (columns 2 and 5 of
Tables 3 and 4. The second set of estimates, by contrast, relies on the common Baa interest
rate (columns 3 and 6 of Tables 3 and 4).
When using firm-specific interest rates to construct the financial cost of capital, our
estimates imply that both components of the user cost—the price effect and the financing
cost—have economically large and statistically significant negative effects on investment.
In addition, the estimated coefficients on the two components are very similar in size across
all specifications. This result is especially apparent in the log-log specification, where the
estimates of the price and financing cost effects are -0.758 and -0.686, respectively, when
using the sales-based measure of MPK, and -0.461 and -0.477, when using the profit-based
measure of MPK to control for the investment fundamentals. Indeed, we do not reject the restriction that the price and financing cost effects are equal in magnitude in all specifications.
Moreover, we do not reject the restriction that these coefficients are equal and opposite in
sign to the coefficient on the marginal product of capital. Thus all three variables—the
marginal product of capital, the tax-adjusted relative price, and the financial cost—provide
distinct information regarding investment fundamentals, and they all have essentially the
same economic impact on the firm-level investment decisions.8 These results stand in sharp
contrast to those obtained when we consider the effect of financial cost based on the common interest rate. Indeed, when using the aggregate Baa corporate yield to construct the
financial cost of capital, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that the associated coefficient is zero in all specifications (columns 3 and 6 in Tables 3 and 4). These results clearly
illustrate the difficulty of estimating the user-cost elasticity of investment demand in the
absence of variation in interest rates across firms.
In summary, our benchmark estimates imply that movements in the user cost of capital
8
As further confirmation of these results, we also considered regressions of the investment rate on each
term separately. In all cases, we obtained coefficient estimates that were almost identical to those reported
in columns 2 and 5 of Tables 3 and 4.

have a strong negative effect on investment spending. Furthermore, the tax-adjusted relative
price of investment goods and the financial cost of capital constructed using firm-specific
interest rates contain independent information about the marginal cost of investment. According to our estimates, investment responds to the changes in marginal costs in essentially
the same manner as it does to the changes in economic fundamentals, as measured by our
proxies for the marginal product of capital. As a result, the long-run elasticity of capital
18

with respect to the user cost is estimated to be unity.

5.1

Alternative Specifications

We now consider two alternative investment specifications. First, we allow for richer dynamics in the investment process by including a lagged dependent variable in the regression
equation. Second, we allow the response of investment to both the fundamentals and the
user cost of capital to differ across sectors. In both alternatives, we confine our attention
to investment equations that include the marginal product of capital and the user cost as
explanatory variables.
Table 5 reports coefficient estimates of the forward mean-differenced dynamic specification given in equation 4. As expected, the inclusion of the lagged investment rate
tends to reduce somewhat the coefficient estimates for both the user cost and the marginal
product of capital. The two coefficients, however, are still economically important and
highly statistically significant in all specifications. Moreover, taking account of investment
dynamics—that is, dividing the coefficients on the user cost and the marginal product of
capital by (1 − α)—actually implies a greater sensitivity of investment to both the user cost
and fundamentals compared with the static case. Consistent with our benchmark results,
the estimated long-run elasticity of capital with respect to the user cost is again close to
unity.
Results in Table 6 are based the specification that allows the coefficient on the marginal
product of capital and the user cost to vary across sectors based on 2-digit NAICS.9 For
the sake of brevity, we report results for the log-log specification only, using MPKΠ as our
measure of investment fundamentals. According to the entries in the table, the elasticity of
investment to the user cost of capital is negative and statistically significant in all sectors,
except in the information sector.10 Thus, our finding that an increase in the user cost has
a strong negative impact on investment spending is broad-based and is not driven by a
small number of observations or data from a single sector. By far, the two largest sectors
in our sample—both in terms of number of firms and percentage of economic activity—
are the nondurable and durable goods manufacturing.11 For these two sectors, our results
9
Because of a small number of service firms in our panel, our definition of the service sector includes
the following 2-digit NAICS sectors: Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (54); Administrative
and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services (56); Healthcare and Social Assistance (62);
Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation (71); Accommodation and Food Services (72); and Other Services,
except Public Administration (81).
10
The information sector (NAICS 2-digit code 51) does not include the information technology (IT) industries, which fall into durable goods manufacturing. The information sector includes the following sub-sectors:
Publishing Industries, except Internet; Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries; Broadcasting, except Internet; Telecommunications; Internet Service Providers; and Other Information Services.
11
The 434 manufacturing firms account for 51 percent of real capital expenditures and 60 percent of real
sales during our sample period.

imply long-run elasticities that are again close to unity. Relative to the two manufacturing
sectors, the coefficient estimate on the user cost in the information sector is estimated with
a substantial degree of imprecision. We suspect that the positive coefficient, as well as the
imprecision of the estimate, reflect the difficulty of distinguishing capital goods prices from
industry-level output prices in this sector.
Thus far, our results imply a significant effect of the user cost of capital on investment
spending in both the short and the long run. According to our benchmark estimates, a
1 percentage point increase in the user cost leads to a decline in the rate of investment

spending of 50 to 75 basis points. Because the after-tax interest rate is, on average, about
two-thirds of the user cost, our estimates imply that a 1 percentage point increase in the
real long-term interest rate induces a reduction in the rate of investment of 30 to 50 basis
points in the short run. The elasticity of capital with respect to the user cost is equal to
unity in the long run.

6

Endogeneity of Interest Rates

An important concern when estimating equation 4 is the potential endogeneity—reflecting
both macroeconomic and firm-specific factors—between investment and the firm-specific
interest rate used to construct the user cost of capital. The endogeneity at the macroeconomic level arises because long-term interest rates and the price of new investment goods
typically fall during economic downturns when investment fundamentals are weak. If our
proxies for investment fundamentals are subject to measurement error, the residual in the
investment regression will capture the omitted factors—in this case, the residual is likely
to be negatively correlated with the user cost. Macroeconomic considerations thus suggest
that endogeneity between prices and quantities leads to a downward bias in the estimate of
21

the elasticity of investment demand with respect to the user cost of capital. Using firm-level
data, however, allows us to control for such biases by including time dummies to capture
these macroeconomic co-movements.
The endogeneity at the firm level arises because variation in interest rates is due in
part to the endogenous decisions made by firms when jointly determining their investment
and financial policies. Such endogeneity leads to two types of biases. First, there is the
potential for omitted variable bias owing to mismeasured fundamentals. Improvements
in fundamentals are likely to increase investment, reduce the likelihood of future default,
and, therefore, raise the price of the firm’s outstanding bonds. Thus, with mismeasured
fundamentals, corporate yields may fall while investment spending rises, a reflection of the
endogenous response of interest rates and investment to unobservables. The presence of
such endogeneity would imply an upward bias in the sensitivity of investment demand to
the user cost of capital. Second, an increase in investment—everything else equal—may
lead to higher leverage if firms finance a portion of their capital expenditures with external
funds. The increased leverage would raise the likelihood of default, causing an increase
in the yield on outstanding corporate debt. This bias, in contrast, would result in the
estimated sensitivity of investment demand to the user cost of capital to be biased toward
zero. In both cases, however, the endogenous response of interest rates is fully reflected in
changes to the expected default risk.
In this section, we address this endogeneity issue in two specific ways. First, we construct
an instrument for the cost of capital that is arguably exogenous to the firm’s financial
policy—that is, we compute the variation in interest rates that is orthogonal to the expected
default risk and therefore exogenous to the firm’s financial policy. Second, in order to control
for omitted variable bias, we include additional explanatory variables in the investment
regression.

6.1

Investment and Default Risk

Our measure of the probability that a firm will default within a certain period of time
comes from the Moody’s/KMV Corporation (MKMV). The theoretical underpinnings for
these probabilities of default are provided by the seminal work of Merton [1973, 1974].
According to this option-theoretic approach, the probability that a firm will default on
its debt obligations at any point in the future is determined by three major factors: the
market value of the firm’s assets, the standard deviation of the stochastic process for the
market value of assets (i.e., asset volatility), and the firm’s leverage. These three factors
are combined into a single measure of default risk called distance to default.
In theory, the default point should equal the book value of total liabilities, implying that
the distance to default compares the net worth of the firm with the size of a one-standard22

deviation move in the firm’s asset value.12 The market value of assets and the volatility
of assets, however, are not directly observable, so they have to be computed in order to
calculate the distance to default. Assuming that the firm’s assets are traded, the market
value of the firm’s equity can be viewed as a call option on the firm’s assets with the strike
price equal to the current book value of the firm’s total debt.13 Using this insight, MKMV
“backs out” the market value and the volatility of assets from a proprietary variant of the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, employing the observed book value of liabilities
and the market value of equity as inputs; see Crosbie and Bohn [2003] for details.
In the final step, MKMV transforms the distance to default into an expected probability
of default—the so-called expected default frequency (EDF)—using an empirical distribution
of actual defaults. Specifically, MKMV estimates a mapping relating the likelihood of
default over a particular horizon to various levels of distance to default, employing an
extensive proprietary database of historical defaults and bankruptcies in the United States.14
These EDFs are calculated monthly and in our case measure the probability that a firm
will default on its debt obligations over the subsequent 12 months. We used EDFs as of the
last month of the firm’s fiscal year when merging MKMV data to the annual Compustat
data files. Because they are based primarily on equity valuations, EDF-based measures of
default risk react rapidly to deterioration in the firm’s credit quality and promptly reflect
changes in aggregate economic conditions.
Using the information on firm-specific probabilities of default, we propose a methodology
that identifies variation in firm-specific interest rates, and hence in the user cost of capital,
that is orthogonal to default risk as well as macroeconomic risk factors that influence the
price of such risk. According to standard asset pricing theory, the spread of corporate
yields over yields on comparable maturity risk-free bonds—the credit spread—measures
the compensation that holders of corporate bonds demand for the expected cost of default,
which equals the expected default probability times the recovery rate (i.e., EDF × R).
However, as pointed out by Elton, Gruber, Agrawal, and Mann [2001] and Huang and Huang
[2003], the actual corporate credit spreads are considerably wider than can be explained
by observed probabilities of default and historical recovery rates on the defaulted bonds.15
12

Empirically, however, MKMV has found that most defaults occur when the market value of the firm’s
assets drops to the value equal to the sum of the firm’s current liabilities and one-half of long-term liabilities
(i.e., Default Point = Current Liabilities + 0.5 × Long-Term Liabilities), and the default point is calibrated
accordingly.
13
The assumption that all of the firm’s assets are traded is clearly inappropriate in most cases. Nevertheless, as shown by Ericsson and Reneby [2004], this approach is still valid provided that at least one of the
firm’s securities (e.g., equity) is traded.
14
The MKMV’s mapping of distances to default to EDFs restricts the probability estimates to the range
between 0.02 percent and 20 percent because of sparse data beyond these points. We omitted observations
with EDFs at the boundary from our analysis.
15
According to these studies, other most important constituents of credit spreads are tax and liquidity
premiums. Relatedly, Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin [2001] show that changes in credit spreads are

Notes: This figure depicts the time-series of the cross-sectional average credit spread—the solid
line—and the cross-sectional average of the year-ahead expected default frequency (EDF)—dotted
line—for the firms in our sample. The shaded vertical bars denote the NBER-dated recessions.

Indeed, this feature can be seen in Figure 3, which depicts the evolution of the average
year-ahead EDF and the average credit spreads for the firms in our sample. Although this
measure of expected default risk is, in general, highly correlated with the corporate credit
spreads, during economic downturns or periods of heightened volatility in financial markets,
spreads tend to increase considerably more than the likelihood of default.
To compute the variation in interest rates that is orthogonal to the expected default risk
and therefore exogenous to the firm’s financial policy, we follow Berndt, Douglas, Duffie,
Ferguson, and Schranz [2005] and estimate a log-log specification of the form:
ln(rjtm − ytm ) = cjtm + θ ln EDFjtm + Rjtm + ftm + ujtm ,

(6)

where rjtm denotes the portfolio yield on the firm j’s outstanding bonds in month tm , ytm is
the average yield on the Treasury securities of the same maturity, and EDFjtm denotes the
year-ahead expected default frequency for firm j, measured at the beginning of the month
tm . To control for differences in recovery rates Rjtm and macro risk factors ftm , we include
a full set of industry (3/4-digit NAICS) and time dummies in the regression equation 6.16
influenced significantly by movements in macro risk factors and a time-varying liquidity premium.
16
We also considered adding higher-order polynomial terms of ln EDFjtm to the right-hand side of the

24

We also augment our option-theoretic measures of expected default risk in equation 6
with default information from external ratings agencies. Because they are based mainly
on movements in equity valuations, the EDFs incorporate high-frequency information regarding default risk. By contrast, external ratings of firms’ senior unsecured debt contain
low-frequency information that reflects a variety of firm and industry-specific factors not
captured by the distance to default. In addition, credit ratings are based on a borrower’s
ability to meet its debt obligations in the event of an economic downturn and therefore contain information about the likelihood of default over a longer horizon (e.g., Löffler [2007]).
Specifically, letting n = 1, 2, . . . , N index the N distinct credit ratings (i.e., AAA, AA, A,
etc.), we incorporate this additional information about the firm-specific likelihood of default by adding to the set of regressors a full set of dummy variables that measure the firm’s
rating of its senior unsecured debt. We do so by specifying that the firm-specific term cjtm
in equation 6 satisfies:
cjtm =

N
X

γn 1(Bjtm = n),

n=1

where 1(Bjtm = n) is the indicator function for firm j’s credit rating Bjtm and the beginning
of month tm . The parameter γn , therefore, provides an estimate of the average credit spread
for rating category n = 1, 2, . . . , N in month tm , conditional on expected default.
The residual from the regression equation 6, ujtm , is our measure of a firm-specific
liquidity premium.17 The key requirement for ujtm to be a valid instrument for the firmspecific user cost in the investment equation 5 is that these liquidity shocks are not correlated
with the firm’s investment opportunities. Note that ujtm is, by construction, orthogonal
to the expected default risk as measured by both the EDF and the firm’s external credit
rating. By employing as an instrument a variable that is orthogonal to the main source
of potential endogeneity considered in the asset pricing literature—namely default risk—it
seems quite reasonable to assume that these liquidity shocks are not determined by the
firm’s investment opportunities and, consequently, can be used to address the endogeneity
between investment demand and the user cost of capital.
Because our investment data are on an annual basis, we construct our instrument—
regression equation 6, because the relationship between corporate spreads and default risk, even in a log-log
specification, may not be linear. However, the influence of these higher-order terms on the relationship
between credit spreads and default risk was negligible, and all of our results were completely robust to this
alternative specification.
17
Berndt et al. [2005] use credit-default swap (CDS) data to determine the price of default risk by regressing
the CDS spread on MKMV’s expected default frequency. Blanco, Brennan, and Marsh [2005] argue that
corporate bond prices suffer from liquidity premia owing to the limited supply of each firm’s bonds at
different maturities. Because credit-default swaps are derivatives, they are less likely to suffer from liquidity
premia when traded in the secondary market. Indeed, Blanco et al. [2005] and use the gap between the
bond price and the credit default swap—the so-called basis—as their measure of a liquidity premium, an
approach consistent with our proposed methodology.

25

that is, the average annual liquidity shock—as ûjt =

P12

m=1 ûjtm .

These instruments are

constructed to match each firm’s fiscal year and thus reflect information within the fiscal
year about fluctuations in firm-specific interest rates. As a result, they are correlated with
K
the user cost of capital Cjt
and, according to our argument, uncorrelated with ǫjt , the

unobservable component of the investment demand equation. They may, therefore, be
used as valid instruments to estimate the forward mean-differenced regression specified in
K
equation 4. Formally, we are replacing the orthogonality condition E[ǫjt Cj,t−k
| µj , λt ] = 0

with the orthogonality condition E[ǫjt ûj,t−k | µj , λt ] = 0, for k ≥ 0, which implies that
current (and lagged) values of our liquidity shock ûjt are valid instruments for the forward
T

mean-differenced error term ∆t j (ǫjt ). Because the MKMV data are only available from
January 1991 onwards, our results are based on the 1991–2005 sub-period. We first report
estimates of the yield spread regression 6. Then we re-estimate the dynamic specification
reported in Table 5 for the 1991–2005 period using liquidity shocks as instruments.
Table 7 reports the regression results from estimating the yield spread equation 6. We
consider four separate specifications. The first specification only includes the log of the
expected default frequency. We then augment this baseline specification sequentially with
industry fixed effects, time fixed effects, and credit-rating variables. As noted in the first
column, the EDF term alone yields an R2 of 0.483, a goodness-of-fit similar to that reported by Berndt et al. [2005] who used credit default swap spreads in place of spreads
on outstanding corporate bonds. Although industry fixed effects do not appear to have a
large impact, the addition of the time dummies—included to capture variation in macro
risk factors—significantly improves the fit of the regression and implies a modest reduction
in the coefficient on the EDF. Finally, the inclusion of credit-rating dummies substantially
reduces the effect of the expected default frequency and significantly raises the explanatory power of the regression. With all four factors included, the regression explains almost
76 percent of the monthly variation in the corporate credit spreads.
Figure 4 displays the impact of the credit-rating indicators on yield spreads from specification 4 in Table 7.18 As expected, these estimates imply a strong negative relationship
between external credit ratings and corporate yield spreads. Our estimates imply a differential in yield spreads between C-rated and AAA-rated firms of more than 200 basis points,
on average, with most of this difference occurring between the CCC1 and AA3 rating categories.
We now consider the effect of instrumenting the user cost of capital with our estimates of
18

Because the dependent variable is in logs, the impact of the credit rating n on the level of yield spreads
is given by exp (γ̂n − V (γ̂n )) − 1, where γ̂n is the estimated coefficient on a dummy variable associated with
rating n and V (γ̂n ) is the estimated variance of γ̂n (cf., Kennedy [1981]. In addition, we restricted the sum
of coefficients on each set of dummy variables (i.e., industry, time, and credit rating) to sum to zero. The
estimated coefficients in Figure 4 thus measure the effect of each credit rating relative to the average rating
effect.

liquidity shocks. We focus on the dynamic specification that uses forward mean-differencing
to eliminate the firm fixed effect µj . The forward mean-differencing allows us to instrument
the user cost without imposing the additional assumption that the current error term in
the investment equation is orthogonal to future information that may be reflected in the
bond market through liquidity shocks. Table 8 reports results for this dynamic specification
estimated over the 1991–2005 sample period.
Remarkably, using the liquidity shock as an instrument causes the coefficient on the user
cost to increase in magnitude for three out of the four specifications reported in Table 8.
The coefficient is essentially unchanged for the log-log specification that uses MPKΠjt to
measure the marginal product of capital. Although differences in the estimates reported
in Tables 5 and 8 are not statistically significant, our instrumental variable results imply

that our benchmark estimates of the user-cost effect are unlikely to be biased to the upside
because of the endogeneity between interest rates and the firm’s financial policy. The higher
estimated coefficient on the user cost also reduces somewhat our estimate of the long-run
elasticity of capital. In none of these cases, however, can we reject the hypothesis that the
long-run elasticity of capital with respect to the user cost is unity.

6.2

Investment, the Cost of Capital, and Other Factors

An alternative to the instrumental variables approach discussed above is to include additional explanatory variables—which capture the potentially omitted information—in the
regression. The variables we consider are Tobin’s Q and expected default risk as measured
by EDFs. Because both Tobin’s Q and EDFs are based on stock market data, they are
forward-looking variables and, consequently, may contain information about future investment opportunities not captured by our current measures of the marginal product of capital.
Thus, including Tobin’s Q and EDFs in the regression provides another way to address the
potential endogeneity between interest rates, investment opportunities, and financial policy
that motivated our original instrumental variables procedure.
Because the investment data are annual, we augment the regression with the EDF
and Tobin’s Q constructed using the information as of the beginning of the period; the

EDF thus measures the likelihood of default over the coming year. This contrasts with
our instrumental variables procedure, which allowed us to exploit the relationship between
credit spreads and expected default risk at a monthly frequency, thus yielding an instrument
that was constructed using information in the fiscal year in which the investment was
made. Because the two approaches rely on a different information structure, each should
be informative regarding potential biases in our regression analysis.19

Recall that when using liquidity shocks as instruments, we restricted our analysis to the forward meandifferenced specification to ensure that our instrument was truly orthogonal to the transformed error term,

In the regression that includes Tobin’s Q, we consider two alternative ways to measure Q.
given that liquidity shocks use contemporaneous information. In the augmented regression, by contrast,
we use beginning-of-period values of Tobin’s Q and the EDF, and we are, therefore, less concerned about

30

The first measure—denoted by QAVG —uses the sum of the market value of the firm’s equity
and the book value of its debt, divided by the replacement value of capital. The numerator in
the second measure—denoted by QKMV —is equal to the market value of the firm calculated
by MKMV using the Merton model discussed above. To our knowledge, we are first to use
this measure of Tobin’s Q in an investment regression.20
Estimation results from this exercise are reported in Table 9. Because EDFs are only
available from January 1991 onwards, we again restrict our attention to the 1991–2005
period. The top panel of the table reports estimates using the semi-log specification, whereas
the bottom panel reports estimates using the log-log specification. According to the entries
in the table, Tobin’s Q adds explanatory power to the regression, with point estimates that
are highly statistically significant and of the magnitude consistent with previous studies.
Importantly, the addition of the Tobin’s Q to the regression has very little effect on the
parameter estimates associated with the user cost and the marginal product of capital,
regardless of the measure of Tobin’s Q used.
The expected default frequency also adds explanatory power to the investment regression. The coefficient on the EDF is statistically significant but economically unimportant—
given an average default rate of 1 percent and an average investment rate of 18 percent, a
1 percentage point increase in expected default implies a reduction in the rate of investment
of just 2 basis points. Whereas the beginning-of-period expected default risk does provide
independent information relative to the user cost, the parameter estimate on the user cost
is unaffected by the inclusion of the EDF variable. The results in Table 9 thus provide
further evidence against the possibility that our benchmark estimates of the user-cost effect
are biased, owing to either omitted variable bias or endogeneity issues related to the joint
determination of the firm’s investment and financial policy.

Conclusion

In this paper, we employed a newly constructed data set linking firm-specific bond prices
and default probabilities to balance sheet and income statement data in order to study the
effect of variation in interest rates on investment spending. The bond price data, based on
bias arising from contemporaneous correlation. Our results, however, are unchanged if we use a forward
mean-differenced transformation and/or allow for a lagged dependent variable.
20
Given the theoretical and empirical attention lavished on investment-Q regressions, it is also of independent interest to determine whether Q has explanatory power for investment once one controls for the user
cost, or, put differently, whether the user cost matters, conditional on Q. From a theoretical perspective,
asset markets, under constant returns to scale, should fully price the effect of firm-specific interest rates on
investment. Thus, the user cost should matter only to the extent that it serves as a tax-adjustment for Q.
The primary source of cross-sectional heterogeneity in our measure of the user cost comes from interest
rates, as variation in the tax term is not firm specific. Including both the user cost and Tobin’s Q, therefore,

trades in the secondary market, allowed us to use a firm-specific measure of the marginal
cost of external finance to construct the user cost of capital. In contrast to a large number
of previous studies that have documented little, if any, systematic relationship between
the cost of capital and investment spending, our results imply a robust and quantitatively
important effect of the user cost on investment at the firm level. According to our benchmark
estimates, a 1 percentage point increase in the user cost of capital implies a reduction in
the rate of investment of 50 to 75 basis points and, in the long run, a 1 percent reduction
in the stock of capital.
Given the substantial variation in financing costs observed both over time and across
firms, our results bring renewed interest to questions regarding the determination of capital
costs and their effect on investment spending. In particular, our results suggest that, in
the absence of countervailing forces, the sharp widening in corporate yield spreads and the
associated rise in default risk experienced by the corporate sector during 2001–02 period
likely exerted a significant drag on investment spending during the most recent economic
downturn.

Components of the User Cost of Capital

This appendix describe the construction of the industry-specific components of the user
cost of capital. Unless otherwise noted, the underlying industry-level data come from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and are available at the annual frequency from 1987 to
2005. Following the BEA, our industry classification encompasses 52 industries based on the
3-digit (in some cases 4-digit) North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS).
Price of New Investment, Capital, and Output: The annual data on the price of
new investment and the price of existing capital stock come from the BEA’s Detailed Fixed
Assets Tables. Using the chain-type quantity indexes and the historical-cost investment in,
and holdings of, private fixed assets—that is, equipment and software, and structures—we

by-Industry Accounts. The base year for all indexes in 2000. Because firms in our sample
have fiscal years ending in different months of the year, we interpolated the annual price
indexes to monthly frequency using cubic splines.21 The resulting industry-level monthly
price indexes were averaged over the 12 relevant months of each firm’s fiscal year and merged
with the annual firm-level data.
To construct expected capital gains (or losses) stemming from the firm’s purchase of

We experimented with a number of other adaptive schemes to create a proxy for expected
capital gains—including setting it equal to zero—and all of our results were robust to these
alternative assumptions.
Depreciation: To construct depreciation rates, we used annual estimates of net stocks
and depreciation by NAICS industry for private nonresidential fixed assets available in
the Detailed Fixed Assets Tables. The time-varying depreciation rate for industry s was
constructed as
Dst
,
δst =
Ks,t−1
21

See, for example, de Boor [1981]. We also took logs of all industry-level series prior to the interpolation;
the logs of price indexes at the monthly frequency were then exponentiated to obtain monthly levels of price
indexes at the industry level.

36

where Dst is the real dollar value of depreciation of private fixed assets in industry s during
year t and Ks,t−1 is the real stock of capital in industry s at the end of year t − 1. As
with the price indexes, we interpolated the annual industry-specific depreciation rates to
monthly frequency using cubic splines, and the resulting monthly data were then averaged
over the 12 relevant months of each firm’s fiscal year and merged with the annual firm-level
data.22
Tax Considerations: Our source of the tax-related data is the Federal Reserve’s FRB/US
quarterly macroeconometric model of the U.S. economy. The FRB/US model separates
business fixed investment into three categories of investment spending: high-tech equipment, other business equipment, and business structures. For each of these investment categories, the FRB/US model contains a detailed modeling of the tax code for depreciation
allowances, tax service lives, and investment tax credits. Our sample period (1987–2005),
however, is marked by a relatively stable corporate tax environment. For example, the
marginal tax rate on corporate profits (τt ), which we assume to be common across firms,
was 34 percent between 1987:Q1 and 1992:Q4 and 35 percent for the remainder of our sample period. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the investment tax credit on most assets
(the ITC term in the user cost formula) and, with the exception of the Job Creation and
Worker Assistance Act of 2002, the patterns of depreciation used to calculate the present
discounted (PDV) value of depreciation deductions are relatively straightforward.
To construct the PDV of depreciation allowances (zt ) at the industry level, we combined
the BEA’s investment data with the FRB/US tax-related series. Specifically, the FRB/US
model contains expressions for the PDV of depreciation allowances for high-tech equipment
(ztHT ), other business equipment (ztOTH ), and nonresidential structures (ztNRS ), based on continuous time formulas for allowable depreciation methods. Specifically, letting L denote a
lifetime of the asset for tax purposes, then the PDV of deductions for a one dollar purchase
is given by

where B is the declining balance used in the accelerated depreciation method (e.g., in
case of a double declining balance pattern B = 2), i is the nominal interest rate, and
0 < l∗ < L is the optimal switchover time from the accelerated depreciation to the straightline method.23 We set the nominal interest rate i equal to 7 percent when calculating the
PDV of depreciation allowances. The expressions in the FRB/US also take into account
temporary increases in depreciation allowances for spending on equipment and software
(E&S) that were passed in 2002 and 2003.24
22
Prior to the interpolation, we applied the logit transformation to annual depreciation rates, and the
resulting interpolated series were then transformed back using the inverse logit transformation. This transformation of the data ensured that the interpolated monthly depreciation rates remained in the (0, 1) interval.
23
Under accelerated depreciation, firms can never deduct the full nominal value of their purchase, so the
tax code allows a switch to the straight-line method to complete the depreciation write-off. For high-tech and
other business equipment categories of investment spending, these formulas take into account the optimal
switchover point from accelerated depreciation methods to the straight line pattern of depreciation—for
nonresidential structures, by contrast, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 stipulates only the straight-line method.

The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 included a temporary increase in depreciation

In the next step, we interpolated our estimates of ztHT , ztOTH , and ztNRS from quarterly to
monthly frequency using cubic splines.25 From the BEA’s Detailed Fixed Assets Tables, we
then calculated annual (nominal) investment expenditures for the corresponding investment
categories—denoted by ItHT , ItOTH , and ItNRS , respectively—and interpolated them to monthly
frequency using the same methodology as in the case of price indexes. We then constructed
the present value of depreciation allowances for investment in E&S as

As in the case of depreciation rates, we used the logit and inverse logit transformations to ensure that
the interpolated series remained in the (0, 1) range.

• Operating Income: Operating income (or loss) in year t (x13 ) was deflated by the

• Tobin’s Q: The average Q was defined as the ratio of the sum of the market value of
common shares outstanding and the book value of total liabilities at the end of year
t (x25 × x199 ) to the book value of total assets at the end of year t (x6 ).
The real investment rate [I/K]jt was then defined as the ratio of real investment expenditures in year t relative to the real capital stock at the end of year t − 1; sales to capital
[S/K]jt and operating income to capital [Π/K]jt ratios were similarly scaled by the real
capital stock at the end of year t − 1. To ensure that our results were not influenced by
a small number of extreme observations, we dropped from our panel all observations that
failed to satisfy any of the following four criteria:
1. 0.01 ≤ [I/K]jt ≤ 1.00;
2. 0.00 < [S/K]jt ≤ 25.0;
3. −0.50 ≤ [Π/K]jt ≤ 3.00;
VG
4. 0.00 < QA
jt ≤ 40.0.

To construct the industry-specific scaling constants φs and ψs used to calculate our
estimates of the marginal product of capital, we constructed a panel of all nonfarm, nonfinancial firms in Compustat during the 1987–2005 period and from which we eliminated
all extreme observations using the same four selection criteria as above. Recall that the
scaling constants φs and ψs are intended to account for the fact that the sales-to-capital and
operating-income-to-capital ratios vary substantially across industries, whereas in equilibrium, the return on capital should be the same across industries. To capture this intuition,
we let

where M is the number of firms in our panel,
P Ns is the number of nonfarm, nonfinancial
Compustat firms in industry s, and T = j Tj denotes the time-series dimension of each
panel.
The first term in both expressions is simply the sample average—across firms and years—
of the user cost of capital, calculated using our panel of 898 firms over the 1987–2005
period. The second terms correspond to the sample averages of the sales-to-capital and
operating-income-to-capital ratios for industry s, respectively, calculated using the panel of
all nonfarm, nonfinancial firms in Compustat over the same period. Thus, the industryspecific scaling factors φs and ψs are defined so that the sales-to-capital and operatingincome-to-capital ratios of different industries are, on average, equal to the average rate
of return on capital—as measured by our estimate of the user cost—over the 1987–2005
period.
