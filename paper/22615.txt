Real-Time Forecast Evaluation of DSGE Models with Stochastic Volatility
Francis X. Diebold, Frank Schorfheide, and Minchul Shin
NBER Working Paper No. 22615
September 2016
JEL No. E17
ABSTRACT
Recent work has analyzed the forecasting performance of standard dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium (DSGE) models, but little attention has been given to DSGE models that incorporate
nonlinearities in exogenous driving processes. Against that background, we explore whether
incorporating stochastic volatility improves DSGE forecasts (point, interval, and density). We
examine real-time forecast accuracy for key macroeconomic variables including output growth,
inflation, and the policy rate. We find that incorporating stochastic volatility in DSGE models of
macroeconomic fundamentals markedly improves their density forecasts, just as incorporating
stochastic volatility in models of financial asset returns improves their density forecasts.

Introduction

Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models are now used widely for forecasting. Recently, several studies have shown that standard linearized DSGE models compete
successfully with other forecasting models, including linear reduced-form time-series models such as vector autoregressions (VAR’s).1 However, little is known about the predictive
importance of omitted non-linearities.
Recent work by Sims and Zha (2006), Justiniano and Primiceri (2008), Bloom (2009), and
Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2013) has highlighted that time-varying volatility is a key nonlinearity not only in financial data but also in macroeconomic time series.
The empirical findings reported in Justiniano and Primiceri (2008), Fernández-Villaverde
and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2013), and Curdia et al. (2014), who also consider fat-tailed shock
distributions, indicate that the fit of DSGE models can be improved by allowing for stochastic volatility in the exogenous shock processes. Against this background, we examine the
real-time forecast accuracy (point, interval and density) of linearized DSGE models with
and without stochastic volatility. We seek to determine whether and why incorporation of
stochastic volatility is helpful for macroeconomic forecasting.
Several structural studies find that density forecasts from linearized standard DSGE
models are not well-calibrated, but they leave open the issue of whether simple inclusion of
stochastic volatility would fix the problem.2 Simultaneously, reduced-form studies such as
Clark (2011) clearly indicate that inclusion of stochastic volatility in linear models (vector
autoregressions) improves density forecast calibration. Our work in this paper, in contrast,
is structural and yet still incorporates stochastic volatility, effectively asking questions in the
tradition of Clark (2011), but in a structural environment. Our empirical findings are very

and Wolters (2015).

similar to those of Clark (2011): the inclusion of stochastic volatility improves predictions in
terms of coverage probabilities of interval forecasts, predictive likelihood values, and coverage
probabilities of density forecasts.
We proceed as follows. In Section 2 we introduce a benchmark DSGE model, with and
without stochastic volatility. In Section 3 we describe our methods for model solution and
posterior analysis. In Section 4 we introduce our approach for real-time DSGE forecast analysis with vintage data, describing our dataset and procedure, and providing initial stochastic
volatility estimates. In Sections 5, 6 and 7 we evaluate DSGE point, interval and density
forecasts, respectively. We conclude in Section 8. An Online Appendix contains two robustness exercises that involve the evaluation of 90% probability interval forecasts and the
evaluation of forecasts based on a pre-Great Recession sample that ends in 2007:Q4.

A New Keynesian DSGE Model

Here we present the DSGE model that is used in the subsequent empirical analysis. It is
similar to the small-scale New Keynesian model studied by Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013).
The model economy consists of households, firms, a central bank that conducts monetary
policy by setting the nominal interest rate, and a fiscal authority that determines the amount
of government consumption and finances it using lump-sum taxes. In what follows, we
are summarizing the log-linearized equilibrium conditions of this economy. Technology At
evolves according to
log At = (log γ)t + z̃t .

(1)

The first part is a deterministic trend component, whereas the second component is an
exogenous stochastic process which may be stationary or exhibit a stochastic trend. We

2

define the change in the stochastic component as

zt = z̃t − z̃t−1 .

To describe the equilibrium conditions, it is convenient to detrend consumption Ct and
output Yt by the level of technology. The detrended variables are defined as Ct /At and
Yt /At , respectively. Even if z̃t follows a unit-root process, the model has a steady state in
terms of the detrended variables. Henceforth we express all variables in log deviations from
steady state values; for example, ct = log(Ct /At ) − log c∗ , where c∗ is the steady state value
of detrended consumption.
The households determine their supply of labor services to the firms and choose consumption. They receive labor and dividend income as well interest rate payments on nominal
bonds. The consumption Euler equation can be expressed as
1
ct = Et [ct+1 + zt+1 ] − (Rt − Et [πt+1 ]),
τ

(2)

where ct is consumption, Rt is the nominal interest rate, and πt is inflation. The parameter
τ captures the relative degree of risk aversion. The discount factor β of the representative
household does not appear in the log-linearized Euler equation.
The production sector consists of monopolistically competitive intermediate-goods producing firms and perfectly competitive final goods producers. The former hire labor from
the households, produce their goods using a linear technology with productivity At , and sell
their output to the final goods producers. Nominal price rigidities are introduced by assuming that only a fraction of the intermediate-goods producers can re-optimize their prices in
each period (Calvo mechanism). The final goods producers simply combine the intermediate
goods. In equilibrium the inflation in the price of the final good is determined by a New

3

Keynesian Phillips curve:

πt =

ι
β
(1 − ζβ)(1 − ζ)
πt−1 +
Et [πt+1 ] +
(ct + νl yt ),
1 + ιβ
1 + ιβ
(1 + ιβ)ζ

(3)

where ζ is the probability with which price setters are able to re-optimize their prices, ι is
the fraction of price setters that index their price to lagged inflation in the event that they
are unable to re-optimize, and νl is the inverse labor supply elasticity of the households.
We assume that a fraction of output is used for government consumption. The loglinearized resource constraint takes the form

yt = ct + gt ,

(4)

where gt is an exogenously evolving government spending shock. The central bank sets
nominal interest rates in response to inflation and output growth deviations from their
respective targets:



Rt = ρR Rt−1 + (1 − ρR ) (1 − ψ1 )π∗,t + ψ1 πt + ψ2 (yt − yt−1 + zt ) + mt ,

(5)

where mt is a monetary policy shock and π∗,t is a central bank’s inflation target rate in
log-deviation from its long-run mean log(π∗ ).
The target inflation rate evolves as a stationary AR(1) process with a homoscedastic
innovations:
∗
+ π∗ ,t ,
πt∗ = ρπ∗ πt−1

π∗ ,t ∼ N (0, σπ2 ∗ ).

(6)

The parameter ρπ∗ is expected to be close to one so that πt∗ captures low frequency changes
in inflation that we attribute to slowly evolving changes in monetary policy regimes. The
time-varying target rate is empirically supported by US data. It mainly captures the fact

4

that monetary policy was characterized by a shift to a high-inflation period in the 1970s
which ended with Volcker’s stabilization policy. In the forecasting context, the time-varying
target rate captures low frequency shifts in the level of inflation.
We complete the model by specifying laws of motion for the remaining exogenous shock
processes:

mt = R,t ,

2
R,t ∼ N (0, σR,t
),

z̃t = ρz (1 − ϕ)z̃t−1 + ϕz̃t−2 + z,t ,
gt = ρg gt−1 + g,t ,

(7)
2
),
z,t ∼ N (0, σz,t

2
g,t ∼ N (0, σg,t
).

We assume that R,t , z,t , g,t , and π∗ ,t are orthogonal at all leads and lags. In a constantvolatility implementation, we simply take σR,t = σR , σz,t = σz and σg,t = σg . Incorporating stochastic volatility is similarly straightforward. Following Fernández-Villaverde
and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2007), Justiniano and Primiceri (2008), and Fernández-Villaverde and
Rubio-Ramı́rez (2013), we take

σi,t = σi eνi,t ,

νi,t = ρσi νi,t−1 + ηi,t ,

i ∈ {R, z, g}

(8)

where ηi,t and j,t are independent of each other at all leads and lags for all i and j.

3

Model Solution and Posterior Analysis

Ignoring for a moment the stochastic volatilities of the structural shock innovations t =
[R,t , z,t , g,t , π∗ ,t ]0 , Equations (2)-(7) form a linear rational expectations system that can be
solved with a standard algorithm, e.g., Sims (2002). In preliminary work, we also solved the
DSGE model with second-order perturbation techniques. However, except in the vicinity
of the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate, our New Keynesian model – using a
5

parameterization that fits U.S. data – does not generate any strong nonlinearities. Thus,
to simplify the computations, we simply combine the log-linear approximation with the
stochastic volatility processes specified above. This leads to a conditionally (given the three
volatility processes) linear Gaussian state-space model.

3.1

Transition

We present transition equations with constant and stochastic volatility.

3.1.1

Constant Volatility

A first-order perturbation solution results in a linear transition equation for the state variables,
st = Φ1 (θ)st−1 + Φ (θ)t
(9)
t ∼ iidN (0, Q(θ)),
where st = [yt , yt−1 , ct , πt , Rt , mct , mt , gt , zt , πt∗ ]0 is a (non-minimal) vector of state variables,
Φ1 is a ns × ns matrix, Φ is a ns × ne matrix and Q is a ne × ne matrix, where ns is the
number of state variables and ne is the number of structural shocks. The elements of the
coefficient matrices (Φ1 (θ), Φ (θ), Q(θ)) are non-linear functions of θ.
3.1.2

Stochastic Volatility

Linearization is inappropriate with stochastic volatility, as stochastic volatility vanishes under linearization. Instead, at least second-order approximation is required to preserve terms
related to stochastic volatility, as shown by Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2007,
2013). Interestingly, however, Justiniano and Primiceri (2008) suggest a method to approximate the model solution using a partially non-linear function. The resulting law of motion

6

is the same as that of the linearized solution, except that the variance-covariance matrix of
the structural shocks can be time-varying,
st = Φ1 (θ)st−1 + Φ (θ)t
(10)
t ∼ iidN (0, Qt (θ)).
More specifically, Qt (θ) is a diagonal matrix. The first three diagonal elements are σi2 e2νi,t
for i ∈ {R, z, g}. The fourth diagonal element is σπ2 ∗ . The νi,t ’s have their own transition,
νi,t = ρσi νi,t−1 + ηi,t

(11)

ηi,t ∼ iidN (0, σσ2i ).
Together with a measurement equation, (10) and (11) form a partially non-linear state-space
representation. One of the nice features of this formulation is that the system remains linear
and Gaussian, conditional on Qt .

3.2

Measurement

We complete the model with a set of measurement equations that connect state variables
to observable variables. We consider quarter-on-quarter GDP growth rates (Y GR) and
inflation rates (IN F ), quarterly nominal interest (federal funds) rates (F F R), and 10-year
inflation expectation (IN F 10y ) from the Survey of Professional Forecasters maintained by
FRB Philadelphia3 . We measure IN F , F F R, and IN F 10y as annualized percentages, and
we measure YGR as a quarterly percentage. We assume that there is no measurement error.
3

To obtain longer inflation expectation series, we take inflation expectations from the Livingston Survey
and the Blue Chip Economic Indicators for the period 1979–1991 and from the Survey of Professional
Forecasters (SPF) afterwards. Inflation expectations in this survey are for the CPI, while inflation rates
in our estimation and prediction are for the GDP deflator. To correct for this difference, we subtract the
average difference between CPI and GDP inflation from the beginning of the sample to the initial point for
our forecasting exercise. See Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013) for details.

(12)

We link the observed 10-year inflation expectation to the model-implied 10-year inflation
expectation in the last line. Our 10-year inflation expectations data start in 1979. Prior to
this date, we treat the expectations data as missing and adjust the measurement equation
accordingly. As discussed in Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013), the expectations data help to
identify the time-varying target rate πt∗ in real time and ensure that the post-1992 inflation
forecasts are not contaminated by reversion to a mean that reflects the high inflation rates
in the 1970s.
In slight abuse of notation (changing the definition of Y ) we write the measurement
equation as
Yt = Dt (θ) + Zt (θ)st .

(13)

Here Yt is now the nt × 1 vector of observed variables (composed of Y GRt , IN Ft , F F Rt ,
and IN Ft10y ), Dt (θ) is an nt × 1 vector that contains the DSGE model-implied mean of the
observables, Zt (θ) is an nt × ns matrix that relates the observables to the model states, and
st is the ns × 1 state vector. The dimension of the measurement equation deterministically
changes over time depending on the availability of the 10-year expectation data.

3.3

Estimation

We perform inference and prediction using the Random Walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm
with the Kalman filter, as facilitated by the linear-Gaussian structure of our state-space

8

system, conditional on Qt . In particular, we use the Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm
developed by Kim et al. (1998) and adapted by Justiniano and Primiceri (2008) to the
estimation of linearized DSGE models with stochastic volatility.4

Detailed descriptions of the posterior simulator can be found in Justiniano and Primiceri (2008), Del Negro and Schorfheide (2011), and Del Negro and Primiceri (2015).

the main text. We fix ρz = 1.

10

Implementing Bayesian techniques requires the specification of a prior distribution. We
use priors consistent with those of Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013) for parameters that we
have in common and summarize them in Table 1. We fix ρz = 1, imposing a unit root in
technology. For the model with stochastic volatility, we consider two specifications. The first
specification follows Justiniano and Primiceri (2008) and assumes that log volatility evolves
as random walk
SV-RW :

νi,t = νi,t−1 + ηi,t ,

ηi,t ∼ N (0, σσ2i ),

(14)

where we set the autoregressive parameter to one, ρσi = 1. For this specification, we impose
the inverse gamma prior on σσ2i :
σσ2i ∼ IG(2, 0.0001).

(15)

This prior specification implies that with 90% probability the standard deviation of a structural shocks can be 18% smaller or 22% larger at the end of the sample in 2011:Q1 compared
to its initial level in 1964:Q2.
The second volatility specification relaxes the random walk assumption and assumes the
following AR(1) log volatility process:

SV-AR :

νi,t = cσi + ρσi νi,t−1 + ηi,t ,

ηi,t ∼ N (0, σσ2i ).

(16)

Here we reparameterized the volatility process in terms of cσi = (1 − ρσi ) log σi . For this
specification, we use the following prior distributions:

cσi ∼ N (0, 10),

ρσi ∼ N (0.9, 0.07),

σσ2i ∼ IG(2, 0.05).

We constrain the priors for the AR(1) stochastic-volatility coefficients to be in the stationary

11

region, ρσi ∈ (−1, 1). This specification is less restrictive than the first one in terms of the a
priori likely volatility range. The prior implies that standard deviations of structural shocks
can be 50% smaller or 100% larger with 90% chance at any given point in time.
Finally, we also consider a specification with a deterministic break in the standard deviation of the structural shocks. We simply assume that structural break happened during
the Great Moderation at the end of 1984:

DV-SB :

σi,t =




σ

i,0



σi,1

if t ≤ 1984 : Q4
(17)
if t > 1984 : Q4,

where we estimate σi,0 and σi,1 separately. We impose the same inverse Gamma prior distribution for σi,0 and σi,1 with the same parameter values as in the model with constant
volatility.

3.4

Prediction

We focus on the DSGE model with stochastic volatility. Let νt = [νR,t , νg,t , νz,t ]0 . We generate
draws from the posterior predictive density using the decomposition,

p(YT +1:T +H |Y1:T )
Z
Z
=
(θ,sT ,νT )

(18)

×p(θ, sT , νT |Y1:T )d(θ, sT , νT ).

We use the subscript t1 : t2 to indicate sequences from t1 to t2 , e.g., Y1:T is shorthand for
Y1 , . . . , YT . The decomposition shows how the predictive density reflects uncertainty about
parameters and states at the forecast origin, p(θ, sT , νT |Y1:T ), and uncertainty about future
12

states. Motivated by this decomposition, we generate draws from the predictive density,
adapting the algorithm of Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013) to account for the hidden
volatility process νt .

posterior distribution p(θ, sT , νT |Y1:T ). We discard the first 10,000 draws and select every
10th draw to get 1, 000 draws of parameters and initial states. For each of these draws, we
execute Steps 2 and 3 of the algorithm 10 times, which produces a total of nsim = 20, 000
draws from the predictive distribution.

Real-Time DSGE Forecast Analysis with Vintage
Data

4.1

Empirical Procedure

We evaluate DSGE forecasts using the real-time data set constructed by Del Negro and
Schorfheide (2013), who built data vintages aligned with the publication dates of the Blue
Chip survey and the Federal Reserve Board’s Greenbook, extending the data set compiled
by Edge and Gürkaynak (2010). In this paper we use the Del Negro-Schorfheide data set
matched to the Blue Chip survey publication dates. The survey is conducted over two days,
typically beginning on the first or second business day of each month, and then published a
few days later. We consider the April, July, October, and January publication dates. The
timing of the survey implies that, say, the April 2005 forecast utilizes the “third” estimate
of GDP for the fourth quarter of 2004, but not the advance estimate for the first quarter of
2005.
Our first forecast origin is January 1992, and our last forecast origin for one-step-ahead
forecasts is April 2011. We recursively estimate the DSGE models for the resulting 78
vintages. The estimation sample starts in 1964:Q2 for all vintages. For example, for the
January 1992 vintage we estimate DSGE models based on the sample 1964:Q2 - 1991:Q3

14

and generate forecasts for 1991:Q4 (one step ahead) through 1993:Q2 (eight steps ahead).5
We then expand the sample gradually, eventually incorporating all vintages from January
1992 through April 2011, implying that the last observation in the estimation sample is
dated 2010:Q4. We compute forecast errors based on actuals from the most recent vintage,
which best estimates the “truth.”6 The last observation that we forecast is 2011:Q1. As
a robustness check we present forecast evaluation statistics based on samples ending in
2007:Q4, excluding data from the Great Recession. The key findings are very similar to
those presented subsequently for the longer sample.

4.2

On the Use of Vintage Data

From a model-selection perspective, one might ask whether a full-sample analysis with finalrevised data, as opposed to an expanding-sample analysis with real-time vintage data, would
be more informative. For our purposes in this paper the answer is clearly no, because our
interest is intrinsically centered on real-time performance, which is an expanding-sample
phenomenon involving vintage data. That is, each period we get not only a new observation,
but also an improved estimate of the entire history of all observations. Analysis based on
final-revised data, even pseudo-real-time analysis based on an expanding sample, is simply
not relevant.7
Let us consider real-time vintage data issues from a more formal Bayesian viewpoint
centered on predictive likelihood in its relation to marginal likelihood. By Bayes’ theorem
5

At the end of December 1991 the 1991:Q4 NIPA data were not yet available.
Alternatively, we could have used actuals from the first “final” data release, which for output corresponds
to the “Final” NIPA estimate (available roughly three months after the quarter is over). Del Negro and
Schorfheide (2013) found that conclusions regarding DSGE model forecasting performance are generally not
affected by the choice of actuals, as did Rubaszek and Skrzypczyński (2008).

The Estimated Volatility Paths

Our hope, explored subsequently, is that stochastic-volatility DSGE models will produce
better forecasts – particularly better interval and density forecasts – than their fixed-volatility
counterparts. A necessary condition is that volatility actually be stochastic and indeed
highly-variable. Hence we begin by examining and comparing estimated structural shock
variances from constant-volatility and stochastic-volatility DSGE models.
In Figure 1 we report posterior-mean stochastic-volatility estimates for the SV-AR specification (solid lines), constant-volatility estimates (dashed black lines), and estimates based
on the structural-break specification DV-SV (solid grey lines) obtained from three different
real-time data vintages. The vintages are those of January 1992, October 2002, and April
16

2011, and the corresponding samples end in 1991:Q3, 2002:Q2, and 2010:Q4. The general
shapes of volatility are very similar across vintages.
Overall, the estimates confirm significant time variation in volatility. In particular, all
volatilities fall sharply with the mid-1980’s “Great Moderation.” Technology shock volatility,
moreover, rises sharply in recent years. It is interesting to contrast the stochastic-volatility
estimates to those obtained from the structural-break specification. The latter generally
captures the reduction in volatility after 1984, but not the recent increase during the Great
Recession. Moreover, while the stochastic-volatility specification implies that volatility was
gradually rising throughout the 1970s, the structural-break version is unable to capture this
trend. Finally, the constant-volatility DSGE model systematically overstates volatility once
the Great Moderation begins, because in significant part the model attempts to fit the high
volatility before the Great Moderation.

Point Forecast Construction and Evaluation

where the draws YT +h are generated with Algorithm 1. The posterior mean is of course the
optimal predictor under quadratic loss. To compare the performance of point forecasts we
use root mean squared errors (RMSE’s),

(Yi,T +h − Ŷi,T +h|T )2 ,
P − h T =E

where E is the starting point of the forecast evaluation sample (meaning it is the first forecast
origin) and P is the number of forecast origins.
In Table 2 we present real-time forecast RMSE’s for 1991:Q4 to 2011:Q1. We show
RMSE’s for the benchmark constant-volatility DSGE model in the first line of each panel,
and RMSE ratios in the subsequent lines. Ratios less than one indicate that the forecasts
from the corresponding time-varying volatility model are more accurate than the benchmark
model forecasts. We use the following abbreviations: “Const.” is constant volatility; “DVSB” is deterministic volatility with structural break (17); “SV-AR” is AR(1) stochasticvolatility process (16); and “SV-RW” is random walk stochastic-volatility process (14). In
parentheses we show p-values of Diebold and Mariano (1995) tests of equal MSE against the
one-sided alternative that the model with time-varying volatility is more accurate.

Notes: The real-time forecast sample is 1991:Q4 to 2011:Q1. We calculate forecast errors using actuals
obtained from the most recent vintage. We show RMSE’s for the benchmark constant-volatility DSGE
model in the first line of each panel, and RMSE ratios in the subsequent lines. “Const.” is constant
volatility; “DV-SB” is deterministic volatility with structural break (17); “SV-AR” is AR(1) stochasticvolatility process (16); and “SV-RW” is random-walk stochastic-volatility process (14). In parentheses we
show p-values of Diebold-Mariano tests of equal MSE against the one-sided alternative that the model with
time-varying volatility is more accurate, obtained using standard normal critical values. We compute the
standard errors entering the Diebold-Mariano statistics using Newey-West with bandwidth 0 at the 1-quarter
horizon and (P − h)1/3 in the other cases, where P − h is the number of forecasting origins.

20

Forecasts from the specifications with time-varying volatility are significantly more accurate for the federal funds rate at all horizons, and for inflation at longer horizons. In
contrast, output growth forecast accuracy is very similar across models and horizons. There
is no clear ranking across the three time-varying volatility specifications. The simple deterministic break model performs slightly better in some instances and slightly worse than
the stochastic-volatility versions in other instances. This basic scenario – allowing for timevarying volatility appears somewhat helpful for point forecasting (presumably due to enhanced parameter estimation efficiency), but not massively helpful – is precisely what one
would expect. That is, if time-varying volatility is important, one expects much greater
contributions to interval and density forecasting performance, to which we now turn.

6

Interval Forecast Construction and Evaluation

Posterior interval forecast (credible region) construction is immediate, given the posterior
predictive density, as the interval forecast follows directly from the predictive density. We
focus on single-variable credible intervals as opposed to multi-variable credible regions. We
compute the highest-density 100(1 − α) percent interval forecast for a particular element
Yi,T +h of YT +h by numerically searching for the shortest connected interval that contains
(j)

sim
.
100(1 − α) percent of the draws {Yi,T +h }nj=1

6.1

Relative Evaluation Standards: Coverage and Length

In the interval forecast evaluation that follows, we consider both relative standards (coverage,
length) and absolute standards (conditional calibration).

21

6.1.1

Coverage Rates

In Table 3 (first row of each cell) we report the frequency with which real-time outcomes
for output growth, inflation rate, and the federal funds rate fall inside real-time 70-percent
highest posterior density intervals.8 Correct coverage corresponds to frequencies of about
70-percent, whereas a frequency of greater than (less than) 70 percent means that on average
over a given sample, the posterior density is too wide (narrow). In parentheses we show pvalues of t-statistics of the hypothesis of correct coverage (empirical = nominal coverage of
70 percent), calculated using Newey-West standard errors.
Table 3 makes clear that the constant-volatility DSGE model forecasts for output growth
and inflation at all horizons and for the federal funds rate at the one-quarter horizon tend to
be too wide, so that actual outcomes fall inside the intervals much more frequently than the
nominal 70-percent rate. For example, for the one-step-ahead forecast horizon, the constantvolatility DSGE model coverage rates are around 87 percent. Based on the reported tstatistic p-values, all empirical departures from 70 percent nominal coverage are statistically
significant.
The coverage of the intervals from the models with time-varying volatility, in contrast,
is strikingly good. For all variables and horizons, estimated coverage is much closer to
70 percent, and the p-values indicate that in the vast majority of cases any deviation is
statistically insignificant. On balance, the SV-RW version yields more accurate coverage
rates than the SV-AR specification. The structural break specification also does quite well.
Thus, accounting for the volatility reduction in 1984 due to the Great Moderation appears
to be of first-order importance for interval forecasts.

Results for 90% credible intervals are similar; see the Online Appendix for details.

Notes: The real-time forecast sample is 1991:Q4 to 2011:Q1. We obtain “actuals” from the most recent
vintage. “Const.” is constant volatility; “DV-SB” is deterministic volatility with structural break (17); “SVAR” is AR(1) stochastic-volatility process (16); and “SV-RW” is random-walk stochastic-volatility process
(14). Top row of each cell: we report the frequencies with which outcomes fall in 70-percent bands computed
from the posterior predictive density. In parentheses we show p-values of t-statistics of the hypothesis of
correct coverage (empirical = nominal coverage of 70 percent), calculated using Newey-West standard errors
with bandwidth 0 at the 1-quarter horizon and (P − h)1/3 in the other cases, where P − h is the number of
forecasting origins. Bottom row of each cell: we report the average lengths of prediction intervals.

23

6.1.2

Interval Length

Table 3 (second row of each cell) also shows average prediction interval lengths. Average
lengths based on the time-varying volatility models are roughly 30 percent shorter than those
from the constant-volatility model. Hence the time-varying volatility intervals dominate
on both the coverage and length dimensions. The intervals from the stochastic-volatility
specifications are generally wider than those from the structural break specification. This
seems by and large consistent with Figure 1, which indicates the estimated volatility from
the SV-AR version often exceeds the post-break estimate from the DV-SB specification.

6.2

Absolute Evaluation Standards: Conditional Calibration

We also consider an absolute standard for interval forecasts: conditional calibration. As
detailed in Christoffersen (1998), if interval forecasts are correctly conditionally calibrated,
then the “hit sequence” should have mean (1 − α) and be at most h − 1-dependent, where
(1−α)

the hit sequence is It

= 1{realized yt falls inside the interval}. Note well the two-part

characterization. The hit series must have the correct mean, (1 − α), which corresponds to
correct unconditional calibration, and it must also be at most h − 1-dependent. When both
hold, we have correct conditional calibration.
In Table 4 we present results of Christoffersen’s likelihood-ratio tests for 70-percent 1step-ahead interval forecasts, 1991:Q4 to 2011:Q1. We show separate and joint tests for
correct coverage and independence. The coverage tests consistently find no flaws in the
time-varying volatility DSGE intervals, while simultaneously consistently finding severe flaws
in the constant-volatility DSGE intervals. In general, the random-walk stochastic-volatility
specification SV-RW leads to higher p-values than the SV-AR specification. The structural
break specification fairs slightly better than SV-RW for the inflation rate and worse for the
federal funds rate.

24

Neither the time-varying volatility nor the constant-volatility DSGE interval forecasts
perform consistently well in terms of the independence test. In particular, the p-values
for the federal funds rate tests are all less than 5 percent. This is not unexpected, however,
because small-scale DSGE models are well-known to have weak propagation mechanisms that
fail to fully capture the conditional-mean dependence (serial correlation) in macroeconomic
time series. Incorporating stochastic volatility can naturally fix mis-calibration problems,
but there is no way for it to fix inadequate conditional-mean dynamics.
Finally, the joint test considers both correct coverage and independence. The highest pvalues are obtained for output growth and inflation forecasts by the random-walk stochasticvolatility and the structural-break specifications. All of the federal funds rate forecasts fail
the joint test.

Density Forecast Construction and Evaluation

Density forecast construction is immediate, given the posterior predictive density. The predictive density is the density forecast.

7.1

Relative Evaluation Standards: Log Predictive Likelihood

We use the log predictive likelihood for relative density forecast accuracy comparison, as in
Warne et al. (2016).9 The predictive likelihood is

SM (h) =

E+P
X−h
1
log p(ỸT +h |Y1:T ),
P − h T =E

h = 1, 2, ..., H,

(19)

where E is the starting point of the forecast evaluation sample, P is the number of forecast
origins, and h is the forecast horizon. We distinguish Ỹ from Y because we exclude the
10-year-ahead inflation expectations IN Ft10y from the predictive likelihood. M denotes
marginal, as opposed to joint, predictive likelihood, which can be defined as

SJ (h) =

E+P
X−h
1
log p(ỸT +1:T +h |Y1:T ),
P − h T =E

h = 1, 2, ..., H.

Obviously the joint and marginal predictive likelihood concepts lead to the same quantity
when h = 1. To compute the marginal predictive density SM (h), after Step 3 of Algorithm 1
(j)

(j)

(j)

we evaluate the density p(YT +h |νT +1:T +h , θ(j) , sT , νT ). This density is Gaussian and can be
obtained from the Kalman filter, treating the observations YT +1:T +h−1 as missing. Averaging
across draws j leads to the Monte Carlo approximation

p(YT +h |Y1:T ) ≈

taken.

Figure 2: 1-Step-Ahead Predictive Densities
Recursive Average

Period-By-Period Increments

Notes: The real-time forecast sample is 1991:Q4 to 2011:Q1. We obtain “actuals” from the most recent
vintage. “Const.” is constant volatility; “DV-SB” is deterministic volatility with structural break (17); “SVAR” is AR(1) stochastic-volatility process (16); and “SV-RW” is random-walk stochastic-volatility process
(14).

28

In Figure 2 we show a time-series plot of 1-step-ahead predictive density values for GDP
growth, inflation, and interest rates. The bottom panel shows period-by-period predictive
likelihoods, whereas the top panel depicts the evolution of the recursive average SM (1) as the
number of prediction periods P increases. Judging from the recursive average, after 1994 the
two stochastic-volatility specifications dominate the constant volatility model. The structural
break specification performs fairly well between 1994 and 2002, but then its performance
starts to deteriorate.
The plot of the period-by-period predictive densities indicates that the relative ranking of
the specifications changes over time. From 1994 to 2002 and 2005 to 2007, the time-varying
volatility models perform better than the constant-volatility model. In the midst of the Great
Recession 2008:Q4 output growth drops substantially and unexpectedly from the perspective
of a wide variety of aggregate time series models. In this period the constant-volatility model
fares better than its competitors because due to the pre-1984 observations, its estimated
shock innovations are relatively large, in particular for the government spending and the
technology shock (see Figure 1). Thus, the large drop in real activity appears less unexpected
than for the time-varying volatility specifications. The stochastic-volatility models are able
to adapt to the increase in macroeconomic volatility during the Great Recession (with a lag),
whereas the structural break model is not.

Notes: The real-time forecast sample is 1991:Q4 to 2011:Q1. We evaluate the predictive densities at the
actuals obtained from the most recent vintage. “Const.” is constant volatility; “DV-SB” is deterministic
volatility with structural break (17); “SV-AR” is AR(1) stochastic-volatility process (16); and “SV-RW”
is random-walk stochastic-volatility process (14). We present predictive likelihoods for density forecasts at
horizons h = 1, 2, 4, 8, for output growth, the inflation rate, and the fed funds rate. We show in bold the
“winners,” for each horizon and each variable.

30

In Table 5 we present marginal predictive likelihoods for density forecasts at horizons
h = 1, 2, 4, 8. From a univariate prediction perspective, the time-varying volatility specifications dominate the constant-volatility specification at horizons h = 1, 2, 4. The structural
break specification fares slightly better for output growth, whereas the stochastic-volatility
specifications work better for the inflation and federal funds rates. For h = 1, 2 the random
walk stochastic-volatility process is preferred whereas for longer horizons the mean-reverting
autoregressive process generates more accurate density forecasts. From a multivariate perspective, the random-walk stochastic volatility model is preferred at the one-step horizon
(see also Figure 2). At h = 2 it is essentially a tie between the SV-RW and the constantvolatility specifications10 , whereas at horizons h = 4, 8 the constant-volatility version comes
out ahead.

7.2

Absolute Evaluation Standards: Conditional Calibration

The predictive log likelihood density forecast comparison approach described above invokes
a relative standard; using the log predictive density, it ranks density forecasts according to
assessed likelihoods of the observed realization sequence. It is also of general interest to assess
density forecasts relative to a different, absolute standard, correct conditional calibration.

Notes: The real-time forecast sample is 1991:Q4 to 2011:Q1. We calculate forecast errors using actuals
obtained from the most recent vintage. We group PIT’s into five equally-sized bins. Under uniformity, each
bin should contain 20 percent of the PIT’s, as indicated by the horizontal red lines.

Following Diebold et al. (1998), we rely on the probability integral transform (PIT). The
PIT of Yi,T +h based on the time-T predictive distribution is defined as the cumulative density
of the random variable Yi,T +h evaluated at the true realization of Yi,T +h ,
Z

Yi,T +h

p(Ỹi,T +h |Y1:T )dỸi,T +h .

zi,h,T =

We compute PIT’s by the Monte Carlo average of the indicator function,

zi,h,T ≈

nsim
1 X

nsim

(j)

I{Yi,T +h ≤ Yi,T +h }.

j=1

If the predictive distribution is correctly conditionally calibrated, then zi,h,T should be distributed U (0, 1) and be at most h − 1-dependent.
In Figure 3 we report PIT histograms for forecast horizons h = 1, 4, for DSGE models
with constant and time-varying volatility. We group PIT’s into five equally sized bins. Under
uniformity, each bin should contain 20 percent of the PIT’s, as indicated by the horizontal
red lines in the figure. Checking histograms alone essentially effectively amounts to checking
unconditional calibration.
Histograms for the constant-volatility model appear highly non-uniform. For output
growth, too few PIT’s are in the extreme bins, indicating that the predictive distribution
tends to be too diffuse. Similarly, for the inflation rate, too few PIT’s are in the extreme
left-tail bin (0-0.2), and for the fed funds rate too few PIT’s are in the extreme right-tail
bin (0.8-1). In contrast, histograms for the structural break and the stochastic-volatility
(random walk) specifications appear much more uniform.11
We present PIT sample autocorrelations in Figure 4. They essentially look the same for
all four specifications considered in this paper. For brevity we only plot them for the random11

walk stochastic-volatility model. Clear deviations from independence are apparent. Hence,
although the time-varying-volatility DSGE models appear unconditionally well calibrated (in
contrast to the constant-volatility model), they are nevertheless not correctly conditionally
calibrated, because they fail the independence condition. This pattern, and its underlying
reasons, matches precisely our earlier results for interval forecasts.

Conclusion

We have examined the real-time accuracy of point, interval and density forecasts of output
growth, inflation, and the federal funds rate, generated from DSGE models with and without
stochastic volatility. The stochastic-volatility versions are superior to the constant-volatility
versions. We traced the superiority of stochastic-volatility forecasts to superior coverage
rates (for interval forecasts) and superior PIT uniformity (for density forecasts) – essentially
superior unconditional calibration of the stochastic-volatility forecasts. We also compared
the performance of the stochastic-volatility specifications to a model with a one-time break
in shock standard deviations at the end of 1984. The structural-break version performs
generally better than the constant-volatility model, but is unable to adapt to the change
in macroeconomic volatility during the Great Recession. Neither model, however, appears
correctly conditionally calibrated, as correct conditional calibration requires both correct
unconditional calibration and a type of “error independence” condition, which fails to hold.

Evaluation of 90% Probability Interval Forecasts

We repeat the evaluation of interval forecasts presented in Section 6 for 90% probability
intervals. The results are summarized in Tables A-1 and A-2. Including stochastic volatility
generally improves the actual coverage rate of 90% predictive intervals.

Notes: The real-time forecast sample is 1991:Q4 to 2011:Q1. We obtain “actuals” from the most recent
vintage. “Const.” is constant volatility; “DV-SB” is deterministic volatility with structural break (17); “SVAR” is AR(1) stochastic-volatility process (16); and “SV-RW” is random-walk stochastic-volatility process
(14). Top row of each cell: we report the frequencies with which outcomes fall in 90-percent bands computed
from the posterior predictive density. In parentheses we show p-values of t-statistics of the hypothesis of
correct coverage (empirical = nominal coverage of 90 percent), calculated using Newey-West standard errors
with bandwidth 0 at the 1-quarter horizon and (P − h)1/3 in the other cases, where P − h is the number of
forecasting origins. Bottom row of each cell: we report the average lengths of prediction intervals.

Notes: We show results for 90-percent 1-step-ahead interval forecasts. The real-time forecast sample is
1991:Q4 to 2011:Q1. We obtain “actuals” from the most recent vintage. “Const.” is constant volatility;
“DV-SB” is deterministic volatility with structural break (17); “SV-AR” is AR(1) stochastic-volatility process

Ending the Evaluation Period in 2007:Q4

We now only use vintages up until January 2008. This last vintage utilizes NIPA data ending
in 2007:Q3 and the 2007:Q4 observation is the last observation that we forecast.
Table A-3 summarizes the RMSEs for point forecasts. Compared to Table 2 in the main
text the absolute values of the RMSEs are lower if the Great Recession is excluded from the
forecast evaluation. The ranking of constant-volatility and time-varying volatility forecasts
is largely unaffected.
Table A-4 shows the coverage probabilities. The p-values for output growth and inflation
slightly drop, whereas the p-values for the federal funds rate intervals slightly increase. It
remains true that the coverage probability of the models with time-varying volatility is
generally closer to the nominal coverage probability of the predictive interval.
Table A-5 shows the results for the Christoffersen test. With respect to independence,
the p-values for output growth increase whereas the p-values for inflation slightly decrease.
On balance, the table leads to the same conclusions as the results reported in the main text.
Table A-6 shows average marginal predictive likelihoods. The pattern of highest marginal
likelihood specifications is identical to the pattern reported in the main text.
Figure A-1 compares the distribution of one-step-ahead PITs for the samples that end in
2011:Q1 and 2007:Q4, respectively. For the shorter sample it is still true that allowing for
time-varying volatility makes the PIT distribution more uniform. Moreover, the spike in the
0-0.2 for the interest rate forecasts is smoothed out, because there are now fewer periods in
which the interest rate is zero.

Notes: The real-time forecast sample is 1991:Q4 to 2007:Q4. We calculate forecast errors using actuals
obtained from the most recent vintage. We show RMSE’s for the benchmark constant-volatility DSGE
model in the first line of each panel, and RMSE ratios in the subsequent lines. “Const.” is constant
volatility; “DV-SB” is deterministic volatility with structural break (17); “SV-AR” is AR(1) stochasticvolatility process (16); and “SV-RW” is random-walk stochastic-volatility process (14). In parentheses we
show p-values of Diebold-Mariano tests of equal MSE against the one-sided alternative that the model with
time-varying volatility is more accurate, obtained using standard normal critical values. We compute the
standard errors entering the Diebold-Mariano statistics using Newey-West with bandwidth 0 at the 1-quarter
horizon and (P − h)1/3 in the other cases, where P − h is the number of forecasting origins.

Notes: We show results for 70-percent 1-step-ahead interval forecasts. The real-time forecast sample is
1991:Q4 to 2007:Q4. We obtain “actuals” from the most recent vintage. “Const.” is constant volatility;
“DV-SB” is deterministic volatility with structural break (17); “SV-AR” is AR(1) stochastic-volatility process
(16); and “SV-RW” is random-walk stochastic-volatility process (14). We show tests for coverage and for
independence, as well as joint tests, with p-values in parentheses.

Notes: The real-time forecast sample is 1991:Q4 to 2007:Q4. We evaluate the predictive densities at the
actuals obtained from the most recent vintage. “Const.” is constant volatility; “DV-SB” is deterministic
volatility with structural break (17); “SV-AR” is AR(1) stochastic-volatility process (16); and “SV-RW”
is random-walk stochastic-volatility process (14). We present predictive likelihoods for density forecasts at
horizons h = 1, 2, 4, 8, for output growth, the inflation rate, and the fed funds rate. We show in bold the
“winners,” for each horizon and each variable.

Notes: The real-time forecast sample is 1991:Q4 to 2011:Q1. We calculate forecast errors using actuals
obtained from the most recent vintage. We group PIT’s into five equally-sized bins. Under uniformity, each
bin should contain 20 percent of the PIT’s, as indicated by the horizontal red lines.
