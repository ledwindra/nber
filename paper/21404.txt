Content Aggregation by Platforms: The Case of the News Media
Lesley Chiou and Catherine Tucker
NBER Working Paper No. 21404
July 2015
JEL No. L63,L82,L86,L88
ABSTRACT
The digitization of content has led to the emergence of platforms that draw information from multiple
sources. Policymakers are concerned that these new platforms threaten incentives for the production
of original content. As a result, policymakers are contemplating regulations that would force aggregation
platforms to pay or require an explicit "opt-in" for content providers. To understand the possible consequences
and underlying rationale of such laws, we explore whether aggregation of content by a single platform
encourages users to "skim" content or to investigate in depth. We study a contract dispute that led
a major aggregator to remove information from a major content provider. We find that after the removal,
users were less likely to investigate additional, related content in depth, particularly sources that were
horizontally or vertically differentiated.

Introduction

Platforms play an important role as intermediaries. By bringing together two sides of a
market, platforms can facilitate transactions and provide information that consumers then
use for making decisions. In recent years, the digitization of content has led to the prominence
of platforms as aggregators of content in many economically important industries, including
media and Internet-based industries (Evans and Schmalensee, 2012).
These new platforms consolidate content from multiple sources into one place, thereby
lowering the transactions costs of obtaining content and introducing new information to
consumers. Such aggregation platforms represent a shift away from peer-to-peer platforms
operating outside of the law towards platforms that aggregate digital content within a legal
framework, including Spotify for music, Hulu for movies, and Google News for news content.
While an extensive literature has focused on pricing and piracy by platforms (Rob and
Waldfogel, 2006; Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf, 2007; Danaher et al., 2010), little is known
about how the quantity and quality of content provided by a platform that tries to operate
within legal bounds influences consumer search and the resulting consequences for content
providers.
For these reasons, platforms have attracted considerable legal and policy attention. For
instance, musicians have sued Spotify, a music aggregator, for its creation of music playlists
(Gardner, 2014). A platform aggregator of movie scripts has been sued by Fox for infringing
on copyright (Masnick, 2010). The news agency L’ Agence France Presse has sued Google
News for aggregating its content and infringing copyright (Isbell, 2010). Recent regulation
in the European Union has attempted to make content on a platform an “opt-in” decision
(Pfanner, 2012; Eddy, 2013) where a content provider has the right to decide whether or
not their content appears on the aggregation platform. Therefore, a natural question for
a content provider is how opting in to providing content on a platform affects consumer

2

behavior on the platform. Content producers fear that consumers may use these extracts
of content as a substitute for accessing and reading the full content. Platforms argue that
aggregation encourages users to seek out additional content because aggregators feature
multiple sources. In practice, this open question is an empirical one.
To investigate the potential importance of these issues, we examine how a change in
content provided by a platform affects subsequent consumer search for different types of
information and its consequences for content providers. We study the case of the news
media industry. The news media industry presents an attractive setting for studying these
issues, due to the rapid growth of digital news content, multiple content providers who have
expressed fears about the viability of their business model in the presence of aggregators,
and the prominence of platforms such as Google News. Specifically, we focus on arguably
two of the largest players in US news media industry, Google News and The Associated Press
(AP). Google News is among the most-read news aggregators, automating the aggregation
of news content from 25,000 news sources. The Associated Press is a prominent content
provider and was created in 1846 to fund news-gathering activities between its newspaper
participants. The Associated Press has received 51 Pulitzer Prizes, reflecting its status in
the news industry and investments in journalism.
To overcome a major challenge in tackling these questions, we use a novel approach
and exploit a contract dispute as an exogenous shifter of the availability of content on
Google News. In January 2010, after a breakdown in licensing negotiations, Google removed
all news articles that were syndicated by The Associated Press from its news aggregator
(Haddad, 2010). These articles were typically shortened versions of stories that appeared in
a select number of The AP-associated newspapers. The contractual dispute provides a useful
case study to examine the effects of a content provider “opting-out” of providing content
and therefore the role of the aggregation platform in influencing consumer behavior. One
attractive feature of studying this dispute is the scale of The Associated Press. Not only
3

does the removal represent a large shock, but the removal of content most likely did not
reflect the wishes of a particular newspaper or any self-selection issues. Since The AP was
created historically with deep ties to the news media, The AP can capture a broader effect
of content change for news media.
We compare users’ website visits before and after this contract dispute relative to traffic
from Yahoo! News, which continued to provide The Associated Press content during this
period. We link the insights from our empirical results to the theoretical literature on
platforms. In theory, on one hand, consumers may use platforms to scan the extracts of
content without clicking through to pursue more in-depth material (“scanning effect”). On
the other hand, consumers may use platforms to explore new material more deeply (“traffic
effect.”) Our data allows us to measure both of these effects.
Our results indicate that after The Associated Press content was removed from Google
News, fewer users subsequently visited news sites after navigating to Google News relative
to users who had used Yahoo! News. The pattern was driven by news websites that were
specifically local in content or news websites with national recognition as being high quality.
Thus, we find evidence that the traffic effect is large, as aggregators may guide users to new
content. We do not find evidence of a scanning effect, as overall traffic to Google News
and Yahoo! News remained relatively comparable during our time period. We also explore
the institutional relationship between news sites and The AP and find that websites with
stronger ties to The AP suffered a drop in traffic after the dispute.
Our results inform the legal and public policies for two reasons. First, our results suggest
that the decision to opt-in to an aggregation platform should depend on whether the content
provider is considered high-quality or highly unusual. Both these characteristics, appear to
encourage users to use the aggregator to explore content more deeply instead of scanning
content. Second, one surprising development is that despite Germany publishers lobbying for
an opt-in law, none have chosen to opt-out (Lomas, 2013). Our paper provides an explanation
4

of such behavior—ultimately aggregators may benefit many newspapers, especially highquality ones, and the purpose of the “opt-in” provision may be to increase bargaining power
over payments to news providers rather than an actual desire for copyright holders to opt-out
of the aggregator systems.
Our focus is not on how aggregators affect direct navigation to the content providers’
websites—Sandoval (2009), Arrington (2010), and Athey and Mobius (2012) discuss this.
Instead, we measure how a platform’s expansion or contraction of content affects subsequent
navigation by users. More broadly, our analysis is also related to prior work that describes
how digital technologies have affected search costs and generated spillovers (Shapiro and
Varian, 1999; Bakos, 1997; Ghose et al., 2011; Greenstein, 2011). The novelty of our study is
that we are the first to explore how digital technology affects the set of information gathered
by consumers.
Our results have implications for copyright policy regarding platforms that aggregate
digital content. The digital revolution has challenged various aspects of copyright protection
(Greenstein et al., 2011) but much of the focus has been on peer-to-peer piracy rather
than newer legitimate business models that aggregate specific kinds of content. Online
aggregators in media assert that their practice is protected by copyright law because they only
display small extracts of information and often this information is factual (Isbell, 2010). Our
empirical distinction between a scanning effect where the aggregator substitutes for original
content and a traffic effect where the aggregator is complementary, is useful for analyzing the
potential policy implications of such business models. The fact we find evidence of a “traffic
effect” even with a relatively large amount of content on an aggregator, is perhaps evidence
that the “fair use” exemptions often relied on by such sites are less potentially damaging to
the original copyright holder than often thought.

Institutional Setting and Data
Contractual Dispute between Google and The Associated Press

Google News is ranked as the fifth most visited news website by Hitwise. Receiving 2.90%
of all news site visits, Google News is the second most popular news aggregator service
after Yahoo! News, which received 7.09% of all news site visits. Google News electronically
aggregates different news sources based upon a proprietary algorithm. As of December 2009,
Google News claimed that it received news content from 25,000 publishers across the world
and that it sent one billion clicks to these publishers every month (Cohen, 2009). Figure
1 provides a screenshot of Google News. Google News has two noticeable features that
distinguish it from traditional news sites. First, a variety of sources are listed for each story.
Second, the order of news is electronically determined based upon users’ preferences, the
recency of the story, and the interest it has received from other users.
The Associated Press (AP), founded in 1846, is one of the largest news agencies in the
world. Since the demise of United Press International, The AP is the only national news
service in the US, and its major competitors are Reuters (based in the United Kingdom)
and Agence-France Presse (based in France). The AP is a cooperative owned by various
newspapers and radio and television stations in the United States. These stakeholders both
contribute stories to The AP and use material written by The AP staff journalists. During the
past decade, The AP has been at the forefront of efforts by copyright holders to circumscribe
“fair use” for digital content and to protect copyholders’ rights. For example, in June 2008,
The AP invoked the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and insisted that various bloggers
remove The AP content (Ardia, 2008).
The origins of The AP and its business model reveal that The AP’s role was to serve
as a coordination function in the old media world of physical newspapers, and to allow
newspapers to pool content and stories and hence enjoy economies of scale in news reporting.

Note: On June, 30 2010, the formatting of Google News changed somewhat and reduced the ability of users
to customize the placement of the columns containing news. Therefore the screenshot above, which was
produced after this formatting change, may be slightly different from what users viewed during the period
that we study.

Little evidence exists that The AP has tried to push its own website as an alternative “newswire” service; instead, The AP website functions mainly as a corporate site which simply
lists member newspapers. The AP’s reluctance to perform a news-wire role may be due to
its origins as a newspaper association; it may be reluctant to pursue anything that competes
directly with a newspaper’s business model. It is not clear how an organization founded
under the traditional model where each newspaper provided full news coverage to individual
print subscribers fits into a world where consumers consume news digitally. Table 1, which
summarizes the major events of the AP and Google relationship, makes clear that The AP
is worried about the implications of the rise of search and aggregation technology for its
business model.
Since both The AP and Google News are key players in the distribution of news online,
it is not surprising they have forged a partnership. Their licensing agreement also protects
Google News from allegations of copyright infringement over The AP content, given the
current uncertainty over copyright law for aggregators. We study a discontinuity in this
relationship, produced by negotiations surrounding the contract renewal at the end of January 2010. As part of their existing contract, Google and The AP agreed that The AP
content could be hosted by Google for a period of 30 days. Therefore, if the contract ended
in January 2010 and was not renewed, Google would stop posting new content from The
Associated Press 30 days prior to the end of the contract. Presumably to make this “clean
break” a credible outside option, Google did indeed stop posting content for seven weeks
during these contract negotiations (Krazit, 2010). We should emphasize that our discussion
is necessarily based upon the observations of industry outsiders, since both Google and The
AP signed binding non-disclosure agreements, which prevented them from ever commenting
on the course or outcome of negotiations (Sullivan, 2010).
The removal of The AP content represents a useful quasi-experiment. Since the removal
of content was provoked by the intricacies of contract negotiations, its timing can be thought
8

of as reasonably exogenous, as the removal was determined by the expiration of the contract
rather than any considerations of the popularity (or lack thereof) of The AP content at that
time. As detailed in Table 1, Google removed The AP content from December 23, 2009 until
sometime in February 2010. Fortunately for our purposes, Yahoo! News continued to host
The AP content without interruption during this time, which enables us to use the behavior
of Yahoo! News users as a control in our regressions. We compare which websites consumers
navigated to after visiting a news aggregator (either Google News or Yahoo! News) before
and after the removal of content on Google News.
It is not clear whether the removal of content will lead aggregator users to seek more or
less news after visiting the aggregator. In essence, do consumers use aggregators to go more
in depth into content (“a traffic effect”) or in lieu of content sites (“scanning effect”)? This
depends upon whether consumers view news aggregators as a complement or substitute to
original news sources.
For instance, The AP ran a news story about the economic depression in Michigan.
The screenshot of how the story appeared on Google News is depicted in Figure 2. The
links related to The Associated Press story that appear at the bottom of a typical story
are also depicted in Figure 2. After reading The Associated Press summary of the story,
readers are free to explore the issue further in local newspapers such as the Detroit News
and Lansing State Journal. These papers are local affiliates of The Associated Press and
typically expand in their newspapers on the summary The Associated Press content. We
ask whether the presence of The Associated Press content on Google News makes it more
or less likely that a news consumer would then trouble to visit Detroit News or the Lansing
State Journal, both of which are members of The Associated Press Network.
Our preliminary analysis focuses on the period immediately prior to and during the removal of The AP articles from Google News from December 2009 to January 2010. Contract
negotiations continued until August 30, 2010 when a long-term contract was signed between
9

Google News and The AP (Krazit, 2010). We also examine the consequences of the reinstatement of the long-term relationship between Google News and The AP between January
2010 and October 2010.1 As can be seen in the screenshot in Figure 2, some of The AP
1

In the interim, on February 2010, a temporary short-term deal was agreed upon which gave rise to the
content that can be seen in Figure 2. It is not clear at which point in February the relationship was resumed
between Google News and The AP. It is also not apparent whether the short-term deal during this time
consisted of the older, missing content or new content or whether Google changed the presentation of The AP
articles afterwards. For example, it would be problematic if Google decided to highlight The AP content after
the contract negotiations were concluded, perhaps as a “sweetener” while on-going negotiations continued
until September. For these reasons, we collect data on the full reinstatement of the long-term relationship
between Google News and The AP that resumed.

10

content was already restored at the end of August, however, it appears that October is the
appropriate date of analysis for the reinstatement of The AP material. Since content is
added daily and appears for 30 days on Google News, one month following August 30 is
the month of October 2010 when all content for the past 30 days was fully reinstated and
available.

Description of Data on Consumer Behavior

Our data derive from Experian Hitwise. Hitwise “develops proprietary software that Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) use to analyze website logs created on their network.” Once the ISP
aggregates the anonymous data, the data are provided to Hitwise. According to their website,
Hitwise collects these usage data from a “geographically diverse range of ISP networks and
opt-in panels, representing all types of Internet usage, including home, work, education
and public access.” Currently, Hitwise has usage data from a sample of 25 million people
worldwide. We include further details on Hitwise’s data collection in the Appendix.
Hitwise provides aggregate information on the sites that users visit immediately after
navigating to Google News or Yahoo! News. We use weekly data on the top 2000 sites
navigated to by consumers after visiting Google News or Yahoo! News during the week
ending December 5, 2009 to the week ending January 30, 2010. Hitwise reports the fraction
of total traffic that arrives at these “downstream” sites immediately after a visit to Google
News and Yahoo! News. When Hitwise reports data for downstream sites, it tracks websurfing behavior by recording where people navigate to after visiting a particular site at an
aggregate level.
We constructed a panel of the percentage of weekly visits a downstream website received
from either Google News or Yahoo! News. For instance, we observe the weekly share of
visits that nytimes.com receives out of all visits to websites by users immediately after using
Google News. In our sample, twenty-six percent of websites received incoming traffic from

11

both Google and Yahoo! News. The remainder of websites were only visited after navigating
to one particular aggregator. This pattern may reflect internal complementarities for these
companies. For instance, someone using Google News is unlikely to navigate to Yahoo! Mail,
and similarly, someone using Yahoo! News is unlikely to navigate to Gmail.
To identify which sites are related to The AP, we categorized the websites into two main
classes: “news” (e.g., newyorktimes.com, bostonherald.com) and “non-news” (e.g., Yahoo!
Mail, Youtube.com). Our news category consists of a strict definition of sites that fall under
Hitwise’s categories of print media and broadcast media. We made sure that these news
sites reflected The AP network of member news organizations as well as news outlets that
subscribe to The AP service and provide The AP content. As we are interested in traffic to
websites of primary news sources, we exclude weather sites and the top aggregators—e.g.,
Yahoo! News, Google News, AOL News, Bing News, Ask News, Huffington Post—from the
“news” category. In addition, we use Hitwise’s identification of non-US domains to exclude
international sites (e.g., bbc.com/news, hindustantimes.com) from the “news” category, since
we do not expect the removal of The AP content to affect international sites that tend to
either generate their own content or rely on non-American news agencies for their content.
We use data on international sites in our robustness checks. Given the set of “news” sites,
we refer to all other sites within our sample as “non-news.”
Table 2 reports the summary statistics for our data. A site received on average 0.016
percent of downstream visits. News sites represent 15 percent of all sites where we observe
subsequent visits within our sample, and non-news sites account for 85 percent. Aggregator,
international, and weather sites account for a smaller fraction of sites compared to news
sites.
Table 3 displays the top 40 news websites in our dataset and the average percentage of
downstream visits they received from either Google News or Yahoo! News. Downstream
visits refer to the number of visits to a website immediately after navigating to the news

Note: This table reports statistics for websites visited immediately after Google News and Yahoo! News during December
2009 and January 2010. The variable %visits refers to the percentage of visits from each search engine that navigated to a
particular site; this variable is measured from 0 to 1. The dispute between The Associated Press and Google News occurred
after December 23, 2009. The variable AP ContentRemoval
is an indicator variable for whether the week occurred during
the period of the dispute. News sites refer to print media and
broadcast media sites as defined by Hitwise, excluding weather
sites, international news sites, and top news aggregators.

aggregator. Table 4 displays the top 40 non-news websites in our dataset, excluding international and aggregator sites, and the average percentage of downstream visits they receive. As
shown in Table 4, the top non-news websites reflect the top website brands on the Internet.
To verify that Yahoo! News could be considered an appropriate control group for Google
News, we checked that the users shared similar observable demographics. Hitwise reports
the fraction of users within each demographic category for a particular site. As seen in Table
A-1 in the Appendix, the users of Yahoo! News and Google News do indeed look reasonably
similar; the users are skewed towards being older, predominantly male, and wealthier than the
general U.S. population. For comparison, we also report demographics for users of the New
York Times website. The users of the New York Times site are similar, though significantly
older, than the average users of a news aggregator. Table A-1 also provides suggestive
evidence of why the debate over ad revenues from news content is so contentious. These
readers are a remarkably attractive demographic group from an advertiser’s perspective.

3.1

Analysis
Theoretical Predictions of Scanning and Traffic

Theoretically two countervailing forces exist when users arrive at an aggregator and use
it to search for information. Consumers may use aggregators to explore content more in
depth (“traffic effect”) or in lieu of content sites (“scanning effect.”) These effects have
been captured in theoretical models of platforms and aggregators. For instance, Jeon and
Esfahani (2012) describes “market expansion” and “business-stealing” effects of aggregators.
Rutt (2011) examines a model with two types of consumers—those “loyal” to original content
sites and “searchers” who use aggregators. More generally, the effects can be described as to
what extent content on platforms as well as aggregators are “complements” and “substitutes”
(Athey et al., 2011; George and Hogendorn, 2012).
Under the “scanning effect,” consumers scan all articles at an aggregator and either finish
14

their search or move on to further articles, depending upon whether the article satisfies them.
The interpretation of “fair use” and other facets of copyright law shape the scanning effect. If
fair use is more permissive, then more content is featured on aggregator, which leads scanning
to be more valuable. Consumers may scan more content at a single site. Our study examines
a change in content at one aggregator. If consumers use the aggregator for scanning, then
the removal of The AP content will reduce the quality of scanning, and subsequently, total
visits to Google News may decline as consumers seek other aggregators.
The “traffic effect” suggests that consumers are interested in pursuing content more in
depth. When consumers read a headline or excerpt on the aggregators, they will be prompted
to click on the links to the content provider for further details of the story. If consumers use
aggregators to “dig” for more content, then the removal of The AP content will lead to less
traffic to news sites.
We will empirically test for the two effects of scanning and traffic in our analysis below.
3.2

The Scanning Effect: Overall Visits to an Aggregator

First, to test for the scanning effect, we investigate whether the removal of The AP content
from Google News led to a shift away from Google News. The idea is that if consumers use
aggregators to merely scan headlines and excerpts of articles, then the removal of content
from Google News will lower the quality of scanning on Google News. Consumers will shift
away from Google News towards other aggregators.
We collect additional data from comScore on total visits to Google News and Yahoo!
News. ComScore tracks the online activity of a panel of more than 2 million users based in
the US and subsequently aggregates their search patterns for resale to commercial clients.
ComScore recruits its panel members through affiliate programs and partnering with third
party application providers. ComScore emphasizes and discusses the representativeness of
their sample to the general population in their Marketer User Guide. ComScore data has also

15

been used in several academic studies and noted as a “highly regarded proprietary [source]
for information on the size and composition of media audiences” (Gentzkow and Shapiro,
2011; Montgomery et al., 2004; De Los Santos et al., 2012; Chiou and Tucker, 2010).
Table 5 reports the number of monthly visits to each aggregator during our period of
study. We do not find evidence of a precipitous drop in monthly visits to Google News
relative to Yahoo! News in the wake of the dispute from December 2009 to January 2010.
When we checked the Hitwise data, we found no evidence of changes in behavior. Indeed,
throughout the period we study, Google News remained solidly ranked as fifth for unique
visits among news websites while Yahoo! remained ranked as first. Moreover, no change
occurred in alternative metrics such as “average visit time” or the number of pages navigated
within a website. The share of page views among all news and media sites were 7% and 3%
for Yahoo! News and Google News. The average visit time for Google was 22 to 23 seconds,
and the average visit time for Yahoo was 5 seconds.
In theory, removing The AP content reduces the quality of scanning on Google News
and could potentially reduce total visits to Google News as it loses in competition to other
aggregators. We do not find evidence that competing aggregators act as substitute platforms
for one another.
3.3

The Traffic Effect: Downstream Visits after an Aggregator

In this section, we investigate the magnitude of the “traffic effect.” We explore whether
content on a news aggregator prompts users to seek further news. We examine whether
traffic to news sites from Google News falls after the removal of The AP content from
Google News. Our preliminary analysis examines visits to news sites after navigating to an
aggregator.
Figure 3 illustrates the aggregate mean percentage of downstream traffic to news and
non-news sites for users that visited Google News and Yahoo! News during this period. As

16

seen in the graph, little change occurs in downstream site navigation for Yahoo! However,
news sites experience a decline in visits from Google News during the period of the removal of
The AP content, relative to the change in traffic from Yahoo! News. To investigate whether
this pattern could be due to underlying seasonality in news consumption, we examine the
change in visits in the prior year during the same calendar months. Figure 4 illustrates that
no such change in visits occurred between December 2008 and January 2009.

To formalize the insights provided by Figure 3, we run a difference-in-differences regression for the policy change and estimate percentage of visits to website i after visiting news
aggregator j in week t. We use a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework to estimate
the following equation:

g(E(%visitsijt )) = β0 + β1 N ewsi × Googlej × AP ContentRemovalt
+ β2 N ewsi × AP ContentRemovalt + β3 N ewsi × Googlej
+ β4 Googlej + αi + weekt + ijt

where g(.) is the generalized function, E(%visits) is the expected value of the percentage
of visits, N ews is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the website is a news site, Google is
an indicator variable equal to 1 if the traffic originated after viewing Google News, and
AP ContentRemoval is an indicator variable equal to 1 for the weeks after the removal of
The AP content from Google News. The controls α are downstream-website fixed effects.2
The vector weekt contains weekly fixed effects to capture national variation in the volume
and interest generated by news stories in that week. The coefficient β1 on the interaction
term N ews × Google × AP ContentRemoval captures the effect of The AP content removal
on visits to news sites compared to non-news sites from Google News with the corresponding
change in news and non-news sites on Yahoo! as a control.
Our outcome variable is the probability or share for each website as measured relative
to a particular aggregator. Our specification captures the probability or percentage of visits
to website i after visiting news aggregator j in week t where the percentage is calculated
from all outgoing visits from aggregator j. For instance, if Vjt is the number of all outgoing
visits from search engine j in week t to any site and vijt is the number of outgoing visits
from search engine j in week t to site i, then we observe the percentage of visits where
2

Due to computational limitations, we include fixed effects for the top 500 websites.

21

%visitsijt = vijt /Vjt . If consumers were equally likely to visit news sites before and after
the policy change, then the measure of the share of outgoing traffic to news sites from each
aggregator will remain the same. The shares of each site outgoing from Google News are
measured as a fraction or probability conditional on traffic to Google News. In other words,
the market shares are calculated separately for Google News and Yahoo! News. Because
the dependent variable is measured relative to traffic from each news aggregator separately,
the share of outbound traffic to news sites would remain the same even with shifts in total
traffic to each news site.
We estimate this specification using a Generalized Linear Model with a fractional response
variable (Papke and Wooldridge, 1996). Following Papke and Wooldridge (2008), a GLM
with link logit function g(.) and family binomial takes into account that the dependent
variable (percentage of visits) lies between 0 and 1. We cluster our standard errors at the
website level to avoid the downward bias reported by Bertrand et al. (2004).
Table 6 reports the results in Column (1) for the coefficients in our full specification as
described by equation (1). The months December 2009 and January 2010 reflect the period
before and after the dispute between The AP and Google News. The negative coefficient on
N ews × Google × AP ContentRemoval implies that during the dispute with The Associated
Press, Google News users were less likely to visit news websites after visiting Google News.
This suggests that the presence of The Associated Press articles in Google News prompted
users to seek further information at news sites. More generally, our results suggest that news
aggregators may complement the news sources that they feature by directing traffic to these
news sites.
Under the GLM logit link, we interpret our exponentiated coefficients as odds ratios. In
our setting, the odds is the probability of visiting a site compared to the probability of not
visiting a site, or the share of visits to a site compared to the share of visits to all other sites.
The coefficient -0.332 on AP ContentRemoval × Google × N ews implies that the odds ratio
22

is 0.72 or 72 percent of its level prior to the policy change, since the exponential of -0.332 is
0.72. In other words, the odds ratio fell by 28 percent. Consequently, the odds of visiting
a news site on Google News relative to a non-news site on Google News decreased by 28
percent compared to the odds of visiting a news site on Yahoo! News relative to a non-news
site on Yahoo! News.

In Column (1), the removal of The AP content is the removal of hosted articles by The Associated
Press from Google News in January 2010. In Column (2), the restoration of The AP content is
the restoration of hosted articles by The Associated Press in Google News in October 2010. In
Column (3), the falsification check compares December 2009 and October 2010 when The AP
content was available in Google News in both months. In Column (4), the falsification check
compares November 2009 and December 2009 to test for a pre-trend.

24

We also collect additional data that tests the effects after the dispute was resolved.
Around August 30, 2010, Google News and The AP formally signed a long-term contract
to continue their relationship (Krazit, 2010). Since content is added each day and appears
for 30 days on Google News, we collect data for the weeks in October 2010 when all content
for the past 30 days was fully reinstated and available. In Table 6, Column (2) compares
January 2010 (when no content from The AP was available) to October (when The AP
content was fully reinstated). As expected, we observe a positive effect, as visits to news
sites are higher after the reinstatement of content through a long-term contract.
So far our analyses in this section of the removal and subsequent reinstatement of The
AP content suggest that a “traffic effect” does exist. Consumers do appear to use platforms
to seek new and further content. One striking feature of the way that The AP content was
featured on Google News is that in general as shown in Figure 2 quite a large amount of
news content was shown rather than merely a snippet. This makes the fact we find evidence
of a traffic effect rather than merely a scanning effect more striking.

Robustness Checks

4.1

The Relationship between The Associated Press and News Organizations

As a sharper test of our theory and as a robustness check, we examine whether the traffic
effect was strongest among sites more embedded within The AP ecosystem. To clarify further
institutional details of The AP, recall that news organizations may subscribe to content from
The AP, which they then disseminate on their site. We collect data on the number of stories
featured from The AP on each news site.3 We create a measure AP stories that measure the
fraction of stories from The AP featured on the homepage of the news site. Our measure
is intended to identify which news sites are more likely to be featured alongside the hosted
3

Specifically, for each news site, we counted the number of articles from The AP that are featured in the
top 20 stories on the home page.

25

article and therefore removed from Google News when The AP hosted content was removed.
The measure AP stories reflects the strength of the relationship between the site and The
AP.
Table 7 reports our estimates of equation (1) with our continuous measure AP stories
as our variable of interest instead of the indicator variable N ews. Consistent with our
results on the traffic effect, we find that sites that are more embedded in The AP ecosystem
experienced a drop in traffic relative to Yahoo! News. Columns (2)-(4) check robustness
of the results to alternative definitions of the control group. As described previously, users
navigated to a variety of “non-news” sites after visiting a news aggregator. In Columns (2)
and (3), our robustness checks omit the top international and news aggregators websites
as part of the control group. These alternative definitions of the control group could be
warranted if the removal of The Associated Press content also affected navigation to these
sites directly (e.g., if The Associated Press content had previously encouraged people to visit
international websites) or if the removal of The Associated Press content on Google altered
people’s perceptions of news aggregators. In Column (4), we check robustness to removing
both aggregators and international sites from our control group. In general, the results are
robust in sign and similar in magnitude.
Note that AP stories is a continuous measure, so our estimated coefficients represent a
percentage change in the odds of visiting vs. not visiting a site. Using the conservative
estimate of -0.679, for every one percentage point increase in the fraction of stories from The
AP, the odds of visiting a site fall by 0.66 percent.4

4

We also attempt instrumenting for AP stories by using the age of the media organization. The estimated
coefficients for GLM with instrumental variables is of similar magnitude and sign, though the first stage is
weak.

Table 7: The dispute had a larger effect for sites that featured more stories from The Associated Press.

4.2

The Availability of Content from The Associated Press

We also performed an additional falsification check by comparing downstream traffic to
Google News during two periods when The AP content was available. We expect no difference
in traffic between these two periods, since The AP content was available in both time periods.
We collect additional data for December 2009 prior to the dispute and October 2010 when
the dispute was resolved; in both months, The AP content was featured on Google News.
Table 6 reports the results of the estimation in Column (3). As expected, no distinguishable
effect exists between the two time periods, as The AP content was available in both instances
for the past 30 days.
4.3

Checking for a Pre-trend

As a final falsification check, we use our sample to test for a pre-trend in the data prior to
the dispute. The concern may be that the policy change coincides with a pre-existing trend
in the data. We collected data from November and December of 2009, and we re-run our
analysis with a dummy variable for the month of December instead of a post variable. As
shown in Table 6 Column (4), we do not find evidence of a pre-trend in the months preceding
the contract dispute.
Despite these checks, it is important to remember that there are broader limits exist
to the generalizability of the experiment we study, since we focus on a particular natural
experiment. However, as a single natural experiment, it is reasonably attractive as it captures
the dispute between the second largest news aggregator and one of the largest provider of
news content in the US. This means that even if our results do not generalize across the
industry, the results may themselves be inherently interesting. This is especially the case as
news readership can be highly concentrated (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2011), meaning there
is value on focusing on larger players in the industry.

28

5

Local vs. National Sites

In the previous section, we found that users employ technological advances, such as aggregation, to seek further, more specific information. That is, our results imply that the “traffic
effect” dominates the “scanning effect.” Given the expansion in users’ information set, we
next consider what information do users seek and which types of content benefit from aggregation. Depending upon its content, a site may be horizontally differentiated with a very
local audience or vertically differentiated with a national audience and acclaimed standards
of quality.
Given our finding that downstream traffic to news sites from Google News declined after
the removal of The AP content, we explore which sites were most affected by the removal
of the news content from the aggregator and consequently which sites benefit the most from
aggregation. Specifically, we explore whether the extent of the decline varied by a site’s type
of content differentiation. News sites may be local in news coverage with a readership that
is geographically local, or sites may be national with a broad readership. Tastes for local
news sites vary horizontally, depending upon the consumer’s interest in regional news while
tastes for national news can be vertically differentiated with readers seeking sites, such as
The New York Times, with acclaimed standards of quality.
To identify the extent to which a site’s content is very local or very national, we examine
the top 20 stories featured on the homepage of each news site in our sample, and we identify
the fraction of these stories that are local or national news. We classify a story as “local
news” if the news is specific to the site’s state of headquarters. We classify a story as
“national news” if the news focuses on an area outside of the local state headquarters. Note
that some stories may not fall into either category such as movie reviews, cultural opinions,
etc. To ensure that we properly identify local news stories, we focus on sites affiliated with
newspapers or local TV or radio stations in order to exclude travel or leisure sites that

29

feature local articles, often in the guise of advertising. We classify a news site as “local”
if a majority of the stories featured on the site are local news. We classify a news site as
“national” if a majority of stories featured on the site are national news.
We estimate a GLM equation similar to equation (1) where we include additional interactions between our measures of local and national news sites. We include the main effect
of the policy change on the news category, and we allow an incremental effect if a news site
is local or national. As seen in Column (1) of Table 8, our results indicate that visits to
sites decrease the most for sites that are either local or national. Columns (2)-(4) check
the robustness of the results to alternative definitions of the control group. In general, the
results are robust in sign and magnitudes.
Using the odds-ratio interpreation of our results, the odds of visiting a local news site
on Google News declined by an extra 18 percent relative to other news sites and compared
to Yahoo! News because the exponential of -0.203 is 0.82, thereby one minus 0.82 is 0.18.
The odds of visiting a national news site on Google News declined by an extra 26 percent
relative to other news sites and compared to Yahoo! News, since one minus the exponential
of -0.299 is 0.26.
Our results are consistent with news aggregators reducing consumers’ search costs and
allowing readers to easily find sites that specialize in local news. Local news sites may not
otherwise find an audience outside of their local region. Our results have an important public
policy implication as policymakers enact legislation to encourage the growth of local media,
which is viewed as necessary to encourage civic engagement among the public.
Our findings also suggest that aggregators encourage visits to vertically differentiated
sites such as national newspapers with acclaimed standards of quality. As Gentzkow and
Shapiro (2011) note, news is vertically differentiated with a small number of sites capturing
a large fraction of readers. We examine two pieces of evidence that suggest that these sites
are of higher “quality.” First, such sites account for a disproportionate number of visits. For
30

instance, 25 percent of national sites account for over half of all visits to news sites. Second,
we obtain a list of Pulitzer Prize winners and finalists and confirm that a disproportionate
number fall among national sites. Even though national sites comprise 20 percent of all sites,
they account for the majority (60 percent) of winners and finalists for the 13 categories of
news reporting in 2009 and 2010.5

5

We obtained the list of Pulitzer Prize winners and finalists from the official website www.pulitzer.org.
The categories include breaking news reporting, breaking news photography, commentary, correspondence,
criticism, editorial cartooning, editorial writing, explanatory reporting, feature photography, feature writing,
international reporting, local reporting, and national reporting.

Conclusion

In the first wave of digitization of content, peer-to-peer networks disseminated copyrighted
content, sometimes illegally. Now the second wave of the digitization of content has led to
the rise of platforms which aggregate content in a convenient and unified form for consumers.
The new practice of digital aggregation has led to both lawsuits and uncertainty over the
economic consequences. To investigate the consequences of these disputes, we examine a
breakdown in contract negotiations between The Associated Press (AP) and Google—which
prompted Google to stop hosting The AP content. We find when Google News no longer
hosted content from The AP, Google News users were less likely to visit other news websites
with content related to The AP after visiting Google News relative to Yahoo! News users who
experienced no such removal of The AP content. This pattern was driven by a reduction
in visits to either local or national websites. Consequently, the relaxation of intellectual
property rights may benefit content that is either horizontally differentiated, such as local
sites, or vertically differentiated, such as top news websites with acclaimed standards of
quality.
This is important both for content producers trying to understand the likely consequences
of the rise of these platforms for their business and also for regulators trying to understand
whether regulation of such platforms is advisable. In the European Union, for example, legislators have moved to force aggregators to offer an explicit “opt-in” for all their content. Our
paper offers an explanation for why content platforms have not “opted-out” of aggregators
despite lobbying for laws that require such consent. One possible reason is that ultimately
aggregators may benefit platforms, and the purpose of the “opt-in” provision may be to
increase bargaining power over payments to news providers.
There are several limitations of this paper. First, as we use data at the aggregate level, we
focus on uncovering heterogeneity in responses at the website level rather than the consumer

33

level. Second, as with any attempt at analyzing a quasi-experiment, limitations may exist
both because of the potential endogeneity of actions of agents surrounding the experiment
and also its generalizability. Third, we focus on the aggregation of news content which has
attracted much press, but may have different search and consumption patterns from other
content such as music and movies. Notwithstanding these limitations, we believe this paper
provides some useful first evidence about the effects of digital aggregation on the consumption
of copyrighted content.

Appendix
The following contains excerpts from Experian Hitwise “How We Do It” description on its
official website.
Hitwise has developed proprietary software that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use to analyze website logs
created on their network. This anonymous data is aggregated and provided to Hitwise, where it is analyzed to
provide a range of industry standard metrics relating to the viewing of websites including page requests, visits,
average visit length, search terms and behaviour.
Hitwise is able to combine this rich ISP data with data from opt-in panel partners and with region specific
consumer demographic and lifestyle information.
Hitwise collects aggregate usage data from a geographically diverse range of ISP networks and opt-in panels,
representing all types of Internet usage, including home, work, educational and public access. To ensure this
data is accurate and representative, it is weighted to universe estimates in each market. Because of the extensive
sample size (25 million people worldwide, including 10 million in the US), Hitwise can provide detailed insights
into the search terms used to find thousands of sites as well as a range of clickstream reports, analyzing the
movement of visitors between sites.
Hitwise only extracts aggregate information. No personal information is seen or captured by Hitwise in according
with local and international privacy guidelines. Hitwise’s methodology is audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
on an annual basis.
