Using Samples of Unequal Length in Generalized Method of Moments Estimation

JEL No. C32,G12
ABSTRACT
Many applications in financial economics use data series with different starting or ending dates. This
paper describes estimation methods, based on the generalized method of moments (GMM), which
make use of all available data for each moment condition. We introduce two asymptotically equivalent
estimators that are consistent, asymptotically normal, and more efficient asymptotically than standard
GMM. We apply these methods to estimating predictive regressions in international data and show
that the use of the full sample affects point estimates and standard errors for both assets with data available
for the full period and assets with data available for a subset of the period. Monte Carlo experiments
demonstrate that reductions hold for small-sample standard errors as well as asymptotic ones.

Introduction
Many applications in financial economics involve data series that have different starting
dates, or, more rarely, different ending dates. Settings where some data series are available
over a much shorter time frame than others include estimation and testing using international data, and performance evaluation of mutual funds. These problems represent only
the most extreme examples of differences in data length. More broadly, aggregate stock
return data may be available over a longer time frame than macroeconomic data, cash flow
and earnings data, term structure data, or options data.
The econometrics literature has derived various methods of confronting samples of unequal lengths. An early work is that of Anderson (1957), who derives a maximum likelihood
estimator for a bivariate normal distribution in which one variable has more observations
than another. More recently, Harvey, Koopman, and Penzer (1998) develop a Kalman-filter
approach to missing data, while Schmidt (1977), Swamy and Mehta (1975), and Conniffe
(1985) focus on extending the seemingly unrelated regression approach to cases in which
more data is available for one equation than the other. Stambaugh (1997) derives estimates
of the mean and variance of financial time series, as well as the posterior distribution of
returns, assuming returns are normally and independently distributed, in a setting where
some return series start at a later date than others. Pastor and Stambaugh (2002a, 2002b)
derive Bayesian posteriors for means and variances of mutual fund returns using samples
of unequal length, under the assumption of normality and identically and independently
distributed returns. Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2004) combine a time series of macroeconomic variables with the shorter Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to estimate
the relationship between cross-sectional variance and recessions. They show how to use the
panel structure of the data to infer how the PSID would have behaved over the longer time
span. Patton (2006) derives maximum likelihood estimators for samples of unequal length
when data are non-normal.1
These previous studies take a likelihood-based approach. In contrast, our approach
is based on the generalized method of moments (GMM). We show that our method is

See Little and Rubin (2002) for a survey of the statistical literature confronting missing data problems.
Another strand of literature considers the problem of n independent individuals observed at up to T time
periods, where some individuals drop out of the study (see, e.g., Robins and Rotnitsky (1995)). The
independence across individuals and the fact that asymptotics are derived as n, rather than T , approaches
infinity differentiates this problem from the one considered here.

more efficient than standard GMM and more efficient than introducing the data from the
longer series in a “naive” way. Because it is based on GMM, our method can be used for
nonlinear estimation, and for processes that are serially correlated and feature conditional
heteroskedasticity. We focus on GMM because, as shown as Cochrane (2001), many common estimation techniques used in finance can be seen as special cases of GMM. Further,
many empirical studies in finance explicitly use GMM, such as Harvey (1989), MacKinlay
and Richardson (1991) and Zhou (1994).2 Assumptions required for the consistency and
asymptotic normality of the standard GMM estimator are also required here. We adopt
the mixing assumption of White and Domowitz (1984) as a means of limiting the temporal
dependence of the underlying stochastic process. Intuitively, mixing requires that autocovariances vanish as the lag length increases. This assumption allows for many processes of
interest in financial economics, such as finite ARMA processes with general conditions on
the underlying errors (see Phillips (1987)).3
Because our method is based on GMM, many of our results are asymptotic.4 So that
the asymptotic approximation is reasonable, care must be taken to insure that the missing
data problem does not become trivial as the sample size becomes large. We thus develop an
asymptotic theory that keeps the fraction of missing data fixed as the sample size approaches
infinity. To be precise, if T denotes the length of the longer sample, we say that λT is the
length of the shorter sample, for 0 < λ ≤ 1. We hold λ constant, as T approaches infinity.
This approach has a parallel in the simulated method of moments estimation technique (see
Duffie and Singleton (1993)), where the length of the simulated series divided by the length
of the observed series is assumed to be constant as both series lengths approach infinity,
and also in the literature on structural breaks (Andrews and Fair (1988), Ghysels and Hall
(1990), Andrews and Ploberger (1994), Stock (1994), Sowell (1996), Ghysels, Guay, and
Hall (1997)).
We focus on the case in which some moment conditions are observed over the full range
2
Burguete, Gallant, and Souza (1982) and Hansen (1982) describe the GMM estimator and derive its
asymptotic properties. Hansen and Singleton (1982) derive implications for estimation and testing of financial
models; Brandt (1999) derives implications for the estimation of optimal portfolio and consumption choice.
Newey and McFadden (1994) and Hall (2005) survey work on GMM and related estimators.

Like many of the studies mentioned above, we do assume that the data is missing at random, in the
sense defined by Little and Rubin (2002). Stambaugh (1997) discusses cases where this assumption holds in
financial time series, such as when the start date depends only on the long-history asset returns, and cases
where it does not, such as when the decision to add a country to a list of emerging markets depends on past
unobserved returns on that country (see Goetzmann and Jorion (1999)).

We also verify, in Monte Carlo experiments, that our methods deliver efficiency gains in small samples.

of dates while others are observed over a time span that has the same ending date but a
later starting date because this is the most common pattern in finance applications (we
later generalize this to other patterns of missing data).5 While general, these estimators
are straightforward to implement, as we show in an application involving international data
(Section 2), and have natural and intuitive interpretations.
The first estimator (which we call the adjusted-moment estimator) uses full sample
averages to estimate the moments for which full-sample data are available, and short sample
averages to estimate moments for which only short-sample data are available. Then the
moments for which only the short sample is available are “adjusted” using coefficients from
a regression of the short-sample moments on the full-sample moments. This is reminiscent
of an adjustment that appears in Stambaugh (1997) and Little and Rubin (2002) but here
operates in a more general context. The second estimator, (which we call the over-identified
estimator) uses the extra data available from the full sample as a new set of moment
conditions. This estimator was suggested by Stambaugh (1997) and, in the linear context of
that paper, turns out to be identical to our adjusted-moment estimator (and the maximumlikelihood estimator proposed in that paper). In the more general context of our paper, the
two estimators are equivalent asymptotically but typically differ in finite samples.
In that it is based on GMM, our study is closely related to that of Singleton (2006,
Chapter 4.5). Besides placing the missing data problem within the context of GMM, Singleton also takes the same approach to asymptotics: Namely the ratio of the length of the
shorter sample to that of the longer sample remains constant as the total length goes to
infinity in both his study and ours. Singleton proposes moment conditions that are the
same as those for our over-identified estimator. However, he derives a different weighting
matrix. The weighting matrix that we derive allows us to show that our estimators are more
efficient than standard GMM, and more efficient than a naive approach to using the full
sample. We also depart from Singleton’s study in that we define the asymptotically equivalent adjusted-moment estimator, study the finite-sample performance of the estimators,
and apply them to predictive regressions.
The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 1 defines our estimators and discusses
their efficiency properties. Section 2 provides intuition for the efficiency gains from using the

In its focus on the efficiency results of carefully including additional data, this study has parallels in
studies that focus on including high-frequency data in estimation while accounting for market microstructure
effects (see Ait-Sahalia, Mykland, and Zhang (2005), Bandi and Russell (2006)).

full sample. Section 3 illustrates our methods through an application to international data.
Section 4 presents a Monte Carlo analysis showing that the efficiency gains are present
in small samples. Most of our paper focuses on the case where one data series begins
earlier than another. However, our approach can easily be generalized to other patterns of
missing data, provided that the data is missing in large blocks.6 Section 5 provides this
generalization. Section 6 concludes.

GMM estimators for samples of unequal length

1.1

Definitions

Following Cochrane (2001), assume that the model to be estimated can be expressed as
E [f (xt , θ0 )] = 0.
Here, f is a vector of l restrictions. The true parameters of the model are represented by
the q-vector θ0 . Finally, xt is a vector-valued stochastic process. In what follows, we derive
results based on assumptions that are standard in a GMM setting; see Appendix A for more
detail.
In many applications, it happens that data are missing for the early part of the sample
period for some moment conditions (see Section 2 for an application to international data).

to be available for the full period, and data on x2t are assumed to be available for only
the later part of the sample period. Similarly, we can partition the elements of f into
those that depend only on x1t and those that depend on both x1t and x2t : f (xt , θ) =
[f1 (x1t , θ)> f2 (xt , θ)> ]> . Let f1 be l1 × 1 and f2 be l2 × 1, where l1 + l2 = l.
Let λ denote the fraction of the period for which all data are available. Then x1t is
observed from t = 1, . . . , T , while x2t is observed from t = (1 − λ)T + 1, . . . T . Define the

Under general assumptions on the dependence of the underlying stochastic process, it is necessary that
the number of “blocks” remains fixed asymptotically. This distinguishes the problem we tackle from the
problem posed by data sampled at different frequencies (see Ghysels, Santa-Clara, and Valkanov (2005)).

Sums of f are indexed by the length of the sample. This is a slight abuse of notation
because the subscript λT does not refer to the sum taken over observations 1, . . . , λT . The
subscripts λT , (1 − λ)T and T can be understood as referring to intervals of the data rather
than the ending point of the sample. Figure 1 illustrates the notation.

Formally, λ is a rational number strictly between 0 and 1. Define n0 to be the smallest positive integer
n such that nλ is an integer. We consider partial sums of f of length λT and (1 − λ)T for T a multiple of
n0 . For the remainder of the paper, we let T approach infinity along the subsequence of integer multiples
of n0 . Alternatively, we could define partial sums of length λn0 T 0 and (1 − λ)n0 T 0 for any integer T 0 . The
results would be identical, but the notation would be more cumbersome.

It is also useful to define the matrix of coefficients from a regression of the second series on

Note that S is known as the spectral density matrix.

for a positive definite and symmetric weighting matrix WT . In what follows, we will focus
on the case where the weighting matrix is asymptotically efficient. In the case of standard
GMM, this implies that the weighting matrix asymptotically approaches S −1 . We let ŜT

We call this the short estimator.
Standard arguments show that the short estimator is consistent and asymptotically
normal. However, the short estimator does not use all of the data available. A natural
estimator to consider takes the same form as (2), except g1,λT (θ) is replaced by its fullsample counterpart, g1,T (θ). Because this is the simplest estimator that makes use of all of
the data, we call this the long estimator and let

Stated more precisely, we choose ŜT to converge to S almost surely. Convergence for estimates of
variance-covariance matrices that follow should be interpreted similarly.

6

We will argue, however, that the long estimator introduces new data in a suboptimal
way. We define two alternative estimators. The first takes θ̂TL as a starting point and adjusts
the second set of moment conditions based on sample properties of the first set of moment
conditions. To define this estimator, let B̂21,λT be a matrix converging to B21 . The adjusted

is an estimate of S A , the asymptotic variance of λT g1,T (θ)> g2,T

The difference between (3) and (4) lies in the second set of moment conditions, for which
only the short sample is available. Because
g1,T = (1 − λ)g1,(1−λ)T + λg1,λT ,
A (θ), can be
the second set of moment conditions for the adjusted-moment estimator, g2,T

written as
A
g2,T
(θ) = g2,λT + B̂21,λT (g1,T − g1,λT ).

The expression above illustrates the role of the longer sample in helping to estimate the
second set of moment conditions. Consider for example the case where g1 and g2 are
univariate. If g1 is below average in the second part of the sample, and if g1 and g2 are
positively correlated, g2 is also likely to be below average. Thus the estimate of E[f2 (x0 , θ)]
should be adjusted upward relative to g2 .
Finally, we define an estimator that makes use of longer data sample to add overidentifying restrictions. The over-identified estimator solves

1.2

Asymptotic distribution

Theorems B.2 and B.3 in Appendix B show that each estimator is consistent for θ0 and
is asymptotically normal. Standard errors can be obtained using the same results as in
7

previous work on GMM. Standard errors depend on the derivative of the moment conditions.

For the short, long, and adjusted-moment estimators, D0 is the derivative of the moment
condition evaluated at θ0 . As shown in Theorem B.3, the asymptotic distributions of the
estimators are normal and centered around θ0 . For example, for the adjusted-moment

Analogous equations hold for the short and long estimator, where S A is replaced by S and

each case, the difference between the estimator and θ0 is scaled by λT . This an arbitrary

choice: we could have equally well have chosen T (or indeed any constant multiplied by
√
T ), and adjusted the variance-covariance matrix in (6) appropriately. Regardless of this

choice, it is convenient to keep it the same for all four estimators.
An important practical step in implementing these estimators is obtaining estimates
of the spectral density matrices S L , S A , and S I to substitute into the equations above.
Conveniently, these estimates can be obtained with no more difficulty than estimating the
matrix S because these matrices can be completely characterized in terms of the submatrices
Sij of S. As shown in Theorem B.1:9

Our proposed weighting matrix for the over-identified estimator can be contrasted with that proposed
by Singleton (2006). The weighting matrix he proposes is equivalent to the inverse of the matrix given in
(9), without the λ/(1 − λ) term in the upper left block.

8

These formulas show that it suffices to have an estimate of the original spectral density
matrix S (see Cochrane (2001) for a discussion). Given such an estimate, S A and S I are
easily constructed by extracting submatrices: S11 is the upper left l1 × l1 submatrix, S22 is
the l2 × l2 lower right submatrix, and so on. Such an estimate will generally make use of
the last λT observations, because it is necessary to have all series available. In Appendix D,
we discuss a means of constructing an estimate of S that uses all of the data.
Underlying these results is the asymptotic independence between non-overlapping sam√
√
ples. That is, λT g1,(1−λ)T and λT gi,λT are jointly normally distributed and have zero
covariance in the limit as the sample size approaches infinity. Please see Appendix A for a
formal statement and proof. Asymptotic independence is intuitive: as more and more data
become available, the parts of the non-overlapping samples that are close to one another
become an ever smaller part of the whole. The samples come to be dominated by terms
that are far away and thus nearly independent.

1.3

Efficiency properties

We now compare the asymptotic efficiency of the four estimators. The proof of the following
theorem can be found in Appendix C.
Theorem 1. Assume the short, long, adjusted-moment and over-identified estimators are
defined as (2)–(5). Then
1. The asymptotic distribution of the adjusted-moment estimator is identical to that of
the over-identified estimator.
2. The adjusted-moment estimator and over-identified estimator are more efficient than
the short estimator.
3. The adjusted-moment estimator and over-identified estimator are more efficient than
the long estimator.
Theorem 1 shows that asymptotically, the adjusted-moment and over-identified estimators are the same despite the fact that they take very different forms. The second statement
shows that there is indeed an efficiency gain from using the longer sample. Moreover, it
is more efficient to use the adjusted-moment or over-identified estimators than to use the
longer sample in a “naive” way, as the third statement shows.
9

In contrast, the long estimator, despite its use of all the data, may not be more efficient
than the short estimator. Statement 2 relies on the fact that
#
"
S

12
,
S − S A = (1 − λ)

S12
is positive semi-definite (that is, S is at least as large, in a matrix sense as S A ). However,
the analogous quantity for the long estimator,
"
S − S L = (1 − λ)

S11 S12
S21 0

#

will generally not be positive semi-definite. Thus it is not sufficient to simply include the
full data in the estimation. The non-overlapping part of the sample must be introduced in
precisely the right way to produce a gain in efficiency. The difference between the efficient
estimators (the adjusted-moment and over-identified estimators) and the long estimator is
especially surprising given that, when attention is restricted to estimating f1 (x, θ), the three
estimators are asymptotically identical. In fact, the gains in efficiency occur because the
method uncovers the deviation of g1,λT from zero. Because of the correlation between g1,λT
and g2,λT , the deviation of g1,λT from zero implies that g2,λT is also likely to deviate from
zero. The efficient estimators make use of this information to construct an estimator of the
mean of f2 (x, θ) that improves on g2,λT .
The previous results address the case when the efficient weighting matrix for each estimator is used. Sometimes it is of interest to use a weighting matrix that is asymptotically
inefficient because of small-sample considerations. As the next theorem shows, there is an
efficiency gain for using the full sample in this setting as well. The proof is in Appendix C
Theorem 2. Assume that the weighting matrices approach a positive-definite matrix W .
The adjusted-moment estimator is more efficient than the short estimator and the long
estimator.

1.4

Comparing the efficient estimators

Because the adjusted-moment estimator and the over-identified estimator are asymptotically
identical, we refer to them as the efficient estimators. The above results raise the question
of whether these estimators are identical in finite samples, and, if not, what the differences
are. We answer these questions by deriving the first-order conditions that determine the
10

estimators. For the purpose of this discussion, we assume that ŜTI = S I , ŜTA = S A and
B̂21,λT = B21 . However, the results apply as long as these matrices are constructed using
the same estimated submatrices of S.
As shown in Appendix C, the first-order condition determining the over-identified estimator is equal to

For finite T , however, (10) and (11) will generally not be equivalent. Therefore the values
of the adjusted-moment and over-identified estimators will differ as well.

1.5

The effect of the full sample

How does including the full sample influence the parameter estimates? For convenience, we
consider an often-encountered special case. We assume that the system is exact identified,
and, moreover, the first set of moment conditions (of length T ) is sufficient to identify a
11

subset θ1 of the parameters. That is, θ1 is exactly identified by those moment conditions
available over the full sample. We will call the remaining parameters θ2 .
We first discuss the effect of using the full sample on estimation of θ1 . A natural
conjecture is that the long, adjusted-moment, and over-identified estimators all produce
the same estimates of θ1 , namely those found by setting g1T equal to zero. This is clearly
the case for the adjusted-moment and long estimators. For the over-identified estimator, we
use the argument in the previous section to decompose the first-order conditions as follows:
1−λ >
−1 ∂g1,(1−λ)T

is the first-order condition that identifies θ1 for the over-identified estimator. As discussed
in the section above, this set of equations will in general not be satisfied by the value of θ1
that sets g1T = 0. To summarize, the adjusted-moment estimator gives the same estimate
for θ1 as simply using the full sample. The over-identified estimator gives a possibly different
estimate, one that depends on the point in time in which the second series begins. While
this dependence is possibly unattractive, (14) nonetheless has an interpretation: it is a
weighted average of the moment conditions from the earlier and later parts of the sample,
12

where the weights are proportional to the derivatives, and thus to the amount of information
contained in each part of the sample.
We now ask how including the full sample might effect the standard errors of θ1 and θ2 .
We focus on asymptotic results, so the results for the over-identified and adjusted-moment
estimator will be the same.

> = 0),
Of course, even if the two sets of moment conditions are independent (S21 = S12

the sampling variance of θ2 may still fall because the sampling variance of θ1 is reduced. As
long as d21 6= 0, the first term in (15) is nonzero and there is an effect on the standard errors
of θ2 . Similarly, even if there is no impact of θ1 on the second set of moment conditions
(d21 = 0) the first set of moment conditions help to estimate θ2 if the covariance between
the two moment conditions is nonzero.
Imposing the restriction d21 = 0 allows us to extend the above discussion to the long
estimator. In this exactly-identified case, the long estimator θ̂TL solves
g1,T (x, θ̂TL ) = 0

(18)

g2,λT (x, θ̂TL ) = 0.

(19)

14

It follows that long estimates for θ1 are asymptotically identical to the efficient estimates
for these parameters (they are numerically identical to the adjusted-moment estimates and
asymptotically identical to the over-identified estimates). However, the long estimates of
θ2 are numerically identical to the short estimates, not to the efficient estimates.10 This
follows because the efficient estimates for θ2 solve
g2,λT (x, θ̂TA ) + B̂21,λT (g1,T (x, θ̂TA ) − g1,λT (x, θ̂TA )) = 0
rather than (19). This starkly illustrates the surprising role of the long sample in helping
to estimate θ2 .11 As we illustrate in the section that follows, this surprising result occurs
because the separation uncovers the deviation of g1,λT from zero. Because of the correlation
between g1,λT and g2,λT , the deviation of g1,λT from zero implies that g2,λT is also likely
to deviate from zero. The efficient estimators make use of this information to construct an
estimator of the mean of f2 (x, θ) that improves on g2,λT .

Application to predictive regressions in international data

This section applies our method to estimating predictive regressions for returns in international data. Reliable international data typically begin substantially later than U.S. data.
At the same time, predictive regressions are often measured with noise, making it desirable
to use as long a data series as possible. Our methods allow international data to be used
at the same time as longer US data.

2.1

Data

For the U.S., we use the annual data of Shiller (1989, Chap. 26), which begin in 1871 and
are updated through 2005. Stock returns, prices and earnings are for the S&P 500 index.
The predictor variable we use is the ratio of previous ten-year earnings to current stock
price. We refer to this as the smoothed earnings-price ratio. This ratio is motivated by the
present-value formula linking the earnings-price ratio to returns; normalizing by smoothed
earnings rather than earnings has the advantage that it eliminates short-term cyclical noise
10
L
L
It is tempting to conclude that the lower variance for θ̂1,T
and the same variance for θ̂2,T
implies that the
long estimator is more efficient than the short estimator. This is not the case however. Efficiency requires
L
L
that any linear combination of θ̂1,T
and θ̂2,T
have lower variance than the same linear combination of short
estimates.
11
The result is even more surprising given that the presence of the second set of moment conditions does
not affect estimation of the first set in this exactly identified case, as shown by Ahn and Schmidt (1995).

(see Campbell and Shiller (1988), Campbell and Thompson (2008)). The riskfree rate is
the return on six-month commercial paper purchased in January and rolled over in July.
Because the first ten years of the sample are used to construct the predictor variable, the
data series of the predictor and returns begins in 1881 and ends in 2005. All variables are
deflated using the consumer price index (CPI).
Data on international indices come from Ken French’s website. The raw data on international indices come from Morgan Stanley’s Capital International Perspectives (MSCI).
Fama and French (1989) discuss details of the construction of these data. The EAFE is
a value-weighted index for Europe, Australia, and the Far East: within the EAFE, countries are added when data become available. For each country returns are value-weighted
and countries are then weighted in proportion to their market values in the index. We
also examine results for sub-indices. These are Asia-Pacific (Australia, Hong Kong, Japan,
Malaysian, New Zealand, Singapore), Europe without the UK (Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Netherlands), Europe with the UK (same as previous
with Great Britain and Ireland) and Scandinavia (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden).
Data are monthly from 1975 to 2005. We compound the monthly dollar returns on these
indices to create annual returns. We then subtract changes in the CPI from the Shiller data
set described above from the log of these returns to create real continuously compounded
returns.

2.2

Applying the estimators

Let r1,t denote the excess return on the long-history asset (the S&P 500) and r2,t the excess
return on the short-history asset (the EAFE or one of the sub-indices). We estimate the
predictive regressions
r1,t+1 = α1 + β1 zt + 1,t+1

(20)

r2,t+1 = α2 + β2 zt + 2,t+1

(21)

jointly for S&P 500 and international index excess returns, where zt is the smoothed
earnings-price ratio on the S&P. Moment conditions are determined by
"
#

f1 (xt , θ) =
(r1,t+1 − α1 − β1 zt )

#

f2 (xt , θ) =

where xt = (r1,t , r2,t , zt−1 ),
θi = [αi , βi ]> ,

i = 1, 2,

and θ = [θ1> θ2> ]> . The regression coefficients are identified by the conditions
E [f1 (xt , θ0 )] = E [f2 (xt , θ0 )] = 0.
The system is exactly identified and f1 is sufficient to identify α1 and β1 . Therefore we are
in the setting of Section 1.5. Moreover, α1 and β1 do not appear as arguments in f2 . The
source of the gain in estimating α2 and β2 will therefore be the correlation in the moment
conditions, which arises from the correlation between shocks to r1,t and r2,t , as shown in
Section 1.5. We refer to the two moment conditions implied by f1 as the long-history
moment conditions and the moment conditions implied by f2 as the short-history moment
conditions.

The short estimator is the solution to equations defined by setting (26) and (27) to zero.
This is the same as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression over the 1975–2005 period. The
adjusted-moment estimator requires an estimate of B21 . In this context, this is a 2 × 2
matrix of coefficients of a multivariate regression of errors from the short-history moment
conditions on errors from the long-history moment conditions. To calculate this regression,
we first estimate the system using the short method and evaluate f1 and f2 at the short
estimates. We then have a sequence of observations on the errors for the moment conditions
from 1975–2005. Regressing the errors that correspond to f2 on the errors that correspond
to f1 yields the 4 entries of the matrix B̂21,λT . Given B̂21,λT , the adjusted-moment estimator
is the solution to equations defined by setting (24) and
g2,λT (x, θ) + B̂21,λT (g1,T (x, θ) − g1,λT (x, θ))
to zero. For the long-history asset, this corresponds to OLS regression over the 1881–2005
period. For the short-history asset, this corresponds to a regression over the later part of
the sample period, plus an adjustment which, as we show below, can be quite substantial.
While the adjusted-moment and short estimators are exactly identified, the over-identified
estimator is not, as its name suggests. Moment conditions for the over-identified estimator
are (25), (26) and (27). The weighting matrix is the inverse of an estimate of S I , which can
be calculated based on submatrices of an estimate of S as in (9). Below, we explain how
we estimate S.
Obtaining standard errors requires an estimate of the derivative matrix D0 and an
estimate for the variance matrix S. The results of Section 1 require only that we choose
estimators that are consistent. However, it is most in the spirit of our approach to use the
full data in constructing D̂T and ŜT . A consistent estimator of the derivative matrix D0
that makes use of the full sample is
D̂T = I2 ⊗

1 >
Z ZT ,
T T

where I2 is the 2 × 2 identity matrix.
To construct an estimate for ŜT that makes use of the full sample, we apply the procedure
outlined in Stambaugh (1997) for constructing a positive-definite variance-covariance matrix
for data of unequal lengths. We describe this procedure in Appendix D.

2.3

Results

Prior to reporting the results for the predictive regressions, we briefly discuss the estimates
of the mean returns implied by our methods. The implementation for this estimation is very
similar to, and is less complicated than, the implementation of the predictability estimation
described above. Note that our estimators take the same form as those of Stambaugh (1997)
in the setting of estimating sample means.12
The first two columns of Table 1 report results and standard errors for the short estimator; the second two columns report results and standard errors for the adjusted-moment
and over-identified estimators. Because these are numerically equivalent in the setting of
estimating means, we refer to them jointly as the efficient estimator. As the columns for
short show, the sample mean for excess returns on the S&P 500 in the 1975–2005 period
was 5.64% with a standard error of 3.16%. The sample mean over the full period is 3.96%
as the efficient column shows. It is also estimated much more precisely: the standard error
falls from 3.16% to 1.55%.
Introducing data from 1881–1975 also results in more precise estimates of the excess
return on short-history assets. For the EAFE index, the standard errors falls from 3.79 for
the short method to 3.09 for the efficient methods (the correlation between the S&P 500
and the EAFE portfolios is 0.67). It is this correlation that leads to the reduced standard
errors. In particular, the fact that the mean return for the S&P 500 was somewhat higher in
the later part of the sample than the earlier part implies that shocks during the 1975–2005
period had a positive mean on average. The efficients estimators therefore adjust the mean
excess return on the EAFE downward.
Estimation for the sub-indices also improves, more dramatically for the European indices
and less so for the Asia-Pacific index. While the correlation between the Asia-Pacific index
and the S&P 500 index is 0.43, the correlation between the European indices and the
S&P 500 exceed 0.70. As shown in Section 1.5, higher correlations between the moment
conditions lead to greater improvement for the short-history asset.
Table 2 reports results of estimating the predictive regressions. We show the coefficients
12

In the i.i.d. normal setting of Stambaugh (1997), the estimate of the matrix B21 is comprised of regression
coefficients of the short-history series on the long-history series. This estimate will also be consistent under
more general distributional assumptions, including conditional heteroskedasticity. However, allowing for
serial correlation would require a different estimate of B21 (which could be derived from submatrices of S).
For the current application (which uses annual non-overlapping observations), allowing for serial correlation
is unlikely to have a large effect.

19

on the predictive variable, the standard error on this variable, and the R2 , computed as the
sample variance of the predicted return divided by the sample variance of the total return.13
In the short sample, the point estimates for all the portfolios are positive but insignificant:
t-statistics are below 1 for all portfolios. The R2 values are also small, e.g. 0.6% for the S&P
500. There is more evidence for predictability in the longer sample. For the S&P 500, the
adjusted-moment method leads to an estimated coefficient of 0.093 with a standard error
of 0.038 and an R2 of 4.2%. The over-identified method leads to an estimated coefficient of
0.065 and an R2 of 2.1%.
Well-known theoretical results demonstrate that ordinary least squares regression produces the best fitting regression estimates, given a single series of data. In this predictive
regression setting, OLS is equivalent to our short method. Our results show that one can improve on OLS if one has data on a series for which a longer sample is available. Indeed, this
application shows that including the earlier period of the sample has a substantial impact on
the estimation for the EAFE and other short-history assets. The adjusted-moment method
leads to an estimated coefficient of 0.128, as opposed to 0.073 using the short method.
Moreover, the standard error on this estimate falls from 0.118 to 0.097. The implied R2 is
12%, up from 3.8% when the short method is used. Results for the over-identified estimator are similar: the coefficient is 0.101 with an R2 of 7.3%. Similar effects are present for
sub-indices of the EAFE.
Essentially, our methods exploit the information that the evidence for predictability in
the U.S. is stronger in the full sample than over the latter half. Under the assumption of
stationarity, shocks to returns and to the predictive variable over the latter half of the sample
must be such that the predictive coefficient estimated over this data range is too small.
Because of the correlation between international returns and U.S. returns, OLS regression
for international returns over the same data range would also be likely to understate the
extent of predictability. Thus the efficient estimators adjust the OLS (short) estimate
upward. The resulting estimates have less noise, as represented by the smaller standard
errors in Table 2. While the annual data sample is still too short to comment on statistical
significance (except for the U.S.), it is clear that the economic significance of predictability
is a great deal higher when the early part of the sample is included.
13

For each series, we use the data that are available in computing the R2 .

20

2.4

Efficient versus inefficient use of the full data

Finally, we use this application to contrast the efficient estimators with the long estimator,
which uses the full sample but in an inefficient way. In so doing, we illustrate the theoretical
results presented at the end of Section 1.5.
The results in Section 1.5 imply that the long estimate for the predictability coefficient
β1 is numerically identical to the adjusted-moment estimate and asymptotically equal to
the over-identified estimate of this coefficient. Both the long and the adjusted-moment
estimate are equal to the value obtained from an OLS regression of S&P 500 returns on
the predictor variable over the full sample of data. In contrast, the long estimate for β2
is not equal to the adjusted-moment or over-identified estimate. Rather it is equal to the
short estimate of 0.073 (in the case of the EAFE), which is the value obtained from an
OLS regression of EAFE returns on the predictor variable over the 1975–2005 period. The
adjusted-moment estimate and the over-identified estimate are substantially higher, at 0.128
and 0.101 respectively.
The efficient estimators differ from the long estimator in that they divide the data on
the S&P 500 into two moment conditions, one defined over 1881–1975 and one defined
over 1975–2005. Dividing the data in this way does not alter the estimate (asymptotically)
of the predictive coefficient for the S&P 500. However, this division does create more
information: it uncovers the fact that there is less predictability in the S&P 500 over the
1975–2005 period than over the full period. As discussed in the previous section, our efficient
estimators correctly incorporate this information to improve estimation of β2 .

3

Monte Carlo Analysis

In the previous sections we introduced two methods of implementing GMM with unequal
sample lengths and showed that these methods lead to improvements in asymptotic efficiency. More precise estimates can be obtained both for assets with data available for the
full period and, more surprisingly, for assets with data available for the later part of the period. A natural question is whether these gains are present for the small-sample distribution
of the estimates.
In this section we answer this question using a Monte Carlo experiment modeled after the
estimation of predictability. It is particularly useful to investigate this case in a small-sample
setting, as it is well known that asymptotic properties can fail noticeably for predictive
21

regressions when the regressors are persistent (e.g., Cavanagh, Elliott, and Stock (1995),
Nelson and Kim (1993), Stambaugh (1999)).14
We simulate from the system (20)–(21) using the adjusted-moment regression coefficients
to determine the data-generating process. We augment this system with an autoregression
for the log of the smoothed earnings-price ratio zt :
zt+1 = ρ0 + ρ1 zt + z,t+1 .

(28)

We assume that the shocks are iid and normally distributed. Estimates for ρ0 and ρ1 are
obtained using the full data set and are equal to -0.294 and 0.892 respectively. For each
index, we estimate the variance-covariance matrix of errors from (20), (21) and (28) using
the method described in Appendix D. Table 3 reports the variances and correlations. The
contemporaneous correlation between innovations to zt and to S&P 500 returns r1,t is -0.91:
this large negative value is due to the fact that price is in the denominator of the smoothed
earnings-price ratio. Innovations to zt are also negatively correlated with innovations to
returns on the short-history assets. For example, the correlation with innovations to returns
on the EAFE is -0.515. Innovations to returns on the S&P 500 are also highly correlated
with innovations to international returns: this correlation is 0.65 for the EAFE and over
0.70 for the European sub-indices. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that incorporating
the earlier data period will affect the precision of the estimates for the short-history assets.
For each international index, we simulate 50,000 samples of returns on the S&P 500,
values for the predictor variable, and returns on that index. The sample length for the S&P
500 (the long-history asset) and the predictor variable is 124 years; the sample length for the
short-history asset is 30 years. We repeat the short, adjusted-moment and over-identified
estimations in each. We report both the standard deviations of the estimates (Table 4),
and the bias (Table 5, measured as the difference between the mean estimated and the true
coefficient).
Table 4 shows that the asymptotic efficiency gains discussed in Section 2.3 also appear in
finite samples. For the long-history asset the standard deviation of the predictive coefficient
falls from 0.133 to 0.48 for both the adjusted-moment and over-identified methods. For the
short-history assets, there is improvement in all but one case (when this asset is calibrated
to the Asia-Pacific index). When the asset is calibrated to the EAFE for example, the short
method delivers a standard deviation of 0.156. The adjusted-moment method delivers
14

In contrast, the small-sample standard errors for the means are nearly identical to the asymptotic ones.

22

a standard deviation of 0.134, the over-identified method a standard deviation of 0.135.
When the asset is calibrated to the European index, the standard deviation of the estimate
falls from 0.156 to 0.116 for both the adjusted-moment and over-identified methods. In
each case, the improvement in the small-sample standard errors is of the same magnitude
as the asymptotic standard errors.
The theory presented in Section 1 is silent on the subject of bias. However, it is of
interest to compare the performance of the efficient estimators to the standard estimator
in this regard. It is not surprising that the bias is reduced under the adjusted-moment and
over-identified estimators for the long-history asset. Because these estimators are consistent,
introducing the longer data should result in a lower bias. Indeed, while the bias for longhistory asset is 0.120 under the short estimator, it is 0.028 under the adjusted-moment
estimator and 0.015 under the over-identified estimator.
More surprising is the reduction in the bias for the short-history assets. When the
short-history asset is calibrated to the EAFE, the bias is 0.083 under the short estimator.
Under both the adjusted-moment and over-identified estimators, the bias is about equal to
zero (it is in fact very slightly negative for the over-identified estimator). Similar results
are apparent when the short-history asset is calibrated to the other indices.
While a full investigation is outside the scope of this study, the form of the estimators
gives some insight into the source of the bias reduction. Both the adjusted-moment and
the over-identified estimator use the fact that the standard GMM estimates for the longhistory asset differ between the full sample and the later part of the sample. Because
standard GMM is consistent, some of this difference arises from the bias in the coefficient
(because the bias, on average, will be worse in the later part of the sample than in the full
sample). Given that the moment conditions are correlated, the bias in estimates for the
long-history asset (measured over the later part of the sample) is also likely to appear for
the short-history asset (measured over the same period). The estimators can then use the
information on the bias for the long-history asset to correct the bias in the short-history
asset.

Extensions

In this section we briefly outline how our estimators can be extended to more general
patterns of missing data. We focus on the over-identified estimator which has a direct
23

extension.15
Consider intervals of the data defined by points in time where at least one sample
moment starts or ends. Say these points in time divide the sample up into disjoint intervals
1, . . . , n. Let λ1 denote the ratio of the length of the first region to the length of the entire
sample, λ2 the ratio of the length of the second region to the length of the entire sample,
P
etc. Note that ni=1 λi = 1. Define points t1 , . . . tn so that the first data segment begins at
t1 + 1, the second data segment at t2 + 1, etc. Then
tj +λj T
1 X
gλj T (θ) =
f (xt , θ),
λj T

j = 1, . . . , n.

t=tj +1

For the case described in Section 1, the first segment consist of points 1 to (1 − λ)T , while
the second segment consists of points (1 − λ)T + 1 to T . We adopt the same notational
convention as in Section 1: λj t will refer to the length of the segment between tj + 1 and
tj + λj T , and the segment itself.
Let φi denote the set of moment conditions that are observed in data segment λi , and
let πi denote the number of such moment conditions. Define
fφj (xt , θ) =



>
fi1 (xt , θ), . . . , fiπj (xt , θ) ,

where {i1 , . . . , iπj } ∈ φj and i1 < · · · < iπj . Then fφj are the components of f observed
over the segment λj T . Define the πj × 1 vector

The extension for the adjusted-moment estimator as well as examples for various patterns of missing
data can be found in the working paper Lynch and Wachter (2004).

The In superscript refers to the fact that these are moment conditions for the over-identified
estimator, and that there are n non-overlapping intervals. The T subscript refers to the
fact that the data length is T .16 Let S In be the variance-covariance matrix and ŜTIn be an
estimate of S In . We can then define the extended over-identified estimator as
−1

hITn (θ).
θ̂TIn = argmin hITn (θ)> ŜTIn

(30)

The same consistency and asymptotic normality results go through for the extended overidentified estimator as for the original over-identified estimator. Moreover,

We now state a result analogous to Theorem 1. That theorem showed that including
the data segment for which some data were missing improved efficiency relative to standard
GMM. Here we show that including a new data segment improves efficiency relative to the
estimator that includes all data but this segment. Without loss of generality, we consider
the full over-identified estimator relative to the over-identified estimator defined over the
first n − 1 blocks of data. The proof (available from the authors) is similar to that of
Theorem 1.
Theorem 3. Assume the over-identified estimator θ̂TIn is defined as (30). Then this estiI

Conclusion

This paper has introduced two estimators that extend the generalized method of moments
of Hansen (1982) to cases where moment conditions are observed over different sample
periods. Most estimation procedures, when confronted with data series that are of unequal
length, require the researcher to truncate the data so that all series are observed over the
same interval. This paper has provided an alternative that allows the researcher to use all
the data available for each moment condition.
16

This notation does not, of course, completely define the over-identified estimator. For that, one would
need the points at which the data intervals begin, t1 , . . . , tn . These points in turn depend on λ1 , . . . , λn and
T.

25

Under assumptions of mixing and stationarity, we demonstrated consistency, asymptotic
normality, and efficiency over both standard GMM and an extension of GMM that uses the
full data in a naive way. Our base case assumed that the two series had the same end date
but different start dates. We then generalized our results to cases where the start date
and the end date may differ over multiple series. In all cases, using all the data produces
more efficient estimates. Moreover, the impact of including the non-overlapping portion
of the data is not limited to estimating moment conditions which are available for the full
period. As long as there is some interaction between the moment conditions observed over
the full period and those observed over the shorter period there will be an impact on all the
parameters. This interaction can be through covariances between the moment conditions,
or through the fact that some parameters appear in both the moment conditions available
over the full sample and those available over the shorter sample. In an application of our
methods to estimation of conditional and unconditional means in international data, we
show that this impact can be large.
Our two estimators are as straightforward to implement as standard GMM and have
intuitive interpretations. The adjusted-moment estimator calculates moments using all the
data available for each series, and then adjusts the moments available over the shorter series
using coefficients from a regression of the short-sample moment conditions on the full-sample
moment conditions. The over-identified estimator uses the non-overlapping data to form
additional moment conditions. These two estimators are equivalent asymptotically, and
superior to standard GMM, but differ in finite samples. We leave the question of which
estimator has superior finite-sample properties to future work.

Appendix
A

Independence results

Underlying all our results is the asymptotic independence and joint normality of sums taken
over disjoint intervals. To achieve this result, we rely on an assumption that is standard in
the econometrics literature, namely that the underlying process xt is mixing. That is, let
{xt }∞
t=−∞ denote a p-component stochastic process defined over an underlying probability
space (Ω, F, P ). Let Fab ≡ σ(xt ; a ≤ t ≤ b), the Borel σ-algebra of events generated
by xa , . . . , xb . Consider a function f : Rp × Θ → Rl for Θ, a compact subset of Rq .
The function f provides the restrictions that determine θ based on the observations of xt .
Following White and Domowitz (1984), define
α (F, G) ≡

|P (F G) − P (F )P (G)|

sup
{F ∈F ,G∈G}

for σ-algebras F and G, and

t
∞
α(s) ≡ sup α F−∞
, Ft+s
.
t

The process {xt } is said to be α-mixing if α(s) → 0 as s → ∞. This assumption guarantees
that autocovariances vanish at arbitrarily long longs. Mixing is a convenient assumption
because it allows a trade-off between the speed at which α(s) approaches zero and the
conditions required on the function f . An ARMA process, for example, entails relatively fast
convergence of α(s), and thus requires only weak conditions on f . For a precise statement
of these conditions (which we require to hold for f and its first derivatives), as well as other
standard assumptions (namely, stationarity of xt , uniqueness of θ0 , and θ0 in the interior of
the set on which f is defined) see White and Domowitz.
Define
wt = f (xt , θ0 ).

Stationarity of xt implies that random variables f (x−(1−λ)T +1 , θ), . . . , f (xλT , θ) have the
same joint distribution as random variables f (x1 , θ), . . . , f (xT , θ). Thus partial sums taken
over f (x−(1−λ)T +1 , θ), . . . , f (xλT , θ) have the same distribution as the corresponding partial
sums taken over f (x1 , θ), . . . , f (xT , θ). Define

for scalars a and b. This shows g̃λT (θ0 ) and g̃(1−λ)T (θ0 ) are asymptotically independent, and
therefore that gλT (θ0 ) and g(1−λ)T (θ0 ) are asymptotically independent. The result follows
from (31) and (32).

Deriving the Asymptotic Distribution

This Appendix derives the asymptotic distribution for the four estimators we consider. For
notational convenience, it is useful to define functions hk that give the moment conditions
for each estimator. Besides the assumptions stated in Appendix A, the results in this section
also require that the weighting matrices for each estimator converge to a positive definite
weighting matrix.

Proofs of the theorems in the text

Proof of Theorem 1
It suffices to compare the asymptotic variances of each estimator because the mean is the
same for all of them. That is, it suffices to show that the variance in these expressions is
equal for the adjusted-moment and over-identified estimators, and is smaller (in a matrix
sense) for these estimators than for the long and short estimator. Equivalently, we show

because S − S A is positive semi-definite. A similar argument shows that U > S L U − U > S A U
is positive semi-definite.
For invertible matrices U1 and U2 , if U1 − U2 is positive semi-definite, then U2−1 − U1−1 is positive semidefinite (Goldberger (1964, Chapter 2.7)). It follows that for a conforming matrix M , (M > U1−1 M )−1 −

Estimating the spectral density matrix using the full data
set

Calculating the standard errors requires calculating the spectral density matrix for the
adjusted-moment and over-identified estimators. Section 1.2 shows that these matrices can
be written in terms of submatrices of S, the spectral density matrix corresponding to the
original system of equations. One could estimate S over the short sample using any of the
standard estimators, extract the submatrices and construct S A and S I accordingly.
However, it is more in the spirit of our approach to estimate S using the full data. Define
ŵit = fi (xt , θ̂),

i = 1, 2,

where θ̂ could be any consistent estimator of θ. Let
Ŝ11,T

T

ŵ1t ŵ1t

t=1

35

Note that Ŝ11,T is the White (1980) estimator of S11 . Define


B̂21 =

ŵ2t ŵ1t

t=(1−λ)T +1

ŵ1t ŵ1t

.

t=(1−λ)T +1

Note that B̂12 is the matrix of regression coefficients from a regression of the second set of
moment conditions on the first. Finally, define
Σ̂ =

1
λT

T
X

(ŵ2t − B̂21 ŵ1t )(ŵ2t − B̂21 ŵ1t )> .

t=(1−λ)T +1

Then Σ̂ is an estimator of the residual variance of the regression.
Assuming that the errors are serially uncorrelated (but, allowing for conditional heteroskedasticity),

is a consistent estimator of S.
Of course, ŜT is not the only possible estimator of S that uses all of the data. One
could naively use all the data by using the full set of observations to estimate S11 , but
only the last λT to estimate S12 and S22 . However, this approach may not produce a
positive-definite matrix in finite samples. By contrast (36) is positive definite, as shown
by Stambaugh (1997), who makes use of it in a maximum likelihood context. The result
that ŜT is positive definite and consistent does not rely on the assumption of iid normal
observations. A related question is whether ŜT is an efficient estimator of S. Anderson
(1957) shows ŜT is the maximum likelihood estimator of the variance-covariance matrix
when errors are normal and iid. We leave the questions of the efficiency (and finite sample)
properties of ŜT in a more general GMM setting to future work.

Table 3: Monte Carlo Parameters for Predictive Regressions
Standard deviations and correlations are estimated in annual data for errors from predictive
regressions for use in constructing simulated data. Right-hand-side variables are the US
return, an international index return (EAFE or sub-index of the EAFE) and the predictor
variable, the log of the smoothed earnings-price ratio. Returns are annual, continuously
compounded, and in excess of the riskfree rate. US refers to returns on the S&P 500; EAFE
refers to returns on an index for Europe, Asia and the Far East; Asia-Pacific, Europe,
Europe without UK and Scandinavia are sub-indices of the EAFE. Data for the US span
the 1881-2005 period; data for the other indices span the 1975–2005 period. Predictive
coefficients for returns are reported in Table 2 under the heading “AM”. The coefficient for
the predictor variable is 0.89. Data on international index returns are annual and span the
1975–2005 period. Data on US returns are annual and span the 1881–2005 period.
