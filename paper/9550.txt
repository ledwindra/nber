Labor Market Status of Older Males in the United States, 1880-1940

NBER Working Paper No. 9550

JEL No. J21, N3
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the labor market status of older males in the era of industrialization, focusing
on the question of how the extent of pressure toward retirement varied across different occupations,
and how it changed over time. A comparison of hazard of retirement across occupations shows that
men who had better occupations in terms of economic status and work conditions were less likely
to retire than were those with poorer jobs. This result tends to reject the recent view that retirement
was more voluntary than forced as early as a century ago. The difficulty faced by older workers in
the labor market, as measured by the relative incidence of long-term unemployment, was relatively
severe among craftsmen, operatives, and salesmen. In constrast, aged farmers, professionals,
managers, and proprietors appear to have fared well in the labor market. The pattern of shifts in the
occupational structure that occurred between 1880 and 1940 suggests that industrialization had
brought a growth of the sectors in which the pressure toward departure from employment at old ages
was relatively strong.

1. Introduction
Conventional depictions of aged workers in the early twentieth century display them being
forced out of the workforce, victimized by the consequences of industrialization. Contemporaries
often condemned increased intensity of production, the greater need for formal education, new
managerial practices, and the rise of age discrimination for making older men less useful compared
to younger workers (Squier 1912; Epstein 1928). A Progressive Era reformer, for instance, noted:
It is notorious that the insatiable factory wears out its workers with great rapidity. As
it scraps machinery, so it scraps human beings. The young, the vigorous, the
adaptable, the supple of limb, the alert of mind, are in demand. In business and in the
professions maturity of judgement and ripened experience offset, to some extent, the
disadvantages of old age; but in the factory and on the railway, with spade and pick,
at the spindle, at the steel converts, there are no offsets.1
The "modernization thesis," a popular theory on the transition in the socioeconomic status of the
elderly, suggests that the population aging induced competition between the generations in the labor
force, and that the introduction of modern technology created many new occupations and
transformed most of old ones as well, making aged workers obsolete. As a result, "both obsolescence
and youthful competition eventually create pressure for retirement."2 The miserable economic
conditions of the elderly population was an important basis for the demand for more comprehensive
government welfare programs in the early twentieth century (Armstrong 1932; Epstein 1938;
Lubove 1968).
Consistent with this view, according to conventional estimates, the labor force participation

Cowgill (1974, p. 13). In addition to the pressure toward retirement, it is suggested that urbanization
broke down the extended family, depriving the elderly of important roles and positions of power they used
to have in the family. Also, progressively higher levels of education for the young eliminated a source of high
status of the aged, their superior knowledge from experience.
2

rate (LFPR) of older men remained relatively high until the end of the nineteenth century and began
to decline thereafter, which implies that industrialization presumably brought a dramatic change in
working lives of older men (Durand 1948, Long 1958, Moen 1987a). Also, it had been widely
accepted until recently that farmers tended to stay in the labor force longer in comparison with those
employed in non-agricultural occupations thanks to the flexibility of farming (Durand 1948, Long
1958, Bancroft 1958). This means that the decline in the relative size of the agricultural labor force
would have produced a decrease in the labor market involvement of older men.
This conventional view of the labor market status of the elderly and reasons for retirement
has been challenged by recent studies that suggest a more optimistic portrait of old-age life in the
early twentieth century. According to this revisionist view, the labor market status of the elderly was
not degraded by the impact of industrialization, as previously believed.3 This new interpretation of
the state of economic activity of the elderly is based on evidence that tends to reject the key theses
of the traditional view. First, Ransom and Sutch (1986) reported that the LFPR of older males was
stable at a relatively low level until the enactment of Social Security in 1935. Therefore, the idea that
aged workers were being forced out of the work force is questionable. A number of recent studies
suggested that farmers were no less likely to retire than were non-farmers in the early twentieth

3

Here, I only consider the economic aspect of the debate, although the modernization theory and the
criticisms on it cover a much wider range of lives of the elderly. To give some other examples of the
evidence against the modernization theory: A number of studies demonstrated that the negative
characterization of the old grew from some independent cultural, religious, and intellectual sources, not from
industrialization per se (Fischer 1977; Achenbaum 1978; Haber 1983; Cole 1992). Historical studies on the
family rejected the notion that industrialization and urbanization had brought a discontinuous transformation
in the family structure and household relationship (Chudacoff and Hareven 1978, 1979; Hareven 1979; Smith
1979). It is also suggested that the establishment of public welfare programs in the United States came later
as compared to other industrialized countries in Europe because the elderly in America were better-off and
more independent thanks to high level of savings and other private devices of old-age security such as lifeinsurance and industrial pensions (Weaver 1983; Ransom and Sutch 1987, 1993; Carter and Sutch 1996a).

century (Moen 1994; Costa 1995a; Carter and Sutch 1996a). This implies that the decline in
agriculture cannot explain the fall in the labor market activity of older men.
These new results, in turn, led to a more favorable view of retirement occurring around the
turn of the century. The relatively low labor force participation rates among aged men, Gratton
(1986) maintains, could be explained at least partly as "voluntary action by workers who chose more
leisure and some income over little leisure and more income (p. 96)." In support of this view,
Gratton (1996) reported that real incomes of older workers rose during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries and that family economic strategies promised the elderly considerable security.
Carter and Sutch (1996a) asserted that the retirement pattern in the early twentieth century was
modern in the sense that many men planned their retirement by savings.4
The purpose of this paper is to provide new empirical evidence regarding the labor market
status of older males in the era of industrialization. Although the literature on the economic activity
of the elderly in the past has grown considerably over the last several decades, there is still
inadequate quantitative evidence regarding this issue. In the balance of this paper, I examine how
the pressure toward leaving the labor force at older ages differed across occupations, and how it
changed over time based mainly on two major indicators of labor market status, namely, labor force
participation and long-term unemployment.5

4

The explanations for the secular decline in the LFPR of older males from the late nineteenth century
provided by the two opposing views may also be recast in terms of supply and demand for labor of elderly
men over this time. The traditional "forced retirement story" claims that, given a stable labor supply curve
of elderly males, the demand for their labor shifts inward, due to the consequences of industrialization. On
the other hand, the revisionist "supply-side story" says that, for a stable demand curve, the labor supply of
elderly males shifts inward.
5

Wage is certainly another major labor market outcome that should be useful in addressing this issue.
Unfortunately, micro-level data on wages are limited to only a small number of occupations such as
manufacturing and farm workers for the periods under study. For this reason, I do not consider wage in the
4

This paper is organized as follows: I begin with an analysis of the occupational difference
in the hazard of retirement that the previous studies largely relied on in assessing the nature of
retirement. In order to overcome the limitations of the existing literature, I consider a longer time
horizon, and employ a finer classification of occupations. In section 3, I develop an index of the
degree of difficulties faced by aged workers in the labor market, namely, the ratio of the incidence
of long-term unemployment among older workers to that among prime-age workers. This index is
compared across occupations in order to examine the sectoral differences in the labor market
conditions for aged workers. I also examine whether the older workers were more likely to leave
their jobs if employed in occupations where the disadvantages of aging were greater. Section 4
discusses the implications of the result for the impact of industrialization on the labor market status
of the aged. The final section summarizes the paper.

2. Occupational Difference in the Probability of Retirement
As noted above, one of the key issues regarding the labor-force participation and labormarket status of older males in the early twentieth century is the pattern of occupational difference
in the probability of retirement.6 The most important empirical basis for the revisionist view that
present study.
6

Another key revisionist thesis that the LFPR of older males was stable between 1870 and 1937 has
been disputed elsewhere (Lee 1998). The main source of the disagreement on the LFPR of older men is how
to determine whether an old man participated in the labor force by looking at his gainful occupation (Moen
1987b; Ransom and Sutch 1986; 1989; Margo 1993; Carter and Sutch 1996b). The conventional way of
selecting nonparticipants is to exclude from the counting of the labor force persons who were not gainfully
employed and those whose occupation was recorded as "retired" or a nonoccupational title. Ransom and Sutch
(1986) suspected that some of those who had a gainful occupation, such as men who were unemployed for
a prolonged period during the census year, may have been practically out of the labor force. Moen (1987b)
and Margo (1993), on the other hand, suggested that the long-term unemployed should be regarded as
participants based on the guidelines for census enumerators and the differences in the characteristics between
the long-term unemployed and nonparticipants. For a more decisive test, Lee (1998) examined the pattern
5

labor-market conditions for aged workers are more favorable than traditionally believed is the result
that farmers were more likely to retire than were nonfarmers between 1900 and 1910.7 However, the
finding that farmers were no less likely to retire than nonfarmers appears to be true only for the first
decade of the twentieth century. Recently, Lee (2002) examined the difference in the probability of
retirement between farmers and nonfarmers for a longer period, the six decades between 1880 and
1940. This study found that farmers were indeed less likely to retire than were nonfarmers, as the
conventional view suggests.8 Only the first decade of the twentieth century, the decade from which
previous studies drew their evidence, exhibits the opposite pattern. This peculiarity of the years
between 1900 to 1910 probably resulted from an unusually high appreciation of the value of farm

of labor market transition of older workers between 1900 and 1910, using a longitudinal sample of aged
Union army veterans. The result indicates that the long-term unemployed were behaviorally closer to the
employed than to nonparticipants. Even if we exclude from the work force the maximal number of the longterm unemployed who could have been actually retired, the LFPR of older men exhibits a clear downward
tendency between 1880 and 1940, indicating that a dramatic change in the working lives of old men was
underway in the late nineteenth century.
7

It was noted that "the transition out of employment was most common among the self-employed,
who presumably had some control over their pace of work and the timing of their departure from
employment" (Carter and Sutch 1996a, p. 6). Since the self-employed who were able to choose the timing
of retirement and who were wealthier on average tended to leave the labor force earlier than did other
workers, the reasoning goes, retirement should have been more voluntary rather than forced. According to
the result of Carter and Sutch, within the nonfarm sector, wage and salary workers and the self-employed
were not greatly different in terms of the hazard of retirement. Their calculation shows that the fraction of
men employed at age 55 who left employment before they died was 25.2 percent for self-employed farmers,
21.4 percent for nonfarm self-employed, and 19.8 percent for wage and salary workers. Moreover, the
separate hazard rates of retirement for wage and salary workers and self-employed they estimated could be
inaccurate because the employment status as of 1900 was indirectly determined based on occupation.
Therefore, Carter and Sutch's conclusion is largely relied on the result that farmers were more likely to retire
than were nonfarmers between 1900 and 1910.
8

Lee (2002) also estimated a counterfactual labor force participation rate of older males that would
have resulted had there been no decline in the relative size of agriculture since 1820. The result indicates that
the decrease in the labor force employed in farming accounts for more than 20 percent of the fall in the labor
force participation rate of men 60 and older between 1880 and 1940
6

property during those years which would have stimulated retirement among farmers.9
Owing to a greater degree of flexibility associated with farming and superior economic
status, farmers should have had greater control over the timing of retirement compared to
nonfarmers.10 Therefore, the fact that farmers retired at a later age than did nonfarmers suggests that
older male workers at the turn of the century, if allowed to freely choose the timing of retirement,
would have preferred to stay longer in the work force than they actually did, choosing greater
income over more leisure.11
The above comparison of the retirement patterns between farmers and nonfarmers provides
only a partial insight into the nature of retirement, however. Even among nonfarmers who accounted
for nearly 60 percent of the male population 50 and older at the turn of the century, the economic
status, job characteristics, and employment conditions greatly differed across aged workers
9

The purchase value per acre of U.S. farmland in fixed dollars had doubled between 1900 and 1910
(Lindert 1988). Therefore, farmers' retirement may have been enhanced by the huge appreciation of the value
of their assets. Lee (1999) found that the average farm value of a county had a strong positive effect on the
odds of retirement of farm owners who lived in that county during the first decade of the twentieth century.
Also, farm owners living in counties which experienced a rapid growth in the farm value between 1900 and
1910 were more likely to retire by 1910. On the other hand, retirements of non-farmers were not influenced
at all by the farmland value.
10

If the flexible nature of farming enabled farm owners to retire only when they would enjoy a
comfortable retirement life, the retired farm owners should have been better off compared to non-farmers.
Though the absence of wealth information makes a direct comparison difficult, farm owners appear to have
been better off than non-owners after retirement. The rates of home ownership and the household headship
were higher among retired farm owners than among non-owners. Letting rooms to boarders, a possible
symptom of economic difficulties (Modell and Hareven, 1973), was less frequent among retired farm owners
than non-owners within rural areas. Numerous studies have reported the economic difficulties of the elderly
in the industrial era, especially in urban areas. Reduced family size and diminished wealth, generated by
urbanization over the nineteenth century, are often cited as the source of weakened power of the elderly
compared to the colonial period (Haber 1983; Haber and Gratton 1994). A few elderly people in urban areas
with no means of supporting themselves had to be taken to almshouses (Squier 1912). Economic difficulties
of older parents in the working class often forced children to work from earlier ages (Goldin 1981).
11

For the effect of labor market rigidities on the labor force behavior of older workers today, see Hurd
(1996). The sources of such rigidities include fixed employment costs, the roles of team production, growing
importance of job-specific skills, and conditions for eligibility for defined pension plans and social security.
7

employed in different occupations. In order to examine how people determine the timing of
retirement, therefore, it is necessary to use more narrowly defined occupational categories. For this
purpose, I compare the probability of retirement between 1900 and 1910 across eight occupational
categories, namely, (1) farmers, (2) high-level professionals and proprietors, such as lawyers,
physicians, and merchants, (3) low-level professionals and proprietors such as clerks, salesmen, and
bookkeepers, (4) artisans, (5) operatives and semiskilled workers, (6) manual laborers, (7) farm
laborers, and (8) those whose occupations were unclassified.12
This analysis is based on the longitudinal sample of 3100 aged Union army veterans who
were successfully linked to the 1900 and 1910 censuses and who were gainfully employed in 1900.13
Since retirement decisions would be affected by various factors other than occupation, I conduct a
12

In this analysis, a man is classified retired if his occupation is recorded in the 1910 manuscript
census as "retired," black, a nonoccupational title such as "invalid," " live on pension," or "insane,"
"capitalist" or "landlord," or inmates of institutions.
13

The longitudinal samples of aged males have been collected and linked as part of the project titled
Early Indicators of Later Work Level, Disease, and Death. The primary sample for this project consisted of
35,747 white males mustered into the Union Army during the Civil War, and it has collected military,
socioeconomic, and medical information from several sources on these men throughout their lifetimes. These
sources include military records, carded medical records, pension records, manuscript schedules of the federal
censuses of 1850, 1860, 1900, and 1910, and surgeons' records on medical examinations of veterans. See
Fogel (1993) for details of this project. The linkage process has been completed so far for 28,526 recruits
(about 80 percent of the entire sample) who initially enlisted in companies from the states of Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and West
Virginia. The sample used in this study is composed of these men. Since the information on occupation in
older ages, which is crucial to this study, is collected from the manuscript censuses, the sample is limited to
the veterans who were successfully linked to the 1900 census. Of 10,456 veterans known to be alive in April
1900, when the 1900 census was enumerated, 8891 persons were found in the 1900 census with 8817 of them
aged 50 or older. Among those people 3010 men (34 percent) died by 1910, and 1180 men (13 percent) failed
to be linked to the 1910 census, leaving 4624 men who were alive until 1910 and were linked to both the
1900 and 1910 censuses. If the linkage failures occurred in a nonrandom manner, in the sense that recruits
with some particular characteristics were more likely to be linked to other data sources, it could cause sample
selection bias. For testing the potential selection bias, the effects of various behavioral variables on the
probability of being linked to particular data sources were estimated, employing logistic and linear probability
specifications. The regression results indicate that linkage failures were caused mostly by ransom factors. See
Viechnicki (2002).

logistic regression, controlling for other variables on earnings, unearned income, property holdings,
and family structure.14 As a proxy of productivity in the labor market and economic condition, I
include age, nativity, home ownership, presence of servant or boarder, marital status, literacy, region
of residence, and Union army pension benefits. The dummy variable denoted "pension" has a value
of one if a veteran received pensions in 1900.15 Interaction terms between household headship and
dummy variables of the number of dependents are added to take into account the need for supporting
dependents. Dummy variables of Body Mass Index (BMI) are used as an indicator of health.16
Finally, dummy variable of residing in urban areas is added.17 The result of the regression is reported
in Table 1.
[Place Table 1 Here]
For non-farmers, economic status indicated by occupation is negatively associated with the
relative probability of retirement. In comparison with farmers, the control group, the probability of
retirement was significantly higher for manual laborers, farm laborers and those with an unclassified
occupation, and significantly lower for high-level professionals and proprietors (white-collar I) and

14

Similar regression analyses have been conducted in previous studies using various samples of
Union army veterans including Costa (1995a and 1995b) and Lee (1998 and 1999). However, this study is
based on a much larger sample than those used previously. This large sample size enables me to use a finer
classification of occupations, which is crucial for the purpose of the present analysis.
15

For the histories of the Union army pension, process of pension applications, and decision of the
amount of pensions, see Costa (1998) and Glasson (1918).

BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. It has been found that the
excessively obese and the excessively lean face a greater mortality risk (Costa 1993a; Waaler 1984). More
specifically, the mortality risk remains relatively stable for the medium values of BMI between 20 and 28,
and then sharply rises as BMI goes outside that range. According to this pattern, I include in the regressions
dummy variables of BMI below 20 and above 28.
17

Urban areas include the counties that were classified as Metropolitan areas as of 1900 in the
Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS). See Ruggles and Sobek (1998) for the definition of
Metropolitan areas and the counties included.

artisans. Low-level professionals and proprietors (white-collar II), and operatives and semiskilled
workers (operatives) were not significantly different from farmers in terms of the odds of
retirement.18 Since retirement of farmers were greatly stimulated by the appreciation of farm
property during the decade under investigation, as suggested above, farmers may have been more
similar to white-collar I and artisans rather than to white-collar II and operatives if a longer period
is considered. Therefore, the above occupations could be classified into three groups according to
the probability of retirement: (1) farmers, white-collar I, and artisans with lower probabilities, (2)
white-collar II, and operatives in the middle, and (3) manual and farm laborers with higher
probabilities. The above pattern of occupational differences in the probability of retirement suggests
that men who had better occupations in terms of economic status and work conditions were less
likely to retire than were those with poorer jobs, contradicting the previous argument that the
wealthy self-employed were more likely to leave employment than were wage and salary workers.
Those who were employed in a high-income occupation should have been able to save more
and therefore were presumably better able to finance retirement. On the other hand, job amenities
such as environment, intensity and flexibility of work should have been more favorable for higherrank occupations than for lower ones. These advantages may have allowed an older worker in a
better job to stay longer in the labor force than one engaged in a poorer job. The result of this section

18

Similar regressions are performed separately for each of four regions to examine the variation in
occupational difference in retirement by region. South and West are excluded from the analysis because of
the small sample size for the two regions (147 and 95, respectively). Notable regional differences are found
from the result, as presented in Appendix Table 1. In New England and Mid Atlantic, white-collar I and
artisans were not statistically different from farmers in the odds of retirement. In East and West North Central,
on the other hand, the probability of retirement among manual and farm laborers was not different from that
among farmers. These rather different patterns for the four regions are mixed in the result for the entire
sample: a low probability of retirement for white-collar I and artisans (as found in the Midwest) and a high
probability of retirement for manual and farm laborers (as found in the East) .
10

implies that, in making retirement decisions, it is likely that the effects of employment opportunities
and job characteristics dominated the influence of retirement income in the early twentieth century.19

3. Sectoral Difference in the Relative Incidence of Long-Term Unemployment
Long duration of unemployment resulting from difficulties in locating a new job when
unemployed has often been cited as indicative of a fragile labor market status and a major reason
for retirement of the elderly in the early twentieth century.20 Keyssar (1986, p. 90-96) noted that
though older workers were less likely to be unemployed than younger workers, they had greater
difficulty locating new jobs once laid off. Margo (1993) has suggested that the increased incidence
of long-term unemployment among elderly males was primarily due to the decrease with age in the
probability of exit out of unemployment. Such a disadvantage of older workers was also noted by
contemporaries. Slichter (1917, p. 155) remarked:
Old age is one of the most serious obstacles to finding employment. The loss of his
job by a semi-skilled worker over 40 or 50 is likely to mean a permanent reduction
in his earning capacity, for he will have great difficulty in obtaining a job as good as
his previous one.
The causes of lost days reported in various surveys of industrial workers at the turn of the century
show that unemployment in that period was predominantly involuntary for both young and old

19

The opportunity cost of retirement was probably greater for aged workers employed in a superior
occupations than for those employed in a lower-paying job. This difference may be another factor explaining
why people who had better jobs were less likely to retire than those with poorer jobs.
20

Throughout this study, long-term unemployment is defined as unemployment for six months or
more during the year prior to the census enumeration.
11

workers.21 Deteriorated physical strength and health, obsolete skills and knowledge, and lack of
education compared with younger cohorts are some of the potential factors that may have limited
employment opportunities for aged workers.22 Also, formal or informal discrimination against aged
workers in hiring could also have made it difficult for them to find a new job. In the early twentieth
century, many firms, especially large corporations, adopted a policy of not hiring anyone over some
stated maximum age, the limit being 45 years or sometimes even lower (Durand 1948, pp. 114-16;
Long 1958, pp. 116-71).
[Place Table 2 Here]
Table 2 presents the incidence of long-term unemployment by age and occupation in the
early twentieth century. This table reports the percentage of male workers who were unemployed
six months or more during the 1900 and 1910 census years for three age groups (15-24, 25-44, and
55 or older) and 27 occupational categories.23 It shows that long-term unemployment was a
significant labor market experience at the turn of the century for wage-earners in general. Among

21

According to the surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the late nineteenth century,
the primary cause of lost times was lay-offs. For instance, nearly 70 percent of industrial workers ages 55 and
over who experienced loss of working time in 1889 reported lay-off as the cause. Sickness and accidents were
other major causes of lost days (Carter, Ransom, Sutch, and Zhao 1993a). A similar pattern is found for the
cause of lost days among aged farm laborers in Michigan in 1894 (Carter, Ransom, Sutch, and Zhao 1993b).
22

The Cost of Living investigation by the Federal Bureau of Labor reported that sickness of worker
accounted for about 23 percent of the causes of loss of working time by over 12,000 of wage-earners families
(Lauck and Sydenstricker 1917, p. 113). According to Ransom and Sutch (1995) the days lost due to illness
sharply increased with age after fifty-five among both farm and industrial workers. Gratton (1986, 79) has
suggested, for example, clerks in turn-of-the-century Boston were predominantly young men because younger
cohorts had more education and were more likely to be native born and to speak English well without accents.
23

This classification is based on the occupation codes reported in IPUMS. The 10 basic categories
are further divided into subgroups according to the more detailed occupation codes or geographical region.
In doing so, I select as separate categories only the occupations in which relatively large number of older
workers were employed and combine other occupations into a group, "all other." This is to reduce potential
measurement errors resulting from a small sample size.
12

male workers aged 15 and older, one-fifth had been unemployed for some length in the 1900 census
year and the average length of unemployment for these workers was more than four months. The
proportion of those who were unemployed for six months or longer was 4.5 percent. Although the
incidence of unemployment for one to five months, not reported here, was lower among men aged
55 and over than younger men, the probability of long-term unemployment was much greater for
the older group.24 In 1900, the incidence of unemployment for six months or more (denoted LU55)
was 2.5 times greater than the same measure for those 25 to 44 (LU25). Though the ratio of LU55
to LU25 fell substantially in the course of the following decade, it was still as great as 1.75 in
1910.25 The difference in occupational composition between age groups does not explain the
disadvantage of the old because older workers were more likely than young workers to be in
occupational categories in which the incidence of long-term unemployment was relatively low. If
the representation of each occupation among men aged 55 and over were the same as that for males
aged 25 to 44, the ratio of LU55 to LU25 would have been even greater: 3.84 for 1900 and 2.81 for
1910.26

24

Margo (1993) and Ransom and Sutch (1986) also report that the odds of being unemployed for 6
months or longer in 1900 increased with age holding other individual characteristics constant.
25

The observed decrease in the ratio of LU55 to LU25 between 1900 and 1910 may have been
produced by the change in the definition of unemployment. Instructions for the 1880 through 1900 censuses
directed enumerators to record the number of months of unemployment for all persons; they did not specify
particular reasons for not being at work that would be considered as unemployment. In the 1910 census, on
the other hand, enumerators were instructed to record the number of weeks a person was out of work and
wanted work only for employees, not the self-employed or employers (Moen 1994b). Therefore,
unemployment measures of 1900 may contain some period of voluntary unemployment, while those of 1910
would reflect only the extent of enforced loss of a job.

The hypothetical LU55 that would have resulted if the occupational composition of men aged 55
and over were the same as that of males aged 25 to 44 (LU55*) is calculated from the following formula:
LU55* = 3j Tj25LU55j
25
where Tj and LU55j denote, respectively, the proportion of men aged 25 to 44 who were in occupational
category j and LU55 for j.

For the purpose of the present analysis, we need a measure of the difficulty of finding a new
job when unemployed, which was faced by older workers in a particular occupation. The absolute
incidence of long-term unemployment for aged workers is not completely suitable for such an index,
however, to be compared across occupations. It is well documented that fluctuations in demand for
labor, especially those resulting from seasonality, were important causes of long-term
unemployment for both young and old workers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.27
Therefore, a higher incidence of long-term unemployment among older workers in a particular
occupation does not necessarily indicate a greater disadvantage of aging in that sector because it
could have resulted from a generally poorer labor market condition that affected the young and the
old in the same manner. In fact, variations across occupations in LU55 and LU25 generally exhibit
a similar pattern. The Pearson correlation coefficient of LU25 and LU55 is 0.75 (p-value = 0.000)
for 1900 and 0.87 (p-value = 0.000) for 1910. Both LU25 and LU55 are especially high in seasonal
occupations. Such occupations for 1900 include craftsmen in construction, operatives in textile and
in metal and mining industries, farm laborers in the Northeast, and general laborers. The variations
in LU25 and LU55 for the 1910 census year display a similar pattern.28 In this respect, it would be
more sensible to look at a relative measure of long-term unemployment of aged workers in
comparison with prime-age workers in the same occupation. Accordingly, I use the ratio of the

27

Some examples of industries in which production activities are heavily affected by weather, supply
of water power, or other seasonal cycles are farming, ocean transportation, construction, and iron
manufacturing. In some cases, such as food, textile or shoe manufacturing industries, seasonality in demand
for labor was generated by seasonal variations in the supply of raw materials or demand for the finished
products. For the industrial pattern of seasonality in demand for labor, see Lauck and Sydenstricker (1917,
pp. 137-52), Kuznets (1933), Lebergott (1964, pp. 168-72), and Engerman and Goldin (1994, pp. 111-16).
28

Pearson correlation coefficients for LU25 in 1900 and 1910 and for LU55 in 1900 and 1910 are,
respectively, 0.76 (p-value = 0.000) and 0.60 (p-value = 0.001).
14

incidence of long-term unemployment among male workers aged 55 and older to that among men
25 to 44 as an index of disadvantages of older workers in the labor market.
The magnitude of disadvantages of older workers, indicated by LU55 / LU25, was relatively
great among craftsmen and operatives in 1900. It was particularly high for craftsmen in shoe making
(10.86) and metal industries (6.5), and mechanics (4.59), and for operatives in transportation (6.47).
The same is true for 1910 except for craftsmen in shoe making industry. Aged salesmen, as indicated
by the high LU55/LU25 (4.33), were also much more likely to be unemployed for a prolonged
period compared to the young. On the other hand, LU55/LU25 is generally low for farmers,
professionals, and managers and proprietors.29
This result generally matched well with the list of occupations, suggested by various
qualitative sources, in which the labor market disadvantages associated with aging should have been
severe. For instance, the employment handicap of older salesmen is noted by Graebner (1980) as
follows: "Between 1900 and 1930, salesmen, particularly those over forty, were victimized by
changing definitions and requirement of their occupation. The critique focused on the inability of
older salesmen to adopt the method of modern corporation or to adapt to a changing economic and
technological environment." (pp. 45-46). His study also shows the fate of aged mechanics employed
in printing industry who lost their jobs after the newly invented printing machines were employed.
Aged operatives in transportation industries, especially in the railroad, were often described by

29

There are some notable exceptions. LU55/LU25 is extremely high for farmers in the Northeast in
1900, and relatively high for farmers in the Midwest in 1900 and for managers and proprietors in 1910. Even
these exceptional cases exhibit relatively low values of LU55, however. The disadvantages of older workers
look severe for these occupations because LU25 is extremely low. Therefore, it is likely that this result
indicates an unusually favorable labor market for young workers rather than a poor job market for aged
workers employed in these occupations.
15

contemporaries as being worn out by the enormous intensity of work.30
I conduct the following regression analysis to see if older workers were more likely to depart
their jobs if they were employed in an occupation in which the disadvantages of aging in
employment were more severe, as indicated by a higher ratio of LU55 to LU25 in 1900 (denoted
LU55/LU25). I use two different measures of the rate of losing old workers as the dependent
variable: (1) the rate of change in the proportion of males workers 55 and older employed in a
particular occupation (denoted CPROP55), and (2) the rate of change in the ratio of the number of
workers 55 and older to those 25 to 44 (denoted CREL55). These two measures depend upon the
general growth rate of each occupation as well as the labor market prospects for the elderly we are
interested in. CPROP55 would be higher in a fast-growing occupation if both young and old workers
are newly hired in the course of expansion. CREL55 would be lower in a more rapidly growing
occupation because the newly hired should include more young workers than the old. For controlling
for the difference in the relative growth of each occupation, I add the growth rate of the share of
workers 25 to 44 employed in a particular occupation (CPROP25). In addition, I include the an
imputed index of average income of men employed in each occupation as of 1900 (INCOME) to
take into account the potential income effect on retirement. The values of the variables used in the
regression analysis are reported in Appendix Table 2.
[Place Table 3 Here]
The regression results for six different specifications are presented in Table 3. The results
provide weak evidence that the extent of job severance was greater among older workers employed
30

For example, a contemporary noted: "There is no part of the great national labor machine that wears
out men more rapidly or subjects them to great hazard than that which we call transportation. Especially is
this true of those engaged in the operation of trains and vessels on time schedules, which require by day and
night the strictest attention to duty and rule" (Squier 1912, p. 109).
16

in occupations for which the relative incidence of long-term unemployment of aged men was higher.
Controlling for CPROP25 and INCOME, a unit increase in LU55/LU25 lowered CPROP55 and
CREL55 by 5 percent. The effect of LU55/LU25 on CPROP55 is statistically significant at 10
percent level for all three specifications. Where CREL55 is used as the dependent variable, however,
the coefficient for LU55/LU25 becomes significant only if CPROP25 is included. If both CPROP25
and INCOME are controlled for, it misses significance by a small margin (p-value is 0.113). As
expected, CPROP25 had a positive effect on CPROP55, though statistically insignificant, indicating
that the share of aged workers employed in a particular occupation tended to increase if that
occupation in general rapidly expanded. Also, consistent with the expectation, an increase in
CPROP25 significantly lowered CREL55, implying that the relative share of older workers in an
occupation tended to fall if the occupation grew rapidly. Both CPROP55 and CREL55 were lower
on average in higher-income occupations. This may indicate an income effect on retirement. The
three independent variables employed in the regression explain about 37 percent of variations across
occupations of the two measures of the job severance of older male workers.
To sum up, the magnitude of disadvantages of older workers, as measured by the relative
incidence of long-term unemployment, was relatively great among craftsmen, operatives, and
salesmen in the early twentieth century. In contrast, aged farmers, professionals, managers and
proprietors appear to have fared well in the labor market in comparison with other workers. The
result of a regression analysis suggests that older workers were more likely to leave their jobs
between 1900 and 1910 if initially employed in occupations where the disadvantages of aging were
more severe.

17

4. Industrialization and Labor Market Status of Old Workers
The results suggested above explain how the pressure toward departure from the work force
changed over the period of industrialization. The occupational difference in labor market prospects
for aged workers, as measured by the relative incidence of long-term unemployment, suggests that
the disadvantages in employment of older workers should have been relatively great for salesmen,
craftsmen, and operatives. These occupations will be referred to bad occupations below. On the
other hand, it appears that professionals, farmers, managers and proprietors fared well in the labor
market at older ages, in comparison with other workers (good occupations, hereafter).31
[Place Table 4 Here]
The first question to ask is how the proportion of the labor force employed in each of the
above two types of occupation changed over time. As an answer, the occupational composition of
the male workers ages 50 to 59 is presented for the period from 1880 to 1940 in Table 4. I focus on
the male workers in their fifties, excluding those 60 and older, to eliminate the effect of differential
probability of retirement on the occupational composition. Older workers employed in an occupation
in which the disadvantages associated with aging were greater may have been more likely to leave
the labor force. In this case, the relative size of this occupation would be understated when very old
workers are considered. This problem should not be serious for ages 50 to 59 because relatively few
men left the labor force permanently prior to age 60 until the early twentieth century.
Table 4 shows that the share of the good occupations declined dramatically between 1880
and 1940. Those occupations accounted for 56 percent of male workers ages 50 to 59 in 1880. In
31

Epstein (1928) reached a similar conclusion based on the published census of 1920. He noted: "An
examination of the census data by specified occupations shows that while the aged are still holding their
places among the gainfully employed in agriculture, the professions, independent small businesses and even
public service, they are practically eliminated from all the major industrial occupations" (p. 21).
18

1940, only 35 percent of the male labor force in that age group were employed in those jobs. This
is entirely due to the decline in the relative size of farmers. The percentage of male workers 50 to
59 who were farmers fell from 45 percent in 1880 to mere 18 percent in 1940. Although the relative
share of professionals, and managers and proprietors increased considerably during the same period,
the growth of the workforce employed in these occupations was too small to offset the impact of the
agricultural decline. Meanwhile, the percentage of older workers who were employed in the bad
occupations increased from 25 percent in 1880 to 37 percent by 1940. The share of each category
classified as a bad occupation rose substantially during that period.
The above result suggests that the relative size of the elderly labor force who were employed
in relatively favorable occupations probably decreased over time during the era of industrialization.
Moreover, the labor market status of older workers may have deteriorated over the period under
study even within each category of occupation. Above all, the proportion of the self-employed, who
presumably had a greater control over the timing of retirement, decreased within each occupation
in the course of industrialization. Table 4 presents in parentheses the fraction of the self-employed
among male workers 50 to 59 employed in each occupation for 1910, 1920, and 1940.32 The
percentage of aged workers who were self-employed fell between 1910 and 1940 for every
occupational category. The decline in the relative size of the self-employed was particularly
pronounced for professionals, managers and proprietors, and laborers. For instance, 77 percent of
managers and proprietors and nearly half of laborers were self-employed in 1910. In 1940, 59
percent and 19 percent, respectively, were self-employed.
Furthermore, though speculative at this stage, the pressure for retirement could have

32

The 1910 census was the first census to report this information.
19

increased even within wage and salary workers employed in each occupation. It has been suggested
that the relationship between employers and workers became increasingly impersonal as more firms
employed modern corporate organization and new managerial practices (Chandler 1977; Greabner
1980; Jacoby 1985). Such changes should have "removed the opportunity for intimate relationship
between man and master" (Lauck and Sydenstricker 1917, p. 163) and thus eliminated an advantage
of a long tenure. The influence of ageism or a negative view on aging appears to have become
stronger over time in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Haber 1983). Rapid
technological changes and growth of secondary education should have made it more difficult for the
old to compete with younger cohorts in the labor market.
All in all, it appears that industrialization had brought, at the extensive margin, a growth of
the sectors in which the pressure toward departure from employment at old ages was relatively
severe, and, at the intensive margin, a deterioration in the labor market status of the elderly
employed in each of the nonfarm occupations.

5. Conclusions
This study has explored the labor market status of older males in the era of industrialization.
In particular, I focused on the questions of how the pressure toward leaving the labor force at older
ages differed across occupations and how it changed over time. First, I examined the occupational
difference in the probability of retirement. Recent studies have suggested that farmers were no less
likely to retire than were nonfarmers between 1900 and 1910 (Carter and Sutch 1996a, Costa 1995a).
A look at a longer period, however, indicates that the probability of retirement was greater for
nonfarmers than for farmers in most decades between 1880 and 1940, as the conventional view

20

suggested. Only the first decade of the twentieth century, from which the revisionist view drew
evidence, exhibits the opposite pattern. Such a peculiarity of the decade between 1900 and 1910 is
likely to have resulted from the unusually great appreciation of farm property during the same period
that would have stimulated the retirement of farmers. Further, a comparison of the probability of
retirement across finer occupational categories shows that men who had better occupations in terms
of economic status and work conditions were less likely to retire than were those with poorer jobs.
These results imply that, in making retirement decisions, the effects of employment opportunities
and job characteristics were probably stronger than the influence of retirement income in the early
twentieth century.
Secondly, I compare across different occupations an index of the degree of difficulty faced
by aged workers in the labor market, namely, the ratio of the incidence of long-term unemployment
among older workers to that among prime-age workers. The result indicates that the magnitude of
disadvantages of older workers, as measured by the relative incidence of long-term unemployment,
was relatively great among craftsmen, operatives, and salesmen in the early twentieth century. In
contrast, aged farmers, professionals, managers and proprietors appear to have fared well in the labor
market in comparison with other workers. The result of a regression analysis suggests that older
workers were more likely to leave their jobs between 1900 and 1910 if initially employed in
occupations where the disadvantages of aging were more severe.
Industrialization should have brought a growth of the sectors in which the pressure for
departure from employment at old ages was relatively severe. For example, the share of the male
labor force ages 50 to 59 who were either craftsmen, operatives, or salesmen rose from 25 percent
in 1880 to 37 percent in 1940. On the other hand, the relative size of the occupations that were

21

relatively favorable to older male workers, including farmers, professionals, managers and
proprietors, decreased from 56 percent to 35 percent during the same period, mainly due to the
decline of agriculture. Moreover, the labor market status of older workers could have deteriorated
over the period even within each category of occupation, considering the changes in managerial
practices, production technology, and views on aging.
