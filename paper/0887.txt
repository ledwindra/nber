Post—War Capital Accumulation and the Threat of Nuclear War

ABSTRACT

The hypothesis of this paper is that the performance and, in particular, the rate of capital accumulation of the post—war U.S. economy
has been influenced by the changes in the public perception of the threat

of a catastrophic nuclear war. An increased threat shortens the expected
horizon of individuals and firms, and thus reduces the willingness to
postpone present consumption in favor of investment.
The hypothesis is tested by expanding a standard savings function
estimation technique to include a measure of the perceived threat of

nuclear war. Four alternative measures of the perceived threat are considered, all of which are based on the setting of the clock published
monthly in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists which reflects the editors'
judgment about the likelihood of a nuclear conflict. The tests all support
a large and statistically significant impact of the threat of nuclear
war on the rate of private saving.
These tests are not viewed as conclusive evidence in favor of the
economic impact of the perceived threat of nuclear war. Nevertheless,
this research suggests that economists may have been overlooking an important source of variation in the post—war, post—nuclear U.S.

economy.
Conceivably, it could affect not only the private savings rate but also

such things as the level of investment in human capital, the level of
asset prices, the term structure of interest rates, and the rate of
inflation.

Most economists would not quarrel with the statement that desired
saving by households is potentially sensitive to changes in expected

life span and the ability to leave bequests. After all, life cycle
saving and saving for bequests are two of the most important motives

for accumulating wealth. From this perspective it is notable that
recent attempts to explain variations in post—war rates of capital
accumulation (Boskin, 1978; I-Iowrey and Hymans, 1978) have failed to

consider a potentially significant contribution to changes in expected
life span and the perceived ability to leave bequests

the threat

of nuclear war. Popular perception of the likelihood of a nuclear war
is by no means insignificant. A recent Associated Press/NBC News
public opinion survey found that 76 per cent of Americans believe war
is likely within a few years.-1 Moreover, when asked if, in the event
of a world war, nuclear weapons would be used on the U.S., typically
70 per cent of Americans answer in the affirmative.-' Finally,
in 1963, 89 per cent of Americans perceived their chances of surviving

a nuclear war to be 50—50 or less.-'Apparently, a significant fraction
of Americans take the threat of a life—threatening nuclear war in the

not—too—distant future to be a real possibility. There is also evidence,
to be discussed later, that the perceived threat of nuclear war has

varied quite a bit since the end of World War II. The hypothesis of
this paper is that these changes in the perceived threat of nuclear war

have had a significant impact on the rate of capital accumulation in
the U.S. in the past thirty—five years.

The remainder of this paper is divided into five sections. Section I
develops some simple economic reasoning about the expected impact of a

threat of nuclear war. In Section II, I present a measure of the

—2—
threat of nuclear war, describe a test of the hypothesis, and describe

the data to be used in the test. Section III describes the results
of the test, and in Section IV the plausibility of the estimated effect

is considered. Some concluding remarks are offered in Section V.
I. Savings, Investment, and the Threat of Nuclear War
Consider an individual who dies a natural death at the end of T

periods.-" At the end of the ith period there is a probability p.
of a nuclear war which kills the individual and any of his potential

heirs. If the individual is still alive as of period I , there is a
T
that death will occur at the end of that
probability

period, unless I = T — 1

,

in

which case the probability is unity.

It is assumed that life insurance and annuity contracts written
concerning death due to nuclear war are not available. Also it is not

required that the individual at all times maintain non—negative
wealth, thus allowing the possibility of dying with outstanding

debts. It is, though, required that the consumer have non—negative
wealth if and when he or she reaches period T

.

Under these conditions

the sole constraint on the maximization problem is that

Thus, an increased probability of future nuclear war (that is, a decrease

in q, if j > 1)

has the effect of increasing the effective

discounting of the future. The individual will tend to substitute
earlier consumption for later consumption and thus reduce the rate of

wealth accumulation.—

As the probability of war increases, the expected present

Thus, desired investment at

Straightforward economic reasoning has led us to the conclusion
that an increase in the perceived likelihood of nuclear war would
reduce ceteris paribus, both desired saving and desired investment.
In

the context of an equilibrium model of a growing economy, this

would lead to a reduced rate of capital accumulation. Depending on
the

detail and characteristics of the particular model chosen, it could

also decrease the market value of long—lived assets, alter the
term structure of interest rates, and have other impacts on the state

of the economy. In this paper I have chosen to concentrate on the
possible relationship between the threat of nuclear war and the rate

of capital accumulation. In the next section I begin the task of
investigating whether such a relationship can be detected in the
post—war U.S. economy.

II. Data and Methodology
The approach adopted here is to compare the time series of the
annual rate of capital accumulation with the time series of a measure

of the perceived threat of nuclear war. The choice of this latter
measure is discussed first.
Public opinion survey data seems a reasonable source of information

about public perceptions of the likelihood of war. Unfortunately,
although relevant questions have been posed in national surveys, in
no case has the same question been asked over a long stretch of time since the

end of World War II. There does exist, though, a continually
available series which represents a professionally informed opinion
about the state of international tensions and the likelihood of a

nuclear war. Since 1947, the Editorial Advisory Board of the Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists has printed on its editorial page a clock whose

hands are set at a time approaching midnight. Just how close to midnight
the hands are set represents the Board's judgment about how great the

danger of nuclear war is. When it first appeared in 1947, the clock
stood at seven minutes to midnight. It has since been moved ten times.
It has come ominously close to "doomsday": three minutes to midnight

6—
in 1949, after the first Russian atomic bomb test, and two minutes to
midnight in 1953 in response to U.S. and Soviet development of the

hydrogen bomb. It was then gradually moved back in appreciation of the
thawing of the Cold War and, in particular, because of the Partial
Test—Ban Treaty (1963), the Nuclear Non—Proliferation Treaty (1969), and

the SAlT I agreement (1972). From June of 1972 to September of 1974
the clock stood at twelve minutes to midnight. However, since 1974,
the clock has been moved closer and closer to midnight, reflecting the
intensification of the nuclear and conventional arms races and the
apparent possession of nuclear weapons by a growing number of countries.
The last time it was moved was in January of 1981, to four minutes to
midnight .-i

Although this variable is not directly a measure of the average
individual's perceptions of the danger of nuclear war, it does represent
informed opinion and should therefore be highly correlated with the

general perception. In addition, it has the advantage of being
available without interruption since 1947. The average setting of the
clock for each year beginning in 1947 is given in Table 1.

One problem with using the clock's setting as an index of the
nuclear threat is that, in order to enhance its public impact, the
Editorial Board seems to favor infrequent, large changes in the clock's

hand. Thus, the clock's movements may lag behind the actual changes
in the state of international tensions and also overstate the current

escalation or de—escalation of tensions. To account for this possibility,
a five—year moving average of the clock setting is considered as an
alternative measure of the perceived threat of nuclear war.2-"

Although the clock setting seems to be a reasonable measure of
the likelihood of international conflict, what we are really interested

in measuring is the probability of annihilation due to a war. This
likelihood may be thought of as the product of the likelihood of nuclear

war and the probability of death/destruction from a war. From this
perspective, the clock's setting fails to account for the fact that the
size of the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union (and the United States)
has not remained constant in this period, and the probable destructiveness

of a nuclear war has no doubt greatly increased since 1947. To reflect
this aspect of the nuclear threat, I have constructed an index of the
likely devastation of a nuclear war, which is equal to the estimated
total of Soviet

submarine—based missiles, and long—range bombers.

These estimates are available annually since l947.-' Using these figures,
(denoted WEAP), a measure of the likelihood of destruction due to

nuclear war is formed as (NIN_MIN)

where
WEAPt ,

minutes from midnight the clock is set at in year t

MINt refers to the
,

and

HIN is an

arbitrarily chosen standard indicating no threat of war. This constructed
variable thus increases either when the clock moves closer to midnight

—8—
or the Soviet nuclear arsenal expands. The value of MIN used is 17;
this implies that at the most threatening period (two minutes to
midnight) the probability of nuclear war was three times as great
as in the least threatening period (twelve minutes to midnight).
Figure 1 plots the path since 1947 of the first measure of the
threat of nuclear war, the clock setting, shown as a dotted line.

Measured on the vertical axis is the number of minutes from midnight
the clock is set at; thus, higher values correspond to a lower

perceived threat of nuclear war. Also plotted on Figure 1 is a measure
of the rate of capital accumulation, the ratio of net private saving to

disposable income plus retained earnings. According to the theory,
there should be a positive association between this measure of capital

accumulation and a perceived low probability of nuclear war. In fact,

the two variables apparently exhibit a positive association. Both
start high in 1947, decline and stay approximately constant until 1960.
Beginning in 1960 there is a diminution in the threat of nuclear war

and a concurrent increase in the rate of saving. Both reach a peak
in the mid 1960's, decline sharply in the late 1960's and early 1970's.

Another local peak is attained in both series around 1973. Beginning
in 1974, the threat of nuclear war has increased, while the rate of

saving has steadily declined. Clearly several of the turning points
and local extrema of the two series nearly coincide. The main
disparity comes from the comparison of the 1970's to the 1950's.
According to the clock, the threat of war was lower in the 1970's

than in the 1950's. The average savings rate in the 1970's, though,

was no higher than in the 1950's. However, in those twenty years the
nuclear arsenals of both countries greatly expanded, and thus the
probability of death due to nuclear war wsa no doubt higher in the

1970's than in the 1950's. This aspect of the changed international
situation would be picked up by the constructed variables which
include a measure of the Soviet nuclear capability.

This apparent parallel movement between the rate of saving and
the freedom from the threat of nuclear war depicted in Figure 1 is

tested by estimating a standard savings function. The standard
specification is extended by adding one of the indices of the threat

of nuclear war discussed earlier. The specifications investigated

This is similar tD the specification estimated by Boskin (1978) and
Howrey and Humans (1978)2'. The dependent variable is the ratio of

net private saving to disposable income plus retained earnings. LNY
is the natural logarithm of real per capita disposable income plus

retained earnings)' LNW is the logarithm of real per capita non—human
wealth. (Non—human wealth is defined as the sum of net financial
assets at the beginning of the year and noncorporate and household
capital at replacement cost. The series is taken from }Iayashi (1981)).

In all four equations one of the nuclear war variables has
the expected sign, which is positive for equations (9) and (10) and
negative for equations (11) and (12). In equations (9) and (11) it is

— 12 —

the lagged value which has the explanatory power. In all the equations,
the 95% confidence interval of the appropriate variable does not include

zero. Furthermore, in all cases the magnitude of the estimated effect
of the threat of nuclear war on the savings ratio is large relative to
the average observed ratio and its variation in the post—war period.

Consider first equations (9) and (10), where the nuclear war variable

has the units of a number of minutes to midnight. The estimated effect
(which is the sum of

a5 and a6 for equation (9)) of about 0.0017

implies that a change from the period of lowest nuclear threat in the
post—war period (twelve minutes to midnight) to the greatest threat
(two minutes until midnight) implies a decline in the savings ratio of

0.017, or 1.7 percentage points. This compares to an average post—war
value of 0.102 and a standard deviation in post—war

of 0.011.

Now consider the estimated coefficients of the nuclear threat
variable in equations (11) and (12), which are on the order of 3 x io_6

In 1979, the value of MINE was 9.0 and the value of

WEAPt was 2582.

The estimated coefficients thus imply that an increase in international

tensions equal to a drop of MINt to 4.0 (which is where it stands as
of 1981) would at the current level of weaponry be associated with a

decline in the saving ratio of 0.039. At the 1979 value of

MINt ,

a

50 per cent increase in Soviet weaponry would imply a decline in the
saving rate of 0.031.

The estimated wealth and unemployment effects have mixed success

in meeting prior expectations. The coefficient on the wealth variable
is never statistically significant, and has the expected negative

sign only in equations (11) and (12). The coefficient on the

— 13 —

unemployment variable in all cases has the expected negative sign,
but is significant only in equations (9) and (10).

Several variants of the basic equations (9)—(12) were investigated.

Two are worth mentioning here. The first applied a first—order
autocorrelation connection procedure to equations (9) and (10), the
cases where the Durbin—Watson statistic indicated the presence of

positive autocorrelation. The new estimates were not substantially
different from those presented above. The only change of note is that

the estimated coefficient of PWARt in equation (10) had a t—statistic
of 1.76, making it significantly different from zero with 90 per cent
confidence but not 95 per cent confidence.

The other important extension of the basic equations entailed
adding other independent variables which may be expected to influence

aggregate savings behavior. The additional variables considered
were (1) a demographic variable, the logarithm of the ratio of the
population over 20 which are between the age of 45 and 64, the group

with the highest saving propensity; (ii) the logarithm of the effective
tax rate on capital income in the non—financial corporate

sector',

included in order to pick up variations in the after—tax rate of return
on a major form of investment; and (iii) the ratio of defense spending
to GNP, in order to pick up any interaction between the threat of war,
the level of exogenous spending, and the macroeconomic impact of that
spending. Jhen these variables are added to the basic specifications,
the significance of the nuclear threat variables is not disturbed

in any case except equation (10), where the coefficient of EWARt
while positive, becomes insignificantly different from zero. In the

— 14 —

other

three cases, the magnitude of the estimated nuclear threat

coefficients is not substantially different from those reported above.

The additional variables themselves have mixed success in adding

explanatory power to the equations. The demographic variable is the
most successful, always attracting the expected positive sign and
always significant at least at the 90 per cent confidence level.

However, the tax and defense spending variables are in all cases
insignificant.

These results establish that the apparent inverse relationship
between savings rates and the perceived threat of nuclear war noticed

in Figure 1 survives a standard statistical test which includes other

possible influences on savings. In addition, there is reason to
believe that the regression analysis understates the explanatory

power of the nuclear war variable. The clock setting changed only
eight times during the thirty—two years sample period, and thus

cannot possibly account for "within—an—era" Variations in the

savings rate. A more sensitive measure of the perceived threat would
reduce the measurement error problem and could reasonably be expected
to have more explanatory power and a larger estimated absolute effect.

IV. Are the Results Plausible?
In this section I will attempt to convince the reader of the
plausibility of such variations in saving rates in response to changed

perceptions of the likelihood of nuclear war. First, do people perceive
nuclear war to be a likely possibility over the near future? The answer,
if we are to believe the answers people give in public opinion polls,

is a definite yes. During the fifties and sixties, people were asked
whether they thought there would be a world war in the next five years.
Of those having an opinion, the percentage answering yes ranged from

— 15 —

forty

to sixty—five. Most recently, 76 per cent of Americans said that

war was likely within five years. Also, people were asked whether in
the event of a world war the hydrogen bomb would be used against the

U.S. The percentage answering yes to this question varied between
sixty and seventy—five per cent from the mid—1950's to 1973. Combining
these

responses leads quickly to the conclusion that during this era

it is plausible that between one—quarter and one—half of all Americans
believed

that a nuclear war was likely within the

The proportion who believe it

over the next thirty years must

surely be significantly higher than that.—

These figures establish that nuclear war is considered to be a
plausible event for the near future by a large number of Americans.

The renaming question is whether variations in its perceived likelihood
over the post—war period can explain significant changes in the saving

rate, Of course, the analysis presented earlier above establishes a
statistically significant association. But are the estimated magnitudes
consistent with other evidence about the interteraporal elasticity of

substitution and the degree of risk aversion?
To investigate this question, consider a two—period life—cycle model

In order to judge whether a swing in the rate of saving of 0.017 or more is a
plausible response to the maximum variation in the threat of nuclear

war since 1947, we need to know what a reasonable value of a is
and also we need to translate the variation in the threat of war into

variations in the value of p .

values of a are studied. These values are 0, —.1, and —4, which
imply intertemporal elasticities of 1, 0.5, and 0.2, respectively)'

Similarly, three values of the post—war variation in p are studied:
0.2, 0.1, and 0.05. Note that these correspond to the probability
of a nuclear holocaust before the "second period" is reached, which
may be conveniently thought of as lasting thirty years.

V. Concluding Remarks
The hypothesis examined in this paper, if correct, has far—reaching
implications for our understanding of the performance of the post—war,

or post—nuclear, U.S. economy. It suggests that the threat of nuclear
catastrophe has influenced the growth path of the economy and will
continue to affect the willingness of individuals

to postpone consumption

for the sake of capital accumulation, Such behavior would be a rational
response of a society faced with the changing probability of a limited

future. The estimates developed here indicate that a change in the
perceived threat of nuclear war from its lowest post—war level to
its highest level is accompanied by a decline in the annual savings
ratio of at least 1.7 percentage points, a significant amount compared

to the amount of observed post—war variation. It also suggests that
the increase in international tensions since late 1979 to 1981 may have

I do not believe that the evidence presented in this paper decisively
establishes the impact of the threat of nuclear war on post—war

U.S. economic performance. Much more research is required, not only
concerning aggregate savings behavior,but on other aspects of the

economy. The perceived threat of nuclear war would, if the hypothesis,
is correct, influence the post—war behavior of stock market and other
asset prices, the term structure of interest rates, the rate of
investment in human capital, the mix of investment between long— and

short—lived assets, among other phenomena. At the least, though,
this research suggests that any time—series analysis of these and
sinilar phenomena which do not treat this consideration may be
ignoring a significant factor in the performance of the U.S. economy
since the beginning of the nuclear age.

Barro and Friedman (1977).

This model does not consider other possible respones to the threat
of nuclear war which may offset the tendency to slow the accumulation of

wealth. Two such responses are moving up the planned age of retirement
(or, in general, changing the lifetime pattern of labor supply) and
protecting oneself against the effects of a nuclear war by, say, building
a bomb shelter.

clock is adapted from the editorial in the January, 1978 issue of the

In order to calculate the 1948 moving average, the average setting
in 1946 was assumed to be the same as in 1947.

a variable measuring the after—tax

belief that accurate measurement of this return is impossible. A more

measurable value which affects the after—tax return, the

tax rate on corporate capital income, is included in an alternate

real after—tax return to saving, see Howrey and Hymans (1978) and

reflect the revision of the national income and

product accounts released by the Department of Commerce in late 1980.
The tax variable is the one calculated in Feldstein and Poterba

(1980). Since the tax rate series begins in 1953, this series was
extended by extrapolating the trend behavior to the end of the sample

period. Details of this extrapolation procedure can be obtained
from the author.

Hausman (1979) finds evidence that individual subjective discount

rates are about 20 per cent per year. His

conclusions are based on

a study of household behavior concerning the purchase and utilization

of energy—using durables. Although Hausman does not appeal to the
perceived threat of nuclear war, such high discount rates are compatible
with the evidence cited in the text which document high public concern
about a future world war.
