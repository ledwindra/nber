The Dire Effects of the Lack of Monetary and Fiscal Coordination

ABSTRACT
What happens if the government's willingness to stabilize a large stock of debt is waning, while
the central bank is adamant about preventing a rise in inflation? The large fiscal imbalance brings
about inflationary pressures, triggering a monetary tightening, further debt accumulation, and
additional inflationary pressure. Thus, the economy will go through a spiral of higher inflation,
output contraction, and further debt accumulation. A coordinated commitment to inflate away the
portion of debt resulting from a large recession leads to better macroeconomic outcomes by
separating the issue of long-run fiscal sustainability from the need for short-run fiscal
stabilization. This strategy can also be used to rule out episodes in which the central bank
becomes constrained by the zero lower bound.

“This is the United States government. First of all, you never have to default
because you print the money, I hate to tell you, OK?”
(Donald Trump, May 10, 2016, on CNN)

“Moreover, uncertainty regarding …scal and other economic policies has increased. [...] Participants noted that, in the circumstances of heightened uncertainty, it was especially important that the Committee continue to underscore in its
communications that monetary policy would continue to be set to promote attainment of the Committee’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price
stability.”

Introduction

One of the main legacies of the Great Recession is the severe …scal imbalance that is characterizing many advanced economies. Some scholars have argued that …scal imbalances can
a¤ect both in‡ation and real activity, even in the absence of plain default on government debt
(Leeper 1991; Sims 1994; Woodford 1994.) Whether these e¤ects materialize or not largely
depends on expectations about future monetary and …scal policies. One possibility is that the
government is expected to be able to take the adequate corrective …scal measures to stabilize
the dynamics of debt, while the central bank is credibly committed to keeping in‡ation stable.1
In this case, the macroeconomic implications of …scal imbalances have been shown to be quite
tenuous. Alternatively, the private sector may …nd it implausible that the large debt can be
stabilized by just future economic growth and …scal adjustments. When this type of belief
starts materializing, in‡ation expectations tend to rise because the private sector expects that
in‡ation will ultimately stabilize the …scal imbalance. If the central bank is expected to accommodate this upsurge in in‡ation expectations, the real interest rate falls, causing a temporary
economic boom and a reduction in the …scal burden.2 As the …rst quotation illustrates, this
interdependence between monetary and …scal policies is well understood by policymakers, even
if it is not always so bluntly spelled out.
In both cases that we have outlined, the private sector believes that the two authorities are
working together to implement policies that are coordinated to attain an appropriate in‡ation
rate. Nevertheless, a third scenario in which the private sector expects that policymakers
will follow non-coordinated policies could also arise. Speci…cally, the …scal authority keeps
postponing inde…nitely the necessary …scal adjustments, while the monetary authority insists

In Leeper’s (1991) parlance, the private sector expects that an active monetary/passive …scal policy mix
will be carried out.

Leeper (1991) dubbed this policy mix passive monetary/active …scal.

that in‡ation stability will be preserved, remaining credibly committed to raise interest rates
to combat in‡ation.3 This policy mix is not coordinated, re‡ecting a disagreement between
the two authorities on whether in‡ation should or should not be used to stabilize debt. This
third scenario is still not fully understood. In this paper, we investigate the macroeconomic
consequences of the lack of coordination between the monetary and …scal authorities when there
are large …scal imbalances.
There are several reasons that make the lack of monetary and …scal policy coordination
particularly relevant. Currently, the U.S. public debt is on an unstable path. Figure 1 shows
the projected dynamics of the federal debt as a percentage share of gross domestic product
(GDP) under current law by the Congressional Budget O¢ ce (CBO) as of August 2016. This
picture strongly suggests that …scal sustainability is far from being accomplished. Population
aging and lower expected potential growth contribute to this gloomy outlook. Furthermore,
U.S. debt is at its highest level since the beginning of the Korean War in 1950, suggesting that
economic growth alone is unlikely to be enough to guarantee its sustainability without …scal
adjustments. As of now, no plan has been announced to reduce this severe …scal imbalance.
Given the explosive dynamics of U.S. debt, delaying …scal consolidation will call for more
sizable corrective measures up to the point where the private sector could become skeptical that
such massive adjustments can be realistically implemented. Similarly, uncertainty about the
potential growth rate of the U.S. economy after the Great Recession compounds the problem by

active policies.

making it harder to precisely quantify how large the corrective measures have to be.4 If the U.S.
government overestimates the potential economic growth rate, the …scal adjustment alone may
be considered insu¢ cient by the public, calling for an increase in in‡ation accommodated by
the Federal Reserve. That said, as the second quotation at the beginning suggests, the Federal
Reserve seems committed not to give up on in‡ation stabilization, especially in situations of
high uncertainty about what the …scal authority is expected to do.
We …rst introduce a simple frictionless Fisherian model to review the role of monetary and
…scal policy coordination in determining in‡ation and in‡ation expectations. When this coordination entails that the …scal authority disregards the level of government debt and the monetary
authority de-emphasizes in‡ation stabilization, in‡ation expectations adjust to ensure that real
public debt is on a stable path. This simple model allows us to derive a closed-form analytical
relationship between real government debt and in‡ation expectations. Furthermore, this simple
model proves to be useful in highlighting the key mechanisms at play when policymakers temporarily fail to coordinate. We show that if the …scal authority withdraws its backing from the
monetary authority by disregarding the level of public debt, every attempt at …ghting in‡ation
by the central bank ends up generating even larger …scal imbalances, which, in turn, heighten
the path of in‡ation. This result suggests that the monetary authority cannot control in‡ation
if the …scal authority is not credibly committed to making the necessary …scal adjustments.
Indeed, without a credible commitment to provide …scal backing, any attempt by the central
bank to control in‡ation is not only ine¤ective, but also counterproductive, leading to even
higher in‡ation and an economic slowdown.
We then build a more elaborate model with nominal rigidities by extending the basic newKeynesian framework to include a …scal rule, policy uncertainty, and the possibility of discrete
negative demand shocks that occasionally trigger large recessions and debt accumulation. We
use this model to show that the lack of policy coordination can be highly detrimental. For
instance, if agents expect that the …scal authority will disregard the level of debt but the
monetary authority will insist that in‡ation will not be allowed to rise, the economy can go
through a spiral of lower output, higher in‡ation, and higher debt. When such an institutional
con‡ict emerges, agents expect that in‡ation will eventually increase because of the rising …scal
imbalances. The central bank raises the interest rate to keep in‡ation at bay. However, this
action causes the …scal burden to become larger, inducing agents to expect even higher in‡ation.
In this case, hawkish monetary policy not only is unable to keep in‡ation low, but also has the
perverse e¤ect of signi…cantly depressing economic activity. When this scenario materializes,
changes in agents’beliefs about the resolution of the con‡ict represent an additional source of

A recent article in the New York Times argues that President Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve
have di¤erent view about the potential growth rate for the U.S. economy. See Appelbaum (2017). The Federal
Reserve has continuously revised down its expectations for future growth since the end of the Great Recession
(Leubsdorf 2016), highlighting the high uncertainty about the long-run growth of the U.S. economy.

volatility.
These results should also make apparent why the lack of policy coordination has not been
extensively studied in the context of general equilibrium models such as the one presented in this
paper. As we have explained, a lack of coordination may lead to explosive dynamics for in‡ation,
output, and debt. While explosive dynamics are in principle compatible with the solution of
general equilibrium models, non-stationary solutions are generally ruled out when studying
models approximated around a steady state. Speci…cally, the policy combination that we are
interested in would lead to non-existence of stationary solutions if we were to consider a model
without policy changes, in which the explosive dynamics would persist inde…nitely (see Leeper
1991.) In this paper we make progress on this issue by introducing the possibility of changes
in the policy mix and leveraging the recent advancements in the literature on solution methods
for rational expectation models with parameter instability. These new solution methods allow
for the possibility of temporarily explosive dynamics as long as the system as a whole remains
stationary. This requires checking the frequency with which such explosive regimes manifest
themselves. We elaborate more on this point later in the paper.
We then devote the last part of the paper to showing that the adverse consequences of the
institutional con‡ict can be avoided if policymakers accept to in‡ate away just the portion of
debt accumulated during the large contraction. In this scenario, policymakers concede that the
post-recession debt is likely to be too large to be stabilized by …scal adjustments alone and
they are prepared to accept just enough in‡ation to stabilize the portion of debt resulting from
the large recession itself. Such policy has the important feature of separating the problem of
long-run …scal sustainability from the need for stabilization policies in the aftermath of a large
contraction. We …nd that this strategy raises short-term in‡ation expectations and, hence,
mitigates the recession by lowering the real interest rate. Since the recession is attenuated,
public debt rises only moderately and so does in‡ation given that only a small …scal imbalance
needs to be stabilized. Given that the policy clearly separates long-run …scal sustainability
from short-run …scal interventions, the pre-existing …scal burden does not contribute to create
long-run in‡ationary pressures and macroeconomic instability. Finally, once the initial contractionary shock is fully reabsorbed, the economy naturally reverts to the pre-crisis policies and
macroeconomic outcomes. As a methodological contribution, we show how to model this type
of coordinated strategy based on endogenous targets in dynamic general equilibrium models.
If followed systematically, this strategy is shown to be particularly useful when large de‡ationary shocks cause the nominal interest rate to hit its lower bound. By promising to in‡ate
away the debt resulting from exceptionally large recessions, the proposed strategy works like
an automatic stabilizer that raises in‡ation expectations exactly when monetary policy would
otherwise become constrained by the zero lower bound. In this respect, our work is related
to Woodford (2003) and Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2002) who show that liquid5

ity traps can be made …scally unsustainable. Furthermore, the coordinated strategy that we
propose shares some features with the policy interventions that Chris Sims has advocated at
the 2016 Jackson Hole meeting to replace ine¤ective monetary policy at the zero lower bound
(Sims 2016). Sims calls for central banks “to explain that …scal, as well as monetary policy
should be aimed at meeting in‡ation targets. This means, speci…cally, stating that in‡ation
will intentionally be at least part of the means for …nancing current debt and de…cits.”In fact,
our coordinated strategy can be implemented by explicitly announcing a target for the debtto-GDP ratio that the …scal authority pledges to repay through …scal adjustments. No …scal
plans are instead provided to stabilize the o¤-target amount of the debt-to-GDP ratio, which
policymakers have agreed to in‡ate away.
This paper belongs to a research agenda that aims to understand the role of …scal policy
in explaining changes in the reduced form properties of the macroeconomy. Bianchi and Ilut
(2017) show that the Great In‡ation of the 1970s can be explained in light of a …scally-led
regime. The absence of …scal backing explains the failed disin‡ationary attempts of the 1970s.
Bianchi and Melosi (2013) introduce the notion of dormant shocks that are …scal shocks that
raise in‡ation many years after they occurred. Bianchi and Melosi (2017) show that policy
uncertainty about the way debt will be stabilized empirically accounts for the lack of de‡ation
in the United States during the Great Recession. This paper di¤ers from the aforementioned
contributions in several ways. We focus on the perils related to a lack of coordination between
the monetary and …scal authorities when there is a large …scal imbalance. We emphasize that
the possibility of this type of institutional con‡icts now or in the future can challenge the
central bank’s ability to keep in‡ation stable and represents a serious drag on economy activity.
Furthermore, we show how policymakers can spark an increase in in‡ation expectations and
stimulate economic activity by using a coordinated policy strategy. Finally, we explain how
to build shock-speci…c rules, as a technical contribution. This method is general, and, it is of
independent interest.
Our work is related to the vast literature that studies the interaction between monetary
and …scal policies in determining in‡ation dynamics (Sargent and Wallace 1981; Leeper 1991;
Sims 1994; Woodford 1994, 1995, 2001; Cochrane 1998, 2001; Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe 2000;
Bassetto 2002; Eggertsson, 2008; Reis 2016; among many others). Most of this literature is
focused on the US economy, but Jarociński and Maćkowiak (2017) study the implications of
di¤erent monetary and …scal policy coordination schemes for achieving determinacy of a unique
rational expectations equilibrium in the model that captures the salient features of the Euro
Area. Our focus is on the US economy, but we believe that some of our results are also relevant
for other countries. Del Negro and Sims (2015) argue that when the central bank’s balance
sheet is large and composed of long-duration nominal assets, …scal support to the balance
sheet would be appropriate to allow the monetary authority to control in‡ation. This sort of
6

support is di¤erent from what we call …scal backing in this paper, which is required for keeping
in‡ation stable regardless of the level of the central bank’s balance sheet. Davig, Leeper, and
Walker (2010) study how to resolve the “unfounded liabilities problem,”which stems from the
unsustainable exponential growth in the Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid spending with
no plan to …nance it. They provide a coordinated resolution of this long-term …scal imbalance,
which requires specifying a probability distribution for monetary and …scal behavior over a
long time span. The emphasis in our paper is instead on the lack of coordination between the
monetary and …scal authorities and on how to reconcile the bene…ts of short-run stabilization
policies with the need for long-run …scal sustainability. While Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2015)
study the macroeconomic e¤ects of changes in the magnitude of …scal shocks, we focus on the
e¤ects of uncertainty about the future monetary and …scal policy mix.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce a simple Fisherian model
to study the implications of monetary and …scal policy coordination for price dynamics. The
simplicity of this model and the absence of policy uncertainty allow us to derive all results
analytically. The New Keynesian model with policy uncertainty is introduced in Section 3. In
Section 4, we calibrate the New Keynesian model and simulate the e¤ects of expecting a lack
of coordination between the monetary and …scal authority. The coordinated strategy and its
implications are studied in Section 5. In Section 6, we present our conclusions.

A Simple Model of In‡ation Determination

We construct a simple model to lay the groundwork for how monetary and …scal policies jointly
determine equilibrium dynamics for in‡ation. This model draws from previous studies by Leeper
(1991); Leeper and Walker (2013); Sims (1994); Woodford (2001).

2.1

Deterministic economy

Let us …rst consider a deterministic economy populated by in…nitely many households and a
government. An in…nitely lived representative household has concave and twice continuously
di¤erentiable preferences over non-storable consumption goods. The household is endowed with
a constant quantity of non-storable goods Y and derives utility U ( ) from consuming these goods
Ct . The government issues one-period debt (liabilities) to households that can trade them for
one unit of the goods at price Pt . Government liabilities have purchase price Qt < 1. The
government raises real net surpluses t (net to the returns paid on the debt outstanding) to
repay its maturing liabilities. In symbols, the government budget constraint reads as follows:
Pt

t

+ Qt Bt = Bt 1 :

7

(1)

Market clearing requires Ct = Y in every period and the households’Euler equation implies
the Fisher equation: Qt 1 = 1 Pt+1 =Pt , where < 1 is the households’discount factor.
The two-period case. Let us assume that the households live only two periods, implying
that the government cannot sell new debt in the …nal period, B2 = 0. For a given time sequence
of net real surpluses f 1 ; 2 g and nominal debts (B0 ; B1 ), the government’s budget constraint
pins down the price level:5
P1 =

Q1 B1 + B0

;

(2)

P2 =

B1

(3)

:

Thus, for a given sequence of primary surpluses/de…cits, the larger the stock of debt at the end
of the previous period, the higher the price level in a period. The …nal period’s budget constraint
is particularly illustrative. This equation illustrates that for a given primary surplus that the
government is able to raise in the …nal period, the larger the stock of debt outstanding at the
beginning of the period, the higher the price of consumption goods (relative to government
liabilities/bonds) in that period; P2 . The government is issuing too much debt with respect
to its ability to raise real resources to repay it. Thus, the relative price of the less abundant
consumption goods to the abundant government debt has to go up to clear the market.
The in…nite-period case. We can use the Fisher equation to get rid of bond price Qt in
the government budget constraint. We obtain
Pt =

Pt 1 Bt 1
Bt 2 Pt 1 t

:

(4)

For a given a sequence of debts and real primary surpluses fBt ; t g, the ‡ow government
budget constraint equation (4) determines the equilibrium dynamics of the price level conditional on the initial price level P1 . If one knew this initial price level P1 , one could use these
equations to pin down the equilibrium sequence of the price levels fP2 ; P3 ; :::g. To determine
the price level we need to take an extra step. The transversality condition for government
bonds, which ensures that consumers willingly hold debt, requires the present value of debt
to equal zero.6 Imposing this condition on government behavior results in the intertemporal

Note that the price of government bonds Q1 is determined by the price level in the two periods via the
Fisher equation.

The transversality condition for government bonds is

We rule out hyperin‡ation and hyperde‡ation. Such price processes would imply explosive real balance and
real debt paths that violate transversality.

A higher initial debt B0 or a stream of smaller real primary surpluses f t g raises the price level.
The real value of debt (i.e., its value in terms of consumption goods) is given by the discounted
stream of future primary real surpluses that the government is able to generate. A higher initial
debt B0 must be backed by future higher real surpluses. Otherwise, consumption goods are
relatively less abundant than government debt and, hence, the price level P1 has to go up to
clear the market where goods and government liabilities are traded.
Notice that as long as the real return to government debt is constant (or exogenous), the
link between in‡ation and …scal imbalances stems from the intertemporal budget constraint.
The other model equations do not interfere with this mechanism.

2.2

A stochastic environment with monetary and …scal policy

We now move to introduce a richer setting in order to understand how monetary and …scal
policies jointly determine the price level. Let us assume that the discount factor is a¤ected by
an exogenous process dt that follows an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) zeromean exogenous process: E dt = 0. The problem for the representative household reads as
follows
1
X
t
exp dt U (Ct ) ;
max E0
Ct ;Bt

t=0

subject to the ‡ow budget constraint Pt Ct + Qt Bt + Pt
the household’s problem yields the Fisher equation:
Rt = Et

exp dt+1

t

with Qt < 1. Solving

(6)

Furthermore, we introduce a monetary authority that controls the nominal interest rate on
government bond Rt = Qt 1 by using the rule
Rt
=
R

t

;

(7)

where the starred variables denote the value of the variables at the deterministic steady state.
This equation describes monetary policy and ties the changes in the nominal rate to in‡ation
deviations from its steady-state value. We refer to equations (6) and (7) as the monetary block
of this simple economy.

9

The government budget constraint equation (1) can be equivalently rewritten as
t

+ Rt 1 bt =

bt

1

(8)

;

t

where bt Bt =Pt denotes the real value of the government liabilities at time t.
The government’s ability or willingness to raise primary real surpluses t across periods is
captured by the following …scal rule (expressed in real terms):
= (bt

t

b )+

1

t;

(9)

where t follows an i.i.d. zero-mean exogenous process: E ( t ) = 0. Note that according to this
simple …scal rule, the government adjusts primary surpluses to respond to the previous period’s
real stock of debt. We refer to equations (8) and (9) as the …scal block of the economy.
We linearized the model equations around the steady-state equilibrium. The Fisher equation
(6) and the monetary rule (7) can be expressed as follows:
~t =
R
~t =
R

d

(10)

+ Et ~ t+1 ;

(11)

~t:

The two equations that make up the …scal block can be written as follows:

1^

~t
+b R

^t = ^bt

t;

b ~t;

(12)
(13)

where we use x
e to denote the log-deviation of a variable x from its steady-state value, whereas
we use x
b to denote its linear deviation from the steady state. Note that we linearize the primary
surplus t and the real debt bt around the steady state as these variables can potentially be
negative. In what follows, we always assume that the steady-state real debt is positive (b > 0).
Equation (12) highlights the two key links between monetary and …scal policy. The …rst link
is captured by the interest rate appearing on the right-hand side of equation (12): A monetary
tightening brings about …scal imbalances. The second link is captured by the in‡ation term
appearing on the right-hand side of equation (12): A fall (rise) in in‡ation raises (reduces)
the real burden of government debt. These two links make monetary policy and …scal policy
~ t are multiplied by
interdependent. Notice that both in‡ation ~ t and the nominal interest rate R
the magnitude of the steady-state stock of real debt b in equation (12). Therefore, the larger
the average value of …scal imbalances, the stronger the degree of interdependence between
monetary and …scal policy. As argued in the introduction, policymakers are aware of this

10

interdependence. As we shall see, these links play a central role in determining whether there
exists a unique stable rational expectations equilibrium (determinacy), or in…nitely many of
them (indeterminacy), or none of them in our simple model.
Plugging the monetary rule (11) into the Fisher equation (10) yields the following equation:
~t =

d
t

(14)

+ Et ~ t+1 ;

which we will refer to as the monetary-block equation. Furthermore, combining equation (12)
with the …scal rule (13) and the monetary rule (11) yields
^bt =

^bt

+b

~t

(15)

t;

which we will refer to as the …scal-block equation. Notice that whether higher in‡ation reduces
or increases the real stock of debt primarily depends on how strongly the monetary authority
responds to in‡ation ( ). In‡ation raises real debt if the central bank aggressively raises the
1
interest rate in response to in‡ation deviations from the target ( >
). This rise in the
interest rate ends up increasing the …scal burden by making its serving cost larger via the …rst
link that we discussed when presenting equation (12). This is an important point to which we
will return.
De…ning the rational expectations errors t ~ t Et 1 ~ t and replacing ~ t with Et 1 ~ t + t
in both equations (14)-(15) yield the following system of linear equations:

This system has two eigenvalues:
and
. There is only one non-predetermined
1
variable (Et ~ t+1 ). Since the second eigenvalue lies outside the unit circle if <
1, our
exercise con…rms the partition of the parameter space introduced by Leeper (1991): The two
policy parameters and determine these eigenvalues and, hence, the existence and uniqueness
of a stable rational expectations equilibrium for this Fisherian economy. Let us review the four
possible cases.

Monetary-Led Policy Mix. Suppose that the monetary authority conducts an active
monetary policy by aggressively adjusting the interest rate to stabilize in‡ation. This policy is
captured by setting > 1 in the monetary policy rule (7). Furthermore, let us assume that
the government is committed to generate enough primary surpluses so as to stabilize the real
stock of debt ^bt . This goal is achieved by assuming that the …scal authority adjusts primary
11

surpluses to debt ‡uctuations in a way to guarantee that debt always remains on a stable path.
1
More precisely, if the …scal policy parameter is larger than 1 1, then the root
in the …scal-block equation (15) is lower than one, which implies stationary dynamics for the
real debt ^bt . When policymakers follow this policy mix, there exists a unique stable rational
expectations equilibrium.7
It should be noted that this kind of monetary and …scal policy interactions leads policymakers to coordinate their policies in a countercyclical manner. As an in‡ationary shock (e.g.,
d
t > 0) hits the economy, the central bank aggressively raises the interest rate. This aggressive monetary contraction leads to an increase in the debt service costs (^{t ) - equation (15) and hence to a …scal imbalance. The …scal rule implies that the …scal authority raises taxes
aggressively ( > 1 1) to make sure that the higher real stock of debt will be reabsorbed.
The opposite happens after a de‡ationary shock. We call this form of interaction monetaryled policy mix meaning that the monetary authority is the leading authority, while the …scal
authority accommodates monetary policy decisions by adjusting primary surpluses in a way to
keep debt on a stable path.
In our simple setting it is possible to characterize analytically the unique rational expectations equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the law of motion for in‡ation is as follows:
1 d
t:

~t =

(17)

Combining this result with the …scal-block equation (15) delivers the equilibrium law of motion
of real debt ^bt .
Equation (17) reveals an important property of this equilibrium: …scal shocks t do not
a¤ect in‡ation; they only a¤ect …scal variables (i.e., debt and primary surpluses). Since the
…scal authority is committed to systematically adjusting the stream of primary surpluses to
repay its debt, in‡ation is completely insulated from the …scal block and …scal imbalances are
never relevant for in‡ation determination. We call this feature Monetary and Fiscal Dichotomy.
Again, the Dichotomy requires to assume that (i) the central bank strives to stabilize in‡ation,
(ii) the government is committed to raise taxes to stabilize debt, and (iii) agents believe that
policymakers will carry out these policies in every state of the world.
Fiscally-Led Policy Mix. Now suppose that the government is not committed to raise
enough primary surpluses so as to guarantee …scal sustainability. This scenario is captured by
setting the …scal policy parameter in the …scal rule (9) strictly lower than the steady-state value
1
of the net real rate
1 . Furthermore, we assume that the monetary authority conducts a

is captured by setting
1 in the monetary policy rule (7). Now the root
in the
…scal-block equation (15) is larger than one, which implies that the government is not taking
the necessary …scal adjustments to stabilize the debt. Therefore, when debt deviates from its
value of steady state, agents want to sell government liabilities in exchange for consumption
goods. They understand that the government will not repay debt with consumption goods.
Consequently, the price of consumption goods must go up to clear the market.
However, for this scenario to be consistent with a stable equilibrium, the behavior of the
central bank plays a key role. By responding to in‡ation less than one to one, the central
bank accommodates the price adjustment that is necessary to stabilize the dynamics of real
debt.8 As a result, the dynamics of the forward-looking variable (i.e., in‡ation expectations)
are pinned down by the need for making real debt stationary. Hence, there exists a unique
stable rational expectations equilibrium. In this simple framework, the relationship between
in‡ation expectations and the deviations of real debt from its steady state can be analytically
characterized:9

This equation quanti…es by how much in‡ation expectations have to adjust to keep real debt
on a stable path and to ensure the uniqueness of the stable rational expectations equilibria.
Furthermore, this equation is quite revealing about the interplay between monetary and …scal
policies. The active …scal authority can disregard the level of debt because the passive monetary
authority allows in‡ation to rise to stabilize ‡uctuations in the real value of debt. We call this
policy mix …scally-led policy mix. Quite clearly, equation (18) breaks down the Monetary and
Fiscal Dichotomy. Now in‡ation is no longer insulated from …scal developments.
The rational expectation equilibrium (REE) can be characterized by plugging equation (18)
into the monetary-block equation (14) to get rid of in‡ation expectations. We obtain

Two features of the solution (20) are worthy emphasizing. First, as already noticed, in‡ation
is generally not insulated from …scal shocks t under this alternative policy mix. Second, the
central bank’s systematic response to in‡ation ( ) induces the dynamics of debt and, hence,
in‡ation to become persistent. This is strikingly di¤erent from the monetary-led case, in which
in‡ation follows an i.i.d. process. Notice that this simple Fisherian model features only i.i.d.
shocks. The persistent dynamics of in‡ation under the …scally-led policy mix entirely stem
from monetary contractions in response to in‡ation that occur so long as > 0. These timid
monetary contractions end up slowing down the in‡ation-driven reduction in the real value
of debt and, in doing so, raise the amount of in‡ation that is necessary for stabilizing debt,
everything else being equal.
Passive Monetary and Fiscal Policies. So far we have considered situations in which
policies are coordinated, in the sense that they are conducive to a unique equilibrium. These
situations always re‡ect an explicit or implicit agreement between the monetary and …scal
authorities about the appropriate path of in‡ation and debt in every state of the world. In
what follows, we are going to consider the possibility of a lack of coordination between the two
authorities. By this we mean a situation in which the two authorities follow policies that are
not conducive to a unique path for in‡ation and real debt.
The …rst possibility we consider is that both authorities engage in passive policies. This
means that the monetary authority disapplies the Taylor principle (
1) and the …scal
1
authority adjusts the stream of future primary surpluses to stabilize debt (
1). This
policy mix is not coordinated because monetary policy fails to anchor in‡ation expectations
while …scal policy does not require in‡ation to reabsorb …scal imbalances, which are addressed
by raising primary surpluses. As a result, in‡ation is indeterminate; that is, there exist in…nitely
many stable paths for in‡ation that are consistent with the concept of rational expectations
equilibrium.

2.3

Lack of Coordination and Policy Changes

Let us now consider the case that is the focus of this paper. Suppose that the central bank
applies the Taylor principle ( > 1) and that the …scal authority disregards the level of debt
1
( <
1). In this case, monetary and …scal policies are not coordinated in the sense
10

A detailed derivation is in Appendix A.

14

that monetary and …scal policies are not geared toward the determination of the in‡ation
rate. Rather, the two policy authorities are in a sort of con‡ict to control in‡ation: the lack
of response of the …scal authority to the level of debt would call for debt stabilization via
in‡ation, whereas the central bank adjusts the interest rate aggressively to prevent in‡ation
from deviating from its steady-state (target) level. These two policies are clearly inconsistent. If
this lack of coordination were to persist inde…nitely, no stable rational expectations equilibrium
would exist. However, this policy mix is still consistent with a stable equilibrium if it is not
perceived to be permanent. In what follows, we use the simple Fisherian model to study
the macroeconomic implications of a situation in which both monetary and …scal authorities
conduct active policies in a struggle to control in‡ation.
We assume that the economy is at its steady-state equilibrium when at time t = 1, it
is hit by a positive discount factor shock, dt > 0. At this point, the …scal authority starts
disregarding the level of debt
= A < 1 1 while the monetary authority is conducting
an active policy ( = A > 1). We can interpret this policy mix with both authorities active
as a situation in which there is con‡ict over the in‡ation rate. On the one hand, the central
bank wants to secure full control over in‡ation, preventing …scal imbalances from having any
e¤ects on in‡ation dynamics. On the other hand, the …scal authority wants the central bank
to let in‡ation adjust so as to stabilize its real debt.
We assume that one of the two authorities will eventually have to concede the control of
in‡ation in period t = 2 and revert to the passive policy. We consider two cases: one in which
1
the monetary authority wins ( = A > 1 and = P >
1 in period t = 2) and the
other in which the …scal authority eventually prevails ( = P < 1 and = A < 1 1 in
period t = 2). To make our analysis as simple as possible, we assume that agents know with
certainty what policy mix is adopted by policymakers at time t = 1 and in every subsequent
period. Later on we will relax this assumption.
Case 1 Con‡ict and Monetary-Led Resolution In this case, the monetary authority is
not adjusting its behavior in response to the …scal authority’s decision to withdraw its …scal
backing. In period t = 2, the …scal authority will revert to passive …scal policy. This case is
illustrative of a situation in which agents expect that after the initial period of con‡ict with the
…scal authority, the central bank will succeed in securing …scal backing, a necessary condition
for controlling in‡ation.
At time t = 1; agents anticipate that policymakers will eventually coordinate their policies
in line with the monetary-led policy mix and hence, at time t = 2 in‡ation will depend only
on future shocks (see equation (17).) Since the discount factor shock is i.i.d., it follows that
E1 ~ 2 = 0. Consequently, REE in‡ation at time 1 is given by ~ 1 = A1 d1 > 0. Since the real
debt is at steady state at time t = 0, plugging the equilibrium in‡ation rate at time t = 1 into
15

1
1
d
the …scal-block equation (15) yields the real debt at time t = 1, which is ^b1 = b 1
1.
A
Notice that …scal authority’s actions have no implications whatsoever for REE outcomes in
period 1. Agents understand that the …scal authority has withdrawn its backing only in the
short term and soon it will revert to passive policy. Importantly, the …scal imbalance that arises
in period 1 does not in‡uence the dynamics of in‡ation at time t = 1 and in any subsequent
period. The stronger the monetary authority responds to in‡ation (i.e., the higher A ), the
lower in‡ation in period 1. A proactive central bank will induce a larger …scal imbalance,
requiring the government to raise taxes more aggressively from period 2 onward. When the
1
central bank’s response to in‡ation is su¢ ciently strong, A >
1, real debt responds
positively to the in‡ationary shock. This result is due to the …scal e¤ects of the contractionary
monetary policy conducted in the …rst period.

Case 2: Con‡ict and Fiscally-Led Resolution In this case, policymakers compete for
to gain full control over how to determine the rate of in‡ation in the …rst period, but unlike
in case 1, the …scal authority is expected to emerge victorious. This case sheds light on what
happens when the central bank …ghts back against the …scal authority’s decision to remove its
support for stabilizing in‡ation, but agents expect that …scal backing will not be secured in the
long run.
At time t = 1; agents know that policymakers will coordinate over their policies in line with
the Fiscally-led policy mix, and hence, they expect that E1 ^ 2 = ^b1 . Consequently, at time
t = 1, the REE in‡ation must satisfy

Figure 2: Con‡ict and Fiscally-led Resolution. Response of in‡ation and real debt to a discount factor shock
for di¤erent central bank’s responses to in‡ation in period 1 (di¤erent lines, see the legend) and from period 2
on (left panels P = 0 and right panels P = 0:5). Fiscal policy is active in all periods.

To simplify the analysis, let us assume that the government does not respond at all to the
real debt; that is, A = 0. In this case, one can use the fact that b = 1 to simplify the
equilibrium equations (23)-(24). It then follows that in‡ation in period t = 1 is equal to d1
and is therefore totally una¤ected by the monetary authority’s actions. The important lesson is
that independent of how strongly the central bank responds to the in‡ationary consequences of
the discount factor shock during the con‡ict period (t = 1), in‡ation raises by the …xed amount
d
t.
Furthermore, it should be noted that real debt also rises after the shock because A > 1 .11
As in case 1, this increase is due to the active monetary policy: to control in‡ation the monetary
authority raises the interest rate, which in turn determines an increase in the service cost of
debt. Even more importantly, a more aggressive monetary policy during the con‡ict period
causes a higher …scal imbalance, which in turn brings about a higher in‡ation rate in the
following period. The more hawkish monetary policy is during the con‡ict period (i.e., the
higher A ), the larger the stock of real debt at the end of period 1 because monetary tightening
raises the interest paid on government debt.
If the central bank keeps responding to in‡ation in the post-con‡ict period ( P > 0), then
the hawkish policy strategy taken during the con‡ict period leads to a persistently higher
path of in‡ation afterward. To see this, recall that from period t = 2 onward, the dynamics
of in‡ation and real debt are determined by equation (20). As explained earlier, the central
bank’s (timid) response to in‡ation ( P > 0) during the post-con‡ict period induces persistent

in‡ation dynamics.
Figure 2 illustrates these three results by showing the propagation of an in‡ationary shock
for a set of central bank’s responses to in‡ation in period 1, A 2 f1:5; 2:0; 2:5g, and for a set
of passive responses in subsequent periods, P 2 f0; 0:5g (left and right plots, respectively).
We set the discount factor = 0:9901. Furthermore, we assume that the steady-state debtto-output ratio b is equal to 0:6 and the …scal authority’s active response ( A ) is equal to 0.
The key lesson that we learn from this simple model goes as follows: If agents expect that the
central bank has lost …scal backing permanently, hawkish monetary policy back…res. Hawkish
monetary policy not only fails to lower in‡ation during the con‡ict period, but also ends up
delivering higher in‡ation in the post-con‡ict periods because it generates an increase in the
stock of debt that needs to be stabilized by in‡ation. As we shall see subsequently, this key
lesson also applies to richer models.

A New-Keynesian Model

In this section we build a more elaborate model by extending the basic new-Keynesian model
employed by Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000), Woodford (2003), Galí (2008), and Lubik and
Schorfheide (2004) to include a …scal rule, the possibility of occasionally large recession episodes
that are associated with sizable debt accumulation, and uncertainty about the post-recession
monetary and …scal policy mix. The economy consists of a continuum of monopolistic …rms, a
representative household, and a monetary authority (or central bank). Some of the elements
of the model are similar to the ones used in Bianchi and Melosi (2017). This will allow us
to calibrate the model by borrowing some of the parameters estimated in that paper that
featured changes in the monetary and …scal policy mix and the possibility of large preference
shocks. However, the key distinctive feature of the current model the possibility of con‡icts
between policymakers was not contemplated in that paper. The results that follow are robust
to using simpler or richer versions of the New-Keynesian model. The key ingredients are the
presence of nominal rigidities, to create a link between in‡ation and real activity, and changes
in policymakers’behavior, to create the possibility of a con‡ict between the monetary and …scal
authorities.

dt = d dt 1 + d d;t . The discrete component d dt can assume two values: high or low (dh or dl ).
The variable dt controls the regime in place and evolves according to the transition matrix H d :

where pji = P dt+1 = jj dt = i . Henceforth, when the the variable dt = h and, hence, d dt = dh ,
we say that the economy is in the high state of demand. Conversely, when the the variable dt = l
and, hence, d dt = dl , we say that the economy is in the low state of demand.
This speci…cation is in the spirit of Christiano et al. (2011). However, in the current setup
shocks to preferences are assumed to be recurrent, and agents take into account that these
episodes can lead to unusual responses from policymakers, as discussed later on. The household
budget constraint is given by:
Pt Ct + Ptm Btm + Pts Bts = Pt Wt ht + Bts

Tt + T Rt ;

where Dt stands for real dividends paid by the …rms, Pt is government of consumption good,
ht is hours, Wt is the real wage, Tt is taxes, and T Rt stands for transfers. Following Woodford
(2001), we assume that there are two types of government bonds: one-period government debt,
Bts , in zero net supply with price Pts ; and a more general portfolio of government debt, Btm , in
non-zero net supply with price Ptm . The former debt instrument satis…es Pts = Rt 1 . The latter
debt instrument has the payment structure T (t+1) for T > t and 0 < < 1. The asset can be
interpreted as a portfolio of in…nitely many bonds with an average maturity controlled by the
parameter . The value of such an instrument issued in period t in any future period t + j is

where t = Pt =Pt 1 is gross in‡ation at time t and is the corresponding deterministic steady

3.2

Policy Regimes

The Markov-switching process pt determines the policy mix conditional on the state of demand
d
t . This exogenous variable captures in reduced form the complex interplay between the monetary and …scal authorities. The fact that the state of demand is discrete makes it easier to
condition the type of monetary and …scal policies adopted, which is captured by pt , on the state
of demand, which is captured by dt . Agents are rational, and they understand that recessions
and expansions a¤ects the way in which the monetary and …scal authorities coordinate their
policies.
When the state of the demand is high ( dt = dh ), three possible policy mixes can arise
depending on pt . Policymakers can conduct a monetary-led policy mix ( pt = M ), with monetary
policy geared toward in‡ation stabilization ( = ;M > 1) and …scal policy aimed at adjusting
primary surpluses to stabilize the debt-to-output ratio ( b = b;M > 1 1). When demand
is high, policymakers can also follow a …scally-led policy mix ( pt = F ), with the monetary
authority that de-emphasizes in‡ation stabilization (
= ;F
1) and the …scal authority
1
that disregards the level of debt ( b = b;F
1). Finally, a non-coordinated (or con‡ict)
policy mix ( pt = C) can arise, with the monetary authority that is resolute in his commitment
to stabilize in‡ation ( = ;C > 1) and the …scal authority that disregards debt stabilization
1
( b = b;C
1). As shown in the Fisherian model, the third policy mix leads to no stable
21

rational expectations equilibria when considered in isolation.13 In this case, the government
would like in‡ation to adjust to stabilize debt, whereas the central bank does not want to
let in‡ation go up. Thus, this regime captures the possibility that the monetary and …scal
authorities go through a con‡ict over the determination of the rate of in‡ation. We refer to
this type of policy mix as non-coordinated in the sense that policymakers are not in agreement
about what is the rate of in‡ation that they see as appropriate.
When the state of demand is low ( dt = dl ), we assume that the monetary authority deemphasizes in‡ation stabilization and the government carries out a …scal stimulus by momentarily disregarding the level of debt. Therefore, when the state of demand is low, the policy
1
mix is …scally led ( = ;F 1 and b = b;F
1). It is worth clarifying that the fact
that policymakers respond with the …scally-led policy mix to large recessions is not essential
for the main results of this paper. However, we believe that this assumption is quite plausible,
since policymakers arguably put less emphasis on in‡ation and debt stabilization during severe
economic downturns.
More formally, the joint dynamics of demand and policy regimes are captured by the following transition matrix Q:
Q=

"

phh QH
(1 phh ) QI

(1

pll ) QO
pll QL

#

:

The columns of this matrix sum to one. The matrix QH controls the dynamics of the policy
regime pt conditional on being in a high state of demand. As we discussed earlier, when the state
of demand is high, the policy regime can be monetary led, …scally led, or non-coordinated. QL
is the transition matrix that governs the evolution of policy regimes during the large recession
triggered by the discrete demand shock dt (the low state of demand). As we noticed before,
these regimes are all characterized by the …scally-led policy mix. However, the regimes di¤er in
terms of the policy mix that is likely to prevail once the negative preference shock is reabsorbed.
These possible outcomes are captured by the transition matrix QO . The matrix QI controls
the policy regime dynamics when the low state of demand materializes ( dt = dl ).
This modelling framework captures rational agents’uncertainty about the response of policymakers to the potentially large accumulation of debt that occurs in response to a large
contractionary shock. As we shall see, agents’ beliefs about what will happen after a large
recession are critical for the macroeconomic dynamics during the recession. These beliefs are
captured by the matrix QO . The remaining shocks are assumed to be small, and hence, reces13
Leeper’s results for the Fisherian model would apply to this New Keynesian model if the policy regimes were
not allowed to change. With Markov-switching, the analysis of global stability of the system is more complicated.
We will focus on parameterizations that ensure mean square stability of the model (Costa, Fragoso, and Marques
2004).

sions caused by these shocks are assumed not to give rise to relevant …scal strain.
Linearization. We linearize the …scal variables around the steady state and log-linearize all
the non-…scal variables. Details on how we solve the linearized model is provided in Appendix
B.

3.3

Policy Con‡icts and Solution

In this paper, we contemplate scenarios in which agents expect that the …scal authority can
disregard the level of debt (active …scal policy) while the central bank remains committed
to stabilizing in‡ation (active monetary policy). We call this mix of active monetary and
…scal policies non-coordinated because it is inconsistent with determining the unique path for
in‡ation. In fact, if this policy mix were followed forever, Leeper (1991) shows that there is no
stable rational expectations equilibria. To see why, suppose that in‡ation is above target and
that the Federal Reserve tries to push it down by increasing the federal funds rate more than
one-to-one in response to the observed deviation. This action prompts an increase in the real
interest rate, a contraction in output, and, consequently, an acceleration in the rise of the debtto-output ratio. This acceleration in the dynamic of the debt-to-output ratio would require
an increase in taxation, but agents know that this is not going to happen because the …scal
authority is active. Therefore, the adjustment has to come through an increase in in‡ation that
triggers an even larger increase in the interest rate and so on. Clearly, the economy is on an
explosive path, and if this situation were to persist, no stationary solution would exist. This
explains while this scenario has been largely neglected in the study of monetary/…scal policy
interactions.
However, if the con‡ict (active monetary policy/active …scal policy) regime is expected to
eventually end, the model can still admit a stable and unique rational expectations equilibrium.
The model could present temporary explosive dynamics, but as long as these are not expected
to last for too long, a stationary solution would still exist. This is the key insight that allows
us to solve the model allowing for periods of con‡ict by leveraging the recent advancements in
the literature on solution methods for Markov-switching general equilibrium models. We use
the solution algorithm proposed by Farmer, Waggoner, and Zha (2009). This solution method
requires the solution to satisfy mean square stability: First and second moments need to be
stationary when taking into account the possibility of regime changes. However, quite importantly, the solution method does not impose that all regimes taken in isolation are stationary,
allowing for temporary explosive dynamics. Given that agents form expectations by taking into
account the possibility of regime changes, their expectations are still …nite at every horizon,
even when the economy is temporarily on an explosive path because of the con‡ict between
the two authorities. As we shall see, the properties of the solution are determined by which

The E¤ects of Lack of Policy Coordination

Table 1 shows the parameter values used in this paper. We denote the probability of staying
in the monetary-led, …scally-led, and con‡ict policy mix as pM M ; pF F , and pCC , respectively.
Most of the parameter values and transition probabilities are based on a previous estimation
by Bianchi and Melosi (2017). Nonetheless, the model estimated by Bianchi and Melosi (2017)
does not feature non-coordinated regimes. We calibrate the probability pCC = 0:90, implying
that agents expect the con‡ict regime to last 10 quarters. Moderate changes to this parameter
values in this parameter would not a¤ect the key mechanisms that will be discussed later.
We assume that during the con‡ict the central bank responds even more strongly to in‡ation
than in the monetary-led case ( ;C = 2:0 > ;M ). Furthermore, the central bank is totally
focused on controlling in‡ation and completely disregards the level of real activity y;C = 0.
This parameter choice serves the important purpose of clearly showing the leading mechanisms
at play when policymakers do not coordinate their policies or when they are expected not to
coordinate their policies after a large recession. To induce large debt accumulation during the
low state of demand, we assume that transfers adjust more strongly to business cycle conditions
( y ) than during regular business cycle ‡uctuations. These parameter choices allow us to see
the e¤ects of a lack of monetary and …scal policy coordination more clearly in the graphs that
24

follow but these choices do not a¤ect the main results of the paper.
The magnitude of the negative demand shock (dl ) is three times smaller than the shock
that caused the Great Recession based on the estimates of Bianchi and Melosi (2017). We set
the value of the negative demand shock to be smaller in order to avoid the issue of the zero
lower bound constraint for the nominal interest rate. Increasing the magnitude of the negative
discrete demand shock would strengthen the results of the paper but at the costs of making
the exposition of the key mechanisms unnecessarily more complicated. The parameter b =4
denotes the steady-state debt-to-output ratio on an annualized basis whose value is estimated
by Bianchi and Melosi (2017). The other parameters do not play a key role in determining the
results that follow. The table with all the parameter values is shown in Appendix C.
Following Bianchi and Melosi (2017), the probability that a large recession hits in every
high-demand period is very tiny, since the probability phh is very close to one. While this
parameterization is certainly extreme, it simpli…es the analysis substantially by implying that
once the economy exits the recession, the high-demand regime is de-facto an absorbing state.
This choice has the advantage of clearly isolating the key mechanisms at play when we introduce
the possibility of non-coordination between the monetary and …scal authorities. The value for
the parameter captures the average duration of U.S. debt which is roughly …ve years. The
parameter controlling the elasticity of substitution between di¤erentiated goods, , and the
parameter controlling the degree of nominal rigidities ' are not separably identi…able once the
model is log-linearized and, hence, as in Bianchi and Melosi (2017), we directly calibrate the
slope of the New Keynesian Phillips curve, , that links in‡ation ~ t to real activity y^t . The
value of is pinned down by
=R, whose values are provided in Table 1.
In this section, we use the calibrated model to run some experiments to study situations
in which agents lose their trust in the government’s commitment to make the necessary …scal
adjustments to stabilize debt. Apart from the initial debt-to-output ratio, which is calibrated
to match the U.S. debt at the end of 2016 according to the CBO (77%), we assume that all the
other variables are at the steady state when the economy is hit by a negative discrete demand
shock that triggers a large recession. Policymakers adopt a …scally-led policy mix in an attempt
to carry out a …scal stimulus. The debt-to-output ratio increases and agents expect one of the
following post-recession outcomes: (i) the government is committed to make the necessary
…scal adjustments to stabilize the growing debt-to-output ratio (monetary-led policy mix); (ii)
the government is not committed to stabilize the post-recession debt and the central bank is
expected to accommodate the government by de-emphasizing in‡ation stabilization (…scally-led
policy mix); (iii) the government is not committed to stabilize the post-recession debt and the
central bank is expected to …ght back against the …scal authority in an attempt to stabilize
in‡ation (non-coordination). This institutional con‡ict lasts only temporarily, and agents form
expectations about which authority will eventually emerge victorious from the con‡ict. If agents
25

expect that the …scally-led (monetary-led) policy mix will be adopted following the con‡ict, we
say that the …scal (monetary) authority is expected to prevail in the con‡ict over the control
of the rate of in‡ation. To simplify the exposition of the results, we assume that agents’beliefs
turn out to be correct.
These four possible post-recession scenarios ( pt = M , pt = F , pt = C with the …scal
authority expected to win, and pt = C with the monetary authority expected to win) and the
out-of-the-recession outcomes are modeled by introducing eight regimes. The …rst two regimes
capture the coordinated policy mixes under the high state of demand. The third and fourth
regimes are non-coordinated regimes that di¤er in their probability of moving to the monetaryled policy mix as the con‡ict ends. The third regime is assumed to lead to the monetary-led
policy mix with probability one, whereas the fourth regime is assumed to lead to the …scallyled policy mix with probability one. The four …scally-led regimes during the low state of
demand di¤er on the probability of moving to the four high-demand policy combinations. This
parameterization implies that during the low state of demand, agents know with certainty which
policy mix will be realized once the economy moves back to the high state of demand. While
this is certainly a strong assumption, it allows us to isolate the key mechanisms at work. We
show how this assumption a¤ects our results in the appendix. All in all, the evolution of these
eight regimes is captured by the following transition matrix for regimes ( dt , pt ):

Macroeconomic Dynamics with Lack of Coordination

Figure 3 shows the macroeconomic dynamics of the output gap, in‡ation, the federal funds rate,
and debt-to-GDP ratio under the following sequence of events. At time t = 0, the economy is at

26

the steady state and the (annualized) debt-to-GDP ratio is 77:0%. At time t = 1 the economy is
hit by the negative demand shock until time t = 10 ( dt = dl for 1 t 10). This low-demand
period is highlighted by the dark gray area. From period t = 11 through period t = 30, the
economy switches back to the high state of demand. We consider two cases. In the …rst case,
during the low state of demand, agents expect that policymakers will conduct a …scally-led
policy mix (coordination) once the state of demand switches back to high in period 11. This
case is captured by the dashed line. In the second case, during the low state of demand, agents
expect that policymakers will compete for the control over the rate of in‡ation once the state
of demand switches back to high in period 11. Furthermore, we assume that agents expect that
the …scal authority will eventually prevail. In other words, when the con‡ict ends, the central
bank is expected to change policy and the policy mix becomes …scally led. This second case is
captured by the solid line.
We assume that if it occurs, the con‡ict regime lasts for ten quarters and then the …scallyled policy mix will stay in place from period 21 through period 30. The period of con‡ict
between the two authorities is highlighted by the light gray area in Figure 3. Agents do not
know ex-ante the exact duration of the recession (the dark gray area), how many periods the
post-recession institutional con‡ict will last (the light gray area), and how long the high state
of demand will persist (the light gray area and the white area). However, agents observe the
history of regimes and know their likely durations.
Con‡ict and Fiscally-led Resolution. When agents expect an institutional con‡ict
followed by the …scally-led policy mix, agents anticipate that the large and growing stock of
debt will be in‡ated away. Hence, in‡ation expectations and in‡ation rise. During the con‡ict
period (11 t 20) the central bank applies the Taylor principle to rein in these in‡ationary
pressures. The monetary tightening conducted during the con‡ict period determines an increase
in real interest rates. As a result, the service cost of debt increases and the economy enters a
recession. Both e¤ects of the monetary policy intervention lead to further debt accumulation,
exacerbating the …scal imbalance. This, in turn, strengthens the in‡ationary pressures because
agents expect the …scal authority to eventually prevail and hence disregard debt stabilization
for a long time. But higher in‡ationary pressures call for further monetary tightening, which
leads to an even larger recession and greater …scal imbalance. Therefore, when agents expect a
con‡ict between policymakers, the economy goes through a vicious spiral of higher debt, higher
in‡ation, higher interest rate, and lower real activity.
Monetary policy interventions, consequently, lead to a double-dip recession. The second
recession is entirely due to policymakers’behaviors because the state of demand is high from
period 11 on. Furthermore, during the …rst recession, forward-looking and rational agents anticipate the macroeconomic dynamics that will occur during the con‡ict. Therefore, expecting
an institutional con‡ict causes the economic crisis to be more severe and gives rise to upward

Figure 3: Dynamics of the output gap, in‡ation, the federal funds rate (FFR), and the debt-to-GDP ratio
when a negative discrete demand shock occurs in period 1 and persists until period 10 (the dark gray area).
The discrete demand shock switches back to high from period 11 through period 30. The dashed line captures
the macroeconomic dynamics when agents expect that policymakers will coordinate to follow the …scally-led
policy mix once the discrete demand shock switches back to high. The solid line captures the situation when
agents expect a con‡ict between the two authorities to break out right after the end of the low-demand period.
The con‡ict is assumed to occur from period 11 through period 20 (the light gray area) and agents expect that
the …scal authority will win; that is, the policymakers will engage in …scally-led policies from period 21 on. The
dashed-dotted line captures the steady-state values.

pressures on in‡ation during the recession period (the dark gray area). Interestingly, the dynamics of the four variables depicted in Figure 3 are temporarily explosive during the con‡ict
period (the light gray area). As explained earlier in the paper, if these dynamics were to persist
forever, they would not be consistent with a stationary solution for the model. However, the
model is solved taking into account that this pattern is only temporary and that eventually the
con‡ict will come to an end.
What is concerning is that during the institutional con‡ict (the light gray area), the central
bank is incapable of reining in in‡ation. The monetary authority follows the Taylor principle
and raises the interest rate aggressively to lower in‡ation. Nonetheless, in‡ation keeps growing.
The lesson we learn is that when the central bank lacks the necessary …scal backing, hawkish
monetary policy is not only ine¤ective, but also counterproductive, as it leads to a spiral of
low output and high in‡ation. The explosive dynamics of the interest rate and in‡ation during
the institutional con‡ict can make the Federal Reserve an easy target for the media that could
bring into question the central bank’s ability to control in‡ation and the soundness of the
implemented policies.
If instead agents expect that policymakers will immediately coordinate on the …scally-led
policy mix once the state of demand switches back to high, the large stock of debt leads to
heightened and persistent in‡ation. Since heightened in‡ation expectations reduce the real
28

value of debt, debt-to-GDP ratio grows only moderately during the recession. Furthermore,
the dovish monetary policy keeps the real interest rate low, which contributes to mitigating the
severity of the recession during the low-demand period (the dark gray area) and leads to an
economic boom when the discrete demand shock becomes positive again (t 11).
The outcomes of both the coordinated and the uncoordinated strategies are clearly far
from being desirable. While the coordinated strategy clearly dominates the non-coordinated
both in terms of output stabilization and in terms of achieving a lower in‡ation rate, in both
cases policymakers miss their objective of keeping in‡ation low. During the low-demand period
(the dark gray area) and the post-con‡ict period (from period 21 on) policymakers follow
the same policy mix (i.e., the …scally-led policy mix). Therefore, in Figure 3 the vertical
di¤erence between the solid line and the dashed line during the low-demand period (the dark
gray area) captures the e¤ects of expecting a con‡ict followed by the …scally-led policy mix on
the macroeconomy. These e¤ects are fairly large. The recession is more severe and prolonged
and the larger stock of debt pushes in‡ation on a higher path. The vertical di¤erence between
the solid and the dashed line from period 11 on (the light gray area) captures the macroeconomic
implications of going through a con‡ict. These implications are also very severe especially for
real activity.
Con‡ict and Monetary-led resolution. Figure 4 compares the scenario that we just
discussed (solid line) with the opposite polar case in which the monetary authority is expected to
eventually prevail (dotted line). This alternative scenario serves as a useful reference point that
we will then use to discuss the consequences of relaxing the hypothesis that agents know with
certainty which authority will eventually prevail. When the monetary authority is expected to
prevail, the …scal stimulus is ine¤ective in raising in‡ation expectations and, hence, to lower
the real interest rate during the low-demand period. As a result, the economy goes through
an output contraction and a sizable drop in in‡ation. In‡ation moves close to the target once
the demand shock switches back to the high state. Nonetheless, the central bank tries to …ght
the persistent in‡ation that arises after the recession and, in doing so, impairs the economic
activity, with the output gap remaining in negative territory for the duration of the institutional
con‡ict. Once the government gives up and switches to passive …scal policy, economic activity
improves but still remains in negative territory because of the contractionary monetary policy.
Why does output remain slightly below target after the con‡ict is resolved and policymakers
follow the monetary-led policy mix? This happens because the central bank conducts an active
policy and tries to rein in in‡ation that remains persistently above target. In turn, in‡ation
is slightly above target because of the large stock of debt accumulated during the recession
and the institutional con‡ict. Since agents are aware of regime changes, they understand that
the government can always renege on its commitment to stabilize the large stock of debt by
raising taxes and move to the …scally-led policy mix. However, the probability of this event is

Figure 4: Dynamics of the output gap, in‡ation, the federal funds rate (FFR), and the debt-to-GDP ratio
when a negative discrete demand shock occurs in period 1 and persists until period 10 (the dark gray area).
The discrete demand shock switches back to high from period 11 through period 30. Agents expect a con‡ict
between the two authorities following the end of the low demand shock period. The con‡ict is assumed to occur
from period 11 through period 20 (the light gray area). The solid line captures the case in which agents expect
that the …scal authority will win the con‡ict and, hence, the policy mix is expected to be …scally led after the
con‡ict. The dotted line captures the case in which the monetary authority is expected to prevail and, hence,
the policy mix is expected to be monetary led after the con‡ict period. The dashed-dotted line captures the
steady-state values.

quite small: 1 pM M = 0:68%.14 When the stock of debt is low, a low probability that the
government will give up on stabilizing debt does not raise in‡ation expectations signi…cantly.
Nonetheless, when the stock of debt is so high as the one accumulated during the large recession
(the dark gray area) and the subsequent institutional con‡ict (the light gray area) in Figure
4, in‡ation remains above its steady-state value even though the probability that policymakers
will engage in the …scally led policy mix in the future is small. This is for two reasons. First,
such a large stock of debt can be stabilized only over a long period of time and the probability
that policymakers will switch to the …scally led policies during this long period of time is
not negligible. Second, if the switch to …scally-led policies happens when debt is high, the
in‡ationary consequences will be very severe. Furthermore, it should be noted that the little
bump in in‡ation after the con‡ict and the associated amelioration of the output gap are
due to the less aggressive anti-in‡ationary policy conducted by the central bank under the
monetary-led policy mix compared with the monetary policy carried out during the con‡ict
period ( ;M < ;C ; see Table 1).
It is also interesting to notice that the output gap falls by a similar amount during the

Furthermore, agents take into account that should a large recession happen again, the policy mix will turn
to …scally led. However, the probability that the demand shock switches to the low state in every period is

low-demand period regardless of the private sector’s expectations about future monetary and
…scal policies. In this respect, it is worth noting that from expecting di¤erent post-con‡ict
resolutions, there are two main e¤ects on the output gap during the low-demand period. If
agents expect a con‡ict followed by the …scally-led policy mix, they also expect a double-dip
recession when the demand switches to the high state from period 11 until the end of the
institutional con‡ict. These expectations worsen the recession during the low-demand period
because agents are forward looking. Note that if agents expect a con‡ict followed by the …scallyled regime, the more persistent (in expectations) the …ght regime, the deeper the high-demand
period’s recession, and the worse the low-demand period’s recession. There is, however, a second
e¤ect. When agents expect that the monetary authority will prevail, policymakers fail to raise
in‡ation and, in fact, in‡ation is close to zero during the low-demand period. On the contrary,
when the …scal authority is expected to prevail, in‡ation does not drop and remains close to
target. Therefore, in the former case the real interest rate is higher and, hence, consumption
and output are lower, everything else being equal.
Our calibration is for the US economy and is based on previous studies. Given this calibration, it turns out that these two e¤ects tend to cancel each other out. Thus, the output
gap during the low-demand period is remarkably similar regardless of the expected resolution
of the con‡ict. This result is not general and implies by no means that the expected resolution
of the con‡ict is inconsequential for the output dynamics during the low-demand period. In
Appendix D, we illustrate this point via a counterexample.
Con‡ict and Uncertain Resolution. So far, we have considered the polar opposite cases
in which agents expect either the monetary-led resolution to the con‡ict with a probability of
one or the …scally-led resolution with a probability of one. We have chosen these polar cases in
order to simplify the explanation of the mechanisms at play. Nevertheless, in practice, agents
are likely to be fairly uncertain about the outcome of an institutional con‡ict like the one
studied in this paper. In Figure 4, the vertical di¤erence between the solid line and the dotted
line during the low-demand period (the dark gray area) and the con‡ict period (the light gray
area) spans the set of possible outcomes.15 The exact outcomes depend on the private sector’s
beliefs about which authority will eventually emerge victorious from the con‡ict. The set of
possible outcomes is fairly large, including de‡ation and high in‡ation, severe recessions with
the output gap plummeting to -4%, and moderate economic contractions with the output gap
falling by less than one percentage point. The larger this set of beliefs-driven outcomes, the
larger the degree of vulnerability of the economy to changes in the private sector’s beliefs when
15

As shown in Appendix E, when agents are uncertain about how the institutional con‡ict will be resolved,
the macroeconomic dynamics during the low-demand period (gray area) and the con‡ict period (light gray area)
are a linear combination of those cases in which agents are not uncertain about which authority will prevail
(i.e., the two polar cases discussed earlier). The higher the probability that the …scal (monetary) authority will
win, the closer the macroeconomic dynamics will be to the solid (dotted) line.

31

an institutional con‡ict is expected to arise after the recession. If beliefs about which authority
will prevail after the con‡ict are erratic, macroeconomic volatility during the recession and the
following con‡ict period may be quite large. We discuss the case in which agents are uncertain
about the outcome of the con‡ict in Appendix E.
Key insight. To summarize, if the government’s commitment to make the necessary …scal
adjustments to stabilize a large stock of debt is questioned by the private sector, the central
bank has two options. The central bank can accommodate these beliefs by abandoning its antiin‡ationary stance, or it can …ght back and rea¢ rm its commitment to keep in‡ation stable.
In the former case, in‡ation increases substantially and remains persistently high during and
after the recession. In the latter case, an institutional con‡ict is expected to happen after the
recession and economic outcomes are largely driven by the private sector’s expectations about
which authority will change its policy to end the con‡ict. We …nd that institutional con‡icts
lead inevitably to bad outcomes and are accompanied by large macroeconomic volatility. If the
central bank is expected to lose the con‡ict by switching to passive policies, a vicious spiral of
low output, high in‡ation, and high debt will arise during the con‡ict period, which exacerbates
the economic crisis and raises in‡ation during the recession. Quite interestingly, in this scenario
the central bank raises the policy rate but fails to rein in in‡ation, which actually accelerates
during the con‡ict period. However, if the central bank is expected to win the con‡ict, the
…scal stimulus is ine¤ective in rescuing the economy from the large recession. The economy
experiences a discrete and persistent drop in in‡ation during the low-demand period, and a
large stock of debt, as well as a persistently higher-than-target in‡ation after the recession.

5

Debt Targeting

In this section, we study a coordinated strategy that can be implemented when the private
sector loses con…dence in the government’s ability/willingness to stabilize debt through …scal
adjustments. This strategy commits the central bank to accept just enough higher in‡ation
to stabilize the debt-to-output ratio resulting from a large recession triggered by a negative
demand shock. The government remains committed to making the necessary …scal adjustments
to guarantee long-run …scal backing.
As shown here, this coordinated strategy can be implemented by explicitly announcing a
target for the debt-to-GDP ratio that the …scal authority pledges to repay through future …scal
adjustments. No …scal plans are instead provided to stabilize the o¤-target amount of the debtto-GDP ratio, which policymakers have agreed to in‡ate away. The target is de…ned as the
debt-to-output ratio that would have prevailed absent large demand shocks, dt . The central
bank allows in‡ation to rise just enough to in‡ate away the o¤-target debt. We call this strategy

32

the coordinated strategy or debt-targeting rule.

5.1

General Case

To model this coordinated strategy geared to in‡ate away the amount of debt resulting from
large recessions, we assume that policymakers respond to in‡ation and the debt-to-output ratio
according to the monetary-led policy mix all the time, except when responding to the discrete
demand shock dt . Speci…cally, we assume that the response of the nominal interest rate to
in‡ation and that of primary surpluses to debt are both zero if movements in these variables
result from the large demand shock. Furthermore, policymakers respond to all other ‡uctuations
in in‡ation and the debt-to-output ratio that are driven by Gaussian shocks by following the
monetary-led policy mix. As explained earlier, Gaussian shocks are assumed to be too small to
raise …scal strains that can fuel expectations that the government may be incapable of making
the necessary …scal adjustments to stabilize debt. To simplify the analysis, we also assume that
policymakers respond to the output gap by following the monetary-led policy mix regardless of
the nature of the shocks that have hit the economy.16
In order to implement this policy we construct a shadow economy to keep track of the
amount of debt and in‡ation resulting from the discrete preference shock. We denote the debt
and in‡ation of the shadow economy in which discrete demand shocks are shut down as ^bnd
t
nd
and ~ t , respectively. We then write the linearized policy rules as follows:

where we assume b;F = b;F = 0: The shadow economy is initialized by setting the initial stock
of debt equal to the one in the actual economy. These policy rules imply that the government
is not responsible for stabilizing the o¤-target debt-to-output ratio ^bt 1 ^bnd
t 1 , which is due
to the discrete demand shock, and the central bank allows in‡ation to rise by ~ t ~ nd
; just
t
enough to stabilize the o¤-target debt-to-output ratio. More details on how to write the model
equations when policymakers follow the rules (29)-(30) are in Appendix F.
The solid line in Figure 5 captures the macroeconomic implications of adopting the coordinated strategy. The starred line shows the time-varying targets for in‡ation and the debt-toGDP ratio. These targets are the dynamics of in‡ation and debt-to-GDP ratio in the shadow
economy. Contrary to the non-coordinated case, this coordinated strategy successfully raises
16

The last assumption is motivated by the fact that we have de…ned monetary and …scal policy coordination
in terms of policymakers’behaviors towards in‡ation and debt stabilization. However, this assumption can be
relaxed by letting policymakers respond di¤erently to the output gap depending on the nature of the shocks
that have hit the economy.

in‡ation expectations during the recession by promising that the debt resulting from the economic downturn will be in‡ated away. Consequently, this promise puts downward pressures on
the real interest rate, and hence, the drop in the output gap is mitigated compared with the
cases where an institutional con‡ict is expected to break out after the recession. Given that

in‡ation necessary to stabilize it. As the debt-to-GDP ratio slowly converges to its target, the
price dynamics slow down and in‡ation gets closer to its two-percent target.
The coordinated policy rules (29)-(30) imply that policymakers follow the …scally-led policy
mix only in response to the debt-to-output ratio and in‡ation resulting from the low state of
demand. The policy rules imply that the central bank always follows an active monetary policy
in response to output gap ‡uctuations. This is the reason why the interest rate falls during the
recession in Figure 5. This feature of the coordinated policy rules can be relaxed with little
e¤ects on the results of the paper.
Finally, as shown in Appendix G, the dynamics of the output gap, in‡ation, and nominal
interest rate are totally una¤ected by the pre-crisis size of the debt-to-GDP ratio, which will
be stabilized by taking the necessary …scal measures. This makes it clear that the proposed
policy separates the issue of long-run …scal sustainability from the need to intervene during
exceptional events. This is a feature of the coordinated strategy that we will investigate further
in the following section.

5.2

Avoiding Liquidity Traps

The zero ‡oor for nominal interest rates can be a signi…cant constraint on the ability of a central
bank to combat de‡ation. Krugman (1998) and Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) propose the
use of forward guidance, which are announcements about the likely future path of the policy
rate, to ease this constraint on monetary policy. These scholars suggest promising a period of
monetary accommodation once the recession is over. In doing so, the central bank is promising
a boom and higher in‡ation after the recession, leading to a fall in the real rate that mitigates
the recession as well as the drop in in‡ation.
Our coordinated strategy can be regarded as an alternative way of promising higher in‡ation
after a period of very low demand. The distinctive feature of our approach is the coordination
between monetary and …scal policies so as to rule out zero lower bound episodes by generating
in‡ationary pressures from …scal imbalances. As for forward guidance, higher in‡ation lowers
the real interest rate and, in doing so, stimulates economic activity, reducing the size of the
output contraction and stabilizing the price dynamics during periods of extremely low demand.
As we shall show, this mechanism can be strong enough to prevent the economy from hitting
the zero lower bound. At the same time, agents understand that the increase in in‡ation
is the result of a well-de…ned, exceptional contractionary event, which policymakers are not
responsible for, while policy strategies to cope with business cycle (Gaussian) disturbances are
unchanged.
Figure 6 shows the dynamics of the output gap, in‡ation, federal funds rate, and debt-toGDP ratio following a very large negative demand shock, which is calibrated to be as big as
the one that caused the Great Recession based on estimates by Bianchi and Melosi (2017). We
calibrate the initial debt to be 35% of GDP, which was the debt-to-GDP ratio in the U.S. before
the Great Recession according to CBO’s estimates.17 The dashed line captures the macroeconomic dynamics when policymakers follow a monetary-led policy mix during the low-demand
period (the gray area) and agents expect that this policy mix will be followed in every future
period. We observe that this strong commitment to monetary dominance would lead monetary
policy to become constrained by the zero lower bound during the recession.18 The solid line
captures the macroeconomic dynamics when policymakers are not committed to stabilizing the
debt-to-GDP ratio resulting from the large recession. This coordinated commitment allows the
central bank to avoid the zero lower bound by raising in‡ation expectations.
Our coordinated monetary and …scal policy strategy is in line with the policies advocated by
17

Changing the size of the initial debt-to-GDP ratio is inconsequential for the results that follow. See Appendix
G, where we show that changing the initial stock of debt is inconsequential if policymakers coordinate to in‡ate
away only the portion of debt resulting from the large recession. Furthermore, if the monetary-led policy mix
is followed in every state of the world, the macroeconomy is fully insulated from …scal developments.
18
Monetary policy does not become constrained exactly when the recession starts but only a few quarters
after because the central bank adjusts the interest rate smoothly ( R;M = 0:8697).

Figure 6: Dynamics of the output gap, in‡ation, federal funds rate (FFR), and debt-to-GDP ratio after a
negative discrete demand shock that occurs in period 1 and persists until period 10 (the gray area). The
magnitude of this shock is comparable to the demand shock that caused the Great Recession (Bianchi and
Melosi 2017). After the recession the state of demand switches to the high regime from period 11 through
period 30. The solid line captures the dynamics when the debt targeting rule is implemented. The dashed line
captures the macroeconomic dynamics when policymakers follow the monetary-led policy mix in every state of
the world. The dashed-dotted line captures the steady-state values.

Sims (2016) who suggests replacing ine¤ective monetary policies at the zero lower bound with an
“e¤ective …scal policy.”According to Sims, e¤ective …scal policy at the zero lower bound requires
that both the monetary and …scal authorities clearly announce that …scal accommodation will
not be removed until in‡ation will attain a given in‡ation target. Sims also argues that a
commitment to generate in‡ation that involves the …scal authority might also be more credible
than one that relies solely on the behavior of the monetary authority, given the time that it
takes to revert …scal decisions. We consider this as an interesting direction for future research.
Our shock-speci…c rule is also related to Correia et al. (2013), who show how distortionary
taxes can be used to replicate the e¤ects of negative nominal interest rates, and Galí (2014),
who analyzes the e¤ects of a …scal stimulus …nanced through money creation. Both these
papers work under the assumption that a monetary-led policy mix is always in place. Our
mechanism is based on a systematic policy response to exceptionally large shocks and does not
require using distortionary taxation or printing money (even if, of course, we could introduce
money and derive its implied path.) Instead, our shock-speci…c rule works by making debt
…scally unsustainable by specifying the way policymakers react to exceptionally large shocks.
In this respect, our shock-speci…c rule is in the spirit of Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe
(2002) who, following Woodford (2003), work in a deterministic environment to show that a
de‡ationary steady state can be made …scally unsustainable.

Conclusions

This paper studies the implication of the lack of coordination between the monetary and …scal
authorities. By lack of coordination we mean a situation in which both authorities are trying
to control the rate of in‡ation. When agents expect that policymakers will not coordinate
their policies after a large recession, two outcomes can arise. One possible outcome is that
policymakers appear to be incapable of raising in‡ation expectations to rescue the economy
from the recession. The other possible outcome is also dire. The economy enters a spiral of
growing debt, declining output, and raising in‡ationary pressures as a result of the monetary
tightening that is not backed by future …scal consolidations. Which case will prevail depends
on which authority is expected to change its policy to coordinate with the other.
We then consider a coordinated policy strategy that is capable of mitigating the recession
by raising in‡ation expectations in an orderly manner. This strategy consists of a commitment
to in‡ating away only the portion of debt that exceeds an announced target. This target is
de…ned as the debt-to-output ratio that would have prevailed absent the large contractionary
shock. In practice, an approximate measure of such a debt-to-GDP ratio can be obtained by
projecting the pre-recession stock of debt into the future. The central bank allows in‡ation to
rise just enough to in‡ate away the o¤-target debt. This strategy succeeds in mitigating deep
recessions because it a¤ects agents’beliefs about policymakers’long-run behavior in response
to a speci…c large shock. In fact, policymakers are committing to never increasing taxes in
response to the amount of debt accumulated during large contractions and, at the same time,
to not combating the resulting increase in in‡ation. This policy triggers an increase in shortrun in‡ation expectations and an immediate increase in in‡ation as large demand shocks hit
the economy. The proposed strategy has the virtue of clearly separating short-run policy
interventions from the issue of long-run …scal sustainability. This coordinated strategy can also
be used to promise a rate of in‡ation after a severe recession so as to avoid hitting the zero
lower bound for the nominal interest rate.

Now the laws of motion for pt and t are disjoint equations (one stable and one unstable)

Log-linearization of the DSGE Model

The Markov-switching process for dt represents a non-Gaussian shock. In order to log-linearize
the model, we follow these steps (for more details see Schorfheide 2005; Liu, Waggoner, and
Zha 2011; Bianchi and Ilut 2017; and Bianchi, Ilut, and Schneider 2017):
1. Compute the ergodic mean d for the preference shock dt :
2. Verify that the zero lower bound is not binding at d:
3. De…ne the regimes in terms of policymakers’ behavior and the value for the preference
d p
shock: t
t; t .
4. Conditional on each regime, linearize/log-linearize all equations around the deterministic
steady state and de…ne deviations of the preference shock from its ergodic mean as det =
dt d and e
d dt = d dt d. Notice that det can assume only two values e
dh and e
dl and that
the non-linearity associated to a regime change is retained.
5. Use the methods developed by Farmer et al. (2009) to solve the model. The solution
algorithm returns a MS-VAR whose parameters depend on the probability of moving

where Q is a diagonal matrix that contains the standard deviations of the structural

Unlike other papers that have used the technique described here, our model allows for nonorthogonality between policymakers’behavior and a discrete shock. This allows us to solve a
model in which agents take into account that a large preference shock leads to an immediate
change in policy, including the zero lower bound, and the ensuing exit strategies. This proposed
method is general and can be applied to other cases in which a shock induces a change in the
structural parameters.

Expected Resolution and the Low-Demand Period’s
Output Gap

As shown in Figure 4, the output gap during the low-demand period is remarkably similar
regardless of the expected resolution of the con‡ict. This result is not general and does not
imply that the expected resolution of the con‡ict is always inconsequential for the output
dynamics during low-demand periods.
To illustrate this point, we tweak the value of two key parameters. One parameter is the
probability pCC , which controls the expected duration of the institutional con‡ict. We lower
this parameter from 0.90 (as noted in Table 1) to 0.75. This has the e¤ect of mitigating
the expected double-dip recession for the case in which agents expect a …scally-led resolution
of the con‡ict (i.e., the …scal authority is expected to emerge from the institutional con‡ict
victorious). Furthermore, we lower the central bank’s response to in‡ation under the …scallyled policy mix ( ;F ) from 0.6903 to 0.1. This alternative parameterization makes the central
bank less aggressive when it comes to adjusting the nominal rate to stabilize in‡ation in the
…scally-led regime.
Figure 7 shows the outcomes under these alternative values assigned to the probability pCC
and the policy parameter
;F . Contrary to Figure 4, di¤erent expectations about how the
con‡ict will be resolved lead to radically di¤erent implications for the dynamics of the output
gap during the low-demand period (the dark gray area). If agents expect the the …scal authority
will emerge victorious from the institutional con‡ict (solid line in both Figure 4 and Figure 7),
the in‡ation generated from the …scal imbalance leads to a lower real interest rate and, hence, to
stronger economic activity compared with the case in which the central bank is relatively more
hawkish when the …scally-led regime is in place ( ;F = 0:6903 as in Table 1). Since forwardlooking agents anticipate these e¤ects, the recession is greatly mitigated and in‡ation jumps
above target during the low-demand period. Furthermore, expecting a shorter lasting con‡ict
following the low-demand period further improves economic activity during the low-demand
period.

E

Con‡ict and Uncertain Resolution

Finally, we consider the case in which there is uncertainty over how the con‡ict will be resolved.
Figure 8 shows the two extreme cases (i.e., 100% expected …scally-led resolution and 100%
expected monetary led resolution) that we have analyzed in Appendix D, together with a
scenario in which agents attach 50% of probability that the …scal authority will win the con‡ict

when a negative discrete demand shock occurs in period 1 and persists until period 10 (the dark gray area).
The discrete demand shock switches back to high from period 11 through period 30. Agents expect a con‡ict
between the two authorities following the end of the low-demand shock period. The con‡ict is assumed to occur
from period 11 through period 20 (the light gray area). The solid line captures the case in which agents expect
that the …scal authority will win the con‡ict and, hence, the policy mix is expected to be …scally led after the
con‡ict. The dotted line captures the case in which the monetary authority is expected to prevail and, hence,
the policy mix is expected to be monetary led after the con‡ict period. Unlike in the main text (Figure 4),
the probability of staying in the con‡ict regime is 0.75 and the central bank’s response to in‡ation under the
…scally-led regime is 0.1. The dashed-dotted line captures the steady-state values.

and 50% of probability that the monetary authority will succeed.20 The starred line lies between
the solid line and the dotted line all the time in the dark gray area and in the light gray
area. This suggests that when agents are uncertain about how the institutional con‡ict will be
resolved, the macroeconomic dynamics during the low-demand period (the dark gray area) and
the con‡ict period (the light gray area) are a linear combination of those in the case in which
agents are not uncertain about which authority will prevail. The higher the probability that
the …scal (monetary) authority will win, the closer the macroeconomic dynamics will be to the
solid (dotted) line.
The vertical di¤erence between the solid line and the dotted line during the recession and the
con‡ict period spans the set of possible outcomes. The exact outcomes depend on the private
sector’s beliefs about which authority will eventually emerge victorious from the con‡ict. The
set of possible outcomes is fairly large, including de‡ation and high in‡ation, severe recessions
with the output gap plummeting to -4% and moderate economic contractions with the output
20

This requires us to add a …fth con‡ictual regime that has a 50% of probability to move to the monetary-led
regime and 50% to move to the …scally led regime conditional on the con‡ict getting resolved. Furthermore,
we add an additional low-demand regime that leads to this additional con‡ict regime with probability one once
demand becomes high again ( dt = h). As before, conditional on the discrete demand shock being negative, the
probability of moving to one of the …ve low-demand regimes is the same (20%).

the larger the degree of vulnerability of the economy to changes in the private sector’s beliefs
when an institutional con‡ict is expected to arise after the recession. If beliefs about which
authority will win the con‡ict are erratic, the macroeconomic volatility during the recession
and the following con‡ict period may be quite large.

Debt Targeting

To do the exercise in Section 5, we write the linearized equations derived from the model of
Section 3. Nonetheless, we use the policy rules (29)-(30) to describe the policymakers’behavior.
This set of equations describe the actual economy. For the model to be mathematically well
speci…ed, we need to add the equations that capture the law of motion for the targets ^bnd
t 1
nd
and ~ t 1 . This set of equations is exactly the same as the one of the actual economy with the
exception of the Euler equation that reads

Notice that the Euler equation of the shadow economy (44) does not feature the discrete
demand shock d dt . Furthermore, the policy rules (45)-(46) feature the monetary-led parameterization. Furthermore, note that the discrete preference shock does not a¤ect potential output.
Thus, ybt nd = ybt .

Higher Initial Debt-to-Output Ratio

Figure 9 shows the dynamics of the output gap, in‡ation, the federal funds rate, and the debtto-GDP ratio when the coordinated strategy of in‡ating away only the portion of debt resulting
from the recession is implemented. We consider two cases that di¤er from the initial level of
debt. As one can see, the initial level of debt does not a¤ect the dynamics of the output gap,
in‡ation, and interest rate whatsoever. This is because policymakers are committed to following
the monetary-led policy mix to stabilize the pre-existing level of debt. Since taxation is assumed
to be non-distorsive, there are no consequences of …scal adjustments for the macroeconomy in
these cases.
