ABSTRACT
This paper provides experimental evidence for the impact of home internet access on a broad
range of child outcomes in Peru. We compare children who were randomly chosen to receive
laptops with high-speed internet access to (i) those who did not receive laptops and (ii) those who
only received laptops without internet. We find that providing free internet access led to
improved computer and internet proficiency relative to those without laptops and improved
internet proficiency compared to those with laptops only. However, there were no significant
effects of internet access on math and reading achievement, cognitive skills, self-esteem, teacher
perceptions, or school grades when compared to either group. We explore reasons for the absence
of impacts on these key outcomes with survey questions, time-diaries, and computer logs.

1. Introduction
Despite the rapid worldwide expansion of the internet, large disparities in children’s internet access
remain. Internet access is practically universal for children in developed countries: over 95% of
15-year old students in OECD member countries report having a link to the internet at home
(OECD, 2017). In contrast, access to the internet continues to lag for children in developing
countries. For example, less than half of 15-year-old students in Algeria, Peru, and Vietnam report
having internet access at home (OECD, 2017). In an effort to alleviate this “digital divide”, many
government and non-governmental organizations are investing substantial resources to expand
internet access to children in developing countries.1 However, rigorous evidence for the impact of
home internet access on children’s outcomes is currently limited to developed countries and may
not generalize to settings where fewer resources can complement or substitute for technology.2
Accordingly, this paper provides the first experimental evidence for the impact of home internet
access on a broad range of child outcomes in a developing country context.
Internet access can potentially affect a range of skills including academic achievement and
cognitive skills. If children lack educational materials, internet access may improve the
development of academic skills by providing access to educational websites with subject-specific
content and exercises (e.g. Khan Academy). Moreover, children can access e-books and other
reading materials such as newspapers, blogs, and online encyclopedias (e.g. Wikipedia). On the
other hand, internet access may diminish learning if children spend more time on activities that are
not conducive to developing academic skills, such as playing online games, and less time reading

For example, the “Yo Elijo Mi PC” program in Chile provides free internet along with laptops for eligible students.
Numerous national programs subsidize internet access more broadly, e.g. Brazil’s Plano Nacional de Banda Larga.

and doing homework. Finally, internet access may affect cognitive skills by exposing children to
online activities that alter cognitive processes (Johnson 2006; Mills 2014).
To measure the effects of providing internet access, we implemented a randomized
experiment in Lima, Peru, between 2011 and 2013. We first provided access to XO laptops for
home use to a random sample of 540 children enrolled in grades 3 to 5 in low-achieving public
primary schools (in June/July 2011).3 Then, among children who received these laptops, we
randomly selected about 350 children to receive free high-speed internet access (in July/August
2012). The laptops included 32 applications selected by the Ministry of Education of Peru for its
national program, and we offered training and manuals on how to use them. We also offered
tutorials and manuals to children who received internet access in which we showed them how to
take advantage of freely available educational websites created by Peru’s Ministry of Education
and other online resources, such as Khan Academy and Wikipedia.
To evaluate the impacts of our interventions, we conducted a follow up survey in
November 2012, approximately 17 months after the laptops were initially distributed and 5 months
after the provision of internet access. We also conducted an additional follow-up survey in March
2013 to check for longer-run impacts after the summer vacation. In prior work, we examined only
the short-term impact of XO laptops without internet access (Beuermann et al., 2015). In the
current study, we compare (i) children who were randomly chosen to receive laptops with internet
access to (ii) those who did not receive laptops and to (iii) those who only received laptops without
internet. Thus, we are able to estimate the impact of internet access both separately from, and in
conjunction with, the impact of the laptops themselves.

The XO laptops were developed by the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) program with an emphasis on self-empowered
learning and with specialized software intended to encourage such learning.

Our interventions were successful in increasing children’s access to technology at home
and led to substantial improvements in digital skills after just 5 months. Children who were offered
internet access were 30 percentage points more likely to have internet at home as compared to
those who were not offered internet, whether they had laptops or not. Furthermore, children who
were offered internet access scored 0.3 standard deviations higher on a test of internet literacy than
those who were not offered internet access, whether they had laptops or not. They also scored 1
standard deviation higher on a test that measured proficiency on the XO laptop compared to those
who were not offered laptops, but not significantly different from those children who were offered
laptops without internet. In addition, children who were offered laptops (with or without internet)
had significant improvements on a Windows-based computer test, suggesting that gains in
computer literacy were not only limited to the specific XO platform but transferred to skills for
using other types of computers.
Despite the increase in access to technology and the improvements in digital skills, there
were no significant effects of internet access on academic achievement. We can rule out impacts
larger than 0.08 standard deviations in math and 0.13 standard deviations in reading with 95%
confidence when comparing children who were offered internet access to those who did not get
laptops. Nor were there any significant effects on a broad set of cognitive skills, as measured by
the Raven’s Progressive Matrices test, a verbal fluency test, a test of executive functioning, a
coding test, a working memory test and a test of spatial reasoning. Similarly, we did not find
significant effects on a self-esteem index measured by a self-reported questionnaire. Based on
teacher reports, children in the treatment groups were equally likely to exert effort at school when
compared with their counterparts in the control group, and there were no differences on grades
obtained from administrative school records or in teacher perceptions of children’s sociability.

3

There was also no evidence of improvements when we resurveyed children 8 to 9 months after
internet provision following the summer vacation, despite the potential benefits of engaging
children with the internet to counteract summer learning loss.4
Why were there no significant impacts on academic achievement and cognitive skills from
providing children with internet access? Though we cannot provide a definitive answer to this
question, we consider a number of possible explanations. First, while the intervention itself was
not directly linked with pedagogical activities at school, we did provide children with tutorials and
manuals to make more effective use of their computers and the internet for educational purposes.
Second, while we do not have long-term outcomes, previous research has shown that new
technology can have short-term impacts within a year (Malamud and Pop-Eleches, 2011; Banerjee
et al. 2007) or even just several months (Muralidharan, et al., 2016). Third, it is possible that the
impact on internet use was not sufficiently large. The provision of internet led to initial increases
in use but our computer and internet logs reveal a decline over time. Approximately 5 months after
being offered internet access, the fraction of children who report using the internet anywhere in
the previous week remained significantly higher among those who were offered internet access,
but the difference was only 6 percentage points. Nevertheless, children who were offered laptops
with internet access remained 22 percentage points more likely to use internet at home during the
previous week compared to those who were offered only laptops, with 8 percentage points in lower
use at internet cafés.
So how did children use their home computers and what was the effect on time spent on
other activities? We use data from computer and internet logs to show that computer and internet

Many studies find that students score lower on the same standardized tests at the end of the summer than at the
beginning of the summer, often referred to as summer learning loss. See Alexander et al. (2016) for a collection of
recent contributions to the literature on summer learning loss.

use was focused more on entertainment than on learning. This happened in spite of our efforts to
promote internet use for educational purposes through the provision of training, tutorials and
manuals. Furthermore, although the time diaries do not reveal large and consistent changes in the
time spent on other activities, there is some evidence of a reduction in time spent watching TV and
doing homework. Overall, our analysis underscores the null effects of increasing internet access
on the development of academic and cognitive skills, and suggests the need for parents to ensure
that technological resources are used in ways that foster better educational outcomes.
There are a few recent studies that estimate the causal impact of home internet access on
children’s outcomes, but all are based in developed countries.5 Fairlie and Robinson (2013) find
no impacts of home computers with subsidized dial-up internet access on standardized tests or
grades using a randomized experiment in California.6 Vigdor et al. (2014) exploit local variations
in broadband internet penetration in North Carolina to show that children who live in areas that
receive additional internet providers experience a modest but significant decline in mathematics
test scores (and insignificant decline in reading). Lastly, Faber et al. (2016) exploit differences in
broadband connection speeds across neighboring residences in England and find no significant
impacts on test scores or time spent studying. However, to our knowledge, no previous study has
separately identified the added effect of home internet access in an experimental setting.
Accordingly, this paper makes several contributions to the existing literature on technology
in education. First, this study represents the first randomized experiment exploring the effects of
home internet access implemented in a developing country. Focusing on this setting is especially

Papers that examine the causal impact of home computers without internet access on children’s outcomes in
developing countries include Malamud and Pop-Eleches (2011), Mo et al. (2013) and Beuermann et al. (2015). Papers
that evaluate the causal impact of school-based internet access in developing countries include Kho, Lakdawala, and
Nakasone (2018) and Sprietsma (2007).

Using this same experiment, Fairlie and Kalil (2016) find positive impacts on the likelihood of having a social
networking site and time spent communicating with friends, but no effects on school participation and engagement.

policy relevant given that governments and households in the developing world are making
significant investments to expand internet connectivity.7 Second, because our individual-level
randomization includes almost 2,000 children with follow-up data, we can provide relatively
precise estimates of impacts on a variety of short and medium-term outcomes. Third, our study
includes a broad range of outcomes, including not only academic achievement measures but also
a full set of cognitive skills tests, teachers’ assessments, time diaries and school grades records.
Finally, we use detailed information from computer logs of applications and internet sites that
provide objective measures to help us better understand the “black box” of computer use.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the experimental design and
implementation of the interventions. Section 3 explains our data collection efforts and the
empirical strategy we use to analyze the data. Section 4 presents the main impacts of our
interventions. Section 5 attempts to open the “black box” of our interventions using survey
questions, time-diaries, and computer logs. Section 6 provides a summary of our findings and
concludes.

2. Experimental Design
Our experimental study was implemented in several steps. We began by randomly selecting 14
schools from a sample of low-achieving public primary schools.8 Within these schools, we
provided laptops for home use to a random sample of children who were in third to fifth grade in
2011. Then, among children that won laptops, we randomly provided high-speed internet access

The yearly cost of providing (high-speed) internet access is now higher than the cost of most lower-end laptop and
desktop computers in many countries: see https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/11/22/the-most-andleast-expensive-countries-for-broadband-infographic/.
8
These schools all had morning shifts which enrolled between 400 and 800 students, 4 classes per grade or fewer, a
ratio of school computers to students lower than 0.15, and a classroom available for a computer lab in the afternoon.

to a sub-sample of them. The specific timeline of the study is as follows (and shown in Online
Appendix Figure A1). We collected baseline data in April/May 2011 and conducted the lottery
(and delivered laptops) in June/July 2011. Training for the laptop and a manual for children was
offered in August/September 2011. We provided internet access in July/August 2012. Training on
internet use and a manual for children was offered in September 2012. Finally, we collected follow
up data in November 2012 and March 2013. Note that Peru’s academic school year runs from
March to December. It is worth noting that the Ministry of Education had automatically blocked
the XO laptops during the first summer of the project (January to March 2012). However, in order
to measure the longer-run effects through March 2013, we obtained a waiver, and the laptops were
not blocked during the second summer (January to March 2013). The remainder of this section
describes the interventions in more detail.

2.1 Laptops
We first offered XO laptops for home use to 540 randomly selected children in grades 3 to 5.9 In
June/July 2011, we conducted public lotteries for 4 laptops within each class among children
whose parents provided written consent. The lotteries were conducted in class and parents were
invited to attend in order to assure transparency. These procedures were developed in close
coordination with schools, principals, and teachers. The XO laptops were provided by the Ministry
of Education of Peru and specifically designed to be used by primary-aged students in developing

In total, 1048 laptops were distributed to children in grades 1 to 6. However, we focus on children in 3rd to 5th grade
because of the difficulties in collecting reliable baseline information from 1st and 2nd grades, and the challenge of
tracking 6th graders who moved on to secondary school by the time of the follow-up survey.

countries. The laptops had 512 MB of RAM, 2 GB of flash storage, and a Linux operating system.
The graphical interface, known as Sugar, was designed to be used by children.10
Thirty-two applications, selected by the Ministry of Education for nationwide use, were
installed in the distributed laptops. The applications included standard applications such as word
processor, drawing software, and calculator; educational games including Tetris, Sudoku and a
variety of puzzles; applications to create, edit and play music; two programming environments;
and other applications including sound and video recording and certain sections of Wikipedia. The
laptops were also pre-loaded with age-appropriate e-books selected by the Ministry of Education.
We provided all beneficiary children with an instruction manual and the opportunity to
attend training sessions. The manual was designed for primary school children, with graphical
illustrations about how to use the laptop and in-depth practical instruction for 10 governmentprioritized applications. Weekly training sessions took place in each school for a seven-week
period in August and September 2011. On each Saturday during the training period, there were
three two-hour sessions for children arranged by grade. Children did not receive help with
schoolwork or any other instruction during these sessions. Average student attendance was about
50 percent, and approximately 70 percent of children attended at least one session.

2.2 Internet
We provided high-speed internet access to a subset of laptop lottery winners who were studying
in grades 3 to 5 during the 2011 school year. This intervention was conducted in July and August
of 2012, approximately 13 months after the start of the first intervention.11 We randomly chose

The laptops do not run Windows and they are not compatible with software designed for that operating system.
However, most files (e.g., images, sound and text documents) are compatible with the XO environment.

Note that this intervention was only announced in June 2012, so children and parents were not aware of this
intervention until immediately prior to the start of the intervention itself.

two among the children that were offered laptops in each class and offered them a high-speed
internet connection for the XO laptop.12 Specifically, we randomly sorted the children who were
initially offered laptops and offered internet access to children ranked first and second. If either of
these children ended up not receiving internet access (e.g. because the parents did not attend the
session when the equipment was provided), we offered internet access to the child ranked in the
third position. If two of the children ranked first to third did not receive internet access, then we
offered this service to the child ranked fourth. Approximately 80 percent of the internet
connections were provided to children ranked first or second––see Online Appendix Table A4. All
children who were offered internet access are considered as treated for the purposes of our ITT
estimates (as described later).
In total, 354 children were offered high-speed internet access at home for eight months
until March 2013. We provided 8 additional training sessions and a manual to help children take
full advantage of the internet access. The manuals contained guidelines on using the internet safely,
tutorials for educational websites produced by Peru’s Ministry of Education, instructions on how
to search for information using Wikipedia and other virtual libraries, as well as links to Khan
Academy and other educational resources. However, children did not receive any help with
schoolwork during these sessions. We also attempted to minimize the possibility of exposure to
adult content by blocking certain websites and providing guidelines for use to children and parents.

3. Data and Empirical Strategy
3.1 Data

12

Internet access was provided through Claro, a major telecommunications company in Peru.

9

The primary data used in this evaluation were collected directly in baseline and follow-up
surveys.13 We conducted a baseline survey among children in targeted schools during April/May
2011 and collected information on basic demographics, computer literacy, computer and internet
use, time use, and detailed information about social networks, as well as a test of cognitive skills
(Raven’s Progressive Matrices) and standardized tests in math and language ability. We also
surveyed teachers on their perceptions of student sociability, effort devoted in class, and expected
educational attainment.
A first follow-up survey was conducted in November 2012, approximately 5 months after
the provision of internet access. It covered most of the topics examined in the baseline survey plus
a battery of cognitive tests including (i) a general cognitive test based on the Colored Raven’s
Progressive Matrices test together with an additional set of more difficult pattern-recognition
questions, (ii) a test of verbal fluency that requires children to list all the words they can think of
starting with a particular letter (“P”) in three minutes, (iii) a coding test similar to the one in the
Wechsler test, (iv) a test of spatial reasoning based on mental rotation exercises, (v) a working
memory test, and (vi) a short test of executive functioning: the Stroop test measuring cognitive
interference. We also tested children in three domains of digital skills: (i) proficiency in the use of
the XO laptops, (ii) competence in operating a Windows-based computer, and (iii) knowledge and
use of the internet. In addition, we administered a detailed time diary to a subsample of 838
children in November 2012 who had attended 4th grade at baseline. These children were
interviewed individually and were asked to mention each activity performed during a 24-hour

In addition, we used administrative data at the school level from the Peruvian Education Statistics Unit and
individual-level standardized tests from Student Census Evaluation (ECE) at the Ministry of Education of Peru for the
initial selection of schools.

period starting at 7 am the prior day. We supplemented this follow-up survey by collecting official
school records on grades corresponding to the 2012 academic year.
A second follow up survey was conducted in March 2013, approximately 8 to 9 months
after the provision of internet access and shortly before families were required to return their
laptops to the school.14 Children were administered an abridged questionnaire similar to the one in
the previous follow-up, and tested on their digital skills, math and reading ability and one of the
cognitive tests (Raven’s progressive matrices).
Finally, we extracted log files from the laptops for approximately two-thirds of the XO
beneficiaries (with parental consent). This enables us to examine detailed patterns of use in an
objective manner without relying on subjective reports from children. The logs recorded the date
and time when each session started as well as roughly when every application was opened. They
also provide information about every internet site visited by children on these computers.

3.2 Empirical Strategy
The empirical framework for our main analysis involves two different comparisons. First, we
compare children who were randomly offered laptops with internet access (“Laptop+Internet”
treatment) to those who did not win laptops (“No Laptop” control group). Second, we compare
children who were randomly offered laptops with internet access (“Laptop+Internet” treatment) to
children who won laptops but were not offered internet access (“Laptop Only” control group). We
can estimate both of these impacts jointly using the following regression model:
′
𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝛿1 𝐿𝑎𝑝𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝛿2 (𝐿𝑎𝑝𝑡𝑜𝑝+𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑒𝑡)𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑘
𝛽 + 𝜂𝑗 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘

(1)

This survey was only administered to children who attended 3rd and 4th grade in 2011. This because students who
were in 5th grade in 2011 graduated from primary school in December 2012 and we were no longer able to track them.
14

11

where 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘 denotes an outcome of interest for child i, in class j and school k observed at follow-up.
𝐿𝑎𝑝𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑘 is an indicator which takes the value of 1 if child i in class j and school k won a
laptop but was not offered home internet access, and 0 otherwise. 𝐿𝑎𝑝𝑡𝑜𝑝+𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑘 is a
treatment indicator which takes the value of 1 if child i in class j and school k won a laptop and
was offered internet access, and 0 otherwise. The omitted category is the “No Laptop” control
group. Thus, 𝛿2 captures the impact of providing internet access for children who neither have
access to the internet or to a laptop; and 𝛿3 = 𝛿2 − 𝛿1 captures the impact of providing internet
access for children who have access to a laptop without internet access (i.e. the added effect of
internet over and above the effect of having a laptop only).15
In our preferred specifications, 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑘 only includes a constant and the baseline value of the
corresponding outcome variable (when available) to help improve precision. However, our results
are unchanged by the inclusion of additional baseline covariates or by excluding the baseline value
of the outcome variables. We always include a class lottery fixed effect, 𝜂𝑗 , since the individual
randomization was carried out class by class. Finally, 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘 is an error term that allows for
heteroscedasticity across observations.

3.3 Analytical Sample
The main sample used to analyze the effects measured in November 2012 includes 2,126 children
attending grades 3 to 5 at baseline whose parents provided consents for participating in the

′
This second comparison can be estimated directly by 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝛾1 𝐿𝑎𝑝𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝛾2 𝑁𝑜𝐿𝑎𝑝𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑘
𝛽 + 𝜂𝑗 +
𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘 ; where the omitted category is the group of children in the “Laptop+Internet” treatment. Then, reversing the signs
of the main coefficients in this regression equation, we get that 𝛿2 = −𝛾2 and 𝛿3 = 𝛿2 − 𝛿1 = −𝛾1 .

study.16,17 Of these, 1,653 are in the “No Laptop” group, 163 are in the “Laptop Only” group and
310 are in the “Laptop+Internet” group. The attrition rate in this sample from the corresponding
baseline sample is 13 percent, and not statistically different across treatment arms.18,19 Figure 1
describes how we arrived at this final sample from our original sample in more detail and shows
the level of compliance within each treatment arm (Online Appendix Figure A2 shows the
analogous sample composition for the longer-run follow-up).

[Figure 1 here]

Table 1 provides evidence that the within-school randomization was successful in
generating balance between treatment and control groups for our analytical sample.20 Columns 1,
2, and 3 present the means of the baseline characteristics for the “No Laptop”, “Laptop Only”, and
“Laptop+Internet” groups respectively. Column 4 shows the estimated difference between the
“Laptop+Internet” group and the “No Laptop” group while Column 5 shows the estimated
difference between the “Laptop+Internet” group and the “Laptop Only” group. Among the 42
estimated differences between treatment and control groups, only two were significant at the five
percent level or lower. Thus, the randomization of computers and internet was successful in

Online Appendix Table A3 shows that children whose parents consented to the study had significantly lower
probability of having phone, electricity, computer and internet access but higher scores in reading, cognitive skills,
and teacher assessments than those whose parents did not consent.
17
This analytical sample is restricted to observations with non-missing values for the corresponding variables at
baseline and follow-up so that we have consistent samples in our balance and outcome tables. Our results are
essentially unchanged when we relax this restriction, as shown in Online Appendix Table A5.
18
The likelihood of attrition in the November 2012 survey was slightly higher for males, those without siblings, and
lower math scores at baseline. However, these characteristics predict attrition similarly across treatment arms.
19
The attrition rate in the March 2013 follow-up survey was closer to 25 percent, but also not significantly different
across treatment arms. See Online Appendix Table A1 for the differential likelihood of attrition across treatment arms.
20
Note that Table 1 shows balance for children that were observed at both baseline and follow-up. Online Appendix
Table A2 shows that baseline characteristics are also balanced for the full sample of randomized children at baseline
(including those who were not observed at follow-up).

creating balanced treatment and control groups to consistently identify the effects of the
intervention through equation (1).

[Table 1 here]

All our results are based on intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates; that is, we consider children
who were randomly assigned to the “Laptop Only” or “Laptop+Internet” groups whether or not
they actually received a laptop or internet access. Given the 95 percent take-up rate of laptops and
the 81 percent take-up rate of internet in our analytical sample, the ITT estimates are relatively
similar in magnitude to the treatment on the treated (TOT) estimates that scale up our estimates by
the rates of take-up.21 However, scaling up the estimates by the rates of computer and internet
access and use reported by children, as discussed in sections 4.1 and 4.2, would yield substantially
larger impacts.

4. Main Impacts
This section presents the estimated impacts of our interventions on computer access and use,
internet access and use, computer and internet skills, academic achievement, cognitive skills, selfesteem, school grades, and other teacher assessments. Most of the tables are structured in a similar
fashion: the means of outcomes for the “No Laptop,” “Laptop Only,” and “Laptop+Internet”
groups are shown in columns 1, 2, and 3 respectively; the difference between the
“Laptop+Internet” group and the “No Laptop” group in column 4; and the difference between the
“Laptop+Internet” group and the “Laptop Only” group in column 5.
We have estimated equation (1) instrumenting actual take-up with the indicators for random assignment and results
remain mostly unchanged. These results are available upon request.

4.1 Computer Access and Use
Panel A of Table 2 presents our findings related to self-reported computer access and use. Column
4 shows that children randomly assigned to receive laptops with internet access were
approximately 40 percentage points more likely to report having a computer at home compared to
those in the “No Laptop” group. This represents a large and significant effect on access to home
computers but it is noteworthy that 54 percent of children in the “No Laptop” control group already
own a computer.22 Unsurprisingly, column 5 shows no significant impact of simply providing
internet access on computer ownership relative to children in the “Laptop Only” group who were
provided laptops without internet access.

[Table 2 here]

There were also significant differences in computer use when comparing children in the
“Laptop+Internet” group to those in the “No Laptop” group in column 4. Consistent with the nature
of our intervention, children who were randomly assigned to receive laptops with internet were 33
percentage points more likely to use computers at home during the previous week compared to
those in the “No Laptop” group. However, these same children in the “Laptop+Internet” group
were 13, and 7 percentage points less likely to use computers in internet cafes, and friend’s houses
respectively than those in the “No Laptop” group. Therefore, it seems that children who won a
laptop and internet access substituted computer use at home for use outside the home. Again,

Note that only 43 percent of children in the control group report having a home computer at baseline, suggesting
that some of them acquired a computer after (and, perhaps, because of) our intervention. Although we did not collect
information about the nature of other computers in the household, these are unlikely to be XO laptops since such
computers were not commercially available.
22

15

except for a 9 percentage points reduction in the likelihood of using computers in internet cafes,
column 5 shows no significant impacts of providing internet access on computer use relative to
children in the “Laptop Only” group.

4.2 Internet Access and Use
Panel B of Table 2 presents our findings on self-reported internet access and use. Compared to
children in either the “Laptop Only” or “No Laptop” group in columns 4 and 5 respectively, those
randomly assigned to receive laptops with internet were 30 to 33 percentage points more likely to
report having internet at home. Thus, the internet intervention was successful in increasing
connectivity. Nevertheless, around 40 to 44 percent of children in the control groups also report
access to the internet (this fraction was around 31 to 34 percent at baseline).23
We also observe that the internet intervention led to increased internet utilization at home.
Children in the “Laptop+Internet” group were 27 and 22 percentage points more likely to report
using internet at home during the previous week compared to those in the “No Laptop” and
“Laptop Only” group respectively. However, those children who were randomly assigned laptops
with internet access did report a decrease in the likelihood of using internet in internet cafés (a
significant decrease of 10 percentage points when compared to the “No Laptop” group). This
suggests that there was some substitution away from internet use outside the home and towards
internet use on children’s personal computers.

4.3 Skills

These rates of internet access are similar to home internet penetration of 36 percent among households in
Metropolitan Lima in 2012 based on the Peruvian National Household Survey. This penetration is higher than in other
regions of Peru (especially the poorer highlands and Amazon regions where rates are below 10 percent).
23

Table 3 presents the impacts of internet access on a broad set of skills. Compared to children in
the “No Laptop” group, those who were randomly assigned to receive laptops with internet access
scored 1 standard deviation higher on an “XO test” measuring XO-specific laptop knowledge
(column 4). Similarly, we observe a positive impact on a “PC test” which measured skills related
to using a Windows-based computer. Children in the “Laptop+Internet” group scored 0.21
standard deviations higher than those in the “No Laptop” group. It thus appears that XO skills are
transferable (at least to some degree) to Window-based platforms. However, there is no additional
impact of internet access over and above the effect of receiving a laptop without internet access
for either the XO test or the PC test (column 5). This confirms that the provision of internet access
itself did not improve those digital skills that were not specifically related to internet use.

[Table 3 here]

In our “Internet test” of internet knowledge and skills, we observe that children in the
“Laptop+Internet” group scored 0.33 and 0.26 standard deviations higher than those in the “No
Laptop” and “Laptop Only” groups respectively. This confirms that the internet intervention
served to improve children’s internet skills. In other words, the impact on internet skills is almost
wholly captured by the additional impact of internet access over and above the effect of receiving
a laptop without internet access. The combined impact of our XO test, PC test, and internet test is
captured by a digital skills index that is also standardized accordingly. We attempted to gauge the
magnitude of our impacts on digital skills by comparing them to differences in digital skills
between children with and without home computers and internet in the control group. We find that

17

providing children with access to computers and internet at home effectively closes the gap in
digital skills between those with and without home computers.
We administered standardized math and reading tests, but we did not find significant
impacts of providing internet access relative to either control group. These estimated impacts of
zero are also quite precise. None of the estimates are larger than 0.05 standard deviations in
magnitude. Using our academic achievement index which combines the standardized scores in
math and reading, we can rule out positive impacts larger than 0.08 standard deviations with 95%
confidence when comparing children with internet access to those who did not get laptops. This is
consistent with previous evidence provided by Beuermann et al. (2015) and Cristia et al. (2017).
We also administered a battery of cognitive tests which included the Raven’s Progressive Matrices,
verbal fluency, executive functioning, coding, working memory, and spatial reasoning. Again, our
results reveal no impacts of providing internet access compared to either of the control groups.
Using our cognitive skills index which combines the standardized scores across all of these tests,
we can rule out positive impacts larger than 0.09 standard deviations with 95% confidence when
comparing children with internet access to those who did not get laptops. This contrasts with
previous findings in Malamud and Pop-Eleches (2011) and Cristia et al. (2017) who found
significant effects of exposure to computers on the Raven’s Progressive Matrices test. Finally, we
applied a survey instrument that yielded a self-esteem index but also found no evidence of
significant effects.24

4.4 Grades and Teachers’ Perceptions

There is an extensive literature in psychology examining the effect of the internet on social involvement and
psychological well-being, starting with a seminal paper by Kraut et al. (1998).
24

18

Table 4 presents results based on teacher evaluations. We collected administrative data regarding
official school grades for the 2012 academic year running from March to December. We computed
indicators for the likelihood of being promoted to the next grade (Pass grade), for being assigned
to summer school because of poor performance during the academic year (Need summer school),
and for failing the academic year (Fail grade). We also computed the percentage of courses in
which students obtained the highest possible letter grade awarded by their teacher (Percentage of
top grades). Columns 4 and 5 in the top panel of Table 4 shows that there are no significant impacts
of providing internet access on any of these measures.

[Table 4 here]

We also surveyed teachers on their perceptions of their students’ social popularity, effort
at school and expected educational attainment.25 For the first two dimensions, we asked teachers
how they evaluate each pupil in their classroom: below average, average, or above average.
Regarding educational expectations, the options reported by teachers consisted of whether the
child was expected to attain primary, secondary or post-secondary education. We then constructed
summary indicators that take the value of one if the teacher reported the highest possible outcome
for the pupil and zero otherwise. As shown in the bottom panel of Table 4, we did not observe any
significant impact of providing internet access on teacher’s perceptions of social popularity or
effort at school (although there was a marginally significant difference of 5 percentage points

25
Teachers’ perceptions could have been affected if they knew their students’ treatment status. However, this is not
likely because of several reasons. First, internet randomization was conducted privately by the research team and only
internet winners were contacted. Second, laptops were provided for home use and students were not allowed to take
them to school. Third, most of the teachers surveyed did not witness the initial provision of computers in 2012 because
this took place in the prior year and teachers typically do not follow the same cohort of students over time.

19

between the “Laptop+Internet” and the “No Laptop” groups in the likelihood of expecting the child
to complete university education).

4.5 Heterogeneous effects
In addition to showing the average impacts of the intervention on the full sample, we also looked
for heterogeneous effects by individual characteristics. We focused on differences by gender and
baseline academic achievement, as shown in Table 5.26 The impact of our interventions on access
and use of home computers and internet by gender is similar. Girls show higher impacts on digital
skills as compared to boys, although these differences are not significant at the 5 percent level.
There are no statistically significant impacts on academic achievement, cognitive skills, and socioemotional skills for either girls or boys with the exception of the effects of internet provision on
socio-emotional skills for girls. We also looked whether there were statistically significant
differential effects between boys and girls for the outcomes presented in Table 5 and could not
reject that the effects are similar across genders at the 5 percent level with the sole exception of
the effect of internet provision on socio-emotional skills (larger for girls).

[Table 5 here]

The impact of our interventions on access and use of home computers by baseline academic
achievement is also similar, with slightly higher rates for children with higher baseline
achievement. The impacts on digital skills are larger for children with higher baseline achievement,

Previous research by Banerjee et al. (2007), Bai et al. (2016), and Mo et al. (2015) suggests there may be
heterogeneous impacts of technology by baseline ability and gender. On the other hand, Linden (2008) and
Muralidharan et al. (2016) did not find significantly different impacts by these characteristics.

26

20

and significantly different from those with lower baseline achievement in the Laptop+Internet
group. Again, there are no significant impacts on academic achievement, cognitive skills, and
socio-emotional skills for either high or low achievers with the exception of positive effects of
internet provision on academic achievement for high achievers. Moreover, we checked whether
there are differential statistically significant effects across low and high achievers and found that
we cannot reject that the effects are the same with the exception of a larger effect of internet
provision on internet use for high achievers.
Online Appendix Table A6 presents the differential impacts of our intervention by prior
computer and internet access. Not surprisingly, the impacts on access and use of home computers
are larger in magnitude for children that reported no baseline availability of a computer or internet
at home. However, positive effects on digital skills are similar regardless of baseline access and
there are no significant impacts on academic achievement, cognitive skills, or socio-emotional
skills for any of these subgroups. Finally, Online Appendix Table A7 presents the differential
impacts of our intervention by children’s grade at baseline. The estimated impacts are mostly
similar by grade, although the effects on use and digital skills appear to be larger for the youngest
cohorts in a few cases.

4.6 Longer-run effects
The results from the second follow-up survey in March 2013 are presented in Table 6, and mostly
mirror the main findings from the earlier follow-up survey conducted in November 2012. We
continue to observe a pronounced impact of our interventions on measures of digital skills.
Children in the “Laptop+Internet” group scored over 1 standard deviations higher than those in the
“No Laptop” group on a test of XO proficiency, and 0.30 standard deviations higher on a test of

21

internet proficiency. However, as in our earlier survey, there were no significant effects on
academic achievement in math and reading, scores on the Raven’s Progressive Matrices test, or on
our measure of self-esteem.

[Table 6 here]

4.7 Spillovers
We also checked for the possibility of spillover effects by taking advantage of social network data
reported by all children at baseline. In particular, we focused on children who did not win the XO
lottery and split them into three subgroups: (i) those reported as close friends of children who won
the XO lottery and were assigned to receive internet access, (ii) those reported as close friends
only of children who won the XO lottery but were not assigned to receive internet access, and (iii)
those not mentioned as a close friend of any child who won the lottery.27 Under the assumption
that children who were not close friends with the lottery winners experienced little or no spillovers,
we can interpret the differences between groups (i) and (ii) and between groups (i) and (iii) as
alternative measures of the spillover effect of internet access. However, Online Appendix Table
A8 indicates no significant spillover effects.28

28
We cannot rule out the possibility that internet-connected laptops generated positive externalities to everyone in the
school (regardless of how closely they were connected to the lottery winners). However, in previous work, Beuermann
et al. (2015) showed relatively little evidence of such spillovers for laptops without internet access.

In this section, we explore some of the possible mechanisms that may explain why we do not
observe significant impacts of internet access on the key child outcomes in our study. To do this,
we use traditional survey questions, as well as detailed time-diaries, and computer logs that capture
information about which laptop applications were used and which internet websites were visited
by the children who received XO laptops.

5.1 Time Use
Table 7 shows the impact of internet access on a broad set of activities measured through time
diaries applied to a random sub-sample of 837 children who were in 4th grade at baseline. These
measures represent the number of minutes that the child reported being engaged in each activity
during the previous day. Columns 1, 2, and 3 show that time spent on computer or laptop is
substantially lower than the time spent watching TV, doing homework, playing without a computer
or even doing domestic chores. Across all three groups, the reported time spent on a computer or
laptop ranges from 20 to 34 minutes per day.
Nevertheless, the provision of internet access does lead to significantly more time spent
using a computer or laptop based on the children reports. Relative to the children in the “No
Laptop” group, those who were randomly assigned to receive laptops with internet used a computer
an additional 13 minutes per day, or 1.5 hours per week. This represents an increase of over 60
percent, and very similar to the impact on the reported number of minutes spent using a computer
specifically at home. Relative to the children in the “Laptop Only” group, the impact is smaller
and insignificant, at about 5 minutes per day, or half an hour per week. Still, despite the lack of
significance, this represents an increase of over 15 percent.

23

[Table 7 here]

There is some evidence that providing internet access leads to substitution away from other
activities. We see that children in the “Laptop+Internet” group spend almost 30 minutes less time
watching TV as compared to those in the “Laptop Only” group. Meanwhile, children in the
“Laptop+Internet” group spend about 8 minutes less time doing homework as compared to those
in the “No Laptop” group. However, there are also instances where exposure to internet appears
to increase time spent on certain activities (e.g. domestic chores, working outside the home), albeit
not significantly. It is possible that internet access makes children more efficient at completing
homework assignments such that they spend less time on homework and frees up time for other
activities. In terms of the type of computer use that children are engaged in, we observe increases
of 5 and 8 minutes per day on computer games relative to the “No Laptop” and “Laptop Only”
groups, and an increase of about 7 minutes per day using computers for homework as compared
to the “No Laptop” group.

5.2 Type of computer and internet use
We also examine how children use their computers and the internet in more detail in Table 8.
Compared to those in the “No Laptop” group, children who were randomly assigned to receive
laptops with internet were significantly more likely to use their computers to do homework (10
percentage points) and to play games (11 percentage points). There were also positive impacts of
internet access over and above the effect of having a laptop itself in terms of using the computer
to watch videos (11 percentage points) but a negative effect on using it to listen to music (10
percentage points).

24

[Table 8 here]

Regarding how children use the internet, we observe that those in the “Laptop+Internet”
group are significantly more likely to use the internet to search for information (13 percentage
points) and watch videos (11 percentage points) relative to those in the “Laptop Only” group.
There is also evidence that those in the “Laptop+Internet” group were more prone to play online
games, search information, and use educational programs than those in the “No Laptop” group.

5.3 Activity Logs
In addition to time-use diaries and survey questions about time-use, we gathered more objective
assessments of computer use through log files which record the date and time when each
application is opened. We focus on a measure of extensive use based on the fraction of days in
which a particular application, or set of applications, is opened.29 Furthermore, we classify
applications into four broad categories to facilitate the analysis: entertainment, learning,
information, and communication. However, because these log files were only available for 290
children who received free laptops, this might not be a completely representative sample. Indeed,
Online Appendix Table A9 shows that children whose logs were obtained appear to have
somewhat lower reading scores and higher computer access at baseline compared to their
counterparts without logs, although these differences are only marginally significant.30
These logs also recorded the date and time when every application is closed so it is possible to estimate the intensive
margin of use in terms of minutes, although this is an upper bound because we cannot be certain that children were
actually using the computer throughout the time that an application remained open. Using this alternative measure
yields results that are broadly similar to those from extensive margin.
30
Online Appendix Table A10 also reveals some baseline differences between the “Laptop Only” and the
“Laptop+internet” treatments among children for whom we have computer logs, although only two (out of 19
estimated coefficients) are significant at the 10 percent level.
29

25

Figure 2 uses these logs to show how computer use evolved over the course of our study
for children who received laptops with and without internet access. During July/August 2011,
immediately after children received their laptops, laptop use was relatively high. Specifically,
laptops were used on average 40 percent of days. However, there was a steady decline over the
subsequent months so that, by December 2011, laptop use was only 16 percent. Following the
distribution of internet access to a subsample of children in July/August 2012, their levels of use
increased sharply while those who did not receive internet access reduced use even further. These
patterns are consistent with strong novelty effects, especially considering that laptop use for those
that received internet access also decreased over time. 31

[Figure 2 here]

The specific types of use are disaggregated in Table 9 which presents data based on logs
collected from July to November 2012 (i.e. after internet was provided). Children who received a
laptop without internet access opened computer applications on 17 percent of days. Among
children who also received internet access, this level of use was over 11 percentage points, or 65
percent, higher. And unsurprisingly, the increase in use was dominated by internet applications.
Among the non-internet applications, those classified as entertainment represented the largest
category of use, though closely followed by learning applications. Of course, even these learning
applications were educational games that were available on the XO platform chosen by the
Ministry of Education. The use of applications associated with either information or
communication was substantially lower. These patterns are also disaggregated by gender and
We cannot rule out the possibility that the log files capture use by other family members. However, we do observe
that use during school days is concentrated after school hours (i.e. between 2pm-10pm).

access in Online Appendix Table A12.

[Table 9 here]

5.4 Internet Logs
Our activity logs were supplemented by internet logs which recorded the date and time when each
website was accessed. We constructed an analogous measure of use based on the fraction of days
on which a particular website, or set of websites, is opened. We also classified the websites into
the same broad categories of entertainment, learning, information, and communication. Table 10
describes the patterns of internet use among the 119 children who received internet access, logs
were recovered, and had effective internet activity within the period in which internet was
provided. Table 10 also disaggregates internet use by gender, baseline academic achievement, and
baseline internet access.

[Table 10 here]

As with the evidence from the activity logs, the largest category of internet websites is
classified as entertainment, although communication is almost as large (and, indeed, identical
when rounding). The websites classified within the information and learning categories were
visited much less often. This is also reflected in the specific websites visited, with Facebook,
Youtube, and Twitter being the most popular sites. The use of communication-related websites,
and Facebook in particular, was especially high among girls in our sample. Furthermore, children

27

who did not have prior access to the internet showed higher use in every category as compared to
those that already had access prior to our interventions.

6. Conclusion
This paper examines the effect of internet access on the development of children’s academic,
cognitive, and digital skills. We present findings from a randomized experiment in which free
laptops and internet were provided for home use to children in Lima, Peru. These interventions
were successful in increasing children’s exposure to technology at home and led to substantial
improvements in digital skills. We find that children who were randomly chosen to receive laptops
with internet access showed higher computer and internet proficiency relative to those who did not
receive laptops. They also had higher internet proficiency compared to those who received laptops
without internet. On the other hand, we did not observe any significant impacts on academic
achievement and on a large battery of cognitive skills. There were also no impacts on children’s
grades or on teacher’s assessments of their sociability, academic effort and expectations of their
eventual educational attainment.
We explore the reasons for the lack of impacts, showing that while computer and internet
use do increase significantly following our respective interventions, there is a pronounced drop in
use over time. Moreover, computer use remains substantially lower than reported time spent
watching TV, playing without a computer and doing domestic chores, and we do not find much
evidence of substitution away from these activities. We also find that the largest category of
computer use is entertainment. Thus, providing children with computers and internet at home
appears to engage children in digital activities that are focused less on information or learning and
more on entertainment that do not translate into improved academic achievement, cognitive or

28

socio-emotional skills. It is important to recognize that our results are context-dependent.
Providing home internet access in other settings may produce positive (or negative) effects on
academic achievement and cognitive skills depending on how internet is used, whether there is
access to other learning platforms, and when children’s internet access is supervised more closely.
Our results do indicate that providing children with access to computers and internet at
home (together with some training) effectively closes the gap in digital skills between those with
and without home computers and internet. Therefore, to the extent that improving children’s digital
skills is a relevant goal for an educational system, providing access to computers and internet at
home may be one way to achieve this. However, it may also be possible to achieve these gains at
a lower cost. For example, Bet et al. (2014) show sizeable increases in digital skills from relatively
minor increases in access to shared computers at schools in Peru. There is also some evidence that
the provision of school-based internet can generate gains in student learning (Kho, Lakdawala, and
Nakasone, 2018; Sprietsma, 2007). Perhaps the utilization of school-based internet is monitored
more closely than internet at home. In contrast, increased access to such technology at home in
circumstances similar to those analyzed in this paper, does not appear to improve academic
achievement, cognitive or socio-emotional skills, which are arguably the more important outcomes
of such interventions.

Notes : This table presents statistics and estimated differences between laptop + internet winners (treatment group), non-winners (control group 1), and laptop
only winners (control group 2) who participated in the laptop lottery. Column (1) presents control group 1 means; column (2) presents control group 2 means;
column (3) presents treated group means; column (4) presents estimated adjusted differences and standard errors between the treatment group and control group
1; column (5) presents estimated adjusted differences and standard errors between the treatment group and control group 2. Estimates in columns (4) and (5)
result from OLS regressions with class fixed-effects. OLS regressions are restricted to students who comply with the following requirements: (a) participated in
the laptop lottery; (b) third to fifth grade at baseline; (c) answered the specific outcome of interest at baseline and follow-up. Scores in Digital skills, Academic
achievement, and Cognitive skills are normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of non-winners who participated in the laptop
lottery. Baseline data was collected in April 2011 and follow-up in November 2012. Heteroskedasticity robust estimated standard errors reported in parentheses.
Significance at the one, five and ten percent levels is indicated by ***, ** and *, respectively.

and follow-up. Outcomes obtained from school administrative records include whether the student progressed to the next grade, whether the student needed to
attend summer school before progressing to the next grade (when performance during the academic year was neither good enough to pass the grade nor poor
enough to fail the grade), whether the student failed the grade, and the percentage of subjects in which the student obtained the top mark. Baseline data was

Notes: This table presents evidence on heterogeneous effects. Columns (1) to (4) report estimated adjusted differences and standard errors between
the treatment and control groups from a fully interacted model of both treatments with gender indicators. Columns (5) to (8) report estimated adjusted
differences and standard errors between the treatment and control groups from a fully interacted model of both treatments with baseline academic
achievement indicators. OLS regressions control for class fixed-effects and the baseline value of the outcome (when available). OLS regressions are
restricted to students who comply with the following requirements: (a) participated in the laptop lottery; (b) third to fifth grade at baseline; (c)
answered the specific outcome of interest at baseline and follow-up. The Digital skills, Academic achievement and Cognitive skills indexes are
computed as the average of all standardized scores in the tests belonging to each category restricted to students who completed all examinations
included in each index. Baseline data was collected in April 2011 and follow-up in November 2012. Heteroskedasticity robust estimated standard

Notes: This table presents estimated effects between laptop + internet winners (treatment group), non-winners (control group 1), and laptop only winners
(control group 2) who participated in the laptop lottery and were randomly selected for application of the time diary. Column (1) presents control group 1
means; column (2) presents control group 2 means; column (3) presents treated group means; column (4) presents estimated adjusted differences and standard
errors between the treatment group and control group 1; column (5) presents estimated adjusted differences and standard errors between the treatment group
and control group 2. Estimates in columns (4) and (5) result from OLS regressions with class fixed-effects. Activities such as eating, personal care,
commuting and shopping were also included as part of the time diary, but they are not reported because we neither expected nor observed impacts.
Heteroskedasticity robust estimated standard errors reported in parentheses. Significance at the one, five and ten percent levels is indicated by ***, ** and *,
respectively.

Notes : This table presents statistics and estimated differences between laptop + internet winners (treatment group), non-winners (control group 1), and laptop
only winners (control group 2) who participated in the laptop lottery. Column (1) presents control group 1 means; column (2) presents control group 2 means;
column (3) presents treated group means; column (4) presents estimated adjusted differences and standard errors between the treatment group and control group
1; column (5) presents estimated adjusted differences and standard errors between the treatment group and control group 2. Estimates in columns (4) and (5)
result from OLS regressions with class fixed-effects. OLS regressions include all students who participated in the laptop lottery and were in third to fifth grade at
baseline. Scores in Digital skills, Academic achievement, and Cognitive skills are normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of
non-winners who participated in the laptop lottery. Baseline data was collected in April 2011. Heteroskedasticity robust estimated standard errors reported in
parentheses. Significance at the one, five and ten percent levels is indicated by ***, ** and *, respectively.

Notes: This table presents estimated effects between laptop + internet winners (treatment group), non-winners (control group 1), and laptop only winners
(control group 2) who participated in the laptop lottery. Column (1) presents control group 1 means; column (2) presents control group 2 means; column (3)
presents treated group means; column (4) presents estimated adjusted differences and standard errors between the treatment group and control group 1;
column (5) presents estimated adjusted differences and standard errors between the treatment group and control group 2. Estimates in columns (4) and (5)
result from OLS regressions controlling for class fixed-effects. OLS regressions include all students who participated in the laptop lottery, were in third to fifth
grade at baseline, and answered the specific outcome of interest at follow-up (regardless of whether the student was interviewed at baseline). All scores are
normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of non-winners who participated in the laptop lottery. The Digital skills, Academic
achievement and Cognitive skills indexes are computed as the average of all tests belonging to each category restricted to students who completed all
examinations included in each index. Baseline data was collected in April 2011 and follow-up in November 2012. Heteroskedasticity robust estimated
standard errors reported in parentheses. Significance at the one, five and ten percent levels is indicated by ***, ** and *, respectively.

Notes: This table presents evidence on heterogeneous effects. Columns (1) to (4) report estimated adjusted differences and standard errors between
the treatment and control groups from a fully interacted model of both treatments with baseline computer access indicators. Columns (5) to (8) report
estimated adjusted differences and standard errors between the treatment and control groups from a fully interacted model of both treatments with
baseline home internet access indicators.. OLS regressions control for class fixed-effects and the baseline value of the outcome (when available).
OLS regressions are restricted to students who comply with the following requirements: (a) participated in the laptop lottery; (b) third to fifth grade
at baseline; (c) answered the specific outcome of interest at baseline and follow-up. The Digital skills, Academic achievement and Cognitive skills
indexes are computed as the average of all standardized scores in the tests belonging to each category restricted to students who completed all
examinations included in each index. Baseline data was collected in April 2011 and follow-up in November 2012. Heteroskedasticity robust

Notes: This table presents estimated spillover effects between non-winners with laptop+internet lottery winner friends (treatment group), non-winners without
winner friends (control group 1), and non-winners with laptop only winners (control group 2) who participated in the laptop lottery. Column (1) presents
control group 1 means; column (2) presents control group 2 means; column (3) presents treated group means; column (4) presents estimated adjusted
differences and standard errors between the treatment group and control group 1; column (5) presents estimated adjusted differences and standard errors
between the treatment group and control group 2. Estimates in columns (4) and (5) result from OLS regressions controlling for class fixed-effects and the total
number of friends who participated in the lottery. OLS regressions are restricted to students who comply with the following requirements: (a) participated in the
laptop lottery; (b) third to fifth grade at baseline; (c) answered the specific outcome of interest at baseline and follow-up. Friends are defined using baseline data
on social networks. All scores are normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of non-winners who participated in the laptop
lottery. The Digital skills, Academic achievement and Cognitive skills indexes are computed as the average of all tests belonging to each category restricted to
students who completed all examinations included in each index. Baseline data was collected in April 2011 and follow-up in November 2012.

Notes: This table presents estimated heterogeneous effects regarding laptop utilization between laptop only winners and laptop + internet
winners. Outcomes were obtained from computer logs corresponding to the period July to November 2012 (post-internet period). Columns (1),
(2), (5) and (6) present means for laptop only winners; columns (2), (3), (7) and (8) present estimated coefficients and standard errors on an
indicator for winning the laptop and internet lottery. Estimates in columns (2), (3), (7) and (8) result from OLS regressions with class fixedeffects. OLS regressions are restricted to students who comply with the following requirements: (a) were in third to fifth grade at baseline; (b)
participated in the laptop lottery; (c) won the laptop lottery and received a laptop; and (d) laptop logs were succesfully recovered. Baseline
data was collected in April 2011. Heteroskedasticity robust estimated standard errors reported in parentheses. Significance at the one, five and
ten percent levels is indicated by ***, ** and *, respectively.
