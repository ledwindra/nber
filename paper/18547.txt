Quiet Bubbles

JEL No. G02,G12
ABSTRACT
Commentaries on the credit bubble of 2003-2007 routinely equate it with earlier episodes like the Internet
boom. While credits were over-priced like Internet stocks a decade before, we show, using a model
based on disagreement and short-sales constraints, that this is where the similarity ends. Equity bubbles
are loud: price and volume go together as investors speculate on capital gains from reselling to more
optimistic investors. But this resale option is limited for debt since its upside payoff is bounded. Debt
bubbles then require an optimism bias among investors. But greater optimism leads to less speculative
trading as investors view the debt as safe and having limited upside. Debt bubbles are hence quiet—high
price comes with low volume. We find the predicted price-volume relationship of credits over the
2003-2007 credit boom.

Introduction

Many influential commentators point to a bubble in credit markets from 2003 to 2007,
particularly in the AAA and AA tranches of the subprime mortgage collateralized default
obligations (CDOs), as the culprit behind the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. These commentaries routinely lump together credit and equity bubbles, such as the Internet boom of
the late nineties, as if they were one and the same. For instance, The Economist, in a number
of opinion editorials following the Financial Crisis of 2008, argues for thinking about these
bubble episodes over the past 40 years as the product of too lax monetary policy.1 One
reason perhaps is that the large literature on asset price bubbles often regards bubbles as
being synonymous with price being greater than risk-adjusted fundamental value.2 While
there is indeed compelling evidence that investment-grade or highly-rated credit securities,
especially in housing mortgage-back securities, were severely over-priced (see Coval, Jurek,
and Stafford (2009), Greenwood and Hanson (2011)) in the same way Internet stocks were
a decade earlier, we argue that this is where the similarity ends.
Classic equity bubbles are loud—high prices are accompanied by large trading volume as
investors purchase in anticipation of capital gains (see Hong and Stein (2007) for a review
of this evidence). For example, in the South Sea Bubble of 1720, transactions in the Bank
of England stock, one of the three bubble stocks, were three times larger than in the prior
three years (Carlos, Neal, and Wandschneider (2006)). Stock share turnover during the years
before the Crash of 1929 in the United States were abnormally high by historical standards.
In the dot-com bubble years of the late nineties, internet stocks accounted for nearly twenty
percent of the trading volume in the stock market (Ofek and Richardson (2003)). The
elevated trading volume, and in some of these instances elevated price volatility, associated
with these episodes no doubt prompted the classic economists from Adam Smith to John

Maynard Keynes to emphasize the role of speculation on anticipated capital gains in bubbles.
This signature of equity bubbles is captured parsimoniously in recent asset pricing models
based on investor disagreement and short-sales constraints. The short-sales constraint imparts an upward bias in prices when there is sufficient disagreement among investors (Miller
(1977), Chen, Hong, and Stein (2002)). In a dynamic framework, investors anticipate the
potential to re-sell at a higher price to someone with a higher valuation due to binding
short-sales constraints (Harrison and Kreps (1978), Morris (1996), Scheinkman and Xiong
(2003) and Hong, Scheinkman, and Xiong (2006)).3 This framework generates a bubble or
overpricing in which the asset’s price is above fundamental value. Importantly, the potential
for disagreement tomorrow alone, as opposed to having to assume that all investors are optimistic today, is enough to get prices to be high today since price embeds this resale option.
A distinguishing feature of this model is that the resale option is also associated with high
share turnover, very much in line with anecdotes on classic equity bubbles.
Within this framework, we consider the pricing of a debt security.4 Investors disagree over
the underlying asset value. In the context of the subprime mortgage CDOs, the underlying
asset values are real estate prices. For corporate credits, the underlying asset values are the
assets of the companies. Whereas equity payoffs are linear in the investor beliefs regarding
underlying asset value, debt up-side payoffs are capped at some constant and hence are
concave in the investor beliefs about fundamental.
There is compelling evidence that short-sales constraints are at least as binding in debt
markets as in equity ones. The theory only requires that some (not all) investors be shortsales constrained. Indeed, many mutual funds or insurance companies are required by charter
to be long-only: that is they must simply own investment-grade debt or stocks and are
prohibited by charter from shorting or trading derivatives (such as credit default swaps
3
See Hong and Stein (2007) for a more extensive review of the disagreement approach to the modeling of
bubbles.
4
Earlier work on heterogeneous beliefs and bond pricing such as in Xiong and Yan (2010) assume that
investors have disagreement about bond prices or interest rates and they do not model the nature of the
concavity of debt pay-offs as a function of underlying asset value disagreement.

(CDSs)) (Almazan et al. (2004) and Koski and Pontiff (1999)). A significant portion of
the $28 trillion dollar of mutual fund money is in this long-only format. The short-sales
constraints come not from the cost of shorting but institutional restrictions to shorting.5
Moreover, Asquith et al. (2010) in their study of the cost of shorting corporate bonds point
out that the rise of credit default swaps (CDS) did not influence the shorting activity or cost
of shorting in debt. In other words, CDSs are not a substitute for shorting credit. And in
the case of the mortgage CDOs, short-sales constraints on these CDOs were binding until
the onset of the financial crisis (see Michael Lewis (2010)).
As a result, one might conclude that speculative credit bubbles would come as naturally
in this setting as equity bubbles. But this is far from the case because debt upside payoffs are
bounded in contrast to equity and hence the valuation of debt is less sensitive to disagreement
about underlying asset value. This then limits the speculative resale option of credits.6 As
a result, a debt bubble has to be smaller and than an equity bubble if there is only this
speculative disagreement motive at work. The safer is the debt claim, the more bounded
is the upside, the less sensitive its valuation is to disagreement and therefore the lower the
resale option and the smaller is the bubble.7
In other words, speculative resale alone is not enough to get a credit bubble, particularly
for safe credits like AAA CDOs. Of course, we are not claiming that there cannot be
bubbles in debt. Indeed, there is evidence from Greenwood and Hanson (2011) and Baker,
Greenwood, and Wurgler (2003) that credit cycles in the U.S. over the past eighty years,
including the eighties junk bond wave and the recent credit boom of 2003-2007, are associated
5

There is evidence pointing to the impact of these institutional restrictions on over-pricing in equity
(Chen, Hong, and Stein (2002)). These institutional restrictions to shorting are every bit as relevant for
bonds as they are for stocks.
6
Here we are implicitly comparing a debt claim with an equity claim that does not have limited liability,
so that the only difference between the two claims is the upside of the payoff function. If one compares the
debt claim with the complementary equity claim (i.e. with limited liability), then our results hold provided
that the fundamental of the economy is good enough or that there is enough optimism among investors.
Intuitively, when this is the case, the equity claim is mostly linear in the relevant range while the debt claim
has upside bounded payoffs in the relevant range. The formal analysis of equity with limited liability is in
Section 2.5.
7
We provide a formal characterization that allows the ranking of two assets in terms of their disagreement
sensitivity in Section 2.

with debt bubbles as issuance from poor credit quality firms forecast low future aggregate
bond returns. Optimists told stories of how home prices had been too depressed historically
and would keep rising (see Lereah (2005)) or rationalized the risk of the sub-prime mortgage
CDOs by pointing to the fact that national home prices had never fallen in US history.
Indeed, optimism over a lack of correlation among regional home prices seem to have played
a role in the the credit rating agencies’ models (Coval, Jurek, and Stafford (2009)).
To get debt overpricing, we allow for investor optimism in the disagreement framework.
As investor optimism rises holding fixed fundamental value, debt prices naturally and unsurprisingly rise above fundamental value and a debt bubble emerges. But what is more
interesting is that this optimism channel for debt bubbles makes them quieter in the process. When investors become more optimistic about the underlying fundamental of the
economy, they view debt as being more risk-free with less upside and hence having a smaller
resale option. Hence there is less trading of debt when there is greater investor optimism. In
other words, debt bubbles are inherently quiet whereas equity bubbles are intrinsically loud.
We then provide some evidence for this prediction regarding the relationship between
credit price and volume over the recent credit boom of 2003-2007 by looking at invesmentgrade US corporates.8 There was, of course, huge issuance of credits of all types during
the credit boom of 2003-2007 in the same way that there was a lot of issuance of dot-com
companies during the 1996-2000 (Greenwood and Hanson (2011) and Ofek and Richardson
(2003)). Our focus, however, is on whether the trading of these credits went up during
the 2003-2007 period in the same way that trading in stocks went up during the 1996-2000
period.
Figure 1 from Hong and Stein (2007) plots the monthly share turnover of Internet stocks
and the cumulative returns to owning these stocks and those of the non-internet analogs.
8

There is no comprehensive trading data on the investment-grade mortgage CDOs. But mortgage credits
trade in a similar fashion to US corporates according to anecodotes we gathered from traders at Guggenheim
Partners who trade both types of securities. Institutional investors such as insurance companies value them
for their high credit rating and steady coupons in the same way that they value US corporate bonds. So we
focus on the trading of investment-grade US corporates over the recent credit cycle to test our model.

4

The strong correlation of Internet stock share turnover and valuations can be seen in Figure
1. In Figures 2 and 3, we plot the monthly Bank of America/Merrill Lynch US Corporate
7-10 years Option-Adjusted Spread and trading activity measures (number of trades and
dollar trading volume) of these US corporates by insurance companies. The trading data is
obtained from Schedule D provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC). These figures are the analogs to Figure 1 for dot-com stocks. The lack of a positive
correlation between price and trading activity in credits in contrast to equity is apparent in
Figures 2 and 3. It is also easy to see that trading activity fell over 2003-2007 when spreads
also fell (i.e. when bond prices rose), consistent with the prediction of our model. We make
this point more formally below.
Finally, we want to acknowledge that the quietness of the credit bubble did not mean that
the excesses of the credit boom were not widely heard in other markets. Notably, there was
indeed speculation in housing markets. Homes, especially ones bought with cheap leverage,
have equity-like pay-offs. And consistent with our model, the housing bubble was loud in
that there was speculation in the form of flipping of homes and buying in anticipation of
capital gains. Our only point is that the bubble in credits, whose payoffs depended on these
home values, was quiet.
Our paper proceeds as follows. The model and main results are discussed in Section
2. We discuss empirical evidence Section 3. We conclude in Section 4 by drawing out the
implications of our work for policy and future research. In the Appendix, we collect proofs
and derive an extension of our model to show that even in a setting with an unbiased average
belief, an increase in the dispersion of priors can make bubbles larger and quieter at the same
time, provided that trading costs and asset supply are sufficiently small.

Model

2.1.

Set-up

Our model has three dates t = 0, 1, and 2. There are two assets in the economy. A risk-free
asset offers a risk-free rate each period. A risky debt contract with a face value of D has the
following payoff at time 2 given by:




m̃2 = min D, G̃2 ,

(1)

G̃2 = G + ˜2

(2)

where

and G is a known constant and ˜2 is a random variable drawn from a standard normal
distribution Φ(·). We think of G̃t as the underlying asset value which determines the payoff
of the risky debt or the fundamental of this economy. There is an initial supply Q of this
risky asset.
There are two groups of agents in the economy: group A and group B with a fraction
1/2 each in the population. Both groups share the same belief at date 0 about the value of
the fundamental. More specifically, both types of agents believe at t = 0 that the underlying
asset process is:

Ṽ2 = G + b + ˜2 ,

(3)

where b is the agents’ optimism bias. When b = 0, investor expectations are equal to the
actual mean of the fundamental G and there is no aggregate bias. The larger is b, the greater
the investor optimism.
At t = 1, agents’ beliefs change stochastically: agents in group A believe the asset process

6

is in fact
Ṽ2 = G + b + η A + 2

(4)

while agents in group B believe it is:

Ṽ2 = G + b + η B + ˜2 ,

(5)

where η A and η B are drawn from a normal standard distribution with mean 0 and standard
deviation 1. These revisions of beliefs are the main shocks that determine the price of the
asset, its volatility and turnover at t = 1.
The expected payoff of an agent with belief G + b + η regarding the mean of Ṽ2 for this
standard debt claim is given by:
Z

D−G−b−η

π(η) = E[Ṽ2 |η] =

(G + b + η + ˜2 )φ(˜2 )d˜2 + D (1 − Φ (D − G − b − η)) .

(6)

−∞

If the fundamental shock ˜ is sufficiently low such that the value of the asset underlying the
credit is below its face value (G + b + η + ˜ < D), then the firm defaults on its contract
and investors become residual claimant (they receive G + b + η + ˜). If the fundamental
shock ˜ is sufficiently good such that the value of the fundamental is above the face value of
debt (G + b + η + ˜ ≥ D), then investors are entitled to a fixed payment D. Our analysis
below applies more generally to any (weakly) concave expected payoff function, which would
include equity as well standard debt claims. Note also that the unlimited liability assumption
– the fact that debtholders may receive negative payoff – is not necessary for most of our
analysis, but it allows us to compare our results with the rest of the literature.
Agents are risk-neutral and can borrow from a perfectly competitive credit market.9 The
9

This can be viewed as the limiting case of the following model with borrowing constraints. Agents are
endowed with zero liquid wealth but large illiquid wealth W (which becomes liquid and is perfectly pledgeable
at date 2). Credit markets are imperfectly competitive so that banks charge a positive interest rate, which
we call µ1 − 1, so that µ is the inverse of the gross rate charged by banks. µ is increasing with the efficiency
of the credit market. We consider here the case where µ = 1. The derivation of the model with µ < 1 is
available from the authors upon request. Results are qualitatively similar.

7

discount rate is normalized to 0 without loss of generality. Finally, the last ingredient of this
model is that our risk-neutral investors face quadratic trading costs given by:

c(∆nt ) =

(nt − nt−1 )2
,
2γ

(7)

where nt is the shares held by an agent at time t. The parameter γ captures the severity
of the trading costs – the higher is γ the lower the trading costs. These trading costs allow
us to obtain a well-defined equilibrium in this risk-neutral setting. Note that n−1 = 0 for
all agents, i.e. agents are not endowed with any risky asset. Investors are also short-sales
constrained. This set-up is similar to the CARA-Gaussian platform in Hong, Scheinkman,
and Xiong (2006) except that we consider non-linear payoff functions over disagreement
about underlying asset value.

2.2.

Date-1 equilibrium

Let P1 be the price of the asset at t = 1. At t = 1, consider an investor with belief G + b + η
and date-0 holding n0 . Her optimization problem is given by:


(n1 − n0 )2
max n1 π(η) − (n1 − n0 )P1 +
n1
2γ
J(n0 , η, P1 ) =


(8)

n1 ≥ 0
where the constraint is the short-sales constraint.
Call n?1 (η) the solution to the previous program. If n?1 (η)−n0 is positive, an agent borrows
(n?1 (η) − n0 )P1 +

(n?1 (η)−n0 )2
2γ

to buy additional shares n?1 (η) − n0 . If n?1 (η) − n0 is negative,

the agent makes some profit on the sales but still has to pay the trading cost on the shares
sold (n0 − n?1 (η)). This is because the trading cost is symmetric (buying and selling costs
are similar) and only affects the number of shares one purchases or sells, and not the entire
position (i.e. n1 − n0 vs. n1 ). In equation 8, J(n0 , η, P1 ) is the value function of an agent
with belief G + b + η, initial holding n0 and facing a price P1 . Clearly, J(n0 , η, P1 ) is driven
8

in part by the possibility of the re-sale of the asset bought at t = 0 at a price P1 .
Our first theorem simply describes the date-1 equilibrium. At date 1, three cases arise,
depending on the relative beliefs of agents in group A and B. If agents in group A are
much more optimistic than agents in group B (π(η A ) − π(η B ) >

2Q
),
γ

then the short-sales

constraints binds for agents in group B. Only agents A are long and the price reflects the
asset valuation of agents A (π(η A )) minus a discount that arises from the effective supply of
agents B who are re-selling their date-0 holdings to agents A.
Symmetrically, if agents in group B are much more optimistic than agents in group A
(π(η B ) − π(η A ) >

2Q
),
γ

then the short-sales constraints binds for agents in group A. Only

agents B are long and the price reflects the valuation of agents B for the asset (π(η B )) minus
a discount that arises from the effective supply of agents A who are re-selling their date-0
holdings to agents B.
Finally, the last case arises when the beliefs of both groups are close (i.e |π(η A )−π(η B )| <
2Q
).
γ

In this case, both agents are long at date 1 and the date-1 equilibrium price is simply

an average of both groups’ beliefs ( π(η

A )+π(η B )

2

).

Theorem 1. Date-1 equilibrium.
At date 1, three cases arise.
1. If π(η A ) − π(η B ) >

2Q

γ

only agents in group A are long (i.e. the short-sales constraint

is binding). The date-1 price is then:

P1 = π(η A ) −

both agents are long. The date-1 price is then:

Proof. Let (η A , η B ) be the agents’ beliefs at date 1. Agents in group i are solving the following problem:


and

If this last condition is not verified, two cases may happen. Either agents in group B are short-sales
constrained (nB

P1 = π(η A ) −

This can be an equilibrium if and only if group B agents’ F.O.C. leads to a strictly negative holding or

Date-0 equilibrium

We now turn to the equilibrium structure at date 0. Let P0 be the price of the asset at t = 0.
Then at t = 0, agents of group i ∈ {A, B} have the following optimization program:
 


n20
max − n0 P0 +

n0
2γ

(9)

n0 ≥ 0
where the constraint is the short-sales constraint and the expectation is taken over the belief
shocks (η A , η B ).
The next theorem describes the date-0 equilibrium. In this symmetric setting, it is
particularly simple. Both groups of agents are long and hold initial supply Q. The date-0
demand is driven by the anticipation of the date-1 equilibrium. When agents consider a
large belief shock, they anticipate they will end up short-sales constrained. In this case,
holding n0 shares at date 0 allows the agents to receive n0 P1 at date 1 minus the trading
cost associated with the reselling of the date-0 holding or

n20
.
2γ

Or agents consider a small

belief shock, and thus anticipate to be long at date 1, i.e. that they will not become too
pessimistic relative to the other group. In this case, it is easily shown that their utility from
holding n0 shares at date 0 is proportional to the expected payoff from the asset conditional
on the date 1 belief π(η i ).

Note that the bounds defining the two integrals depend on the aggregate holding of group A, but group

To derive the F.O.C. of group A agents’ program, use the envelope theorem to derive the second integral
w.r.t. n0 . For this integral, the envelope theorem applies as n?1 (x) is determined according to the date-1

Comparative Statics

Now that we have solved for the dynamic equilibrium of this model, we are interested in
how mispricing, share turnover and price volatility depend on the following parameters: the
structure of the credit claim (D), the bias of the agents’ prior (b) and the fundamental of
the economy (G). We will relate the predictions derived from these comparative statics to
the stylized facts gathered in Section 2.
To be more specific, we first define the bubble or mispricing, which we take to be P0 , the
equilibrium price, minus P¯0 , the price of the asset in the absence of short-sales constraints
and with no aggregate bias (b = 0). This benchmark or unconstrained price can be written
as:10
P¯0 =

Z

∞

π(η − b)φ(η)dη −
−∞

Q
.
γ

(11)

Now define Pˆ0 as the date-0 price when there are no short-sales constraint but the aggregate
bias is b. This price is given by

Pˆ0 =

Z

∞

π(η)φ(η)dη −
−∞

Q
.
γ

(12)

10
First, if there is no bias b, then the belief of an agent with belief shock η will be G + η. Thus, this agent
will expect a payoff π(η − b). Moreover, when there is no short-sales constraint, the formula for the price is
similar to equation 10, except that the short-sales constraint region shrinks to 0.

13

The date-0 price can then be decomposed in the following way:

P0 = Pˆ0 +

resale option

In this simple model, the bubble emerges from two sources: (1) there is a resale option due
to binding short-sales constraints in the future and (2) agents are optimistic about the asset
payoff and thus drive its price up.
The second quantity we are interested in is expected share turnover. It is simply defined
as the expectation of the number of shares exchanged at date 1. Formally:



A
T = E{ηA ,ηB } |nA
1 − n0 |

(15)

Share turnover can be expressed in our setting as:




and π(¯(x)(y)) = π(y) +

γ

Intuitively, if y is the interim belief

shock of agents in group A, then when agents in group B have an interim belief shock x
below x(y) (resp. above x̄(y)) agents in group B (resp. agents in group A) are short-sales
constrained. Conditional on one group of agent being short-sales constrained, share turnover
is maximum and equal to Q. When neither group is short-sales constrained, turnover is just
proportional to the difference in valuation between the optimistic and the pessimistic group.

14

The third object is price volatility between t = 0 and t = 1. Price volatility is defined
simply by:


σP = Var{ηA ,ηB } P1 (η A , η B )

(16)

The following proposition shows how these three quantities depend on D.

Proposition 1. A decrease in D (the riskiness of debt) leads to a decrease in (1) mispricing
(2) share turnover and (3) price volatility.
Proof. See Appendix.
Proposition 1 offers a rationale for why debt bubbles are smaller and quieter than equity
ones. The main intuition is that because the credit payoff is bounded by D, it is insensitive
to beliefs on the distribution of payoffs above D. Thus, when D is low, there is very little
scope for disagreement – the credit is almost risk-free and its expected payoff is close to
its face value, and is in particular almost independent of the belief about the fundamental
value. Short-sales constraint are thus not likely to bind (as short-sales constraints at date
1 arise from large differences in belief about the expected payoff). As a result, the resale
option is low (i.e. the asset will most likely trade at its “fair” value at date 1) and mispricing
is low. This, in turns, leads to low expected turnover as turnover is maximized when the
agents’ short-sales constraint binds. Similarly, volatility will be low as prices will be less
extreme (intuitively, the date-1 price will be representative of the average of the two groups
beliefs rather than of the maximum of the two groups’ beliefs). This mechanism builds on
the analysis in Hong, Scheinkman, and Xiong (2006) which relies on risk averse investors and
a positive supply of the security so that there are regions in which both groups of investors
are long.
Conversely, as D increases, agents’ belief matters more for their valuation of the credit,
both because of the recovery value conditional on default and because of the default threshold. In the extreme, when D grows to infinity, the credit becomes like an equity, beliefs

15

become relevant for the entire payoff distribution of the asset and the scope for disagreement
is maximum. This leads to more binding short-sales constraint at date 1, and hence more
volatility and expected turnover.
A simple conclusion emerges from this analysis. For risk-less debt, that is D small, there
is little scope for a bubble in credit to emanate from the resale option component. So it is very
difficult for the speculative resale dynamics, which can easily drive equity bubbles, to create
bubbles in safe credit. Perhaps such a mechanism can work for risky or junk bonds. But the
bonds that were mispriced during the credit boom of 2003-2007 were investment-grade and
in some cases AAA-rated.
For such safe credits, any bubble or mispricing has to emanate from the optimism component due to b—the optimism bias of investors. Indeed, as we discussed in the Introduction,
there is compelling evidence for this explanation. Of course, when the aggregate bias increases (i.e. b increases), mispricing increases in our model. So a first take-away from our
analysis is that the credit bubble had to emanate from the excess optimism of the average
investor as opposed to disagreement or speculative resale among investors.
We can dig a bit deeper and ask what would happen to share turnover and volatility in
our model as we increase b? In other words, high prices are only one symptom of asset price
bubbles. In equity, high trading volume is another. We can see if credit and equity bubbles
differ in these other dimensions as we increase b. That is, is there an auxiliary prediction
associated with the higher prices coming from optimism.
It turns out that turnover and volatility also decrease as we increase b. We prove this in
the following proposition.
Proposition 2. Assume that D < ∞. An increase in aggregate optimism (i.e. b) leads to
(1) higher mispricing (2) lower price turnover, and (3) lower volatility.
Proof. We first look at mispricing. Note that P¯0 is independent of b. Thus:
∂P0
∂mispricing

Formally, the derivative of turnover and price volatility w.r.t. b is equal to the derivative of turnover
and price volatility w.r.t. G. Thus, thanks to the proof of proposition 3 below:
∂T
∂V
< 0 and
<0
∂b
∂b

When investors become more optimistic about the underlying fundamental of the economy, they view debt as being more risk-free with less upside and hence having a smaller
resale option. Hence there is less trading of debt when there is greater investor optimism.
In our model, provided that the payoff function is strictly concave (or equivalently that
D < ∞), an increase in average optimism makes the bubble bigger and quieter at the same
time. This can be contrasted with the case of a straight equity claim, where both volatility
and turnover would be left unaffected by variations in the average optimism – even in the
case of binding short-sales constraint. This is because differences in opinion about an asset
with a linear payoff are invariant to a translation in initial beliefs. Thus while an increase
in optimism would obviously inflate the price of an equity, it would not change its price
volatility nor its turnover. In other words, debt bubbles are inherently quiet whereas equity
bubbles are intrinsically loud.
In Proposition 2, we held fixed G and considered how a change in b influence properties
of the credit bubble. In the next proposition, we hold fix b and consider the comparative
static with respect to G.
Proposition 3. A decrease in G (the riskiness of debt) leads to an increase in (1) mispricing
(2) share turnover, and (3) price volatility.
Proof. See Appendix.
When fundamentals deteriorate, the credit claim becomes riskier and hence disagreement
becomes more important for its valuation. This increase in disagreement sensitivity leads to
an increase in the resale option (the speculative component of the date-0 price increases as
17

short-sales constraints are more likely to bind at date 1) and hence higher mispricing. This
triggers an increase in both price volatility and turnover as argued above and the bubble
stops being quiet.
This prediction is very different from the prediction of the standard model of adverse
selection (e.g., see the discussion by Holmstom (Forthcoming)). In this model, a deterioration
in the fundamental of the economy destroys the information-insensitiveness of the credit,
which reinforces adverse selection and potentially leads to a market breakdown. Thus a
worsening of the economy leads to lower trading activity. In our model, however, when the
economy worsens, agents realize that disagreement matters for the pricing of the credit in
future periods – which drives up the resale option and subsequently increases volatility and
trading volume.

2.5.

Equity with Limited Liability

Our analysis so far has implicitly compared a credit claim (finite D) with an unlevered equity
claim (D = ∞) on the same underlying asset. It is fairly direct to extend our results to the
case where we compare the levered equity claim that complements the credit claim in the
asset value space. Formally, we define the expected payoff function for the levered equity
claim under fundamental G, aggregate optimism b, belief shock η and principal on the debt
claim D as:

E

Z

∞

(G + b + η +  − D) dΦ()

π (η) =
D−G−b−η

The expected payoff of the debt claim is similar to our previous analysis and is easily
defined by: π D (η) = G + b + η − π E (η).
The following proposition compares the loudness of these two tranches:
Proposition 4. There exists Ḡ such that if the fundamental is high enough (G ≥ Ḡ), the
equity tranche has greater mispricing, share turnover and volatility than the debt tranche.

18

Similarly, provided that aggregate optimism is high enough (b ≥ b̄) or that the principal on
the loan is small enough D ≤ D̄, the equity tranche has greater mispricing, share turnover
and volatility than the debt tranche.
Proof. See Appendix.

Intuitively, when G increases, the debt tranche becomes less disagreement sensitive while
the equity tranche becomes more disagreement sensitive. As a consequence, the relative
mispricing of equity vs. debt increases, as well as their relative turnover and volatility. One
purpose of this proposition is to show that provided that b is large, i.e. provided that the
bubble is large enough, our results that credit bubbles are quieter than equity bubbles is
robust to the consideration of shareholders’ limited liability.

2.6.

Characterizing Disagreement Sensitivity

In this section, we move away from the simple debt/equity dichotomy we have emphasized
up to now. Our objective is to provide a characterization of the payoffs of various assets
that allows us to rank them according to their disagreement sensitivity. We consider the
following problem. Take two derivatives on the same underlying fundamental, with payoff
function π1 () and π2 (). To get rid of level effects, we make the assumption that π1 and π2
have the same expected fundamental value, i.e.:11
Z

∞

Z
π1 (x)φ(x)dx =

0

∞

π2 (x)φ(x)dx
0

The next proposition proposes a sufficient condition under which π1 will lead to a larger
and louder bubble than π2 for any distribution of the belief shocks (η A , η B ):
Proposition 5. Assume that for all x ∈ R, π10 (x) ≥ π20 (x) and that the inequality holds
strictly on a non-empty set. Then asset 1 has a strictly larger date-0 price, a strictly larger
11

Note that in our debt setup, an increase in D was increasing both the disagreement sensitivity of the
debt and its expected payoff. In this sense, the exercise we consider in this section is more precise in that
we only consider variations in the slope of the payoff function for a constant expected value.

19

expected turnover and a strictly larger expected volatility than asset 2.
Proof. Consider the function ∆(x) = π1 (x) − π2 (x). Thanks to our assumption on π1 and π2 , ∆ is increasing
over R. We thus have:

∀ y ≥ x, ∆(y) ≥ ∆(x) ⇔ π1 (y) − π1 (x) −

) ≥
γ
γ

Thus, this proves that P0 (π1 ) ≥ P0 (π2 ). This is because (1) short sales constraint are binding more often
under π1 than π2 and (2) when short-sales constraints are binding, the difference between the actual price
and the no-short sales constraint price (which is proportional to the difference in beliefs between the two
groups) is larger under π1 than under π2 . Note that the inequality will be strict as soon as the derivatives
of π1 is strictly greater than the derivative of π2 on a non-empty set of R.
Similarly, it is direct to show that turnover and volatility will be greater under π1 than under π2 . For
instance, short-sales constraints bind more often with π1 and turnover is then maximum and equal to Q.
Moreover, when short-sales constraint do not bind, turnover is proportional to the difference in belief between
the optimistic and the pessimistic group and we know that this difference will be larger under π1 than under
π2 .

Intuitively, the payoff function with the largest slope will be such that differences in
beliefs lead to larger differences in valuation for the asset. It will thus have the largest
probability that short-sales constraints are binding and hence will have the largest price,
expected turnover and expected volatility. Note that because of the constant expected value

20

assumption, the condition in Proposition 5 is similar to a single crossing condition.12
Finally, note that to derive a necessary condition to rank the two assets, one needs to
make assumptions on the p.d.f. of the beliefs shocks (η1 , η2 ). In particular, if the condition
has to hold for any distribution of the belief shocks, then the condition in Proposition 5 is
also a necessary condition.

Price-Volume Relationship of Credits from 19982009

In this section, we provide evidence on the inverse relationship between the price and trading volume of credits over the recent credit cycle from 1998-2009. Our credit spread data
is obtained from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. We use the monthly Bank of America/Merrill Lynch US Corporate 7-10 years Option-Adjusted Spread (OASs). The Bank of
America/Merrill Lynch OASs are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index
of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. The US Corporate 7-10
Year OAS is a subset of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch US Corporate Master OAS,
BAMLC0A0CM. This subset includes all securities with a remaining term to maturity of
greater than or equal to 7 years and less than 10 years.
Our data source for bond trading volume is Schedule D provided by NAIC. Schedule
D covers all the insurance companies in the US, including life and property insurance, and
provides year-end holding and every trading record for bonds, stocks, mutual funds, private
equity and short-term investments for each insurer. The sample includes 1097 life insurance
companies and 2616 property ones or 3713 insurers in total. For the graphs here, we keep
only corporate bond trades. We calculate two measures of bond trading activity. The first
is number of trades by these insurance companies. The second is the dollar trading volume.
12

We have limx→−∞ ∆(x) ≤ 0. If this was not the case, then ∆(x) would be strictly positive for all x and
the two assets could not have the same expected value. Similarly, limx→−∞ ∆(x) ≥ 0.

21

These data are also monthly series. The latter data is comprehensive when it comes to the
trades of insurance companies, which are the major owners of US corporates.
We plot in Figure 2(a) the monthly time series of the credit spread and the number of
trades. Notice that the credit spreads are falling from the end of 2002 to the middle of 2007,
when the financial crisis begins. It can also be easily seen that the number of trades are
falling as the credit spreads are falling or prices are rising, consistent with our model. Notice
moreover that from 1998 to 2002, credit spreads are rising and so is trading activity. We
plot in Figure 2(b) the monthly series of the credit spread and the bond trading volume. We
get a similar picture.
In Table 1, we conduct a regression of the bond spreads on either the log of the number of
trades or of log trading volume. For the whole period, the coefficient is 0.1 but is statistically
insignificant. We then break down the regression into sub-periods of 1998-2001 before the
credit boom, the 2003-2007S1 years (S1 is the first six-months) of the credit boom, up to the
start of the financial crisis in mid-2007, and the period of the financial crisis from 2007S2
to 2009. It is easy to see that there is a very strong correlation between spreads and log
number of trades during the period of the credit boom. The coefficient of interest is 0.99,
which attracts a t-statistic of 4. One standard deviation of our left-hand side variable, credit
spreads, is 1.06. One standard deviation of our right-hand side variable, log number of trades
is 0.323. So for the 2002-2007S1 period, a one standard deviation increase in number of trades
(in logs) is associated with a 30% of a standard deviation increase in spreads, which is an
economically meaningful fraction. The same holds true when we use dollar trading volume.
The coefficient of interest is 0.73 with a t-statistic of 3.1 One standard deviation of log dollar
trading volume is 0.283. So the economic significance is smaller compared to log number of
trades but still sizeable. Notice that the same results holds for the 1998-2001 period.
The only period where the results are not significant is the 2007S2-2009 period of the
financial crisis when credit spreads jumped but trading volume actually fell. Much of this is
due to liquidity issues in credit markets. This liquidity dry-up has been prominently covered

22

in other research. The interesting juxtaposition is that in 2003-2007 when there were no
liquidity issues and the credit boom was taking place, trading in credits actually fell.

4.

Conclusion

In this paper, we attempt to understand the dynamics of equity and credit bubbles within a
unified framework built on investor disagreement and short-sales constraints. Our analysis
is motivated by the observation that the classic speculative episodes such as the dot-com
bubble usually come with high price, high price volatility and high turnover, while the
recent credit bubble appears much quieter. We show that credit bubbles are quieter than
equity ones because the up-side concavity of debt payoffs means debt instruments (especially
higher rated ones) are less disagreement-sensitive than lower rated credit or equity. As a
consequence, optimism which increases the size of credit and equity bubbles makes credit
bubbles quiet but leaves the loudness of equity bubbles unchanged.
Our analysis drawing out the distinction that credit bubbles are quiet in contrast to equity
bubbles adds to, or more accurately amplifies, a laundry list of potential rationales for the
financial crisis, such as agency problems in banking, incentive problems of rating agencies,
excess surplus of savings from China and a lack of price transparency in the mortgage credits
until it was too late. The fact that credit bubbles are quiet might mean that it was difficult
for banks and regulators to see or detect the speculative excesses in contrast to equities. It
is interesting to ask whether this quietness might have contributed to why the crash of the
credit bubble had more severe consequences than for the crash of the dot-com bubble?
Our analysis also suggests the potential usefulness of a taxonomy of bubbles. Here we
offer a first attempt at a taxonomy of bubbles that distinguishes between loud equity bubbles
and quiet credit bubbles. Future work elaborating on this taxonomy and providing other
historical evidence would be very valuable.

Thus, as D increases, both the resale option and the mispricing due to aggregate optimism increases, so
that overall mispricing increases.
We now turn to expected turnover. To save on notations, call x̄(y) the unique real number such that:
2Q
π(x̄(y)) = π(y) + 2Q
γ . Similarly, call x(y) the unique real number such that: π(x(y)) = π(y) − γ . Obviously,

x(y) < y < x̄(y). Expected turnover is:

A.2.

Proof of Proposition 4

Consider first mispricing. The formula for the derivative of mispricing w.r.t. D (equation 17) holds irrespective of the nature of the claim, i.e. whether π = π E or π = π D . We simply remark that π E , as π D , is increasing with x (the investor’s belief) and
And similarly:

∂π E (y)−π E (y−b)
∂D

∂π E (y)−π E (x)
∂D

= Φ(D − G − b − y) − Φ(D − G − b − x) = − ∂π

= Φ(D − G − b − y) − Φ(D − G − y) = − ∂π

D

(y)−π D (y−b)
.
∂D

D

(y)−π D (x)
.
∂D

Thus:

∂(mispricing on π D )
∂(mispricing on π E )
=−
<0
∂D
∂D
Thus mispricing of the equity tranche decreases with D. The difference between the mispricing on the
equity claim and the mispricing on the debt claim decreases with D as well. When D goes to infinity, there
is no mispricing on the equity claim (which is worth 0) so that the difference between the mispricing on the
equity claim and the mispricing on the debt claim is strictly negative. Similarly, when D goes to −∞, there
is no mispricing on the debt claim (which is worth 0) so that the difference between the mispricing and the
equity claim on the mispricing on the debt claim is strictly positive. Thus, there exists a unique D̄1 ∈ R
such that for D ≥ D̄1 , there is a larger mispricing on the equity claim than on the debt claim.
Consider now turnover. The formula for the derivative of turnover w.r.t. D (equation 18) holds irrespective of the nature of the claim, i.e. whether π = π E or π = π D . We simply remark that π E , as π D , is increasing with x (the investor’s belief) and

∂π E (y)−π E (x)
∂D

= Φ(D − G − b − y) − Φ(D − G − b − x) = − ∂π

30

D

(y)−π D (x)
.
∂D

Thus:
∂T(π E )
∂T(π D )
=−
<0
∂D
∂D
Thus, the turnover of the equity tranche decreases with D. The difference between the turnover on the
equity claim and the turnover on the debt claim decreases with D as well. When D goes to infinity, there
is no turnover on the equity claim (which is worth 0) so that the difference between the turnover on the
equity claim and the turnover on the debt claim is strictly negative. Similarly, when D goes to −∞, there is
no turnover on the debt claim (which is worth 0) so that the difference between the turnover on the equity
claim and the turnover on the debt claim is strictly positive. Thus, there exists a unique D̄2 ∈ R such that
for D ≥ D̄2 , there is a larger mispricing on the equity claim than on the debt claim.
That the variance of P1E (x̃, ỹ) is decreasing with D is direct from

∂π E
∂D (x)

D

= − ∂π
∂D (x). Thus, we can

apply the same argument as for mispricing and turnover and show the existence of a unique D̄3 ∈ R such
that for D ≥ D̄3 , the variance of the equity tranche is larger than the variance of the debt tranche. To finish
the proof, simply define D̄ = max(D̄1 , D̄2 , D̄3 ).
The proof for the existence of Ḡ and b̄ follows exactly the same logic.

A.3.

Extension: Interim Payoffs and Dispersed Priors

As we showed in the previous section, an increase in aggregate optimism leads to both larger and quieter
bubbles while leaving unchanged the loudness of equity bubbles. In this section, we highlight another
mechanism that makes credit bubbles both larger and quieter while still holding aggregate optimism fixed.
In order to do so, we add two additional ingredients to our initial model. First, we introduce heterogenous
priors. Group A agents start at date 0 with prior G + b + σ and group B agents start with prior G + b − σ.
Second, we introduce an interim payoff π(G + 1 ) that agents receive at date-1 from holding the asset at date
0. As a consequence, agents now hold the asset both for the utility they directly derive from it (consumption)
and for the perspective of being able to resell it to more optimistic agents in the future (speculation). More
precisely, the t = 1 interim cash-flow π(G + 1 ) occurs before the two groups of agents draw their date-1
beliefs. We also assume that the proceeds from this interim cash flow, as well as the payment of the date-0
and date-1 transaction costs all occur on the terminal date. This assumption is made purely for tractability
reason so we do not have to keep track of the interim wealth of the investors.
Our next proposition shows that, provided that dispersion is large enough, an increase in the initial
dispersion of belief, σ, leads to an increase in prices and simultaneously to a decrease in share turnover an
price volatility. Thus, quiet bubbles emerge when there is sufficient heterogeneity among investors about the

31

fundamental.

Proposition 6. Provided the cost of trading are large enough/initial supply is low enough, there is σ̄ > 0 so
that for σ ≥ σ̄ only group A agents are long at date 0. For σ ≥ σ̄, an increase in σ leads to (1) an increase
in mispricing and (2) a decrease in trading volume.
Proof. We now consider the case where group A has prior G + b + σ and group B has prior G + b − σ. Thus,
at date 1, beliefs are given by (G + b + σ + η A ) for group A, with η A ∼ Φ() and (F − σ + η B ) for group B,
with η B ∼ Φ(). Agents also receive at date 1 an interim payoff proportional to π() from holding the asset at
date-0. We first start by solving the date-1 equilibrium. At date 1, three cases arise:
1. Both groups are long. Thus demands are:

Thus, there is σ̄ > 0 such that for σ ≥ σ̄, the equilibrium has only group A long at date 0, the price increases
with dispersion and turnover decreases with dispersion. QED.

The intuition for this result is the following. The condition on trading costs/initial supply allow the
optimists to have enough buying power to lead to binding short-sales constraints at date 0. In the benchmark
setting, low trading costs/low supply were associated with a louder credit bubble. But it turns out that
when there is dispersed priors they can lead to large but quiet mispricings.
To see why, first consider the effect of dispersed priors on mispricing. Mispricing (i.e. the spread between
the date-0 price and the no-short-sales constraint/ no bias price) increases with dispersion for two reasons.
First, group A agents’ valuation for the interim payoff increases. This is the familiar Miller (1977) effect in
which the part of price regarding the interim payoff reflects the valuations of the optimists as short-sales
constraints bind when disagreement increases. Second, as dispersion increases, so does the valuation of the
marginal buyers (or the optimists) at date 1 – which leads to an increase in the resale option and hence of
the date-0 price.
As dispersion increases, group A agents – who are more optimistic about the interim payoff than group
B agents – own more and more shares until they hold all the supply at date 0 (which happens for σ > σ̄).14
As σ increases, the probability that group B become the optimistic group at date 1 also becomes smaller. As
a consequence, an increase in dispersion leads to an increase in the probability of the states of nature where
turnover is zero or equivalently where the group A agents hold all the shares at date 0 and 1. So overall
expected turnover decreases.
Price volatility also decreases as σ increases. This is because in these states of nature where only group
A agents are long, the expected payoff becomes more concave as a function of their belief shock, so that the
price volatility conditional on these states decreases. When σ becomes sufficiently large, group A agents are
long most of the time and the asset resembles a risk-free asset and price volatility goes down to zero.

14

Note that this occurs despite the fact that both types share the same valuation for the date-1 resale
option – this is entirely driven by the interim payoff: in a pure resale option setting (i.e. without the interim
payoff), all agents would end up long at date 0 as, in the margin, there would be no disagreement about the
value of the resale option.

This section discusses products in the credit derivatives market other than single-name
and index CDS referencing corporate unsecured bonds. Such products include synthetic
CDOs, CDS on leveraged loans, and CDS on asset-backed securities.

Whereas the new issue market for cash bonds provides a constant source of supply,
leveraged structures known as synthetic CDOs provided a constant source of demand
for credit risk that was often sourced through single-name CDS from 2005 until early
2007. In the synthetic CDO market, dealers typically sold credit risk to the end investor
through one particular tranche. Higher credit-risk tranches, such as equity and
mezzanine structures, had greater leverage. Dealers hedged their short credit-risk
exposure by selling

However, during 2007, losses in subprime mortgages and traditional cash CDOs caused
synthetic CDO volumes to plummet. See Figure 133. Correlation desks’ until-then
persistent demand to sell protection dried up, shrinking the cushion that had prevented
credit default swap spreads from moving wider.
Potentially, should such structures ever unwind en masse, CDS spreads could move
notably wider, particularly at popular seven- and ten-year maturities. For a further
introduction to the structured credit market, please see the Chapter Appendix on page
179.

41 correlation desks (groups responsible for
protection on a large number of Reference Entities in different notionals,
credit risk and banks and broker-dealers) often use lists known as “Bid Wanted in Competition (BWIC).” Each recipient
nsible for entering a bid on trades in which it is interested. Typically, either the best bid wins a particular trade or the
best overall wins the entire list. By contrast, an OWIC is an Offer Wanted in Competition and signals the desire to buy
