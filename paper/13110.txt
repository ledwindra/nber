Removing the Disincentives in Social Security for Long Careers

NBER Working Paper No. 13110
May 2007
JEL No. H5,J2
ABSTRACT
Implicit taxes in Social Security, which measure Social Security contributions net of benefits accrued
as a percentage of earnings, tend to increase over the life cycle. In this paper, we examine the effects
of three potential policy changes on implicit Social Security tax rates: extending the number of years
used in the Social Security formula from 35 to 40; allowing individuals who have worked more than
40 years to be exempt from payroll taxes; and distinguishing between lifetime low-income earners
and high-income earners who work short careers. These three changes can be achieved in a benefitand revenue-neutral manner, and create a pattern of implicit tax rates that are much less distortionary
over the life cycle, eliminating the high implicit tax rates faced by many elderly workers. The effects
of these policies on progressivity and women are also examined.

Introduction

When Social Security was instituted in 1935, the period life expectancy at age 20 for males was
66 and for females 69. Today, 20-year-old males have a period life expectancy of 76 and females, 80.
This increase in life expectancy has been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in health at all
ages. Cutler, Liebman, and Smyth (2005) find that, in terms of mortality, men at age 68 in 2000 have
roughly the same mortality risk as men at age 62 in 1960. Thus, at a same age, men in the year 2000 are
roughly six years younger. In terms of self assessed health status, they find that the difference is even
larger, approximately ten years. Their bottom line is, “Our best guess is that people aged 62 in the
1960s are in equivalent health to people aged 70 or more today.” In related work, Shoven (2004)
suggests that the age of elderly people is more appropriately measured by remaining life expectancy
than by years since birth.
These improvements in life expectancy and health status enable individuals to prolong their
careers and delay retirement. However, the length of retirement has actually grown by more than the
increase in life expectancy at retirement. Figure 1 shows labor force participation rates by age in 1965
and 2003. Both early retirees and median retirees are retiring earlier in 2003 than they were in 1965.
Figure 2 displays labor force participation rates by remaining life expectancy rather than age, and shows
that the average length of retirement for men has increased almost 50 percent since 1965. In 1965, the
average length of retirement for the median male retiree was 13 years. By 2003, it was 19 years.
Roughly half of the additional years were due to improvements in life expectancy and half were due to
earlier retirement.

Individuals may choose to use increases in their life expectancy for additional leisure or
additional consumption, and it is possible that the shift towards longer retirements is optimal. However,
there are a number of features of Social Security that distort incentives towards increased retirement
length by imposing high implicit tax rates on longer careers and working at older ages. For example,
Social Security benefits are computed based on the average of an individual’s highest 35 years of
earnings. An individual with fewer than 35 years of earnings has a relatively strong incentive to work
for an additional year as the additional earnings clearly raise the average upon which the benefit is
based. On the other hand, an individual who has already worked for 35 years has a diminished incentive
to work an additional year – the earnings from that year will, at best, replace one of the previous highest35 in the benefit computation. Thus, the benefit formula encourages careers of 35 years or less. Several
other features of the benefit computation – which we will discuss in detail below – contribute to the
disincentives for long careers.
In this paper, we examine the disincentives for long careers created by Social Security. Our
main finding is that the structure of these programs imposes high implicit tax rates on workers late in
their careers. As a result of this distortion, we believe retirements are suboptimally long. The
consequences of this distortion are significant: a lot of the stress on public and private pension systems
is caused by the increased length of retirement. We also outline ways to reduce or eliminate the implicit
taxes on long careers and working at older ages. The potential benefits of a larger work force for Social
Security and Medicare (and GDP) are large.

II.

Work Incentives in U.S. Social Security

In this section, we investigate the impact of Old Age and Survivors’ Insurance (OASI) on the careerlength incentives of both stylized and actual workers. In each year of their working life, we compute the
workers’ present value of Social Security taxes minus benefits under the assumption that they stop
working after the current year (i.e., they accumulate no further earnings). The implicit Social Security
tax rate is defined as the increase in the net tax burden from working an additional year as a percentage
of the current year’s earnings. In other words, this is the additional net tax the worker incurs by
prolonging his or her career by one year. This variable captures the worker’s incentive to continue
working for an additional year as opposed to retiring. Throughout our analysis, OASI benefits are
computed under 2005 law. That is, we sum each worker’s highest 35 years of wage-indexed earnings
that fall below the earnings cap, and divide this amount by 420 months to get the worker’s average

4

indexed monthly earnings (AIME). We then compute the worker’s primary insurance amount (PIA): the
PIA is equal to 90 percent of the first $x of AIME, plus 32 percent of the amount between $x and $y,
plus 15 percent of the remainder of AIME, where x and y are the constructed bend points for the
appropriate retirement year.1 The worker receives the PIA – indexed for inflation – every month from
retirement until death. A minimum of 10 years of work is required to qualify for any benefits. In
computing taxes and benefits, we assume an aggregate wage growth rate of 3.5 percent, an inflation rate
of 2.5 percent, and a discount rate of 4.5 percent. The OASI tax rate is assumed to be 10.6 percent
applied to capped earnings using the historical earnings caps. Benefit streams are discounted for
mortality using the Social Security Administration’s intermediate scenario mortality rates.
Our analysis is similar to that of Feldstein and Samwick (1992). Feldstein and Samwick compute
marginal net tax rates for stylized workers who vary by gender, income, and marital status. They show
that the additional tax paid on an additional dollar of income varies significantly across workers, and
over a worker’s lifetime – in particular, marginal tax rates are significantly higher for single workers,
and for younger workers. Their finding that marginal tax rates decline with age comes from the fact that
as a worker approaches retirement, the present value of the additional benefit received increases.
However, they only compute marginal tax rates for workers between ages 25 and 60, and each year of
earnings over this 35-year period is assumed to count in the benefit computation. This assumption
overlooks a major disincentive for long careers: after a worker has accumulated 35 years of earnings,
additional years are likely to have little, if any, impact on benefits. As we will show below, taking
account of this fact implies that older workers face significantly higher implicit tax rates than younger
workers.
A. A Stylized Computation
To illustrate our argument, we compute implicit tax rates for a set of four male stylized workers
under current law. Three of our stylized workers receive simulated earnings profiles equal to either the
average, 10th percentile, or 90th percentile earnings for his age group. In order to simulate wage
histories, we use Outgoing Rotation Groups from the 2001 and 2002 Current Population Survey to
compute the wage for each of the three earnings levels within each age group. We then divide this by
the aggregate average wage across all age groups. This ratio is multiplied by the historical average wage
in each year of the worker’s life to arrive at a wage for the worker. For example, consider an average

1

The 2005 bendpoints ($627 and $3779) were multiplied by the appropriate wage adjustment factor to be in line with the
year in which the worker retires.

5

male 30-year-old worker in 1950. The national average annual wage in 1950 was $2,763. According to
our computations, a 30-year-old male earns 1.13 times the national average; therefore, his simulated
wage would be $2,763 x 1.13 = $3,122. A fourth stylized worker earns the historical earnings cap in
each year.
We assume that all stylized workers start work at age 20 and retire at the normal retirement age.
The implicit Social Security tax rate for a given career length is calculated as described previously. The
results of this exercise are shown at the top of Figure 3 and labeled “Current Law.” Note that for less
than 10 years of work, the worker is not yet vested in the system and therefore faces an implicit tax rate
of the full 10.6 percent. (These years are not shown in Figure 3.)

Figure 3

Two points should be clear from the graph. First, all workers experience a sharp increase in their
implicit tax rate at 35 years of work. The reason for this increase is that Social Security benefits are
calculated based on the highest 35 years of indexed annual earnings. This means that the 33rd, 34th, and
35th year of work noticeably improve retirement benefits because the earnings of that year replace a zero
in the calculation of average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). On the other hand, the 36th year of
work may or may not enter the calculation, and if it does it will replace a lower year of earnings and not
a zero in the calculation. The marginal incentive to work for the 36th year and beyond is much lower
than for the first 35 years. Part-time work after a career of 35 years or more will, in particular, usually
have no impact on subsequent benefits and therefore the 10.6 percent OASI payroll tax is simply a tax

6

and has no component of deferred benefits. For people who enter the workforce immediately after high
school and who do not leave the labor force for an extended period, 35 years of earnings will be
accumulated by the age of 53.
Second, the median and low earners each experience a sharp increase in their implicit tax rate
earlier in their careers – for the middle-income earner, after 12 years of work and for the low-income
earner, after 22 years of work. This increase results from the fact that the primary insurance amount
(PIA) formula is sharply progressive, combined with the fact that the AIME calculation does not
distinguish between workers with lower earnings and those with higher earners but shorter covered
careers. At the beginning of their careers, workers tend to have a low AIME because they have
significantly fewer than 35 years of positive earnings. The benefit computation replaces the missing
years of earnings with zeros, and these workers appear to be in a lower income group than their true
lifetime earnings would imply. The progressivity of the PIA formula translates this low AIME into a
disproportionately high monthly benefit. As workers accumulate positive earnings years, the benefit
computation begins to treat them as if they have higher lifetime incomes. A sharp increase in the
implicit tax rate occurs when a worker accumulates enough positive earnings years to cross a PIA bend
point. Thus, the current formula favors workers with short careers by treating them as if they were low
earners. In some cases, for instance where the short career was necessitated by poor health, that may be
appropriate. In most cases, however, the current treatment seems inappropriate and blunts the incentive
to work long careers. This effect is most pronounced for low-income workers, who face the sharpest
increase in their implicit tax rate.
These distortions lead us to evaluate the following three reforms:
1. Use 40 years, rather than 35, in the AIME computation.
If 40 years were used instead of 35, this would remove some of the discouragement currently built into
the system for staying in the workforce. An extra five years of work would count towards the
calculation of retirement benefits.
2. Disentangle career length and progressivity.
Average indexed monthly earnings could be calculated only for the months with covered earnings
(eliminating the zeros from the computation and dividing by the number of months of nonzero earnings
rather than 420). The primary insurance amount would be calculated using this modified AIME
formula. However, a single person would only get the full PIA at the NRA if they worked a full career
(currently 35 years, proposed to be 40 years under the first reform). If they worked fewer years, their

7

benefits would be reduced proportionately. For example, consider how we currently treat someone with
a ten-year high-income career. Their benefits are determined as if they were a relative low earner with
the 25 years of zeros in the earnings calculation. The alternative would be to give them 10/35ths of the
PIA of a high earner. This would result in a reduction of benefits for short career workers. This reform
is illustrated in Figure 4 below.

3. Establish a “paid-up” category of workers who have more than 40 years of contributions.
Under the first proposed reform, the number of years in the benefit calculation is 40. A complementary
policy is to only collect 40 years of payroll taxes from workers. After 40 years of covered employment,
the worker would be declared “paid-up” for both Social Security. This should be relatively easy to
administer – conceivably an indicator would be added to the individuals Social Security number
reflecting the fact that paid-up status had been achieved. A related idea was mentioned in Burtless and
Quinn (2002), namely allowing workers who reach the Normal Retirement Age to opt out of additional
Social Security contributions.
There is a theoretical justification for these policies. The intuition of optimal tax theory would
be to place heavier taxes on more inelastic supply (and demand) and lighter taxes or no taxes on highly
elastic behavior. Our hypothesis is that the 41st and 42nd years of work, for instance, are far more
sensitive to incentives than the 21st and 22nd years of work. The practical significance of these three
8

reforms is to make employment of veteran workers more attractive for both the employee and the
employer.
Taken together, these three proposals result in a benefit cut. In order to compensate for this and
keep the reforms benefit-neutral in aggregate, we increase retirement benefits proportionately in order to
keep aggregate benefits constant before and after the reforms. Assuming no behavioral changes, the
adjustment needed is a 19.4 percent increase in benefits. The proposals also result in redistribution from
those with shorter careers to those with longer ones. Figure 5 illustrates this by depicting our stylized
average earner’s PIA, as a function of career length, under both the current and the proposed law. Under
the proposed law, a worker’s PIA would rise more sharply as he or she accumulated years of work – that
is, benefits are more responsive to a decision to delay retirement. Workers with fewer than 31 years of
covered earnings would receive a smaller PIA than under the current system; however, as their career
length extends beyond 31 years, their PIA rises above the current level. A similar result holds for the
low and high earners.

On the revenue side, introducing the “paid-up” category of workers who have worked 40 years
constitutes a reduction in the amount of tax revenues the system receives. We estimate that at most
4.35% of OASI revenue comes from income that was earned after an individual worked 40 years.2
Thus, instituting the “paid-up” reform would require a payroll tax increase of 0.5%, changing the current
OASI tax from 10.6% to 11.1%. All future calculations of the impact of the three proposed reforms
account for the tax and benefit adjustments to ensure benefit- and revenue-neutrality.
We repeat our implicit tax rate computations for the four stylized workers under the proposed
reforms. The results are shown in Figure 6 and labeled “Proposed Law.” Current Law results are also
shown for comparison purposes. Note that implicit tax rates remain roughly constant over each
worker’s life, resulting in less distortion of career length choices. Moreover, implicit tax rates for all
income groups are closer to zero. The decreasing trend arises from the present value of future benefits
increasing as a worker gets closer to the normal retirement age. At 40 years of work, all workers enter
the “paid-up” category and no longer participate in the system.

Figure 6

The estimate of the fraction of OASI revenue earned in years 41+ comes from the Social Security Benefits and Earnings
Public-Use File, 2004 described in more detail in the following section. The beneficiaries’ earnings were indexed to 2003
using the historical Social Security average wage index. This estimate is biased upwards because the dataset only includes
earnings below the taxable maximum, which has increased significantly over the period 1951-2003. This implies the
program has expanded over this time period, and earnings in the earlier part of this period are underrepresented.

10

The proposed reforms do not effect the overall progressivity of the Social Security
system as is shown in Table 1. At the 35-year career length, the average income earner’s
internal rates of return (IRRs) are constant before and after the reforms at 1.17%. The
three policies do not change the relative position of the low and high income earners.
After an individual has worked 35 years, he or she is always better off under the proposed
reforms.

B. Data and Results
The drawback of using stylized workers is, of course, that they do not reflect the
diversity of actual workers’ labor market experiences. In particular, the stylized workers’
ages and career lengths are perfectly correlated. This makes it difficult to capture the
experience of, for example, a woman who takes time out of the labor force to raise
children. Thus, we repeat our computations using the Social Security Benefits and
Earnings Public-Use File, 2004 which contains benefit and earnings data on a 1 percent
random, representative sample entitled to receive a Social Security benefit in December
2004. The full sample contains data on 473,366 beneficiaries. Unfortunately, this data
set provides no way to link couples; therefore, we include only workers who are
receiving benefits based on their own earnings records. We limit our attention to
beneficiaries receiving retirement benefits who started working in 1951 or later3 which
leaves 123,552 individuals born between 1910 and 1942. We continue to use Social
Security intermediate scenario assumptions for mortality.
For the actual worker computations under the proposed law, we introduce an
earnings threshold: years in which earnings are less than 5 percent of the earnings cap are

3

Only aggregate earnings are recorded for years 1937-1950.

not counted toward the years of work calculation, but are subject to payroll taxes.4 The
rationale for the earnings threshold is that many individuals – particularly as they get
older – have years in which they work a small number of hours. Without an earnings
threshold, these individuals’ benefits would increase disproportionately (given the
modified AIME computation and the progressivity of the PIA formula), and they would
accumulate years of credit towards the paid up status. The result is that many older
individuals in the sample would face large negative implicit tax rates. The earnings
threshold reduces this distortion. Of course, this means that years where earnings were
under the threshold face the full tax, unless the individual had attained ‘paid-up’ status by
working more than 40 years. On balance, however, we find that distortions are
significantly less with the earnings threshold. (This issue did not arise with the stylized
workers as our simulated earnings profiles never fell below the 5 percent threshold.)
In order to illustrate the complexity of patterns that actual individuals face, we
plot histograms of the ages at which individuals attain 10 years of covered earnings
(vesting age at which individuals become eligible for benefits), 35 years of covered
earnings (the current number used in the benefit computation), and 40 years of covered
earnings (the proposed number to be used in the benefit computation). The results are
broken down by gender and appear as Figures 7-9.

4

This is not unlike the earnings needed to obtain a quarter of coverage in the current system, $920 in 2005.
To receive 4 quarters of coverage, an individual would need $3,680 in earnings, approximately 4% of the
2005 earnings cap of $90,000. Earnings below this level are subject to the payroll tax even though benefits
are not increased.

While workers tend to reach 10 years of work at age 30, 35 years at age 55, and
40 years at age 60 (like our stylized workers), there is considerable individual variation,
particularly for females. A sizeable number of females reach these experience levels
considerably later than assumed in our stylized example. These figures illustrate the
importance of using actual workers to study the career length incentives created by the
system, particularly if we are interested in the impact on women.
Figures 10 and 11 show our calculations of the average implicit tax rate broken
down by career length (Figure 10), age (Figure 11), and gender. The current law
computations exhibit the same features as did those for stylized workers. Workers face
increases in their implicit tax rates under current law as they age and increase their career
length. This is a result of moving from one PIA bend point to the next, and from
accumulating 35 years of earnings. This result occurs for both male and female workers,
and it is present whether we look at means or medians (not shown).

Under the proposed law, male workers’ implicit tax rates move closer to zero for
all age and experience groups. There is also a much smaller association between implicit
tax rate and age. Most of the large, positive implicit tax rates – which occur late in their
careers – are eliminated. Those that remain are faced by individuals who earn less than
the earnings threshold and therefore are being subject to the full OASI tax rate of 10.6
percent. Individuals with earnings below the threshold drive up the average implicit tax
rates faced under the proposed reforms at older ages; however, the average annual
income earned by people who face the full OASI tax rate is only $1,115. One of the main
differences between the treatment under the current law and the proposed law is the sharp
decrease in the number of people and the amount of income facing the full tax rate under
the three reforms.
The changes redistribute from short-careered workers to long-careered workers as
shown in Figure 12. Individuals who work more than 40 years and are thus subject to the
“paid-up” policy reform no longer see earlier earnings years being replaced by later,
potentially higher earning years. While this could lead to a decrease in their calculated
PIA, the IRR would be higher under the proposed reforms since the added benefit from
replacing a year of earnings in the current calculation is small relative to the amount of
taxes paid.

Females tend to experience a larger subsidy under both current law and the
proposed policies due to the fact that the system is progressive and females in the sample
have lower earnings, and also because their mortality probabilities are more favorable,
making the expected future additional benefits larger. We define the Gender Gap to be
the difference between average male and female implicit Social Security tax rates. Table
2 summarizes calculations of the Gender Gap under different mortality assumptions, and
shows that approximately 40% of the difference between male and female implicit tax
rates is due to more favorable female mortality; the remaining is attributed to differences
in underlying earnings levels.

The reforms may disproportionately penalize women, who are more likely to take
time out of the labor force for child and/or elderly care and experience shorter careers.
Benefit levels are 0.89 percent higher for males but 1.45 percent lower for females under
the three reforms. One possible policy to alleviate this effect would be to give women an
across-the-board credit for working of one, two, or three years. This policy is similar to
the treatment of individuals who take time out of the labor force to raise children in
countries such as Germany. In the German system, a child-raising parent is treated as
though he or she earned the average wage until the child’s third birthday. The differences
between the PIA in the current system and the PIA under the proposed reforms along

17

with a credit for women are given in Table 3. Note that offering a credit to women of
even one year has a substantial effect on the level of benefits.

Our calculations of mean implicit tax rates mask a considerable amount of
variation across workers. To illustrate this variation, we plot individual implicit tax rates
as a function of age for a small subsample of individuals under both current law and the
proposed reforms. These are shown in Figures 13 (current law) and 14 (proposed law).
Most individuals experience features similar to the stylized workers: under current law,
there are sharp increases in implicit tax rate as they cross PIA bend points and another
sharp increase when they accumulate 35 years of work. There is considerable variation
across workers in the timing of these increases. The proposed law eliminates most of the
large positive tax rates for older workers. It also reduces the association between age and
tax rate, and moves tax rates closer to zero for most workers in most years of their lives.
However, many of the workers experience single years with large negative implicit tax
rates. These are years in which earnings are low – these years disproportionately increase
PIA (due to the progressivity of the formula) and contribute towards “paid up” status.

Conclusion

The U.S. labor market has proved to be very flexible in absorbing new workers as
evidenced by its ability to accommodate large numbers of workers as women entered the
labor force in the past several decades, and the economy has benefited greatly as a result
of the larger work force. By eliminating the disincentives against working longer careers,
we can capitalize on the good fortunes of increasing life expectancy and favorable health
status by paving the way for more capable individuals to stay in the labor force.
