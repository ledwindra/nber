The Reliability of Subjective Well-Being Measures

ABSTRACT
This paper studies the test-retest reliability of a standard self-reported life satisfaction measure and
of affect measures collected from a diary method. The sample consists of 229 women who were interviewed
on Thursdays, two weeks apart, in Spring 2005. The correlation of net affect (i.e., duration-weighted
positive feelings less negative feelings) measured two weeks apart is 0.64, which is slightly higher
than the correlation of life satisfaction (r=0.59). Correlations between income, net affect and life satisfaction
are presented, and adjusted for attenuation bias due to measurement error. Life satisfaction is found
to correlate much more strongly with income than does net affect. Components of affect that are more
person-specific are found to have a higher test-retest reliability than components of affect that are more
specific to the particular situation. While reliability figures for subjective well-being measures are
lower than those typically found for education, income and many other microeconomic variables, they
are probably sufficiently high to support much of the research that is currently being undertaken on
subjective well-being, particularly in studies where group means are compared (e.g., across activities
or demographic groups).

Reliability of SWB Measures – 2

Introduction
Economists are increasingly analyzing data on subjective well-being. Since 2000, 157
papers and numerous books have been published in the economics literature using data on life
satisfaction or subjective well-being, according to a search of Econ Lit. 1 Here we analyze the
test-retest reliability of two measures of subjective well-being: a standard life satisfaction
question and affective experience measures derived from the Day Reconstruction Method
(DRM). Although economists have longstanding reservations about the feasibility of
interpersonal comparisons of utility that we can only partially address here, another question
concerns the reliability of such measurements for the same set of individuals over time. Overall
life satisfaction should not change very much from week to week. Likewise, individuals who
have similar routines from week to week should experience similar feelings over time. How
persistent are individuals’ responses to subjective well-being questions? To anticipate our main
findings, both measures of subjective well-being (life satisfaction and affective experience)
display a serial correlation of about 0.60 when assessed two weeks apart, which is lower than the
reliability ratios typically found for education, income and many other common micro economic
variables (Bound, Brown, and Mathiowetz, 2001 and Angrist and Krueger, 1999), but high
enough to support much of the research that has been undertaken on subjective well-being.
The life satisfaction question that we examine is virtually identical to that used in the
World Values Survey, and similar to that used in many other surveys. The DRM is a recent
development in the measurement of the affective experience of daily life. The gold standard for
such measurements is the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) (also called Ecological
Momentary Assessment (EMA)), in which participants are prompted at irregular intervals to

1

Reliability of SWB Measures – 3
record their current circumstances and feelings (Csikszentmihalyi & Larsen, 1987; Stone,
Shiffman & DeVries, 1999). This method of measuring affect minimizes the role of memory
and interpretation, but it is expensive and difficult to implement in large samples. Consequently,
we use the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM), in which participants are required to think about
the preceding day, break it up into episodes, and describe each episode by selecting from several
menus (Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz, & Stone, 2004). The DRM involves memory,
but it is designed to increase the accuracy of emotional recall by inducing retrieval of the
specifics of successive episodes (Robinson & Clore, 2002; Belli, 1998). Evidence that the two
methods can be expected to yield similar results was presented earlier for subpopulation averages
(Kahneman, et al., 2004). A critical advantage of the DRM is that it provides data on time-use –
a valuable source of information in its own right, which has rarely been combined with the study
of subjective well-being.
In this paper we examine reliability measures for a sample of 229 women who each filled
out a DRM questionnaire for two Wednesdays, two weeks apart in 2005. We compare these
reliabilities to those of global well-being measures more typical in the literature, and we
decompose the reliability of duration-weighted net affect into a component due to the similarity
of activities across days and other factors. We also use these reliability estimates to correct
observed relationships between reported well-being and other variables (e.g., income) for
attenuation. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of measurement error for DRM
studies and for well-being research more generally.

Reliability of SWB Measures – 4
What is reliability and why should we care?
Consider an observed variable, y, which is a noisy measure of the variable of interest, y*.
We can write y i = y i* + ei where yi is the observed value for individual i, y i* is the “correct”
value, and ei is the error term. Under the “classical measurement error” assumptions, ei is a
white noise disturbance that is uncorrelated with y i* and homoskedastic. Classical measurement
error will lead correlations between y and other variables to be attenuated toward 0 in large
samples. 2 If we can measure yi at two points in time, and if the measurement errors are
independent and have a constant variance over time, then the correlation between the two
measures provides an estimate of the ratio of the variance in the signal to the total variance in y.
We thus define the reliability ratio, r, as r = corr ( y i1 , y i2 ) , where the superscripts indicate the
measurement taken in periods 1 and 2. Under the assumptions stated, plim r =

var(y*)
.
var (y*) + var(e)

In addition to summarizing the extent of random noise in subjective well-being reports,
the signal-to-total variance ratio is of interest because, in the limit, it equals the proportional bias
that arises when SWB is an explanatory variable in a bivariate regression. Furthermore, as we
explain below, correlations between SWB and other variables are attenuated by random
measurement error in SWB. An important application of SWB data involves estimating the
correlation between life satisfaction, affect and other variables such as income (e.g., Argyle,
1999). We can use the reliability ratio to correct those correlations for attenuation.
Of course, if the measurement error is not classical, the test-retest correlation can underor over-state the signal-to-total variance ratio, depending on the nature of the deviation from
classical measurement error. With only two reports of y, and without knowledge of y*, it is not
2

If y is of limited range (e.g., a binary variable) than e will necessarily be correlated with y*. We ignore this issue
for the time being.

Reliability of SWB Measures – 5
possible to assess the plausibility of the classical measurement error assumptions. If the errors in
measurement are positively correlated over time, then the test-retest correlation will overstate the
reliability of the data. Nevertheless, the test-retest correlation is a convenient starting point for
assessing the reliability of subjective well-being data.

Related literature
There is a vast empirical literature on subjective well being (Kahneman, Diener and
Schwarz, 1999). Subjective well-being is most commonly measured by asking people a single
question, such as, “All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these
days?” or “Taken all together, would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too
happy?” Such questions elicit a global evaluation of one’s life. Surveys in many countries
conducted over decades indicate that, on average, reported global judgments of life satisfaction
or happiness have not changed much over the last four decades, in spite of large increases in real
income per capita. Although reported life satisfaction and household income are positively
correlated in a cross section of people at a given time, increases in income have been found to
have mainly a transitory effect on individuals’ reported life satisfaction (Easterlin, 1995).
Moreover, the correlation between income and subjective wellbeing is notably weaker when a
measure of experienced happiness is used instead of life satisfaction (Kahneman et al., 2006). Of
course, such low correlations could be partially due to attenuation, if measurement error is high.
There is a small literature assessing the reliability of individual-level single-item wellbeing measures, even less on the reliability of ESM, and none as of yet on the DRM (see Table
1). Single-item measures of SWB have been found to have relatively low reliabilities, usually
between .40 and .66, even when asked twice in the same session one hour apart (Andrews and

Reliability of SWB Measures – 6
Whithey, 1976). Kammann and Flett (1983) found that single-item well-being questions under
the instructions to consider “the past few weeks” or “these days” had reliabilities of .50 to .55
when asked within the same day. Interestingly, the only study we are aware of that looked at the
reliability of an ESM measure of duration-weighted happiness found a correlation on the upper
end of the range found for single-item global well-being measures (Steptoe, Wardle and Marmot,
2005). Overall, there has been surprisingly little attention paid to reliability, despite the wide use
of these measures.
The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS, Diener et al., 1985) is another commonly used
global satisfaction measure. In contrast to the single question measures it consists of the average
of five related items, each of which is rated on a 7-point scale from Strongly Disagree (1) to
Strongly Agree (7). The items are: “In most ways my life is close to my ideal”; “The conditions
of my life are excellent”; “I am satisfied with my life”; “So far I have gotten the important things
I want in life”; and “If I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing”. A key reason
that SWLS has proven more reliable than single item questions (see Table 1), is that since it is
the sum of multiple items, it benefits from error reduction through aggregation. Eid and Diener
(2004) used a structural model to estimate reliability for a sample of 249 students, measured
three times with four weeks between successive measurements. After statistically separating out
the influence of situation specific factors, they estimated that the imputed stability for life
satisfaction was very high, around 0.90.

*Note: From Pavot and Diener (1993), Table 2

One reason for the modest reliability of subjective well-being measures compared with
education and income, which typically have reliability ratios of around 0.90, could be the
susceptibility of SWB questions to transient mood effects. For example, researchers have
documented mood changes due to such subtle events as finding a dime before filling out a
questionnaire, the current weather, or question order, which in turn influence reported life
satisfaction (e.g., Schwarz, 1987). Eid and Diener (2004) used a structural model to attempted to
separate situational variability from random error and basic stability, they found that anywhere
from 4% to 25% of the variance in various affect and satisfaction measures were accounted for
by situation-specific factors. In an earlier study, Ferring et al. (1996) estimated this the size of
this influence as between 12% and 34% of the total variance. Since the experienced affect
measure produced by the DRM is focused on reconstructing a specific event and the affect

Reliability of SWB Measures – 8
experienced during it, there is at least the possibility that such measures will be less
vulnerable to current mood at the time of the interview.
We might expect DRM measures to be less reliable over time than life satisfaction
because a person’s activities change from day to day. At the same time, DRM measures are
averages of multiple responses, while global life satisfaction of happiness is often assessed with
just one question. If ESM is any guide, the DRM may be at least as reliable as reported overall
life satisfaction.

Method
We evaluate the test-retest reliability of the DRM by having the same respondents
complete a DRM questionnaire two weeks apart regarding the same day of the week
(Wednesday). The questionnaire, which is available from the authors on request, also contained
standard global life satisfaction measures. The resulting data provide information about the
relative stability of the DRM compared to the types of global life satisfaction questions used in
most well being research for the same sample.
For comparability with our previous studies, the respondents (n = 229) were selected by
random selection of women from the driver’s license list in Travis County, Texas and screening
for employment and age between 18 and 60. Respondents were paid $50 upon completing the
first questionnaire and an additional $100 upon completing the second one for a total of $150.
The interview dates were two Thursdays, March 31, 2005 and April 14, 2005. Following the
DRM procedure, participants reported on the previous day. Completion times for the selfadministered instrument ranged from 45 to 75 min. The ethnic composition of the sample was

Reliability of SWB Measures – 9
67% white (non-Hispanic), 7% African American, 21% Hispanic, and 5% other. Average age
was 42.8 years. Median household income category was $40,000-$50,000.
The DRM protocol described by Kahneman et al. (2004) was followed. Groups of
participants were invited to a central location for a session on Thursday evening, where they
answered a series of questions contained in four packets. The first packet included general
satisfaction and demographic questions. Next, the respondents were asked to construct a diary of
the previous day (Wednesday) as a series of episodes, noting the content and the beginning and
end time of each. In the third packet, they were asked for a detailed description of every episode
as explained below. The average number of episodes a respondent described for the day was
somewhat higher in the second session (14.8 vs 13.2, p < .001, by a paired t-test) although the
total time covered by the episodes was no different (16.8 vs 16.7 hrs, p > .20, by a paired t-test).
These figures compare to the 14.1 episodes and 15.4 hours reported in Kahneman et al. (2004).
The first few questions in the survey were global SWB questions. First was the overall
life satisfaction question, “Taking all things together, how satisfied are you with your life as a
whole these days? Are you very satisfied, satisfied, not very satisfied, not at all satisfied?”
Next, similar questions were asked for “your life at home” and “your present job”. Two global
mood questions followed, for home and for work. The question posed was ‘‘When you are at
home, what percentage of the time are you in a bad mood____%, a little low or irritable____%,
in a mildly pleasant mood____%, in a very good mood____%." The last two response categories
were added together to obtain the percentage of time in a good mood. Net mood was computed
by subtracting the sum of the first two response categories from the sum of the last two. The
same procedure was applied to the work mood question.

Reliability of SWB Measures – 10
The affect measures derived from the DRM are combinations of the duration-weighted
affective adjectives that respondents rated for each episode. Net affect was computed by
subtracting the average of negative affect (NA) – tense/stressed, depressed/blue and angry/hostile
from the average of positive affect (PA) – happy, affectionate/friendly and calm/relaxed. 3
Difmax is the duration-weighted average of happy less the maximum of tense/stressed,
depressed/blue, angry/hostile. The U-index is closely related to Difmax, and equals one when
Difmax < 0 and = 0 otherwise. Intuitively, the U-index is an binary variable indicating the
proportion of time that an individual spends in a state in which the strongest emotion is a
negative one. Difmax and the U-index are recently proposed summary measures of affective
experience (Kahneman & Krueger, 2006; Kahneman, Schkade, Krueger, Fischler & Krilla,
2006).

Results
Table 2 presents the correlations between various measures for the same person in the
first and second sessions, as well as 95% confidence intervals. We focus first on overall
measures of affective experience. Perhaps the most surprising finding is that the reliabilities of
Net Affect (r=.64) and Difmax (r=.60) are at least as high as that for life satisfaction (r=.59).
Satisfaction with domains of life (work and home) are both more reliable than satisfaction with
life overall. The corresponding home and work mood measures are also more reliable than life
satisfaction. Another notable feature of the results is that positive affect appears to be somewhat
more reliable than negative affect.

The extent to which a person’s rating of a particular adjective over different episodes of
the day represents personal traits or is influenced by the variability in situations is likely related
to the reliability of that adjective. If a given person tends to feel the same way most of the time
(a “happy” person or a “depressed” person) regardless of the situation, then this adjective might
be expected to have greater reliability across the two sessions, since the activities the person
engages in on the two days vary. To crudely gauge the extent to which particular adjectives are
person-bound or situation-bound, for each adjective we pooled the two sessions and computed
the variance of the duration-weighted personal averages across people and the average variance
within each person’s days across episodes, and then took the ratio of the between people to
within-person variances. A high ratio would indicate that an adjective is relatively constant for a
person (more of an individual difference like a trait) and a low ratio would indicate that an
adjective is determined more by the situation than who the person is. Results are shown in Table
3. Quite plausibly, feeling depressed appears to be a more trait-like descriptor, while feeling
tense/stressed or impatient for an episode to end are highly situational. Interestingly, we found a
correlation of 0.41 between the variance ratio and the reliability ratios shown in Table 3, which
indicates moderate support for the hypothesis of greater reliability for trait-like emotions. 4

We also computed these ratios for the DRM sample in Kahneman et al (2004). The two samples produced very
similar sets of ratios – for the 8 adjectives in common between the two samples the correlation of the ratios was .89.

Affective Similarity of Time Allocation
We next examine the affective similarity of how individuals spent their time on the
survey reference dates. We can decompose the reliability ratio into a component that reflects the
hedonic similarity of activities in the survey reference days and all other factors. Let Aij1 denote
Net Affect for person i during her activity in episode j in week 1, and Aij2 net affect for person i
during the activity in episode j in week 2. Using hij to denote the fraction of the day devoted to
episode j, we write average net affect over the course of the day in week 1 and week 2 as yi1 and
yi2 , respectively, defined as y i1 = ∑ j hij1 A1j and yi2 = ∑ j hij2 A2j . The reliability of average net

affect in successive interviews, which we have emphasized so far, is measured by

ρ = cov(yi1 , yi2 ) / σ y σ y . The reliability ratio reflects the accuracy of reporting of the data and the
1

2

Reliability of SWB Measures – 14
persistence of average net affect over time. The affective experience data could be accurately
reported, but if people engage in activities that yield very different affective experiences from
week to week, the correlation will nonetheless be low.
To ascertain the proportion of the reliability ratio that results from engaging in activities

that yield similar affective experiences over time, we define yi1 = ∑ j hij1 Aj , where Aj is the
average affect taken over all people while they are engaged in activity j. Analogously, we define
∧

∧

yi2 = ∑ j hij2 A j for the follow-up interview. Notice that yi1 and yi2 are predicted average net
affect based entirely on an individual’s time allocation and the sample’s overall rating of activity
j. An individuals’ affective rating does not enter in these predictions (except through the sample
mean). A straightforward measure of the similarity of activities on the reference days is the

Prediction of Aj

The results indicate that individuals would have a correlation of around 0.30 in their net
affect on the reference dates if they used the sample-wide average net affect to rate their
activities. Because activities and interaction partners only account for around 10 percent of the
∧

∧

variation in net affect at the episode level, however, the variance of yi1 and of yi2 is considerably
lower than the variance of y i1 and of y i2 . Consequently, the share of the covariance or variance
of reported net affect that is accounted for by time use is quite small, on the order of around 1
percent. When we look at specific affects we reach a similar conclusion. For example, time use
accounts for only 2 percent of the estimated signal in tense/stress. Thus, the relatively high
reliability of the DRM data across two weeks comes about mainly because of individual
differences in affect, irrespective of the situations that people find themselves in on the reference
days.

Adjusting Correlations for Attenuation
One consequence of less than complete reliability is that observed correlation between
two measured variables x and y are attenuated in proportion to the degree of error. Assuming
classical measurement error, the asymptotic equation relating the observed correlation to the
“true” correlation is (Nunnally, 1978):
rxy = ρ xy rxx ryy

where
rxy = observed correlation between x and y

ρxy = true correlation between x and y
rxx = reliability of x
ryy = reliability of y

The correction for attenuation uses this relation to produce an asymptotically unbiased
estimate of the “true” correlation by rearranging to solve for ρxy we have:

ρ xy =

rxy
rxx ryy

Since for nondegenerate distributions the denominator is in the interval (0,1), adjusted
corrected correlations are higher than the observed correlations ( ρ̂ xy > rxy). Attenuation
corrections are somewhat controversial because they are only asymptotically unbiased and
because the degree of attenuation may vary across data sets. Thus, if the assumptions of
classical measurement error are satisfied, the magnitude of the adjusted correlation is best taken
as a rule of thumb estimate for the true correlation.

Reliability of SWB Measures – 17
Using the asymptotic formula as an approximation, we can examine the effect that
measurement error might have on observed relationships. Table 5 shows some examples.
Perhaps most importantly, the first row shows that the correlation between life satisfaction and
net affect rises to .50 when we adjust for measurement error in both variables. Although this is a
substantial increase, the resulting correlation nonetheless indicates that daily net affect and life
satisfaction are distinct descriptors of individuals’ lives.

Testing for Heteroskedastic Errors
Although with only two temporal observations we cannot directly test the assumptions of
classical measurement error, we can investigate whether discrepancies in Net Affect over time
are homoskedastic errors. Specifically, we regress net affect at period 2 on the same measure at
period 1 and test for homoskedastic errors. With classical measurement error ei is assumed to

Reliability of SWB Measures – 18
have the same distribution for all i. To examine this property we use the method of Kroenker
and Bassett (1982), which employs quantile regressions. Figure 1 shows a scatter diagram of
net affect at periods 1 and 2, with 20th and 80th quantile regression lines. There is only a
marginally significant difference between the 20th and 80th quantile regression lines (t = -1.70, p
= .09), which indicates that there is possibly some evidence of heteroskedasticity. However,
adjacent comparisons yield mixed results – if we instead use the 40th and 60th or 30th and 70th
quantile pairings the test is not significant, but with the 25th and 75th or the 10th and 90th pairings
the test is significant (p <.05). Using a different test for homoskedastic errors due to White
(1980), we regress net affect at period 2 on period 1, and then regress the resulting squared
residuals on period 1 net affect; n*R2 from this second regression ~ χ2. The resulting R2 is .004
and χ2(1) =.916, ns, from which we cannot reject the hypothesis of homoskedastic errors. It is
possible that the assumption of homoskedastic measurement error could be violated, but the
deviation is probably slight.

Reliability of Aggregate Activity Experience Ratings
The reliabilities we have computed thus far are defined at the level of the individual. For
many applications, however, the key issue is not the reliability of net affect for individuals, but
rather the reliability of average net affect across individuals engaged in various activities. The
question of reliability in this context is whether a given activity produces the same average
_

experience at different times. A simple test for this is to compute the mean values Aj for each
activity for each time period and correlate the vectors across activities. Table 6 presents the mean
net affect for each day by activity and interaction partner. The two DRMs produce a remarkably
similar patterns of mean net affect across activities (r = .96, see Table 6 and Figure 2) and also of
relative frequency (r = .99, see third and sixth columns of Table 6).

Discussion
We analyzed the persistence of various subjective well-being questions over a two-week
period. We found that both overall life satisfaction measures and affective experience measures
derived from the DRM exhibited test-retest correlations in the range of .50-.70. While these
figures are lower than the reliability ratios typically found for education, income and many other
common micro economic variables, they are probably sufficiently high to support much of the
research that is currently being undertaken on subjective well-being, particularly in cases where
group means are being compared (e.g. rich vs poor, employed vs unemployed) and the benefits
of statistical aggregation apply.
It is perhaps surprising that measures intended to assess the general state of SWB over an
extended period (such as overall life satisfaction) should be no more reliable than measures of
affective experience on different days two weeks apart. One’s general level of life satisfaction
would be expected to change only very slowly over time, because so do most of its known
correlates (age, income, marital status, employment). A key factor behind this result is probably
the fact that answering a life satisfaction question explicitly invokes a nonsystematic review of
one’s life, which leaves such measures vulnerable to transient influences that draw attention to
arbitrary or incomplete information (e.g. one’s immediate mood, the weather). By contrast,
measures of affective experience from experience sampling or the DRM do not rely on such
cognitive appraisals, and have the benefit of aggregating over several episodes and adjectives,
They also have the disadvantage, however, that no two days (even if intentionally matched, as in
our study) are truly the same.

Reliability of SWB Measures – 24
Another application of reliability estimates is to assist in the determination of appropriate
sample sizes for the measurement of various emotional experiences. In clinical trials, for
example, if SWB measures are one of the outcome variables of interest, reliabilities can be used
to help determine the sample size needed to detect an expected difference between groups.
Because the reliabilities are modest, the risk of incorrectly concluding that groups do not differ is
of particular concern. As we saw in our examples of correction for attenuation, the true strength
of relationships could easily be underestimated in the small samples that clinical research must
sometimes employ (e.g. with special populations). An alternate design approach to larger
samples of course would be reduce error by sampling the same people at different points in time.
