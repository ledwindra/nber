Conditional on receiving pensions, the value of pension benefits varies because white males have the highest level of expected tenure atretirement. By using a combination of the Current Population Survey and the 1980 Banker's Trust Corpprate Pension Plan Study, we find that the existence of pension plans contributes to black/white inequality but leaves male/female inequality unchanged among whites. Even though females are less likely tor eceive pensions than males, those females who do receive pensions enjoy generous ones.  Among blacks, pensions exacerbate sex differences because black women are only about 75% as likely to receive pensions as black males.\n\n",
