Skilled unemployment is due to rational waiting by workers looking for long-term jobs when there is a \"lock-in\" effect. Lock-in occurs if the conditions in the labor market when a worker first accepts a job have a persistent effect on wages. Using longitudinal data, we provide empirical evidence of the cyclical pattern of wages predicted by the theory and also of lock-in.\n\n",
