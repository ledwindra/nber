    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the problem of learning about the effect of one market-level variable (e.g., price) on another (e.g., quantity) in the presence of shocks to unobservables (e.g., preferences). We show that economic intuitions about the plausible size of the shocks can be informative about the parameter of interest. We illustrate with a main application to the grain market.\n\n",
