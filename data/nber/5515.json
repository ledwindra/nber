    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper describes data on U.S. imports from 1972-1994, classified according to the Tariff Schedule of the U.S. Annotated (TSUSA), Harmonized System (HS), Standard International Trade Classification (SITC, Revisions 2 and 3), and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC, 1972 basis), along with various concordances. All of these data sets are disaggregated by the source country for imports.  These data are available on the CD-ROM: `NBER Trade Database, Disk 1: U.S. Imports, 1972-1994,' which can be ordered for $50 from the Publications Department, NBER, 1050 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02138.  The TSUSA and HS import data are at the most disaggregate level collected by the U.S. Census, and will be particularly useful for research on antidumping cases.  The SITC import data will be valuable for those wanting to compare U.S. trade flows at a more aggregate level with comparable data for other countries.  The SIC import data will be particularly useful for those wanting to study the effects of import competition on U.S. industries. A summary of the SIC data, which does not contain the source country detail and incorporates earlier years, is available via anonymous FTP from: nber.harvard.edu/pub/feenstra.  A second CD-ROM, containing U.S. export data, will be released later in 1996.\n\n",
