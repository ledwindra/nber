Productivity and Pay: Is the link broken?
Anna M. Stansbury and Lawrence H. Summers
NBER Working Paper No. 24165
December 2017
JEL No. E24,J24,J3
ABSTRACT
Since 1973 median compensation has diverged starkly from average labor productivity. Since
2000, average compensation has also begun to diverge from labor productivity. These
divergences lead to the question: to what extent does productivity growth translate into
compensation growth for typical American workers? We investigate this, regressing median,
average and production/nonsupervisory compensation growth on productivity growth in various
specifications. We find substantial evidence of linkage between productivity and compensation:
over 1973-2016, one percentage point higher productivity growth has been associated with 0.7 to
1 percentage points higher median and average compensation growth and with 0.4 to 0.7
percentage points higher production/nonsupervisory compensation growth. These results suggest
that other factors orthogonal to productivity have been acting to suppress typical compensation
even as productivity growth has been acting to raise it. Several theories of the cause of the
productivity-compensation divergence focus on technological progress. These theories have a
testable implication: periods of higher productivity growth should be associated with periods of
faster productivity-pay divergence. We do not find substantial evidence of co-movement between
productivity growth and the labor share or mean/median compensation ratio. This tends not to
provide strong support for pure technology-based theories of the productivity-compensation
divergence.

Introduction
After growing in tandem for nearly 30 years after the second world war, since 1973 an
increasing gap has opened between average labor productivity and the typical American
worker’s compensation: over 1973-2016 median compensation grew by only 11% in real terms,
and production/nonsupervisory workers’ compensation grew by only 12%, compared to a 75%
increase in labor productivity. Since 2000 average compensation has also begun to diverge from
labor productivity. We illustrate these trends in Figure 1, showing the growth since 1948 in labor
productivity, average compensation, and average production/nonsupervisory compensation
(proxying for the “typical” worker) 1.

What does this stark divergence imply for the relationship between productivity and typical
compensation? A range of views are compatible with the data presented in Figure 1.
On one end of the spectrum, it is possible that productivity growth has delinked from
typical compensation, casting doubt on the common aphorism that “a rising tide lifts all boats”.
Factors may be blocking the transmission mechanism from productivity to pay such that
increases in productivity growth do not systematically translate into increases in typical workers’
compensation (we refer to this view as “strong delinkage” going forward).
On the other hand, just as two time series apparently growing in tandem does not mean
that one causes the other, two series diverging may not mean that the causal link between the two
has broken down. Rather, other factors may have come into play which appear to have severed
the connection between productivity and compensation. As such it is possible that productivity
growth translates directly into increases in typical workers’ pay, but even as productivity growth
has been acting to raise pay, other orthogonal factors have been acting to reduce it (we refer to
this view as “strong linkage” going forward).
Between these two ends of the spectrum is a range of possibilities where some degree of
linkage exists between productivity and typical compensation.
A number of authors have questioned where the American economy currently sits on this
linkage-delinkage spectrum. Harold Meyerson for example wrote in American Prospect in 2014
that “for the vast majority of American workers, the link between their productivity and their
compensation no longer exists”. The Economist wrote in 2013 that “unless you are rich, GDP
growth isn't doing much to raise your income anymore.”

3

The productivity-compensation divergence has also led to questions as to the extent to
which faster productivity growth would boost typical incomes. Bernstein (2015) for example
writes that “Faster productivity growth would be great. I’m just not at all sure we can count on it
to lift middle-class incomes.” Bivens and Mishel (2015) write “although boosting productivity
growth is an important long-run goal, this will not lead to broad-based wage gains unless we
pursue policies that reconnect productivity growth and the pay of the vast majority”.
Establishing where the productivity-typical compensation relationship falls on the
linkage-delinkage spectrum is important not only to gain a better understanding of the
mechanisms causing middle income stagnation and the productivity-pay divergence, but also to
design the most effective policy solutions.
We estimate the extent of linkage or delinkage in the productivity-typical compensation
relationship by investigating the co-movement of growth in productivity and typical
compensation, using the natural quasi-experiment provided by the fact that productivity growth
fluctuates through time. Under the strongest linkage view, marginal increases in productivity
growth will translate one-for-one into increases in typical worker compensation even without any
changes to policy. Under the strongest delinkage view, given the current structure of the
economy marginal increases in productivity growth will not translate into increases in typical
workers’ pay2. In between these views is a translation of productivity growth to compensation
growth which is positive but less than one.

2

Finding support for “delinkage” would not necessarily imply that productivity growth can never translate into pay.
It would most likely imply that given the current structure of the economy, the transmission mechanism from
productivity growth to typical pay is blocked – but that with certain reforms this transmission process could be
restored.

4

The majority of debate on the productivity-pay divergence has focused on the divergence
between productivity and typical workers’ pay (median or production/nonsupervisory workers).
Yet it is also possible to define “linkage” and “delinkage” views for the gap between average
compensation and labor productivity, which has grown since about 2000 as the labor share has
started to fall. We investigate the evidence on the linkage-delinkage question for both typical and
average compensation.
We find that periods of faster productivity growth over the last seven decades have in
general coincided with faster real compensation growth for the typical American worker. Since
1973 our regressions suggest that a one percentage point increase in productivity growth has
been associated with between two thirds and one percentage point higher real compensation
growth for the median worker, with almost none of the coefficient estimates statistically
significantly different from one and all significantly different from zero. For average
production/nonsupervisory compensation, a one percentage point increase in productivity growth
has been associated with 0.4-0.7 percentage points higher real compensation growth.
For average compensation, since 1948 and since 1973 our estimates suggest that a one
percentage point increase in productivity growth has been associated with between 0.7 and one
percentage points higher real compensation growth. Coefficients in most specifications are
statistically significantly different zero. Since 2000, the coefficient estimates are slightly lower in
the range of 0.4-0.8 depending on the specification.
Overall, this evidence suggests that the relationship between median compensation and
productivity since 1973 has been very substantial and close to one-for-one even while the two
series have diverged in levels. For production/nonsupervisory compensation, the evidence
suggests that there is substantial linkage between productivity growth and the compensation
5

growth of production/nonsupervisory workers, but that this linkage is likely less than one-forone. Since median compensation and production/nonsupervisory compensation grew by the same
amount in levels the difference in these coefficient estimates is interesting and bears further
investigation. For average compensation, there has been substantial and close to one-for-one
linkage in the relationship with productivity over the postwar period, with an open question as to
whether the degree of that linkage has fallen somewhat since 2000.
Overall we believe that the evidence is supportive of there being substantial linkage
between productivity and typical worker compensation, and between productivity and average
compensation. Rather than the link having broken down, it appears that it is largely factors not
associated with productivity growth that have caused typical and average compensation to
diverge from productivity.
What are these factors causing the divergence between productivity and typical pay? A
large body of research has worked on understanding both the divergence between median and
average pay (a manifestation of rising income inequality) and the divergence between average
pay and productivity (the falling labor share). Explanations include technological progress,
education and skills, globalization, institutions and market power. The technology-focused
theories have a testable implication: under the assumption that more rapid technological progress
causes faster productivity growth, if the primary cause of the productivity-pay divergence is
technological progress then periods of faster productivity growth should coincide with faster
growth in this divergence.
To test this we examine the co-movement of labor productivity with the labor share and
with the mean-median compensation ratio. The general tendency in the data is not strongly
supportive of a pure technology hypothesis for the productivity-pay divergence: we find little
6

evidence of a significant relationship between the rate of productivity growth and changes in the
labor share for any period except the period since 2000, and no evidence of a relationship
between productivity growth and changes in the mean-median ratio.
Our paper proceeds as follows. We first discuss definitions of the productivitycompensation divergence and measurement issues, informed by previous literature on the
subject. We then describe our data and empirical approach, present our baseline results, and
discuss robustness, testing under alternate specifications and considering the effect of
productivity mismeasurement. We next show regressions for different deciles of the US wage
distribution and for other OECD countries. We finally examine the co-movement of productivity
growth with the pay-productivity divergence and its implications for technology-based theories
of the pay-productivity divergence.

Existing work, definitions & measurement
The divergence between median compensation and productivity can be decomposed into various
components, as shown in Figure 2 (which is similar to those in Bivens and Mishel 2015 and
Lawrence 2016)3. Gross labor productivity has grown faster than net labor productivity because
of rising depreciation4; net labor productivity has grown faster than average compensation
deflated by a PPI as the labor share has fallen; average compensation deflated by a producer
price index (PPI) has grown faster than average compensation deflated by a consumer price

3

Pessoa and Van Reenen (2013), Fleck, Glaeser and Sprague (2011), and Baker (2007) have demonstrated similar
divergences.
4
The importance of this fact in the productivity-compensation divergence is discussed in among others Baker
(2007), Sherk (2013), Bivens and Mishel (2015) and Lawrence (2016).

7

index (CPI) as the “terms of trade” between consumer and producer have diverged5; and average
compensation has grown faster than median compensation as income inequality in the top half of
the distribution has risen. In addition, median compensation has grown faster than median wages
as non-wage benefits have grown as a share of total compensation (not shown on the graph).
Figure 2: Productivity-compensation divergence decomposition, total economy, 1973-2016

A number of papers have investigated the degree to which the productivity-pay
divergence has occurred, and there has been debate about the appropriate measures of
compensation and productivity to use. The appropriate measures ultimately depend on the
question being asked.

5

This is analyzed with reference to the productivity-compensation divergence in, among others, Lawrence and
Slaughter (1993), Bosworth and Perry (1994), Feldstein (2008), Sherk (2013) and Lawrence (2016). According to
the BLS this divergence is partly because the CPI uses Laspeyres aggregation and the GDP deflator uses Fisher ideal
aggregation. In addition the CPI includes import prices, and does not include goods and services purchased by
businesses, governments or foreigners (Church 2016). There is extensive work on the divergence between different
deflators including Triplett (1981), Fixler and Jaditz (2002), McCully, Moyer and Stewart (2007), Bosworth (2010).

8

One possible line of inquiry is to study the divergence between productivity and the
typical worker’s compensation. Bivens and Mishel (2015) document this divergence, comparing
net total economy labor productivity with two measures of typical worker compensation: median
compensation and average production/nonsupervisory worker compensation, both deflated by
consumer price deflators. They argue that production/nonsupervisory compensation is both a
good measure of typical compensation in itself, representing trends for about 80% of the private
sector workforce, and is also a good proxy for trends in median compensation before 1973 (a
period for which median compensation data is not available). Baker (2007) and Pessoa and Van
Reenen (2013) have carried out similar analyses, using production/nonsupervisory compensation
and median compensation respectively.
Another line of inquiry is to investigate the divergence between productivity and average
compensation. This is conceptually equivalent to the decline in the labor share6. Feldstein (2008)
compares labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector to average nonfarm business sector
compensation7 as deflated by a producer price deflator over 1948-2006. When investigating
consumers’ experienced rise in living standards as in Bivens and Mishel (2015), a consumer
price deflator is appropriate; however as Feldstein (2008) argues, when investigating factor
income shares a producer price deflator is more appropriate because it reflects the real cost to
firms of employing workers. Bosworth and Perry (1994) and Lawrence and Slaughter (1993)
carried out similar analyses for earlier periods. Lawrence (2016) analyzes this divergence more

6

In the special case of Cobb-Douglas technology, this also tests the marginal productivity theory of labor (whether
workers are paid their marginal product by firms). With non-Cobb-Douglas technologies, a divergence of workers’
wages from their average productivity can occur even while workers are being paid their marginal product.
7

Using compensation rather than wages is important. The share of compensation provided in non-wage benefits
such as health insurance significantly rose over the postwar period, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s,
meaning that comparing productivity against wages alone would imply a larger divergence between productivity and
workers’ pay than has actually occurred.

9

recently, comparing average compensation to net productivity, which is a more accurate
reflection of the increase in income available for distribution to factors of production. Since
depreciation has accelerated over recent decades, using gross productivity creates a misleadingly
large divergence between productivity and compensation. Lawrence finds that net labor
productivity and average compensation grew together until 2001, when they started to diverge
i.e. the labor share started to fall. Many other studies also find a decline in the US labor share of
income since about 2000, though the timing and magnitude is disputed (see for example
Grossman et al 2017, Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014, Lawrence 2015, Elsby Hobijn and Sahin
2013, Rognlie 2015, Pessoa and Van Reenen 2013).
In this paper we are concerned with the divergence of productivity from both typical
compensation and from average compensation. In each case, we want to ask the question: to
what extent does productivity growth feed through into typical/average worker compensation?
We have chosen the measures of compensation and productivity which are most appropriate for
the particular questions we are asking.
For typical compensation, we compare net total economy productivity with median
compensation. While median compensation is our preferred measure for the typical worker, we
also report results for average production/nonsupervisory compensation, both as an interesting
measure in itself and since it enables us to analyze the pre-1973 period (as in Bivens and Mishel
2015). We focus primarily on median compensation since it is the measure which is most clearly
interpretable as showing trends for middle income workers. Median compensation captures
trends for the middle of the income distribution, while average production and nonsupervisory
compensation captures the average trend for production and nonsupervisory employees, who
compose roughly 80% of the private sector workforce. Median compensation is consistently
10

lower than average production/nonsupervisory compensation (for example in 2015 median
hourly compensation was $22.04 and average production/ nonsupervisory compensation was
$26.61). Since the average production/nonsupervisory compensation figure is a mean, it can be
skewed by large changes at the top or bottom of its distribution.
In addition as discussed by Abraham, Spletzer and Stewart (1998) and Champagne,
Kurmann and Stewart (2015), there is some evidence that the average production/nonsupervisory
compensation measure does not cover all workers that it is intended to. They suggest that many
service sector establishments surveyed for the CES (from which production/nonsupervisory
wages are calculated) interpret the “production and non-supervisory” category to include hourlypaid and/or non-exempt workers (under the Fair Labor Practices Act), but to exclude other types
of salaried or exempt worker even if they are non-supervisory. This may represent a significant
group of middle income workers8 which is growing over time (Barkume 2007).
While the two series cover different workers, they move in a similar fashion over most of
1973-2016, with an exception during the 1980s where production/nonsupervisory compensation
falls significantly more than median compensation in real terms. We speculate that this
divergence may have been driven partly by the substantial fall in incomes for the lowest end of
the distribution which would have pulled down the average production/nonsupervisory measure,
and partly by the reduction in well-paid blue-collar jobs (covered in the
production/nonsupervisory measure) and increase in middle-income white-collar jobs (possibly
missed out of the production/nonsupervisory measure).

8

Some examples of occupations where workers are likely to be exempt, salaried, and earn around the median wage:
pre-school teachers, several categories of clerk and administrative assistants, medical and equipment technicians.

11

For average compensation, we look at mean total economy compensation. We deflate
all our compensation series using consumer price deflators to reflect the changes in standards of
living experienced by workers.
We estimate the linkage between productivity and compensation with a regression
approach similar to that in Feldstein (2008). Feldstein investigated the linkage between
productivity and average compensation by regressing the change in log of average compensation
on the current and lagged change in log of productivity, finding a strong and close to one-for-one
relationship. We use a similar approach to investigate the linkage between typical compensation
and productivity, and to update Feldstein’s estimates of the linkage between average
compensation and productivity to include the last decade.

Empirical estimation
At the simplest level, a linear model can relate productivity and typical or average compensation
growth9 as shown in equation (1) below. Under the strongest “linkage” view, β=1, and under the
strongest “delinkage” view, β=0. β between 0 and 1 suggests a point on the linkage-delinkage
spectrum.
(1)
We can estimate β using the substantial variation in productivity and compensation growth rates
since the second world war. We look at three different concepts for compensation: median

9

We use the change in logged values of compensation and productivity, rather than their levels, as compensation
and productivity are both non-stationary unit root processes but their first differences appear to be stationary (as
suggested by Dickey-Fuller tests).

12

compensation, average production/nonsupervisory compensation, and average compensation. For
brevity since we run the same tests for all compensation measures, we refer to them as
“compensation” below.
In our baseline specification (equation 2), we regress the three-year moving average of the
change in log of real compensation on the three-year moving average of the change in log of
labor productivity and the current and lagged three-year moving average of the unemployment
rate10.

(2)
It is not immediately clear over what time horizon any productivity-compensation relationship
would hold most strongly. It will depend on both the wage setting process and on the degree to
which productivity changes are correctly perceived and anticipated. If firms on average change
pay and benefits infrequently, increases in productivity will only translate with a lag into changes
in compensation. If it takes some time for firms and workers to discern the extent to which an
increase in output is due to a rise in productivity rather than other factors, once again
productivity increases will translate into compensation only with a lag. On the other hand, if
firms and workers correctly anticipate that there will be a productivity increase in the near future,
the rise in compensation may precede the actual rise in productivity. As a result of this
uncertainty we also present results for regressions without a moving average, and with two-,

10

To account for the autocorrelation introduced by the moving average specification we use Newey-West
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust standard errors. For our moving average regressions, we specify a lag
length of twice the length of the moving average. For our distributed lag regressions, we specify lag length using the
“rule of thumb” lags =0.75*T1/3 (Stock and Watson 2007).

13

four- and five-year moving averages. We repeat our regressions with a distributed lag
specification with up to four years of lagged productivity and find results similar to those in our
moving average regressions (results available on request).
We control for the level of unemployment for two reasons. First the level of
unemployment itself is likely to affect search and bargaining dynamics: a higher unemployment
rate should enable employers to raise compensation by less than they otherwise would have for a
given productivity growth rate, as more unemployed workers are searching for jobs. In addition,
unemployment is likely to reflect broader cyclical economic fluctuations which may affect
compensation setting in the short term: higher unemployment may signal a downturn, which
could bring lower firm revenues, profits and pay rises for a given rate of productivity growth. If
unemployment is also related to changes in productivity growth – for example, if the least
productive workers are likely to be laid off first – then excluding the unemployment rate would
bias the results. By controlling for the current and one-year lagged moving average of the
unemployment rate we allow for both the level and the change in unemployment to affect
compensation growth. We use the unemployment rate of 25-54 year-olds to avoid capturing
effects of demographic shifts such as an ageing population; using the total unemployment rate
instead has almost no effect on our results.

Data
We primarily use publicly available data from the BLS, BEA and the Economic Policy Institute
State of Working America Data Library, as well as the BLS Total Economy Productivity dataset
which is available on request from the BLS.
Our measure of labor productivity for the total economy is calculated by dividing Net
Domestic Product, deflated by the Net Domestic Product price index, by the total hours worked
14

in the economy, following Bivens and Mishel (2015). Average compensation for the total
economy is from the BLS total economy productivity dataset. Our median and
production/nonsupervisory compensation series are from the Economic Policy Institute State of
Working America Data Library. They construct median wages from the CPS-ORG survey and
average production/nonsupervisory wages from the BLS CES, and deflate these by the CPI-URS. They then adjust to include non-wage compensation using the average real
compensation/wage ratio, which they calculate from BEA NIPA data on the composition of
workers’ compensation, deflating all components of compensation by the PCE except costs for
health and life insurance which are deflated by the PCE health care index (further details are
available in Bivens and Mishel 2015). We are grateful to Larry Mishel and Josh Bivens for
providing us the raw data alongside the publicly available versions.
Our analysis of different percentiles of the wage distribution uses data on real wages from
the Economic Policy Institute State of Working America Data Library. The data is constructed
from the CPS-ORG survey and deflated by the CPI-U-RS. It starts in 1973.
There are some ambiguities with respect to the appropriate choice of compensation and
productivity measures. We choose to deflate our compensation series with the CPI-U-RS over
the PCE because it is designed to deflate only the consumption of individuals/households,
whereas the PCE also includes consumption by non-profits and some purchases of healthcare for
individuals by government or employers. It could be argued however that we should use the PCE
since it is a chained consumer price index and since its data from establishment surveys may be
more reliable (as argued by Lawrence 2016), or that we should use a producer price deflator
since if not our regression will pick up differences in price deflators which may be considered to
be statistical artefacts rather than real divergences. We repeat our baseline regressions with
15

compensation deflated by the PCE and NDP price index and find little change to our results
(available on request).
Productivity is difficult to measure accurately for the entire economy: it comprises
government and non-profit institutions, whose output is difficult to conceptualize and measure
since it is usually not traded on markets. Nonfarm business sector productivity is likely to be
better measured than total economy productivity, but only captures 75 percent of GDP and only
has a gross measure of productivity available. We repeat our baseline regressions with nonfarm
business sector productivity and find little change to our results (available on request).
For our analysis of the other major advanced economies, we only focus on the linkage
between average compensation and productivity since there is not good internationally
comparable data on median hourly compensation. Unless otherwise specified we use OECD data
on labor productivity per hour worked and average compensation per hour worked, deflated by
the consumer price index for the country in question, as well as using OECD data on the
aggregate unemployment rate. For Germany pre- and post-reunification, we use data on hourly
labor productivity, hourly compensation and unemployment from the German Federal Statistical
Office.

Table 1 displays our baseline regression results. The dependent variable is the growth in
average compensation in columns a-d, median compensation in column e and production and
non-supervisory compensation in columns f-h. For average and for production/nonsupervisory
compensation we show coefficients for the whole postwar period as well as on either side of
197311. 1973 is often identified as the beginning of the modern productivity slowdown, as well
as the date when median and production/nonsupervisory compensation began to diverge from
productivity12; breakpoint tests also identify a structural break at 1973 for both average and
production/nonsupervisory compensation13. Since our median compensation data only goes back
to 1973, splitting the sample then also makes it easier to compare the results for
production/nonsupervisory and median compensation. For average compensation we also show a
split from 2000 onwards as this is the period over which average compensation and productivity
began to diverge.
Median compensation: The results in Table 1 suggest that over 1975-2015, the period
during which productivity and median compensation diverged in levels, a 1 percentage point
increase in the growth rate of productivity was associated with a 0.73 percentage point increase
in the growth rate of median compensation. The coefficient is strongly significantly different
from zero and not significantly different from one. This suggests substantial linkage between

11

Note that since we use 3-year moving averages, we break the regressions such that the last data point in the 19501973 regressions is the 3-year moving average of the change in log productivity/compensation for 1972, 1973 and
1974, and the first data point in the 1975-2015 regressions is the 3-year moving average of data for 1974, 1975 and
1976.
12
The Economic Report of the President (2015), Bivens and Mishel (2015), Baker (2007), Bosworth and Perry
(1994) are among the authors who identify a break at 1973 when discussing trends in US productivity and
compensation.

For regressions of the change in log productivity with either average compensation or with
production/nonsupervisory compensation, a Wald test is significant at the 0.1% level for a break at 1973.

productivity and median compensation, and the “strong linkage” hypothesis of a one-for-one
relationship between productivity and compensation cannot be rejected.
Production/nonsupervisory compensation: Over 1975-2015, a 1 percentage point
increase in the growth rate of productivity was associated with a 0.53 percentage point increase
in the growth rate of average production/nonsupervisory compensation. The coefficient is
significantly different from both zero and one. The result suggests substantial positive linkage
between productivity and production/nonsupervisory compensation, but does not support the
“strong linkage” hypothesis of a one-for-one relationship.
Average compensation: Table 1 shows that there has been a strongly positive and
significant association between changes in log productivity and average compensation. Over
1950-2015 and 1975-2015 a one percentage point increase in the growth rate of productivity was
associated with a 0.74 and 0.77 percentage point increase in the growth rate of average
compensation respectively; the estimates are strongly significantly different from zero and not
significantly different from one.
Over 2000-2015 the coefficient estimate is smaller at 0.40; it remains significantly
different from zero but is also significantly different from one. When testing for significant
differences in coefficients between the pre-2000 and post-2000 period, results are mixed: in an
unrestricted regression allowing all coefficients to differ between the two periods we find
significantly different coefficients on productivity at the 5% level, while a regression allowing
the productivity coefficients to differ but restricting unemployment coefficients and the constant
to be the same across the whole 1950-2015 period gives a larger coefficient on productivity over
2000-2015 (0.56 rather than 0.4) and the difference between the two periods is non-significant
(results shown in Appendix Table A11).
19

Overall these results suggest substantial linkage between productivity and average
compensation. The “strong linkage” hypothesis cannot be rejected for most of the period. For the
period since 2000 over which the labor share has declined, there is some suggestion that the
degree of linkage may have fallen (though “strong delinkage” is still rejected).

We do this using average compensation and production/nonsupervisory compensation since 1948
and median compensation since 1973. Table 2 shows a summary of these results for the
coefficient on the change in log productivity. We show the full regressions in Appendix Tables
A1-A714.
In general we find our results relatively robust across different specifications.
The coefficient estimates for median compensation are in the range of 0.65 to 1, are
significantly different from zero at the 1% level and mostly not significantly different from one.
(Cells shaded grey have a coefficient that is significantly different from one at the 5% level).
This suggests substantial linkage between productivity and median compensation, and the
“strong linkage” hypothesis cannot be rejected in almost all of the specifications.
For production/nonsupervisory compensation since 1973, the coefficient estimates are
in the range of 0.4 to 0.7, significantly different from zero at the 1% level and also significantly
different from one. As before this suggests a large degree of linkage between productivity and
production/nonsupervisory compensation, but rejects both the “strong linkage” and “strong
delinkage” hypotheses.
For average compensation since 1973, the coefficient estimates are in the range of 0.70
to 0.91, strongly significantly different from zero and mostly not significantly different from one,
while over 1999-2016 the estimates are between 0.40 and 0.79 and mostly strongly significantly
different from both zero and one. This once again suggests substantial linkage between

We have also repeated the regressions using distributed lags instead of moving averages, using nonfarm business
sector productivity instead of total economy productivity, and deflating the compensation series with the PCE and
NDP price index rather than the CPI-U-RS. The overall picture from these regressions is not substantially different
from those we present here and in the Appendix. These results are available on request.

productivity and average compensation, with some possibility of a reduction in the degree of
linkage since about 2000.
Overall, the evidence is largely supportive of the hypothesis that for middle class
workers, increases in productivity growth feed through substantially to increases in real
compensation growth.

Cells that are significantly different from one at the 5% level are highlighted in grey. All others are not significantly

regressions use 3-year moving averages.

The fact that the coefficients are significantly lower for production/nonsupervisory
compensation than for median compensation bears further investigation. Average compensation
growth trends for production/nonsupervisory workers do not appear to reflect productivity

22

growth to the same extent as compensation for the median worker, in spite of the fact that in
terms of levels, the two series are relatively similar throughout the postwar period15.
Three additional features of these results are worth noting.
First, estimating only the contemporaneous relationship between productivity growth and
compensation (2e), as expected, reduces the magnitude of the estimated coefficient in almost all
regressions: insufficient time may be allowed by this specification for firms to pass productivity
growth through to workers’ compensation.
Second, the coefficient estimates on productivity in the pre-1973 period are not as high as
one might expect for both average compensation and production/nonsupervisory compensation,
considering that productivity and both compensation measures moved largely together in terms
of levels during that period. The coefficient estimates rise significantly as the moving average
bandwidth is extended, suggesting that the responsiveness of compensation to productivity
growth may have been slower in the earlier period. In addition, the period from 1956-1965 was
one of particularly low variation in both compensation and productivity growth which may
magnify the effect of noise; the coefficient estimates rise significantly if that period is excluded
when running the pre-1973 regression (to 0.82 for average and 0.80 for production/
nonsupervisory compensation in the baseline specification).
Third, the coefficient estimates for production/nonsupervisory compensation are higher
for the whole postwar period than for either of the two sub-periods. We prefer to look at the two
periods either side of 1973 separately since there is strong evidence of a structural break in the

23

relationship around 1973, and so the strong relationship over the whole period appears to be a
combination of two separate and somewhat weaker relationships over the two sub-periods.

Productivity mismeasurement?
There has been substantial debate over the extent to which the productivity statistics are
mismeasured (e.g. Feldstein 2017, Groshen et al 2017, Syverson 2017, Byrne, Fernald and
Reinsdorf 2016). Mismeasurement may occur, for example, if technological innovations are
under-measured, or if quality improvements or new goods and services are hard to value.
The degree of mismeasurement in the productivity statistics should not substantially affect
our conclusions. We are comparing real output per hour – labor productivity – to real
compensation per hour. The labor productivity series is constructed by deflating nominal Net
Domestic Product by the NDP price index, and dividing by total hours worked. The NDP price
index is constructed as an aggregate of sector- or product-specific producer and consumer price
indexes from the BLS and BEA. The average real compensation series is constructed by
deflating nominal aggregate compensation by the CPI, and dividing by total hours worked. We
have no reason to believe that there is substantial mismeasurement in the nominal series: output
and compensation. Since both series are divided by the same metric of hours worked, we also
need not be concerned that mismeasurement in hours will affect our conclusions. The only major
causes for concern with mismeasurement are the price deflators. But since we are investigating
the relationship between changes in productivity and changes in real compensation, as long as

24

the relative degree of mismeasurement in the price deflators for output and consumption has not
changed, mismeasurement should not affect our conclusions16.

The rest of the income distribution
Our evidence thus far suggests that median compensation growth, average compensation growth
and production/nonsupervisory compensation growth are all strongly positively related to
productivity growth. What about other parts of the income distribution?
We test the relationship between productivity and wages at each decile of the wage
distribution using data from the Economic Policy Institute’s State of Working America Data
Library, constructed from CPS-ORG microdata. This data estimates hourly wages at each decile
of the distribution rather than total hourly compensation, so is likely to understate compensation
growth as benefits have grown faster than wages for much of the postwar period (as discussed in
e.g. Bosworth and Perry 1994, Feldstein 2008, Bivens and Mishel 2015, Lawrence 2016).
We repeat our baseline three-year moving average regressions of wage growth on
productivity growth for each decile of the wage distribution below in tables 3 and 4. The results
show substantial differences in the co-movement of productivity and wages by decile. The wages
of the workers at the 20th and 40th to 90th percentiles co-move significantly with productivity,
with coefficients between 0.3 and 0.7.

16

This argument is stronger if we deflate the compensation series by the implicit price deflator for output. In that
case, both the compensation and productivity series are deflated by the same price index and so the underlying
relationship between the two should remain in spite of any mismeasurement. We have redone our baseline
regressions deflating compensation by the NDP price index and do not see substantial differences in our results
(available on request).

A significant caveat in interpreting these regressions is that these data are for wages not
for total compensation. Since non-wage compensation grew more quickly than wages for much
of the period we investigate, our wage data underestimates total real compensation growth. It is
probable that the growth in non-wage benefits is positively correlated with both the growth rate
in wages and the growth rate of aggregate productivity. As a result our estimates are likely to be
biased downwards.
Comparing the coefficient estimates in the median wage and median compensation
regressions can help quantify this bias at least for the middle of the distribution. The coefficient
in the regression of the median wage on productivity is 0.60 compared to 0.73 for the regression
of median compensation on productivity, suggesting that the bias is quite large, at about 20% of
the coefficient size.
Since non-wage benefits make up a vastly different share of total compensation for
workers at different points of the wage distribution (demonstrated in Appendix Figure A1), and
these shares have grown differently for different parts of the wage distribution over recent
decades (Pierce 2010, Monaco and Pierce 2015), this bias estimate cannot be extrapolated with
any confidence to the entire wage distribution. Evidence from the BLS does suggest however
that at least over the periods 1987-1997, 1997-2007 and 2007-2014, the ratio of wage to nonwage compensation grew similarly for the middle of the income distribution, between about the
40th and 60th percentiles (Pierce 2010, Monaco and Pierce 2015). We therefore extrapolate the
rough magnitude of the bias at the 50th percentile to suggest that the coefficient estimates from
the wage-productivity regressions at the 40th and 60th percentiles may be similar underestimates
of the compensation-productivity relationship.

27

Other countries
In the cross-section, countries with higher labor productivity tend to have higher typical and
average compensation. Lawrence (2016) finds a close to one-for one correlation between labor
productivity and average manufacturing compensation for 32 countries; and we find a correlation
coefficient of 0.8 between 34 OECD countries’ labor productivity and their median household
equivalized disposable income17.
Though the cross-country relationship between productivity and compensation is strong,
as in the US median compensation has diverged from productivity in most OECD countries over
the last two decades, with common trends of rising mean-median income inequality and a falling
labor share18(Schwellnus, Kappeler and Pionnier 2017, Sharpe and Uggucioni 2017, Nolan,
Roser and Thewissen 2016, International Labor Organization 2015). This suggests the possibility
that in some of these countries there may have been a delinkage of productivity from
compensation.
Studying this delinkage question in detail for other countries as we have done for the US
would be a valuable direction for future research. As an initial exploration we repeat our
regressions for average compensation for the G7 economies, shown in table 5 below. We do not
repeat our regressions for median compensation, since most countries lack comparable median
hourly compensation data over a sufficiently long time series to do this.

17

We use 2007 data from the OECD on labor productivity and household equivalized disposable income. Household
equivalized disposable income takes into account taxes and social security contributions paid by households as well
as the value of government services provided and as such reflects a country’s redistributive policies as well as its
underlying labor market dynamics. We use this measure since there is not a good comparable measure of median
hourly compensation – which would be our preferred measure – across countries. A scatter plot is shown in
Appendix Figure A2.

For comparative international evidence on the labor share decline, see e.g. Cho, Hwang and Schreyer 2017,
Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014, Azmat, Manning and Van Reenen 2011, Blanchard and Giavazzi 2003, Bentolila
and Saint-Paul 2003.

The regressions show a mixed picture. The relationship between average compensation
and productivity in Canada, West Germany (pre-reunification), the UK and the USA appear to
reflect a strong degree of linkage: coefficients on the change in log of productivity are strongly
significant, close to one and not significantly lower than one. Germany post-reunification,
France, Italy and Japan have positive but smaller coefficients.
Taken as a whole, the results certainly support the view that productivity growth has
positive impacts on average compensation, but they do not support the view that the relationship
is necessarily one-to-one. There is to us a surprisingly high degree of variation between different
countries, and we believe further exploration would be valuable.

Technological change and the productivity-compensation divergence
As discussed earlier in the paper, the gap between net labor productivity and median real
compensation can be thought of in terms of three separate divergences (Bivens and Mishel
2015): the divergence between mean compensation and productivity (equivalent to a fall in the
labor share), the divergence between median and mean compensation (one aspect of rising labor
income inequality), and the divergence between consumption and product price deflators.
Several prominent theories focus on technological change to explain the first two of these
three divergences: the falling labor share, and rising labor income inequality in the top half of the
distribution. We first outline some of the major theories behind these divergences, then suggest
that the pure technological change based theories have a testable implication: periods of faster
productivity growth (and by implication faster technological progress) should be associated with
faster growth in each of these divergences.

Falling labor share (productivity/mean compensation divergence):
The growing “wedge” between labor productivity and mean compensation is equivalent to a
falling labor share of income:

A number of theories of this recent labor share decline (productivity/mean compensation
divergence) focus on technological progress. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) argue that the
labor share has fallen in the US and around the world as a result of a fall in the price of
investment goods. This, combined with an elasticity of substitution between labor and capital

30

greater than one, would cause capital deepening and a fall in the labor share19. Acemoglu and
Restrepo (2016) and Brynolfsson and McAfee (2014) have argued that capital-augmenting
technological change – enabling the mechanization and automation of production – may be
responsible for the decline in the labor share; assumptions about economic structure and the
endogeneity of technological progress then determine whether this fall in the labor share is
temporary or permanent. The IMF World Economic Outlook (2017) attributes about half the fall
in the labor share in advanced economies to technological progress, with the fall in the price of
investment goods and advances in ICT encouraging automation of routine tasks.
Lawrence (2015) has a contrasting technology-based explanation: that the falling labor
share is a result of rapid labor-augmenting technological change which has led to a fall in the
effective capital-labor ratio. This, combined with an elasticity of substitution between labor and
capital less than one, would cause a fall in the labor share.
Grossman, Helpman, Oberfield and Sampson (2017) argue that the labor share is
increasing in the rate of technological progress through its effects on human capital
accumulation, and therefore attribute the recent decline in the labor share to the productivity
slowdown.
Many authors on the other hand argue that technological change is not the primary driver
of the decline in the labor share. Non-technology focused theories of the decline in the labor
share include the effect of offshoring of labor-intensive production tasks (Elsby, Hobijn and
Sahin 2013), capital accumulation (Piketty 2014, Piketty and Zucman 2014), reductions of

19

This possibility was raised by Jones (2003), who argued that differences between the short- and long-run
elasticities of substitution between capital and labor could explain trends in the labor share and relative price of
investment goods.

31

worker bargaining power as a result of changing labor market institutions (e.g. Levy and Temin
2007, Solow 2015, Mishel and Bivens 2015, OECD 2012, Bental and Demougin 2010),
industrial structure explanations including increased firm concentration in “winner-take-most”
markets (Autor et al 2017) and increased markups (Barkai 2017), and dynamics in the housing
market (Rognlie 2015).

Rising top-half labor income inequality (mean/median compensation divergence):
The growing “wedge” between mean compensation and median compensation is a manifestation
of rising top-half labor income inequality. This rise in top-half labor income inequality has had
various different dimensions. At a broad-brush level, the 90-50 wage ratio has risen steadily
since around 1980; over the same period, top income shares including the top 1% and top 0.1%
have rapidly risen20.
A number of pure technology-based explanations of rising labor income inequality have
been put forward, which focus on changes in the pace or nature of technological change.
Examples of these are capital-skill complementarity (Griliches 1969, Krusell et al 2000),
computerization increasing the pace of skill upgrading (e.g. Autor, Katz and Krueger 1998),
routine-biased technological change altering task demand and contributing to the “hollowing
out” of middle-skill jobs (e.g. Autor 2010), and automation and the use of robots (e.g. Acemoglu
and Restrepo 2017).
Goldin and Katz (2007) argue that rising labor income inequality in the late twentieth
century was not caused by technology alone: rather, against a roughly constant pace of skill-

20

See, for example, Goldin and Katz (2007), Lemieux (2008), Autor, Katz and Kearney (2008) and Atkinson,
Piketty and Saez (2011) for descriptions of these trends.

32

biased technological change, the rate of increase in educational attainment slowed, leading to
rising education premia and rising income inequality as a result.
Non-technological explanations of rising top-half labor income inequality include
declining unionization (e.g. Freeman et al 2016, Rosenfeld et al 201621), lower top marginal tax
rates (Piketty et al 2014), globalization, including rising trade with China and other low-cost
manufacturing hubs (e.g. Autor et al 2013), increased low-skill immigration (e.g. Borjas 2003),
and the “superstar” effect as globalization or technological change increase market size and
returns to being the best (e.g. Rosen 1981, Gabaix et al 2016, Jones and Kim forthcoming).

Implications of technology-based theories of rising inequality
In general, pure technology-based theories of the falling labor share or rising top-half wage
inequality have a testable implication. If the fall in the labor share has been caused by
technological change and the mechanism operates over the short to medium term, we should
expect the labor share to fall more quickly in periods where labor productivity growth is more
rapid, under the natural assumption that the technological change in question also increases labor
productivity22. Similarly if the rise in the mean/median compensation ratio has been caused by
technological change, we should expect that ratio to rise faster in periods of faster labor
productivity growth23.

21

In earlier work, Freeman (1993) and DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) among others argue that the decline in
unionization significantly increased labor income inequality during the 1980s/1990s.
22
For theories where the mechanism is longer-term we would not expect to observe a short/medium-term
relationship between productivity growth and changes in the labor share. One theory to which this may apply is
Grossman et al (2017) which operates through changed incentives for human capital accumulation.
23
Note that the correlation between short- and medium-horizon changes in the mean/median ratio and changes in the
labor share is relatively low (around 0.25-0.3) and not significant, making it seem a priori unlikely that the same
factor is causing both trends.

33

Over a medium-term horizon, the opposite has occurred in the US (Table 6). During the
productivity boom of 1996-2003, the labor share actually rose, and the mean/median
compensation ratio increased less quickly than in the periods of slower productivity growth
before and afterwards. Indeed the period over which the labor share has fallen most in recent
decades has been a period of productivity slowdown.

Data from BLS, Penn World Tables, EPI Data Library

Bivens and Mishel (2017) marshal a variety of evidence in this vein to suggest that the pure
technology-based theories for rising US income inequality are weak. They argue that a number
of indicators of the pace of automation – productivity growth, capital investment, and IT and
software investment – increased rapidly in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a period which saw
“the best across-the-board wage growth for American workers in a generation”, while in periods
of rapidly widening inequality from 1973-1995 and 2005-present these indicators increased more
slowly.
It could still however be the case that these medium-term correlations mask the
underlying relationship. Short-term fluctuations in productivity growth provide us a simple
natural quasi-experiment to test the implications of pure technology-based theories of rising
income inequality: when productivity growth is faster, the labor share should fall more quickly,
and the mean/median compensation ratio should increase more quickly.

If pure technology-based theories of rising inequality are correct, we should expect to see
a negative and significant coefficient on the change in log of productivity in the labor share
regressions and a positive and significant coefficient the change in log of productivity in the
mean/median compensation regressions.
In addition, particular technology-based theories lend themselves to particular testable
implications. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) argue that the labor share has fallen because as
the relative price of investment goods has fallen, firms have substituted capital for labor (under
the assumption of an elasticity of substitution between labor and capital greater than one). Under
the same logic as above, this should imply that in periods where the relative price of investment
goods falls more quickly, the labor share should fall faster. We run the following regression to
test this:

We use the Penn World Tables measure of the labor share, which covers labor

compensation for the total US economy as a share of GDP. As raised by Johnson (1954), Kravis
(1959) and others, the imputation of the income of self-employed proprietors to labor or capital
can matter significantly for labor share calculations. The PWT measure imputes mixed income of
the self-employed to labor according to the average labor share in the rest of the US economy25.
This appears to be the most plausible measure for the US, based on the occupational
demographics of the self-employed (Feenstra, Inklaar and Timmer 2015, Elsby, Hobijn and
Sahin 2013), and is consistent with much of the literature on the labor share26. However others
including the BLS use alternative approaches27, and so for robustness, we repeated our
regressions with the BLS measures of the labor share for the total economy and the nonfarm
business sector. These do not show substantially different results from our baseline results, and
are available on request28.

Productivity and the labor share: results
Table 7 shows results from our baseline specification (3-year moving average), and Table
8 shows the coefficient estimates on productivity in regressions with varying moving average
bandwidths. The majority of specifications show a negative relationship between changes in

25

Gollin (2002) discussed three different reasonable methods to impute mixed income when calculating the labor
share, of which this is one. Kravis (1959) introduced a similar set of approaches.
26
This approach is followed by Elsby et al (2013), who argue strongly against a wage-based approach and instead
favor a labor share imputation or the Kravis “asset basis” approach. Some other recent examples using this approach
include Koh et al (2016), Valentinyi and Herrendorf (2008), Caselli and Feyrer (2007), Gomme and Rupert (2004).
Rognlie (2015) and Piketty and Zucman (2014) follow a very similar method, assuming that the noncorporate sector
(excluding housing) has the same net capital share as the corporate sector. Krueger (1999) describes a common
convention since Johnson (1954) to impute 2/3 of mixed income to labor, which approximates the US economywide labor share: this has been used by Christensen (1971), Abel et al (1989) and Geerolf (2013) among others.
27
The BLS imputes the compensation of proprietors under the assumption that their hourly compensation is the
same as that of the average employee in each sector (BLS 2008, Giandrea and Sprague 2017). Bentolila and SaintPaul (2003) use a similar wage-based imputation. Bridgman (2014) and Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) only
investigate the corporate labor share, which avoids the need to impute the income of self-employed proprietors to
either labor or capital.
28

In addition Bridgman (2014) shows that the use of gross rather than net labor shares can have a significant impact
on calculations of the US labor share decline. Calculating the labor share using Net Domestic Product rather than
Gross Domestic Product does not significantly alter the outcomes of our regressions.

36

productivity growth and changes in the labor share, as would be predicted by technology-based
theories of the labor share decline29. The coefficients tend to be small and insignificant for the
postwar period and for the post-1973 period, but are large and strongly significant for the period
since 2000 over which the labor share has declined. A Quandt likelihood ratio test identifies a
structural break in the relationship at 2002, significant at the 1% level. Taking the estimated
coefficients for the post-2000 period at face value, their magnitude could be economically
significant. They imply that a one percentage point increase in the rate of productivity growth
over 2000-2014 was associated with between 0.07 and 0.43 percent faster declines in the labor
share. The labor share began to fall significantly in the early 2000s, falling by a total of 4.5
percentage points or by 6.5% over 2001-2014 (an annual rate of 0.49% per year), while the
average annual rate of labor productivity growth over 2001-2014 was 1.3%.
Note however that the magnitude of the coefficient for the post-2000 period falls
substantially as the moving average bandwidth increases: since one would mechanically expect a
negative relationship between contemporaneous productivity growth and compensation growth
after unanticipated productivity shocks, the longer bandwidths may be more reliable estimates of
the underlying relationship. Testing for a significant difference between productivity coefficients
in the pre-2000 and post-2000 period using unrestricted regressions, we find significant
differences at the 5% level for 3-year moving averages, and non-significant differences for 2-, 4and 5-year moving averages. When restricting the coefficients on unemployment and the
constant to be the same over both periods, the difference in productivity coefficients between the

29
Note also that one would mechanically expect some negative relationship between contemporaneous productivity
growth and compensation growth, as a positive unanticipated productivity shock would translate into higher firm
income in the current year, but would be unlikely to feed through to worker compensation until future periods when
compensation is re-set –resulting in a temporary fall in the labor share in years where productivity growth is
unexpectedly high.

37

pre- and post-2000 period substantially declines and is not significant (results in Appendix Table
A12). It’s not a priori clear whether one should expect the cyclicality of the productivity-labor
share relationship or the constant term to have changed since 2000: if not, the restricted
regressions are more appropriate.
Overall the results present a mixed picture. Since there is no apparent relationship
between changes in the rate of productivity growth and changes in the labor share before 2000,
the results do not tend to support theories which posit a long-term underlying relationship
between technology and the labor share. The larger and negative coefficient estimates since 2000
provide some support for theories that attribute the labor share decline to a change in the
technology-labor share relationship since 2000, but since these estimates are rather sensitive to
the time horizon and methodology used, they do not provide robust support.

Falling relative price of investment goods and the labor share: results
As discussed above, one of the dominant technological theories of the decline in the labor share
relates to the falling relative price of investment goods (Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014). If the
falling relative price of investment goods is driving the decline in the labor share as firms
substitute capital for labor, one should expect to see periods of faster decline in the relative price
of investment goods coinciding with periods of faster decline in the labor share. As shown in
Table 9, there is no significant relationship between the change in log labor share and the change
in log relative price of investment goods over the whole postwar period or since 1973. Since
2000 there is a significant relationship but the coefficient estimate is negative, implying that a
fall in the relative price of investment goods has actually been associated with a rise in the labor
share30.

30

There is also no significant relationship between changes in log of the labor share and changes in log of the
relative price of investment goods when using the BLS measures of the labor share.

Productivity and the mean/median ratio: results
If faster technological progress were responsible for the rising mean/median compensation ratio,
one would expect periods of faster productivity growth to be associated with periods of faster
increases in the mean/median compensation ratio. As Table 10 shows, there is no significant
relationship between productivity growth and changes in the mean/median ratio. This casts doubt
on pure technology-based theories of the rising mean/median compensation ratio.

Implications
Over the last four decades in the US, average compensation growth has been slow and
median compensation almost stagnant. Real compensation per hour for the average worker rose
by 48% between 1973 and 2016, or at an annual rate of only 0.9% per year. Real median
compensation per hour rose only 12% in total between 1973 and 2016 (and real average
production/nonsupervisory compensation by 11%). During the same period hourly labor
productivity rose by 75% or 1.3% per year.
In contrast, over the period 1948-1973, average pay for Americans rose both much more
quickly and in line with productivity. Real compensation per hour for the average worker rose by
106% or at a 2.9% annual rate. Real average compensation per hour for production and
nonsupervisory workers – whose pay is likely to have been similar to that of the median worker
over the period (Bivens and Mishel 2015) – rose at a 2.6% annual rate. Hourly labor productivity
rose at a 2.7% annual rate.
As such, a period of slower productivity growth since 1973 has coincided with a period of
even slower pay growth. Productivity has grown relatively slowly, average pay slower still, and
median and production/nonsupervisory pay barely at all.
In the introduction, we introduced a spectrum of possible interpretations of these divergences
between productivity and typical and average pay: at one end of the spectrum, the “strong
delinkage” view where factors are impeding the productivity-pay transmission mechanism such
that productivity growth no longer systematically translates into growth in workers'
compensation, and at the other end of the spectrum the “strong linkage” view where productivity

41

growth translates one-for-one into pay growth but a variety of other factors have been putting
downward pressure on workers' compensation.
Our regressions of compensation growth on productivity growth are supportive of substantial
linkage between productivity and compensation for both typical and average compensation.
Almost all specifications strongly reject the “strong delinkage” hypothesis, and the “strong
linkage” hypothesis of a one-for-one relationship between productivity growth and compensation
growth cannot be rejected for either median or average compensation (while it is rejected for
production/nonsupervisory compensation).
A one percentage point increase in the rate of productivity growth has been associated with
an increase in compensation growth of 0.7 to 1 percentage points for the median worker and for
average compensation over 1973-2016, and of 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points for the average
production/nonsupervisory worker. Evidence on different deciles of the wage distribution also
shows large and significant positive co-movement between productivity and wages at middle
percentiles of the distribution.
Overall, our results suggest that productivity growth has been acting to push up typical and
average compensation to a significant degree over recent decades. As such other orthogonal
factors are likely to be responsible for creating the wedge between productivity and pay in the
US economy, suppressing typical workers’ incomes even as productivity growth acts to increase
them.
The increasing wedge between productivity and median compensation has two key
components: rapidly rising labor income inequality has caused mean and median compensation
to diverge, and a falling labor share has caused productivity and mean compensation to diverge.

42

Many different explanations have been proposed to explain these two divergences. Several
explanations focus on the role of technological change – both to explain the divergence in mean
and median compensation, and to explain the falling labor share. These pure technology-based
theories would imply that in periods where productivity growth is faster, productivity and
median pay should diverge more rapidly. We test this using the natural quasi-experiment of
fluctuations in productivity growth.
There is little evidence of significant co-movement between productivity growth and the
labor share in the US over long periods (since 1948 and since 1973), but we find some evidence
of a significantly negative relationship between productivity growth and the labor share since
2000. Taken together the results tend not provide strong support for purely technology-based
theories of the labor share decline. We find no significant relationship between the mean-median
ratio and productivity growth over the last four decades, and very small coefficient estimates,
providing little support for purely technology-based theories of the rising mean/median
compensation ratio.
It is interesting to compare the relative magnitude of changes in compensation inequality, the
labor share and productivity growth using some simple counterfactuals. If the ratio of the mean
to median worker's hourly compensation in 2016 had been the same as it was in 1973, and mean
compensation remained at its 2016 level, the median worker's pay would have been around 33%
higher. If the ratio of labor productivity to mean compensation in 2016 had been the same as it
was in 1973 (i.e. the labor share had not fallen), the average and median worker would both have
had 4-8% more hourly compensation all else constant31. Assuming the relationship between

31

The estimate depends on which measure of the labor share decline is used.

43

compensation and productivity estimated in Table 1 holds, if productivity growth had been as
fast over 1973-2016 as it was over 1949-1973, (i.e. if net total economy productivity had grown
at an average of 2.7% per year, rather than 1.3% per year), median and mean compensation
would have been around 41% higher in 2015, holding other factors constant.
These point estimates suggest that that the potential effect of raising productivity growth on
the average American’s pay may be as great as the effect of policies to reverse trends in income
inequality. Conversely they suggest that a continued productivity slowdown should be a major
concern for those hoping for increases in real compensation for middle income workers.
Overall, our central conclusion is as follows: the substantial variations in productivity growth
that have taken place during recent decades have been associated with substantial changes in
median and mean real compensation. This suggests that if productivity accelerates for reasons
relating to technology or to policy, the likely impact will be increased pay growth for the typical
worker. Rather than productivity growth failing to translate into pay growth, our evidence
suggests that other factors are suppressing typical workers’ incomes even as productivity growth
acts to increase them.
Our results suggest that productivity growth still matters substantially for middle income
Americans. Nonetheless the evidence of the past four decades, with stagnating compensation for
the median worker and production/nonsupervisory workers, demonstrates that in the face of
rising inequality productivity growth alone is not necessarily enough to raise living standards
substantially.

Appendix: Data Sources
Labor productivity (USA)
Net labor productivity per hour, total economy: BEA Net Domestic Product, deflated by BEA
Net Domestic Product Price Index, divided by BLS Total Hours, Total Economy.
Compensation and wages (USA)
Average compensation per hour, total economy: BLS Average Hourly Compensation, Total
Economy, deflated by the CPI-U-RS since 1978 and the CPI-U before 1978.
Median compensation per hour, total economy: Data obtained from EPI who calculated it as
follows: Nominal median hourly wages, estimated using microdata from the CPS-ORG,
multiplied by ratio of real compensation to wages. Real compensation/wage ratio was calculated
by obtaining nominal compensation/wage ratio from BEA NIPA data and deflating the insurance
component by the PCE medical care index and the rest of the series by the PCE. Further details
in Bivens and Mishel (2015).
Average compensation per hour, production and non-supervisory workers: Data obtained
from EPI who calculated it as follows: Average hourly earnings for production/nonsupervisory
workers from BLS CES since 1964, estimated pre-1964 using average hourly earnings for
production workers, multiplied by real compensation/wage ratio. Further details in Bivens and
Mishel (2015).
Wages by decile of the wage distribution: Data obtained from EPI State of Working America
Data Library, which calculates nominal hourly wages by percentile from the CPS-ORG survey
and deflates by the CPI-U-RS.
Other data (USA)
Unemployment rate: Unemployment rate ages 25-54, Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Labor share: our baseline measure is the share of labour compensation in GDP from the Penn
World Tables, obtained from the FRED database. We also use the Bureau of Labor Statistics
measures of the labor share for the total economy and for the nonfarm business sector.
Relative price of investment goods: we use Di Cecio’s measure from DiCecio (2009). "Sticky
wages and sectoral labor comovement," Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 33(3): 53853, available from the FRED database. This is calculated as the investment deflator divided by
the consumption deflator. We cross-check against Karabarbounis and Neiman’s (2014) measure:
the two are very similar.

This section shows robustness checks using alternate specifications for the baseline regressions.
•

Tables A1-A4 show the baseline moving average regressions with different bandwidths:
1, 2, 4 and 5 years.

•

Tables A5-A7 show the baseline moving average regressions with different controls: A4
removes the unemployment control, A5 adds a time trend and A6 adds decade dummies.

•

Tables A8-A10 show the productivity-labor share moving average regressions with
different bandwidths: 2, 4 and 5 years.

•

Tables A11 and A12 show the pre- and post-2000 restricted and unrestricted regressions
for the baseline productivity-compensation specification and for the productivity-labor
share specification.
