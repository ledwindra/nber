    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper shows that, in a world dominated by vehicle currencies, \ufb01rms engaging in international operations retain currency risk and hedge it real and \ufb01nancially. We employ a unique dataset covering the universe of trade credit, international trade, foreign currency debt, and FX derivatives contracts with \ufb01rms\u2019 census data in Chile (2005-2018). We document that operational hedging is quantitatively limited, as di\ufb00erent maturity, frequency, and amount of FX operations make it di\ufb03cult to net these exposures. The granular \ufb01rms complement real hedging using FX \ufb01nancial instruments, which improve their cash \ufb02ow management and promote their trade and growth.\n\n",
