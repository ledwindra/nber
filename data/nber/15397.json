It is aimed at individuals who are not already familiar with the concepts and terminology used in discussions of trade policy and the domestic and international institutional framework within which U.S. trade policies are formulated and implemented.  Particular attention is devoted to exploring the underlying economic and political conditions that have shaped U.S. trade policies over the period.\n\n",
