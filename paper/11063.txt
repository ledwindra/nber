Wage and Benefit Changes in Response to Rising Health Insurance Costs
Dana Goldman, Neeraj Sood, and Arleen Leibowitz
NBER Working Paper No. 11063
January 2005
JEL No. J33
ABSTRACT
Many companies have defined-contribution benefit plans requiring employees to pay the full cost
(before taxes) of more generous health insurance choices. Research has shown that employee
decisions are quite responsive to these arrangements. What is less clear is how the total
compensation package changes when health insurance premiums rise. This paper examines employee
compensation decisions during a three-year period when health insurance premiums were rising
rapidly. The data come from a single large firm with a flexible benefits plan wherein employees
explicitly choose how to allocate compensation between cash wages and other benefits. Under such
an arrangement, higher health insurance premiums must induce changes in the composition of total
compensation–either in lower after-tax wages or in decreased contributions to other benefits. The
results suggest that about two-thirds of the premium increase is financed out of cash wages and the
remaining one-thirds is financed by a reduction in benefits.

INTRODUCTION
Many companies have redesigned their benefits plans to require employees to pay the full
marginal cost (pre-tax) of more expensive plans. Such ‘fixed subsidy’ schemes have been
discussed for over two decades (Enthoven 1978), but have gotten more attention recently as
health insurance premiums escalate. These schemes are more efficient if workers have different
tastes for health insurance, and research has shown that employee insurance choices are quite
responsive to these arrangements (Buchmueller and Feldstein 1996; Cutler and Reber 1998).
What is less clear is how the total compensation package changes when health insurance
premiums rise. If the premium elasticity of demand for health insurance is less than one—and
the evidence suggests it is (Cutler, 2002)—then workers will increase expenditures on health
insurance as their share of premiums rises. But if labor supply and demand remain fixed, then
total compensation should not change, just its composition into health insurance, wages, and
other benefits (Smith and Ehrenberg 1983). This paper examines whether employees finance
increased health insurance expenditures by reducing current income (essentially wages) or other
benefits (life insurance, disability insurance, and other benefits) in the short-term.
We know of no other work looking at the effects of rising health insurance premiums on
the structure of compensation, although there is evidence on the tradeoff between wages and
fringe benefits. Some of this research tries to estimate the substitution between benefits and
wages using data aggregated at the firm or industry level (Woodbury 1983). These estimates are
somewhat limited because the fringes are often allocated as part of a collective bargaining
agreement or a less explicit process based on worker preferences that calls into question the
underlying assumptions of flexible wages and costless mobility (Freeman 1981; Goldstein and
Pauly 1976). Others have tried to estimate the relationship with employee-level data from

2

multiple firms. The implausible result that wages and benefits do not tradeoff—holding
productivity fixed—are best explained as bias due to unobserved heterogeneity (Smith &
Ehrenberg 1983). Other work exploits natural experiments or time-series variation. Gruber and
Krueger (1990) find that firms facing higher worker’s compensation premiums passed on
approximately 85% of the costs to employees in the form of lower wages. Gruber (1994) finds
that all of the cost increases associated with state and federal mandated maternity benefits in the
late 1970’s and early 1980’s were passed on to the female population in the form of lower wages.
A similar type of cost shifting appears to occur with employee Social Security payroll taxes,
which could be interpreted as reducing wages to finance retirement benefits (Brittain 1971;
Vroman 1974; Hamermesh 1979).
In this paper, we examine employee compensation decisions during a three-year period
when health insurance premiums were rising rapidly. The data come from a single large firm
with a flexible benefits plan wherein employees explicitly choose how to allocate compensation
between cash wages and other benefits, such as health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and
dental benefits, and these decisions are recorded for each employee. Such cafeteria-style plans
cover 13% of workers in medium and large firms, and the proportion is growing, so they are also
interesting to study in their own right (BLS 1999). Under such an arrangement, higher health
insurance premiums must induce changes in the composition of total compensation–either in
lower after-tax wages or in decreased contributions to other benefits—and we observe these
tradeoffs. The results suggest that about two-thirds of the premium increase is financed out of
cash wages and the remaining one-thirds is financed by a reduction in benefits.
Our focus is on responses to premium increases because we are interested in the
allocation of compensation to the actual costs faced by the employee. However, there is a

3

distinction that should be made between the price of insurance and the premium paid. Most
importantly for our purposes, premiums reflect not only the price, but also the expected benefits.
This is a point we will come back to later when we interpret our findings. In the subsequent
section, we describe our data, methods and results. We then discuss their implications for policy.
DATA
The original data set consists of three years (1989-1991) of earnings and benefit
information for employees under age 65 at a single U.S. company.1 We use data from the threeyear period of 1989-1991—a period characterized by large premium increases well above the
rate of inflation similar to the rapid premium growth situation in 2000-2001—as shown in
Figure 1. Our study focuses on a sample of single employees who signed up for a health
insurance plan2. Families are excluded because we have no information on the health insurance
opportunity sets of spouses, and how those might change over time. These employees are
geographically dispersed across 47 states. The data also include a limited set of demographic
controls such as age and sex. Since we analyze changes in employees’ allocation decisions
relative to the previous years, we restrict our attention to employees with at least two years of
data – resulting in an analysis sample of 7,896 employee-year observations.
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the sample. Total compensation averaged
$27,412. Approximately 2.3% of compensation ($623) went towards the purchase of health
insurance, 1.1% ($286) went towards purchase of other benefits within the cafeteria plan and the
remaining compensation was taken as wages. Employees in this firm were given a menu of

These data were obtained from a benefits consulting firm. The terms of the data release preclude us from
providing detail about the company.

We excluded a small number of single employees (222) who did not enroll in the employers health plan
despite a free catastrophic health plan option.

benefit options. To finance these benefits each employee was also given a completely fungible
credit allocation that depends on salary and job tenure. However, the credit allocation does not
determine expenses on benefits as employees can make additional pre-tax deductions from their
salaries or wages to finance benefits. In addition, employees can also choose to cash –out most of
their credit allocation.
Table 2 shows the mean, standard deviation and probability of contributing, for each
benefit component of total compensation in 1990. Employees spend their total compensation on
wages, health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health care savings
account,3 retirement plan, accident insurance, survivor insurance, and life insurance to cover
dependents. Some of these components are rarely used, and the contributions are small. Rather
than estimate models for all of them, we aggregate these into three broad categories – wage,
health insurance and other benefits. Although the benefits in the “other benefits” category are
diverse, they are conceptually related. Most of them are insurance products that involve forgoing
current consumption (in terms of premiums) for future and uncertain payouts.
Table 3 shows the enrollment in each year for the different health insurance plans offered
by the firm. The company offers two types of health insurance plans: fee-for-service (FFS) plans
and HMOs. Table 3 shows that within the FFS class, there are three types of plans: a catastrophic
plan with a deductible of 5% of salary, a low option plan with deductibles of $300 for
individuals, and a high option with deductibles of $150. The other plans consist of 43 HMOs
nationwide, with each employee’s available options depending on state of residence and year.
As with most employers, this company contributes towards the purchase of these plans.
Unlike many employers, however, the amount does not vary by plan choice, but depends only on

qualifying health care expenses. Unused funds left in the account at the end of the year are forfeited.

the number of beneficiaries. By not contributing more generously to more expensive plans, the
employer makes employees face the full marginal cost of more generous coverage (on a pre-tax
basis). The employer’s subsidy—also known as a defined contribution—is equal to the premium
for the catastrophic plan.
Table 4 shows the variation in the copremiums—the amount of total premium paid by the
employee—across plans. HMO copremiums rose faster in absolute and percentage terms from
1989 to 1990. From 1990 to 1991, the premiums in the low-deductible FFS plan rose faster than
the HMO premiums, but the HMO premiums still increased substantially. The drop in
enrollment in both types of plans (shown in Table 3) during that period may reflect these
premium increases. Table 4 also shows that HMO premiums vary considerably over this period,
sometimes falling as much as 26% or increasing by 34% year-to-year. We exploit this
considerable variation to identify our models.
METHODS
We model how the allocation of total compensation varies with an increase in costs of
health insurance for employees. That is, we want to know the responsiveness of each component
of total compensation (wages, health insurance expenditures, other benefits) to changes in health
insurance costs for employees. The key challenge is to measure changes in the cost of health
insurance for employees.
Ideally, a measure of increase in the cost of health insurance would show the difference
in the costs of obtaining a reference level of utility due to a new vector of health insurance
copremiums. However, the problem with constructing this “true cost index” is that utility is not
measurable. To circumvent this problem, alternative estimates of cost changes calculate the
difference in costs of obtaining a fixed basket of goods at a new vector of prices. Two well-

6

known indices are the Laspeyres price index, which measures the difference in costs of
purchasing the base year basket of goods, and the Paasche price index, which measures the
difference in costs of purchasing the current year basket of goods. Although these fixed weight
indices are easy to calculate they induce some bias in the measurement of cost changes. Most
importantly, these indices ignore the possibility of substitution among goods due to changes in
relative prices. For example, employees might switch to cheaper health plans in response to
changes in the relative cost of health plans (This is true in our data as shown in Tables 3 and 4).
Thus using base year enrollment in different health plans as weights for the cost index will
overstate the true increase in the cost of health insurance. Fisher (1922) proposed an index that is
the geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche price index. The Fisher price index has much
lower substitution bias and other desirable properties compared to other fixed weight price
indices (Diewert 1976). In particular it closely approximates the true cost index if preferences
are homothetic. Most statistical agencies use the Fisher index to measure changes in prices and
quantities (Boskin et al. 1998), and this is the index we use to measure change in costs. Since
HMO plan options and copremiums vary with the state we create separate indices for each state
in our data. Details of these calculations are available in the technical appendix.
We estimate separate employee fixed-effects models for each component of total
compensation. Essentially, an employee fixed-effects model controls for employee-specific time
invariant unobservables (such as preferences for insurance) and primarily uses variation in
employee choices and costs over time to identify parameter estimates. Models that ignore these
fixed effects will produce biased estimates if the employee-specific unobservables are correlated
with our explanatory variables. More detail can be found in the technical appendix. To better
illustrate our results we also compute the expenditure elasticity of each benefit category k with

7

respect to the health insurance cost at the mean benefit allocations in 1989. These elasticities can
be interpreted as the percentage change in wages, health insurance expenditures, or other benefit
expenditures due to a one percent change in the cost of health insurance.
Our model assumes that cost increases are exogenous—essentially, that premium changes
reflect shocks to insurance supply for this firm. Thus, we would be suspicious if the premiums
were going up at rates much faster than at other firms, perhaps due to experience-rating.
Fortunately, the premium increases we see at this firm mirror economy-wide trends. According
to Congressional Budget Office testimony, 1990 and 1991 witnessed double-digit rates of
premium growth in two of the largest purchasing groups—the Federal Employee Health Benefits
Program, and the California Public Employees Retirement System—as well as for all employers
based on surveys by Hay/Huggins, Foster Higgins, KPMG Peat Marwick, and the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (Antos 1997).
RESULTS
The estimates for the models for wages, other benefits, and health insurance expenditures
are shown in Table 5. The results show that a $1 increase in the price of health insurance leads
to a 52 cents increase in health insurance expenditures. This 52 cent increase in health insurance
expenditures is financed by a 37 cent reduction in take home wages and a 15 cent reduction in
other benefits. Thus approximately 70% of the increase in health insurance expenditures due to
increase in premiums is financed by wage reductions. Put in elasticity terms (Table 6), each
100% increase in the price of health insurance leads to a 50% increase in health insurance
expenditures, a 1% decrease in take home wages, and a 28% decrease in other benefits.

DISCUSSION
To help interpret our results, it is useful to first consider what would happen if an
individual did not change health plan choices when faced with fixed compensation. To make
this more concrete, we suppose there is an employee who makes $30,000 a year and is currently
paying $600 annually for health insurance. The individual also allocates $400 to other benefits,
leaving $29,000 for cash wages. We now suppose the cost of that insurance rises 50% to $900.
Since total compensation remains fixed, if this employee continues to purchase insurance, he will
have to reduce either wages or other benefits by $300. If he chooses to split the increase so that
wages decline by $200 and other benefits by $100, then wages will fall by only 0.7% (from
$29,000 to $28,800) whereas spending on other benefits falls by 50% (from $400 to $200).
Thus, the elasticities—which are computed as the percentage increase in expenditures on each
component of compensation divided by the 50% premium increase in our example—would be
1.0 for health insurance expenditures, -0.014 for wages, and 1.0 for other benefits. On the other
hand, if the employee dropped coverage, the corresponding elasticity would –1.0 for health
insurance expenditures. The savings of $600 from not buying health insurance any more could
be allocated to both wages and other benefits, resulting in positive elasticities for those
components of compensation.
We estimate an elasticity for health insurance expenditures of 0.5, indicating that
employees facing an increase in the price of health insurance respond by lowering their level of
insurance coverage. However, employees do not completely substitute away from health
insurance—in fact, increases in prices lead to increases in health insurance expenditures.
These increases in expenditures on health insurance are accommodated by reducing both
the take-home income and other benefits such as life insurance, disability insurance, dental

9

insurance and retirement benefits. Thus, our results suggest that rising health insurance prices not
only reduce resources for current consumption but also lower insurance purchases against a
variety of risks. If health insurance prices continue to rise and individuals continue to reduce
their purchase of health insurance and other insurance products that might leave them vulnerable
to health, mortality, disability and other significant risks in the long run.
How do employees reduce their expenditures on health insurance in the face of rising
premiums? There are essentially two options. An employee can drop health insurance
completely, or they could switch to a less-generous plan. As an example of the latter, one could
imagine an employer offers two plans: a generous plan that costs $500 annually; and a less
generous plan that costs $375. If both premiums rise 100% in the subsequent year, an employee
who switches from the more generous plan to the less generous one would see their health
insurance expenditures rise from $500 to $750. (This would imply an elasticity of 0.5, as we
observe in our data.) In fact, single employees in this company did leave their health plans for
less costly options. HMO premiums rose 25% between 1989 and 1991, and the premium on the
most generous FFS plan rose by 29% (Table 4). At the same time, enrollment in the most
generous FFS plan fell 9 percentage points (from 43% to 34%), and enrollment in HMOs fell 6
percentage points (from 43% to 37%). Enrollment rates in the catastrophic plan more than
doubled (from 6% to 15%); and enrollment in the high-deductible FFS plan increased from 9%
to 14%.

More detailed analysis by Goldman, Leibowitz, and Robalino (2004) using

multivariate analysis tells a similar story.
To understand the implications for policy, we need to recognize why premiums are
rising. If premiums rise because administrative costs rise—thereby leaving the underlying value
of the health insurance unchanged—then we would expect fewer people to take up coverage.

10

However, if premiums rise because of an increase in medical care costs (such as new but
expensive treatments), the story becomes more complicated. On the one hand, insurance may
actually become more valuable if these treatments are very efficacious. However, if these
treatments are not very effective—and only serve to drive up costs—then we would expect
people to switch to less generous plans that might not cover or use these treatments. At the
extreme, people might drop expensive private coverage altogether and rely on ‘safety-net’
options (Cutler, 2002). (In our data, the safety-net is a catastrophic plan that is offered free to
single employees.) Thus—whatever the cause of premium increases—our findings suggest that
single employees do not seem to value them very highly and therefore switch to less generous
plans. This also suggests that as health insurance premiums continue to rise, we will see fewer
employees taking up generous health insurance, including HMOs. One important caveat is
worth noting. In our data, the premiums on the HMO plans were, on average, more than the feefor-service alternative. Nationwide this is not the case. In any event, plans that encourage
consumers to reduce waste—such as catastrophic plans or otherwise consumer-driven—would
seem to have the upper hand.

Qs,t = Q1,s ,t , Q2,s ,t ,.., Q j ,s ,t ,.., QJ ,s ,t represents the percentage of employees enrolled in each of
the J health plans in state s in year t, then the Fisher index for state s in year t is defined as4:

Fishers ,t =

Ps,t .Qs,89

Ps,t .Qs,91

Ps ,89 .Qs ,89

Ps ,89 .Qs ,91

Finally we create a price of insurance variable for each state s in year t ( Prices ,t ) by
multiplying the Fisher index for each state-year with the average copremiums in that state in
1989. This essentially rescales the unit-less Fisher index to 1989 copremium dollars in each state
and thus makes our regressions results easy to interpret.
Prices ,t = Fishers,t * ( Ps,89 .Qs,89 )

We estimate separate employee fixed-effects models for each component of total
compensation. Essentially, an employee fixed-effects model controls for employee-specific time
invariant unobservables (such as preferences for insurance) and primarily uses variation in
employee choices and prices overtime to identify parameter estimates. Models that ignore these
fixed effects will produce biased estimates if the employee-specific unobservables are correlated
with our explanatory variables. If i and t subscript the employee and year then our empirical
model can be summarized by the following equations:
Wagei ,t = α iwage + δ wage Pricei ,t + β wage X i ,t + ε iwage

The base year is 1989 and 1991 is the current year

,t
Health Insurancei ,t = α ihealth + δ health Pricei ,t + β health X i ,t + ε ihealth
,t
Total Compensationi ,t = Wagei ,t + Benefiti ,t + Health Insurancei ,t ∀i, t

Where, α k represents the employee fixed effects for benefit k, δ k measures the increase
in expenditures on wage or benefit k due to a one dollar increase in the price of health insurance,
and similarly the vector β k measures the changes in benefit k due to changes in other covariates X
in our model. The last equation is an accounting identity and states that expenditures on wages,
health insurance and other benefits add up to the total compensation of the employee. It, along

δ k = 0 . That is, given that total

with the three previous behavioral equations, also implies that
k

compensation is fixed, any change in health insurance expenditures due to rising health insurance
prices must be financed entirely by changes in benefits or wages.
We also compute the expenditure elasticity of each benefit category k with respect to the
health insurance price at the mean benefit allocations in 1989 as follows:

ξk =

δ k * P89
k
E89

Here ξ k measures the percentage change in expenditures on benefit k due to a one percent
k
change in the price of health insurance, δ is the parameter estimate from the wage, benefit, and

k
health insurance equations, P89 is the mean health insurance price in 1989 and E89
is the mean

expenditure on benefit k in 1989.
