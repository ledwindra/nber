    "abstract": "\n\nNew technology promises to expand the supply of \ufb01nancial services to small businesses poorly served by the banking system. Does it succeed? We study the response of FinTech to \ufb01nancial services demand created by the introduction of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). We \ufb01nd that FinTech is disproportionately used in ZIP codes with fewer bank branches, lower incomes, and a larger minority share of the population, as well as in industries with little ex ante small-business lending. FinTech\u2019s role in PPP provision is also greater in counties where the economic e\ufb00ects of the COVID-19 pandemic were more severe. We estimate that more PPP provision by traditional banks causes statistically signi\ufb01cant but economically small substitution away from FinTechs, implying that FinTech mostly expands the overall supply of \ufb01nancial services, rather than redistributing it.\n\n",
