    "abstract": "\n\nThe consensus view among economic historians is that wage inequality in American manufacturing followed an inverted-U path from the early nineteenth century until just before World War Two. The previous literature, however, has been unable to fully document this path over time, or fully assess the role of explanatory factors such as changes in firm organization and technology. We provide fresh evidence that allow us to better document the inverted-U and its causes. In the first part of the paper, we use the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s 1899 \u201cHand and Machine Labor\u201d study to argue that wage inequality within manufacturing establishments rose over the nineteenth century, primarily because of increasing division of labor  In the second part, we use data for Massachusetts from state reports to  construct a new time series on wage inequality among production workers, which declined from the early 1890s to the late 1930s, mainly because of compression in the left tail of the distribution. Analysis of industry panel data suggest that electrification was the main factor behind the compression.\n\n",
