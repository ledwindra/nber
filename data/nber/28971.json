    "abstract": "\n\nWe show how uncertainty shapes corporate asset allocation, composition, and productivity using data from the shipping industry. Firms curtail both ship acquisitions and disposals when uncertainty increases, primarily through cuts in new ship orders and ship demolitions\u2014decisions that are costlier to reverse vis-\u00e0-vis secondary market transactions. Uncertainty also prompts firms to concentrate their fleets into narrower, less productive portfolios. We corroborate our findings using the 2009-2011 spike in Somali pirate attacks as an uncertainty shock to shipping activity. Uncertainty hampers \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d slowing both the adoption of innovation embodied in new capital and the disposal of old capital.\n\n",
