Political Borders and Bank Lending in Post-Crisis America
Matthieu Chavaz and Andrew K. Rose
NBER Working Paper No. 22806
November 2016
JEL No. F36,G28
ABSTRACT
We use spatial discontinuities associated with congressional district borders to identify the effect
of political influences on American banks’ lending. We show that recipients of the 2008 public
capital injection program (TARP) increased mortgage and small business lending by 23% to 60%
more in areas located inside their home-representative’s district than elsewhere. The impact is
stronger if the representative supported the TARP in Congress, was subsequently re-elected, and
received more political contributions from the financial industry. Together, these results suggest
that political considerations influence credit allocation in a politically mature system like the
United States without the formal possibility of political interference in lending decisions, and that
this influence is larger if the flows between banks and politicians are reciprocal.

1. Introduction
Do political considerations influence corporate investment? The political economy
literature suggests that politicians seek to encourage investments that increase either their
constituents’ welfare, or their own (Shleifer and Vishny, 1994). In turn, firms may benefit from
responding to political influences, if, for instance, this increases their access to the public safety
net (Faccio et al., 2006) or their influence on key votes (Mian et al., 2010).
The banking industry provides compelling evidence of political influence on bank
lending in developing countries (Khwaja and Mian, 2005; Dinc, 2005; Cole, 2009; Carvalho,
2014) and in advanced economies like Italy (Sapienza, 2004). However, a limitation of this
literature is that it draws on government-controlled banks in environments with weak
institutions. Thus, it is unclear whether banks also respond to political influences in highly
developed political and regulatory systems such as the United States, which provide few explicit
possibilities of political interference in lending decisions.
The absence of American evidence to date is significant, given America’s exceptional
role in the global financial system and the 2008-09 crisis. Influential descriptive accounts of the
run-up to the crisis attribute misallocations in US mortgage supply to political distortions (Rajan,
2011; Calomiris & Haber, 2014). Mian et al. (2010) provide evidence that politicians catered to
banks’ interests when voting on key issues like the 2008 Troubled Assets Relief Program
(hereafter “TARP”); this suggests that the crisis might have further increased the relevance of
connections between politicians and banks. 1
This paper proposes a novel strategy to identify political influences on the lending
decisions of American banks. Our strategy exploits three key features unique to the United

1

States. First, the borders of the (435) American congressional districts provide spatial
discontinuities between areas that are similar from economic, regulatory and cultural standpoints,
yet belong to different political constituencies. Since most banks are active in multiple districts,
these borders allow us to explore how the same bank behaves in different constituencies.
Second, American data provides comprehensive coverage of mortgage and (to a lesser
extent) small business lending, broken down by banks, years and geography. This rich
information set allows us to compare lending behaviors in small geographical units belonging to
different congressional districts, while controlling for other (non-political) determinants of
lending, like credit demand. Further, the (relative) transparency of the American legislative
process provides data for politicians’ votes on issues crucial for banks such as the TARP.
Finally, the TARP provides a shock to the political connections between banks and
politicians. This unprecedented injection of public capital into US banks did not formally allow
Congress to affect participants’ lending decisions. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that
Congress could exert informal pressures via media appearances, congressional hearings or
threats to impose “lending mandates” on recipients. Importantly, evidence also suggests that
(some) members of Congress helped banks headquartered within their district to get through the
TARP application process (Duchin and Sosyura, 2012). This suggests that informal pressures, or
the threat thereof, may be particularly prevalent in markets inside the congressional district of the
representative for the area in which the bank is headquartered (the bank’s “home district”).
We use a 2006-2010 annual panel of bank-county-level mortgage lending growth to
examine this idea empirically. Our baseline model compares the mortgage growth of TARP
recipients (compared to other banks) after the TARP (as opposed before) in areas located inside

2

the district of their home representative (not elsewhere). We control for other possible
determinants of TARP participation, such as credit demand, in three complementary ways. First,
we saturate the model with county-year (or county-TARP-year) and bank-home fixed effects.
Second, we focus on mortgages originated in neighborhoods (census tracts) located immediately
next to an intrastate congressional district border. Third, we use Instrumental Variable (IV)
estimators based on banks’ pre-crisis regulatory or political connections (Li, 2013; Duchin &
Sosyura, 2014).
We find that TARP recipients increased mortgage lending by 23% to 60% more inside
the district of their “home” Congress representative; lending in areas outside of the home district
stayed flat or fell, whereas lending inside the home districts increased substantially. This “homedistrict effect” is insensitive and is not explained by public loan guarantees or loan purchases by
Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac),
gerrymandering, or a post-crisis home-district bias. In addition to OLS and IV estimation, we
also find similar results using a matched sample of banks based on their pre-crisis propensities to
participate in the TARP. The home-district effect also holds in a wholly different dataset of
small business lending. In contrast, the effect disappears when we falsify the timing of the
TARP or the precise geographical location of congressional district borders.
We then explore how the home-district effect varies with the intensity of the connection
between the recipient and its home-district representative. We find that the home-district effect
only holds if the representative supported the TARP bill in Congress. The home-district effect is
also stronger if the TARP supporter was re-elected in the 2008 elections and thus able to
influence recipients. Finally, the effect is stronger if the representative received substantial
campaign contributions from the financial industry, a proxy for the representative’s sensitivity to
3

banks’ special interest in congressional votes (Mian et al. 2010). Together, these results are
consistent with political considerations affecting the lending choices of beneficiaries of TARP, in
particular if the ‘flows’ between a bank and a politician are reciprocal.

2. Context in the Literature
To our knowledge, our findings provide among the first formal evidence suggestive of
political influences on bank lending decisions for the modern American banking sector. Our
paper complements Agarwal et al. (2016), who find that banks adopted more lenient foreclosure
procedures inside the districts of members of key congressional committees in 2009-2010. Our
work explores new mortgage lending rather than bank loan renegotiations. However, the two
findings are consistent, as both suggest that political considerations influence bank behavior in a
context of heightened political tension around credit supply. 2
Our results also contribute to several strands of the broader literature on political
connections and corporate behavior. One key contribution is to investigate how political
influences change with politicians vote on legislation of special interest to firms. A large
political economy literature studies whether connections between firms and politicians (e.g., via
political contributions) influence voting behaviors (Snyder, 1990; Mian et al. 2010). Less is
known about how voting affects connected firms’ subsequent behavior. Our findings suggest a
form of reciprocity; banks which have benefited from government support increase lending in
their home-representative’s district, though only if he/she supported the support program in
Congress.

4

Our findings also speak to a literature on political connections and corporate bailouts.
Access to the government safety net is a key reason why political connections boost firm value
(Faccio et al., 2006). Previous research has investigated how political considerations influence
bank bailouts in developing countries (Brown and Dinc, 2005) and industrial countries like
Germany where politicians have formal links with banks (Dam and Koetter, 2012; Behn et al.
2014). 3 But less is known about the behavior of corporates after bailout, and thus about the
benefits that politicians derive from bailouts. Our findings shed indirect light on this question by
showing that publicly supported banks increase lending to the constituents of their home-district
representative.
Our findings also help reconcile a related tension between two parts of the TARP
literature. Black and Hazelwood (2013) and Duchin and Sosyura (2014) find that TARP
recipients increased the riskiness rather than the volume of new lending; Li (2013) find that they
used only one third of their capital injection to support new lending. This mixed outcome
suggests that the TARP fell short of the intentions of its supporters in Congress. This raises
questions around the motives behind congressional activism in facilitating the participation of
banks in their district (Duchin and Sosyura, 2012). Our study sheds light on this puzzle by
showing that participants do indeed lend more … in their home-district representative’s district.
While most studies of the TARP discuss the possibility of political influences on participants
(e.g. Veronesi and Zingales, 2010), ours is the first to explicitly investigate whether and how
these influences affect the allocation of credit.
Our study also adds to the debate concerning the causes of the credit fragmentation that
followed the global financial crisis (e.g., Giannetti and Laeven, 2012). We do not explicitly
search for evidence of aggregate post-crisis financial fragmentation in the United States.
5

Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that financial fragmentation can
result from “financial protectionism,” that is, a distortion of credit flows towards the local
economy after large government intervention in the financial sector (Rose and Wieladek, 2014).
Finally, our results also speak to a broader literature in international trade and finance on
home bias and the border effect. 4 One argument is that borders affect corporate investment
because borders tend to delineate regulatory, fiscal and monetary areas. The problem is that
international political borders – and indeed, many intra-national borders – coincide with
economic, regulatory or cultural borders. We exploit a set-up where areas which belong to
different political constituencies still have similar economic characteristics within a comparable
social and cultural environment.

3. The TARP and Political Influences
The TARP
The Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), a plan to purchase illiquid mortgagebacked (“toxic”) securities from banks, was submitted to Congress on 20th September 2008 as
part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA). The bill initially failed to pass
through the House of Representatives on September 29th; after a stock market collapse that day,
it was reconsidered and obtained a bipartisan majority less than a week later, on October 3rd.
Shortly thereafter, the Treasury announced its intention to use TARP funds primarily to purchase
equity shares in banks. Since this Capital Purchase Program (CPP) mobilized the largest share of
funds initially earmarked for the TARP, this paper studies the behaviour of CPP recipients.

6

Following the TARP moniker which prevails in the media and political discussion, we refer to
CPP and TARP interchangeably.
As of March 2016, $209.1 bn of CPP funds had been used to buy preferred equity in 709
different banks or bank-holding-companies. This started with a forced injection of $125 bn into
nine major American banks on 14th October. Participation was then opened to all domestic
regulated deposit-takers on a voluntary basis, subject to a three-step application process. First,
applications were submitted to and reviewed by the applicant’s local regulator (e.g., a state
branch of the FDIC). Second, this initial review was screened by the applicant’s national
regulator (e.g., the FDIC’s Washington headquarters). Finally, the Treasury made one last
review. Criteria included measures of applicants’ financial health such as capitalization,
liquidity, and local concentration. Once in the program, recipients were subject to a mandatory
5% annual dividend payable to the Treasury.
The Political Context
The beginnings of the TARP were marked by contentious and widely publicized
discussions around the program’s perceived failure to boost lending to “Main Street.” TARP
recipients and congressional supporters were vilified at both Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street
rallies. 5 The TARP “stigma” had concrete repercussions; Ng et al. (2011) find that the media
coverage of TARP recipients was mostly negative, which depressed their stock returns.
The public authorities had no formal way to appease public outrage by encouraging
participants to lend. The Treasury bought non-voting shares (warrants) from banks, and CPP
contracts initially did not contain any covenants on lending, nor on the disclosure of usage of
funds. Oversight bodies, both public (e.g., the US Government Accounting Office) and private
7

tried to fill this gap by monitoring recipients’ behavior. For instance, a 2010 report by the
Woodstock Institute pointed to a decline in mortgage lending to underserved communities in
major American cities by the largest TARP recipients. 6
However, Congress retained an important source of leverage on participants via a
provision to modify ongoing CPP contracts unilaterally. Congress made use of this provision in
2009 to force participants to obtain the Treasury’s approval for executive compensation and CPP
repayment plans, motivating the largest American banks to exit the TARP quickly (Bayazitova
and Shivdasani, 2011; Wilson and Wu, 2012). Congress also discussed using the clause to
impose conditions on lending, prompting some industry observers to “fear that the TARP will
become a vehicle by which Congress will impose credit allocation policies on TARP investees.” 7
While Congress renounced imposing formal lending mandates, it retained informal ways
to encourage lending. Politicians could single out TARP recipients “guilty” of insufficient
lending. 8 For instance, the chairman of the March 2009 hearing “Is TARP working for Main
Street?” invited a deli-owner from his district to testify about the refusal of a TARP recipient to
roll over his loan. In his opening statement, the chairman acknowledged that such hearings
could lead “critics of Congress” to “argue that we are setting out to force banks to lend or
encouraging banks to make bad loans.” 9 TARP architect Henry Paulson himself acknowledged
that “banks rushed to repay because of the associated restrictions on pay levels and the political
atmosphere,” pointing in particular to “calls for mandatory lending” from Congress in 2008; “as
soon as we announced it (…) people were saying, ‘Make them lend. Why aren’t they lending
more?’ … And so I think what happened was then some banks were reticent to take the
capital.” 10

8

Anecdotal evidence suggests that TARP recipients were responsive to local political
circumstances, and could use evidence of lending in key areas to counter criticisms. Confronted
by an Ohio congresswoman about foreclosures in her district, TARP recipient J.P. Morgan
communicated that “the company lent more than $16 billion to more than 3.5 million Ohio
consumers last year and provided $3.8 billion in loans to more than 70,000 companies in the
state.” 11 A couple days ahead of his testimony before Congress, the CEO of (TARP recipient)
MidSouth Bank announced to local TV channel KPLC that his bank “is extending its popular
Town Hall-style meeting series. Two meetings, one on Old Jeanerette Road in New Iberia and
another at the bank’s headquarters on Versailles Boulevard in Lafayette, have been added to the
original 14-meeting series throughout Louisiana and Texas ... ‘The series was a big success in
that it helped us get the message out that we are looking for qualified borrowers …’, Cloutier
said.” 12 Financial Marketing Solutions, a Tennessee-based consultancy offered advice on “how
to communicate acceptance of TARP money”, recommending that banks “promote … TARPdriven opportunities to lend more to the community, sparking new growth and economic
activity”, rather than “defending the media accusation that banks are hoarding the TARP money
to cover losses.” 13
Thus anecdotal evidence suggests that TARP recipients were both exposed and
potentially responsive to political forces in their lending decisions, especially from TARP
supporters in Congress, and that this exposure could differ across constituencies. The “flows”
between politicians and recipients were even explicit in some cases, with states like Ohio
establishing public-private lending partnerships with some local TARP recipients. 14
The TARP remained a contentious issue for both representatives and recipients through at
least the 2010 mid-term elections. 15 Official efforts to boost the impact of the TARP on lending
9

resulted in a number of follow-up programs designed to increase mortgage refinancing (HAMP),
small business credit (SBLF), lending to underserved communities (CDFCI), and other
programs.

4. Methodology and Data
We are interested in whether political considerations matter for credit decisions of banks
which received TARP capital injections. In particular, we seek to determine if these banks lent
more inside the congressional district of the political representative where the bank is
headquartered – the “home district” – than outside.
We choose counties as the baseline unit of a local banking market following much of the
literature (e.g., Gilje et al., 2016). 16 Accordingly, our dependent variable of interest is the
lending growth for a given bank in a particular county for a single year. One complication is that
counties in urban areas often span multiple districts (e.g., in Los Angeles County). Since we are
interested in separating home-district lending from other lending, we further split any multidistrict county by district.
Figure 1 illustrates this strategy for the state of Oklahoma (OK). The thick (black) lines
delineate the five OK districts from the 110th Congress, identified by their number (inside red
circles). Thinner (gray) lines delineate the 77 OK counties. The rural Caddo County (southwest
of Oklahoma City; population 29,600) belongs entirely to the 3rd district. In contrast, the urban
Oklahoma County (around Oklahoma City; population 718,633) spans the 4th and 5th districts. In
the latter case, we split a bank’s annual lending into loans made in the a) 4th and b) 5th districts. 17
In what follows, we refer to these as “county-years” for convenience.
10

Empirical model
We employ a difference-in-difference-in-difference strategy; we examine credit growth
of TARP recipients (as opposed to non-recipients), after the TARP (as opposed to before), in
counties inside a bank’s home district (as opposed to outside). Our empirical model is:
ΔLoani,c,t = βTTARPi,t + βTHTARPi,t∙HOMEi,c + δXi,t + ζZi,c,t + {ηc,t} + {θi,c} + εi,c,t

(1)

where:
•

ΔLoani,c,t is the first difference in the natural logarithm of aggregate mortgage lending
originated by bank i in county c (or county-district c in multiple-district counties), in year t,

•

TARPi,t is a dummy variable which is one if i had received CPP capital by time t, and zero
otherwise,

•

Homei,c is a dummy variable which is one if county c is part of the congressional district in
which bank i is headquartered (using districts from the 110th congress), and zero otherwise, 18

•

δ and ζ are nuisance coefficients,

•

X is a vector of bank controls similar to Duchin & Sosyura (2014), which includes one-year
lags of: size (log total assets, hereafter “TA”); tier-1 capital (%TA); cash (%TA); charge-offs
(% total loans); non-performing loans (% total loans); repossessed real estate (% TA);
deposits (%TA); (log) bank age; return on equity; and exposure to local shocks (average
change in Philadelphia Fed yearly state-level economic activity index, weighted by bank’s
branch presence in a state),

11

•

Z is a vector of borrower controls, which includes weighted average characteristic in a
county-year (using loan size as weight) of: loan-to-income ratio; log income; log loan size;
dummy for ethnic minority (non-Caucasian); dummy for gender (non-male); median family
income in borrower’s census tract; and share of ethnic minority people in borrower’s census,

•

{ηc,t} and {θi,c} are comprehensive sets of county-year and bank-home (district) fixed
effects, respectively, and

•

εi,c,t is a (hopefully) well-behaved residual, to represent all other determinants of loan growth.
The main coefficient of interest is βTH. The parameter captures the differential effect of

the TARP for mortgage growth in counties inside the bank’s home district. βT measures the
effect of TARP on mortgage growth in non-home district counties. We interpret robust
indications of a positive significant βTH to be evidence of a “home-district effect” associated with
political influences.
Estimation
We estimate (1) with four different techniques, clustering the standard errors by bank.
The main econometric challenge is that participation in the TARP could be correlated with
unobserved characteristics of the participants’ home district, besides those linked to political
effects. For instance, a bank anticipating high credit demand in its home district could be more
prone to apply and to be accepted by the regulator. Alternatively, a bank could apply to the
TARP if it anticipates that it would have a comparative advantage in identifying profitable
investments in areas close to its headquarters. 19 We address this challenge in three
complementary ways: a) fixed effects, b) a sample selection highlighting spatial discontinuities
associated with political borders and c) instrumental variables.

12

We remove considerable unobserved heterogeneity via the two sets of fixed effects in (1).
The county-year fixed effects {ηc,t} control for credit demand and economic activity in a given
county-year. 20,21 The bank-home fixed effects {θi,c} control for time-invariant heterogeneity
across banks and the way they behave in home and non-home-district counties, for instance
because of superior local knowledge.
Spatial Discontinuity
We further attenuate unobservable heterogeneity between home and non-home lenders
and counties by measuring ΔLoani,c,t using only loans inside a given county c (or district in a
multi-district county) that are originated in census tracts immediately adjacent to an intrastate
congressional district border. We can do so since our data reports the location of a borrower at
the level of the census tract, a small unit designed to contain a socio-economically homogeneous
population of about 7,000 individuals.
Out of the 77 Oklahoma counties, 33 contain census tracts adjacent to an intrastate
district border (these counties are colored in Figure 1); we thus drop the other 44 counties.
Within the remaining 33 counties, we then focus on census tracts next to district borders. The
mean/median OK county has 12.9/5 census tracts; rural counties have only few tracts, but urban
counties have many. Keeping only “frontier” census tracts allows us to increase the sharpness of
discontinuities (particularly in urban areas). This strategy is illustrated in the close-up map of the
Oklahoma County in Figure 2. The thick (black) lines again delineate districts, while thin (gray
or red) lines separate census tracts. Out of the 227 tracts in Oklahoma County, we only keep
loans from the 33 tracts adjacent to district borders (colored in Figure 2).

13

The goal of zooming onto “frontier” census tracts is to make HOMEi,c irrelevant for nonpolitical reasons. A bank headquartered in downtown Oklahoma City (in the 5th OK district)
might have superior ability to anticipate credit demand or identify investment opportunities in
the average Oklahoma County tract, compared with “outsider” banks or counties. But it is less
plausible that this advantage also characterizes Oklahoma County tracts immediately next to the
5th district border, especially by way of comparison with tracts immediately on the other side of
the same border. This restriction – combined with fixed effects and instrumental variables (see
below) – makes us comfortable with assuming that unobserved home-district characteristics
(such as expected local demand or knowledge) cannot explain selection into TARP, and postTARP lending growth. Since we exclude areas contiguous to any district border which coincides
with a state border, we can also rule out differences due to bank regulation and supervision or the
broader institutional framework.
Instrumental Variable Strategy
A third way to reduce concerns that participation in the TARP is correlated with postTARP district-level heterogeneity is to instrument for a bank’s TARP participation using precrisis bank characteristics. We follow Li (2013) and Duchin and Sosyura (2014) by predicting
TARP participation using pre-crisis connections with regulators and influential Congress
members. We first estimate a cross-sectional probit model of a bank’s i participation in TARP:
TARPi = λConnectionsi + ψXi + ξi

(2)

where
•

Connectionsi is a measure of connections for bank i. We use two measures of connections:

14

1. Fed director is one if an executive director of bank i served on the Federal Reserve
Bank’s Board of Governors or the board of a regional Fed,
2. Subcommittee member is one for bank i if its home-district representative served on
the Financial Institutions Sub-Committee of the 111th Congress,
•

X are control variables, taken from equation (1), using 2008q3 values,

•

λ and ψ are coefficients to be estimated for instrument generation, and

•

ξ is a well-behaved residual.
After estimating (2), we retrieve the fitted values and interact them with a simple dummy

variable (unity post 2007, zero before) to create the time-varying instrumental variable needed
for our panel estimation of βT. That is, we form (𝜆̂ Connectionsi + 𝜓�Xi)∙It where It is one after
� . To estimate βTH we follow the same
2007 and zero otherwise. We call this instrument TARP

procedure, but interact the IV additionally with our home-district dummy variable, which we call
� ∙ Home. 22
TARP

Coefficient estimates from the first stages are presented in Appendix Table A1; it is

� ∙
immediately obvious that ours are not weak instruments. A second condition is that TARP

Home affect ΔLoani,c,t only via its impact on TARPi,t∙Homei,c rather than via factors excluded
� ∙ Home should be uncorrelated with εi,c,t. Duchin and
from model (1). In other words, TARP

Sosyura (2014) show that committee memberships are largely exogenous to bank lending

behavior since they are allocated on the basis of federal political outcomes and rotate regularly.
It would take an even stronger assumption for the exclusion restriction to be violated in our case:
congressional sub-committee membership or Fed directorship would have to be correlated with

15

(post-TARP) credit demand faced by TARP recipients only (since we control for county-year
fixed effects) and only in their home-district, an implausible assumption in our view.
Propensity Score Matching
A final identification challenge is that participation in TARP could proxy for other banklevel variables. For instance, banks may choose to apply based on their financial strength, and
regulators may screen applications based on such factors. Following again Duchin & Sosyura
(2014), as an alternative estimator we use a matched sample consisting of a) all TARP recipients
and b) their closest non-recipient counterpart. To match recipients and non-recipients, we
estimate a probit model of TARP participation similar to (2), but without the political variables
(we also add a dummy for whether a bank is part of a Bank-Holding Company or not). We then
match each recipient to a non-recipient using predicted participation probabilities.
Data and Sample
We focus on the mortgage market, for two reasons. First, its intrinsic importance,
especially for the 2007-09 financial crisis which probably originated in the American housing
market. Second, the relevant dataset is of high quality and covers the majority of the American
market. All financial institutions must report their mortgage origination activity to the FFIEC
under the 1975 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) on a mandatory annual basis,
minimizing the selection bias present for instance in small business lending data. 23 Crucially, the
dataset provides detailed borrower location information, a key requirement for our identification
strategy.
We focus on data for the 2006-2010 period. 24 From the raw dataset, we discard
applications received by non-commercial bank lenders (credit unions, thrifts, subprime
16

specialists, etc.), applications with incomplete location or income information, applications in
overseas territories, and applications for unusual products (multi-family dwellings and loans
guaranteed by the Veterans Administration or the Farm Service Agency). This leaves us with
44.8 million mortgage applications.
For each entry, HMDA reports whether the application was accepted, the identity of the
bank, loan-, borrower- and borrower-census-tract characteristics, including loan size, income,
race, and sex. The borrower location is reported at the level of the census tract. We use this
information to discard loans made in tracts not contiguous to an intrastate congressional district
border. This amounts to dropping 53,003 (82.2%) of the 65,310 US census tracts. We used
Census Bureau maps for the 110th congress to map census tracts into districts, and a relationship
file from Brown University to identify contiguous tracts. 25 Finally, we aggregate the data by
bank-county-year (or bank-county-district year in multiple-district counties). The final dataset
spans 8,708 county-year and 5,272 bank-home combinations. While zooming onto “frontier”
tracts allows us to identify the home-district effect cleanly, it discards a substantial share of the
data. Accordingly, we check that our main finding survives when including all US census tracts.
Since the majority of TARP recipients were Bank Holding Companies (BHC) rather than
banks, we aggregate lending data to the BHC level, and refer to “banks” for convenience in what
follows. 26 We typically do not include data for the nineteen biggest US banks, those which
participated in the Fed’s 2009 SCAP stress test; since they were forced to participate in the
TARP, there is no way to separate the effect of TARP from the effect of being a systemically
important bank. 27 We also drop foreign-owned banks ineligible for the TARP, and banks for
which we cannot find the end-2007 headquarter in Call Reports.

17

We add data on TARP recipients taken from the US Treasury’s website and merge it with
HMDA data using the recipient’s name. 28,29 The data indicates the size and timing of a capital
injection into a BHC (or bank), as well as the dates of the initiation and completion of
repayment, if applicable. We observed 672 TARP recipients in our dataset. 30 204 banks entered
the program in 2008, and another 468 participants in 2009. The FDIC’s Call Reports database
provides us with bank-year controls and the unique regulatory identifier of a bank and its parent
BHC. We aggregate all these controls to the BHC-year level. The BHC-level Call Reports
provide us with the BHC’s headquarters location. 31 We use the end-2007 bank headquarters
location, to rule out strategic relocation after the crisis. We again map the headquarter location
into districts using Census Bureau maps. 32 We merge HMDA and Call Reports data using the
regulatory identifier provided by HMDA.
Finally, we find data from the House of Congress website on congressional
representatives, membership in key committees, and voting behavior for TARP-related roll calls.
Data from service on Federal Reserve Bank boards are from Li (2013). 33

5. Main Results
Benchmark Estimates
Our benchmark results are presented in Table 1, which tabulates estimates from OLS
(column 1), both of our instrumental variables (IV, in columns 2-3), and propensity score
matching (PSM, in column 4). We tabulate the {β} coefficients of interest: the effect of TARP
on mortgage-loan growth outside the home-district below, and whether this effect differs

18

significantly between areas inside and outside the home-district (other estimates are available
online).
The effect of the TARP on mortgage lending outside the home-district, tabulated in the
second row, is mixed. In particular, the coefficient tabulated on the bottom row, βT, is
statistically insignificant and small for OLS and PSM estimators, negative and significant for
both IV estimators. In other words, banks that received TARP funds either maintained or cut
lending for areas outside their home-district. Still, our main interest is in the top row, which
tabulates estimates of the home-district effect, βTH. In contrast with the small or negative effect
of the TARP outside the home-district, the parameter for TARP x Home indicates that the effect
of TARP inside the home district is highly statistically and economically significant. Our OLS
estimates indicate that mortgage lending grows (exp(.22)-1≈) 25% more in home districts; the
PSM estimate is comparable. IV estimates suggest an even larger effect, indicating that the
TARP leads to around (exp(.47)-1≈) 60% more lending in the home district. The fact that IV
estimates are larger than the OLS/PSM estimates is consistent with IV measuring the local
treatment effect of being a TARP recipient as the result of connections with a particularly
powerful local politician or regulator. In contrast, OLS and PSM estimators estimate the average
treatment effect of the TARP, including banks which do not “owe” their participation to a
powerful politician or former regulator.
Sensitivity Analysis
Table 2 reports sensitivity analysis for the key coefficient, βTH, the estimate of the TARP
home-district effect. We consider twenty perturbations to our benchmark methodology, and
tabulate OLS, IV, and PSM estimates; our default estimates from Table 1 are recorded on top to
facilitate comparison.

19

First, we consider slightly different definitions of our regressand to check the importance
of loans prone to federal political distortions. We successively and separately eliminate: loans
purchased by Government-Sponsored Enterprises, loans guaranteed by the FHA, and refinance
loans. The home-district effect remains positive and statistically significant throughout these
perturbations. Next, we drop all loans granted in the 40 most gerrymandered districts, as
identified by Mackenzie (2009) based on their geographically abnormal shapes. 34 The results
change little; gerrymandered districts are not the source of our finding. 35 Counties in rural areas
typically belong to one district, while urban counties can span multiple districts. Since political
circumstances may differ across rural and urban areas, we run the baseline regression separately
for a) single-district counties and b) multiple-district counties. The home-district effect is
significant in both samples, with only minor differences in statistical and economic significance.
Next, we account for banks that exit the TARP during the (2006-10) estimation window.
Specifically, we add a separate dummy Exit (along with its interaction with Home), which is
unity once the bank has finished repaying TARP money. This perturbation does not change our
essential results.
Our baseline set-up assumes that BHCs (or banks in the case of independent banks) are
connected to the representative for the district in which the BHC is headquartered. We make this
assumption to conform to the facts that a) TARP funds were granted at the BHC level, and b)
connections between a BHC and its home-district representative predict participation in the
TARP (Duchin & Sosyura, 2012). A (non-mutually exclusive) possibility is that political
connections exist between BHCs and representatives of the districts in which subsidiaries are
headquartered. We thus explore an alternative definition of Home, which is unity not only in a

20

BHC’s home district, but also in any of its subsidiaries’ home district. The resulting homedistrict effect is essentially unchanged.
The next row adds a control Crisis x Home, where Crisis is unity after 2008, and zero
otherwise. This allows us to capture any general retrenchment towards the home district, for
instance if banks seek to strengthen their connection with the home-district representative in a
context of impending regulatory overhaul, irrespective of participation in TARP. The OLS/PSM
estimates are unaffected, and the IV estimates are higher. This suggests that the home-district
effect operates over and above any crisis-induced extra home bias effect. 36
To control for changes in the observable quality of applicants across different banks and
counties, we then replace bank-county-year borrower controls by bank-county-year applicant
controls. This does not materially change results. Dropping all the bank controls also has little
effect on our results.
Another issue to consider is the importance of outliers; we pursue this in two different
ways. First, we winsorize all variables at the 1% level. Alternatively, we drop outliers, defined
as observations with residuals lying more than two standard deviations from the mean. Our
results remain statistically solid through these checks, but the economic magnitude falls by
around a fourth in the second perturbation. This suggests that our headline economic estimates
are somewhat inflated by observations with extreme lending growth.
Yet another set of checks changes the underlying sample of data. We try both shorter
(2006-2009) and longer (2005-2012) spans. This changes little; we obtain similar results, though
they are economically less sizable for the larger window.
Our next checks involve exploring alternative sets of banks and geographies. First, we
put aside our spatial discontinuity approach and include all loans, instead of only those made in

21

tracts contiguous to district borders; this marginally reduces the economic magnitude of our
estimates. Then we add back into our sample the largest (nineteen) American banks (those who
participated in the 2009 stress test). Our results are economically and statistically somewhat
smaller, but they are still significantly different from zero at the 5% level.
We then experiment with standard errors, using state-level clustering. We obtain smaller
standard errors, confirming that bank-clustering is more conservative. Finally, we experiment
with our fixed effects. First, we replace bank-home fixed effects with bank-county fixed effects;
this is of little consequence. 37 Second, we replace county-year with TARP-county-year fixed
effects, again finding comparable results. This suggests that the home-district effect cannot be
explained by changes in average credit demand faced by TARP recipients in their home-district
(the application-level evidence below demonstrates this more directly).
To summarize, we have found that TARP recipients do not provide higher mortgage
growth on average, but they do make substantially more loans to borrowers inside their homerepresentative’s congressional district. Our twenty robustness checks ensure that the homedistrict effect does not depend delicately on minor features of our methodology.
Placebo Tests
We run two placebo tests. In the first, we falsify the timing of the shock. Specifically,
we assume that the TARP recipients receive an equity injection three years before the actual
injection date; we then re-estimate the baseline regression for the 2003-2007 period. The homedistrict coefficient is not statistically significant in this specification for any estimator, suggesting
that our main results are not driven by different pre-shock trends across recipients and nonrecipients.

22

In the second placebo test, we falsify the definition of home districts. Specifically, we
use borders of 1% “super” Public Use Microdata Areas (“PUMA”s) instead of congressional
district borders. Super PUMAs were created by the Census Bureau for the purpose of statistical
representation of 2000 US Census data. Super PUMAs, illustrated in Figure 3, are comparable
to districts in several respects. They are designed to contain about 400,000 individuals, against
700,000 for districts. Like congressional districts, PUMAs do not cross state lines; also, there
can be multiple PUMAs within a county in densely populated urban areas like Oklahoma City.
Importantly, however, PUMA borders rarely coincide with district borders (except by accident,
e.g., between Caddo and Grady counties southwest of Oklahoma City). Therefore, we can
investigate how TARP recipients lend in areas close to PUMA borders as a placebo, since these
do not separate different political constituencies, only statistical areas.
To execute the test, we keep only loans made in census tracts located outside of the
home district and immediately next to an intrastate PUMA border, unless this border coincides
with a congressional district border. We then aggregate mortgages, by bank-county-year, (or
bank-county-PUMA-year for multi-PUMA counties). Finally, we run a regression similar to our
default, but defining Home as 1 if bank i's 2008 headquarter is located in the PUMA in which the
bank headquarters lies, and 0 otherwise.
The results, tabulated in the bottom row of Table 2, show that TARP x Home is not
statistically significant in this placebo exercise. This again suggests that our baseline results are
driven by borders associated with political constituencies. This non-result also suggests that our
baseline result is not driven by a distance effect; that is, TARP recipients do not simply extend
loans close to their headquarters. Just like home-district counties, home-PUMA counties are also

23

closer to the bank’s headquarter than non-home PUMA counties. So, if distance matters, we
would expect to find a significant home-PUMA effect. We do not.
Application-level Evidence
As a final check on our spatial identification strategy, we exploit our mortgage data at the
most disaggregated level possible, that of the mortgage application. We estimate the model:
Acceptedi,a,c,t = βTTARPi,t + βTHTARPi,t∙HOMEi,c + δXi,t + ζZi,a,c,t + {ηc,t} + {θi,c} + εi,a,c,t (3)
where:
•

Acceptedi,a,c,t is 1 if bank i accepts application a in census tract c and year t, and 0 otherwise,

•

Bank controls, borrower controls and the bank-home fixed effect θi,c are similar to the
baseline model, 38 and

•

The location-time fixed effects are discussed below.
The application-level analysis gives a distorted picture of the average home-district

effect, since it a) overweighs large banks and areas and b) only captures changes in acceptance
rates, not lending volume. If a TARP recipient aggressively solicited applications (in line with
anecdotal evidence in section 2) or used its funding advantage to outbid its competitors without
increasing risk-taking, this model would not capture it.
However, this approach has two benefits. First, we can estimate the differential effect of
the TARP a) within a given neighborhood and year (via census tract-year fixed effects) and b)
across a pair of neighborhoods located on either side of an intrastate district border (via census
tract pair-year fixed effects). Second, since it models a mortgage supply decision conditional on

24

a given mortgage demand, this approach removes unobservable individual demand-side effects.
Together, these can help us gauge the robustness of our identification strategy.
We saturate the model with fixed effects in two alternative ways. First, we replace the
county-year fixed effects (used in the baseline model) with census tract-year fixed effects
(henceforth, “within-tract model”). This controls for credit demand and unobservable average
borrower quality within a given neighborhood and period. Combined with the alternative
dependent variable, this approach is the most conservative way to control for demand factors
feasible using HMDA data.
Second, we keep the tract-year fixed effects, but replace the bank-home fixed effects (of
the baseline set-up) with bank-census pair fixed effects (henceforth, “across census pairs
model”). This allows us to control for unobserved heterogeneity in the way a given bank
behaves on average within a pair of two census tracts located on either side of an intrastate
district border. 39
Given the extensive potential number of observations and fixed effects, we drop loans
which play no role in our baseline results according to our robustness checks (see Table 2),
namely loan purchased by GSEs, loans guaranteed by the FHA and refinance loans. 40 We do not
report IV estimates since they often fail to converge, given the high-dimensionality of the fixed
effects. 41
The results in Table 3 indicate a positive and strongly significant coefficient for TARP x
Home. This is true for both OLS and PSM estimates, and for both models (within census and
across census pairs). For instance, the OLS estimate of the within-tract model (column 1)
indicates that, controlling for his/her characteristics, an applicant’s chance to be accepted is 4%
higher if he/she applies with a TARP recipient, and his/her house is located in the bank’s home

25

district. We find comparable estimates in the other three columns. In contrast, the coefficient
for TARP is always negative but statistically insignificant, indicating that borrowers are treated
insignificantly different outside a TARP bank’s home district.
We conclude that at least a portion of the home-district effect can be ascribed to TARP
recipients’ willingness to accept applications from their home district disproportionately.
External Validity: Small Business Lending
Our focus on the mortgage market is partly motivated by data considerations. The
HMDA is the only comprehensive database containing precise information on the geographic
location of borrowers. In principle however, there is no reason why the home-district effect
should not hold for other markets, such as those for commercial and industrial lending. Banks
are the single most important source of credit for small firms, and recipients’ small business
lending was an important focal point of TARP surveillance bodies such as the Congressional
Oversight Panel, and of media discussions around credit supply after the crisis and TARP. 42
This concern may have opened the door to political influences similar to those at work in the
case of mortgage lending.
Accordingly, we investigate the home-district effect in the small business lending market.
We use a panel of small business loans for the 2006-2010 period collected under the auspices of
the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA dataset has two main disadvantages
compared with the HMDA database. First, although a majority of American banks file CRA
reports, participation is voluntary. Second, the publicly-accessible version of CRA aggregates
lending to the bank-county-year level, where HMDA reports application-level data. This has
two implications for our methodology. First, one cannot explicitly control for borrower
characteristics (the vector Z), at least beyond those captured by a county-year fixed effect.

26

Second, we cannot zoom onto loans within a given county granted in census tracts contiguous to
district borders. Instead, we focus on counties which are contiguous to congressional district
borders, within the same state. Note that since urban counties often have multiple districts, this
implies that the sample in this regression is biased towards rural areas. With those exceptions,
our empirical model is the same as that of our baseline model (1).
Table 4 reports OLS, IV, and PSM results for small business lending. We find
qualitatively similar results to the mortgage regression. The coefficient for the home-district
effect ranges from 0.21 (PSM) to 0.48 (IV). As expected from the poorer data quality and
identification, the precision of the effect is lower than with mortgages. The OLS estimate is
significantly different from zero at the 10% level only, though the others are significant at the
5% level. The TARP coefficient is never significantly different from zero in any of the
equations. In other words, the TARP has no significantly discernable effect on small business
lending except inside the recipients’ home-representative congressional district.
These results provide an independent check for our mortgage results; the fact that we find
evidence that is similar both qualitatively and quantitatively with a different dataset supports the
home-district hypothesis, showing that it is robust to idiosyncrasies associated with the mortgage
market and/or HMDA data.

6. Linking the Home-District Effect to the Home Representative
We have established the existence of a “home-district” effect; recipients of public capital
injections have higher lending growth inside their home-representative’s congressional district
than outside. That is, the nature of mortgage and small business lending by TARP recipients

27

appears to have been influenced by political considerations. In this section, we provide
additional evidence to supplement and strengthen our interpretation.
Congressional Votes and 2008 Elections
One key motive for connected corporates is to influence politicians’ votes on key
legislation (Snyder, 1990). We thus begin by investigating whether the home-district effect is
stronger if the home representative voted in Congress for the Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act (EESA), the legislation that created the TARP. The EESA vote divided both Democrats and
Republicans; the EESA was voted down 205-228 on Sept 29, 2008 before being voted through
263-171 on Oct 3, 2008. We focus on the latter vote. Our prior is that any link between TARP
recipients and their home representative will be stronger if the representative supported the
EESA in Congress. A ‘yes’ vote may have signaled a greater ability or willingness to intervene
with the Treasury or bank regulators to help a local bank with access to TARP assistance, or to
exert informal pressure on recipients.
Accordingly, we re-estimate baseline model (1) in Table 5 for two sub-samples: those
with banks whose home representative a) supported and b) opposed the EESA in Congress. Our
main coefficient of interest remains the interaction term TARP x Home, which captures the
home-district effect. The first column (at the extreme left) shows that the home-district effect is
present for banks whose representatives voted for the TARP. Specifically, the coefficient for
TARP x Home is statistically significant and somewhat larger in size than in the baseline
regression (0.28 against 0.22). By way of contrast, the home-district effect in the next column to
the right is small, negative and insignificantly different from zero for banks whose home
representatives opposed the EESA. 43 In other words, political considerations seem to matter
only if the representative’s vote conformed to the special interests of banks.
28

Politicians catering to constituent interests may be more prone to influence bank lending,
for instance to distressed communities. Thus, we then test whether the home-district effect is
also stronger if the representative had voted for the 2008 American Housing Rescue and
Foreclosure Prevention Act (AHRFPA), a federal program supporting mortgage renegotiations
and GSEs. Unlike the EESA, the AHRFPA targeted constituent interests (those of underwater
mortgagors), rather than those of the financial industry (Mian et al. 2010). The third and fourth
columns in Table 5 show that TARP x Home is statistically significant and economically
comparable in samples containing only banks whose representative voted a) for and b) against
AHRFPA. In other words, the home-district effect does not seem to vary with votes on objects
directly targeting constituent interests. 44,45
Together, these results suggest that banks are responsive to political influences when the
‘flow’ with politicians is reciprocal, as proxied by a vote in favor of a key legislation for banks’
special interests. To further support the hypothesis that special interest votes increase political
connections, we test whether the home-district effect is stronger if the home representative was
not only a TARP supporter, but also if she/he remained in office after the 2008 elections. The
111th Congress elections took place on 4th November, only a month after the passage of the
EESA. Re-elected TARP supporters should remain able to influence recipients, and recipients
should remain responsive to this pressure (or the threat thereof).
To check, we further split the sample of banks whose home representative supported
TARP into two sub-groups, depending on whether the representative was subsequently re-elected
or not. Consistently with our intuition, the home-district effect, tabulated in the middle column
of Table 5, remains strongly statistically significant for banks whose home representatives were

29

re-elected, and increases in size to 0.31. By way of contrast, the home-district effect is small in
both statistical and economic terms for banks whose representative was not re-elected. 46
Political Contributions and Ideology
The EESA vote correlates with political contributions from the financial industry
received by a representative and his/her ideology – the higher contributions and the less
conservative, the more likely a ‘yes’ (Mian et al. 2010). 47
Accordingly, we test whether the home-district effect grows with political contributions.
Politicians receiving more contributions are more prone to cater to banks’ special interests in
Congress, and may thus represent a potentially more valuable connection for banks in a context
of impeding regulatory overhaul. We use Mian et al. (2010)’s database to construct a variable
Contributions, which corresponds to the (log) amount received by a 110th Congress
representative (up to November 2008) from a Political Action Committee affiliated to the
financial industry, as measured by the Center for Responsive Politics. Our main interest is the
interaction of Contributions with TARP x Home; this captures whether the home-district effect
increases with the home-representative’s connection to the financial industry. We re-estimate
the augmented baseline model for the sub-sample of representatives which were re-elected in
2008, and thus still able to exert influence. Our result is tabulated in column 5 of Table 5.
Consistent with our intuition, we find that the triple interaction term of interest is positive and
significant (at the 5% confidence level). 48
We then test whether the home-district effect is higher for more liberal representatives.
These representatives are more prone to support government intervention in private markets
(Mian et al., 2010), and thus potentially to exert influence on recipients’ lending. We use a

30

representative’s DW-Nominates index from Mian et al. (2010)’s database, which increases with
conservative ideology. Column 6 in Table 5 shows that the triple interaction between TARP x
Home and ideology is not statistically significant.
Together, these results reinforce the interpretation that banks are responsive to political
influences (or the threat thereof) when the ‘flow’ with politicians is reciprocal. Banks connected
to representatives who support key special interest legislations because of contributions from the
financial industry seem to be responsive. But this is not necessarily the case for banks connected
with representatives who support the same object for ideological reasons.
The evidence presented in this section is supplemental, not definitive. Still, it is
consistent with the notion of a reciprocal political channel that steers mortgage growth after the
TARP towards areas within the district borders of the bank’s congressional representative. 49

7. Conclusion
This paper has documented the existence of a “home-district effect”; banks that received
capital from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) lent 23%-60% more in their homerepresentative’s congressional district than elsewhere. To our knowledge, this is among the first
evidence that political considerations influence banks’ mortgage and small business lending
decisions in the United States, despite the maturity of the American political and financial
systems and the absence of formal possibilities for politicians to influence bank lending
decisions. Of course, we do not know whether our result is general, or an idiosyncratic result of
an exceptional financial intervention during a financial crisis. Changes in key regulations may
constitute insightful laboratories for further research.
31

From a policy perspective, our results bear on discussions around newly created crossborder bank funding and resolution arrangements such as the European Stability Mechanism
(ESM). Our results suggest that conflicting local interests may steer the impact of bailout
programs, even in areas as politically and financially integrated as the United States. This
suggests that international mechanisms may find it even more difficult to mute conflicting
national interests over bailouts and the associated impact on credit supply.

This table reports results of the stage-0 (columns 1 and 4) and stage-1 (columns (2-3 and 5-6) of the three-stage
least square model whose stage 2 is presented in Table 1 (columns 2-3). Stage-0 is a cross-sectional bank-level
probit regression of participation in TARP conditional on an exogenous instrument and bank controls (2008
values). I(TARP) is 1 if bank b is a TARP recipient. Fed director is 1 if a member of b’s board is or was a
member of a Federal Reserve Bank, and 0 otherwise. Subcommittee member is 1 if b’s home district
representative is member of the House sub-committee for financial affairs in 2008, and 0 otherwise. Robust,
non-clustered standard errors in parentheses (* p<0.05, ** p<.01). Stage 1 is the usual first stage of a 2SLS
model. It regresses the bank-county-year-level endogenous variables TARP and TARP x Home against
� is the fitted value of TARP participation obtained from
instruments obtained from Stage 0. Specifically, 𝑇𝐴𝑅𝑃
�
Stage 0 after 2008, and 0 otherwise. Home x 𝑇𝐴𝑅𝑃 is the fitted value of TARP participation obtained from
Stage 0 after 2008 and if county c is inside b’s home congressional district, and 0 otherwise. The sample covers
the 2006-2010 period, and includes all loans given out in census tracts adjacent to a within-state congressional
district border. All US commercial banks active as of 2008q3 are included. Regressions also include bank-year
controls as of 2008q3 (log total assets, tier-1 capital, cash, charge-offs, non-performing loans, repossessed real
estate, deposits, (log) bank age, return on equity and exposure to local shocks) and bank-county-borrower
controls (log income, non-white dummy, non-male dummy, tract percentage of minority population, tract
median income), as well as bank-district and county-year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered by BankHolding Company in parentheses (* p<0.05, ** p<.01).

Collusion between politicians and banks in their constituencies are also known to have played a key role behind the
historical evolution of the long regionally fragmented American banking system (Kroszner and Strahan, 1999). Rajan and
Ramcharan (2011) show that local political circumstances affected access to bank credit in early 20th Century America.
2

Tahoun and Vasvari (2016) show that members of key US Congress committees obtain bank loans at preferential terms.
While this study is also suggestive of political influences on US bank lending decisions, it does not investigate whether these
influences bind beyond individual loans to politicians.

3

More surprisingly, Liu & Ngo (2014) find that US banks failures are less likely in a year before a gubernatorial election.

In December 2008, the Chicago firm Republic Windows & Doors shut its doors, laying off 300 employees, after failing to
renegotiate an important loan with Bank of America. Speaking at a worker’s sit-in, TARP supporter Illinois Senator Dick
Durbin said: “We are going to sit down with my friends in the Senate and talk about ways to reach out to the bank, which is
receiving funds from the $700 Troubled Assets Relief Program”;

In May 2009, online media FinLaw reported that “the state of Ohio and [Ohio-based] Huntington Bancshares announced a
joint program to lend $1 billion to small businesses over the next three years. Many small businesses have waited for such
initiatives from banks like Huntington that received TARP money … As noted by the Columbus Dispatch, the initiative
seeks to bolster small business lending, which has lagged despite the infusion of federal money from the Troubled Asset
Relief Program into many banks. Huntington received $1.4 billion in TARP money”;

The contours of local banking markets do not generally coincide with congressional district borders. Mortgage lending
data for 2005 (sources are discussed in the following section) indicates that the median/average American bank originate
mortgages in 5/11.2 congressional districts, respectively. The 10th percentile bank lends in two districts, suggesting that
even small banks operate in more than one congressional district. The disconnect between banking markets and districts
seems obvious, since district maps are not primarily drawn based on economic or socio-economic homogeneity, but rather
on intrinsically political criteria, starting with the need for each district to contain a similar number of people. Further, the
allocation of congressional districts to states is changed every decade and district maps are regularly re-drawn; consequently,
the shapes of some districts change in the absence of economic changes.

In practice, we use only loans within a given county which are made in census tracts adjacent to an intrastate district
border; more on this below.

Note that Homei,c does not appear in level in the model since it is captured by the bank-home fixed effect.

19

Banks behave differently in markets closer to their headquarters since geographical proximity attenuates informational
asymmetries (Petersen and Rajan, 2002), particularly so after downturns (Giannetti and Laeven, 2014; Chavaz, 2016).
20
For robustness, we check for the possibility that TARP recipients received more unsolicited applications via county-yearTARP fixed effects.
21
Our home-district effect estimate could be biased upwards if TARP recipients receive more unsolicited applications in
their home district. It is unclear whether or not unsolicited prospective borrowers might prefer to apply with a TARP
recipient rather than with other lenders. Applicants might perceive TARP banks to have higher lending capacity due to
lower funding costs, but applicants might also be wary of the stigma attached to TARP participation, perceiving it as a signal
of underlying weakness (Berger and Roman, 2015). Either way, it seems implausible to us that this perception would prevail
only a) inside the bank’s home district and not elsewhere, and b) for borrowers with higher unobservable quality.
22

One caveat: we lack information on bank applications to the TARP. Duchin & Sosyura (2012, 2014) have collected
application information from banks’ annual reports or other communications. However, this information is only available
for public banks, which are a minority in our sample. Duchin & Sosyura (2012) find that 80.2% of eligible banks applied,
and that pre-existing connections do not correlate with application decision.
23
The only HMDA reporting exemption is for banks under a size threshold (e.g. $36 mn in 2007) and banks without a
branch in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). This means that the data covers the vast majority of mortgage lending,
excepted in a few rural areas. Data can be downloaded from the FFIEC website
(https://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/hmdaproducts.htm). The coverage is less comprehensive in the small and medium enterprise
(SME) lending dataset stemming from the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). We use this dataset as a robustness check
below.
24

We use a relatively short window (2006-2010) for the baseline estimation to diminish the problem of banks exiting TARP.
To check the importance of the window, we experiment with alternatives later on.
25

See http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Researcher/Pooling.htm. A limited number of tracts can be attributed to more than
one district; we drop loans granted in these tracts.
26
We map the bank identifier provided in HMDA into a BHC identifier using the Regulatory High Holder identifier
provided in bank Call Reports. For banks unaffiliated to a BHC, we aggregate data at the bank level.
27
Duchin & Sosyura (2014). We check for the importance of this exclusion below by including these banks in a sensitivity
check.

The remaining 47 participants do not show up for a variety of reasons, including inexistent mortgage lending (e.g.
Goldman Sachs).

Bank- and BHC-level Call Reports can be downloaded from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago website
(https://www.chicagofed.org/banking/financial-institution-reports/commercial-bank-data and
https://www.chicagofed.org/banking/financial-institution-reports/bhc-data, respectively).

32

In single-district counties, we map bank headquarters into districts using the Census Bureau relationship file. For banks
with headquarters located in counties with multiple districts, we either use the headquarters’ zip code and combine it with a
ZCTA-District and ZIP-ZCTA relationship file from the Census Bureau, or headquarters’ geographical coordinates (from
Summary of Deposits) mapped into districts using our own geo-coding routine. We drop the few banks whose headquarters
can be attributed to multiple districts.
33

We thank Lei Li for kindly sharing the data for his instrument.

34

Gerrymandering could bias our results upwards if it increases the sharpness of the discontinuity between politically
heterogeneous but economically similar areas. Alternatively, gerrymandering could bias our results downwards if abnormal
district shapes make it unlikely that a bank only maintains relationships with the representative of its home district.
35

We have also checked that the home-district effect is not statistically different for the most gerrymandered districts.

48

36
If we substitute 2007 for 2008, the IV estimates remain essentially unchanged, but the OLS and PSM estimates fall to 0.16
(0.09) and 0.16 (0.07) respectively.
37

The same is true of using bank-district fixed effects, as we did in earlier versions of the paper.

38

A minor difference is that borrower controls appear at the borrower level rather than as a bank-county-year average as in
the baseline regression. Specifically, Z includes: loan-to-income, log loan size, log income, and binary variables for
borrowers that are black, Latino and non-male. We do not include the tract-level borrower controls used in the baseline
regression since they are picked up by the tract-year fixed effects.

39

Since they vary in size and shape, a majority of census tract can be paired with multiple census tracts on the other side of
the border (2.3 on average). Thus, a given observation must be included several times in some cases for this model to be
identified; specifically, applications must appear once for each possible pair they can be attributed to. For instance, an
application from a tract that can be matched to three different tracts on the other side of the border must be included three
times in the dataset.
40

This also allows us to focus on applications for which banks have the greatest margin of discretion. In particular, GSE
loans are typically underwritten automatically using the GSEs’ own software and standardized data, leaving little discretion
for alternative considerations (such as political ones) to be factored into screening decisions. Refinancing loans also leave
less discretion to banks, since the ability to observe the applicant’s payment history reduces contracting frictions (Gilje et al.,
2016).
41

Since non-linear models are biased in the presence of high-dimensional fixed effects, we estimate the PSM model via OLS
(Puri et al. 2011; Duchin & Sosyura, 2014).

Column 1 in appendix Table 5 establishes this result more formally using interaction terms instead of sub-samples.

44

We establish this non-result more formally using interactions terms in the second column of appendix Table A2.

45

A ‘no’ vote for the AHRFPA does not necessarily mean that the representative does not cater to constituent interests
altogether. It may also reflect constraints linked to party discipline or ideology (Mian et al. 2010).
46

Since less than five weeks separated the passage of TARP from the general election, it seems reasonable to rule out
reverse causality, whereby more home-district lending by TARP recipients would facilitate a representative’s re-election.
47

In contrast, the EESA vote does not correlate with mortgage defaults in the representative’s district.

48

Column 3 in appendix Table 5 shows that this result also holds (at the 5% level) for a subsample of banks whose
representative supported the EESA. In other words, political contributions also matter independently of their effect on the
EESA vote.
49
We can only speculate about the precise nature of this linkage. However, these results do not necessarily require or
suggest active involvement from representatives. Political tensions around bank lending, coupled with a representative’s
enhanced potential leverage on banks may be enough to influence bank investment, whether intentionally or not.
