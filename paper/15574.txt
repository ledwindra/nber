ABSTRACT
For decades, the US public and private sectors have committed substantial resources towards cancer
research, but the societal payoff has not been well-understood. We quantify the value of recent gains
in cancer survival, and analyze the distribution of value among various stakeholders. Between 1988
and 2000, life expectancy for cancer patients increased by roughly four years, and the average willingness-to-pay
for these survival gains was roughly $322,000. Improvements in cancer survival during this period
created 23 million additional life-years and roughly $1.9 trillion of additional social value, implying
that the average life-year was worth approximately $82,000 to its recipient. Health care providers
and pharmaceutical companies appropriated 5-19% of this total, with the rest accruing to patients.
The share of value flowing to patients has been rising over time. These calculations suggest that from
the patient's point of view, the rate of return to R&D investments against cancer has been substantial.

"I will also ask for an appropriation of an extra $100 million to launch an
intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer, and I will ask later for whatever
additional funds can effectively be used. The time has come in America when the
same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and took man to the moon
should be turned toward conquering this dreaded disease. Let us make a total
national commitment to achieve this goal."1
--President Richard M. Nixon, January 1971 State of the Union Address

Eleven months later, President Nixon formalized the war on cancer with the passage of
the National Cancer Act, an act designed to promote the discovery of new treatments for cancer
and to encourage early detection and prevention of the disease. More than three decades later,
cancer remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In 2003
alone, cancer represented the second leading cause of mortality in the US, accounting for nearly
25% of all deaths, or roughly 556,000.2 Today, nearly 1.5 million cases of cancer are diagnosed
in the US annually.
While cancer continues to claim lives, the last three decades have witnessed tremendous
strides in our understanding and treatment of the disease. Scientists have identified many of the
genes responsible for cancer, discovered new chemotherapeutic and biologic approaches to
treating the disease, and developed new imaging techniques to detect cancer earlier.
Accompanying these scientific advances have been perhaps equally important public health
campaigns which have led to improved screening and earlier detection of the disease.

Moreover, the number of deaths from cancer has been increasing, owing in large part to advances in technology
that have reduced the probability of dying from heart disease (Honore and Lleras-Muney, 2006).

Despite these advances, there is significant debate over whether the war on cancer is being
“won.” Criticisms generally center on two closely related issues. The first is that there has been
little progress in cancer survival, and that the progress that has been made is due to the
development of expensive treatments that marginally prolong life (Epstein, 2005; Faguet, 2005).
Indeed, a large body of work has questioned the cost-effectiveness of recent cancer treatments
(Berenson, 2005; Hillner and Smith, 2007; Kolata and Pollack, 2008; Shih and Halpern, 2008).
This has influenced public opinion among physicians as well. For example, a recent survey of
academic oncologists found that only 25% of those surveyed believe that recently developed
therapies for metastatic colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers offer a good value (Nadler et
al., 2006). Second, some argue that too much effort has been focused on developing such costly
treatments, at the expense of prevention and early detection (Faguet, 2005). In response to both
criticisms, proponents of the war on cancer argue that there have been substantial increases in
cancer survival. For example, the five-year relative survival rate for all cancers diagnosed
between 1996 and 2003 was 66%, up from 50% in the mid-1970s (American Cancer Society,
2008).3 Improvements in survival have been particularly dramatic for breast cancer, colon
cancer, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, all of which have seen significant advances in therapy,
screening, or both (Breen et al., 2001; Espey et al., 2007; Pulte et al., 2008). Despite this
controversy, there has been little effort to explicitly analyze the benefits and costs of the war on
cancer. The sole exception we are aware of is Lichtenberg (2004), who estimates that newer
cancer drugs developed between 1975 and 1995 increased the life expectancy of a cancer patient
by one year and increased the cost of cancer care by $3,000 per patient.
3

For cancer survival, epidemiologists often estimate a relative survival rate, which is the survival of cancer patients
compared to a health control group. This measure is useful because it controls for survival gains from other diseases
besides cancer. The absolute survival rate has increased dramatically as well. For example, from 1950 to 1995, the
absolute five-year survival rate increased from: 1% to 4% for pancreatic cancer, 41% to 62% for colon cancer, 60%
to 86% for breast cancer, 72% to 86% for uterine cancer, and 43% to 93% for prostate cancer (Welch et al., 2000).

4

To address this important question, our paper evaluates the costs and benefits of
investments in R&D that began with the War on Cancer. We also evaluate the distribution of net
social gains across patients and firms. Gains in cancer R&D will affect cancer survival through
three mechanisms.

First, R&D advances may prevent the disease altogether, through the

development of vaccines, changes in behavior, and the development of screening tests to identify
pre-malignant disease. Second, technological advances or efforts to increase screening may
result in the detection of malignant disease at earlier stages. This may improve survival, since
cancer is typically easier to treat at earlier stages. Finally, therapeutic advances may improve
survival directly. For example, better treatment for late-stage cancer can improve survival even
if detection remains unchanged.
In prior work (Sun et al., 2008), we calculated cancer survival gains between 1988 and
2000 and decomposed these into the shares accounted for by treatment and detection
improvements, respectively. Overall, we found that cancer survival increased significantly—for
instance, survival for all cancers combined increased by 3.9 years between 1988 and 2000, while
survival for breast cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma increased by 3.6 and 3.5 years,
respectively.

The majority of these gains were due to improvements in treatment, which

accounted for roughly 80% of survival gains for both breast cancer alone and for all cancers
combined, and for nearly all of the survival gains for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In particular,
we found that changes in the probability of early detection were much less quantitatively
significant than improvements in survival at a given stage of the disease.
The earlier analysis focused on the relative contributions of detection and treatment to
survival. In this study, we compare the social value of these survival gains to their cost, to gain
some insight into the social welfare effects of the war on cancer. Moreover, there continues to be

5

contention over how much producers and manufacturers earn, and whether this comes at the
expense of consumer surplus for patients. Therefore, we also ask how these social gains (or
costs) were shared between patients and producers. A program that generated gains in social
surplus that flowed exclusively, or primarily, to producers, would be viewed quite differently by
policymakers and the public, compared to one that generated gains for patients.
We quantify the costs and benefits of cancer R&D, focusing on the benefits of earlier
detection of malignant disease and improved cancer therapies. We begin by calculating the
value of improved cancer survival from 1988 to 2000. We calculate that the average newly
diagnosed cancer patient, earning the average US income, would be willing to pay approximately
$31,000 annually to retain year 2000 survival prospects, as compared with the prospects
available in 1988. This is equal to roughly half of full income. The high rates of mortality
associated with cancer magnify the value of even small absolute survival gains, since greater
value is placed on a given gain in longevity, when an individual has a shorter life expectancy
(Becker et al., 2007). For example, since the value of consumption and wealth are significantly
lower after death, individuals may be willing to pay nearly their entire end-of-life wealth for as
little as a few extra weeks of life. In fact, this is one explanation for the emergence of expensive
biologic treatments for cancer, which increase life-expectancy quite modestly – in some cases,
just weeks -- and yet still face high demand (Goldman et al., 2009). In addition, our results also
suggest that wealthier individuals would be willing to pay a larger share of their income for these
higher survival prospects. In economic parlance, this implies that cancer treatment behaves like
a “luxury good,” in the sense that expenditure shares rise with income.
Aggregating over patients, we estimate that these improvements in survival generated
approximately 23 million additional life-years, and $1.9 trillion of value for patients. These

6

numbers imply that cancer patients were willing to pay $86,000 for the average life-year gained.
This is well within the range of conventional estimates for the value of a statistical life-year, as
we note.
We compare this total benefit of survival gains with the cost of achieving those gains –
defined as aggregate spending on cancer treatment, plus research and development costs. We
count only those benefits that accrue from 1988 to 2000, well after R&D initiated in the early
1970s would come to fruition. Against these benefits, we counted the total cost of (and profits
from) cancer care provided from 1988 to 2000, and all cancer R&D spending from 1970 to 2000.
Using these inputs, we calculate that cancer care providers (drug companies, hospitals, doctors,
and health professionals) earned at most $433 billion in profits over this time period, while the
net surplus to patients was approximately $1.5 trillion.
We are deliberately conservative in our approach to estimating the rate of return earned
by the war on cancer. First, we do not incorporate the value generated by cancer prevention, and
count only the benefits that accrue to individuals who acquire cancer. Second, while we count
all cancer R&D expenditures from 1970 onwards as the total size of investment, we count net
benefits (gains in survival, less medical costs) from 1988 to 2000 only. We restrict our analysis
partly due to limitations present in data for earlier years, but also to recognize the lags inherent in
the medical R&D cycle. For instance, it would be inappropriate to count benefits that accrue
from therapies developed prior to 1970. Typically, drug development takes 10 to 15 years from
inception to launch (DiMasi et al., 2003); enforcing an 18-year lag thus seems a conservative
assumption. Moreover, we also over-count R&D costs by including some spending – towards
the late 1990s, for instance – whose benefit has not yet been realized or measured.

7

This paper is outlined as follows. Section I describes our framework for valuing gains in
cancer survival. Section II explains the data and methods we use to estimate the value of gains
in cancer survival in the US between 1988 and 2000, as well as the methods we use to estimate
the costs of cancer care and R&D during this period. Section III presents our results, and section
IV concludes.

I. FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING THE WAR ON CANCER
Our analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we estimate the value to individuals of gains in
cancer survival. Second, we decompose these gains into those accounted for by improved
treatment and earlier detection. Finally, we estimate the aggregate social value of cancer gains,
compare these to costs, and examine the distribution of gains across patients and producers. This
section describes, in that order, the framework we use to answer each of these questions.
Valuing Gains in Cancer Survival
Our framework for valuing gains in cancer survival is based on the approach utilized by Becker,
Philipson, and Soares (2005).

These authors derive valuation formulas for infra-marginal

changes in longevity.4 It is important to think of cancer survival changes as infra-marginal,
because the alternative to treatment is often rapid mortality, not slight increments in mortality
risk. Indeed, infra-marginal valuation should ideally be the standard approach to estimating the
value of discrete survival gains from any disease. Changes in health-related mortality risk seem
poorly matched to natural experiments that estimate the willingness-to-pay for marginal risk
reduction.

4

This infra-marginal valuation approach has also been used to value improvements in HIV/AIDS survival
(Philipson and Jena, 2006) and to calculate the general equilibrium effects of large improvements in mortality (Jena,
Mulligan, Philipson, and Sun, 2008).

8

Following Becker, Philipson, and Soares, we consider a hypothetical life-cycle individual
(HLCI) whose disease begins in a given year and who faces that year’s cross-sectional survival
and annual income for the remainder of his or her life. The cross-sectional survival is assumed
to reflect the detection and treatment technologies available at that time. In order to calculate the
individual value of improved cancer survival in that year, we ask how much a HLCI contracting
cancer would be willing to pay to avoid the less favorable survival curves from the earlier year.
This amount represents the patient’s willingness-to-pay for the improved survival probabilities.
We can then do this separately for the increment in survival generated by better treatment and
better detection.

{ } represent the vector of survival probabilities, based on the available

Let S t = Si,t j

treatment technology present in year t. Si,t j represents the probability that the patient survives at
least j years after the disease has begun in year t, given that the disease is detected at stage i. For
1980
example, S early
, j is the probability that an individual who gets cancer in 1980 and is diagnosed

1980
early will live at least j years past 1980. Equivalently, S late
, j is the probability that an individual

who gets cancer in 1980 and is ultimately diagnosed late will live at least j years from 1980.
Note that in this example, 1980 is the date of incidence, as opposed to the date of detection. For
notational simplicity, we omit the superscript t where possible, with the understanding that
survival profiles generally vary over time.
We can capture the salient features of the problem by supposing that an individual’s
survival profile depends on when his disease gets detected, and the survival probabilities of
cancer patients diagnosed at various stages. Define p as the probability of early detection.
Define S as a vector of survival probabilities for various stages of diagnosis. Finally, define

9

lifetime full-income as Y . The individual’s indirect utility then depends on these three “goods,”
according to v ( p, S , Y ) .

In a simple environment with a single consumption good, a complete contingent claims
market, and an interest rate equal to the individual’s rate of discount, consumption profiles will
be constant. Therefore, if y represents an individual’s full income in a single period, it will be
the case that consumption c = y in each period. As a result, indirect utility can be represented
as:
V ( p, S , y ) = u( y ) ⋅ ∑ pi A( Si )

(1)

i
∞

1
S , which is the expected value of an annuity paying one unit of
j i, j
j = 0 (1 + r )

Here, A( Si ) = ∑

consumption each year to an individual with the survival profile defined by Si , j .
Once we quantify V ( p, S , y ) , we can define the willingness to pay for arbitrary
increments in survival and detection. In particular, an individual currently enjoying p' and S ' is
willing to pay wtp to avoid having to face p and S , where:
V ( p ' , S ' , y − wtp ) = V ( p, S , y )

(2)

This equation provides us with the conceptual means to calculate the value to patients of changes
in survival and detection probabilities.

Valuing Improvements in Treatment and Detection

Gains in cancer survival may be driven by advances in both treatment and detection. Advances
in treatment, such as the development of new chemotherapeutic regimens or surgical techniques,
improve survival by delaying progression of the disease or eliminating it outright. Improvements

10

in detection, which can occur through the development of new technologies and/or public health
efforts to increase screening, improve survival by allowing more patients to be diagnosed, and
therefore treated, earlier.

Given the potential importance of each of these mechanisms in

accounting for overall gains in survival, it is useful to decompose the overall willingness-to-pay
for survival improvements into the portion due to treatment versus detection.
Equation 2 characterizes the individual’s willingness-to-pay for a bundle of detection and
survival probabilities. Analogous to the well-known Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition in labor
economics (Blinder, 1973; Oaxaca, 1973), we can decompose the total change in value into the
component driven by changes in detection probabilities, holding survival profiles constant, and
the remaining component driven by changes in survival profiles alone. Specifically, we can
write:
ΔV = V ( p ' , S ' , y ) − V ( p , S , y )

= [V ( p ' , S ' , y ) − V ( p ' , S , y )] + [V ( p ' , S , y ) − V ( p, S , y )]

(3)

= ΔVtreat + ΔVdetect

The first term in square brackets is the increase in lifetime indirect utility due to improvements in
treatment: this is defined as changes in the survival profile, holding the probability of early
detection constant. The second is the increase in utility due to improvements in detection:
analogously, this is defined as changes in the probability of early detection, holding survival
profiles constant. If we were quantifying marginal changes in utility, dV , their monetary values
would be approximately equal to

dV

λ

, where λ is the marginal utility of income. Since we are

quantifying infra-marginal changes ΔV , the analogous approach is to divide by the average
utility of income, M . This is defined in terms of the individual’s willingness-to-pay and utility
change, as in:

ΔV

(5)

M ≡

Dividing both sides of (3) by (4):
wtp =

The first term is the approximate monetary value of detection gains and the second the
approximate value of treatment gains.

These are approximations, because each change in

lifetime indirect utility is divided by the average utility of income, calculated across the entire
improvement in survival, not just the specific portion due to detection or to treatment.
Estimating Aggregate Consumer Surplus from Improvements in Cancer Survival

Equation (2) allows us to calculate the annual amount an individual is willing to pay for a given
improvement in cancer survival from a baseline year t to year t’.

We define this annual

willingness to pay as wtpt,t’. The lifetime willingness to pay, WTPt,t’, for the improved survival is
the expected present value of the stream of these annual willingness to pay terms:
WTP t , t ' = wtp t , t ' ⋅ ∑ pi' A( S i' )

(6)

i

The individual’s lifetime consumer surplus from gains in survival equals this lifetime
willingness-to-pay, net of lifetime spending on cancer. Expected lifetime spending for a patient
whose disease begins in year t can be defined as C t , where:
∞

Sit, j
c tj
j
j = 0 (1 + r )

C t ≡ ∑ pit ∑
i

(7)

In this expression, ctj is the average cost (across all disease stages) j years after cancer strikes.
The net cost of moving to year t ' technology from year t technology is thus C t ' − C t . As a
result, the individual’s lifetime consumer surplus from this movement in technology can be
represented as:
12

cs t ,t ' = WTPt , t ' − (C t ' − C t )

(8)

Using individual consumer surplus values, we can then aggregate up to total consumer
surplus. Since the willingness to pay for survival gains, and therefore consumer surplus, is a
function of income in our model, the total consumer surplus accruing to a cohort of cancer
patients whose disease begins in a given year t ' , CS t ' , can be calculated by integrating over the
income distribution and multiplying by the incidence of cancer in that year, N t ' :
CS t ' = N t ' ∫ cs t , t ' ( y ) f ( y )dy

(9)

In this expression, cs t , t ' ( y ) is the consumer surplus for a patient with income y; f ( y ) is the
distribution of income, and N t ' is the number of patients whose disease begins in the year t ' .
The aggregate consumer surplus across all cohorts ever afflicted with cancer is the present
discounted sum of the consumer surplus accruing to each cohort:
CS t '
t '−t
t ' ≥ t (1 + r )

CS = ∑

(10)

II. DATA AND METHODS

In the previous section, we outlined a theoretical framework for calculating the consumer surplus
arising from gains in cancer survival and estimating the relative contributions of advances in
cancer treatment and detection.

Implementing our approach requires several pieces of

information, including: (1) assumptions about the nature of the utility function, (2) estimates of
stage-conditional survival and detection probabilities, (3) estimates of the income distribution,
and (4) historical estimates of cancer spending. The following sections describe, in this order,
how we incorporate each of these elements into our analysis.

13

Parameterizing the Willingness to Pay

Following Becker, Philipson, and Soares (2005), we assume that the instantaneous utility
function takes the following form:
u(c ) =

c1− (1 / γ )
+α
1 − (1/ γ )

(11)

The parameter α is a normalization factor that determines the level of consumption at which the
individual would be indifferent between life or death (at which point utility equals zero), and γ is
the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. Following these authors, we assume that γ = 1.25
and α = −14.97 .5 Given expressions (2) and (11), it is straightforward to show that the closedform solution for the willingness to pay for an improvement in detection and treatment prospects
from year t to t’ is:

Estimates of Survival and Detection Probabilities

Our estimates of survival and detection probabilities are drawn from prior work (Sun et al.,
2008), which we briefly summarize here. In that analysis, we use data from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to estimate changes in cancer survival and
detection between 1988 and 2000. SEER is a database of reports from 17 cancer registries,
maintained by the National Cancer Institute, which has tracked cancer incidence since 1973. We
restricted our focus to tumors from the nine original SEER registries present in 1973, which
cover roughly 10% of the US population. When an individual living in an area covered by a
registry is diagnosed with cancer, a report is sent to SEER describing that individual’s age at
5

For further justification of these parameter assumptions, please see Becker, Philipson, and Soares (2005).

14

diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and gender. In addition, SEER collects data about the tumor itself,
including its location and stage at diagnosis. Once diagnosed, patients are (generally) actively
followed up until they die or are otherwise lost to follow-up. For each patient, SEER then
reports the number of years for which the patient was known to be alive, as well as the patient’s
status at the end of that time (death or lost to follow-up).
We focused our analysis on all cancers combined, as well as the following individual
cancers: breast, colorectal, lung, pancreas, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. SEER data provide
four classifications for stage: in situ, localized, regional metastasis, and distal metastasis.
Because the proportion of patients diagnosed with in situ cancer was relatively small for most of
the cancers we examined, we combined the in-situ and localized stages. We thus modeled
breast, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers as proceeding through three stages: in
situ/localized, regional metastasis, and distal metastasis. For non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and all
cancers combined, differences in coding across cancers and years required us to model disease in
two stages: a late stage comprising of distal metastasis and an early stage consisting of all other
stages combined.
While further details of the methodology used to estimate survival and detection
probabilities can be found in our complementary analysis, two points should be stressed. First,
we took a period (cross-sectional) approach to estimating survival, rather than a cohort
(longitudinal) approach. Formally, the period probability, in year t of surviving from year 5 to
year 6, is calculated as the fraction of patients acquiring the disease in year t-6 who survived
from year t-1 to year t. The cohort approach, on the other hand, would calculate this probability
as the fraction of people acquiring the disease in year t who survived from year t+5 to year t+6.

15

We employ the period approach for two reasons. First, it facilitates calculation of longterm survival probabilities, which are necessary to calculate accurate estimates of life
expectancy.6 Second, the period approach to calculating survival probabilities in year t reflects
the state of year t technology. The cohort-based approach, on the other hand, amalgamates
technology across all years during which the cohort will live. Of course, the period approach
limits the number of years available to us: for instance, to calculate the 1988 probability of
surviving 6 years, we will need to observe patients who entered the registry in 1982. While
SEER data were collected beginning in 1973, reliable data on staging were only available for
many cancers starting in 1982. While we could therefore begin our analysis with cancers starting
in 1983, as mentioned above, the period approach limits the number of years available to us for
earlier years. As a result, we focused our efforts on survival gains between 1988 and 2000; doing
so allows us to estimate survival for patients in 1988 for up to six years using the SEER data
directly. Since about half of cancer patients survived six years in 1988, we viewed this as the
minimum acceptable panel length for our first year of analysis.
Second, we used all-cause mortality to estimate survival, as opposed to disease-specific
mortality. All-cause mortality is sensitive to gains from treatment of competing risks for cancer,
and it avoids issues associated with cause-of-death misattribution (Moy et al., 2001; Black et al.,
2002). One drawback of using all-cause mortality, however, is the possibility of capturing
secular improvements in mortality that have little to do with improvements in cancer treatment or
detection. As a result, we assessed the sensitivity of our results by re-estimating consumer
surplus values using cancer-specific mortality. Our results are largely unchanged, and perhaps
even suggest larger gains in mortality.
6

For example, for patients who were diagnosed with cancer in 2000, the probability of surviving 20 years is
estimated using the data from patients who were initially diagnosed in 1980. By contrast, the cohort-based approach
would require following patients whose disease began in 2000 until 2020.

16

Important to our analysis, SEER data report survival from the date of diagnosis, not the
date of incidence. This can result in “lead-time bias” in our estimates of survival because
individuals who are detected earlier may appear to live longer, even if earlier detection provides
no therapeutic benefit. If the transition time between stages of the disease is known, survival
from the date of incidence can be estimated as the observed survival from the date of diagnosis at
a given stage plus the average transition time from incidence to that stage. For example, if the
observed post-diagnosis survival for a given cancer is 5 years for individuals with regional
disease, and it is known that it takes two years for the cancer to progress from in situ/local
disease to regional disease, then the estimated survival from date of incidence would be seven
years. Note that for this estimation strategy to deliver reliable estimates of survival after cancer
incidence, the transition times between stages must be calculated in the absence of treatment.
Such transition times may, of course, be difficult to observe in actual practice. To deal with this
issue, we examine the sensitivity of our results to lead time bias by subjecting the estimation to a
range of transition time assumptions, from: (a) for in situ/local patients, the date of diagnosis and
the date of incidence are the same, to (b) for later stage patients, the disease takes on a range of
transition times of up to three years between each stage. For diseases with three stages such as
breast, colon, pancreatic, and lung cancer, this amounted to an assumed six-year transition time
between early and late disease.7 We report baseline results assuming no transition time between
stages, and then show how our results vary with different transition time assumptions. Our
qualitative conclusions for value, net benefit, and the distribution of gains are all quite insensitive
to transition times between stages.
Estimates of Income

7

As we discuss in the next section, these ranges were chosen because they fit the available literature on transition
times between cancer stages.

17

We used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative survey of
the US civilian population, to estimate the income distribution for US cancer patients in 2000.8
We dropped respondents with negative or zero personal income. Note that MEPS only reports
earned income, while full income, which reflects the value of leisure time, is the relevant
measure. Following Murphy and Topel (2006), we assume that (full-time employed) individuals
work 2000 hours annually and have 4000 hours available annually for work and leisure, so that
full income is equal to twice earned income. While there are other data sources with higherquality income data, MEPS permits us to identify the income distribution for cancer patients
specifically.9 In figure 1 below, we plot the year 2000 cumulative distribution of full income for
cancer patients and the general population, using US Census data to calculate the latter.
Generally, cancer patients are wealthier than the general population; the median full income for a
cancer patient is $54,756 (in year 2006 dollars), compared to $49,842 in the general population.
However, Figure 1 does suggest that the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the general
population crosses the cdf for the cancer population, so that at the tail end of the distribution,
cancer patients are poorer.

8

We used the “total person-level” income variable (TTLP00X), which is the sum of all personal income except
taxes and sales income, as a measure of individual income. For retirees, income is the sum of wages, pension
payments, transfer payments, and income from investments.
9
In sensitivity analyses, we used the Current Population Survey (CPS) income distributions for the entire US
population. As shown in Appendix Table A.2, the results were qualitatively similar.

Estimates of Cancer Spending

In order to estimate consumer surplus, we must estimate Ct, the expected lifetime spending of an

t.

Recall

that

c tj , where ctj is the average cost (across all disease stages) j years after

cancer strikes. Because direct estimates of c tj are not available, we estimate lifecycle cancer
spending as follows.
First, we adopt a cross-sectional approach to estimating spending, so that spending in the
20th year of the disease for patients whose disease began in 2000 is estimated by the year 2000

19

spending of patients whose disease initially began in 1980.

In this case, the following

relationship holds:
E t = ∑ N tj c tj

(13)

j ≤t

Et represents total spending on cancer in year t and N tj is the number of patients whose disease

began j years ago, and who are alive in year t. Finally, ctj is spending by these individuals in
year t. N tj can be estimated using SEER data, which tracks patients over time. Additionally,
Brown et al. (2001) find that historically, national expenditures on cancer equal 5% of total
health expenditures, so we estimate Et to be 5% of national health expenditures.10
Even with these assumptions, more structure is needed to identify ctj . We assume that
that the share of total lifetime spending that is spent in each year of the disease remains constant
over time, so that spending in any given year of the disease is a fixed multiple of spending in the
initial year of the disease. Mathematically, this implies that:
c tj = α j cot

(14)

where cot is cancer spending in the first year of disease for someone who gets cancer in year t
and α j >1 is the proportion by which spending j years later is greater than initial spending. α j is
assumed to be independent of the year an individual gets cancer. We estimate α j using data
from the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (MEPS), which provides data on whether a patient
has ever had cancer, the year the disease began, and medical spending in the current year.
Because MEPS has relatively few cancer patients, we pooled all cancer patients between 1996
and 2004, resulting in a sample of 4,314 individuals who have had cancer for an average of 4.5
10

National health expenditure data are obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

20

years.11 Using this sample, we estimate spending on cancer care for each individual as their
medical spending in a given year minus the average spending for non-cancer patients of the same
age and gender. These estimates of cancer spending, as well as the number of years the
individual reports having cancer, are then used to estimate α j .12 With estimates of α j , Et, and
~
N tj , expressions (13) and (14) can be used to directly solve for the entire sequence of c tj . This,

in turn, allows us to calculate lifetime spending on cancer by year of cancer incidence.
Intuitively, information on incidence, survival, and the relative growth in spending from the date
of incidence, allow us to construct a time-series for medical spending.13
III. RESULTS

Increases in Cancer Detection and Survival after Treatment
Table 1 shows changes in life expectancy and the probability of early detection between 1988
and 2000 for all cancers combined, as well as the individual tumor types of breast cancer,
colorectal cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. (Note that the
“all cancers combined” group also includes tumor types not individually reported in the table,
such as prostate cancer.)

For all cancers combined, we find that overall life expectancy

increased by 3.9 years between 1988 and 2002, driven predominantly by increases in life
expectancy for early stage patients (3.7 years). Indeed, nearly all of the cancers we examined
had increases in survival at earlier disease stages, with generally little improvement in survival
11

MEPS does not contain patients who were institutionalized or hospitalized patients at the time of the survey,
which may cause us to underestimate costs. However, note that we use MEPS to estimate the distribution of costs
over the life cycle, as opposed to the total level of cancer costs, so this omission will only affect us to the degree that
it is not evenly distributed across the cancer lifecycle, and even then, would only affect our estimate of how costs are
distributed across the lifecycle, not the total level of costs.
12
In estimating cancer spending, we inflated all dollar values to year 2006 dollars. In addition, we used a sixth
order polynomial regression to smooth out and extrapolate values of

αj.

13

As a sensitivity analysis, we considered an alternate specification in which we also considered spending in the
year prior to diagnosis, using data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Our results suggested a smaller
increase in cancer spending (and therefore greater increase in consumer surplus) than the results we report here.

21

for patients who were diagnosed at distal metastasis. However, one notable exception is nonHodgkin’s lymphoma, where survival gains for distal metastasis (3.4 years) were on the same
order as gains for early stage disease (3.3 years).
Breast cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma also saw reasonably large increases in the
percentage of patients diagnosed at earlier stages. Between 1988 and 2000, the percentage of
breast cancer patients diagnosed at the in situ/localized stage increased by 8.1%, and the number
of patients diagnosed at an early stage for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma increased by 4.1%. For all
cancers combined, the percentage of patients diagnosed with early stage disease increased by
5.6%. By contrast, the remaining cancers we studied (colorectal, lung and pancreatic) saw more
modest increases in the percentage of patients diagnosed at earlier stages. Note that, due to
limitations in the staging data for prostate cancer, the SEER data do not admit analysis of
improvements in prostate cancer detection, which is commonly thought to have played a
relatively large role in survival for that disease.14

Individual Value of Cancer Survival Gains
Given our estimates of survival and detection probabilities, we can use the methodology
described earlier to calibrate the value of cancer survival gains between 1988 and 2000. For
each cancer in our analysis and for all cancers combined, Table 2 presents a number of metrics
for the value consumers place on the survival gains observed between 1988 and 2000: (1)
Annual willingness to pay, in each year of their remaining life; (2) Cumulative lifetime
willingness to pay; and (3) The implied value of a statistical life-year, calculated by dividing
cumulative willingness-to-pay for improved survival, by the observed increase in life expectancy
drawn from Table 1.

Notes: All Amounts are in Year 2006 dollars, discounted to 1990 at a 3% rate. The annual value of survival gains is
an individual’s annual willingness to pay, in each year of her remaining life, for observed survival improvements.
The lifetime value of survival gains is calculated by multiplying the annual value by the total discounted life
expectancy. The implied value of a life year is calculated by dividing the lifetime value of survival gains by the
increase in life expectancy.

Overall, our results suggest that survival gains between 1988 and 2000 were of tremendous value
to individuals with cancer. For all cancers combined, patients whose disease began in 2000 were
willing to pay an average of $293,319 (or $27,961 annually) in order to avoid the less favorable
survival and detection probabilities of 1988.

Given the estimated improvement in life

expectancy, this reflects a value of a statistical life year of roughly $75,210. Breast cancer
23

patients were willing to pay roughly $25,000 annually for survival gains, while colon cancer
patients were willing to pay roughly $18,000 annually. Intriguingly, the largest values were for
lung cancer patients ($34,368), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients ($30,759 annually), and
pancreatic cancer patients ($40,644 annually). For non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a large value is
not particularly surprising, given that survival increased by at least 3.5 years over this period.
Overall, our estimates suggests that patients’ willingness to pay for cancer survival
improvements between 1988 and 2000 imply a value of a statistical life year of roughly $75,000
for most cancers, although in the case of pancreatic cancer, the implied value of a life year is
roughly $50,000.
In Table 2, we estimated the value of cancer survival gains using the calibrated model of
lifetime utility discussed in section II. An alternative method for estimating the value of cancer
survival improvements would be to multiply the estimated gains in life expectancy by an
assumed value of a statistical life year. Commonly used values of a statistical life year vary
widely. At the lower end, $50,000 per year is the cost-effectiveness threshold used by many
public (Devlin and Parkin, 2004). Based on a review of the literature, Cutler and Richardson
(1997) estimate a value of $100,000, and using the demand for dialysis, Lee et al. (2009)
estimate the value of a life year at $129,000. At the higher end, Murphy and Topel (2006)
estimate values between $100,000-$350,000 at various points during the life cycle, while in a
review of the literature, Aldy and Viscusi (2007) find values ranging from $300,000 to $1
million. Given this range of values, Table 3 shows the value of 1988-2000 cancer survival gains
assuming a $50,000, $100,000, or $300,000 value of a statistical life year. Using a $100,000
value of a life year leads to lifetime value of cancer survival gains similar to those shown in
Table 2, which is not surprising given the values of statistical life-year implied by our analysis.

24

At $50,000 per life year, our estimated survival gains are worth roughly $195,000 for all cancers
combined, and at $300,000 per life year, they are worth roughly $1 million.

Given an average annual full income of $66,890 in the MEPS sample, Table 2 implies
that individuals getting cancer in 2000 would be willing to pay a significant fraction of their full
income, nearly 57%, in order to avoid the less favorable technologies of 1988. In Figure 2, we
explore this point further by graphing how the calibrated willingness to pay for the observed
improvements in survival varies with income.

25

FIGURE 2 – Willingness to Pay for Survival Gains as a Share of Full Income

Notes: Results shown assume that the transition time between cancer stages is 0 years. The results with a transition
time of 1 year are extremely similar and are available from the authors upon request.

In line with table 2, our results suggest that individuals with cancer were willing to pay a
large share of their annual income for survival gains since 1988, particularly among those with
the highest levels of full income. Generally speaking, we find that survival gains have been
generally worth around 50-60% of income for all cancers combined and non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, with lower levels for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer, and much higher levels for
pancreatic cancer. Indeed, we find that in some cases, individuals with pancreatic cancer would
be willing to pay nearly 80% of their full income for survival gains.
The high willingness to pay for improved survival as a share of full income for pancreatic
cancer is at odds with the conventional wisdom, for two reasons. First, pancreatic cancer

26

survival improved by less than one year. However, theoretical work by Becker, Murphy, and
Philipson (2007) argues that terminally ill patients may place unusually high value on
incremental survival gains. The intuition behind their result relies on a familiar diminishing
returns argument. While healthy people may be willing to pay moderate amounts for modest
survival gains, terminally ill patients, who are endowed with little health, may be willing to pay
far larger amounts for similarly sized gains. Put differently, because the value of wealth at death
is zero or close to it for most individuals, the willingness to pay for even minor improvements in
longevity may be large at the end of life.15 Second, the high value of pancreatic survival may be
surprising given the low quality-of-life for such patients. However, since the value of pancreatic
cancer survival is calculated as the willingness to pay to avoid earlier technologies, the relevant
question is not the absolute quality of life for pancreatic cancer patients, but rather whether
earlier technologies were associated with marked declines in quality of life. While we are
unaware of any literature that has estimated the change in the quality of life for pancreatic cancer
patients over time, Cutler and Richardson (1997) find quality-adjusted life-years (QALY’s) for
cancer patients to be unchanged from 1970 to 1990.
Our calibrated results suggest that improved longevity may be a “luxury good” in the
sense that persons with higher income are willing to pay a larger share of their income in order to
achieve these gains. These results closely mirror work by Hall and Jones (2007). On the basis of
diminishing returns to consumption and leisure in any given year, they argue that it is more
15

One prediction of the Becker et al. analysis is that the estimated value of a statistical life year
would be quite large for very small increments in survival, as in pancreatic cancer, but our
estimates suggest that values of a life year do not differ much across cancers. This discrepancy
is largely an artifact of our calibration procedure. In our approach, wealth accumulation in our
model starts at time zero (when cancer first appears), and life expectancy with pancreatic cancer
is low. Thus, while individuals with pancreatic cancer may be willing to spend larger shares of
their remaining wealth for a given unit increase in life expectancy, the overall willingness to pay
per unit will not be higher simply because wealth is lower.
27

valuable for wealthy people to increase the total number of years in which to enjoy consumption
and leisure, rather than increasing consumption and leisure in a given year. As a result, wealthier
people are likely to place more value on survival gains, causing health to resemble the economic
definition of a “luxury” good.
Table 4 shows that the value of 1988-2000 survival gains shown in Table 2 and Figure 1
were primarily driven by advances in treatment, rather than advances in detection.
Table 4: Share of Value of Survival Gains due to Advances in Treatment, 1988-2000.

For all cancers combined, the willingness to pay for treatment advances alone comprises 97% of
the total value of cancer gains. Treatment advances have been particularly important in the case
of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and pancreatic cancer, where nearly all of the value of survival
gains is due to treatment advances. For breast and lung cancer, roughly 90% of the value of
survival gains from 1988 to 2000 appears to result from advances in treatment, while for
colorectal cancer, 75-80% of the total value of survival gains is due to the value of treatment
advances. At first glance, it may seem surprising that the gains in treatment account for such a
large percentage of the value of survival gains, given the advances in early detection shown in
Table 1. Our results suggest that the gains in treatment have been even larger. Put differently,
the gains in stage-conditional survival have been larger than the gains in survival due to the
movement of patients into earlier stages at the time of detection.

28

Individual Consumer Surplus arising from Improvements in Cancer Survival
Having calculated an individual patient’s annual willingness to pay for improvements in
survival, we now turn to the issue of lifetime consumer surplus, which requires us to calculate
the lifetime value of survival gains and the increase in expected lifetime costs. Figure 3 presents
our estimates of lifetime spending for cancer patients between 1988 and 2000.

After a sharp increase at the start of our observation period, lifetime cancer spending remained
relatively constant between 1990 and 2000, at roughly $70,000. Overall, our results suggest that

29

the lifetime cost of cancer care increased by roughly $40,000 between 1988 and 2000.16 Table 4
presents estimated lifetime costs for an individual in each cohort of patients between 1989 and
2000 as well as individual estimates of the lifetime value of observed survival gains. These are
used to calculate the individual lifetime consumer surplus for each cohort.

The first column in Table 5 presents the estimated increase in life expectancy for patients whose
disease begins in the given year, compared to patients whose disease begins in 1988. The second

column shows the increase in the lifetime costs of cancer care. Finally, the last column shows
the lifetime consumer surplus associated with the improvement in cancer survival. Between
16

Using Medicare claims data, Warren et al. (2008) estimate that between 1991 and 2002, the cost of initial cancer
treatment (treatment from two months before to twelve months after diagnosis) increased by $7,319 for lung cancer,
$5,345 for colorectal cancer, and $4,189 for breast cancer, while the cost of initial treatment for prostate cancer fell
by $196. Our estimates of the lifetime cost for all cancers combined appear larger than these findings, and may thus
be overstating the increases in cancer cost, while understating the gains in consumer surplus.

30

1989 and 2000, the average lifetime cost of cancer care was roughly $41,000 higher (averaged
across all years) compared to 1988. The lifetime cost of cancer for an individual getting cancer
in 2000 was approximately $37,000 higher. The lifetime value of cancer survival gains vastly
exceeded this increase in cost, and led to substantial consumer surplus. Indeed, we find that
lifetime consumer surplus has been rapidly increasing over time. In 1989, for example, the
average gain in consumer surplus per patient was $25,000, while in 2000, the average gain in
surplus was roughly $256,000; this implies an annual increase of 21%. This rapid increase is
generated by substantial gains in survival, accompanied by relatively little growth in the costs of
cancer care, relative to 1988 levels.

Aggregate Consumer and Producer Surpluses
Given our estimates of individual lifetime consumer surplus gains arising from improvements in
cancer survival, Table 6 presents our estimates of gains in aggregate consumer surplus, which is
simply the number of newly incident cases in a given year multiplied by the individual consumer
surplus gains reported in Table 5.

Notes: All dollar values are in 2006 dollars, discounted to 1988 at a 3% rate. Changes in life expectancy
are compared to 1988 levels.

In the aggregate, we find that patients have received tremendous value from treatment and
detection advances since 1988, with estimated total consumer surplus gained of roughly $1.9
trillion for all cancer patients whose disease began between 1989 and 2000. Table 6 also presents
estimates of gains in producer surplus.
The ranges for producer surplus represent different means by which costs of care are
translated into profits. We assume that profit margins range from the high margins enjoyed by
producers of on-patent pharmaceuticals, to the lower margins enjoyed by hospitals. For drugs,
Caves et al. (1991), Grabowski and Vernon (1992) and Berndt, Cockburn, and Griliches (1996)
estimate that producer variable costs are 20% of sales. On the other hand, Gaynor and Vogt
(2003) find that hospitals have profit margins of 25%. Consistent with these estimates, we allow
producer profits to range between 20% and 80% of sales. Since health care spending on cancer
is, of course, a combination of drug therapies, as well as physician and hospital compensation,
32

actual profit margins are likely to fall somewhere between the two bounds we use. Even with the
most generous assumptions on producer surpluses, Table 6 illustrates that while producers have
benefited from increases in cancer surplus, these gains have been small relative to the gains
experienced by cancer patients. We estimate the producer surplus to be $98-393 billion from
1988 to 2000.
The sum of producer and consumer surpluses arising from improvements in cancer
survival from 1988 to 2000 is $1.9 trillion to $2.2 trillion. In order to calculate the social surplus
arising from these gains in survival, we must deduct the amount spent on cancer R&D. There
are two challenges to estimating this quantity. First, a significant proportion of R&D comes
from pharmaceutical firms, which do not typically report R&D by disease category. Second,
ideally, we would calculate the R&D spending which produced the observed survival gains
between 1988 and 2000. However, given that biomedical research often takes time to be
translated into clinical practice, it is difficult to directly determine which part of R&D in a given
year produced these gains. For example, it is likely that some of the survival gains between 1988
and 2000 were due to research spending in earlier years, while some of the R&D spending
between 1988 and 2000 did not produce the observed survival gains during this time period.
To address these issues, we construct an upper bound on R&D spending as follows.
First, we calculate the total value of National Cancer Institute spending between 1971 and 2000,
using data on the Institute’s annual appropriations (Appendix Table A.1). After converting each
year’s appropriations to 2006 dollars using the Consumer Price Index and discounting to 1988 at
a 3% interest rate, we find that the total value of cancer R&D spending was roughly $82 billion.
Assuming that NCI spending represents 25% of all cancer R&D spending leads to an upper
bound for cancer R&D of roughly $300 billion. This estimate is likely an upper bound for two

33

reasons. First, as already discussed, it is unlikely that all spending between 1971 and 2000
contributed to the survival gains between 1988 and 2000. Second, it is likely that NCI spending
accounts for more than 25% of total cancer R&D.

For example, Jaffe (1996) finds that,

generally speaking, the federal government accounts for 35% of R&D spending. Using $300
billion as an upper bound for cancer R&D, we estimate the total social surplus of 1988-2000
survival gains to be roughly $1.6-$1.9 trillion, with 82-95% of this surplus accruing to patients
and 5-19% accruing to producers.

Sensitivity Analyses
In this section, we describe analyses used to determine the sensitivity of our results to
potential sources of bias. The first we consider is the possibility of lead time bias. Lead time
bias occurs because registry data such as SEER report survival from the date of diagnosis, not
the date of incidence. As a result, improvements in detection lead to the inclusion of patients at
earlier stages of disease. These individuals will have longer remaining life expectancy even in
the absence of any true gains in survival. For example, suppose that all cancer patients die ten
years post-incidence regardless of whether the disease is detected at the “early” (two years postincidence) or “late” (eight years post-incidence) stages.

In this case, registry data will

erroneously show that early detection leads to a six year survival improvement. Thus, lead time
bias will tend to overstate the importance of detection improvements. As the example above
shows, lead time bias can be overcome by adding the transition time between stages to the
observed survival for patients whose disease is diagnosed at later stages.

Knowledge of

transition times allows accurate calculation of the actual life expectancy from the date of
incidence, rather than the potentially misleading life expectancy from the date of diagnosis.

34

Since the transition time between incidence and diagnosis is generally unknown, we
examine the degree to which variability in the transition time impacts our findings. As discussed
earlier, we consider the range of assumptions on transition times, from zero to three years for all
of the cancers we consider except breast cancer, where we consider a transition time of zero to
two years between stages. For cancers with three designated stages, such as colon, pancreatic,
and lung cancer, this amounts to an assumed six year transition time between early and late
disease. There are two major concerns with our approach. The first is the plausibility of a sixyear transition time, in the absence of treatment, from early stage to metastatic disease. While
there are few studies that have assessed the progression of cancer in the absence of treatment, the
extant literature suggests the transition time between early stage and malignant disease is roughly
two years or less. For example, Raz et al. (2007) examined survival among 1,324 California
patients who were untreated for stage I disease due to patient refusal, death prior to surgery, or
contraindications due to risk factors, and found a median survival of 9 months. In the case of
breast cancer, Bloom et al (1962) found the median survival for stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3
breast cancer to be 47.3 months, 39.2 months, and 22 months, respectively. Based on these
numbers, the average time to transition between grades is about one year, although the staging
system used by Bloom, the Manchester system, is a clinical system that differs slightly from the
AJCC system used in SEER.17
The second issue concerns the limits of our database itself. With a six-year transition
period between early and metastatic disease, individuals whose disease begins in 2000 will not
be diagnosed at the metastatic stage until 2006—however, the last year of observation in our data
is 2003. Therefore, for our sensitivity analysis, we consider how assuming a three-year transition

Result for breast cancer assumes a 2-year transition time, in order to maintain
comparability. SEER reports breast cancer in four stages, while the other tumor types are broken
down into three stages.
Not surprisingly, survival gains between 1988 and 1997 tend to be smaller than the gain
between 1988 and 2000, although interestingly, the opposite is true for pancreatic cancer. As a
result, the value of 1988-1997 survival gains tends to be smaller than the value of 1988-2000
gains. The three-year transition time generally has modest effects on survival, with the lone
exception of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Our results suggest that taking lead time bias into
account has little effect on the estimated share of gains due to treatment, with the exception of
breast cancer, where taking lead time bias into account increases the share of gains due to
treatment from 68 to 82 percent. Willingness-to-pay also typically does not change by more than
10%, with the exception of lung cancer, where the longer transition time substantially raises the
value of survival gains. In sum, lead time bias likely has quantitatively modest impacts on our

18

Because breast cancer is modeled as a four stage disease a three year transition time between stages would lead to
nine year transition period between early and late stage disease. Therefore, for breast cancer, we assume a two year
transition time between stages, which amounts to a six year transition from early to metastatic disease.

36

results; if anything, it causes us to understate the value of survival gains, and the share of
survival accounted for by improved treatment.
“Length bias” refers to unobserved changes in tumor and/or patient characteristics, which
may lead us to overestimate survival gains, and the share of gains due to treatment.
Improvements in detection will tend to sample slower-growing tumors with more favorable
survival characteristics. This is one way in which length bias may cause a spurious increase in
survival. Changes in patient characteristics over time may also create length bias. For example,
improvements in treating other co-morbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, may result
in a healthier patient population over time.

On the other hand, reductions in background

mortality may result in an older, sicker population of incident cases. Overall, secular trends in
mortality and co-morbidity may produce length bias of indeterminate sign.
While we are unable to deal directly with unobservable changes in tumor and/or patient
characteristics, we assessed the direction and degree of this bias by evaluating changes in the
observable characteristics of cancer patients, between 1992 and 2005, using the Medicare
Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The MCBS is a nationally representative data set designed
to ascertain health status, utilization, and expenditures for the Medicare population. The sample
frame consists of aged and disabled beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part A and/or Part B,
although we use only the aged in this analysis. The MCBS attempts to interview each person
twelve times over three years, regardless of whether he or she resides in the community, a
facility, or transitions between community and facility settings. The disabled (under 65 years of
age) and the oldest-old (85 years of age or over) are over-sampled. The first round of
interviewing was conducted in 1991. Originally, the survey was a longitudinal sample with
periodic supplements and indefinite periods of participation. In 1996, the MCBS switched to a

37

rotating panel design with limited periods of participation. Each fall a new panel is introduced,
with a target sample size of 12,000 respondents, and each summer a panel is retired. The MCBS
contains detailed self-reported information, including the prevalence of various conditions.
Using the MCBS, we calculated regression-adjusted trends in co-morbidity prevalence
among incident and prevalent cancer cases among the 65+ population. We ran separate
regressions for the following conditions: diabetes, heart disease,19 high blood pressure, lung
disease, and stroke. The regressions adjust for age, sex, race, and ethnicity. The results for
incident cancer cases are shown in Table 8.

Heart disease includes patients with myocardial infarction, arteriosclerosis, and coronary heart disease.

The cells in the table report coefficients on year dummies, where 1993 is the excluded
category. Relative to 1993, there are no statistically significant trends for any of these diseases,
but power is an important consideration. The MCBS contains approximately 1000 incident
cancer cases over this entire period, and standard errors around the terminal year (2005) tend to
be in the range of 6 to 9 percentage points. Therefore, while there is little evidence to support
bias in either direction, the ability to reject the existence of bias is limited by sample sizes.

39

While the incident population is the ideal choice for this analysis, we also assessed health
trends for the prevalent population, in an effort to conserve power. It is important to note that
this analysis combines the health of the entering population, with trends in the health of cancer
patients who continue to live with the disease. With that caveat, Table 9 presents the analogous
trends for the prevalent population, clustered by individual.

Among the prevalent population, there is no significant change in heart disease, lung
disease, or stroke, but there are statistically significant (and somewhat meaningful) increases in
the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. These likely owe themselves to background growth
in these conditions over the period of analysis, due to rising obesity (Mokdad et al., 2003). We
may conclude that the population of cancer patients is becoming slightly sicker, due to higher
diabetes and hypertension.

This would lead us to understate both the size and value of

improvements in survival. However, it is important to reiterate the caveat that we cannot draw
firm conclusions for the incident population.
IV. CONCLUSION

Despite the abundant research documenting gains in cancer survival, there have been few
attempts to characterize the value of cancer R&D. We provide some evidence relevant to this
issue, by measuring the value of cancer R&D, relative to its costs. We also calculate how the
social gains from R&D have been distributed between patients and producers, and the size of the
respective roles played by improved treatment and earlier detection. Our findings suggest that
cancer R&D has led to significant gains in cancer survival, which have been large relative to the
costs incurred in their pursuit. And while some cancers have experienced larger reductions in
morbidity and mortality than others, today’s cancer patients can expect to live longer and
healthier lives than their counterparts from earlier decades; these longevity increases far
outweigh the costs of achieving them.
Across all cancers, the gains in survival have been worth around half of full income, and
even those in the bottom 10% of the income distribution would be willing to pay around 40% of
their income for the observed gains in cancer survival.20 In the aggregate, we find the value of

20

In line with work by Hall and Jones (2007), our results also suggest that cancer is a “luxury good,” in the sense
that wealthier patients are willing to devote larger shares of their income to pay for gains in cancer survival.

41

gains in cancer survival to be $1.9 trillion to date, of which 5% to 19% has been appropriated by
producers in the form of profits. To provide some context for this number, we estimate that from
1988 to 2000, cancer afflicted roughly 9.5 million Americans. Across the newly diagnosed
individuals in all these cohorts, we estimate that life expectancy increased by an average of 3.9
years per patient, compared to its 1988 level. This implies the creation of 23 million life-years.
As a result, the average life-year created was worth approximately $86,000 to its recipient.
Moreover, we find that, at most, $300 billion has been spent on cancer research, implying that
private and federal R&D efforts have enjoyed very large average returns. Our results are
consistent with earlier research valuing survival gains for other diseases experiencing substantial
improvements in mortality. For example, Philipson and Jena (2006) find that in the case of
AIDS, producers were able to appropriate approximately 5% of the social surplus arising from
innovations in HIV/AIDS medications. By comparison, we find that producers have been able to
appropriate 5-19% of the social surplus generated by cancer survival gains from 1988 to 2000.
Our analysis has focused on the average return to cancer research. This is distinct from
the return on the marginal cancer research dollar. Naturally, marginal returns will be lower than
average returns. High average returns do not imply that marginal returns exceed marginal cost.
The value of the marginal dollar on cancer research is still an open question, and one that is
worth further investigation. While the War on Cancer has, on average, paid dividends, it may be
true that the size of cancer R&D spending is too large or too small, on the margin.
It is important to note that our estimates of the aggregate value of cancer gains exclude
several significant sources of value. First, we do not account for the value of gains for patients
whose cancer occurs after 2000. Even in the absence of any further technological progress in
cancer, these patients would still benefit from technologies discovered to date; therefore, our

42

estimates will understate the total social value by excluding this group. Second, our analysis
assumes that there are no technology improvements for individuals whose cancer begins in a
given year. For example, we assume that individuals whose cancer began in 1995 face the 1995
technology for the entire course of their disease. Third, our analysis does not take into account
the potential gains from cancer prevention, whether from changes in behavior or from detection
of premalignant lesions as occurs with cervical and colorectal cancer.
Our results should be interpreted as a first effort to investigate the value of gains in
cancer survival. Future research can extend it in several directions. First, as discussed, progress
needs to be made on estimating the marginal return to cancer R&D. Second, our definition of
early-stage cancer is very broad, as it includes all individuals for whom the cancer has not
metastasized. While this limitation was driven by the data, future analyses could examine how
finer definitions of stage affect the results. Third, our limited approach towards modeling the
transition time between cancer stages could be replaced by more detailed and clinically specific
estimates. In addition, with more years of data, one could examine the sensitivity of our results
to assuming longer transition times between stages. Finally, more refined estimates of cancer
spending and R&D are useful and could impact our results, particularly if there have been trends
in the percentage of health care dollars devoted to cancer.

Notes: All Amounts are in Year 2006 dollars, discounted to 1990 at a 3% rate. The annual value of survival gains is
an individual’s annual willingness to pay, in each year of her remaining life, for observed survival improvements.
The lifetime value of survival gains is calculated by multiplying the annual value by the total discounted life
expectancy. The implied value of a life year is calculated by dividing the lifetime value of survival gains by the
increase in life expectancy.
