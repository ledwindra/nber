Tax Equivalences and their Implications
Alan J. Auerbach
NBER Working Paper No. 25158

JEL No. H20,H30
ABSTRACT
In economic analyses of the effects of tax policies, one commonly encounters discussions of the
equivalence of apparently different policies, where equivalence is defined as the policies having
the same impact on fundamental economic outcomes. These related tax policies may differ in
many respects, which give rise to conditions under which the equivalences may break down.
This paper draws out the key issues that relate to tax equivalences, using several illustrations
from important instances of such equivalences that span different areas of taxation, with many of
these illustrations relating to the taxation of capital income. Recognition of equivalences and the
ways in which they may fail to hold is important both for positive analysis (e.g., the political
reasons for choosing one approach over another) and for normative analysis (to determine which
approach may be a more effective way of implementing a policy).

I. Introduction
In economic analyses of the effects of government policies, one commonly encounters
discussions of the equivalence of apparently different policies. Perhaps most familiar is that a
tax imposed on transactions in a market should have the same impact whether it is formally
levied on the consumer or the producer.

As illustrated in Figure 1, the imposition of a unit tax at rate 𝑡𝑡 on sellers raises the supply

curve from 𝑆𝑆 to 𝑆𝑆′, whereas the same unit tax imposed on purchasers lowers the demand curve

from 𝐷𝐷 to 𝐷𝐷′. In each case, purchases fall from 𝑄𝑄0 to 𝑄𝑄1 , the tax-inclusive price paid by

purchasers rises to 𝑃𝑃2, the after-tax price received by sellers falls to 𝑃𝑃1 , and government

revenue equals 𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑄𝑄1 . The only difference between the two outcomes is that the observed

1

market price falls to 𝑃𝑃1 when the tax is paid by consumers and rises to 𝑃𝑃2 when producer pay

the tax. This simple example illustrates the central elements of a tax equivalence: the budget
constraints and economic incentives of agents and the government are unaffected, as is the
resulting equilibrium, even though market prices may differ. It follows from the equivalence

that the incidence and efficiency effects of the two tax policies are the same as well, regardless
of the behavioral elasticities of individuals and firms, because these elasticities apply equally
across different versions of the equivalent policy.
Implicit in this equivalence is the absence of real-world factors that might cause it to
break down, such as restrictions on the movement of market prices (for example, a minimum
wage or frictions that result from bargaining institutions), differences in the salience of the two
taxes among market participants, and differences in the costs of taxpayer compliance or tax
administration. Without any such differences, the choice between the two approaches would
be arbitrary. With them, there might be an advantage to adopting one approach rather than
the other, which is a good reason for identifying an equivalence in the first place. For distinct
reasons, for example if one approach causes taxes to be more hidden than the other does,
there could be differences in political appeal.
Equivalences among different approaches to taxation are common in the literature, but
analyses that discuss them generally focus on one particular market context, such as
international trade, labor markets, or saving and investment. 1 The objective of the broader
review that follows is to draw out the main issues that relate to tax equivalences, using several
illustrations from important instances of such equivalences that span different areas of
taxation. In addition, although most of the equivalences discussed below have appeared in the
2

previous literature, a number of them will be unfamiliar to many readers. This lack of
familiarity has contributed to erroneous arguments regarding the properties and relative
attractiveness of different taxes, particularly in cases where new approaches to taxation have
been the subject of discussion.
Drawing on different examples, the next section of the paper reviews the types of
differences that might arise between otherwise equivalent tax systems, i.e., factors that might
contribute to making an equivalence less than exact and hence relevant to the design of tax
policy. Section III uses illustrations of such differences to demonstrate how they matter in the
implementation of tax policy. Many of the equivalences introduced in sections II and III
concern the taxation of capital income and the relationship among different taxes bases, such
as wealth, capital income, consumption, and cash flow. Section IV provides some concluding
comments.
While the analysis will cover many important tax equivalences, the aim here is not to
provide a comprehensive catalog. In addition, we leave aside other important areas of policy
equivalence. One such area, covered only briefly below, is between tax-based and spendingbased policies, associated with the concept of “tax expenditures.” Another is between taxbased and regulation-based policies. Familiar examples here include the classic equivalence
between tariffs and quotas in international trade, those between environmental polices based
on taxes and quantity restrictions (as discussed in Weitzman 1974), and indeed the recently
litigated one between mandates and taxes in health insurance markets. Although the paper
will not discuss these categories of policy equivalences directly, we note that many of the issues
considered here carry over to these other contexts, and that many of this paper’s lessons apply.

II. Differences Relevant to Tax Equivalences
In addition to which side of a market faces the tax, there are many other differences relevant
when considering tax equivalences. We discuss these differences in this section, while
maintaining the assumption of perfect competition, information, etc., deferring until the next
section how real-world considerations may cause the equivalences to break down. As we
show, several of these differences may apply simultaneously to a particular tax equivalence.

A. Differences in Form or Characterization
Perhaps the closest equivalences involve taxes assessed in the same manner on the same
individuals, but with some superficial difference in form or characterization. One such
equivalence relates to whether a tax benefit is delivered as a tax credit or as tax deduction (or
exclusion). For any given tax rate, 𝑡𝑡, a deduction or exclusion from the tax base of an amount is
equivalent to a fractional tax credit on that amount at a rate equal to the tax rate; e.g., a

taxpayer facing a 15 percent marginal tax rate would receive the same benefit from a deduction
and a 15 percent tax credit. Naturally, for a progressive tax system, equivalence to a deduction
would generally require a schedule of credit rates increasing with income, a point often made
when comparing the distributional effects of credits versus deductions.
Another equivalence with respect to form involves the imposition of a tax on a taxexclusive basis versus a tax-inclusive basis, i.e., having the tax apply to gross expenditures
(including tax) or net expenditures (excluding tax). A tax at rate 𝑡𝑡 applied on a tax-inclusive
𝑡𝑡

basis is equivalent to a tax at rate 1−𝑡𝑡 applied on a tax-exclusive basis. As an illustration, one
could impose a consumption tax of 25 percent on a tax-exclusive basis or at 20 percent on a

4

tax-inclusive basis. It is sometimes more natural to use one approach or the other. For
example, as laid out in Andrews (1974), one might tax consumption through a personal tax on
income used to finance consumption expenditures (i.e., by providing a deduction under an
income tax for net saving). For this, a tax-inclusive approach would be more natural: if income
(𝑌𝑌) is exhausted by consumption (𝐶𝐶), savings (𝑆𝑆) and taxes (𝑇𝑇), so that 𝑌𝑌 = 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑆𝑆 + 𝑇𝑇, then a

tax on income less savings is a tax on 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑇𝑇. It would be more natural to implement a

consumption tax taking the form of a retail sales tax on a tax-exclusive basis (as sales taxes
currently are), adding the tax to the net-of-tax price of consumption goods and services.
There is a one-to-one correspondence between tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive rates and
hence no evident importance whether one uses a tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive approach.
Unfortunately, even this equivalence can be misunderstood, as appears to have been the case
during the U.S. debate over a national retail sales tax, for which proponents sometimes
expressed the rate on a tax-inclusive basis, contrary to the common sales-tax approach that
others might have inferred was being used (Gale 2005).
A related distinction involves whether prices are quoted inclusive or exclusive of tax. In
the United States, goods subject to retail sales taxes (RSTs) have their prices quoted exclusive of
tax, while excise taxes are included in listed prices, which is also the case for value added taxes
(VATs) in place outside the United States. This distinction closely tracks whether the tax is
assessed on sellers or buyers, but, in principle, one could have prices quoted as inclusive of tax
even if the formal tax liability were on buyers.
The comparison between a proportional retail sales tax and a proportional personal
consumption tax highlights another minor distinction between otherwise equivalent taxes,
5

namely between indirect and direct taxes, the former (in this case, the sales tax) applying to
transactions and the latter (the personal consumption tax) applying to individuals (or, in other
instances, businesses). As the retail sales tax is legally an obligation of individual purchasers,
both taxes are proportional taxes on consumption assessed on individuals – the same tax rate,
tax base, and taxpayer. Yet, the direct-indirect distinction is relevant in law, perhaps because in
practice, direct and indirect taxes have usually differed in more substantive ways as well.
Through treaties and other international agreements, this legal distinction between direct and
indirect taxes has the potential to introduce real differences in economic impact even in cases
where none would exist otherwise.
A more substantive economic difference in form occurs between unit taxes (also called
specific taxes) and ad valorem taxes. Unit taxes are assessed per unit of quantity, 𝑞𝑞, while ad

valorem taxes are assessed per unit of expenditure, 𝑝𝑝⋅ 𝑞𝑞. For any given price, 𝑝𝑝, a unit tax at
𝑡𝑡

rate t is equivalent to an ad valorem tax at rate 𝑝𝑝.

Finally, one tax may be equivalent to a combination of other taxes. Notably, it would be

possible to implement the VAT as the combination of two taxes, one a proportional tax on
wages and the other a proportional tax, at the same rate, on the non-wage components of
value added. This equivalence is at the heart of flat tax proposals, as in Hall and Rabushka
(1983). These authors’ reason for breaking up the two pieces of the VAT was to facilitate a shift
in the location of the wage component to the individual level from the firm – to the other side
of the labor market, leaving only a cash-flow tax at the business level. 2 However, this second
step does not inherently follow the first: one could implement the two taxes separately at the
business level.
6

Another familiar equivalence between one tax policy and a combination of others, in the
international trade context, is between a tariff on imported goods and the combination of a tax
on all domestic sales and a domestic production subsidy at the same rate, since aggregate
domestic sales equals the sum of sales by foreign sellers and those by domestic sellers.
Yet another important example of the equivalence of one policy instrument and a
combination of others involves investment incentives, such as an investment tax credit or an
accelerated schedule of depreciation allowances. Since these incentives lower the present
value of taxes associated with new investment, which, as discussed below, is equivalent to
reducing the tax rate on the income from such investment, one may think of them as a
combination of (1) a reduction in taxes on the income from old and new capital; and (2) an
offsetting tax increase on the income from old capital (or, alternatively, a capital levy on the
value of old capital).

B. Differences in Entities
There are cases in which a given tax may be collected from more than one entity. For example,
individuals may pay taxes related to their assets or associated income directly, as individual
taxpayers, or indirectly through the entities or accounts they own, such as corporations or
retirement accounts. In other cases, even where individuals own businesses that receive and
report the income, the income is taxed directly to the individuals, through pass-through
treatment.
Another example concerns the individual income tax, which is assessed on individuals
but, through withholding, collected and remitted by employers. The same is true with the
employee portion of the OASDHI payroll tax.
7

C. Differences in Markets
Consider a one-period model in which individuals earn labor income and use their income to
purchase two consumption goods, so that the budget constraint in the absence of taxation is
𝑝𝑝1 𝑐𝑐1 + 𝑝𝑝2 𝑐𝑐2 = 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤,

(1)

where 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 and 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 are the price and quantity of good-𝑖𝑖 consumption, 𝑤𝑤 is the wage rate and 𝐿𝐿 is

labor supply. Even though labor income taxes and consumption taxes are imposed in different
markets (for labor and consumption goods), it is easy to see in this model that proportional
taxes on labor and consumption are equivalent, with this equivalence working through the
individual’s budget constraint.
A tax on labor income at rate 𝑡𝑡 multiplies the right-hand side of the budget constraint by

(1 − 𝑡𝑡), and a uniform, proportional tax on consumption at rate τ divides the left-hand side of
the budget constraint by (1 − τ) (assuming that both are imposed on a tax inclusive basis.)
Setting τ = 𝑡𝑡 leaves the individual with the same budget constraint and provides the
government with the same amount of tax revenue.

Note that the equivalence between the two taxes in this example does not require the
observed price level to be the same in the two cases. For example, if the wage rate paid by
firms and the prices received by them were fixed in nominal terms, a sales tax added to
producer prices would raise the consumer price level, while a tax subtracted from employee
wages would not. But relative prices (between the two goods and between each good and
labor, and hence the real wage) are still the same in the two cases.

8

D. Differences in Timing
Tax policies may also differ with respect to the timing of tax payments. The equivalence
between proportional taxes on labor income and consumption just discussed carries over in a
life-cycle model in which individuals neither leave nor receive bequests. In a two-period
version of that model, in which the individual is retired in the second period and there is one
consumption good in each period, the lifetime budget constraint without taxes is
1

𝑝𝑝1 𝑐𝑐1 + 1+𝑟𝑟 𝑝𝑝2 𝑐𝑐2 = 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤,

(2)

where 𝑟𝑟 is the interest rate, the two consumption goods from expression (1) are reinterpreted

as first- and second-period consumption, and 𝐿𝐿 is first-period labor supply. As in the previous

example, the individual and government budget constraints are the same – in this case in
present value – under equal-rate consumption and labor income taxes.

A slight modification of the budget constraint in (2) applies when the individual starts
period 1 with initial assets, which may be interpreted as an inheritance, access to above-market
rates of return, or rents, on certain investments of fixed size, or, in the analysis of a tax reform,
as the asset accumulated by the individual in past periods. For the budget constraint,
1

𝑝𝑝1 𝑐𝑐1 + 1+𝑟𝑟 𝑝𝑝2 𝑐𝑐2 = 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 + 𝐴𝐴,

(3)

the tax on consumption is equivalent to the combination of two other taxes, on labor income
and initial assets. This distinction between wage taxes and consumption taxes – the capital levy
on initial wealth – features prominently in discussions of the efficiency and distributional
properties of the adoption of a consumption tax (e.g., Auerbach and Kotlikoff 1987). Indeed,
9

this is the same distinction as in the case of investment incentives versus reductions in capital
income taxes, given the saving-investment identity and the fact that consumption equals
income less saving.
Of course, whether the component 𝐴𝐴 in the budget constraint in (3) is truly exogenous

from a broader perspective, for example taking account of previous decisions regarding saving
or the location of investment that would be influenced by an anticipated tax on 𝐴𝐴, plays an

important role in how one interprets potential efficiency effects.

E. Portfolio Adjustments
In the previous equivalence example, the individual and the government both have the same
present-value budget constraints across tax systems, but translating these budget constraints
into the same economic outcome requires additional adjustments to private and government
saving. The individual must save more under a consumption tax than under a wage tax to
achieve the same first-and second-period consumption, because some tax payments are
deferred under a consumption tax. Likewise, the government must save less under the
consumption tax, which provides it with some resources in the second period. There is no
difference in national saving between the two cases, just the division of national saving
between private and public saving. (This illustrates the limited usefulness of focusing on how
tax policies affect specific components of saving.)
A more complex response is needed in cases where there is uncertainty, as the impact
of tax systems on the riskiness of assets may call for changes not only in the level of saving but
also with regard to portfolio composition. 3 To focus specifically on this issue, suppose that in
the two-period budget constraint both labor and first period consumption are fixed, so that the
10

individual saves a fixed amount, 𝑉𝑉, allocating a share 𝑎𝑎 to a risky asset yielding a stochastic

return 𝑥𝑥 and a share (1 − 𝑎𝑎) to a safe asset yielding a certain return 𝑟𝑟. Then, without taxes,

second-period consumption equals 𝑉𝑉 multiplied by [1 + 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 + (1 − 𝑎𝑎)𝑟𝑟]. If a proportional

income tax at rate 𝑡𝑡 is imposed on excess returns – those returns above the rate 𝑟𝑟 – then the

expression for second-period consumption becomes 𝑉𝑉⋅[1 + 𝑟𝑟 + 𝑎𝑎(𝑥𝑥 − 𝑟𝑟)(1 − 𝑡𝑡)]. It follows

that the individual can achieve the same outcome as in the absence of taxation by increasing
the portfolio share invested in the risky asset from 𝑎𝑎 to

𝑎𝑎

1−𝑡𝑡

. From the government’s

perspective, the same adjustment in reverse will be needed to maintain the original level of risk
in the government’s revenue stream (assuming that combining different taxpayers’ risky tax

payments results in no additional risk-pooling 4). That is, the government will need to shift
some of its investment portfolio from risky to safe assets, as might be achieved, for example, by
reducing government borrowing – which makes the government’s net position in safe assets
less negative – and at the same time reducing public investment, which type of investment
presumably yields uncertain returns.
If a tax on excess returns has no impact on individual or government budget constraints,
it follows that a tax on all returns, equal to a tax on the risk-free and excess return components,
is equivalent to a tax only on the risk-free components. This tax on risk-free returns, in turn, is
equivalent to a tax on wealth, following the equivalence between unit and ad valorem taxes
discussed above, since a tax at rate 𝑡𝑡 on returns at the risk-free rate on wealth, 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟, is equivalent

to a tax at rate 𝑡𝑡⋅𝑟𝑟 on wealth itself, 𝑉𝑉.

11

III. Tax Equivalences and the Implementation of Tax Policy
If all of the conditions for complete equivalence held, then it would be a matter of indifference
through which equivalent version a particular tax policy were implemented. It is through the
exceptions to equivalence that choices among otherwise equivalent policies matter.

A. Perception and Salience
Otherwise-equivalent taxes may differ in how they are perceived by market participants or by
those engaged in the political process. As to the former, empirical evidence (Chetty, Looney,
and Kroft 2009) suggests that taxes included in prices (e.g., excise taxes) have a larger impact
on consumer responses than those that are added to seller-quoted prices (e.g., sales taxes).
Lower salience can have complex effects on a policy’s desirability, reducing deadweight loss
because of a lower sensitivity to taxation but increasing it through a misallocation of household
budget constraints. In addition, to the extent that salience differs among households, the use
of less salient forms of taxation may have adverse distributional consequences (Goldin and
Homonoff 2013). Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018) describe the various ways in which salience
and other psychological biases may cause equivalences to break down, and emphasize the
importance of considering the actual tax policies being implemented, rather than the
underlying incentives and budget sets that may establish policies as equivalent.
As distinct from how psychological factors may influence the behavior of direct market
participants, such factors may also lead the political process to treat economically equivalent
taxes differently, possibly influencing the form of policies adopted. A common reference here
is the distinction between the employer and employee components of the payroll tax, both of
which are withheld by the employer prior to paying workers but which are officially assessed on
12

different sides of the labor market. Even though we lack strong evidence that these
components affect labor outcomes differently simply because of the side of the market on
which they are imposed (except in specific cases where wage adjustments are difficult, as
where minimum wages intervene or where differential wage changes would be required) 5, the
durability of these separate components suggests that statutory incidence is politically quite
relevant, perhaps because policy equivalences are not sufficiently evident or well-understood.
Standard conventions for analyzing the distributional effects of taxes may also
contribute to perceived differences. For example, in earlier years it was common for U.S.
government agencies not to allocate corporate taxes to individual taxpayers for purposes of
analyzing the distributional effects of taxes. This meant that equivalent tax policies, such as a
corporate tax reduction for dividends paid and a shareholder tax reduction for dividends
received, would have been treated quite differently, being ignored in the former case and
included in the latter case. More recently, the convention of viewing a standard VAT as a tax on
retail sales borne by consumers, but the components of the two-part VAT (described above) as,
respectively, taxes falling on asset owners and on workers, helped sow confusion over the
distributional effects of a business cash-flow tax, i.e., the first component of the two-part VAT
(Viard 2018).
Just as differences in the statutory incidence of taxes may affect perceptions of these
taxes, so may the distinction as to whether policy changes are classified as affecting taxes or
transfer payments. In 1993, for example, this labeling choice resulted in an argument in
Congress about whether to characterize the pending increase in the taxation of social security
benefits (from 50 percent to 85 percent of benefits subject to tax, over an exempt threshold) as
13

a tax increase or as a reduction in government spending, given its equivalence to a policy of
reducing social security benefits. Potentially hinging on the choice of terminology was one’s
conclusion about the policy’s impact on the “size of government,” which some would see a
benefit cut (but not a tax increase) as reducing, based on measuring the size of government
using the level of government spending. A similar issue arises with the Earned Income Tax
Credit, which for budget scoring purposes is divided between a tax reduction and a component
of government spending depending on whether a recipient receives a net payment from the
government (which is treated as spending), but which also could be implemented solely as an
expenditure-based transfer program.

B. Market Imperfections
Tax equivalences may also break down when market imperfections are present. It may be
possible to lessen the impact of such imperfections by choosing a particular version of a tax
policy. We focus on three types of imperfections below: liquidity constraints, incomplete
private risk-pooling, and private-sector market power.
1. Liquidity Constraints
When households or firms face liquidity constraints, shifting tax liability to periods when such
constraints are relaxed may improve market outcomes. As emphasized by Hubbard and Judd
(1986), this could change one’s conclusions about tax policies that shift the timing of tax
payments. From the perspective of equivalent taxes, it could introduce a difference between
two systems that differ only with respect to timing. For example, in the pure life-cycle model
with no initial assets (i.e., for the lifetime budget constraint in expression (2)), individuals facing
liquidity constraints in the first period would fare worse under a labor income tax than under a
14

consumption tax, which shifts some of their tax liabilities to the second period, after they have
accumulated assets.
Liquidity constraints may influence firms as well. Consider the case of the incentive to
invest, which according to standard analysis depends on the present value of depreciation
deductions, but not their timing. Under this standard analysis, immediate expensing of
investment is equivalent to following a standard pattern of depreciation deductions over time,
but with an additional deduction for the nominal rate of interest multiplied by the
undepreciated asset basis in each year (Boadway and Bruce 1984). That is, rather than
receiving an immediate deduction of the cost of investment, writing off the asset at some
geometric rate, α, leaves an undepreciated basis of 𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 and a depreciation allowance of 𝛼𝛼𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼
at date 𝑡𝑡 per dollar of initial investment. Providing the taxpayer also with a deduction for the

nominal interest rate, 𝑟𝑟, multiplied by the undepreciated basis yields a total deduction at date
∞

𝑡𝑡 of (𝑟𝑟 + 𝛼𝛼)𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 . The present value of all such deductions is ∫0 𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 (𝑟𝑟 + 𝛼𝛼)𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 1, the
same value as under immediate expensing. 6

If firms are liquidity constrained, though, expensing or other investment incentives that
are more “front-loaded” may be more effective in stimulating investment. There is convincing
evidence that liquidity-constrained firms respond more strongly than other firms to up-front
investment incentives such as expensing and “bonus” depreciation (which allows firms a
fractional immediate write-off of qualifying investment expenses). This response does not
occur simply through a reduction in the present value of taxes, but due to a shift in the timing
of taxes as well (Zwick and Mahon 2017).

15

2. Incomplete Risk-Pooling
To the extent that private markets do not efficiently pool risks, taxes that shift risks from
taxpayers to the government may reduce aggregate risk. In this case, the tax on all returns to
investment would no longer be equivalent to a tax only on the risk-free rate of return, contrary
to the result discussed earlier. Taxing all returns would reduce aggregate risk, through the
pooling of the investment risks faced by taxpayers.
However, one needs to ask why markets may inefficiently pool risk. To the extent that
risk-pooling would harm economic incentives (for example, in the case of entrepreneurs whose
effort may influence the distribution of risky outcomes), efficiency may call for incomplete riskpooling. In such cases, lessening an individual’s exposure to risk through taxation could have
the same negative effect as further private risk-pooling.
3. Market Power
When firms have market power, certain tax equivalences break down and leave one alternative
preferable to the other. For example, the equivalence between unit and ad valorem taxes
relies on the assumption that firms are price-takers. If firms are not, then they will consider the
sensitivity of profits to variations in price, which ad valorem taxes dampen because they are
imposed in relation to prices. This can lead to lower prices and more output under ad valorem
taxes than under unit taxes (Delipalla and Keen 1992).
Another aspect of imperfect competition is the presence of non-competitive rents
earned by firms. In this case, the equivalence between expensing of new investment and
imposing no tax on the returns to such investment breaks down, as with expensing there is no
tax in present value on the returns to marginal investment but there is a tax on investments
16

yielding above-market returns. For an investment with cash flows 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 at each date 𝑖𝑖, allowance

of investment expensing results in a cash-flow tax. Under a cash-flow tax, the government

taxes positive flows and negative flows (i.e., investment costs) at a common tax rate 𝑡𝑡. This

means that from the investor’s point of view all cash flows are all multiplied by (1 − 𝑡𝑡), so that

after-tax cash flows at each date are (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 . Thus, there is no change in the present value of
investments with a before-tax present value of zero, for (1 − 𝑡𝑡) multiplied by zero is still zero.

Hence, the cash-flow tax is equivalent, except for timing, to imposing no tax on returns to

marginal investments. On the other hand, positive present-value investments are reduced in
value by a factor of 𝑡𝑡. This means not only that the positive returns to past investments will be

taxed – in present value, there is a capital levy on returns to “old” capital, for which past

investments receive no expensing deduction – but also that future rents will be taxed as well.
This ability to capture a portion of rents using a cash-flow tax holds if the tax is imposed
at the firm level. Unless the firm is taxed on a pass-through basis, the timing of such rent
taxation will differ for taxation at the individual level. Without rents, a cash-flow tax at the firm
level and at the shareholder level would be equivalent, assuming the same rate of tax and that
the value of the firm equals the value of its assets. It would not matter if cash flowing into the
firm were deducted by the individual owner or by the firm itself, or whether cash flowing out of
the firm were taxable to the firm or to the ultimate recipient. However, if rents are present at
the firm level, this equivalence is altered, for the value of the firm should include the capitalized
value of its rents. 7 Hence, rents would face no tax at the individual level once they have been
capitalized, with the tax on such capitalized rents being paid in advance by those original
shareholders who owned the firm when the capitalization occurred. This difference in timing
17

need not break the equivalence, if tax rates remain constant over time; nor would the incidence
of the taxes differ, in both cases falling on the original shareholders, as future taxes imposed at
the firm level would be taken into account in the determination of the value at which they
could sell their shares.

C. Government Accounting and Budget Rules
Equivalences among different policies may also break down because of government accounting
and budget rules and conventions. For example, having different rules that apply to transfer
payments and taxes can disrupt the equivalence between a reduction in benefits and a tax on
those benefits. However, perhaps the biggest impact of government accounting, for policies
that differ with respect to timing, comes from the use of a limited time horizon, in particular
the focus on revenues over a one-year, five-year or ten-year period. With budget
measurement that applies only through a certain date, policies that shift revenue losses outside
the budget window relax the constraints that legislators face. 8 The creation and expansion of
so-called “Roth” accounts for retirement saving owe much to this motive, as do tax incentives
for conversion of other retirement accounts into Roth accounts.
Roth accounts follow the TEE (Taxable/Exempt/Exempt) pattern of taxation with respect
to the three phases of saving: initial contributions, inside build-up during the accumulation
period, and withdrawals, respectively. This is in contrast to the EET approach traditionally
followed for pensions and other retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k) plans. The
approaches are economically equivalent if the tax rate does not change over time, another
instance of the equivalence between cash-flow taxation and tax exemption. The equivalence
here also relies on the additional but reasonable assumptions that there are no rents earned by
18

investors themselves in making passive retirement-account investments and that government
taxation of ex post returns from such investments under the EET approach does not improve
risk-pooling.
However, when the budget window is truncated, the government revenue losses
associated with the Roth accounts are understated relative to those following the traditional
timing of tax payments. Relative to a full, present-value accounting of the revenue costs of
adopting tax-favored saving accounts, the TEE approach understates the cost, by ignoring
future revenue losses, while the EET approach overstates the cost, by ignoring future revenue
recoupment.
A related example comes from the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which was constructed to
have a balanced revenue impact over a five-year budget window. In that setting, a policy of
eliminating the investment tax credit and lowering the corporate tax rate on new investment to
maintain the same present value of taxes on such investment would have shown a revenue
gain, with the tax cuts on the income from the first five years’ investment falling to some extent
outside the budget window and the tax increase from eliminating the investment tax credit
falling fully within the budget window. This may have influenced the ultimate policy outcome,
which was to reduce the corporate income tax rate (on all investment) while eliminating the
investment tax credit, a policy that provided windfalls to existing capital (i.e., a reverse of the
capital levy that would have resulted from increasing the investment tax credit and the
corporate tax rate) while actually raising the effective tax rate on new investment (Auerbach
1987).

19

To the extent that distributional analysis of tax policies adheres to the limited-budgetwindow approach, one encounters the same problem that fundamentally equivalent polices
may be perceived (or at least reported) as being quite different. For example, given that
retirement saving is concentrated among higher-income individuals, the distributional impact of
the EET approach will appear less progressive than it is, and less progressive than the TEE
approach, because it will show tax deductions during the budget window while ignoring the
eventual tax payments made on withdrawals outside the budget window.
In addition to government accounting, private accounting conventions may also
influence how otherwise equivalent tax policies are viewed. One important example is the
treatment of tax benefits based on timing, such as accelerated depreciation, which do not
affect measured tax rates in public financial statements, because in such statements the time
value of money is ignored in the computation of the deferred tax liabilities arising from
accelerating deductions. This convention makes investment incentives provided through
accelerated depreciation appear different in companies’ financial statements from direct tax
rate reductions, even if the present value of tax benefits is the same for the two policies.
Companies seeking to report higher after-tax earnings may prefer tax rate reductions to
accelerated depreciation for this reason, even if other factors (such as liquidity constraints)
might point in the other direction; and this preference may have political consequences as well.
As with government accounting rules and conventions, financial accounting procedures may
affect both private decisions and political outcomes.

D. Tax Administration
Differences among otherwise equivalent taxes arise in many dimensions relating to the ease of
administering and enforcing tax systems as well as the costs of compliance to taxpayers. We
consider three such dimensions below, relating to a tax system’s self-correcting features (its
ability to adapt to changes in economic conditions without being explicitly modified), the costs
of enforcement and compliance, and, especially, the information required by the government
for its implementation.
1. Self-Correcting Features
Tax systems that respond automatically to fluctuations in the economy or a taxpayer’s
individual circumstances have an administrative advantage over those requiring explicit
adjustment on the part of the government.
One challenge from the economic environment is inflation, which causes problems with
measuring the tax base as well as with adjusting the tax schedule. Measuring the tax base is
especially a problem for capital income, where nominal income must be adjusted for changes in
the purchasing power of assets over time. For example, the present value of historic-cost
depreciation allowances, 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡) at each date 𝑡𝑡, permitted over time per unit cost of an asset
∞

purchased at date 0, equals ∫0 𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 , where 𝑟𝑟 is the nominal discount factor. As the

inflation rate rises, so does r, and this reduces the present value of depreciation deductions,
even if the real interest rate is unaffected. This problem motivated the proposal by Auerbach
and Jorgenson (1980) for “first-year capital recovery” – permitting firms to deduct in the year of
an asset’s purchase the present value of depreciation allowances, calculated using an assumed

21

real interest rate, equal to the nominal discount rate 𝑟𝑟 minus the inflation rate π, or
∞

∫0 𝑒𝑒 −(𝑟𝑟−𝜋𝜋)𝑡𝑡 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 .

In the absence of inflation, the two approaches – actual deduction of depreciation

allowances over time, and up-front deduction of the present value of these depreciation
allowances – would yield the same deduction, in present value. In the presence of inflation, it
would be necessary to index depreciation allowances for inflation – to multiply them by 𝑒𝑒 −𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋 –
for the present value of allowances to equal those provided by first-year capital recovery,
∞

∞

∫0 𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑒𝑒 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = ∫0 𝑒𝑒 −(𝑟𝑟−𝜋𝜋)𝑡𝑡 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 .

As for adjusting the tax schedule, this presents another difference between ad valorem

and unit taxes. Whereas ad valorem taxes rise in proportion to prices, and so maintain their
real value as prices rise, unit taxes do not, making continual adjustments necessary, which may
be particularly burdensome in economies with high rates of inflation.
Another issue of self-correction relates to the fact that the income tax has a progressive
marginal tax rate schedule applied on an annual basis. Because of this convexity in the tax
schedule, for individuals with the same average income over time, those with fluctuating
incomes face higher average tax rates than those with stable incomes. Here, the EET approach
to pension taxation may be preferable to the TEE approach, although the ability to choose
between the two may provide a further improvement in performance.
Consider, again, the two-period life-cycle model in which individuals work and save for
retirement in the first period and consume in both periods. Under the EET approach, the firstperiod tax base equals wage income less saving, or the amount of first-period consumption
expenditure, and the second-period tax base equals the amount of second-period consumption
22

expenditure. Thus, if the household smooths consumption fully, the tax base will be the same
in both periods. Under the TEE approach, by contrast, the first-period tax base will be higher –
equal to all wage income – and the second-period tax base lower – in this case equal to zero.
Thus, the EET approach incorporates an automatic income-averaging feature that is absent
under the TEE approach.
While the EET approach results in complete smoothing of the tax base in this simple
case, it would not do so if a taxpayer’s preferences led to a rising or falling consumption profile,
or in cases of year-to-year fluctuations in consumption expenditures. For the general case, one
could improve smoothing simply by giving the taxpayer a choice between the TEE and EET
approaches each year. For example, having a choice would facilitate shifting the tax base to
years with low consumer expenditures by using the TEE approach in those years. Indeed,
making this choice available was suggested in U.S. Treasury (1977) for implementing a personal
consumption tax, under which all saving would be tax-favored, following either the EET or the
TEE approach. 9
2. Enforcement and Compliance
Even though taxes may have the same impact in a world of costless enforcement and complete
information, in a realistic setting important differences may arise.
One difference involves the identity of the person or entity with either the statutory
responsibility for a tax or the obligation to remit the tax (as in the case of firms that withhold
and remit income taxes on behalf of individual taxpayers who have the statutory responsibility
for the taxes). In many situations, it is easier to monitor firms than individuals.

23

Another difference relates to the incentives for taxpayer compliance. A classic
illustration is the difference between the VAT and the RST. From national income accounting,
we know that final consumption equals value added less investment, government purchases,
and net exports:
𝐶𝐶 = 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 − 𝐼𝐼 − 𝐺𝐺 – (𝑋𝑋 – 𝑀𝑀).

(4)

Hence, there is an equivalence between a VAT and an RST, which is imposed directly on
consumption. One may express this equivalence in terms of a series of switches in tax liability,
from seller to buyer, for each intermediate transaction in the value-added chain, starting from
the VAT. This cascade of switches from seller to buyer at each successive stage, none of which
affects the equilibrium outcome, ultimately concentrates the entire tax liability at the last point
of sale, as under the RST. However, under a credit-invoice VAT, each successive seller is able to
deduct purchased inputs from the tax base only by presenting evidence that tax was previously
paid on the sales of such inputs, providing a third-party enforcement mechanism that is absent
under the RST.
3. Information
In addition to ease of enforcement, some versions of equivalent tax systems require less
information on the part of government than other versions. One may think of this, ultimately,
as an issue of enforcement as well, although it is useful to understand the sources of
enforcement challenges. Many of the illustrations below involve some form of cash-flow
taxation, which is endowed with the natural informational advantage of being based only on
observable cash flows.
24

Consider the taxation of consumption, which as just discussed could be implemented
through a VAT. Leaving aside the tax exemption for government purchases (which, for a unified
government, is of no consequence, as it amounts to a government paying taxes to itself) and
the exemption for net exports – to which we return below – a VAT amounts to a tax on income
net of investment. Income may be broken into wage and non-wage components, and thus one
may implement the consumption tax as a cash-flow tax on non-wage income net of investment,
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 − 𝐼𝐼 – 𝑊𝑊, plus a tax on wages, 𝑊𝑊. As mentioned earlier, one may tax these two

components separately, as under a flat tax, but unless they face different rates of tax (as they
would under a flat tax), this separation is unnecessary. Indeed, VATs as traditionally
implemented do not distinguish between wage and non-wage components of value added.
As already discussed, a business cash-flow tax – the non-wage component of the VAT –
effectively exempts the safe rate of return to investment, but not rents. To the extent that
rents are not important (as in the case of passive investments), one could also exempt the safe
rate of return simply by imposing a zero tax rate on returns to capital. However, imposing a
zero tax rate on returns to capital and a positive tax rate on wages requires that the
government be able to distinguish between capital income and labor income, whereas this is
not necessary under a VAT or other forms of consumption taxation, such as a personal
consumption tax, which tax expenditures rather than income. A consumption tax approach to
exempting the return to capital alleviates the need to distinguish between capital and labor
income, and is not subject to the argument against exempting returns to capital based on the
concern that taxpayers will attempt to disguise labor income as capital income to achieve a
lower tax rate. Put another way, a business cash-flow tax falls on all returns in excess of the
25

safe rate, including rents as well as disguised labor income, in addition to the returns to risktaking.
Another illustration of differential information requirements in equivalent tax systems
arises with respect to the taxation of capital gains. A problematic feature of capital gains
taxation is the realization doctrine, under which capital gains are taxed only when assets are
sold and the gains “realized.” Because delaying realization allows an investor to defer tax on
gains already accrued, this causes a “lock-in” effect, an economic distortion whereby investors
continue to hold assets that they otherwise would wish to sell.
A potential solution to the lock-in effect is to tax capital gains on accrual or, to deal with
possible liquidity problems coming from having to pay taxes before assets are sold, to continue
taxing gains upon realization but with an annual interest charge being added to the tax on gains
already accrued but not yet realized. That is, as proposed originally by Vickrey (1939), the tax
accrued as of the end of period 𝑡𝑡 on an asset purchased at the end of period 0 would be:
𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 = [1 + 𝑟𝑟(1 − 𝜏𝜏)]𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜏𝜏(𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 − 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡−1 ),

(5)

where 𝑇𝑇0 = 0, 𝑟𝑟 is the safe rate of return applied to unpaid taxes, 𝜏𝜏 is the income tax rate

(assumed here to be the same for interest and capital gains), and 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 is the value of the asset at
the end of period 𝑡𝑡. An obstacle to implementing this method of taxation (or accrual taxation)

is that the government may not observe the path of 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 , but only the asset’s value at the times

of initial purchase and final sale. One could assume some arbitrary path of appreciation after
observing the sale price at realization, for example using a smooth geometric growth rate

between the purchase and sale dates, but doing so would not fully eliminate the lock-in effect
26

(or its opposite, an incentive to realize losses immediately) if the assumed path differs from the
actual one. 10
However, as shown in Auerbach (1991), a tax liability that instead evolves according to
the expression

𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 = �1 − �

1+𝑟𝑟 (1−𝜏𝜏) 𝑡𝑡
1+𝑟𝑟

� � 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡

(6)

(which depends only on the holding period 𝑡𝑡 and the observed value at realization) imposes the

same tax rate τ at each date 𝑡𝑡 on the safe component of the rate of return, 𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡−1 , as in (5),
and a tax rate of �1 − �

1+𝑟𝑟(1−𝜏𝜏) 𝑡𝑡
1+𝑟𝑟

� � on the excess return, (𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 − 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡−1 ) − 𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡−1 . This tax rate on

the excess return differs from that on the safe return component, and from the tax rate under
the Vickrey approach. But, as discussed above in relation to the taxation of risky assets, the

investor can use a portfolio adjustment to offset the tax on the excess return, leaving the
investor in the same position as under the tax system in (5), but without the government
needing to observe the asset appreciation trajectory in order to eliminate the lock-in effect.
The retrospective capital gains tax system described in (6) eliminates the need for the
government to observe any asset’s appreciation pattern, but it still requires the observation of
the holding period and sale price for each asset subject to capital gains taxation. However,
even these requirements can be eliminated by adopting a generalized version of the system,
based on cash-flow taxation. As Auerbach and Bradford (2004) show, taxing all of the investor’s
cash flows (positive and negative, from all investments) at date 𝑡𝑡 at a rate equal to
�1 − 𝑎𝑎 �

1+𝑟𝑟(1−𝜏𝜏) 𝑡𝑡−𝐵𝐵
1+𝑟𝑟

�

�,

(7)
27

where 𝐵𝐵 is some fixed base-year reference date for each taxpayer and 𝑎𝑎 is an arbitrary

constant, would have the same properties as the retrospective capital gains tax (a specific
version of the system described in (7) for which 𝑎𝑎 = 1 and 𝐵𝐵 equals the date of purchase, and
hence must be different for each asset). Thus, one of the main advantages of cash-flow

taxation – not needing to measure asset income – carries over even when the tax system does
impose an income tax, effectively reducing the normal return to investment through a cashflow tax rate that rises over time.
Returning once again to the simple, constant-rate cash-flow tax, an important
equivalence first noted by the Meade Committee Report (Institute for Fiscal Studies 1978) was
between different methods of implementing a cash-flow tax. As that report (Chapter 12)
observed, the transactions of the business sector are related by an identity which, using our
notation, may be written for a closed economy as
(𝑅𝑅 − 𝐼𝐼 ) + 𝐹𝐹 + 𝑆𝑆 = 0,

(8)

where 𝑅𝑅 equals the cash-flow returns to real investment expenditures, 𝐼𝐼, 𝐹𝐹 equals net

financial inflows to the firm (excluding transactions with shareholders), including net borrowing
and net interest receipts, and 𝑆𝑆 equals dividend payments and net transactions in corporate

shares, i.e., the net inflows to firms from their shareholders. Under the cash-flow (i.e., nonwage) component of most existing VATs, only 𝑅𝑅 − 𝐼𝐼 is included in the tax base – financial

transactions are ignored. The Meade Committee referred to this approach as the 𝑅𝑅 base cash-

28

flow tax, and to the tax base that included the financial flows, 𝐹𝐹, as the 𝑅𝑅 + 𝐹𝐹 base cash-flow

tax.

The present value of a firm’s financial flows 𝐹𝐹 should equal zero to the extent that

borrowing and lending are at the same interest rate – borrowing and lending activities each
having zero present value – and that similar conditions hold for other financial activities, e.g.,
the provision of insurance is actuarially fair, etc. However, this conclusion presumes that any
value added in the financial sector is measured separately from these financial flows and hence
already included in the real returns, 𝑅𝑅.

In reality, much of the value added that the financial sector generates appears not as

explicit payment for services, but instead takes the form of differences in rates of return (e.g., a
lower rate of interest paid to depositors; a higher rate of interest received from borrowers),
higher insurance premiums, or, more generally, differences between financial inflows and
outflows that make 𝐹𝐹 positive in present value. Thus, an 𝑅𝑅 base is likely to miss a large

component of the services provided by financial institutions. An information advantage of
including financial flows in the tax base is that doing so obviates the need to try to distinguish
the value-added components of financial flows, since real and financial flows both are subject
to taxation.
Note also from expression (8) that the 𝑅𝑅 + 𝐹𝐹 base could be implemented simply by

taxing net distributions to shareholders, (−𝑆𝑆), including dividends and net share repurchases. 11
However, imposing a business-level cash-flow tax may be easier from the government’s
perspective than taxing individual shareholders on their net distributions. This is especially so
in the global context, where investments by individuals and companies cross borders. To
29

consider this, we return to expression (4), the national income identity relating consumption to
income.
Assuming, for simplicity of notation that the government imposes a tax on its own
purchases, achieving a consumption tax in an open economy requires not only a tax on wages
plus domestic business cash flows, (𝑊𝑊 + 𝑅𝑅 − 𝐼𝐼 = 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 − 𝐼𝐼), but also a tax on net imports,

𝑀𝑀 – 𝑋𝑋. This last tax component, accomplished by taxing gross imports and providing an equal

subsidy for gross exports, is known as a border adjustment. Border adjustment is a standard
component of existing VATs and is also part of the destination-based cash-flow tax (DBCFT),

which is equivalent to the VAT combined with a deduction for wages (or a VAT combined with a
payroll subsidy at an equal rate).
A familiar equivalence from international trade theory is between a tax on exports and a
tax on imports, which arises from the intertemporal international constraint that a nation’s
exports and imports must be equal, in present value. This is the Lerner Symmetry Theorem
(Lerner 1936) and it implies that a tax on imports and an equal-rate subsidy to exports is
neutral. That is, border adjustment of imports and exports at the same rate is equivalent to no
border adjustment at all.
However, it is the failure of conditions needed for the Lerner Symmetry Theorem that
provides a central, information-based argument for implementing the DBCFT rather than the
origin-based cash-flow tax (the tax on 𝑅𝑅 − 𝐼𝐼 alone, with no border adjustment). In particular,

the government’s inability to observe 𝑅𝑅 – the domestic returns to investment – makes the

DBCFT attractive, to prevent companies from using various accounting techniques to shift
profits to lower-tax jurisdictions (Auerbach 2017, Auerbach et al. 2017).

30

Border adjustment eliminates a company’s ability to shift domestic profits to other
countries using cross-border transactions with related foreign parties, because those
transactions have no impact on the company’s domestic tax liability with the border
adjustment in place. In the computation of a company’s domestic tax base, the revenues from
exports and the expenses of imports are exactly offset by the border adjustments applied to
these items. 12
Understanding the relationship between the DBCFT and the taxation of shareholders
requires the use of one additional identity, relating the capital and current international
accounts. According to the balance of a country’s current and capital accounts (and ignoring
government reserve transactions and international transfer payments which also enter into the
identity), the trade surplus, 𝑋𝑋 − 𝑀𝑀, plus net foreign source income, 𝐸𝐸, equals net foreign

investment; equivalently, the trade deficit equals net foreign source income less net foreign
investment, or 𝑀𝑀 – 𝑋𝑋 = 𝐸𝐸. Substituting this relationship into the definition of the DBCFT tax

base yields:

DBCFT Tax Base = (𝑅𝑅 − 𝐼𝐼 ) + 𝑀𝑀 − 𝑋𝑋 = (𝑅𝑅 – 𝐼𝐼) + 𝐸𝐸.

(9)

That is, as noted in Auerbach (1997), implementing the DBCFT is equivalent to imposing a tax
on domestic cash flows (𝑅𝑅 – 𝐼𝐼) as well as net cross-border cash flows (𝐸𝐸). 13 This equivalence
provides another perspective as to why the DBCFT eliminates the tax incentive for companies

to shift earnings abroad. Because an understatement of domestic earnings and net cash flows,
(𝑅𝑅 – 𝐼𝐼), will lead to an equal-size increase in net foreign-source earnings and net cash flows

from abroad, 𝐸𝐸, misreporting the first component of their sum will have no impact on the

31

DBCFT tax base, although understating (𝑅𝑅 – 𝐼𝐼) in this manner may increase tax liabilities in

other countries that still impose source-based taxes . 14

From this final way of writing the DBCFT tax base, it also follows that, if one adopts the
Meade Committee’s 𝑅𝑅 + 𝐹𝐹 approach and incorporates domestic financial flows 𝐹𝐹 in the tax

base as well, the resulting tax system amounts to the taxation of domestic resident

shareholders on the distributions from their investments, whether these investments are
domestic or foreign. That is, the DBCFT is equivalent to a tax on the distributions received by
domestic shareholders. However, to impose the latter directly would require the government
to observe its domestic shareholders’ net distributions from foreign investments. Through the
international accounts identity, the DBCFT accomplishes the same outcome, working through
different markets (trade in goods and services versus capital and income flows), via the border
adjustment.

IV. Conclusions
Recognizing tax equivalences is important to help us understand the possible economic effects
of tax systems; applying what may be known about the effects of some tax systems may help us
understand the effects of other systems that are equivalent.
Perhaps more important for the design and analysis of tax policy is that understanding
tax equivalences is also a valuable first step in considering the ways in which equivalences may
fail. Such a consideration is useful both for positive analysis (e.g., to understand the political
reasons for choosing one approach over another) and for normative analysis (to determine
which approach may be a more effective way of implementing a policy, given the many

32

deviations from the assumptions of perfect markets and information that can apply in realistic
settings).
Finally, one should keep in mind that deviations from equivalence like those discussed
here need not be immutable. Government budget rules could be more rational, technological
innovations may increase the government’s access to information about taxpayer behavior,
market environments relating to competitiveness and nominal rigidities may change, and so
forth. For a similar reason, specific policy prescriptions may differ across countries at any given
time. Thus, perhaps the most important lesson to be taken from the discussion here relates to
the process of evaluating tax policy rather than any particular results. One can learn much from
understanding tax equivalences and deviations from them. Therefore, we should keep this way
of framing tax policies in mind when considering the effects of new proposals as well as existing
law.

33

Endnotes
Auerbach, Frenkel and Razin (1997), a paper on which the current one relies, does consider a range of
equivalences broader than the “international taxation” in its title suggests.

1

Taxing wages at the individual level, in the flat tax proposal, would have facilitated the imposition of a
progressive tax rate schedule on individual or household wage income, rather than the proportional one included
as part of a VAT.

2

3

For further discussion, see Kaplow (1994).

Whether government can improve risk-pooling depends on the extent to which efficient private markets for
sharing risks already exist, as well as on the extent to which individual risks are themselves correlated.

4

5 Saez et al. (2012) find that employer and employee payroll taxes have different incidence for a Greek tax reform
that affected different cohorts of employees differently, for which equal incidence would have required posted
wages to differ based on whether workers were subject to the tax reform.

A further equivalence here is between tax systems that provide a deduction for the nominal interest rate
multiplied by the undepreciated basis, as represented here, and those that permit a deduction for interest on the
share of debt used to finance the asset, 𝑑𝑑, and for the interest rate multiplied by the undepreciated basis net of
debt, (𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 − 𝑑𝑑). This latter approach is known as an “allowance for corporate equity,” or ACE (Institute for Fiscal
Studies 1991).
6

In the parlance of the investment literature, Tobin’s 𝑞𝑞 would exceed 1, as the firm’s value would equal the value
of its measured assets plus the present value of its above-normal returns. While expensing at the firm level would
be based on the cost of asset purchases, expensing at the individual level would be based on the higher value paid
for the firm.

7

To a lesser extent, the practice of adding up nominal effects on revenues over different years without discounting
has the effect of encouraging a shift of revenue losses to earlier years within the budget window, when nominal
magnitudes are smaller for any given ratio to GDP.

8

Taxpayers may also have an incentive to use the choice between EET- and TEE-based accounts to time their tax
bases for strategic reasons, if they expect the tax system to change over time. An individual who expects marginal
tax rates to rise, for example, will be more likely to opt for the TEE approach, beyond what would be needed to
accomplish a smoothing of his or her tax base across periods, in order to subject a greater share of lifetime income
to a lower marginal tax rate.

9

For example, if an asset appreciated substantially shortly after purchase, the use of an assumed constant annual
growth rate based on the ultimate sale price would leave the investor locked in, as holding the asset longer would
spread more of the large immediate gain over subsequent periods of lower rates of appreciation.

10

Note that, with no net share repurchases, this amounts to a tax on dividends. This equivalence between a
dividend tax and a cash-flow tax, and particularly the property that the dividend tax does not affect the after-tax
rate of return to investment, is a major element of the “new view” of dividend taxation (Auerbach 1979).

11

Note that the Lerner symmetry theorem may break down for other reasons, for example because of nominal
rigidities, which may not serve as advantages for the DBCFT. See Barbiero et al. (2018). In such circumstances, the
violation of other equivalences, for example leading the side of the market on which the tax is applied to matter,
will be relevant for implementation.

12

In terms of how this cash-flow tax on foreign-held assets would be effected, the border adjustment should lead
to an offsetting appreciation of the real exchange rate, through some combination of an increase in the domestic
price level or an appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. This real exchange rate appreciation reduces the real
value of cash flows on foreign assets. See Auerbach et al. (2017). Several factors could influence the mix of
increases in domestic prices and the nominal exchange rate, including exchange rate policy and whether there
were a wage deduction on the employer side or a wage subsidy on employee side, in the presence of some
nominal wage rigidity.

13

As discussed in Auerbach et al. (2017), it would also be desirable to include a border adjustment for the financial
flows incorporated in 𝐸𝐸, to prevent firms from using related-party cross-border lending to shift profits.
