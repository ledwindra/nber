This paper examines the contributions to these relative wage movements of international trade and technical change.  We first measure trade as changes in product prices and technical change as TFP growth.  Then we relate price and TFP changes to a set of underlying factors.  Among a number of results, we find that changes in prices, not TFP, were the major force behind the rise in inequality in the 1980s.  We also find that although increased trade pressure has raised technical change, its effect on wage inequality was not quantitatively significant.\n\n",
