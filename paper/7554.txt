ABSTRACT
This paper

proposes a theory

of twin banking-currency crises in which both fundamentals arid

self-fulfilling beliefs play crucial roles. Fundamentals determine whether crises will occur. Selffulfilling beliefs determine when they occur. The fundamental that causes 'twin crises' is government

guarantees to domestic banks' foreign creditors. When these guarantees are in place twin crises
inevitably occur, but their timing is a multiple equilibrium phenomenon that depends on agents'
beliefs. So while self-fulfilling beliefs have an important role to play, twin crises do not happenjust

anywhere. They happen in countries where there are fundamental problems - problems such as
guarantees to the financial sector.

1. Introduction
The past decade has witnessed dramatic collapses of fixed exchange rate regimes
in countries as diverse as Sweden, Mexico, Thailand and Korea. This has led to a
resurgence of interest in the causes of currency crises. While there is disagreement

about the source of these crises, there is widespread agreement that banking
crises have become increasingly linked to currency crises. This is the 'twin crises'
phenomenon emphasized by Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999).
This paper proposes a theory of such crises in which both fundamentals and

self-fulfilling beliefs play crucial roles.' Fundamentals determine whether crises

will occur. Self-fulfilling beliefs determine when they occur.2 The fundamental that causes 'twin crises' is government guarantees to domestic banks' foreign
creditors. When these guarantees are in place twin crises inevitably occur. But
their timing is a multiple equilibrium phenomenon that depends on agents' beliefs.
So while self-fulfilling beliefs have an important role to play, twin crises do not

happen just anywhere. They happen in countries where there are fundamental
problems, countries such as Sweden, Mexico, Thailand, and Korea.
In our model the government guarantees the repayment of bank's foreign loans

in the event of a devaluation. These guarantees lead banks to expose themselves
to exchange rate risk and to declare bankruptcy when a devaluation occurs. Con-

sequently, a devaluation transforms potential government liabilities into act'aal
liabilities. This transformation is the key mechanism by which government guar'The recent literature emphasizes the distinction between fundamental and multiple equilibrium explanations of twin crises.' For examples of papers that emphasize fundamentals see
Corsetti, Pesenti and Roubini (1997), Bordo and Schwartz (1998), and Burnside, Eichenbaum
and Rebelo (1998). For papers that stress the importance of multiple equilibrium considerations see, for example, Chang and Velasco (1997), Aghion, Bacchetta, and Banerjee (1999) and
Krugman (1999).

antees create the possibility of self-fulfilling currency crises. To understand our

basic argument, assume that there is a limit on the amount of reserves that the
government is willing to lose in defense of its currency. Now suppose that market participants believe that a devaluation is imminent and that the government
will finance bank bailouts, at least in part, via seignorage revenues. Then private
agents will exchange domestic money for foreign reserves to the point where the

fixed exchange rate regime is abandoned. The resulting devaluation leads banks
to declare bankruptcy and activates the government's obligations to foreign cred-

itors. As a consequence, the government will validate agents' expectations by
partially financing the bailout with seignorage revenues. Thus government guarantees trigger a self-fulfilling, rational run on the domestic currency, a devaluation

and a banking crisis. Paradoxically, government guarantees make banks and the
economy less stable, not more stable.

How can the government prevent these self-fulfilling twin crises? The two
moSt obvious routes are: eliminate government guarantees or (somehow) credibly
commit to financing post-devaluation bank bailouts without recourse to seignorage

revenues. Our analysis suggests a third route related to a recent proposal by
Feldstein (1999): the government must obtain and be willing to use a 'sufficient'

amount of reserves to fend off a speculative attack. But what does 'sufficient'
mean? In our model it means a fraction of the money supply that is an increasing

function of the inflation rate that would result if a speculative attack succeeded.
Finally, we analyze a fourth possibility: imposing a state contingent Tobin tax on

exchange rate transactions.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a model
of a small open economy which is populated by four different sets of agents: banks,

firms, households, and a government. The banking sector is a simplified version

of the one in Burnside, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (1999). Banks borrow dollars
2

from abroad and make loans to domestic firms. By assumption these domestic
loans are denominated in local currency, so that banks face foreign exchange rate

risk. This risk can be hedged in forward currency markets. We characterize
banks' optimal hedging strategy when the government guarantees that foreign
creditors will be repaid in the event of a devaluation. In addition we consider
the case in which these guarantees are absent. Firms borrow funds to hire labor

and produce output using a constant returns to scale technology. Households
supply labor inelastically and derive utility from consumption and domestic real

balances. Because they have access to international capital markets they have
a non-trivial forward looking portfolio problem. In particular, the amount of
domestic real balances that they hold depends on their beliefs about the longevity
of the fixed exchange rate regime. The government faces an intertemporal budget

constraint which must hold for every realization of the state of the economy. To

simplify the analysis we assume, as in Krugman (1979), that the government
follows a threshold rule according to which it abandons fixed exchange rates when

its reserves reach a certain lower bound.

The only source of uncertainty in this economy is agents' beliefs about the
collapse of the fixed exchange rate regime. We model these beliefs by assuming
that agents coordinate on an exogenous signal which takes on the value one with
probability q and zero with probability (1 — q). When the signal equals one agents

believe that the exchange rate regime will collapse before the end of the period.

When it equals zero, they believe that the fixed exchange rate will persist for at
least one more period.
Section 3 displays the competitive equilibrium when self-fulfilling speculative

attacks are ruled out by assumption. Section 4 analyzes the conditions under
which these attacks can occur. Section 5 contains concluding remarks.

2. The Basic Model
We consider a simple general equilibrium model of a small open economy. By
assumption there is a single consumption good and no barriers to trade, so that
purchasing power parity holds:

Pt =SP.

(2.1)

Here Pt and P denote the domestic and foreign price level respectively, while St
denotes the exchange rate defined as units of domestic currency per unit of foreign

currency. For convenience we normalize the foreign price level to one: P1 = 1 for

allt.
The economy is initially in a fixed exchange rate regime with St

5'. To

allow for the possibility of a self-fulfilling speculative attack, we suppose that
agents coordinate on some signal, observed at the beginning of each period. The
signal takes on the values zero or one with probabilities 1 — q and q, respectively.
When the signal is equal to zero, agents believe that the fixed exchange rate will

endure for at least one more period. If the signal equals one, then agents believe
the fixed exchange rate regime will collapse before the end of the period, with the

exchange rate initially depreciating to an endogenously determined value SD and

then depreciating at the rate 7 per unit of time.
The key question is whether agents' beliefs about a devaluation can be selffulfilling. We denote by T the random time of a (possible) self-fulfilling speculative

attack. It is useful to distinguish between three types of time periods in the life
of our model economy.

• Fixed Exchange Rate Regime: here S = 5' for all t <T and the supply of
money is determined by the central bank's need to fix the nominal exchange

rate.
4

• Devaluation Period: this is the time period T in which the fixed exchange

rate is abandoned. To simplify our analysis, we adopt the standard assumption of the speculative attack literature regarding the behavior of the
monetary authority.3 Specifically, we assume that the central bank defends

the fixed exchange rate I by selling its reserves at that price until reserves
fall by an amount x Once this happens, the central bank floats the exchange
rate, and allows the money supply to grow at the rate 'y forever.

• Floating Exchange Rate Regime: this obtains for all t > T. The growth
rate of money is equal to . We consider two separate cases. In the first
case the government does not change its tax and spending policy in the
aftermath of the devaluation. Here 'y is endogenously determined by the
magnitude of the bank bailout and the government's intertemporal budget

constraint. In the second case 'y is given exogenously and taxes adjust so
that the government's intertemporal budget constraint holds.
The economy is populated by four sets of agents: perfectly competitive banks,
good producing firms, households, and a government. In the following subsection
we provide a detailed analysis of the banking sector. We then discuss the problems

of the other agents in the economy.

2.1. The Banking Sector
In this subsection we analyze a simplified version of the banking model in Burnside, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (1999) in which banks are exposed to exchange rate

risk. The focus of our analysis is on banks' optimal hedging strategies when the
economy is operating under the fixed exchange rate regime discussed above, i.e.

at time t < T. We show that: (i) it is optimal for a bank to fully hedge exchange
3See, for example, Krugman (1979) and Flood and Garber (1984).
5

rate risk when there are no government guarantees to foreign creditors; and (ii)
it is not optimal for a bank to hedge exchange rate risk in the presence of govern-

ment guarantees. In the latter case, it is optimal for banks to declare bankruptcy

when the currency is devalued. The optimal hedging strategy has the property
that when a bank declares bankruptcy, its residual value, net of bankruptcy costs
is zero.

We assume that banks are perfectly competitive and their actions are publicly

observable. Individual banks borrow foreign currency at a gross interest rate Rb,

issue non-indexed loans to domestic firms. These loans to firms are to be
repaid in local currency units at a gross interest rate R. When firms repay these
and

loans, the exchange rate S is either S' or SD, depending on whether the fixed
exchange rate regime has been abandoned.

To simplify the analysis we assume that banks do not borrow funds from
domestic residents. Instead banks finance themselves entirely by borrowing L
dollars in the international capital market. These funds are converted into units
of local currency at the prevailing exchange rate, S'. Banks can hedge exchange
rate risk by entering into forward contracts. Let F denote the one-period forward

exchange rate defined as units of local currency per dollar. By assumption these
contracts are priced in a risk neutral manner, so that:
1

1

1

(2.2)

This condition states that the expected real rate of return of purchasing a forward
contract, denominated in units of the consumption good, is equal to zero. Relation

(2.2) implies that forward contracts make a profit in the devaluation state since
> 5'. To lend L dollars, banks must incur transactions costs of 5L. Dollardenominated profits from these loans are:

6

L(8 Rb) =

RaSIL

—

RbL — öL.

Dollar-denominated profits from hedging activities are given by:

( - ).

(2.3)

it(S) = itL(S) + itH(s)

(2.4)

=x

Here x denotes the number of units of local currency sold by the bank in the
forward market. We assume that there is full information about the values of L
and x chosen by the banks. Notice that the expected value of the bank's profits
from hedging is E(rr") = 0. Total dollar-denominated profits, it, are given by

Banks can default on loans contracted in the international capital market. It
is optimal for banks to default in states of the world where iv is negative. The
expected profit of a bank that defaults whenever it(S) < 0 is

V = (1— q)max{iv(S'),O} +qmax{iv(SD),0}.

(2.5)

When a bank defaults it has gross assets with a residual value given by

VR(S)=

RaSIL

1

1

-öL+x(-).

(2.6)

These assets, net of bankruptcy costs, are distributed to the bank's international
creditors. We assume that bankruptcy costs are given by wL, where w > 0.
In the Appendix we show that the bank's expected profit can be expressed as:

v=

(Ra

L — ECB(x, L)

—

(2.7)

where ECB, the expected cost of borrowing, is given by,

ECB(x, L) = Pr(no default) x RbL + Pr(default) x VR.
7

(2.8)

Notice that in equation (2.7) xonly affects ECB(x,L). So for any given L, it is
optimal for a bank to choose x in order to minimize ECB(x, L).

We consider two scenarios. In the first scenario there are no government
guarantees to foreign creditors. If banks default foreign creditors receive the
residual value of the bank net of bankruptcy costs, yR — wL. We assume that
there is no default on forward contracts—these contracts must be settled before
the bank's foreign creditors are paid. This implies that if the bank defaults, its
residual value must be sufficiently large to pay its bankruptcy costs: VR(S) wL
for all (x, L) such that VR(S) < RL. Using (2.6) this condition can be written
as

RaSL — 6L
1
1
____
+ x( — )

> wL.

(2.9)

For a given value of L, this imposes finite upper and lower bounds on the value
of x that an individual bank can choose.

In the second scenario the government guarantees foreign creditors against

default by domestic banks, up to a repayment limit of RL. Here R denotes
the exogenously given risk free interest rate in international capital markets. No
default on forward contracts continues to require VR(S) wL.
No Government Guarantees

Absent government guarantees, R' is determined by the condition that the
expected return to international creditors equals R:

RL = Pr(no default) x RbL + Pr(default) x (V' — wL)

(2.10)

Proposition 1 In an economy with no guarantees and w > 0, it is optimal for
banks to fully hedge exchange rate risk. When w = 0, the Modigliani-Miller
theorem applies and the bank is indifferent between hedging and not hedging.
Proof: See the Appendix.
8

To see the basic intuition behind this proposition note that using (2.8), we can
write (2.10) as:

RL = ECB(x, L) — Pr(default) x wL,
so that

ECB(x, L) = RL + Pr(default) x wL.
The bank can avoid paying bankruptcy costs by choosing x so that 7r(S) > 0 for
all S. This strategy is optimal because it minimizes ECB(x, L). This establishes
that full hedging is optimal for a bank in the absence of government guarantees,

so that banks never go bankrupt.
For future reference it is useful to note that given a full hedging strategy, the
bank's first order condition for L is:

RS1

=R+ö.

(2.11)

This expression equates theexpected real return to lending to the real cost of
borrowing (R) plus the marginal cost of producing a loan (5).
Government Gnarantees
In the presence of government guarantees Rb is given by:

RL =

Pr(no default) x RbL + Pr(default when S 5') x (VR — wL) +

Pr(default when S = 5D) x max{VR — wL, RL}

(2.12)

Proposition 2 Consider an economy in which the government guarantees the
repayment of bank's foreign loans in the event of a devaluation. Suppose that
w < R. Then fully hedging is not optimal and the optimal strategy is to set x to
its lowest permissible value.

Proof: See the Appendix.
9

The intuition underlying Proposition 2 can be seen as follows. A bank whose

(x, L) is such that it defaults only in the devaluation state (S = SD), can borrow
at the risk free rate: Rb = R. This fact and (2.8) imply that

ECB(x, L) = (1 — q)RL + qVR(SD).

(2.13)

Consider a bank that decided to default in the devaluation state. Its optimal
strategy is to choose x to minimize ECB(x, L), defined in (2.13). This requires

setting x to its lowest feasible value: VR(SD) = wL. It follows that when the
bank pursues this strategy,

ECB(x,L) = (1—q)RL+qwL.
In contrast, suppose that the bank chooses a hedging strategy such that it is never

optimal to default. Then Rb = R, and

ECB(x,L) = RL.
It immediately follows that, as long as q is positive and w < R, the optimal
strategy for a bank is the first one, namely set x to its lowest feasible bound and
default whenever the devaluation state occurs. Following an argument similar to

that used in the proof of Proposition 1, one can show that it is not optimal to
default in the no-devaluation state, since government guarantees do not apply in
that state.
Note that the optimal value of x can be negative, so that banks make hedging

profits during the fixed exchange regime and lose money when the currency is
devalued. It is the latter feature that allows them to minimize their residual value
in bankruptcy states, so that VR(SD) = wL. As a consequence, there are no
assets, after bankruptcy costs, for the government to seize in order to offset their
liabilities to banks' foreign creditors.
10

It is useful to note, for future reference, that given the bank's optimal hedging

strategy when there are government guarantees, its first order condition forL is:
RaSI

F

= (1 — q)R + + qw.

(2.14)

This expression equates the expected real return to lending to the real cost of
borrowing plus the marginal cost of producing a loan. The term qw reflects the
fact that the bank pays bankruptcy costs, proportional to is total lending, with
probability q.

2.2. The Firm's Problem
Output (y) is produced by perfectly competitive firms which use labor (h) accord-

ing to the technology y = Ah. Firms pay the real wage rate w which is set at
the beginning of the period, prior to the realization of the exchange rate. Wage
payments are in units of the local currency.4 Firms must borrow their wage bill
from the banks at the gross interest rate R, so their expected profits are given
by Ah — Rawh. The first order condition for h is:

w = A/Ra.

(2.15)

2.3. The Household Problem
The representative household inelastically supplies one unit of labor in each period

and maximizes expected lifetime utility, which dependson consumption (Ct) and
real balances (Mt/St):

U = E0 /3t[logc

+ log(M/St)],

0 </3 < 1.

(2.16)

4Firms must hedge against the risk of a devaluation to ensure that they can pay the agreed
upon real wage rate. The details of the required hedging strategy are discussed in the Appendix.

11

To abstract from trends in the economy's current account we assume that 3 =
R-1. The sequential budget constraint faced by the household depends on the

time period under consideration. During floating exchange rate periods (t > T)
it is given by:

at+i = Rat +Wt +t

—r — ct — (M+i —M)/S.

(2.17)

The variable at represents beginning of period t net foreign assets, ivI represents
beginning of period t nominal money balances, Wt is real labor income, r represents constant lump-sum taxes, and rr are the firm's profits.5
In the devaluation period (t T) the household's sequential budget constraint
is given by:

aT+1=RaT+wT+7rT—1-—cT—

h/i
1\
SD +x+xTy_-j

MT+lM'

MD = MT —

(2.18)
(2.19)

At the time of the devaluation the household redeems xS' units of local currency
in exchange for foreign reserves. This is why its initial money holdings in (2.18)

equal MD, defined in (2.19), and the term x appears as an asset. The variable 4
denotes the number of units of local currency sold by the household in the forward

market in the previous period. The household has an incentive to enter these
contracts during the fixed exchange rate regime. By entering the forward market
it can insure against the effect of a devaluation on the value of its real balances.

We will see later that allowing households to hedge implies that consumption is
constant over time. This greatly simplifies the analysis, enabling us to characterize

analytically the equilibrium of the economy.

During the fixed exchange regime (t <T) the budget constraint is:

where a0 and M0 are given.

Finally we impose the no-Ponzi game condition: E0 lim_. at+i/Rt = 0.

2.4. The Government
During the fixed exchange rate regime (t < T) the government's flow budget
constraint is:

ft+i = Rft + (M1 —

+ r — g.

(2.21)

Here ft denotes the government's net foreign assets at the beginning of the time
period, g is the constant level of real government purchases and M? denotes the

endogenous level of the money suppiy that is consistent with a fixed exchange
rate regime at time t. Not surprisingly, M8 is constant for t < T.
The government's flow budget cOnstraint during the devaluation period (t = T)
is:

(2.22)

Here, F represents the cost of honoring guarantees to bank's foreign creditors.
From Proposition 2 we know that F = RL. To simplify, we assume that the
government repays F in the devaluation period T.

During the floating exchange rate period the government's flow budget constraint is:

ft+i = Rft + (M1 — M)/S + r — g.

(2.23)

We impose the condition:

E0t-4
urn ft+i/Rt = 0.

(2.24)

Note that once the fixed exchange rate is abandoned, there is no uncertainty

in the economy. This fact together with equations (2.22), (2.23) and (2.24) imply

13

This equation simply says that seignorage revenues must equal the value of the
bailout, F, plus the loss of reserves incurred during the attack.

2.5. The Competitive Equilibrium
We conclude this section with a definition of the competitive equilibrium that
applies to economies with and without government guarantees to foreign creditors.

Definition A competitive equilibrium for this economy is a set of stochastic processes for quantities {Ct, xt, x,

M, M,at+i, ft+i, F, h, L} and prices {wt, R, R,

Pt, S, F} such that: (i) ct, x, M+1, at+i solve the household's problem given the
stochastic process for prices; (ii) the government's intertemporal budget constraint
(2.21) - (2.25) holds; (iii) the money market clears with M5 = Mt; (iv) the loan

market clears with L = wtht; and (v) the labor market clears with h =

1.

3. A Sustainable Fixed Exchange Rate Regime
In this section we describe a version of our economy in which self-fulfilling cur-

rency attacks are ruled out by assumption. The purpose is to demonstrate that
there exists a sustainable equilibrium with a fixed exchange rate. The existence
of this equilibrium follows from two basic assumptions: (i) agents assign probability zero to a devaluation, so that there is no uncertainty in the economy; (ii)
the government does not require seignorage revenues to satisfy its intertemporal

budget constraint.
Since there is no exchange rate uncertainty banks can borrow from foreigners
at the risk free rate, Rb = R. Absent the possibility of a devaluation, government
14

guarantees are irrelevant, so that F =

= = 0.

Also, hedging plays no role in the

F=S'.
It follows from (2.11) that:

In addition, equation (2.15) implies that the market clearing real wage rate is
given by:

w=A/(R+5).
This completes the description of the equilibrium prices.
To determine the household's consumption and real balances we write its value
function as:

V(at, M) =

max

{logct + log(M/S') + /3V(at+i, M+1)}

subject to (2.17). The first order conditions for this problem are:
1/ct

=

1/ct =

/3

M+1/S')'

/3R/ct+i.

Our assumption that /3 = R1 implies that consumption and money holdings
are constant over time. Using this fact, iterating on (2.17) and imposing the
transversality condition lim+ /3tat+i/ct+l = 0, we obtain that net foreign assets
are constant over time. In addition we find that:
Ct

= (R—1)ao+w—,

at =

a0,

= M/S' = /3c/(1 - /3).
15

(3.1)
(3.2)
(3.3)

Here we have used the fact that firms' profits are zero in equilibrium.
Since real balances are constant and the inflation rate is zero, the government
collects no seignorage revenues. Consequently, its intertemporal budget constraint
is given by:
(R —

l)f0 = 9 — T.

(3.4)

By construction, this analysis demonstrates that there is a unique fixed exchange
rate competitive equilibrium with Ct, at and Af constant over time, given by (3.1)—

(3.3). In addition ft is constant: ft = fo. This completes the description of the
equilibrium quantities.
Throughout the paper we assume that (3.4) holds, so that, in the absence of

self-fulfilling speculative attacks, the fixed exchange rate regime is sustainable.

Combining the government and household budget constraints and using the

fact that ct, at, ft and M are constant over time, we can express the economy's
aggregate resource constraint as

R+8-1

c+g=(R—1)(ao+fo)—A R+6 +A.

(3.5)

Notice that the first term on the right hand side is net interest on foreign assets.
The second term is the real cost of intermediation. The latter reflects the physical

costs of producing loans and the interest rate costs incurred because domestic
banks borrow funds from abroad.6 Since employment is normalized to 1, total
output, the last term, is equal to A.

6Banks borrow w = A/(R+6) dollars abroad. They use 5A/(R+) units of output to produce

these loans. At the end of the period they repay foreigners at a net cost of (R — 1)A/(R + 6).
Thus, the total cost of intermediation is (R + 6 — 1)A/(R + 6).

4. Self-Fulfilling Currency Attacks
In this section we turn to the question: Can self-fulfilling speculative attacks occur
in an economy with government guarantees? To answer this question we begin by

assuming that such an attack can exist. We then construct candidate equilibrium
price and quantity allocations for the three types of time periods in our model. By

construction these allocations satisfy the optimization problems of the different
agents in the model and the market clearing conditions. The key condition that

must be verified is whether S'/S' > 1, i.e. the exchange rate actually devalues
in the proposed equilibrium. Whether or not this is true depends on the nature
of monetary and fiscal policy after the devaluation. Here we consider two cases.

First, we analyze the 'no fiscal reform' case. Here the government finances the
costs associated with a devaluation entirely via seignorage revenues. For the sake
of simplicity we confine ourselves to an endogenously determined constant growth

rate of money. Proposition 3 establishes that, subject to a regularity condition,
self-fulfilling speculative attacks will occur. Second, we analyze the 'fiscal reform'

case. Here the government commits to expanding the growth rate of money at an

exogenous rate 'y and adjusts lump sum taxes to fulfill its intertemporal budget
constraint. Proposition 4 provides conditions on the quantity of reserves that the

government is prepared to lose, the growth rate of money, and the size of the
bailout for which a self-fulfilling attack will occur.

We solve our model in three stages. First we study the floating exchange rate
regime. Then, we analyze the fixed exchange rate regime. Finally, we consider the

devaluation period. Below we summarize the key features of the economy during
the different time periods, assuming that a self-fulfilling speculative attack exists.

Throughout our discussion we use the fact, proved in the Appendix, that

17

consumption, ct, and the household's real assets at are constant for all t:

c= (R- 1)(a+f')

(R- 1)wI+qwF_q(R_

(4.1)

Here w1 denotes the real wage rate during the fixed exchange rate period and the
period in which the devaluation occurs, while w' denotes the real wage rate during

the floating exchange rate period. The fact that Ct and at are constant hinges
on our assumption that during the fixed exchange rate period households hedge
exchange rate risk through forward contracts. According to (4.1), consumption
is equal to the household's permanent income, where the latter is defined to
take account of the annuitized expected present value of the bank bailout, q(R —
1)F/(R

— 1

+ q).

4.1. The Floating Exchange Rate Regime (t T + 1)
With no exchange rate uncertainty, banks can borrow from foreigners at the risk

free rate, Rb = R. The presence of guarantees is irrelevant and hedging plays
no role in the analysis, so Xt = = 0. Firms earn zero profits in each period.
Finally, the forward rate coincides with the spot rate, so F = S,1 and F/S = 'y.
The law of motion for the exchange rate and the money supply are:

S = S)7t_T,tT
M Myt_T, t T

(4.2)

Recall that SD is the exchange rate that prevails when the government abandons

the fixed exchange rate in period T. The variable MD represents the level of the
money supply after the speculative attack.
The banks' first order condition for L during the floating exchange rate regime
implies:
(4.3)
18

while equation (2.15) implies that the market clearing real wage rate is given by

wF=A/[(R+o)].
During the floating exchange rate regime expected inflation is constant and
equal to -y — 1. The demand for real balances is given by:

=

=

— 1).

(4.4)

Relation (4.4) implies that real balances are a decreasing function of the nominal

interest rate since the latter equals 'y/3 —

1

during the flexible exchange rate

regime.

4.2. The Fixed Exchange Rate Regime (t <T)
At any time period t <T there is exchange rate uncertainty, since a devaluation
may occur next period with probability q. In the presence of government guarantees banks behave as described in Proposition 2 and Rb = R. In addition, banks
set Xt to the lowest value consistent with (2.9). The exchange rate is equal to S'

and the forward rate is given by (2.2). Denote the inflation rate between time t
and t + 1 by rt. Then, the time t equilibrium interest rate at which banks lend
to firms, given by (2.14), can be written as
—

E[1/(1 +

)]

(45)

+ rrt)] = (1 — q) + qSI/SD. The numerator of (4.5) reflects the fact
that the bank only pays off its loans if there is no devaluation, a state that occurs
where E[1/(1

with probability (1 — q). If we were to make the approximation (which we don't)

E(1 +lTt), then we would obtain a version of the Fisher
equation for the nominal interest rate, Ra = E(1 + rrt)[(1 — q)R + 6 + qw].
Real wages are given by the firm's first order condition, (2.15):
that 1/{E[1/(1 —i--irt)]}

w1 = A/Ra.

(4.6)

In the Appendix we show that the solution to the household problem yields a
constant value for i which satisfies:

I+xh(---i)= wI +7rD+xh(1 )\ R

wI +7r

R—1

1F
- R—1
R F+w
(4.7)

The left hand side of (4.7) denotes the household's income in non-devaluation

states. The term xh(1/F — 1/S') is the loss associated with forward contracts in
those states of the world. The first term on the right hand side is the annuity
value of labor income, firm profits and forward contract profits in the devaluation

period. The second term is the annuity value of the bailout. Finally, the third term
is the constant wage rate in the floating exchange rate period (profits are equal to

zero under floating exchange rates). By choosing this value of x1l the household

can perfectly smooth consumption across the devaluation and non-devaluation
states of the world.
During the fixed exchange rate regime expected inflation is constant and equal
to q(SD/SI — 1). In the Appendix we show that households choose real balances

so that
m1 =

1—+q(1 _SI/SD)

(4.8)

Note that real balances are decreasing in expected inflation. During this regime
the endogenous money supply must be consistent with the real balances demanded

by households and the fixed exchange rate. Therefore M5' = S'rn' for all t <T.

4.3. The Devaluation Period (t = T)
At the beginning of period T, prior to the realization of the stochastic process signalling the onset of a devaluation, banks borrow from abroad and lend to domestic

firms at the value of R that prevails in the fixed exchange rate regime. Proposition 2 implies that, in an economy with government guarantees, once the currency
20

is devalued the banks renege on their foreign debt and declare bankruptcy. Due

to the banks' hedging strategy, their residual value, net of bankruptcy costs, is
equal to zero. Thus the total realized liability of the government, F, is RL.
Since firms make their hiring decisions at the beginning of the period prior to
the devaluation, the real wage is the same as in the fixed exchange rate regime
and is given by (4.6).
Recall that households enter the period with MT = rn'S' units of the local
currency. Once the random variable signaling the onset of a devaluation is realized,

agents redeem S' units of local currency in exchange for foreign reserves. The
exchange rate rises from 51 to 5D, at which point agents are left holding MD =
— S1 units of local currency. In the Appendix we prove the following lemma

which reflects our assumption that money grows at the rate 'y starting from the
level 11[D (see equation 4.2).

Lemma The rate of inflation from the onset of the devaluation to the first period

of the floating exchange rate regime (T + 1) is: ST+l/SD = 'y. The level of real
balances at the onset of the devaluation is:
/rD

SD

—mF

c

49

Integrating over the previous results we have constructed all of the endogenous

variables in an equilibrium where a self-fulfilling currency attack occurs at the
random date T as a function of three unknowns: ,y, SD and rn'. We now solve
for these three variables and verify whether 5D exceeds S, i.e. whether a selffulfilling currency attack actually occurs at T.
No Fiscal Reform
We first consider the case in which there is no fiscal reform, i.e. the government

finances all of the costs associated with a devaluation via seignorage revenues.
21

Proposition 3 Suppose that in the event of a devaluation the government chooses

y so that the present value of government liabilities after a devaluation, F + x
is

fully financed by seignorage. Then, as long as F > 0 and F + x is smaller,
for some q > 0, than the maximum present value of seignorage, cs/(R — 1), a
self-fulfilling speculative attack exists. Here cs denotes the level of consumption
in the sustainable fixed exchange rate equilibrium, defined in (3.5).
Proof: See the Appendix.

The previous proposition implies that as long as there are government guarantees and it is feasible to finance the obligations associated with the devaluation
via seignorage, a self-fulfilling speculative attack will almost surely occur. The
basic intuition for this is that with government guarantees a devaluation transforms potential liabilities into actual liabilities. If forward, looking agents believe

that these liabilities are financed via seignorage, they will reduce their domestic money holdings, exchanging them for foreign reserves. Given our assumptions
this triggers the government threshold rule for abandoning the fixed exchange rate
regime. At this point, the banks declare bankruptcy, which forces the government

to payoff foreign creditors. This, in turn, rationalizes the private agents' beliefs
about monetary policy and inflation that generated the crisis to begin with.
Under the assumptions of Proposition 3, this is true regardless of the reserves
that the government is willing to spend in defense of the currency, x The reason
for this is that the higher x is, the higher are the government's losses during the

speculative attack and the more seignorage that needs to be collected after the
fixed exchange rate regime is abandoned.

To understand the regularity condition F + x < cs/(R — 1), the right hand
side of this inequality equals the maximal present value of seignorage that the
government can extract from the economy. Using (4.4) and (4.9) it is straightforward to show that, for a given value of , the present value of seignorage is given
22

—
— 1)]. It follows that seignorage is strictly increasing
by c(7 —
in with maximal value equal to c/(R — 1) corresponding to 'y = cxD. In the

Appendix we show that CS iS an upper bound on the equilibrium value of c that is

attained in the limit, for arbitrarily small q; hence the upper bound on seignorage

is cs/(R

1). In order for a self-fulfilling currency attack to occur in the no
fiscal reform' case, it is necessary and sufficient that F + be smaller than the
maximum present value of seignorage. The reason this condition is necessary is
that agents are expecting that the costs associated with a devaluation, F + x
will be fully financed with seignorage. Obviously, if this is not possible, such an
expectation cannot be self-fulfilling.

Fiscal Reform

We now turn to the case in which the devaluation is accompanied by a fiscal
reform. Specifically, we assume that the law of motion for money is given by (4.4)
where

is now an exogenous parameter. Since the government's intertemporal

budget constraint does not hold for an arbitrary 7, we suppose that a devaluation
is followed by a fiscal reform in which lump sum taxes are adjusted to ensure that

the intertemporal budget constraint, (2.25), holds. The following proposition
characterizes the necessary and sufficient conditions for a self-fulfilling currency

attack to occur under these circumstances.
Proposition 4 Suppose that in the event of a devaluation the government finances
the present value of government obligations associated with the devaluation, F+X,

by choosing a fixed value of 'y and financing the remainder with post devaluation

taxes, )•

Then a self-fulfilling speculative attack exists if:

xms

(4.10)

where ms, defined in (3.3), is the level of real balances in a sustainable fixed
23

exchange rate regime (q = 0). The value of rD is given by:

yDX+F/l

(4.11)

Proof: See the Appendix.

According to (4.10) the government must be able to buy more than a fraction
(y — 1)/(7 — 3) of the real balances in a sustainable fixed exchange rate regime

to avoid a self-fulfilling speculative attack. Note that if the government sets

to infinity the right hand side of (4.10) converges to rn5. So, in this case the
government must be able to buy back all outstanding real balances to avoid a
speculative attack. Finally, if the government can credibly commit to not using
seignorage revenues to finance an eventual bank bailout (i.e. it sets to one),
then self-fulfilling speculative attacks do not exist. We elaborate on this point
below.

5. Policy Implications
How can a government eliminate self-fulfilling currency attacks? Our model sug-

gests four possibilities: (i) eliminate government guarantees; (ii) obtain a high
enough level of reserves, that in combination with a credible partial fiscal reform
will allow the government to successfully fend off a speculative attack; (iii) impose a tax on purchases of foreign currency in the event that a speculative attack

occurs, and (iv) get someone else to pay for the bank bailouts. We discuss each
of these in turn.

24

Eliminating Government Guarantees

In practice there may be many reasons for governments to provide guarantees to banking systems. Propositions 3 and 4 make concrete one cost of doing
this. These propositions show, under assumptions of our model, that absent these
guarantees self-fulfilling currency attacks do not exist.

Proposition 5 Suppose that there are no government guarantees to bank's foreign creditors. In addition, suppose that agents believe that in the event of a
devaluation taxes and government spending remain constant, while the growth
rate of money, y, is constant. Then, self-fulfilling speculative attacks do not exist.

Proof: See the Appendix.

The basic idea used in our proof is that absent government guarantees F = 0.
So, if a self-fulfilling currency attack succeeded, the government's liabilities would

increase only by x which is the loss of reserves at the time of the attack. Since
the government's intertemporal budget constraint held prior to the attack, this
means that the value of seignorage revenues associated with a particular value of
'y would have to exactly equal x in equilibrium. Under the assumptions of our
model this is not possible unless SI/SD

1.

Proposition 5 does not rule out the existence of self-fulfilling speculative at-

tacks for more complicated paths of the money supply after the devaluation,
or different money demand formulations.7 Still, the proposition establishes the
presumption that eliminating guarantees makes the possibility of self-fulfilling
speculative attacks less likely.
Reserves and Fiscal Reforms

An implication of Proposition 4 is that a self-fulfilling attack can be avoided if
the government credibly commits to raising taxes by the amount 'rD and is willing
7Results in Obstfeld (1986) suggest that such self-fulfilling attacks are possible.

25

to spend an amount of reserves that exceeds ms(7 — l)/('y — 3). This formalizes a

point stressed by Feldstein (1999) and others: having access and being able to use

reserves to fend off a speculative attack, can eliminate the possibility of attacks.
However, committing reserves is useful only if the government is also committed to

an associated fiscal reform. In the limit, if the government can somehow credibly

commit to completely paying its post devaluation liabilities with a fiscal reform,
then the level of reserves is actually irrelevant. Under these circumstances, 'y = 1,
the right hand side of (4.10) is zero and any positive amount of reserves forecloses

the possibility of a self-fulfilling speculative attack.
Tobin Taxes

Recall that agents in our model coordinate on a signal that takes on the value

one (which is associated with a devaluation) with probability q. Suppose that
there are government guarantees but the government is not committed to a fiscal
reform of the type described in Proposition 4. Instead, the government commits
to taxing foreign exchange transactions at the rate 0. So, if a successful attack
occurs, the government will obtain tax revenues of 0x This revenue, together
with seignorage revenues, must totally finance the liabilities associated with a
devaluation.

This simple Tobin tax has two effects. First, it alleviates the need to use
seignorage revenues to finance the liabilities associated with a devaluation. In the
case where these revenues can finance the entire bank bailout (0x

F), the Tobin

tax amounts to a fiscal reform of such magnitude that seignorage revenues are not

required to finance the costs associated with a devaluation. Thus, a devaluation
does not occur.8 We view this condition as unlikely to ever hold in practice, since
it would require either huge values of x or prohibitive values for •
8See

the introduction to the proofs of Propositions 3—5 in the Appendix.

26

Second, the Tobin tax affects the incentives of private agents to trade local cur-

rency for foreign reserves. The after-tax profit to a private agent from converting
a unit of local currency into reserves in the devaluation period is (1—0 — SI/SD).
Obviously, if 9 is such that 1 — 0 — 51/5D <0 agents will not attack the currency.

The actual value of 0 required to rule out a speculative attack depends on all the

determinants of 5D, such as y. For every y there exists an 5D, and therefore a
0, that would rule out the attack. So in principle such a tax could be used to
eliminate self-fulfilling currency attacks. But one obvious problem with the tax
is its state contingent nature. Just what signal needs to be credibly observed to
declare that a speculative attack is self-fulfilling in nature?
An External Bailout

A final strategy for eliminating self-fulfilling speculative attacks is to gain
access to an external entity that covers the costs of a bailout, F, if a speculative
attack ever occurs. This guarantees that the government does not have to collect
seignorage revenues, thus eliminating the possibility of self-fulfilling speculative
attacks. Since no attacks happen in equilibrium the lender of last resort never has

to intervene. Even though this strategy works in the context of our model we are
deeply skeptical about its real world applicability. In our model the only margin
that banks can use to take advantage of the implicit government guarantees is to
expose themselves to exchange rate risk. In practice banks can exploit the presence

of guarantees using other margins (e.g. investing in risky real estate ventures). In
the presence of these additional margins a lender of last resort would create the
moral hazard problems discussed by Calomiris (1998), Chari and Kehoe (1998),
Mishkin (1999) and others.

27

6. Conclusion
This paper developed a theory of 'twin crises' in which both fundamentals and self-

fulfilling beliefs play an important role. The presence of government guarantees
to banks' foreign creditors implies that a 'twin crisis' will inevitably occur. In
this sense fundamentals matter. This makes us optimistic about the prospect of
identifying countries in which crises will occur. However, the timing of the crises
in our model depends subtly on agent's self-fulfilling beliefs about when the fixed

exchange rate regime will collapse. This makes us pessimistic about the prospect
of forecasting the precise time at which 'twin crises' will occur.

A. Appendix
A.1. The Banking Sector
We first establish that under the fixed exchange rate regime the objective function
of the representative bank, (2.5), can always be rewritten as

V(x,L) = E(VR)(L) — ECB(x,L)
Informally, ECB(x, L)

is given by (2.8). Formally, it is equal to
Pr(S = s)min{RbL,VR(s)}.

ECB(x,L) =
sE{SI,SD}

From (2.6) we get VR(S) =
V

r (S) + RbL. It follows that from (2.5) we obtain

= (1 — q) max{VR(SI) — RbL, 0} +

q max{VR(SD)

—

RbL, 0}.

Notice that max{VR(S) — RbL,0} = VR(S) — min{RbL, VR(S)}.

So we have

V= E(VR) —(1 _q)min{RbL,VR(SI)} _qmin{RbL,VR(SD)}.

In what follows it is convenient to divide the set of feasible (x, L) pairs into 4
subsets:
1. (x, L) pairs such that the bank is fully hedged, and never defaults,
2. (x, L) pairs such that the bank defaults only when S = 5',
3. (x, L) pairs such that the bank defaults only when S = SD, and
4. (x, L) pairs such that the bank defaults in both states.

Proof of Proposition 1. We begin with the fact that (2.10) can be rewritten as
RL =

Pr(S =

(A.1)

for strategies 1—3 and ECB = E(VR) for strategy 4. This implies that fullhedging, when feasible, strictly dominates strategies 2 and 3, since wL > 0. Fullhedging is feasible whenever E(V') RL or R (F/S')(R + 6).
Suppose R > (F/s')(R + 6). This implies that full-hedging is feasible but
also that banks could make infinite profits by lending infinite amounts.

On the other hand, if R < (F/S')(R + 6) then E(VR) < RL so that fullhedging and strategy 4 are not feasible. Strategies 2 and 3 imply V <0.
This implies that the only possible equilibrium interest rate is R = (F/S') (R+
6). In this case full hedging is feasible at x = F(R + 6)L and E(VR) = RL, implying V = 0. As stated above, since full-hedging is feasible it strictly dominates
strategies 2 and 3. Strategy 4 is not feasible since E(VR) = RL.I

Proof of Proposition 2. Under guarantees, if there is default when S
foreign creditors receive max {VR(SD) — wL, RL}. Hence, for strategies 1—3, the

condition determining a bank's borrowing rate when there are guarantees can be
formally written as

A bank following strategy 4 faces the constraint that (1 — q)[VR(SI) — wL] +
RL. It follows that
q max{Vl(SD) —wL, RL}
1. full-hedging implies that Rb R and ECB = RL,

4. strategy 4 implies that ECB = E(V').
First, consider the possibility that the equilibrium interest rate is such that
R > (F/S') [(1 — q)R + 6 + qw]. It is easy to establish that in such circumstances,
banks following strategy 3 would be able to make infinite profits by lending infinite
amounts.
9Notice that under strategy 3, VR(SD) < RL, since otherwise we would have VR(SI) >
VR(SD) RL implying that the bank was fully-hedged. Hence (A.2) implies Rb = R.

31

Next, consider the possibility that the equilibrium interest rate is such that
R' < (F/S')[(l —q)R+6+qw]. It is easy to establish that in such circumstances,
full-hedging and defaulting in both states are not feasible strategies.'° Even if
feasible, strategy 2 implies V <0. If R < (F/S')[(1 — q)R + 6 + qw] strategy 3
implies V < 0.
Hence, the only possible equilibrium interest rate is R' = (F/S')[(l — q)R +
6+qw] with banks following strategy 3. Conditional on strategy 3, to minimize its
expected cost of borrowing, it is optimal for a bank to minimize VR(SD) subject

to the constraint that VR(SD) wL. Since 0VR(SD)/3x > 0, the bank will
choose the lowest x consistent with VR(SD) L, x = (w + 6 — RaSh/SD)L/(1 —
q)(1/SI_1/SD), implying VR(SD) = wL, VR(SI) = RL, ECB = (1—q)RL+qwL

and V=0.U

Firm profits, in dollar terms, are given by
7rf

(R — 1)d/S + xf(1/F — 1/S)

where h is the firm's demand for labor, w is the real wage rate, d is the number
of pesos borrowed by the firm from the bank, and x is the number of pesos sold
forward by the firm.
Firms maximize E(irj) = Ah — wh — (R — 1)d/F subject to the constraint
that they have sufficient pesos on hand to pay their wage bill in advance: Swh
= Fwh.
d + Sx1 (1/F — 1/S), for all S. The two constraints imply that d =
—
So E(7rf) = Ah Rawh. The firm's first order condition for labor is A = Raw.
Realized profits are given by 'irs = Ah(1 — F/S) with E(7r1) = 0.
'°Full-hedging is not feasible since E(VR) < RL. For VR(SD) — wL > RL the lending
condition for strategy 4 can be written as E(V') — wL RL, which would imply that the bank
was full hedged. For VR(SD) — wL < RL the condition can be written VR(SI) — wL RL.
Combining this with (constraint on VRSD) implies E(VR) > (1 —q)RL+wL, which is not true
given the condition on R.

the money supply rule M = M' for t < T, and MT+J = Y(MT — XST-1) for

Iterating forward on this equation, using the money suppiy rule, and imposing

1im 31Sl = 0,11 we obtain ST+j = YST for j 0, and ST = R(7 —

R( — )(M' — S')/c and 5' = R[1 — (1 — q)]/(c/M' + q/5D). Thus,
given MD = M' — xS1, we have MD/SD = c/(Ry — 1). We have proven the

Since the household does not know when the devaluation will take place, in every
period t in which the devaluation has not yet taken place, the household will set

A.4. Proofs of Propositions 3—5
We first provide some intuition for the propositions. To do this assume that there
exists a solution (c, m1, SI/SD, -y) to equations (A.33)—(A.36), with c > 0 and
1. Given c and 'y, we can plot rn1 as a function of SI/SD using (A.35) and

which is the result of substituting (A.36) into (A.34). We do this in Figure 1.
Equation (A.35) defines a curve with an intercept at qc/(R — 1 + q), which is
increasing, equals c/(R — 1) at S1/SD = 1 and has a vertical asymptote at
Equation (A.37) defines a curve which is decreasing, with a vertical
asymptote at 0, equal to ç5c/(R — 1) + r' — F at SI/SD, and with a horizontal
asymptote at m1 = x, as SI/SD
oc. It is clear from Figure 1 that when
1 + (R — 1)/q.

there are guarantees, so that F> 0, the equilibrium value of SI/SD < 1 as long
as D < F, as in Propositions 3 and 4. However, in the absence of guarantees,
F = 0, and with no fiscal reform, 1D = o, SI/SD = 1 as in Proposition 5. We
now establish that in each case there are solutions with c> 0 and 'y 1.

Proposition 4. We prove Proposition 4 first as we can take the post-devaluation
morley growth rate, 'y > 1, parametrically. Consider the four equations (A.33)—
(A.36). Let a = SI/SD. In the model with guarantees w' = A(1 — q + qa)/[(1 —
q)R + 6 + qw] and WF A/['y(R + 6)]. When there are government guarantees,
banks will go bankrupt in the devaluation state and the government will pay
F = RL = R(d/S') = RFw'/S' to the banks' foreign creditors. Hence, we define
the function F(q) = RA/[(1—q)R+6+qw] for q>O, and F(q) 0 for q = 0. For
convenience, we define the function F(q) = RA/[(1—q)R+6-+-qw] for 0 < q < 1, so
that t(o) = limoq F(q). This definition is useful because it equates the function
at q = 0 to its limit as q approaches 0 from above. I.e. F(0) = limo_q '(q) whereas
F(0) limoq F(q).
We rewrite (A.33) as c = c'(a;q) where

To show that there is an equilibrium with self-fulfilling attacks, we will demon-

strate that c'(a; q) = c2(a; q) > 0 for some a < 1 and q > 0. To do this we make
reference to Figure 2.
The first step in our proof is to characterize the curves c'(a; q) and c2(a; q).

The straight line is c'(a; q). It is clear from (A.38) that c(a; q) > 0 for q > 0.
We have limqo c'(a; q) = CS, Va, where CS 15 the level of consumption under the

It follows that c'(a; q) < CS for all q > 0. Furthermore it is straightforward to
show that c(a; q) < 0 for all a.
39

The curve in Figure 2 is c2(a; q). We note that c2(a; q) > 0 only for a >

(q) =

Also c2(1; q) = c2(1) = (/)(R — 1)(R — 1)/[R(7 — 1)] > 0. We have

Now that we have characterized c1 and c2 we conclude our proof. For fixed q,
Figure 2 makes clear that a necessary and sufficient condition for a solution such

thatC>Oanda<lis
c'(l;q) > e(1) >0.

(A.41)

Since limoq c'(l, q) = CS, (A.41) will be satisfied for sufficiently small q as long as
C > c2(1) or, equivalently, as stated in the proposition, if < R(-y—1)rns/(R7—
1), where ms = cs/(R — 1) is the level of real balances under the sustainable

The additional complication of this proposition is that we now have 3 nonlinear
equations in 3 unknowns, the additional unknown being 'y. Our proof is structured
as follows. First, we borrow the analysis from the proof of Proposition 4 to solve
the equation c'('y,a;q) = c2('y,a;q) for (c,a) given ('y;q). We will denote the
implied solution for c as C'('y; q). This is symmetric to the second part of our
proof which examines C3(-y; q). During these two steps we characterize C' and c3
40

using Figure 3. Our proof concludes by showing that there are pairs ('y; q) with

> 1, and 0 < q <

1,

such that C'(; q) = c3(; q).

Step 1. Taking
a; q) as a =

'y as given, we denote the value of a for which c1 (, a; q) =
a(; q). The value of c for which c'(y, a; q) = c2(, a; q) is given
byc = C1(7; q) = c'(y, a(; q); q) = c2(, a(; q); q).

It is useful to characterize a and C'. First, we examine their derivatives
with respect to q. Recall, from Proposition 4, that C < 0, for all 0 < a < 1.
Furthermore, c > 0 for a < 1, while c = 0 for a = 1. We also have c = 0 for
q = 0, c. > 0 for q > 0 and c. <0 for all q. By totally differentiating c1 = 2 with
respect to a and q, we can use these facts to show that aq = (C—C)/(c.—C) > 0.
We cannot unambiguously sign Cq' = C + Caq = (cc — c.C)/(C — c). Over
= CS for q = 0,
some range, however, C' must be decreasing in q because
C' < cs for all q> 0, and Cqqo = CqO <0.
Second, we characterize the range of q for which a and C' are defined. Recall
from the proof of Proposition 4, that (i) c2('y, 1; q) does not depend on q so we
denote it as c2(-y, 1) and (ii) a and C' are defined for any q such that c'(-y, 1; q) >
c2('y, 1). There are two possibilities implied by these facts: a and C' are defined
= 1, or (ii) for all 0 < q
either (i) for all 0 < q <
1 where (-y) is
the value of q for which c'(7, 1; q) = c2(-y, 1). In the latter case, when y) < 1,
we also have the result that the lowest value of C' for that 'y is c2(-y, 1).

<y) <

Third, we characterize the derivatives of a and C' with respect to 'y. From

(A.42),c=0forq=0andC<0forq>0. From(A.43),c<0forallq.

Hence, it is not possible to sign

to sign C4 since C = c + ca7 =

forq=0andC4 <Oforq>0.

(c — C)/(C. — c). However, it is possible
(cc — CC)/(C — c.). This implies C = 0

Finally, we characterize the range of 'y for which a and C' are defined. The
lower bound on values of 'y for which a and C' are defined is

')x/

< c2(7, 1) <CS.
because C2(, 1) = CS. Hence ) = 0. For > , 0 < (R—
This implies that there is no upper limit on 'y for which a and C' are defined,
since limoq c'(7, 1; q) CS > c2(y, 1) for all > y. So we have y) > 0 for all
41

C' is illustrated as a function of q in Figure 3 using these results. Notice
that C1(; q) is only defined at q = 0 and equals CS. For any 'y > 'y, such
as 'y, C'('y;q) = CS for q = 0, and C'(-y;q) < CS for 0 < q < (-y). The
figure is consistent with Cv4 < 0, but since we cannot signG, we illustrate C'
as a non-monotonic function of q, except in the neighborhood of q = 0 since
C('y; q)q=o = Cq=o < 0. In drawing the figure we have also used the otherwise
unimportant fact that CqqO < 0.
Step 2. Now consider C3('y; q). It is defined for all 0 < q < 1 and 'y > 1.
From (A.44), C < 0 and c > 0. Given the assumption in the statement of
the proposition that ccs/(R — 1) < + F(q) for some q > 0, it follows that
qCs/(R — 1) < + F(0). Hence, we can evaluate C3 at

We get C3(*; q) = CS[X + (q)]/[x + (0)]. This implies C3(*, 0) =

and that

c3(*, q) > CS for all q> 0. For any <*, c3(, q) > c5 for all q. For any -y > -y*
c3(,0) < c5.

results. In drawing the

figure

Furthermore, since c3 is a continuous, increasing function of q, and is defined for
all 0 < q 1, and since C' is a continuous function of q, a sufficient condition

for C' to cross c3 at least once for 0< q < 1 is c3(y,0) C'(y,(-y)).
Notice that when ('y) < 1, C'(y, y)) = C2(-y, 1) and the sufficient condition
for an intersection becomes c3('y, 0) c2(-y, 1); some algebra shows that this is
equivalent to t(0) > 0 which always holds. So for any -y > with ('y) < 1, there
is at least one 0 < q < 1 for which an equilibrium exists with c < CS and a < 1.
The only situation that remains for us to consider is the possibility that there
are no 'y > 7* for which (-y) < 1. That is ('y) = 1 for all 'y > y*• This implies
that C'(, ()) = C'(, 1) = c1(, a(7, 1); 1). Notice that
c3(, 0) = c5.

For these y, there is at least one 0 < q < 1 for which
an equilibrium exists with c < CS and a < 1.

Proposition 5. We focus, again, on the four equations (A.33)—(A.36). Without
guarantees w' = A(l — q + qa)/(R + 6), wF = A/['y(R + 6)] and F = 0. This
means (A.33) becomes
