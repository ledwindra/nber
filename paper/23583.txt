ABSTRACT
The U.S. business sector has under-invested relative to Tobin's Q since the early 2000's. We
argue that declining competition is partly responsible for this phenomenon. We use a combination
of natural experiments and instrumental variables to establish a causal relationship between
competition and investment. Within manufacturing, we show that industry leaders invest and
innovate more in response to exogenous changes in Chinese competition. Beyond manufacturing
we show that excess entry in the late 1990's, which is orthogonal to demand shocks in the 2000's,
predicts higher industry investment given Q. Finally, we provide some evidence that the increase
in concentration can be explained by increasing regulations.

Abstract
The U.S. business sector has under-invested relative to Tobin’s Q since the early 2000’s. We
argue that declining competition is partly responsible for this phenomenon. We use a combination of natural experiments and instrumental variables to establish a causal relationship between
competition and investment. Within manufacturing, we show that industry leaders invest and
innovate more in response to exogenous changes in Chinese competition. Beyond manufacturing we show that excess entry in the late 1990’s, which is orthogonal to demand shocks in the
2000’s, predicts higher industry investment given Q. Finally, we provide some evidence that the
increase in concentration can be explained by increasing regulations.

Two important stylized facts have emerged in recent years regarding the U.S. corporate sector. The
first fact is that there has been a broad decrease in turnover and a broad increase in concentration
across most U.S. industries. This fact is illustrated in Figure 1. We discuss later how this fact was
progressively uncovered by various researchers in the literature review. For now, we simply refer to
Decker et al. (2014) for a discussion of the decline in turnover, and to CEA (2016) for a discussion
of the increase in concentration. We also discuss the details of the data later in the paper and in
the Appendix. The top chart in Figure 1 shows the decline in the establishment entry and exit
rates as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS). Decker et al.
(2015) show that the decline occurs across all sectors in the 2000’s, including the traditionally highgrowth information technology sector. The bottom chart in Figure 1 shows the average Herfindahl
and Modified-Herfindahl (adjusted for common ownership, as defined in Salop and O’Brien (2000)
and implemented by Azar et al. (2016)) across all BEA industries in Compustat. Concentration
decreases in the early 1990’s as more firms go public and enter Compustat. But it increases rapidly
thereafter. The modified Herfindahl rises even faster than the traditional Herfindahl because of

the rapid increase in institutional ownership and increased concentration in the asset management
industry.
The second stylized fact is that corporate investment has been unexpectedly weak in recent
years. The top chart in Figure 2 shows the aggregate net investment rate for the non financial
business sector along with the fitted value for a regression on (lagged) Q from 1990 to 2001. The
bottom chart shows the regression residuals (by year and cumulative) from 1990 to 2015. Both
charts show that investment has been low relative to Q since sometime in the early 2000’s and by
2015, the cumulative under-investment is more than 10% of capital.1
1

There are several ways to show the same fact. Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016) shows that investment is weak
relative to profits, and also plot the yearly residual from cross-sectional investment regressions, using industry and
firm level data. These show in a non-parametric way that investment has been weak relative to Q since the early
2000’s. Jones and Philippon (2016) calibrate a standard macro-economic model assuming that the investment gap is

2

The weakness of investment does not only appear in the U.S. There is widespread agreement
that investment, and investment growth, has decreased across Advanced Economies including Europe (IMF, 2014). The decline in investment has been discussed in academic and policy papers (e.g.
Bussiere et al. 2015, Kose et al., 2017). The existing literature argues that low investment is explained by weak aggregate demand (Bussiere et al., 2015), or by financial constraints and increased
uncertainty, particularly for stressed economies (Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2015).
The goal of our paper is to propose and defend another explanation for the low investment rate
in the U.S. We argue that increasing concentration and decreasing competition in many industries
explains an important share of the decline in investment. Furman (2015) emphasizes the weakness
of corporate fixed investment and discusses some selected components, such as drilling investment.
He points out that low investment has coincided with high private returns to capital, implying an
increase in the payout rate (dividends and shares buyback). He also argues that “the distribution
of returns to capital has grown increasingly skewed and the high returns increasingly persistent.
This potentially reflects the rising influence of economic rents and barriers to competition, as some
corporations make substantial returns year after year.” Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016) show that
investment is weak relative to measures of profitability and valuation, and that this weakness starts
in the early 2000’s. Importantly, investment is not low because Tobin’s Q is low, but rather despite
high Q. This simple observation rules out a long list of potential explanations, including low
expected productivity growth or low expected demand. Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016) also find
that financial frictions, measurement errors (due to the rise of intangibles, etc.), or globalization
do not fully explain the lack of investment. Lee et al. (2016) find that industries that receive more
funds have a higher industry Q until the mid-1990’s, but not since then.
These two stylized facts – the increase in concentration and relative weakness of corporate
investment – are not controversial. But their interpretation and implications are. There is little
agreement about the causes of these evolutions, and even less about their consequences. For instance,
there is no paper showing that the rise in concentration has been detrimental to the real economy.
The increase in concentration might not be large enough to matter in the aggregate, and it might be
partly compensated by foreign competition such that domestic Herfindahl indexes might no longer
meaningfully measure competition. Moreover, it is impossible to assess the welfare consequences of
the decline in investment without understanding the cause of the decline. These issues also connect
our work to the recent controversy regarding the impact of trade with China for the U.S. economy
(Autor et al., 2013; Pierce and Schott, 2016; Feenstra et al., 2017), which we discuss in detail below.
The Competition Hypothesis In this paper, we argue that the two stylized facts are linked
and we provide evidence on the underlying economic forces. More precisely, we argue that the rise
in concentration is responsible for a significant part of the gap in corporate investment. Before
diving into the data and identification issues, however, it is important to clarify some theoretical
driven by declining competition. They find that the capital stock is 5% to 10% lower than it should be. Hall (2015)
studies deviations from prior trends following the Financial crisis. He estimates that the capital stock at the end of
2013 was 13.2% below trend (i.e., 13.2% below the expected level had the economy grown along the pre-crisis trend).

predictions. Any model of investment and competition has to struggle with (at least) two complex
issues: (i) the exact definition of investment, i.e., how to include intellectual property; and (ii) the
details of imperfect competition, monopolistic or oligopolistic, with or without free entry, foreign
versus domestic, etc. If we consider a neoclassical production function with constant returns to scale,
it is rather straightforward to argue that capital demand decreases when competition decreases, in
the same way labor demand or any other factor demand decreases. On the other hand, if we
include R&D and other intangible investment, then we need to consider the relationship between
competition and innovation. As Gilbert (2006) explains, this relationship is rather sensitive to the
details of the environment, such as the extent of property rights (exclusive or not) or the nature of
innovation (cost reduction versus new product). We argue that a fairly robust prediction in a broad
class of models is that an increase in the competitiveness of domestic entrants increases industry
investment by increasing neck-and-neck competition.
The analysis is more nuanced in an open economy, and it becomes crucial to distinguish between
leaders and laggards. Consider an industry where leaders are significantly more productive than
domestic laggards. As a result, they face weak domestic competition. Now imagine that there is
entry of foreign firms. The laggards are likely to go out of business, or at least to shrink significantly.
The leaders, on the other hand, might choose to invest and innovate more, rather than less, either
because their customers now have better alternative options (the elasticity eﬀect) or because they
want to re-establish their leadership (the escape-competition eﬀect). If we aggregate domestic firms,
we can see that the impact of foreign competition on domestic investment is ambiguous, but that
we can test the diﬀerential responses of leaders and laggards.
In Section 1, we show that the investment gap is primarily driven by industry leaders. These
firms exhibit higher profit margins but lower investment and lower capital. We then use a mixture
of firm- and industry-level data to test the implications of higher U.S. and foreign competition on
both leader and industry investment.
Identification Issue The challenge for the competition hypothesis that we put forward is to
establish a causal connection between competition and investment. The main identification issue is
that firm entry and exit are endogenous. We present later a model of entry and competition where
we derive an explicit formula for the econometric bias as a function of the shocks and the structural
parameters, but the intuition is simple enough that we can explain it here. Consider an industry
j where firms operate competitively under decreasing returns to scale. Suppose industry j receives
the news at time t that the demand for its products will increase at some time t + τ in the future.
What would we expect to see? Presumably, there would be immediate entry of new firms in the
industry. There would also be more investment for an extended period of time. As a result, we
would measure a decrease in concentration (or in Herfindahl indexes) followed and/or accompanied
by an increase in investment by all firms, both new entrants and incumbents. Anticipated demand
shocks, then, could explain the cross sectional evidence in Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016). And
similar explanations could arise from anticipated productivity shocks. The existing evidence is

5

therefore fundamentally inconclusive.
Our identification strategy is based on a combination of natural experiments (with clean identification but limited scope) and instrumental variables (with weaker identification but applicable
across all firms/industries). Our natural experiment is import competition from China, using either
the import penetration measure of Autor et al. (2016) or the transition to Permanent NormalTrade-Relations proposed by Pierce and Schott (2016). This allows us to test the eﬀect of (foreign)
competition on U.S. industry leaders. The results align well with the prediction of the models discussed above. On the one hand, Chinese competition leads to a decrease in the number of U.S. firms
as the weaker ones exit. On the other hand, industry leaders increase investment and employment,
and we observe some capital deepening. These two opposite forces produce an ambiguous eﬀect on
overall domestic investment.
The Chinese natural experiment oﬀers clean identification, but its external validity is problematic. It identifies an increase in competition for particular sector and a limited set of firms, as
opposed to a broad decline in competition for the whole economy. To identify the impact of competition more broadly, we need an instrument for industry concentration that is orthogonal to future
demand and productivity shocks, as explained earlier. We argue that excess entry in the 1990’s
– defined as entry relative to current and expected fundamentals – satisfies this requirement. We
discuss why the peculiar features of that period – especially during the second half of the 1990’s with
extreme equity valuation and abundant capital funding – are likely to have created more than the
usual amount of randomness in entry rates (Gordon, 2005; Anderson et al., 2010; Hogendorn, 2011;
Doms, 2004). We document extreme cross-sectional diﬀerences in entry rates and we show that our
measure of excess entry is indeed orthogonal to shocks that occur in the 2000’s. Using excess entry
as an instrument for diﬀerences in concentration across industries, we find that concentration lowers
investment and causes a gap between Q and investment.
Finally, we shed some light on why entry and exit have decreased and why concentration has
risen over the past 20 years. There are three broad types of explanations: (i) this could represent
a (potentially eﬃcient) response to technological changes (IT,..) that increase the optimal scope
of firms (winner-takes-all equilibrium,..) ; (ii) this could be due to demographic changes (aging,..)
in the population of potential entrepreneurs; (iii) or this could be due to lax enforcement of antitrust (merger approvals,..) or regulations that increase barriers to entry. We find support for
the regulation hypothesis: increasing regulation predicts increasing concentration across time and
industries. We find limited support for the superstar firm hypothesis and for the demographics
hypothesis: concentration is somewhat correlated with future productivity, but not after 2000; and
demographic measures do not yield robust relations.
Related Literature.

Our paper is related to several strands of literature. We highlight the key

references in this section; and discuss relevant facts throughout the paper.
Third, our paper is related to a growing literature studying recent trends on competition, concentration, and entry. There are many ways to think about competition and business dynamism,

6

and it is diﬃcult to figure out exactly who mentioned first a potential decline in these variables
for the U.S. economy. Perhaps the earliest contribution to the debate came from the study of firm
volatility, even though this research was initially not focused on competition in the goods market.
In the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, researchers noticed increased volatility at the firm level. The
trend was first discovered in stock returns, Campbell et al. (2001), and then in all kinds of real
variables. Comin and Philippon (2005), for instance, find that “firm volatility increases after deregulation [and] is linked to research and development spending.” However, just as these papers were
being published, the trends started to reverse. Davis et al. (2006) find a secular decline in job flows.
They also show that the rise in firm volatility is concentrated among publicly traded firms. Much
of the rise in publicly traded firm volatility during the 1990’s was a consequence of the boom in
IPOs, both because young firms are more volatile, and because they challenge incumbents.
Then, using the Census data, researchers started to focus on the secular decline in job flows.
Haltiwanger et al. (2011) write: “It is, however, noticeable that job creation and destruction both
exhibit a downward trend over the past few decades.” Decker et al. (2014) provide a fuller picture
and conclude that business dynamism has been declining. The trend has been particularly severe
in recent years. In fact, Decker et al. (2015) argue that, whereas in the 1980’s and 1990’s declining
dynamism was observed in selected sectors (notably retail), the decline was observed across all
sectors in the 2000’s, including the traditionally high-growth information technology sector.
Moving from flows (firm volatility, entry, exit, IPOs, job creation and destruction,..) to stocks
(concentration, Herfindahl,..) also happened in stages. The rise in concentration was first noted
in industry studies (banking, agriculture, see CEA, 2016 for references). The first broad and systematic study appears to come from the Council of Economic Advisors CEA (2016) who document
that the majority of industries have seen increases in the revenue share enjoyed by the 50 largest
firms between 1997 and 2012. Similarly, Grullon et al. (2016) study changes in industry concentration. They find that “more than three-fourths of U.S. industries have experienced an increase
in concentration levels over the last two decades;” and that firms in industries that have become
more concentrated have enjoyed higher profit margins, positive abnormal stock returns, and more
profitable M&A deals.Autor et al. (2017) link the increase in concentration with the rise of more
productive, superstar firms. Mongey (2016); Bronnenberg et al. (2012) highlight concentration patterns at the product market level. And Nekarda and Ramey (2013) (and others) study increases in
price-cost mark-ups over time. Last, Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017a) compare concentration trends
between the U.S. and Europe. They find that concentration has increased in the U.S. while it has remained stable (or decreased) in Europe. They also find that industries that have concentrated in the
U.S. decreased investment more than the corresponding industries in Europe. Faccio and Zingales
(2017) show that competition in the mobile telecommunication industry is heavily influenced by
political factors, and that, in recent years, many countries have adopted more competition-friendly
policies than the U.S.
Second, our paper contributes to the growing literature studying the recent under-investment in
the U.S. economy. We provide a brief summary of key papers, and refer the reader to Gutiérrez and Philippon

7

(2016) for a more comprehensive literature review. The decline in investment has been discussed
in policy papers (Furman, 2015; IMF, 2014), especially in the context of a perceived decrease in
competition in the goods market (CEA, 2016); as well as academic papers (see, for example, Hall
(2015); Alexander and Eberly (2016)). Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016) show that the investment
residuals – at the firm level and at the industry level – are well explained by measures of competition.
Controlling for current market conditions, industries with less competition and more concentration
(traditional or due to common ownership) invest less.2
Lee et al. (2016) find that industries that receive more funds have a higher industry Q until the
mid-1990’s, but not since then. The change in the allocation of capital is explained by a decrease
in capital expenditures and an increase in stock repurchases by firms in high Q industries since the
mid-1990’s. Relatedly, Alexander and Eberly (2016) study the implications of the rise of intangibles on investment. And Jones and Philippon (2016) explore the macro-economic consequences of
decreased competition in a DSGE model with time-varying parameters and an occasionally binding
zero lower bound. Kose et al. (2017) study weak investment growth globally, including emerging
markets. Several other papers study under-investment in Europe, including Bussiere et al. (2015);
Buca and Vermeulen (2015); Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017a).
Third, this paper is related to a large literature that aims to explain the relationship between
competition, innovation and investment. See Gilbert (2006) for a relatively recent survey. Of particular relevance to our paper, are Aghion et al. (2005, 2009); Aghion and Schankerman (2004).
Aghion et al. (2009) introduces the Schumpeterian models of competition; and Aghion et al. (2009)
study how foreign firm entry aﬀects investment and innovation incentives of incumbent firms. Relatedly, Asturias et al. (2017) studies firm entry and exit patterns in periods of slow and high productivity growth; and Varela (2017) studies the feedback eﬀects on investment from relaxing laggards’
financial constraints. She finds that improving laggards’ access to funding not only increases their
own investment, but also pushes leaders to invest more to remain competitive.
Last, our paper is related to the eﬀect of import exposure on employment and innovation –
particularly from China. The literature is large, so we highlight the key papers. See Bernard et al.
(2012) for a literature review. Bloom N and Reenen (2015) examine the impact of Chinese import
competition on patenting, IT and TFP across twelve European countries. They argue that the
absolute volume of innovation increases within the firms most aﬀected by Chinese imports; and
2
They also use industry- and firm-level data to test whether under-investment relative to Q is driven by (i) financial
frictions, (ii) measurement error (due to the rise of intangibles, globalization, etc), (iii) decreased competition (due to
technology or regulation), or (iv) tightened governance and/or increased short-termism. They find that proxies for
competition and ownership explain the bulk of the investment gap, across industries and across firms. Measurement
error due to the rise of intangibles explain some but not all patterns. Controlling for current market conditions,
industries with less entry and more concentration (traditional or due to common ownership) invest less. Within
each industry-year, the investment gap is driven by firms owned by quasi-indexers and located in industries with
more concentration/more common ownership. These firms spend a disproportionate amount of free cash flows buying
back their shares. We do not discuss governance here because the natural experiments and instruments that we
use are focused on competition. One should keep in mind, however, that there are important interactions between
governance and competition. For instance, Giroud and Mueller (2010) shows that the impact of governance is stronger
in noncompetitive industries. A companion paper studies the causality between increased quasi-indexer ownership
and investment; as well as the interaction between ownership and competition (Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2017b).

8

that Chinese import competition led to (i) increased technical change within firms and (ii) a reallocation of employment towards more technologically advanced firms. Autor et al. (2016) study
how rising import competition from China aﬀected U.S. patenting activity. They control for secular trends in patenting activities, and find the opposite: that increased import exposure led to
a reduction in patent production. Pierce and Schott (2016); Autor et al. (2016); Acemoglu et al.
(2016); Autor et al. (2016); Feenstra et al. (2017) study the eﬀects of Chinese import exposure on
U.S. manufacturing employment. They show that a large portion of the reduction of U.S. manufacturing employment can be explained by Chinese import competition. Some of these papers briefly
study capital and investment in addition to employment. Consistent with our results, they find that
increased Chinese competition led to reductions in capital for the ‘average’ firm. Frésard and Valta
(2015) study the eﬀect of tariﬀ reductions on capital expenditures, with a focus on market structure.3
Feenstra and Weinstein (2010) estimate the impact of globalization on mark-ups, and conclude that
mark-ups decreased in industries aﬀected by foreign competition.
All of the above papers on import competition analyze the unconditional eﬀect of trade shocks
on firm and industry-level outcomes. By contrast, we focus on conditional outcomes – namely how
increased Chinese competition aﬀects leaders and laggards diﬀerently. To our knowledge, only
Hombert and Matray (2015); Bernard and Schott (2006) and Amore and Zaldokas (2015) study
conditional outcomes.

Hombert and Matray (2015) show that R&D-intensive firms are better

able to cope with Chinese competition: they exhibit higher sales growth, profitability and capital
expenditures than low-R&D firms. Bernard and Schott (2006)show that capital-intensive plants
and industries are more likely to survive and grow in the wake of import competition. And
Amore and Zaldokas (2015) argue that firms with worse corporate governance are more aﬀected
by foreign competition.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 1 discusses key empirical facts
regarding competition and investment. It argues that the investment gap is largely explained by
industry leaders. Section 2 presents a model of competition and discusses its implications for
investment. Section 3 discusses our dataset. Section 4 presents the tests and results used to
establish causality between competition and investment. Section 5 discusses some (correlation)
analyses aimed at explaining the rise in Concentration. Section 6 concludes.

Three Facts about Concentration and Investment

This section presents three facts related to concentration, mark-ups and investment that help motivate our analysis.

1.1

Fact 1: Investment Gap Aﬀects Primarily Concentrating Industries

Figure 3 shows that the capital gap is primarily driven by concentrating industries. Namely, we
plot the coeﬃcients α1,t and α2,t from the following industry-level regression

log

!

Kj,t
Kj,00

"

= β1 med Qj,00,t + β2 M ean log(Agej,t−1 )

(1)

+ α1,t 1{Top 5 ∆Herfindahl} + α2,t 1{Bottom 5 ∆Herfindahl}
where Kj,t denotes total capital in industry j at time t; med Qj,00,t denotes the average value,
by year, of the median Q across all firms in industry j from 2000 to time t; and M ean log(Agej,t−1 )
denotes the average log-age across all firms in industry j at time t. Thus, α1,t measures the capital
gap (controlling for Q and average firm age) for the five industries that exhibit the largest increase
in concentration; and α2,t measures the capital gap for the five industries with the smallest increase
in Herfindahl.4 As shown, the capital gap against Q is strongly negative for industries that have
become more concentrated and positive for industries that have become less concentrated. Granted,
these results are subject to the identification issue listed above; and they may be aﬀected by foreign
competition. But they do suggest that the investment gap is driven by concentrating industries.
The remainder of the paper aims to address the identification concerns.
These results are consistent with Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017a), who compare investment
patterns between the U.S. and Europe across industries that have become concentrated in the U.S.
They find that investment in these industries decreased substantially more in the U.S. than in
Europe.

1.2

Fact 2: Profit Margins Have Increased for Industry Leaders

The second fact is that mark-ups have increased. This is true when measured using price-cost
margins (also known as the Lerner Index) as well as estimating user cost of labor and capital.
For instance, Figure 4 shows the aggregate Lerner index across all Compustat firms, along with
the weighted average Modified-Herfindahl for the U.S. economy (weighted by industry sales). Like
Grullon et al. (2016), we measure price-cost margins as the operating income before depreciation
minus depreciation divided by sales. Beyond the clear cyclical patterns, the Lerner index exhibits
a consistent upward trend that aligns with the rise in the Modified-Herfindahl.
Figure 5 shows the Lerner index of leaders and laggards separately. Leaders include those firms
with the highest market value, which combined account for 33% of the market value in each industry
and year. Laggards are those firms with the lowest market value that combined account for 33%
4

We identify concentrating / non-concentrating industries based on the absolute change in Herfindahl from 2000
to 2015, but diﬀerent definitions (e.g., based on relative changes) yield similar results. The top 5 concentrating
industries include Agriculture, Inf. publishing, Nondurable Textile, Nondurable Printing and Inf. motion. The
bottom 5 concentrating industries include Prof. services, Mining support, Nondurable Petroleum, Transportation
pipeline and Educational Services. Results are robust (albeit less significant) to excluding Nondurable Textile from
the set of concentrating industries given the influence of foreign competition.

of industry market value in each year. As shown, the Lerner index of leaders started to increase in
the mid-1990’s and reached it’s highest level in 2011-2013. The timing of rising mark-ups coincides
with the rise in the U.S. Herfindahl. As shown in Figure 1, the Compustat-based U.S. Herfindahl
reaches its lowest level in the mid-1990’s and rises rapidly thereafter. By contrast, the Lerner index
of Laggards has remained essentially stable over the past 35 years.
We must acknowledge that the Lerner index is not a perfect measure of mark-ups. In particular, it does not recognize that some of the deviation between prices and marginal costs may
be due to either eﬃcient use of scale or the need to cover fixed costs.5 But other methods also
suﬀer problems. For instance, methods following Hall (1988) (including recent methods such as
De Loecker and Warzynski (2012)) struggle to account for changing capital shares – a substantial
problem when considering long periods, including the recent shift towards intangible capital.
To address some of these weaknesses, we estimate an alternate measure of industry-level markups that roughly follows Barkai (2017) and Caballero et al. (2017). In particular, we estimate the
industry-level Equity Risk Premia using Analyst earnings projections; and use it to calculate the
capital share of output. We then combine the estimated capital share and the labor share to obtain
the profit share of output – a measure of average mark-ups. See Appendix for more details on
this calculation. We find that the profit share increased more at industries that have become more
concentrated – a finding consistent with Grullon et al. (2016), who show that the Lerner index
increased more at industries that have become less competitive.
5

See Elzinga and Mills (2011) for a discussion. Other key issues include the fact that the Lerner index ignores
firms’ exercise of monopsony power in factor markets and the eﬀect of upstream market imperfections; the departures
from cost-minimizing behavior due to, for example, governance problems; the eﬀects of dynamic competition; and
the departures from social optimum when a firm uses non-linear pricing tactics (e.g., bundling).

In the end, neither of these estimates is perfect. But they are still informative. And they both
suggest that mark-ups increased more at industries that have become more concentrated.

1.3

Fact 3: Leaders Explain the Investment Gap

The third fact is that the investment gap appears to be concentrated at Leaders. Figure 6 shows
the ratio of capital expenditures plus R&D divided by operating income before depreciation for
leaders and laggards. As shown, the investment of leaders and laggards was largely similar in the
1980’s and early 1990’s, but starts to diverge thereafter. Investment decreases even further after
2000 reaching less than half it’s 1980 level from 2004 to 2011. By contrast, laggards invested a
relatively stable share of operating income through 2001. They decreased investment after 2000,
but to a much lesser extent than leaders.
Table 1 shows a broader set of investment, capital and profitability measures separating leaders,
average firms and laggards. The first row shows the average annual share of CAPX plus R&D
contributed by leaders, as a percentage of total CAPX plus R&D across all firms in Compustat. As
shown, leaders contributed 35% of CAPX plus R&D, on average, before 1995. Yet they contributed
only 29% after 1996. The second row shows the ratio of CAPX plus R&D over operating income
before depreciation (the same as Figure 6) for each group of firms; and rows 3 and 4 show the share
of PP&E and capital held by the corresponding firms. Here, capital K is the estimated capital
stock of Peters and Taylor (2016) which accounts for the value of intangibles. As shown, the share
of PP&E and Capital held by leaders decreased by 4-6% from the pre-1995 to the post-1995 period.
Row 5 shows that the share of profits received by leaders has remained stable, which combined with
the lower share of capital implies a rise in the return on capital. This is shown in row 6. The excess

return on capital (defined as the ratio of operating income before depreciation to capital, minus the
1Y treasury rate) increased across all firms, but particularly for leaders.
To measure the capital gap due to leaders, Figure 7 shows the percentage increase in the aggregate U.S. capital stock assuming that Compustat leaders continued to invest 35% of CAPX plus
R&D from 2000 onward, while the remaining groups invested as observed. As shown, the capital
stock would be nearly 4% higher (after accounting for depreciation) today. This is a substantial
increase considering that (i) our Compustat sample accounts for 20-25% of aggregate capital and
30-40% of investment for the industries in our sample (see Section 3 for details); and (ii) the average
annual net investment rate for the U.S. Non Financial Business sector has been less than 2% since
2002. Indeed 4% accounts for a third of the ~12% gap estimated using the coarse analysis of Figure
2 and the 13.2% estimated by Hall (2015). Lower investment by private leaders, feedback eﬀects
from decreased leader investment to laggards, as well as other hypotheses such as governance and
measurement error due to the rise of intangibles likely account for the diﬀerence.

Models of Competition and Investment

The main contribution of our paper is empirical, but we need a model to understand precisely what
the endogeneity issue is, and exactly what a valid experiment or a valid instrument would be. In
particular, we need a model to clarify the issues of endogenous entry, the timing of information,
foreign demand, and the diﬀerent responses we can expect from industry leaders and laggards in
response to the same set of shocks.

Monopolistic Competition and Free Entry

Let us start with a discussion of the fundamental identification issue. We use here a simple model
of industry equilibrium under monopolistic competition. In addition to clarifying the identification
problem, the model illustrates the role of information and suggests a set of potential instruments.
The model abstracts from strategic interactions and firm heterogeneity, which we discuss later.
Description of the Model. The model is basically the industry block of a standard macroeconomic model. Firms make entry, investment, and production decisions. The timing is as follows:
• Period t − 1: pay fixed cost κet−1 to become active (or not)
• Period t: active firms are indexed by i ∈ [0, Nt−1 ]
– Invest ki,t ;
α l1−α ;
– Produce yi,t = At ki,t
i,t

All active firms have the same production function where At is productivity and li,t is the quantity
of labor hired by the firm. In terms of interpretation, it is best to think of each period as a few
years. We assume that “firms” live for one period, or, equivalently, that the fixed cost κ must be
repaid at the end of each period if the firm wants to remain active. The industry demand curve is
given by the schedule
YtD = Dt Pt−σ

(2)

where Dt is a (stochastic) demand shifter, Pt is the industry price index, and σ is the demand
elasticity across industries, which we assume is weakly above unity: σ ≥ 1. Industry output is a
CES aggregate of firms’ outputs

where ϵ is the elasticity of substitution across firms within the same industry. It is larger than the
between-industry elasticity: ϵ > σ ≥ 1.6 The standard Dixit-Stiglitz CES aggregator takes ϵ as an
exogenous parameter. It is straightforward to consider a model where ϵ is an increasing function
of Nt−1 , as in Feenstra (2003) for instance. This only reinforces the consequences of entry that
we analyze below. For ease of exposition we treat ϵ as a parameter, and we simply point out in
the discussion where endogenous firm-level markups matter. The price index is then defined in the
usual way as
Pt ≡

(4)

and we impose the market clearing condition YtD = YtS .
6

A standard calibration of the New Keynesian model is ϵ = 6, chosen to deliver a steady state markup of 20%
(Gali, 2008). The value of σ depends on the level of aggregation. In models with two sectors, home and foreign for
instance, it is typical to use σ close to 1. With finer industry definitions σ should be higher, as assumed here.

The Firm’s Problem. Let ρt be the user cost of capital at time t (i.e., the depreciation rate plus
the rate of time preference).7 The firm’s problem is

max pi,t yi,t − wt li,t − ρt ki,t ,

ki,t ,li,t ,pi,t

s.t. yi,t =

and yi,t = At ki,t

The solution to the pricing problem is to set a fixed markup over marginal cost pi,t = µχt , where the

and the marginal cost is χt ≡ A1t ραt

the same price and have the same size; which yields the industry price index (4) is Pt = µχt Nt−1

The key point is that aϵ larger number of firms implies a lower price index. The quantity index

ϵ−1
(3) becomes YtS = yt Nt−1
. It increases with average firm output yt , and with the number of

firms because of the taste for variety. The industry equilibrium condition YtD = YtS then implies
σ−ϵ

ϵ−1
yt = (µχt )−σ Dt Nt−1
. Since ϵ > σ, firm output is a decreasing function of the number of active

firms, conditional on the demand shifter Dt . Investment is proportional to output: kt =

rt +δ χt yt .

Aggregating across firms we have Kt = Nt−1 kt , so industry investment is
Kt = αµ−σ

(5)

We can summarize our results as follows:
Lemma 1. Investment per firm and total industry investment both increase with demand Dt and
decrease with the user cost rt + δ. Industry investment increases with the number of firms Nt−1 ,
while investment per firm decreases.
All firms have the same market share

so the Herfindahl is predetermined and equal to the

inverse of the number of firms:

(6)

The last step is to consider the entry decision of firms at time t − 1.
Entry Decisions. The free entry condition is Et−1 [(µ − 1) χt yt ] = (1 + rt−1 ) κet−1 where rt−1 is
the required return on entry costs, taking into account the risk of failure as well as risk premia.
7

Formally, the firm’s problem has two stages.
At the production stage, the firm solves πi,t (ki,t ) ≡
maxli,t ,pi,t pi,t yi,t − wt li,t , subject to the production function and the demand curve yi,t = (pi,t/Pt )−ϵ Yt . At the
investment stage it solves maxki,t Et [πi,t (ki,t )] − ρt ki,t . Assuming that Dt is known at the beginning of time t, when
ki,t is chosen, we can collapse the two stages into one.

17

Expected profits have to cover the entry cost. Note that the free entry condition essentially pins
down expected firm output.8 This is a typical property of expanding variety models. This free entry
condition together with the equilibrium production derived earlier, pins down the number of firms:

(7)

The number of active firms depends on expected demand, expected productivity (as long as σ > 1),
and the cost of creating a firm. We now discuss the endogeneity issue. To make the point as clearly
as possible, consider the following definition of a competitive economy.
Definition 1. The competitive limit (denoted by c) with finite entry corresponds to ϵ → ∞ and
κe → 0, holding constant the ratio ψ ≡

µ−1
κe .

In the competitive limit, the markup µ converges to 1, and the entry cost converges to zero.9
In the limit, we see from equation (5) that industry investment is independent from the number of
firms
Ktc =

αχ1−σ
t
Dt ,
ρt

(8)

and the industry price level equals the marginal cost, Ptc = χt , also independently from Nt−1 .
Identification Problem. The competitive limit allows us to illustrate the endogeneity issue. By
definition, market power is irrelevant in the competitive limit. Yet we will show that a regression
of investment on standard measures of concentration would likely produce negative coeﬃcients. To
be more precise, consider an economy with competitive industries indexed by j = 1..J subject to
industry-specific demand shocks Dj,t . The aggregate economy is non-stochastic, and factors prices
– wt , ρt , and thus χt – are also non-stochastic. Investment in industry j is determined by equation
c =
(8) as Kj,t

αχ1−σ
t
ρt Dj,t

and we specify the random demand shocks as
Dj,t = D̄edj,t−1 eνj,t

where Et−1 [eνj,t ] = 1, and dj,t−1 is known at time t − 1 and has strictly positive cross-sectional
variance: V AR(j) (dj,t−1 ) > 0. Suppose an econometrician runs cross-industry regressions (or panels
regressions with time fixed eﬀects) in order to determine the impact of concentration on investment.
The proposition below explains the source of the bias.
Proposition 1. Fundamental Endogeneity Issue. In the competitive limit with anticipated
demand shocks, the cross-industry OLS regression of log-investment on log-Herfindahl gives a slope
of minus one.
8

So long as we abstract from the covariance between χt and yt .
What happens to the number of firms depends on the limit of the ratio ψ. A realistic benchmark is to have the
ratio converge to a finite value. If the convergence of the markup to 1 is slower than that of the entry cost to 0 then
N goes to infinity. The results below do not depend on having a “finite” number of firms, but it makes the exposition
a lot simpler.

This is an extreme example of omitted variable bias. There is in fact no economic connection
between the number of firms and industry-level investment, as we can see from equation (8), but
the econometrician would recover a coeﬃcient of −1. The R2 would depend on the variance of
unexpected demand shocks νj,t. A similar issue arises if we consider industry-specific productivity
shocks Aj,t .

cross-sectional variation in industry-level marginal cost, χj,t , leads to biases as long as σ > 1, which
is the realistic case.
Instruments and Natural Experiments. There are two ways to avoid the omitted variable
bias. One solution would be to control for the demand shifter Dt . The problem is that Dt is not
observable. We can only measure nominal sales Pt Yt , which depend on both supply and demand
factors.10
The other solution is to use natural experiments and/or instruments. The model can help us
think about potential experiments and instruments. A good instrument in our model is a shock
that randomly changes the opportunity cost of entry across industries. Let us consider the general
model as a system of equations, where, as above, j = 1..J indexes the industry:

This system makes it clear that random shocks to the entry cost κej could be used as instruments.
More formally, we can state the following proposition.
Proposition 2. Variation in entry costs κej that are uncorrelated with future demand Dj,t and
productivity Aj,t would be valid instruments to assess the impact of concentration on investment.

10
The exception is when σ = 1 (i.e., log-preferences for consumers) where nominal sales are exogenous from
industry-level supply shocks, but this is not an assumption we can defend empirically.

19

We will argue that the peculiar dynamics of entry in the late 1990’s oﬀer such an instrument.
Essentially, we will document large cross-sectional variation in entry rates across industries, that do
not predict future demand or productivity, but are driven by the willingness of investors (venture
capitalists, or market participants in general) to fund risky ventures.11
A good natural experiment would be a change in the number of firms that is independent from
future demand. Following the literature, we will argue that the increase in Chinese competition;
and particularly the formal entry of China in the WTO provides such an experiment. It comes,
however, with two important caveats: first, it aﬀects only manufacturing, which raises issues of
external validity; second, it is a foreign competition shock, so it is unclear which prediction we can
test using data on domestic investment. Interpreting the China shock therefore requires a model
with firm heterogeneity, strategic competition, and foreign entry. We now discuss such a model.

2.2

Heterogeneity and Foreign Competition

The model presented above allows us to interpret industry level data under domestic competition.
Unfortunately, the cleanest large scale experiment that we have to test our hypothesis is the entry
of China in the WTO. To discuss its implications, we need to focus on firm level strategic responses.
Our goal here is to provide the simplest model that allows us to explain our empirical approach.
The most important feature of the micro data that we need to capture is the heterogeneity of firms
in terms of size and apparent productivity. We therefore consider a model of vertical diﬀerentiation
in the spirit of Shaked and Sutton (1982; 1983). Consumers can purchase one unit of an indivisible
good. A consumer of type θ purchasing one unit of quality z at price p receives utility
u = θz − p
Consumer types are distributed over [0, ∞) according to the cumulative density function F (θ). We
make a mild technical assumption about the distribution F .12 The industry is populated by a
leader (indexed by 2) and a competitive fringe (indexed by 1). The Appendix describes the case
of a duopoly instead of a competitive fringe. Firms have Cobb-Douglass production functions as
before (or any other constant return function), but the leader is more eﬃcient in terms of quality z
and marginal cost χ: z2 > z1 and χ2 ≤ χ1 . In other words, the leader has access to a technology set
{χ, z} that strictly dominates the technology set of the fringe. Firms compete à la Bertrand. Since
the fringe is competitive, it prices at marginal cost: p1 = χ1 . We now need to derive the demand
curves. There are two marginal consumer types to consider. Type θ1 is indiﬀerent between buying
11

It does not matter for us whether the exuberance of the late 1990’s was rational or not. Perhaps there were
Bayesian mistakes, perhaps there were overly-optimistic forecasts, perhaps there were bubbles driven by the option to
re-sell to future optimistic investors as in Scheinkman and Xiong (2003). At the end of the day, all that really matters
is that these factors created variation in entry rates across industries (say in 1999) that turn out to be orthogonal to
future demand (say in 2005).
(θ)
12
The distribution F is such that, for all θ, 2f (θ) + f ′ (θ) 1−F
≥ 0. This condition holds for all the distrif (θ)
butions used in the literature: exponential, normal, log-normal, Pareto, Weibull, inverse Gaussian, gamma, and
Kumaraswamy distributions.

20

from 1 and not buying at all, so θ1 z1 − p1 = 0. Type θ2 is indiﬀerent between buying from 1 and
buying from 2, so θ2 z1 − p1 = θ2 z2 − p2 , which we write as
θ2 =

p2 − p1
.
z2 − z1

(9)

Consumers in the range [0, θ1 ] are priced out, those in [θ1 , θ2 ] buy quality z1 from the competitive
fringe, and those in [θ2 , ∞) buy the high quality good from firm 2. We consider the case where the
competitive fringe is active so we assume that the parameters are such that θ1 < θ2 (see the Appendix
for primitive conditions). Notice the key property that the price elasticity of

∂θ2/∂p2

increases when

the gap in quality z2 − z1 decreases. The profits of firm 2 are π2 = (p2 − χ2 ) (1 − F (θ2 )).13 The
first order condition for the optimal pricing by the leader is
p 2 − χ2 =

1 − F (θ2 )
(z2 − z1 ) .
f (θ2 )

(10)

The leader prices with a markup over its marginal cost, and the markup reflects the quality advantage of the leader, z2 − z1 . We can consider two types of competitive pressures from the competitive
fringe: quality competition (z1 ↗), and cost competition (χ1 ↘). Competition always increases
production and investment at the industry level, but what is does to the leader depends on the
initial conditions and on the nature of competition. We summarize the key results in the following
proposition.14
Proposition 3. A more eﬃcient leader is more likely to react to competition by increasing production and investment. With respect to quality competition,
∂θ2
∂χ1

∂θ2
∂z1

< 0. With respect to cost competition

< 0 but the magnitude decreases with z2 − z1 .

Proof. All the properties can be derived from the equilibrium condition that combines the definition
of θ2 in (9) with optimal pricing condition (10):
χ1 − χ2
1 − F (θ2 )
− θ2 =
f (θ2 )
z2 − z1
Under the technical assumption A1, the left hand side is a decreasing function of θ2 . See the
Appendix for details.
To understand the results, one should remember that there are two eﬀects of an increase in
competition. The direct eﬀect, holding p2 constant, is to steal market share from the leader, i.e., to
increase θ2 . As one can see from (9), a decrease in p1 or an increase in z1 both increase θ2 if p2 does
not change. The other eﬀect of competition is to change the elasticity of θ2 to p2 , which changes the
optimal markup and therefore the price p2 . The leader responds to competition by lowering its price

It is straightforward to generalize to N firms. In that case we have πi = (pi − c) (F (θi+1 ) − F (θi )) with the
convention that θN+1 = ∞.

The Appendix presents the case where, instead of a competitive fringe, we have duopoly between the leader and
a dominated competitor.

p2 , thereby undoing some of the initial impact on its sales. Which eﬀect dominates depends on the
nature of the competition shock and on the initial conditions. With quality-based competition, the
second eﬀect dominates and a dominating incumbent (remember that χ2 ≤ χ1 ) increases its sales
in response to competition. With cost-based competition, the first eﬀect dominates and incumbent
sales decline, but the decline is weaker when the incumbent dominates more in the quality dimension
(z2 − z1 is large). Of course, the neat dichotomy between quality and cost only exists in the stylized
model. In reality, competition is always a mix of cost and quality. Overall, the key prediction is that
competition is more likely to stimulate investment by the leader when the leader is more eﬃcient.
This result echoes the ones emphasized in the Schumpeterian innovation literature discussed below.
The theoretical results above do not depend on whether competition comes from domestic or
from foreign firms. The empirical tests, however, depend on the geographic origin of competition.
We only measure domestic investment at the industry level. Therefore we cannot test the most basic
prediction that competition increases aggregate (industry) investment because we do not measure
investment by foreign firms. The predictions regarding industry investment are ambiguous, so we
focus on the firm-level predictions in our tests.
Corollary 2. Consider an industry disrupted by a foreign entrant with marginal cost χ1 and quality
z f ∈ (z1 , z2 ). Investment by the industry leader increases but the impact on domestic industry
investment is ambiguous.
The impact on domestic industry investment is ambiguous because the competitive fringe of
ineﬃcient firms might be wiped out by the foreign entrant. On the other hand, the industry
leader reacts by being more aggressive. We test this proposition using the surge in Chinese import
competition into the U.S. as a natural experiment.15

2.3

Innovation and Dynamic Competition

So far we have framed our discussion in the context of a neoclassical production function, where
capital k is simply an input in production. There is, however, a large literature that focuses on the
link between competition and innovation. At some level, this is just a relabeling of the variables.
We can define k either as capital expenditure or as R&D. But there is a quantitative diﬀerence.
The benchmark model presented earlier uses a constant return to scale production function. The
innovation literature, on the other hand, focuses on factors that increase productivity in the long
run and typically create increasing returns over some range.
A large literature has studied the link between competition, investment, and innovation (see
Gilbert (2006) for a recent survey). From a theoretical perspective, we know that the relationship is
non-monotonic because of a trade-oﬀ between average and marginal profits. Competition reduces the
level of profits, but it also makes them more elastic to innovation, i.e., it can increase the diﬀerence
15

Note that the predictions are less clear if the foreign entrant also has a lower marginal cost. In that case the
leader would still always lower its price, but it is unclear what would happen to its market share. So we are not
predicting that leaders always and everywhere react by investing more. Rather, we emphasize that the ones that
enjoy a quiet life because of their dominant position are more likely to do so.

22

between the profits a firm earns if it innovates and the profits it earns if it does not innovate. The
theoretical point is straightforward, but as Richard Gilbert states, “diﬀerences in market structure,
the characteristics of innovations, and the dynamics of discovery lead to seemingly endless variations
in the theoretical relationship between competition and [innovation]”.
The point we wish to emphasize is that, broadly speaking, the theoretical predictions and the
empirical evidence line up with our results in Proposition 3 above. For the UK, Aghion et al. (2009)
find that the threat of entry spurs innovation incentives in sectors close to the technology frontier,
but discourages innovation in laggard sectors. One interpretation is that advanced incumbents can
innovate to escape competition, while laggards simply see their rents competed away. These eﬀects
can be modeled in a simple way using a dynamic duopoly, as in Aghion et al. (2014). In this class
of models, there is an escape competition eﬀect and a Schumpeterian eﬀect. The former increases
investment when industries face more neck-and-neck competition. The latter may lower incentives
to invest in the presence of leaders and laggards. As a result, the threat of technologically advanced
foreign entry aﬀects firms diﬀerently: it spurs investment by domestic leaders, but discourages
investment among laggards. It may lead to a lower entry rate, or a higher exit rate, which ultimately
results in fewer, but larger firms.

Summary of Testable Predictions

Consider firm i in industry j and write it’s investment as
ki,j,t = F (Cj,t , Xi,j,t , Yi,j,t)
where Cj measures competition in industry j, Xi,j are observable determinants of investment and
Yi,j are unobservable ones. Aggregating across firms, industry investment is
Nj,t−1

K̄j,t =

ki,j,t .

i=1

Our tests allow us to study two hypotheses:
• H1: industry investment increases with competition,

∂ K̄j
∂Cj

> 0. This is true in standard

models including CES/monopoly, oligopoly, etc. It might not be true in some models of
“innovation” because of the business stealing/Schumpeterian eﬀect.
• H2: investment by leading firms increases with competition,
not true in symmetric CES (because there are no leaders, so

> 0. This is

decreases even though Kj

increases with competition). But it is true in many models of vertical diﬀerentiation and
innovation with “escape competition” eﬀects.
Three observations are in order: first, in all models we have studied, H1 is weaker than H2, so
testing H2 is the more demanding test. Second, an instrument for Cj is required to test either of
these hypotheses because, as discussed above, Cj is correlated with Yi,j . Third, we can test H1 or

H2 using either an increase or a decrease in Cj – both are valid tests. It is important to distinguish
this point from the fact that, overall, we have witnessed an decrease in competition in recent years.
More precisely, we perform the following tests:
1. Chinese competition allows us to test H2 in the case where dCj > 0 on average.
2. Excess entry allows us to test H1 with dCj > 0 (in the cross-section, immediately following
the 1990’s) and dCj < 0 (in the time series, as ‘excess firms’ exit)
3. Regulation allows us to test H1, with dCj < 016
The following table summarizes our tests, and the associated hypotheses and average changes in
competition dCj . As a preview of results, we also include the estimated coeﬃcients.

Data

Testing our hypothesis in detail requires the use of micro-data. We start from the same dataset as
Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016) and append data on import exposure. The final dataset includes
a wide range of aggregate-, industry- and firm-level data. The data fields and data sources are
summarized in Table 3. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 discuss the aggregate and industry datasets, respectively. Section 3.3 discusses the firm-level dataset, including key definitions. Section 3.4 discusses
the import dataset; and Section 3.5 discusses data on Regulation import dataset.
Firm- and industry-data are not readily comparable; they diﬀer in their definitions of investment
and capital, and in their coverage. As a result, we spent a fair amount of time simply reconciling
the various data sources. We refer the reader to Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016) for details on the
reconciliation and validation exercises.

3.1

Aggregate data

Aggregate data on funding costs, profitability, investment and market value for the U.S. Economy
and the non financial sector is gathered from the U.S. Flow of Funds accounts through FRED. These
data are used in the aggregate analyses discussed in the introduction; and to reconcile and ensure
the accuracy of more granular data.

Note that Regulation also is a potential explanation for why the average dCj < 0

Industry data

Industry-level investment and profitability data – including measures of private fixed assets (currentcost and chained values for the net stock of capital, depreciation and investment) and value added
(gross operating surplus, compensation and taxes) – are gathered from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA). Note that BEA I and K include intangible assets (i.e., software, R&D, and some
intellectual property), not just tangible capital.
Investment and profitability data are available at the sector (19 groups) and detailed industry
(63 groups) level, in a similar categorization as the 2007 NAICS Level 3. We start with the 63
detailed industries and group them into 47 industry groupings to ensure investment, entry and
concentration measures are stable over time. In particular, we group detailed industries to ensure
each group has at least ~10 firms, on average, from 1990 - 2015 and it contributes a material share of
investment (see Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016) for details on the investment dataset). We exclude
Financials and Real Estate; and also exclude Utilities given the influence of government actions in
their investment and their unique experience after the crisis (e.g., they exhibit decreasing operating
surplus since 2000). Last, we exclude Management because there are no companies in Compustat
that map to this category. This leaves 43 industry groupings for our analyses. All other datasets
are mapped into these 43 industry groupings using the NAICS Level 3 mapping outlined by the
BEA.
We define industry-level gross investment rates as the ratio of ‘Investment in Private Fixed Assets’ to lagged ‘Net Stock of Private Fixed Assets’; depreciation rates as the ratio of ‘Depreciation
of Private Fixed Assets’ to lagged ‘Net Stock of Private Fixed Assets’; and net investment rates
as the gross investment rate minus the depreciation rate. Both Current-Cost and Chained-Value
investment/depreciation rates are available. We use current-cost amounts to compute Net Investment Rates, and chained quantity indices for industry-level regressions of log(K).17 Investment
rates are computed across all asset types, as well as separating intellectual property from structures
and equipment.
17
Our results are generally robust to using chained quantity indices instead of current costs when computing net
investment rates

Firm-level data
Dataset

Firm-level data is primarily sourced from Compustat, which includes all public firms in the U.S.
Data is available from 1950 through 2016, but coverage is fairly thin until the 1970’s. We exclude
firm-year observations with assets under $1 million; with negative book or market value; or with
missing year, assets, Q, or book liabilities.18 In order to more closely mirror the aggregate and
industry figures, we exclude utilities (SIC codes 4900 through 4999), real estate (SIC codes 5300
through 5399) and financial firms (SIC codes 6000 through 6999); and focus on U.S. incorporated
firms.
We supplement Compustat with three sources, all available through WRDS:
1. Execucomp: We gather CEO age from Execucomp, and use it to test theories of concentration
in Section 519
2. I/B/E/S: We gather EPS analyst forecasts from I/B/E/S. Forecasts are used to (i) control
for projected growth in our excess entry estimate and (ii) estimate the cost of capital in the
mark-up estimates reported in the Appendix

20

3. Intangible Capital Estimates: Last, we gather firm-level intangible capital estimates as defined in Peters and Taylor (2016). Peters and Taylor (2016) rely on detailed investment and
depreciation assumptions by intangible asset type to estimate firm-level (on- and oﬀ-balance
sheet) intangible capital. They capitalize R&D as well as a portion of SG&A; and back-fill
investment whenever data is not available (e.g., before firms become public). We use these
figures in firm-level regressions with the China shock.
Firms are mapped to BEA industry segments using ‘Level 3’ NAICS codes, as defined by the BEA.
When NAICS codes are not available, firms are mapped to the most common NAICS category
among those firms that share the same SIC code and have NAICS codes available. Firms with an
‘other’ SIC code (SIC codes 9000 to 9999) are excluded from industry-level analyses because they
cannot be mapped to an industry.
Firm-level data is used for two purposes:
• First, we aggregate firm-level data into industry-level metrics and use the aggregated quantities
to explain industry-level investment behavior . We consider the aggregate (i.e., weighted
18

These exclusion rules are applied for all measures except firm age, which starts on the first year in which the
firm appears in Compustat irrespective of data coverage
19
Execucomp data is already mapped to Compustat in WRDS.
20
IBES provides the consensus of all available forecasts as of the middle (the Thursday following the second Friday)
of each month. IBES data is mapped to Compustat GVKEY through a two-step approach. First, we use the header
map between GVKEY and IBES Ticker provided in the Compustat Security table (IBTIC variable). Then, for
those GVKEYs that have missing IBTIC in Compustat and have a valid PERMNO, the link is supplemented with
additional historical GVKEY-IBES ticker links as follows: we first merge the rest of GVKEYS with PERMNOs on
a historical basis using CRSP-Compustat Merged Database. Then, we bring in additional IBES Tickers from the
IBES-PERMNO link (we use the WRDS ICLINK and CIBESLINK applications).

average), the mean and the median for all quantities, and use the specification that exhibits
the highest statistical significance. We require at least 5 firms in a given industry-year pair
to include a given observation in industry-level analyses (all firms are included in firm-level
analyses, irrespective of the number of firms in a given industry-year).
• Second, we use firm-level data to analyze the determinants of firm-level investment through
panel regressions. We compute a wide range of financial measures, including investment, cash
flow, operating surplus, etc. The main variables are discussed in the following section; with
additional details on the sample selection, variable definitions and data quality tests available
in Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016).
3.3.2

Firm-level Definitions

Capital. We consider three measures of capital: net Property, Plant and Equipment (item
PPENT), Intangible capital at replacement cost (item K_INT from Peters and Taylor (2016)) and
total capital (PPENT + K_INT).
Employment. We use Compustat field EMP as a measure of employment
Entry and Exit. Entry is defined as the first year in which a firm (GVKEY) appears in
Compustat and does not violate our exclusion restrictions. Enforcing exclusion restrictions has a
minimal eﬀect on our results, and ensures that our entry/exit rates map to all other analyses. Exit
is defined as the last year available for a given GVKEY. We diﬀerentiate across exit types using
field DLRSN, which is equal to 1 when a firm exits due to M&A.
Age.

Firm age is defined as the number of years over which a firm appears in Compustat,

irrespective of whether the underlying data fields satisfy our exclusion restrictions.
Q. Firm-level Q is defined as the ratio of market value to total assets (AT). We compute
market value as the market value of equity (ME) plus total liabilities (LT) and preferred stock
(PSTK), where the market value of equity (ME) is defined as the total number of common shares
outstanding (item CSHO) times the closing stock price at the end of the fiscal year (item PRCC_F).
The resulting aggregate and mean Q from Compustat closely mirror the Flow of Funds Q.
Competition. Measures of competition aim to measure business dynamism, concentration
and/or market power. We compute (i) the log-change in the number of firms in a given industry as
a measure of entry and exit; (ii) the share of sales and market value held by the top 4, 8 and 20 firms
in each industry; (iii) sales and market value Herfindahls as measures of concentration; and (iv) the
common ownership-adjusted Herfindahl defined in Salop and O’Brien (2000) and implemented by
Azar et al. (2016). The definition of items (i) to (iii) is standard. For (iv), we refer the reader to
Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016) for details on the calculation.
27

We use Compustat item SALE for measures of sales concentration and market value as defined in
the computation of Q above for measures of market value concentration. We use the sales Herfindahl
as our primary measure of competition because it exhibits a higher correlation with investment as
discussed in Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016).
In addition to the above US-focused measures, we compute an import-adjusted Herfindahl
HHI IA that aims to account for foreign competition. Due to data limitations, we only observe
the total U.S. imports – not the number of firms they originate from. We therefore use HHI U S
to estimate HHI IA as follows: consider an industry with x firms in the U.S. and N firms globally,
all with equal shares of the U.S. market. The U.S. share of output is s =
Herfindahl

Under these assumptions, the import-adjusted Herfindahl could then be

HHI IA =

which is true as long as the concentration of foreign firms is the same as the concentration in the
U.S. This is a strong assumption – but it is hard to justify a diﬀerent one. We therefore assume
this holds across all industries.
Figure 8 plots the average U.S. and import-adjusted Herfindahl across all industries in our
sample. As shown, the two are fairly close together through 2000 but start to diverge thereafter.
By 2015, the import-adjusted Herfindahl is much lower than the U.S. Herfindahl – but it still exhibits
a substantial increase from 1995 to 2010.

21

21
It is worth noting that the number of U.S. firms in industries most aﬀected by foreign competition has decreased
drastically in the last few years (e.g., for the Non-Durable Textile industry, the Herfindahl increased from 0.08 in
2000 to 0.5 in 2015). Assuming that the concentration of foreign firms is the same as U.S. concentration does not
appear appropriate for these industries. For some tests (particularly the Regulation tests), we therefore assume that
foreign firms are perfectly competitive when computing the import-adjusted Herfindahl.

The benefit from using Compustat to compute measures of Competition is that they are available
every year. But this introduces two limitations: (i) Compustat covers only a portion of each industry,
which under-states competition and (ii) a portion of sales by US-incorporated firms may be realized
abroad, such that we over-state U.S. sales. To complement these measures, we gather industry
measures of sales and market value concentration from the Economic Census – these measures
cover the entire U.S. economy, and consider only US-sales. Other benefits of census-based measures
are described in Grullon et al. (2016)Economic Census measures include the share of sales held by
the top 4, 8, 20 and 50 firms in each industry. They are available for a subset of NAICS industries
for 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012. We aggregate concentration ratios to our 43 industry groupings by
taking the average and/or weighted average across industries.
Mark-ups. Our primary measure of mark-ups is the price-cost ratio (also known as the Lerner
index). The Lerner index diﬀers from the Herfindahl and Concentration ratios because it does not
rely on precise definitions of geographic and product markets; rather it aims to measure a firm’s
ability to extract rents from the market. We followGrullon et al. (2016) and define the Lerner Index
as operating income before depreciation minus depreciation divided by sales.

China import-competition data

Data on international trade is sourced from the UN Comtrade Database22 and Peter Schott’s website.
UN Comtrade data is used by Autor et al. (2016) (among others) and includes bilateral imports
by six-digit Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) products. Data for a
consistent set of countries is available from 1991 to 2014. We map these data to six-digit NAICS
22

http://comtrade.un.org/db/default.aspx

29

codes by applying the crosswalk in Pierce and Schott (2012), which maps 10-digit HS products to
six-digit NAICS industries. We also obtain Normal-Trade-Relations tariﬀ gaps from Peter Schott’s
website. These tariﬀ gaps are used in Pierce and Schott (2016) and are defined for NAICS level 6
industries.23
We supplement the import competition data with the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry
Database, which includes output data by NAICS Level 6 manufacturing industry from 1971 to
2009. It also includes measures of the production structure in each industry (such as production
workers as a share of total employment, the log average wage, etc.), which are used as controls in
regressions and to test alternate theories of concentration. These datasets are discussed extensively
in other papers so we refer the reader to Pierce and Schott (2016); Schott (2008) and Autor et al.
(2016) for additional details.

3.5

Regulation data

As a measure of the amount and change in regulations aﬀecting a particular industry, we gather
the Regulation index published by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The index
relies on text analysis to count the number of relevant restrictions for each NAICS Level 3 industry from 1970 to 2014. Note that most, but not all industries are covered by the index. See
Al-Ubaydli and McLaughlin (2015) for additional details. When necessary, we aggregate the regulation index from NAICS level 3 industries into BEA industries by taking the median number of
restrictions across all firms in an industry.24

4

Empirical tests and results

To establish causality between competition and investment, we perform two analyses. First, we
use import exposure to China as an experiment for increased competition; and find that leaders in
manufacturing industries more exposed to Chinese competition increased investment more. This
analysis provides clean identification but applies only to manufacturing industries. To improve
external validity, we use excess entry in the 1990’s (relative to entry predicted using Q, sales,
profitability, etc.) as an instrumental variable for concentration. We find that industries with
higher excess entry, and therefore less concentration/more competition, invested more in the 2000’s.
The increase in investment is temporary and decreases over time as the number of ‘excess’ firms in
an industry decreases. This latter analysis – discussed in Section 4.2– has weaker identification, but
applies across all firms/industries.

23

NTR gaps are available in file ‘gaps_by_naics6_20150722_fam50’, which includes NTR gaps for each NAICS
Level 6 code.

We also considered the weighted mean by assets, but the median exhibits higher predictive power

China Import Competition
Empirical Strategy.

We use the growth of China and associated import exposure as a natural experiment for competition
in U.S. manufacturing industries. As shown in Figure 9, imports from China started to increase in
the early 1990’s, and experienced a very rapid rise after 2000. The ‘China shock’ has been used in a
variety of studies, including Acemoglu et al. (2016); Autor et al. (2016); Pierce and Schott (2016),
among others. As discussed in Autor et al. (2016), three features of China’s rise support its use as
a natural experiment: (i) the unexpected nature of China’s export growth, which was anticipated
by very few observers; (b) China’s substantial isolation under Mao, which created abundant opportunities for later catch up; and (c) China’s distinctive comparative advantage in Manufacturing,
which generated a material global supply shock.

Notes: Annual data for Manufacturing industries only. Mean import exposure across NAICS level 6 industries, based
on data from UN Comtrade. Import penetration is constructed by dividing U.S. manufacturing imports from China
by U.S. domestic manufacturing absorption as of 1991. Industry absorption is defined as U.S. domestic manufacturing
output plus imports less exports.

Following Autor et al. (2016), we define import penetration ratio for industry j:
∆IPjtU S =

US
∆Mjt
Yj,91 + Mj,91 − Ej,91

(11)

U S denotes the change in imports from China from 1991 to t; and Y
where ∆Mjτ
j,91 + Mj,91 − Ej,91

denotes the initial absorption (defined as output, Yj,91 , plus imports, Mj,91 , minus exports, Ej,91 ).
Yj,91 is sourced from the NBER-CES database; while Mj,91 and Ej,91 are sourced from the UN
Comtrade Database (and measure U.S. imports and exports with the rest of the world). Only

31

NAICS level 6 industries where data is available across all sources are included in the analyses.25
We use 1991 as our benchmark year because data is available across a broad sample of countries
starting that year.
As explained in Propositions 1 and 2, we need to worry about changes in competition that are
driven by future demand or productivity. We use two instrumental approaches. The first instrument,
based on Acemoglu et al. (2016) uses import from China to eight other high-income countries. In
particular, we compute
∆IP OC
jt =

OC
∆Mjτ
Yj,91 + Mj,91 − Ej,91

OC denotes the change in imports from China in industry j during year t to eight other
where ∆Mjτ

high-income countries; while the denominator is the same as above.26 This instrument is valid if
relative demand shocks between two industries are uncorrelated between the U.S. and the 8 other
countries. The second instrument uses the reduction in tariﬀ rate uncertainty from the U.S. granting
PNTR to China, as in Pierce and Schott (2016). We discuss this second instrument later.
Armed with the above measure of trade exposure, we examine the link between increased competition from China and investment using a generalized OLS diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences (DID) specification:

dependent variable is a given measure of capital (e.g., PP&E, Intangible capital, etc.) for firm

of interest. The first one measures the unconditional eﬀect of Chinese competition. The second
term adds an indicator for leader firms27 , to capture diﬀerences in investment between leaders and
′
laggards. The remaining terms are controls. They include time-varying industry (Xj,t−1
λ) and

firm characteristics (Xi,t−1 γ), as well as a constant, year and firm fixed eﬀects (α, ηt and µi ,

respectively). In particular, we include the lagged firm age as a firm-level control, and the following
25

The main concern with this is that some industry segments in the NBER-CES have no representation in Compustat and/or no import data from UN Comtrade. To mitigate this, we repeat all tests using an alternate measure
of import penetration that does

; and exclude all industry-level controls which are sourced from the

NBER-CES database. We find consistent – and in some cases more significant – results when using this broader
sample, which suggests that omitted industries due to data availability are not driving our results.
26
Following Acemoglu et al. (2016), we use Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Spain,
and Switzerland as our benchmark countries. We use 1991 as the benchmark year in the denominator instead of 1988
as used by Acemoglu et al. (2016) because import and export data for the U.S. following HS codes is available only
since 1991 in UN Comtrade. Prior to 1991, data is based on SITC codes; which would require an additional mapping
to NAICS codes. Moreover, our focus is on the post-2000 period, so 1991 already embeds a lag to reduce endogeneity
concerns.

We tested several other controls and neither aﬀected the results. The remaining time-invariant
characteristics are captured by the firm fixed eﬀects; and year fixed eﬀects account for aggregate
shocks that aﬀect all firms equally.
Our main sample for this analysis includes annual firm-level data from 1991 to 2015. We include
all manufacturing firms, irrespective of entry/exit dates in our baseline specification; but also report
results including only continuing firms

28

to capture diﬀerences in investment between firms that

eventually exit (exiters) and incumbents that survive.
Several items about this specification warrant additional discussion. First, we focus on the
level or (cumulative) changes in k as opposed to net investment to directly test model predictions.
Investment rates are interesting in their own right, but are harder to measure and often far more
volatile. They are heavily aﬀected by movements in the depreciation rate. The level of k also
incorporates alternate capital-building activities such as M&A and outright purchases/sales of fixed
assets which correspond to investment decisions as defined in the model.
Second, we use a generalized DID specification because it allows us to diﬀerentiate the behavior of incumbents that survive, from that of exiters and new entrants. By contrast, regressing
cumulative changes in K as in Autor et al. (2016) restricts the sample to continuing firms, and
therefore limits our ability to contrast investment by laggards and leaders. This is particularly
critical because, as documented in several papers, the China shock had material implications for
the number of firms and the level of employment and capital in U.S. manufacturing industries.
For instance,Pierce and Schott (2016) and Autor et al. (2016) show that employment decreased in
industries more exposed to the China shock: a lot of firms were forced to shrink/exit and local
entry likely decreased. Indeed our results are consistent with those of Pierce and Schott (2016)
and Autor et al. (2016): if we consider all firms simultaneously, we find that capital decreases with
import penetration. This is not surprising. Theoretical models do not imply that a given firm’s
or even the aggregate domestic investment / capital should increase with competition. Laggards
may reduce investment until they exit, while leaders may increase investment in order to remain
competitive/escape competition. It is therefore critical to diﬀerentiate the behavior among these
groups; and this specification allows us to do so.

PNTR Instrument. We use ∆IPj,91−11
(instrumented by ∆IP OC
jτ ) as the basis of our analyses

because it is a more direct measure of foreign competition. However, one could argue that demand
shocks across advanced economies are highly correlated. In that case, ∆IP OC
jτ is not a valid instrument and regression results may be biased. To mitigate this concern, we study an alternative
source of variation in China’s import penetration: changes in barriers to trade following the United
States granting Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) to China in 2000 and the associated
accession of China into the WTO in 2001.

In particular, we follow Pierce and Schott (2016) and exploit the reduction in tariﬀ rate uncertainty from the U.S. granting PNTR to China. Before then, China was considered a non-market
economy, which under the Smoot-Hawley Tariﬀ Act of 1930 are subject to relatively high tariﬀ rates.
Such high tariﬀ rates for non-market economies are known as “Non-Normal Trade Relations tariﬀ"
(non-NTR). From 1980 onward, U.S. Presidents began granting NTR tariﬀ rates to China, but
such waivers required annual approval by congress. This introduced substantial uncertainty around
future tariﬀ rates that limited investment by both U.S. and Chinese firms (see Pierce and Schott
(2016) for a wide range of anecdotal and news-based evidence).
In 2000, the U.S. granted PNTR to China, which became eﬀective on December 2001. The
granting of PNTR removed uncertainty around tariﬀs, which led to an increase in competition.
Pierce and Schott (2016) show that industries facing a larger NTR gap experienced a larger increase
in Chinese imports and a larger decrease in U.S. employment. Like Pierce and Schott (2016), we
quantify the impact of PNTR on industry j as the diﬀerence between the non-NTR rate to which
tariﬀs would have risen if annual renewal had failed and the NTR tariﬀ rate that was locked in by
PNTR
N T R Gapj = N on N T R Ratej − N T R Ratej
The change in U.S. policy is expected to have a larger eﬀect on industries with larger NTR gaps.
This measure is plausibly exogenous to competition after 2000: the vast majority of the variation
in NTR gaps across industries arises from variation in non-NTR rates set 70 years prior to passage
of PNTR. See Pierce and Schott (2016) for additional discussion. Using this exogenous measure
of competition, we again examine the link between increased competition and investment using a
generalized OLS diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences (DID) specification:

log(ki,j,t ) = β1 P ost − 2001 × N T R Gapj + β2 P ost − 2001 × N T R Gapj × Leader

(13)

′
+ +P ost − 2001 × Xj,91′ γ + Xi,t−1
λ + ηt + µi + α + εit

where the dependent variable is a given measure of capital (e.g., total assets, PP&E, etc.) for firm i
in industry j during year t. The first two terms on the right-hand side are the DID terms of interest.
The first one is an interaction between the NTR gap and an indicator for the post-2001 period. The
second term adds an indicator for leader firms, to capture diﬀerences in investment between leaders
and laggards. The remaining terms are controls. Xj,91 includes the initial year (1991) value of the
industry characteristics included in 12 as controls; and Xi,t−1 includes firm-age.
Note that N T R Gapj provides no time-series variation: it estimates a change in the average
level of capital following 2002. In unreported tests, we interact N T R Gapj with the mean import
U S and and use it to predict the time series of capital and K/Emp – first by interacting
exposure ∆IPj,t
U S with
it with the post-2001 dummy and using equation 13; and then by instrumenting ∆IPj,t
U S . All conclusions remain consistent, although coeﬃcients are more noisy.

Exploratory data analysis.

We begin by discussing broad trends in firm entry, firm exit, and investment for high- and lowexposure industries that lend support to our identification strategy and results. The following
sub-section includes formal regression results. Throughout this section, we separate industries with
‘high’ (above-median) and ‘low’ (below-median) changes in Chinese import penetration from 1991

Number of firms, entry and exit rates.

Figure 10 shows the change in total number of firms

in industries with high and low Chinese import penetration. We normalize the number of firms
to 1995. As shown, both sectors exhibit roughly the same patterns before the rise of China: the
number of firms was largely flat in the 1980’s, increased rapidly in the 1990’s and decreased with
the dot-com bubble. The patterns diverge, however, starting in the mid 2000’s. The number of
firms in industries with high import penetration decreased much faster than the number of firms in
industries with low import penetration. Today, there are half as many firms as there were in 1995
in high-exposure industries, against nearly 80% as many in low-exposure industries

To test the statistical significance of changes in the number of firms, we perform the following
regression
log(Nj,t ) = µj + ηt + βt ∆IPj,99−11 × 1{year} + εj,t

35

where log(Nj,t ) denotes the log-number of firms in industry i at time t; µj and ηt denote industry
and time fixed eﬀects; and ∆IPj,99−11 × 1{year} denotes the interaction between Chinese import
penetration from 1999 to 2011 and an indicator for each year. If Chinese competition leads to a
reduction in the number of firms, we should find stable coeﬃcients on the interaction term (βt )
before 2000; and decreasing coeﬃcients thereafter. Figure 11 shows the results, which support our
hypothesis. Chinese competition appears to have led to a statistically significant reduction in the
number of firms.

Notes: Figure shows the coeﬃcients βt from regressing log(Nj,t ) = µj + ηt + βt ∆IPj,99−11 × 1{year} + εj,t . As shown,
increased Chinese competition leads to a reduction in the number of firms. Annual data. Firm data from Compustat;
import data from UN Comtrade. Includes only manufacturing industries.

Is the decline in the number of firms due to lower entry or higher exit? As shown in Figures 12
and 13, primarily lower entry. In particular, Figure 12 shows the 3-year moving average aggregate
entry rate across high and low exposure industries. High exposure industries had traditionally higher
entry rates than low exposure industries. But this pattern flipped in the early 2000’s. Entry into
high-exposure industries decreased drastically and has remained well-below entry into low-exposure
industries since 2003. By contrast, entry into low-exposure industries appears to have remained
stable – aﬀected primarily by the business cycle.

Figure 13 shows the 3-year moving average aggregate exit rates, and the percent exit rate through
M&A, by level of import exposure. The total exit rates appear roughly similar across segments.
That said, exit through M&A increased drastically for high exposure firms since the mid-2000’s.
Diving into industry-level exit rates also highlights some diﬀerences. In un-reported tests, we find
that mean industry exit rate from 2000 to 2009 increases (significantly) with import exposure from
1991 to 2011. Thus, the substantially lower number of firms in high exposure industries appears to
be primarily driven by lower entry, but also aﬀected by higher exit and higher M&A activity.

Firm investment.

The number of firms in high-exposure industries decreased. Did the capital

also decreased? No: as shown in Figure 14 the mean PP&E of firms in Compustat increased
substantially faster in high exposure industries than low exposure industries. In other words, fewer
firms remained, but they were substantially bigger.

The plot includes only remaining firms for each year.

Employment. The eﬀect of Chinese competition on employment has been widely studied – most
recently in Pierce and Schott (2016); Acemoglu et al. (2016). They both show that total employment decreased in industries most aﬀected by Chinese competition. But, again, the eﬀects diﬀer
between leaders and laggards. As shown in Figure 15, the mean employment per surviving firm (at
each year) increased drastically at high exposure firms; while it remained flat at low exposure firms.
Leaders appear to have invested and grown with Chinese competition; while smaller firms exited.29
Comparing the ratio of K/Emp across high and low exposure firms, we find largely similar patterns
(see bottom chart). Note that K in this chart is defined as the sum of PP&E and balance sheet
intangibles for the corresponding firms. It is critical to include intangibles, as surviving firms in high
exposure industries appear to have over-invested in intangibles (see next sub-section for additional
discussion).

29

As noted above, a common path of exit appears to have been M&A – which supports the observed patterns.

4.1.3

Regression Results

We now discuss regression results, which confirm the qualitative observations from the prior section.
Table 4 shows our baseline results, following Equation 12. All regressions include year and firm fixed
eﬀects; as well as industry and firm age controls. We consider three diﬀerent measures of capital:
PP&E, Intangible assets and total capital (equal to the sum of PP&E and Intangibles). It is well
known that measuring intangible capital is challenging. Rather than developing a new definition, we
use the estimates of Peters and Taylor (2016). These estimates are available in WRDS and rely on
detailed investment and depreciation assumptions by intangible asset type. For robustness, we also
39

confirm that our results are stable when using balance sheet intangibles and intangibles excluding
goodwill.
As shown in columns 1 to 3, higher import penetration has a negative (unconditional) eﬀect on
capital. This is consistent with results in Pierce and Schott (2016). Separating leaders and laggards,
however, we see very diﬀerent results. Leaders increased capital with import exposure while laggards
decreased it (specifically, the coeﬃcient on the leading firm interaction is positive and larger than
the negative coeﬃcient for all firms). This aligns with model predictions in Proposition 3, where
leaders invest more to compete with entrants; while laggards reduce investment and/or exit. The
increase in investment is particularly pronounced for intangible assets. Columns 9 to 12 focus on
continuing firms; and show that leaders invested more than laggards, even when compared only to
firms that survived the China shock (i.e., firms that were in the sample before 1995 and after 2009).
Table 5 shows the results using N T R Gapj as our measure of Chinese competition, instead of
∆IPjtU S . Again, all regressions include year and firm fixed eﬀects; as well as industry and firm age
controls. Although the coeﬃcient for leaders are not always larger than the coeﬃcient for laggards,
the leading firm interaction always exhibits a positive and significant coeﬃcient. Thus, leaders
appear to have reacted to increased Chinese competition by increasing their capital stock relative
to laggards. This is particularly true for intangible capital.
The above results highlight that leaders increased investment relative to laggards when aﬀected
by Chinese Competition. Table 6 studies the eﬀects on employment and K/Emp. Columns 1-3
show that (unconditionally) employment and capital decreased with import exposure. Separating
leaders and laggards, again, shows diﬀerent dynamics. Leaders increased both employment and
capital at a similar rate. The coeﬃcient on employment is not significant in column 2, and the
leaders’ coeﬃcient on column 6 is slightly smaller than the coeﬃcient for all firms. This likely due
to a large amount of noise on the measure of employment. In fact, as shown in the appendix, both
coeﬃcients exhibit the expected signs, significance and magnitudes when using either the N T R Gap
OC .
or ∆IPjtU S as our measure of competition rather than instrumenting ∆IPjtU S with ∆IPj,91,11

To summarize, we find that leaders reacted to increased Chinese competition by increasing
investment relative to laggards. Exiters and/or new entrants exhibit a decrease in investment, in
line with predictions of competition models with asymmetric firms. Our conclusions, however, come
with two important caveats: first, they consider only manufacturing industries, which raises issues
of external validity; and, second, the implications for total domestic investment are ambiguous given
the use of foreign competition. The next section leverages excess entry in the 1990’s as an IV for
competition, in order to fill these gaps.

4.2

Instrumental Variables: Excess Entry

As noted in Section 2, a good instrument in our model is a shock that randomly changes the
opportunity cost of entry across industries. In particular, variation in entry costs κej that are
uncorrelated with future demand Dj,t and productivity Aj,t would be valid instruments to assess
the impact of concentration on investment. In this section, we argue that the peculiar dynamics of

In particular, we begin by estimating ‘excess entry’ as the level of entry above and beyond entry
predicted by observables. We then show that our measure of excess entry does not predict future
demand or productivity; but it does predict a decrease in the number of firms. It led to ‘excess firms’,
and therefore excess competition in some industries after 2000. This makes it a valid instrument
for industry-level concentration. We use it, and find that industries with more competition invest
more after controlling for fundamentals.
4.2.1

Empirical strategy

We predict ‘expected’ entry during the 1990’s based on measures of profitability, sales growth, cash
flow and Q, among others30

∆logNj,90−99 = β0 + β1 M ed Qj,90−99 + β2 M ed ∆log Salesj,90−99
+ β3 OS/Kj,90−99 + β4 CF/Assetsj,90−99 + β5 M ed EP S F cstj
+ β7 M ean f irm assets89 + β8 M ean f irm age89 + εj
where the sub-index 90-99 denotes the average value from 1990 to 1999.31 M ed EP S F cstj
denotes the median forecasted long term growth in Earnings-Per-Share by Analysts.32 Then, we
compute excess entry as the diﬀerence between actual and predicted entry
!
Excess Entryj,90−99 = ∆logNj,90−99 − ∆logN
j,90−99
The following sub-section discusses our estimates of excess entry empirically. We find large
cross-sectional variation in entry rates across industries. Industries that experienced higher excess
entry in the 1990’s had a lower concentration in 2000; which was oﬀset over the 2000’s as the ‘excess’
firms exited.
A potential concern with our identification strategy is that optimistic valuations may have led
to excess investment among existing firms. In that case, investment in the 2000’s would decrease
independently of competition. To control for this, we estimate industry-level excess investment and
excess capital in the 1990’s (by regressing net investment on industry Q, age and size) and adding
the cumulative residual as a control in our regression.
We therefore run the following industry-level panel regression over the post-2000 period:

HHIj,t−1 = θ0 + θ1 Excess Entryj,90−99 + θ2 M ean Qj,t−1 + θ3 Excess Invj,90−99 + θXjt−1 + ε1,jt
30
We also considered absolute changes in the number of firms during the 1990’s and found largely consistent
results.
31
All variables in our Excess Entry regression are based on Compustat, except for OS/K which is based on BEA
figures. This regression yields an R2 of 71% .
32
Long term growth forecasts are often interpreted as 5-year growth forecasts.

where we use Excess Entry during the 1990’s as an instrument for industry-level Herfindahl.33
In some cases, we instrument for the 2000 Herfindahl instead of the time-varying Herfindahl. Xjt−1
denotes industry-level controls for age. Namely, we include the mean age as of 1999 as an independent variable; and the lagged mean age as an instrument. Note that we instrument only for
the ‘traditional’ Herfindahl, not the modified Herfindahl, because excess entry does not aﬀect anticompetitive eﬀects due to common ownership. If higher competition indeed causes more investment,
θ1 and β1 should be negative. θ1 because more entry leads to a lower Herfindahl; and β1 because
more competition (i.e., lower Herfindahl) leads to more investment. Recalling the definition of tests
in Section 2.4, this test assesses whether

∂Kj
∂Cj

> 0 in the cross-section, where dCj > 0 for those

industries experiencing Excess Entry.
It is worth noting that, because excess entry is constant over time, we cannot add industry fixed
eﬀects in the above test. But we can use the time-series variation in exit rates and concentration
to test another implication of our results. Industries with higher excess entry in the 1990’s exhibit
higher exit rates in the 2000’s. As a result, the impact of excess entry on investment should decrease
over time – i.e., the ‘excess’ competition will decrease over time (dCj < 0). We test this by analyzing
the coeﬃcients on excess entry and Herfindahls over time; and by interacting the median Herfindahl
across all industries with industry-level excess entry. Industries that experienced more excess entry
should be more sensitive to aggregate concentration trends (i.e., the associated coeﬃcient should be
positive), which in turn leads to a larger reduction in investment over time. We include industry
and year fixed eﬀects in this second specification.
Last, note that our model predictions relate to changes in total capital, not net investment.
Obviously the former
is' the result of cumulating the latter – but for completeness we also report
&
Kj,t
results using log Kj,99 as our dependent variable. For these regressions, we include the average

value of mean industry Q from 2000 to time t (denoted as M ean Qj,00,t ) instead of just lagged mean

Q (M ean Qj,t−1 ). This is because investment from 2000 to time t depends on the path of Q, not
just its most recent level. We find that industries with higher excess entry exhibit higher levels of
capital.
4.2.2

Exploratory data analysis.

The regression results are provided in the following sub-section. This section discusses our estimates
of excess entry, and the corresponding concentration dynamics to further support our identification
strategy.
Figure 16 plots the log-change in firms from 2000 to 2009 against our estimated excess entry from
1990 to 1999. As shown, we find large diﬀerences in excess entry across industries during the 1990’s

– even after controlling for industry fundamentals. Some industries, like ‘Information - Telecom’
and ‘Accommodation’, experienced a substantial amount of excess entry, while others (e.g., Mining
- Support) exhibit too little entry. As noted previously, it does not matter for us whether the
exuberance of the late 1990’s was rational or not. Perhaps there were Bayesian mistakes, perhaps
there were overly-optimistic forecasts, perhaps there were bubbles driven by the option to re-sell to
future optimistic investors as in Scheinkman and Xiong (2003). All that matters for us is that these
factors created variation in entry rates across industries (say in 1999) that turn out to be orthogonal
to future demand (say in 2005). Nonetheless, the literature oﬀers three potential explanations for
variations in entry rates.
The first explanation is potential variations in the willingness of investors (venture capitalists,
or market participants in general) to fund risky ventures. This is particularly true given the overly
optimistic environment in the late 1990’s and the large inflows into Venture Capital (VC). According
to the National Venture Capital Association, annual VC commitments surged during the bubble
period, growing from about $10 billion in 1995 to more than $100 billion in 2000. They then
receded to about $30 billion/year for the next decade (NVCA (2010)). Per Gompers and Lerner
(2001), about 60 percent of VC funding in 1999 went to information technology industries, especially
communications and networking, software, and information services. About 10 percent went into life
sciences and medical companies, and the rest is spread over all other types of companies. Obviously,
not all entry is funded by VC firms, so this can only explain a portion of the variation in entry
rates – but the wide dispersion, and strong industry focus highlights the diﬀerential impact of the
dot-com bubble across industries.
The second is the presence of sizable stock market bubbles across most industries, as documented
by Anderson et al. (2010). In particular, Anderson et al. (2010) report that “well over half of the

S&P 500 index by market capitalization and seven of its ten sector component indices exhibited at
least some bubble-like behavior over [the late 1990’s].” Such bubbles likely translated into excess
entry – especially because firm entry increases precisely during periods of high-growth such as the
late 1990’s (Asturias et al. (2017); Hobijn and Jovanovic (2001)). The presence of excess entry is
documented for specific industries in several papers. For instance, Doms (2004) studies excess entry
and investment in the IT sector broadly – and the corresponding sub-sectors. He concludes that a
“reason for the high growth rates in IT investment was that expectations were too high, especially in
two sectors of the economy, telecommunications services and the dot-com sector.” And Hogendorn
(2011) documents excessive entry in parts of the Telecom sector.
Last, diﬀerences in excess entry are likely linked to persistent technological, competitive and/or
regulatory characteristics that make entry and exit easier in some industries than others. Such
characteristics introduce variations in the realized entry rates even for common valuation shocks.
For instance, Dunne et al. (1988) study manufacturing industries and find that “relative diﬀerences
in entry and exit patterns across industries persist over time, [which] suggests that industry-specific
factors...aﬀect both entry and exit levels.”
Interestingly, the excess entry was largely oﬀset following the 1990’s: industries that experienced
higher excess entry, also experienced larger decreases in the number of firms in the 2000’s. In fact,
as shown in Figure 16, the number of firms decreased across most industries by much more than the
excess entry.

34

Table 7 formalizes these observations. It shows the results of regressing post-2000

changes in the number of firms, as well as average entry and exit rates, on pre-2000 excess entry,
controlling for Q. Higher excess entry predicts a reduction in the number of firms; primarily due to
higher exit.

Industries that experienced higher excess entry in the 1990’s had a lower concentration in 2000;
34

This suggests the presence of an aggregate trend towards concentration (which is highlighted in CEA (2016),
among others). We discuss this further in Section 5.

which was oﬀset over the 2000’s as the ‘excess’ firms exited. Figure 17 shows this graphically.
The left (right) chart shows the Herfindahl as of 2000 (2010) against excess entry in the 1990’s.
This is essentially the first stage of our regression, excluding the additional controls. As shown,
industries with higher excess entry in the 1990’s had a lower Herfindahl in 2000; which was oﬀset
by 2010. Indeed by 2010, we see a very weak relationship between excess entry in the 1990’s and
the Herfindahl – especially once excluding Inf_motion which is a clear outlier.
Last, Table 8 shows the results of regressing post-1999 changes in industry sales and value added
on excess entry. As shown, actual entry predicts changes in value added but excess entry does not.
In fact, the coeﬃcient shows the wrong sign.
To summarize, the above results suggest the existence of substantial cross-sectional variations
in excess entry during the 1990’s, which does not predict future demand or productivity. Excess
entry does, however, predict lower concentration in 2000; which makes it a valid instrument for
industry-level investment.
4.2.3

Regression Results

Let us begin by showing that industries with more excess entry in the 1990’s exhibit more investment
and more capital after 2000. Namely, we run the following regressions for each year separately

chained-quantity indices for regressions on K and current-cost values for N I/K.
Figure 18 shows the results, along with 10% confidence intervals. As shown, the coeﬃcient on
excess entry is positive for both investment and capital. In both cases, the coeﬃcient is largest
on the years immediately following 1999, and it decreases over time as ‘excess firms’ exit and
concentration increases. The coeﬃcient is not always significant, but this is mostly driven by timeseries variation: the following section includes panel regression results. Similar, although slightly
less significant patterns are obtained when instrumenting the Herfindahl with excess entry, instead
of including excess entry directly in the regression.

Notes: Figure plots the coeﬃcient of separate, annual regressions of net investment and chained-quantity of capital
on our measure of excess entry, following equation 15. As shown, industries with higher excess entry experience a
temporary increase in investment and capital. 10% confidence intervals are shown.

Next, Table 9 contains the results of our IV panel regressions following equation 14, which
instruments the sales Herfindahl with excess entry. Columns 1 and 2 show the basic regression. As
expected, the coeﬃcient on excess entry is negative as more entry leads to a lower Herfindahl; and
the coeﬃcient on the Herfindahl is negative as lower competition (i.e., higher Herfindahl) leads to
less investment. Columns 3 and 4 interact the median Herfindahl across all industries with industrylevel excess entry. This allows us to include industry and year fixed eﬀects. As expected, industries
that experienced more excess entry appear to be more sensitive to aggregate concentration trends,
which in turn leads to a larger reduction of investment over time. Columns 5 and 6 replace the
U.S. Herfindahl with an import-adjusted Herfindahl defined as described in Section 3.3.2. It shows
results are robust to controlling for foreign competition.

Table 10 shows similar results based on log(Kj,t ) instead of net investment. Columns 1 and
2 include excess entry directly, and focus on the 2001 to 2004 period – the period over which
excess entry has the largest impact on investment. As shown, higher excess entry predicts higher
capital. Columns 3-4 and 5-6 instrument the U.S. and import-adjusted Herfindahl, respectively,

Columns 7-10 extend the period to 2010 and show results remain robust (or nearly so) over the
longer period. Ultimately, these conclusions suggest that the U.S. is still in the increasing part of
the competition-investment curve – i.e., more competition leads to more investment.

What explains the increase in concentration?

We have argued that the rise in concentration is responsible for a significant part of the gap in
corporate investment. But what has driven the increase in concentration? Several explanations
have been put forth in the literature. Grullon et al. (2016) consider five such hypotheses: (i)
antitrust enforcement; (ii) competitive barriers to entry and incumbent innovation; (iii) omission of
private firms in Compustat-based measures; (iv) the presence of foreign firms, and (v) consolidation
in unprofitable industries. They find some support for the first two hypotheses; and argue against
the latter three.
We discuss and provide some analyses for the following three hypotheses:
• Enforcement and Regulation: changes in the enforcement of antitrust laws may have
allowed firms to significantly increase their market shares over time. And rising regulation/lobbying may have allowed dominant firms to erect barriers to entry and increase market
power (see, for example, CEA (2016); Bessen (2016); Grullon et al. (2016)). Faccio and Zingales
(2017) provide a case study for the mobile telecommunication sector. They find that procompetition regulation reduces prices, but does not hurt quality of services or investments.
They conclude that competition in the U.S. is well-below levels of competition in Europe. U.S.
consumers would gain $65bn a year if U.S. mobile service prices were in line with German
ones and $44bn if they were in line with Danish ones.
• IT and the rise of superstar firms: technological change may have made markets increasingly “winner take most” such that superstar firms with higher productivity capture a larger
slice of the market (see, for example, Autor et al. (2017))35
• Demographics: the decrease in business dynamism may be driven by a decline in the growth
rate of the labor force beginning in the late 1970’s. Such a decline may reduce the start-up
rate while leaving incumbent dynamics largely unaﬀected (e.g., Pugsley et al. (2015))
To diﬀerentiate across these hypotheses, we gather/compute the following measures and explore
their relationship with concentration

35

This could be complemented by a rise in the likelihood of incumbent innovation, which could increase the
gap between leaders and laggards. This is analyzed in Grullon et al. (2016), who show that post-2000, firms in
concentrated markets possess not only a larger number of patents, but also the most valuable ones.

• Enforcement and Regulation: we rely on the Regulation index published by the Mercatus
Center at George Mason University as a measure of industry-level regulation.36
• Superstar firms: For superstar firms, we follow Autor et al. (2017) and explore the relationship between changes in concentration and changes in industry productivity. We use
census-based measures of concentration at the NAICS Level 6; along with manufacturing industry characteristics from the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database. In particular,
we compute the change in industry 4- and 5-factor TFP, as well as the ratio of output and
value-added to capital and labor.
• Demographics: we compute the median age of CEOs in each industry based on data from
ExecuComp. Industries with older CEOs are likely to be more aﬀected by demographics,
hence should exhibit rising concentration.
We find strong support for the regulation and enforcement hypothesis; some support for the superstar hypothesis; and limited support for the demographics hypothesis.

5.1

Regulation and enforcement

There is some evidence that enforcement of antitrust laws by the Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission declined during the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack
Obama, as argued in Grullon et al. (2016). They show that the number of investigations by the
Department of Justice filed under Section 2 of the Sherman Act – which allows antitrust agencies
to prevent an increase in market power of existing firms – has declined from an average of 12
cases per year during 1980–1999 to fewer than 3 during 2000–2015. This is true despite the rise in
concentration shown in Figure 1. Grullon et al. (2016) also show that completion rates for M&A
transactions have been increasing over time; and the number of merger enforcement actions filed
by the Federal Trade Commission have remained roughly stable since 1996 despite a rise in M&A
activity. Combined, these facts support the idea that anti-trust regulators are now less likely to
block proposed mergers.
These observations support the argument that declines in enforcement contribute to rising concentration. However, we must be careful not to draw causal inferences from this analysis – and
realize that these are only a limited set of data points. In fact, other measures of anti-trust enforcement exhibit opposite trends. For instance, CEA (2016) provides evidence of increased enforcement
in the form of fines/penalties and prison sentences.
To make progress on this issue, we need a measure of regulation that varies across industries.
Figure 19 shows the average number of applicable regulatory restrictions by industry, from 1970 to
2015. As shown, the number of restrictions was relatively stable in the 1970’s and early 1980’s but
36

We also compute the share of workers requiring Occupational Licensing in each NAICS Level 3 industry
from the 2008 PDII as a proxy for barriers to entry. The 2008 PDII was conducted by Westat, and analyzed in
Kleiner and Krueger (2013). It is based on a survey of individual workers from across the nation. However, we find
no no statistically significant eﬀect.

increased rapidly thereafter. This is critical, as regulation can lead to increased concentration in
three ways: (i) regulations often require a large fixed cost component which benefits larger firms;
(ii) regulation may introduce barriers to entry; and (iii) increased rent seeking may allow larger
firms to aﬀect regulation through lobbying, thereby strengthening their position as leaders.37

We therefore study the relationship between increased industry-level regulation and concentration. To begin with, Figure 20 shows a scatter plot of changes in Census-based concentration ratios
(% of sales by Top 4 firms in each industry) from 2002 to 2012, by NAICS level 3 code. As shown,
industries with increases in regulation experienced substantial increases in concentration – especially
after removing outliers. We find similar patterns using Compustat-based measures of concentration.

37

Bessen (2016) provides evidence that political factors are the primary drivers of increased profitability since
2000.

Notes: Concentration based on the Economic Census at NAICS level 3; changes in regulation based on Mercatus
index, also at NAICS Level 3.

Using Census-based measures of concentration captures all firms in the economy; but also introduces two limitations to our analysis. First, Census-based concentration measures are available
only every 5-years, which limits our ability to exploit cross-sectional diﬀerences in regulation and
concentration over time. Second, focusing on the post-crisis period omits the 1990-2000 period over
which regulation increased drastically (see Figure 19).
We use Compustat-based concentration measures to address these limitations. In particular,
Table 11 shows the results of regressing measures of competition and investment, using the regulation
index. Column 1 regresses the top 4-firm concentration ratio on the regulation index, to show that
industry concentration increased with regulation.38 Columns 2 and 3 focus on the post 1995 period
and regress net investment on the import-adjusted Herfindahl, instrumented by regulation. As
shown, industries with rising regulation became more concentrated and invested less.39 Columns
4 and 5 regress the log-chained quantity of capital, log(Kj,t ), on the U.S. Herfindahl instrumented
by the industry-level log-regulation index. It yields similar conclusions. Note that columns 4 and
5 include the 5-year lagged Herfindahl as an instrument for the Herfindahl and the 5-year lagged
level of capital as a predictor. These variables are included to focus on the eﬀect of regulation in
relatively short-term industry dynamics.

Superstar firms. Let us move on to superstar firms, as discussed in Autor et al. (2017) to explain the fall in the labor share. The hypothesis is that the eﬃcient scale of operation has increased,
38
These results are consistent with Bailey and Thomas (2015) who show that increases in Regulation are correlated
with decreases in Firm entry.
39
We use the post-1995 period because import data is available only from 1989; and the 1989-1995 period exhibits
substantial entry into Compustat due to the IPO boom (in fact, the Herfindahl reaches it’s lowest level on 1995).
The post 1995 provides more stable cross-sectional patterns of regulation and concentration.

so that better firms account for a larger share of industry output. According to this hypothesis,
concentration is driven by ‘superstar’ firms and industries that become more concentrated should
also become more productive. To test this hypothesis, we estimate the relation between changes in
concentration and productivity across NAICS Level 6 industries.40 Changes in concentration are
based on the five year periods when Census data is available (1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012) as well as
cumulatively from 1997 and 2002 to 2012. Changes in productivity are based on the same periods,
except that the last observation ends on 2009 (the last year available in the NBER CES database).
We find positive correlations between concentration and value-added per worker, which would
be true under essentially any model of increasing market power. The relation between concentration
and TFP, however, is inconsistent. We find a positive and significant correlation before 2002, but
an insignificant and sometimes negative correlation after 2002. These results roughly match the
qualitative discussion in Autor et al. (2017). They report that “industries that became more concentrated ... were also the industries in which productivity—measured by either output per worker,
value-added per worker, TFP, or patents per worker—increased the most.” The main diﬀerences –
the time-sensitive correlation between concentration and TFP – are likely driven by diﬀerent time
periods, levels of granularity and approaches. In particular, Autor et al. (2017) consider NAICS
Level 4 industries, over what appears to be a longer period of analysis (1982 to 2012).
Relatedly, Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017a) compare concentration trends between the U.S. and
Europe. They find that concentration has increased in the U.S. yet decreased in Europe in industries
that are very similar in terms of technology. Over the same period, anti-trust enforcement has arguably weakened in the U.S. and mergers approvals have increased; while the opposite has happened
in Europe. This suggests that technological factors are not the main driver of concentration.
Demographics. We estimate the correlation between the level and changes in concentration
and median age of CEOs in a given industry. Industries where the median age of CEOs was higher
as of 2002 exhibit statistically higher concentration as of 2012; and industries where the median age
of CEOs decreased from 2002 to 2012 exhibit decreasing levels of concentration. Together, these
results suggest that industries able to attract young talent remain competitive; while industries
with aging executives have decreasing competition. We note, however, that these results are fairly
sensitive to time periods and choice of measure of concentration (e.g., Compustat vs. Census);
hence are not conclusive. And the median age of CEOs is likely not the best proxy for changing
demographics. Still, these results and associated literature suggest the demographics may be one of
many drivers of increasing concentration.

Conclusion

We argue that declining competition is (partly) responsible for the low rate of investment in the U.S.
Our argument relies on the idea that firms that do not face the threat of entry do not have a strong
urge to invest and innovate. We use Chinese import exposure as a natural experiment to test this

We measure productivity by industry-level TFP; output and value-added per worker; and output and value-added
per unit of capital

idea. We find that industries most aﬀected by Chinese competition saw a decline in the number of
domestic firms, but at the same time, leaders in these industries increased investment the most. We
also show that firms in industries with higher excess entry in the 1990’s invested more in the 2000’s,
after controlling for firm fundamentals. Combined, these results suggest that the U.S. remains
in the increasing part of the competition-investment curve – i.e., more competition leads to more
investment. Last, we provide evidence suggesting that regulation is partly responsible for rising
concentration. If we are correct, the welfare consequences are significant. The welfare losses from
an investment gap driven by decreasing competition are large. For instance, Jones and Philippon
(2016) calibrate a standard macro-economic model assuming that the investment gap is driven by
declining competition. They find that the capital stock is 5% to 10% lower than it should be, and
that the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB) on short term rates would have been lifted by early 2012 if
competition had remained at its level of 2000.

Appendix I: Estimating Mark-ups
We were able to identify four broad approaches for estimating Mark-ups in the literature that
can be implemented with the available data. We implement the first and third approach, which
yield consistent, and fairly conclusive results. Results under the first approach are discussed in the
main body of the paper. This appendix contains a brief description and summary results for the
third approach. We refer the reader to Gutiérrez (2017) for additional details. We refrain from
implementing the second and fourth approach given the additional complexity.
1. Lerner Index: A purely empirical measure of mark-ups can be computed through the Lerner
Index. This measure is entirely data-driven – it is simple and easy to implement. However,
as discussed in the text, the Lerner Index fails to account for a variety of issues, such as
deviations between prices and marginal costs due to eﬃcient use of scale or the need to cover
fixed costs. It may also be aﬀected by changes in the capital shares and the cost of capital,
which are critical issues over the period of interest (see Caballero et al. (2017) for a discussion
of recent trends and interactions between Mark-ups and Technical Change). Nonetheless, the
Lerner index provides a simple empirical measure of Mark-ups. See Grullon et al. (2016) for
a detailed analysis of the correlation between concentration and mark-ups in the U.S.
2. Elasticity of outputs to inputs: The second approach was introduced by Robert Hall, and
is described in Hall (1988). It suggests a simple way to estimate (industry) average markups
based on firm or industry level usage of inputs and total value of shipments. In its simplest
form, mark-ups are estimated by regressing industry-level changes in outputs on changes in
inputs.41 However, this approach poses several short-comings. Identification of the markup parameter typically relies on time series regressions. Aggregate instrumental variables
are often used to deal with the potential correlation between input growth and productivity
growth. As a result, this method can only recover (average) mark-ups over relatively long
time-periods. Mark-ups over shorter periods could be estimated from the cross-section of
firms, but the identification issues become more problematic.
3. User Cost-implied mark-ups: Third, mark-ups can be estimated by calculating user costs
of capital from required returns. Barkai (2017) implements such an approach for the U.S.
Non Financial Corporate Sector. In particular, he estimates the user cost of capital from
expected returns on either bond or equity capital, which combined with labor costs yield an
implied mark-up. We implement a similar approach at the industry-level. In particular, we
estimate industry-level equity risk premia based on firm-level analyst forecasts as described
in Claus and Thomas (2001). We then combine these forecasts with output, taxes and labor
costs from the BEA to estimate industry-level mark-ups over three periods: 1990-1999, 20002007 and 2007-2014. Figure 21 plots the estimated change in industry-level average mark-ups

Notes: Figure plots the estimated change in industry-level average mark-ups from 1990-1999 to 2007-2015, against
the change in Top 4 firm concentration ratio. As shown, Mark-ups increased the most at industries that became more
concentrated. Estimates based on a broader industry segmentation than used throughout the paper to support more
robust ERP estimates.

from 1990-1999 to 2007-2015, against the change in Top 4 firm concentration ratio. As shown,
Mark-ups increased the most at industries that became more concentrated.
4. Firm-level estimates from production data: De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) propose
an approach for estimating firm-level mark-ups based on production data. This approach
relies on cost minimization and there being (at least) one variable input of production free
from adjustment cost for which the wedge between that input’s revenue share and its output
elasticity is a direct measure of the firm’s markup. So far, all implementations assume constant
coeﬃcients in the production function, which would fail to account for capital-biased technical
change. In principle, the model can be estimated with time-varying coeﬃcients – but this may
be computationally challenging. Moreover, the approach relies on a broad set of data and is
therefore more challenging to implement.

Appendix II: Proofs
It is convenient to define the function
ν (θ) ≡

1 − F (θ)
f (θ)

In the case of an exponential distribution, for instance, we have F = 1 − e−θ/ν and ν (θ) is constant.
To say something about the response of the leader when the follower’s quality improves, we need to
make the following assumption.
Assumption 1. The distribution F is such that, for all θ
ν ′ (θ) < 1
or equivalently
2f (θ) + f ′ (θ)

1 − F (θ)
>0
f (θ)

We need Assumption 1 is needed to prove that vertical diﬀerentiation decreases price competition.
Assumption 1 is not restrictive, however. It holds for all the distributions that we would consider
using.42

Competitive Fringe
The profits of the leader are π2 = (p2 − χ2 ) (1 − F (θ2 )) and p2 = p1 + θ2 ∆, where we define for
convenience ∆ ≡ z2 − z1 as the quality advantage of the leader. Since p1 = χ1 we can write profits
are
π2 (θ2 ) = (a + θ2 ∆) (1 − F (θ2 ))
where we define a ≡ χ1 − χ2 . Under Assumption 1, the first order conditions are suﬃcient because
the profit function is concave (π” < 0) at all points where π ′ = 0. The first order condition is
θ2 = ν (θ2 ) −

a
∆

We can see that Assumption 1 to rules out multiple equilibria, and that θ2 increases with ∆ as long
as a is positive. This proves the main proposition.
Finally, note that the condition θ1 < θ2 requires
ν (θ2 ) >

χ1 χ1 − χ2
χ1 χ1 − χ2
+
=
+
z1
z2 − z1
z1
z2 − z1

It simply says that the competitive fringe cannot be too ineﬃcient relative to the leader, otherwise
it would be priced out.
42
For example, it holds for exponential, normal, log-normal, Pareto, Weibull, inverse Gaussian, gamma, and
Kumaraswamy distributions.

67

Duopoly
We sketch the case of a diﬀerentiated duopoly. There are two firms, with quality z1 and z2 > z1 ,
competing à la Bertrand without price discrimination (for instance because θ is not observable).
Both firms have the same marginal cost χ (we can assume that they have the same Cobb-Douglass
production function described above) and the same fixed cost κ. It is straightforward to show that,
in equilibrium, the high quality firm charges a higher price, so we have p2 > p1 . Assume for now
that both firms are active, i.e., that π1 > κ, where π1 are the profits of firm 1 under duopoly.
There are two marginal types to consider. Type θ1 is indiﬀerent between buying from 1 and not
buying at all, so θ1 z1 − p1 = 0. Type θ2 is indiﬀerent between buying from 1 and buying from 2:
θ2 z1 − p1 = θ2 z2 − p2 . Therefore
p1
,
z1
p2 − p1
,
θ2 =
z2 − z1
θ1 =

Consumers in the range [0, θ1 ] are priced out, [θ1 , θ2 ] buy from firm 1, and [θ2 , ∞) buy from firm
2. Notice the key property that the price elasticity of θ2 increases when the gap in quality decreases. The profits of firm 1 are π1 = (p1 − χ) (F (θ2 ) − F (θ1 )) and the profits of firm 2 are
π2 = (p2 − χ) (1 − F (θ2 )).43 The Nash equilibrium is characterized by p1 = arg maxp π1 (p; p2 ) and
p2 = arg maxp π2 (p1 ; p). The first order conditions are
p2 − χ =
for the high quality firm, and p1 − χ =

1 − F (θ2 )
(z2 − z1 )
f (θ2 )

F (θ2 )−F (θ1 )

for the low quality firm. We can then solve for

the equilibrium prices and quantities. If π1 > κ, we have found an equilibrium. If, on the other
hand, π1 < κ, then firm 1 cannot profitably enter, and we need to consider the monopoly outcome,
denoted by m. We have pm = θm z2 and the first order condition is
pm − χ =

1 − F (θm )
z2 .
f (θm )

It is clear that θ2 < θm : production (and investment) by the high quality under duopoly firm alone
is higher than total production under monopoly. This holds a fortiori if we add production by the
low quality firm. Under Assumption 1, Pagnotta and Philippon (2011) prove (in the case where
the marginal costs are both zero), that θ1 and θ2 decrease (so production increases) when z2 − z1
decreases.

43
It is straightforward to generalize to N firms. In that case we have πi = (pi − c) (F (θi+1 ) − F (θi )) with the
convention that θN+1 = ∞.
