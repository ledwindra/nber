Education and the Prevalence of Pain
Steven J. Atlas and Jonathan S. Skinner
NBER Working Paper No. 14964
May 2009
JEL No. I1
ABSTRACT
Many Americans report chronic and disabling pain, even in the absence of identifiable clinical disorders.
We first examine the prevalence of pain in the older U.S. population using the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS). Among 50-59 year females, for example, pain rates ranged from 26 percent for college
graduates to 55 percent for those without a high school degree. Occupation, industry, and marital
status attenuated but did not erase these educational gradients. Second, we used a study of patients
with lower back pain and sciatica arising from intervertebral disk herniation (IDH). Initially, nearly
all patients reported considerable pain and discomfort, with a sizeable fraction undergoing surgery
for their IDH. However, baseline severity measures and surgical or medical treatment explained little
of the variation in 10-year outcomes. By contrast, education exerted a strong impact on changes over
time in pain: just 9 percent of college graduates report leg or back pain "always" or "almost always"
after 10 years, compared to 34 percent for people without a high school degree. This close association
of education with pain is consistent with recent research emphasizing the importance of neurological
– and perhaps economic -- factors in the perception of pain.

I. Introduction
There is considerable evidence that low educational attainment is associated with poor
health. Life cycle models of human capital model (e.g., Case and Deaton, 2005) imply that
lower education workers will depreciate their physical health more rapidly, leading to strong
education-based differentials in health and disability for older ages. As well, there are
educational differences in nutritional habits, access to health care, and differences in cognition
and the understanding of health risks (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2006). In this paper, we
consider pain, which is both associated with poor health but which also reflects an important
dimension of well-being (Krueger and Stone, 2008; Kahneman and Krueger, 2006). Many
clinical health conditions can cause pain, but in practice the link between pain and organic
bodily disorders, such as disc herniation of the spinal column, are tenuous at best. For
example, one-half of asymptomatic people – people who are not in pain and function
normally -- exhibit objective signs of spinal abnormalities on their MRIs (Jensen, et. al.,
1994). The reverse is also true; people without any discernable clinical evidence of back
disorder may be immobilized by excruciating pain (Chou et al., 2007).
One of the few studies in economics to consider the role of pain is Kapteyn, Smith,
and van Soest (2006), who find that people “troubled with pain” are far more likely to report a
disability that prevents them from working, which in turn substantially raises the likelihood of
leaving the labor force.1 Another study by Krueger and Stone (2008) used a 24-hour diary
survey to find one-third of respondents between ages 50-59 reporting some pain, with higher
rates among people with lower income. In this paper, we first use the 2004 Health and
1

Blanchflower (2008) has also considered pain as a dependent variable; his results are
discussed in more detail below.
1

Retirement Study (HRS) to document the dramatic differences across educational groups in
the prevalence of pain. We find differences across educational groups, with rates of people
aged 50-59 troubled by pain ranging from 26 percent for women with a college education to
55 percent for those without a high school diploma.
An obvious explanation for these differences is that people with lower education are
more likely to have worked in manual jobs, or to experience other types of poor health. We
can partially control for such differences using controls in the HRS for occupation and
industry, factors which appear to matter but which do not dislodge the fundamental result that
education matters a great deal for the realization of pain. But we are still concerned with the
possibility of long-term unobserved health factors that may be associated with education. As
well, we would like to test the hypothesis that education affects changes over time in pain.
For this reason, we also consider the importance of pain using data from the Maine
Lumbar Spine Study, which followed patients with intervertebral disk herniation (IDH) over a
10-year follow-up period. This unique study provided detailed clinical baseline information
for a sample of people with a common clinical complaint of lower back pain associated with
sciatica (referred pain down the leg) arising from IDH.2 We consider education-based
differences in the long-term prevalence of pain with treatment, and whether these differences
can be explained by underlying clinical health at baseline, or by access to surgical or other
medical treatments.
The initial severity of the IDH, as measured by imaging or clinical diagnosis, explains
just a small degree of variation in outcomes. Surgery has limited explanatory power in long2

We therefore exclude all patients who do not have clear objective evidence of a specific
cause for their lower back pain. All patients were required to have symptoms of sciatica that
were thought due to a herniated disc. Eligibility criteria did not require imaging data for
enrollment, however.

term pain, although surgery has been associated with modest outcome benefits (Atlas, et. al.,
2005; Weinstein et. al., 2006a,b). The most important predictive factor of long-term pain
outcomes is education. Even after 10 years, the percentage of people who experience leg or
back pain “almost always” or “always” is 34 percent for high school dropouts but just 9
percent for college graduates.
Why then is pain so much greater among lower educational (or income) groups? One
explanation is that people report pain to justify non-employment and disability. However,
there is modest evidence for this explanation from the economics literature (e.g., BenitezSilva, et. al., 2004), as well as a growing clinical and neurological literature rejecting the idea
of people falsely reporting pain. Instead, this new view recognizes the importance of the
brain in generating real pain in specific areas of the brain, even in the absence of a specific
physical injury (Melzack, 1993; Apkarian, Baliki, and Geha, 2009).
As well, there is evidence that this complex process of pain may respond to
psychosocial factors or even economic factors that are likely to be associated with education,
for example in the repetition strain injury (RSI) epidemic in Australia, which swept across
some (but not all) regions before disappearing in the late 1980s (Gawande, 2002). The strong
association between education and the prevalence of pain in both the HRS and the Maine IDH
data are supportive of the view that educational attainment is associated with social or even
economic factors that affect the neurobiological processing and perception of pain.

II. The Prevalence of Pain in the Health and Retirement Study
The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a nationally based longitudinal study of
people age 50+. The simplest comparisons focus on the question: “Are you often troubled by

3

pain?” The initial sample size for people aged 50+ was N = 10,561 (women) and N = 7,841
(men) providing valid answers to the pain question. The unadjusted comparisons are shown in
Table 1 by three educational groups: 11 or fewer years of education, high school graduates
and some college (12-15 years), and college graduates (16+ years).
Overall, the prevalence of pain among women 50-59 years old is substantially higher
among those who did not finish school (55 percent), more than double the rate for women of
the same age with a college degree (25 percent, p < .01), and still substantially higher than for
women with high school degrees (36 percent). In general, the prevalence of pain is lower
among men, which may be the consequence of differences in disease prevalence. But a
similar educational gradient is observed for them as well, with a rate of 42 percent among
those who did not graduate from high school, compared to 19 percent for college graduates.
Individuals reporting pain were also asked in more detail about the severity of the
pain. These tabulations are shown in Figures 1a (for women) and 1b (for men) for ages 5059. The percentage of “no pain” respondents is simply 100 minus the percentage of people
reporting pain in Table 1, but with more detailed gradation of whether the pain is mild,
moderate, or severe. The educational gradient carries over with regard to severity of pain. For
women in this age group, mild pain is similar across education groups (10.8 percent for those
without a high school diploma, compared to 10.1 percent for college graduates), moderate
pain is substantially greater (28.2 percent for the lowest education group, compared with 21
percent for high school graduates and 12 percent for college graduates), and there is a five-toone difference for severe pain (15.9 percent for those not finishing high school compared to
2.9 percent for college graduates). A similar pattern is shown for men; for the lowest

4

education group, 10.5 percent report severe pain, compared to 1.6 percent for college
graduates.
One might expect rates of reported pain to rise with age, but the opposite pattern is
observed, at least among those with lower educational attainment. (Rates rise somewhat for
college graduates.) As well, the education gradient largely disappears among older ages. For
example, among women age 80-89, 33 percent of those not finishing high school report pain,
compared to 30 percent for college graduates.3 Somewhat more report severe pain, 8.6 for the
lowest education group compared to 5.4 for college graduates. For men age 80-89, the rates
are nearly identical; 29 percent in the lowest and 28 percent in the highest education groups
report pain, with 6.9 versus 6.6 percent reporting severe pain.
One could explain these differences as a cohort effect, that these younger people were
more likely to experience pain because of differential labor market experiences, although this
hypothesis does not receive support from additional waves of the HRS.4 Another possibility
is differential mortality rates, so that there are simply fewer (and healthier) people who didn’t
finish high school in the sample by age 80-89, but selection bias would have to be extreme to
cause the large gradient observed at age 50-59 (and age 60-69) to disappear so quickly.
One explanation for these educational gradients is past work experience. In Case and
Deaton (2005), individuals with lower educational attainment may depreciate human capital
more rapidly. For example, working in physically demanding occupations earns a wage
3

See also Krueger and Stone (2008) who consider a broader sample of age groups; they find
pain rising again among people 90 and older.
4

One might also speculate about an experiential difference between younger and older cohorts
if the cultural acceptance of pain (pain as the “5th vital sign”) may be more ingrained in
younger cohorts. It is less likely that younger patients have received less care for their pain
than older individuals.

5

premium, but the longer-term impact will adversely affect general health, for example through
injuries, arthritis, or chronic back pain by the time they reach age 50, implying that low
educational attainment workers would experience much higher rates of pain. Thus we attempt
to control for occupation and industry, as well as other factors, in explaining the educationbased gradients in pain.
Table 2 presents a regression analysis, stratified by age group (50-59, 60-69, and 7079) but including men and women in the same analysis. For ease of interpretation, we use a
simple OLS regression analysis, with robust standard errors. Column 1 shows the simplest
regression analysis by education for age 50-59. Black respondents were less likely to report
pain (-4.7 percent, p < .05), while female gender, as noted earlier, was positively associated
with reported pain (9.3 percent, p < .01). Marital status also matters; relative to married
couples, widowhood is positively associated with pain (4.2 percent, p < .05), but only for ages
50-59; at older ages either the effects are small or not significant. However, being divorced is
strongly associated with reported pain (15.8 percent, p < .01), with gradually declining effects
for older age groups. Neither being separated, or never married, is associated with differential
levels of pain.
We also included the log of weight (in pounds), along with a squared term. The
impact of weight on pain is minimized at 117 pounds (the minimum of the quadratic), with
large associations between low-weight, and high-weight status on pain. The low-weight
status may reflect a wasting disease (there are relatively few in this category) while obesity is
likely associated with arthritis and other ailments.
The association between education and reported pain is strong. Relative to those who
did not finish high school, high school graduates are 13 percent less likely to report pain (p <

6

.01), and college graduates are 25 percent less likely (p < .01). The disparities decline at older
ages; Column (3) shows 4.2 lower reported pain for high school graduates (8.5 percent lower
for college graduates) among those aged 70-79.
Columns (4) and (5) in Table 2 report coefficients from regressions which include
individual occupational and industry variables in the HRS. Occupation matters a great deal;
Figure 2 shows the marginal impact of occupation on the prevalence of pain for the age 50-59
group, evaluated at the sample means for education, race, marital status, and weight. (Industry
effects were more modest and are not reported here.) These predicted pain measures ranged
from 25 percent (managerial) and 29 percent (professional and sales) to 43 percent (services:
private households, cleaning and building support) and 58 percent (armed forces). While the
educational gradient is attenuated, there still remains a substantial difference of 10 percent in
pain between the lowest educational group and high school graduates, and a 17 percent gap
for college graduates aged 50-59. Including occupation and industry dummy variables had
almost no impact on the educational gradients for age 60-69.
Table 3 presents additional ordered probit regressions with the ordering equivalent to
no pain (0) through severe pain (3), controlling for occupation and industry. The coefficients
on education remain significant, although the magnitude of the coefficients is (again) smaller
for ages 70-79. While the interpretation of marginal effects are complicated in ordered
probits, note that the coefficient on college education, roughly one-half for ages 50-59 and
ages 60-69, is more than double the difference in the index between mild and moderate pain
(cut point 2 minus cut point 1) and half the difference between moderate and severe pain (cut
point 3 minus cut point 2). Thus education remains a key factor in both the presence and
severity of pain.

7

These measures are consistent with an independent association between education and
pain, but we acknowledge that this analysis is more suggestive than definitive. For example,
income may be the important mediating factor which is correlated with education. However,
concerns about the endogeneity of income are particularly important here – especially in light
of Kapteyn, Smith, and van Soest (2006)’s finding that pain is a key mediating factor for
leaving the labor force. Similarly, we may be missing other measures of underlying health,
but again these are potentially endogenous (self-reported health is likely to be affected by the
perception of pain) or the consequence of ready access to primary care (knowing that one
suffers from hypertension). For these reasons, we turn to data on changes over time in the
prevalence of pain for patients all of whom are suffering from herniated discs, and with
detailed baseline data on the severity of their disease.

III. Changes over Time in Back Pain: The Maine Lumbar Spine Study
There is an extensive literature describing the epidemiology of back pain. One study
of Michigan workers found compensable back strains occurred in 1.7 percent of handlers and
laborers annually, compared to just 0.04 percent among executives (Gluck and Oleinick,
1998). But most studies do not find that physical tasks are the primary cause for chronic back
pain. Even after controlling carefully for differences in occupation, low-education workers in
Norway were far more likely to leave the labor force disabled (Hagen, et. al., 2000).
Similarly, there is a strong impact of education and income on days lost for homemakers, a
difference that seems unlikely to be explained entirely by differences in types of work
performed by homemakers with (e.g.) high versus low education (Deyo and Tsui-Wu, 2005).
One study of San Francisco transit workers suggest that while job tasks have some impact on

8

spinal injuries, other factors related to stress and psychosocial issues have more important
predictive powers.(Krause, et. al., 1998; also see Waddell, 2004).
The Maine study was a prospective observational study of patients presenting with
sciatica due to an intervertebral disc herniation (IDH) or lumbar spinal stenosis. Patients were
treated by orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and occupational medicine physicians in
community based practices throughout the state of Maine. Details about the study design,
methods, and outcomes have been published elsewhere (Keller, et. al., 1996; Atlas, et. al.,
1996; Atlas et. al., 2005). Our primary interest is in the 403 patients enrolled in the trial with
sciatica due to an intervertebral disc herniation (IDH) enrolled between 1990 and 1992, and
who were followed up after 10 years (or who died during the 10-year period).5 Because the
objective of the original study was to compare surgery with non-surgical treatments,
enrollment was stratified to obtain roughly equal numbers in these treatment groups. In
addition, oversampling of patients with IDH receiving workers' compensation was achieved
by enrolling patients from occupational medicine practices. (Thus the sample was not
designed to be representative of the general population with sciatica.) Specific radiographic
findings were not required for study entry but were available for about half of the patients.
For eligible consenting patients, baseline interviews were conducted in person
by trained research assistants, with follow-up obtained by mailed questionnaires. Physicians
completed a baseline questionnaire including history, physical examination findings,
diagnostic procedure results, and planned treatment. Patient data collected at baseline
included demographic information, employment and disability status, co-morbid conditions,
past spine history, symptoms, and functional status. Generic health status was assessed at

baseline with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item questionnaire (SF- 36). The
SF-36 describes 8 domains of health with each scored from 0 (poor health) to 100 (optimal
health).
We assessed two measures of pain and functioning specific to low back or leg pain,
which for editorial ease will be referred to as generic “back pain.” (The leg pain arises from
sciatica, a common symptom of IDH.) The first measure, the modified Roland-Morris Score,
assesses back-specific functional status which ranges from 0 to 23 depending on the number
of “true” responses to statements about how the patient’s life has been affected by back pain
(Patrick et al, 1995). Items include: “I stay at home most of the time because of my back,” “I
stand up for only short periods because of my back,” and “Because of back pain, I am more
irritable and bad tempered with people than usual.” (See the Appendix for the full set of
questions.) Questions may ask about difficulty in doing jobs around the house, but questions
about job issues or whether the back pain makes it difficult to work are avoided. Thus these
questions are not subject to the usual potential endogeneity arising from people reporting
illness to justify their non-working status.6
The second measure is the frequency of low back pain, leg pain, leg or foot weakness,
leg numbness, and leg pain after walking. There is a 7 point scale which we collapse to focus
just on the two most severe answers: “almost always” and “always.”7 Follow-up from year 5
to year 10 for the sample was very good, 352 of the original 403 people remained at the end
of the sample, with a small degree of attrition (3 percent) owing to death.

Although such reverse causation appears modest at best; see Benitez-Silva, et. al., 2004.

We first find the part of the body with the most severe pain and use that measure as our
summary score.

10

Table 4 presents summary statistics of key variables in the analysis, stratified by
education: no high school diploma (N = 47 at baseline, N = 35 for the 10-year follow-up),
high school graduates plus some college (N = 249 at baseline, 204 at follow-up), and college
graduates (N = 122 at baseline, 113 at follow-up). The average age in the sample was 40,
with little difference across educational groups. However, 15 percent of those without a high
school degree were female, compared to 39 percent among college graduates.
The Quebec Severity Score, a standard way to grade the severity of spine disorders
(Atlas, et. al., 1996), did not differ substantially at baseline across educational groups.
However, severe IDH based on an imaging test was higher for college graduates (15 percent)
compared to people who hadn’t finished high school (2 percent). These percentages are
relative to the entire population, including those for whom imaging tests were not available,
but the ratio of those with missing data was similar across educational groups; 45 percent for
people not finishing high school compared to 52 percent for high school and college
graduates.8
Baseline factors likely to predict poorer health outcomes were higher for those with
lower educational attainment. Fifty-seven percent of those without high school graduates
were smokers, significantly greater than 29 percent among college graduates. Similarly, other
markers of health, such as the SF36 bodily pain score and the SF36 physical function score,
were higher among people with more education. The baseline Roland-Morris score was
slightly worse among high school dropouts (16.8) and high school graduates (16.3) than
college graduates (14.6), but back pain was clearly disrupting normal life among all education
8

Missing data means that the researchers were not able to obtain records of the images, not
that the physician did not perform the imaging test. But even when imaging information is
not available, there are well-established clinical methods for diagnosing IDH based on (e.g.)
the presence of sciatica and physical examination findings.

11

groups. The percentage of people who “always” or “almost always” experienced back or leg
pain was 79 percent for those with high school education (or less), and 73 percent for college
graduates.9
Surgery is often used to treat IDH, although the clinical effects moderate over one to
two years (Atlas 1996, Weinstein, 2006a,b), and the benefits largely dissipate over a 10-year
period (Atlas, 2005, Weber 1983). Surgical procedure rates were 40 percent among high
school dropouts and 35 percent for those with college education (p = 0.78), so it is unlikely
that access to surgery per se can explain the educational gradient. Similarly, the percentage of
patients taking narcotic pain medicine did not differ significantly between the lowest and
highest education groups (p = 0.18).
The bottom of Table 4 includes the identical Roland-Morris and pain measures,
measured 10 years later. On average, respondents are far better off than they were at baseline.
And here the educational gradient becomes quite pronounced (p < .01), with an average
Roland-Morris Score of 3.4 for college graduates, half the value for high school graduates
(8.0) and one-third the average for those not finishing high school (10.8). Similarly, the
percentage reporting pain always or almost always ranges from 34 percent for people without
a high school degree to just 9 percent for college graduates (p < .01).
The differences in pain outcomes by education hold across the entire distribution of
disabling pain. Figure 3 shows the distribution of Roland-Morris measures by education,
broken into four groups; little pain (< 4 questions answered in the affirmative), mild (4 – 9
questions), moderate (10 – 15) and severe (16 – 23). Just 27 percent of respondents without a
high school degree report little pain, fewer than those reporting severe pain (30 percent). By
9

There was also a higher 10-year rate of mortality among the lowest education group (6
percent compared to the average of 3 percent).

12

contrast, among college graduates 68 percent report little pain, substantially more than the 5
percent who continue with severe pain.
We therefore consider the association between pain and education in a multivariate
context, with the general model written as
Yi = X i β + Z i γ + Eiα + u i
where Yi is the pain outcome at year 10 following baseline for individual i, Xi represents
individual-specific characteristics such as age and sex, Zi is the set of baseline severity
characteristics such as imaging results, initial pain levels, and comorbidities, while Ei is a
matrix of categorical measures of education.
Least squares regression results are presented in Table 5, with the excluded
educational category corresponding to 11 years of education or fewer. In Column (1), which
controls just for sex and age, the coefficient for college graduates is -7.32 (p < .01), and for
high school graduates, -2.69 (p < .05). Column (2), which adds a limited set of baseline
covariates (Z) raises the R2 from 0.15 to 0.25, with smoking, the presence of comorbidities,
and the baseline Roland-Morris Score, significant and in the expected direction. (One might
interpret the baseline Roland-Morris Score as also capturing individual-level heterogeneity in
the overall perception of pain.) The education gradient is somewhat less steep; the
coefficient for college graduates is now -5.83 (p < .01). Finally, adding all baseline and
treatment covariates (Column 3) has little impact on the coefficient for college education
(-5.32, p < .01).
The Roland-Morris pain measure may be a little difficult to interpret, but the measure
of whether one experiences back/leg pain “almost always” or “always” (that is, severe pain)
may be easier to intuit. (Least-squares regression is used for ease of interpretation, but probit

13

regressions yielded similar results.) As shown in Column (4) in Table 5, the education
gradient is a 24 percentage point difference in the percentage of people reporting severe pain
between those in the highest and lowest education group. After controlling for all baseline
measures, the corresponding gap is still 13 percentage points, as shown in Column (5). While
this coefficient is marginally significant for those with college education, and not significant
at all for high school graduates, the corresponding estimates are highly significant using an
ordered probit equation with all responses to the question, from never experiencing back-leg
pain to always experiencing it.

IV. Discussion and Conclusion
In this paper, we have explored the association between pain and education, and found
first that the prevalence of pain exhibits a strong association with education among older (age
50 plus) Americans in the HRS. While previous occupation and industry, as well as marital
status, accounts for some of this correlation, there remains a strong and persistent association,
at least among ages 50-79.
We also considered how education was associated with the resolution of pain over
time. The Maine study included patients with an IDH, a condition which has a specific pain
complex that is verifiable in most cases based upon examination and imaging findings (Atlas
2006). Thus, unlike non-specific low back pain in which examination and imaging findings
are less reliable, IDH represents a specific low back disorder in which it is more difficult for
patients to report sciatic pain without evidence for an underlying clinical disorder (Atlas
2007). Nevertheless, after 10 years, patients with lower educational levels report more pain
and functional disability despite objective evidence for the same underlying clinical condition

14

and similar or less severe findings. These effects suggest that education matters for changes
over time in pain, and swamp any impact of medical or surgical treatments for IDH.
Economists and other social scientists have become increasing interested in the
measurement of both health and well-being. Typically health has been measured using
diseases known to the respondent (such as hypertension or diabetes), actual measures of blood
pressure, hemoglobin A1c,(e.g., Banks, et. al., 2006), and activities of daily living (ADLs) and
instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). These are relatively objective measures that,
absent measurement error, should be stable, trend with age, or shift in response to health
events. At the other end of the spectrum is “well-being,” which is inherently subjective, and
is typically measured by asking respondents about their happiness or satisfaction with their
life, or with more focused approaches such as day reconstruction diaries which asks
respondents to describe their day and how they felt during each episode (Kahneman, et. al.,
2004). Subjective measures have their drawbacks, however, as they can be sensitive to
seemingly irrelevant factors such as whether the weather was nice on the day of the survey
(Kahneman and Krueger, 2006).
Pain lies somewhere between these two approaches. The study of pain, both in clinical
and laboratory settings, occupies a very large literature, with several journals devoted solely
to this topic, but economists do not typically consider it.10 Though pain is self-reported,
quantitative measures of pain and its impact have been validated and are widely used (Patrick
et al, 1995; Deyo et al 1998; Bombardier, 2000), and prospects for more objective measures
of pain using scans of brain activity are improving but are still controversial (Miller, 2009).
10

For example, the eponymous journal Pain publishes 21 issues per year. A jstor.org search
of the word “pain” in all economics journals (in either the abstract or the title) yielded no
relevant matches; a typical unrelated matche was an 1894 article in the Quarterly Journal of
Economics by David I. Green entitled “Pain-Cost and Opportunity-Cost.”
15

In an analysis of country-level averages of pain and happiness, countries with the
highest reported pain levels (e.g., Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Bulgaria)
also tended to do worse on measures of happiness and life satisfaction (Blanchflower, 2008).
It is perhaps not surprising that there is a close association between pain and subjective wellbeing, as in Krueger and Stone (2008). Krueger et al. (2007) have recently proposed a new
index measuring the fraction of time spent in an “unpleasant” state, which includes episodes
of pain. Furthermore, there is neurological evidence that chronic pain has long-lasting effects
on the organization and functioning of the brain, including atrophy (Apkarian, et al., 2004;
Apkarian, Baliki, and Geha, 2009).
Subjective measures of pain have been viewed with suspicion by economists, given
the possibility of people who aren’t working or eligible for disability insurance justifying their
work status by claiming disabling pain. Questions are often framed to encourage such an
interpretation – for example, asking the respondent whether they have a disability which
prevents them from working. Most recently, Benitez-Silva, et al. (2004) suggests little selfreporting bias, and in any case none of the questions considered here are related to work
decisions. Instead they ask about how general pain (HRS) or specific aspects of back pain
with respect to sleeping, walking, or household tasks (see Appendix).
In the clinical and neurological literature, there is an increased recognition that organic
signs of injury are not necessary for real pain to occur (Chou et. al., 2007). Atul Gawande
(2002) described the case of Rowland Scott Quinlan, an architect who in his 50s was stricken
with reoccurring back pain. Numerous physicians could find no physical explanation. There
was no financial reason for him to fake pain, but Gawande nonetheless asked his wife about
whether she thought he ever faked it:

16

She has seen the pain defeat him in ways that she knows he is too proud to
fake. He’ll try to carry the groceries, and then, shamefaced, have to hand
them back a few moments later. Though he loves movies, they have not
been to the cinema in years. There have been times when the pain of
movement has been so severe that he has soiled his pants rather than make
his way to the bathroom. (p. 117)
While Mr. Quinlin continued to work as best he could, for most people this type of pain leads
to disability which in turn leads to a total withdrawal from the labor force (Kapteyn, Smith,
and van Soest, 2006).
Recall in the Maine study that nearly everyone in the sample was in severe pain at
baseline, with most making the transition from acute pain to recovery. The key puzzle is why
the fraction of people making the unhappy transition into long-term chronic pain (and often
permanent disability) is so much higher for people with lower educational attainment. A
number of studies have pointed to psychological factors as being of primary importance for
this transition, for example depressive symptoms and a belief that the pain being experienced
will remain permanent (Casey et al., 2008), and these might be associated with education.
Others have pointed to more fundamental differences in brain functioning between
chronic pain sufferers and those who recover. Using fMRI scans and other approaches,
neuroscientists have argued that chronic back pain (CBP) is associated with fundamental
chemical changes in the brain that leads to heightened activity in the medial prefrontal cortex
(along with a decline in gray matter density in other parts of the prefrontal cortex), with these
factors accounting for roughly three-quarters of the variation in the intensity and duration of
chronic back pain (Balaki, et al., 2006). That areas of the brain affected by chronic pain are
also regions associated with emotion and memory is particularly intriguing. While there is
some suggestive evidence suggesting that brain structure differs by socioeconomic status (see

17

Hackman and Farah, 2009), the differences do not appear to be sufficiently consistent and
large to explain the results we find in the data.
Perhaps a more fruitful explanation for the observed socioeconomic differences in
pain is the idea that it is affected by social norms or economic factors, perhaps drawing on
the insight that regions of the brain affected by pain are also associated with emotion.
Gawande (2002) recounted the “epidemic” of repetition strain injury (RSI) in Australia
during the 1980s:
This was not a mild case of writer’s cramp but a matter of severe pain,
which started with minor discomfort during typing or other repetitive
work and progressed to invalidism. The average time that a sufferer
lost from work was seventy-four days. As with chronic back pain, no
consistent physical abnormality or effective treatment could be found,
yet the arm pain spread like a contagion. (p. 128)
There were widespread outbreaks of this syndrome, with some factories or states being
affected in large numbers and others passed by. However, by 1987, the epidemic was over,
with observers viewing the most important reasons being that the syndrome was out of favor
with physicians, and that it became harder to receive disability payments because of the RSI.
While the evidence presented here is suggestive rather than definitive, it does raise questions
about the interaction between the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, the
perception of pain, and social norms. Indeed, Hadler, Tait, and Chibnall (2007) have
proposed that chronic back pain often evolves in response to the strong incentives inherent in
the U.S. workers’ compensation system, while Gawande’s description of the Australian RSI
epidemic is explicit in pointing to a social contagion model along the lines of Glaeser,
Scheinkman, and Sacerdote (1996, 2003) or Rege et al. (2008).
This paper is just a first step in trying to better understand the economic and social
implications of pain. Our ongoing research is focusing on changes over time in the

18

prevalence of pain and how these trends may be associated with social programs such as the
SSDI program. The evidence from this paper suggests that we need to better understand why
low educational attainment translates into something more than the risk of a dead-end job -the risk also of a life ruined by chronic long-term pain.
