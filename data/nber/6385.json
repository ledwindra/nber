    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines an empirical regularity found in many societies: that family influences on the probability of transiting from one grade level to the next diminish at higher levels of education.  We examine the statistical model used to establish the empirical regularity and the intuitive behavioral interpretation often used to rationalize it.  We show that the implicit economic model assumes myopia.  The intuitive interpretive model is identified only by imposing arbitrary distributional assumptions onto the data.  We produce an alternative choice-theoretic model with fewer parameters that rationalizes the same data and is not based on arbitrary distributional assumptions.\n\n",
