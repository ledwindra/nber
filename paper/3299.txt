DOES FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION MATTER?
DISENTANGLING THE PORTFOLIO AND EXPECTATIONS EFFECTS FOR THE MARX

ABSTRACT

The time is ripe for a re-examination of the

question whether foreign
exchange intervention can affect the exchange rate. We attempt to isolate
two distinct effects: the portfolio effect, whereby an increase in the
supply of marks must reduce the dollar/mark rate (for given expected rates
of return) and the additional expectations effect, whereby intervention
that is publically known may alter investors expectations of the future
exchange rate, which will feed back to the current equilibrium price. We
estimate a system consisting of two equations, one describing investors'
portfolio behavior and the other their formation of expectations, where the
two endogenous variables are the current spot rate and investors'
expectation of the future spot rate. We use relatively new data sources:
actual daily data on intervention by the Bundesbank, newspaper stories on
known intervention, and survey data on investors' expectations. We find
evidence of both an expectations effect and a portfolio effect. The
statistical significance of the portfolio effect suggests that even
sterilized intervention may have had positive effects during the sample
period. (It tends to be significant only during the later of our two
sample periods, October 1984 to December 1987. That intervention appears
less significant statistically during the earlier period, November 1982 to
October 1984, could be attributed to the fact that little intervention was
undertaken until 1985.)
For the magnitude of the effects to be large
requires that intervention be publically known. Our (still preliminary)
estimates suggest that a typical $100 million of "secret" intervention has
an effect of less than 0.1 per Cent on the exchange rate, but that the
effect of news reports of intervention can be as large as an additional 4
per cent.

Introduction

Until recently, there was an unusual degree of consensus among
economists, and among policy-makers and participants in the financial
markets as well, that intervention by central banks in the foreign exchange
market did not offer an effective or lasting instrument for affecting the

exchange rate, at least not independently of monetary policy. The 1982 G-7
economic summit at Versailles commissioned a study of intervention, known
as the Jurgenson report, which found that the effects were small and
transitory at most.2
We think that the time is ripe for new statistical testing of the

question. Many policy-makers and foreign exchange traders believe that the
intervention operations that have taken place since the Plaza Agreement of

September 1985 have had an effect. Moreover, the theoretical case against
the effectiveness of intervention is not as clear as a reading of the
economics literature might suggest.

The academic literature is predicated on the distinction between
intervention operations that are sterilized and those that are not

sterilized. Intervention operations that change the supplies of domestic

and foreign money are considered nonsterilized. Sterilized intervention
operations, in contrast, are accompanied by offsetting open-market
operations which return the relevant money supply to its original level.

In this paper we do not concentrate on this distinction. We study the
intervention operations that actually took place between 1982 and 1987,

Many of the econometric results, finding little or no effect, were
reported in Rogoff (1984) and Henderson and Sampson (1983).

regardless of whether they were sterilized.

But we do begin in section II

with a review of the issues involved.3
In this paper we examine the two possible channels through which
intervention (whether sterilized or not) can influence the foreign exchange
rate; the portfolio and the expectations channels.

Intervention can, even

if sterilized, influence exchange rates through the portfolio channel
provided foreign and domestic bonds are considered imperfect substitutes in

investor's portfolios. Intervention operations that, for example, increase
the current relative supply of mark to dollar assets that private investors
are obliged to accept into their portfolios, will force a decrease in the
relative price of mark assets.4 Intervention can also influence exchange

rates, regardless of whether foreign and domestic bonds are imperfect

substitutes, through the expectations channel. The public information that
central banks are intervening in support of a currency (or are planning to
intervene in the future) may. under certain conditions, cause speculators
to expect an increase in the price of that currency in the future.

Speculators react to this information by buying the currency today.
bringing about the change In the exchange rate today.

While some previous empirical studies of foreign exchange
intervention operations have found evidence from daily data that central
banks have had a statistically significant effect on exchange rates
(Loopesko (1984) and Dominguez (1987,1989)), the studies were not able to
distinguish whether the effect was coming through the portfolio or the

expectations channel. The goal of this study is to disentangle the
influence of the two potential channels during the most recent experience

with central bank intervention operations. The empirical work was made
possible by an agreement with the German Bundesbank allowing use of

confidential daily intervention data over the period l982-l987. While the
Fed did not grant us official access to their daily intervention data over
this period, we constructed a daily intervention series for the U.S.
(including both Federal Reserve and Treasury initiated operations) from
descriptions of foreign exchange desk operations published in the Federal
Reserve

sank

of New York Quarterly Review (FNYQR) and other Federal Reserve

publications.

The present study brings three distinct sources of information (related
to past work by the authors] to bear on the effects of intervention.
First, we measure expectations of the future spot exchange rate by means of
survey data on the forecasts of market participants. These data were
introduced in another Context by Frankel and Froot (1987) and Dominguez

(1986).6 Second, we use daily newspaper reports of intervention and
related news to distinguish public awareness of intervention operations, a
prerequisite for the expectations channel to be operative, from actual
intervention operations, a prerequisite for the portfolio channel to be

operative. Third, in the relationship connecting asset supplies to the
risk premium, we impose the constraint that the coefficient is

proportionate to the time-varying variance of the exchange rate, as it
should be if investors choose their portfolios to diversify optimally.
These additional sources of information allow us to estimate a twoequation system: an expectations-formation equation

and a portfolio-

diversification equation. Our novel conclusion, based on our findings

for

the dollar/mark exchange rate, is that both the portfolio and expectations
channels were effective during the sample period.

II. The Standard Theory: Sterilized vs. Nonsterilized Intervention
There are three standard arguments as to why the effects of
intervention should be very small: the small size of intervention relative
to the total market, Ricardian equivalence, and high international asset

substitutability. The latter two, if valid, imply that the effects of
sterilized intervention should be small or zero. The first implies

that

the effects of intervention should be relatively small even if
nonsterilized.

While the scale of intervention operations in recent years is
unprecedented, it remains small relative to the stocks or flows in the

foreign exchange market. A census of the volume of foreign exchange
trading recently released by the New York Fed reported a total of $129
billion per day (eliminating double-counting) in the United States in April

1989. Adding in London and Tokyo, the total exceeds $430 billion. Daily
positions taken by banks and other individual institutions are much

smaller than the gross positions. However, the total net stocks

of

currencies that could in theory be brought into the market at any time are
considerably larger. U.S. 112, for example, currently exceeds $3,000

billion. By comparison the average coovdinated intervention operation

4

in

support of the dollar during the period January 1985 to December 1987
involved $256 million, while the average coordinated sale of dollars
involved $208 million (Dominguez (1989), p.3k).

Standard models of exchange rate determination at least allow nonsterilized intervention to have an effect on the exchange rate in
proportion to the change in the relative supplies of domestic and foreign

money, just as any other form of monetary policy does. The idea that
sterilized intervention operations, on the other hand, have any effect at

all, is less accepted. Those that conclude that sterilized intervention
can have no effect, base their arguments on either "Ricardian equivalence"

or the high substitutability between foreign and domestic bonds. We
consider these two arguments in turn.

If government bonds imply the public liability of future taxation to
service them, and if investors look far into the future, optimize
intertemporally, and internalize the welfare of future generations, then
government bonds are not true "outside" assets; they have no more effect on
market equilibrium than the issue of an IOU by one private citizen to

another. If government bonds are not true outside assets, it follows that
swaps in their currency composition have no effect on the foreign exchange
market equilibrium.

7

There are many arguments against Ricardian equivalence, both
theoretical and empirical; it is the sort of proposition that one would

like to test rather than impose. In any case, in recent years the lines of
distinction between "money" and "bonds" have become increasingly blurred.
It is not clear that the creation of a Money Market Deposit Account --

For example, Frankel (1979) and Backus and Kehoe (1988).
5

which is part of M2. but is the liability of a privately-owned financial
institution rather than of the government - -

should

have a fully

proportionate effect on the exchange rate, while the issue of a Treasury
Bill has no effect.

Even if it is granted that government bonds are "outside" assets, the
second line of argument against the effectiveness of sterilized
intervention is that domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes, so
that changes in their relative supply have no effect.8 A less extreme
version of the argument is that substitutability is very high, even if not
literally infinite, so that intervention (in the relevant magnitudes) can

have very little effect quantitatively. One point that is often missed is
that, even if it is true that the effect of sterilized intervention on the
differential in rates of return is very close to zero, the effect on the

level of the exchange rate may be relatively large. As long as changes in
bond supplies matter, they should have a proportionate effect on the
exchange rate (which is the relative price of foreign bonds, in the
portfolio model, not just the relative price of money) in the absence of
changes in the risk premium, no matter how high the degree of
substitutability.

Even for those who hold either to Ricardian equivalence or to the
assumption that foreign and domestic bonds are perfect substitutes, there
remains a channel whereby sterilized intervention can have an effect on

exchange rates.

Intervention operations can effect exchange rates through

the signalling channel if they are used by central banks as a means of

conveying (or signalling) to the market inside information about future

monetary policy. If market participants believe central bank intervention
signals, then even though today's money supply has not changed,

expectations of future monetary policy will change. When the market
revises its expectations of future money supplies, it also revises its
expectations of the future spot exchange rate, which brings about a change

in the current rate. The signalling channel is thus one example of the

expectations channel mentioned in the preceding section)0
It is known that daily intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York is fully and automatically sterilized: the foreign exchange trading
room immediately reports its dollar sales to the open market trading room,
which then buys that many fewer bonds, so that the daily money supply is

precisely what it would have been if no intervention had occurred. This
leaves open the possibility that a Federal Reserve Board decision to try to
influence the exchange rate will result in both intervention and a

different money supply, say on a monthly basis. To the extent that the
market learns about such decisions by observing intervention, that is a

case of the signalling hypothesis. Trying to test the signalling
hypothesis by observing what happens to the money supply ex post, in finite

samples, would be a dubious way of approaching the question. Intervention
is at best but one of many factors relevant for determining the future
money supply; in finite samples the relationship might not be detectable.
This is especially true of one particular argument why an increase in the

supply of government debt today implies an increase in the money supply in

the future. The Sargent-Wallace 'unpleasant monetarist arithmetic," which
says that an increase in debt may be explosive if it is not eventually
monetized, might not take effect until far after the end of the sample
period.

The Bundesbank and other smaller central banks are less prone to
complete sterilization than are the U.S. authorities; during periods of
undesired dollar weakness, the Bundesbank often buys dollars for marks, and
to some extent allows the increase in reserves to swell the German money

supply. In this study, we do not prejudge the sterilization question.

To

summarize, the expectations channel may or may not require that

intervention be allowed to affect future money supplies. The portfolio
channel presumably would require that sterilized intervention be effective,
but we allow the data to tell us whether this channel is in fact operative.

The portfolio-balance theory says that investors diversify their
holdings among domestic and foreign assets --

functions of expected rates of return. Measuring the expected rates of
return requires both data on interest rates, which is easy, and data on

investors' expectations of exchange rate changes, which is very hard. Some
early tests assumed away this problem by setting expected depreciation
equal to zero, and simply looking for a relationship between the level of
the exchange rate and the supplies of domestic and foreign assets.11 But,

attempt, with better measures of asset supplies, is Golub (1989).

even aside from the expectations problem, these studies were plagued by a
second econometric difficulty: simultaneity.'2
A regression specification that avoids this simultaneity problem takes
the dependent variable to be the differential in expected rates of return
between domestic and foreign assets, rather than the level of the exchange
rate, and uses ex cost changes in the exchange rate to measure investors'

expectations by invoking the methodology of rational expectations.'3 Begin
by considering the asset-demand function that determines the portfolio
share x that is allocated to mark assets, as a function of the risk premium

The special case where domestic and foreign assets are perfect substitutes

Coefficients on asset supplies often appeared statistically
significant, but with the wrong signs. When the Bundesbank reacts to an
increase in the dollar/mark rate by buying dollar assets and selling mark
assets, an apparent perverse relationship between the exchange rate and the
supply of dollar assets results.

The regression estimate of the coefficient b in equation (3) is
generally found to be insignificantly different from zero, a failure to
reject the null hypothesis of perfect substitutability.14 One

possible

explanation for this result is that there is insufficient power in the

test. One way of bringing additional information to bear is to assume

that

investors choose their portfolio allocation, x, to optimize a function of
the mean and variance of end-of-period wealth, from which it follows that
'equation (1) holds with a constraint imposed: the coefficient is inversely
proportionate to v, the variance of the return differential)5 In the case
where goods prices are nonstochastic, v is simply the variance of the
exchange rate, and a, the minimum-variance portfolio, is closely related to

the share of German goods in the consumption basket of the investor. The
inverted form, equation (3), becomes:

14

At least that is what studies find when assets supplies x are
computed to include not only foreign exchange intervention, but also
government budget deficits, and other forms of asset creation that usually
dwarf intervention in magnitude. tE.g., Dooley and Isard (1983), Frankel
(1982a), and Roothe, Clinton, Cote, and Longworth (l985). Studies that
focus more narrowly on daily changes in asset supplies through foreign
exchange intervention do sometimes find an effect on the differential in
rates of return: Loopesko (1984) and Doainguez (1989).

where we have defined r to be the constant of proportionality, which is the
coefficient of relative risk-aversion.16
The rational expectations methodology assumes that the regression error

and forecast error are identical, so that the equation can be estimated
subject to the constraint that the coefficient is proportionate to the

variance of the error term. Despite the presumed increase in power, the
empirical literature generally fails to reject the null hypothesis of
perfect substitutability, which is now interpreted as risk-neutrality

(r—O))7 This finding is the same when the variance v is allowed to vary
over time, as in the popular ARCH models.18
Notwithstanding the elegance of the rational expectations methodology,
several econometric problems remain in the estimation of an equation like

(4), and they may be responsible for the results. First, the asset
supplies x may be measured with error, or the asset demand equation (1) may

hold only subject to an error term. In theory, either source of error
would be fairly easy to handle, provided that the error (like investors'

This is the simplified form of the equation in Dornbusch (1983),

that a correct treatment of the convexity term that arises from Jensen's
Inequality makes the Constant term -(ra - a + l/2)v, instead of -a(rv). In
what follows, the variable in the regression is v in either case, and it is
only the interpretation of its coefficient that is affected.

IV. gxpectations. and Our 'Two-EQuation System

The second set of econometric difficulties with estimating equation (4)
concern the measurement of the expectations variable in the risk premium.
Even if the rational expectations methodology Is valid, i.e, the forecast
error e is uncorrelated in-sample with all other contemporaneous variables,
there Is the undeniable problem that the magnitude of the error term is

extremely large. This could lead to low power: a failure to reject riskneutrality even though the coefficient of risk-aversion is in reality

greater than zero. Furthermore, there is reason to think that ex post
changes in the exchange rate are a particularly bad measure of what

Investors expected ex an. Independent estimates of market forecasts of
exchange rates, drawn from survey data, suggest that expected depreciation
varies closely with the forward discount, while ex post changes in the
exchange rate do not, and tend if anything to lie in precisely the opposite

direction.21 We choose to measure expectations by using the survey data
rather than cx post changes, on the grounds that (a) the evidence of bias

variable that will help us estimate the equation is the one that captures

is damaging for the latter, and (b) the magnitude of the measurement error
is almost certainly larger for ex yost changes than for the survey data.
Thus the equation now becomes:
DM

$

tt+k

+

t+k — a(rv) + (rv)x + Utk.

where the error term u is now meant to reflect any measurement error in the

data, rather than investors' forecasting errors. In light of the many
studies concluding that exchange rate changes have variances that are
autocorrelated over time, we choose to estimate the variance v as the daily

variance of exchange rate changes over the preceding week. To our
knowledge, despite the incipient spread of the use of the survey data, they
have not been used together with data on asset supplies and variances to
estimate a risk premium equation.

Equation (6), which captures the portfolio channel through which
intervention may have an effect, is only one of two equations in the system

we estimate. The other is an equation of expectations formation, where the
dependent variable, investors' forecast of the expected future spot rate,
is measured using the survey data.

Past work with the survey data shows clearly that the expected future
spot rate, in general, fluctuates roughly one-for-one in proportion to the

most recent realized spot rate. But other factors enter the equation as
well. Frankel and Froot (1987,1988) considered in turn three possible
alternative candidates for the other factor: (I) the lagged spot rate, in
which case the specification is extrapolative expectations, (2) the lagged
expectation, in which case the specification is adaptive expectations, and
(3) a long-run equilibrium measured by Purchasing Power Parity, in which

13

case the specification is regressive expectations. In each case, the
variable in question entered with statistical significance.22
Although a number of different surveys at different horizons are
available, we use here the 1-week and 4-week ahead survey forecasts
conducted by Money Market Services, International, for the period October

24, 1984 to December 18, 1987. Unlike some other surveys, it is conducted
on a weekly basis (since July 1985; before that it was conducted every two

weeks). Longer horizons do not seem relevant for the majority of trading
in the foreign exchange market.23

In addition, we report results for the earlier period November 17,
1982, to October 10, 1984, when the survey was conducted every two weeks

and pertains to 3-month ahead forecasts. One might expect that
intervention would have a greater effect in the later period, since the
Reagan Administration's firm commitment to free-floating began to change

when Don Regan and ery1 Sprinkel were succeeded at the Treasury by James
Baker and Richard Darman in January 1985 and when the Plaza Agreement
followed in September.

24

22

Its coefficient is only positive, with a slightly less-than-unit
coefficient on the contemporaneous spot rate, when the forecast horizon is
3 months or longer.
23

There is evidence that most foreign exchange trading takes place
among banks, with rapid turnover and correspondingly short investment
horizons. The recent New York Fed census of foreign exchange trading found
that in April 1989 only 4.9 per cent of banks' trading was with a
nonfinancial firm. In other words, banks trade with each other much more
than with ultimate customers. See Goodhart (1988) and Frankel and Froot
(1988) for more on this theme.
24

The Germans began to intervene seriously to try to push the dollar
down in February 1985 (Funabashl. (1988)).

14

The specification we choose here is general in that it allows for both
extrapolative and adaptive expectations. At the 4-week horizon,
respondents have been observed to put negative weight on the lagged spot
rate and more-than-unit weight on the contemporaneous spot rate, so that
they are extrapolating the recent trend into the future to get their
forecast.

25

Previous work has also found evidence that respondents form

their predictions adaptively, putting positive weight on the lagged survey

prediction (Frankel and Froot (1987)). Finally, we also include a constant
term in the expectations equation, to represent the long-term equilibrium
toward which investors may expect the spot rate to regress (or away from
which investors may expect the spot rate to explode, as the case may be).
The fourth variable in our expectations equation is a NEWS variable
meant to capture information appearing in the newspaper about the central

bank's exchange rate policy. NEWS is set equal to +1 if there were reports
of central bank action in support of the dollar, -1 if there were reports
of action against the dollar, and 0 if there were no such reports. Thus we
expect NEWS to have a negative effect on expectations of the future
dollar/mark rate.

The NEWS variable included not only reports of actual

intervention but also, for example, official statements by Treasury and
Central Bank officials that they would like the exchange rate to go in a

25

Frankel and Froot (1988). Models based on technical analysis
(which often essentially extrapolate past trends) are more widely-used by
professional forecasting services, especially at short horizons, than
models based on macroeconomic fundamentals (which could be viewed as
regressive expectations). Euromoney magazine runs a yearly review of
foreign exchange forecasting services; of 27 firms covered in 1988, 12
used only technical models, only I relied exclusively on fundamentals
models, and 12 used a combination of the two techniques.

particular direction, or that a G-7 meeting may be scheduled in response to
exchange rate worries.

We also include a variable for "reported intervention" equal to a dummy
variable for newspaper reports of intervention (a subset of the reports
captured by the NEWS variable) multiplied by the amount of true

intervention. This variable allows us to quantify the difference between
publically known intervention of a given size and discrete (so-called
"stealth," or secret) intervention.

The second equation in our system is thus:

5t+k't — a0 +

+ cc2(at 1÷k + X3NEWSt + cz4REPI

+

(7)

where '+k is log of the ?*IS survey prediction of the spot rate in period

t+k, a is the log of the contemporaneous spot rate, s_ is the log of the
spot rate on the day of the last MNS survey, NEWSt is a (1,0,-i) dummy
variable which captures reports of exchange rate policy news, and PEPIt is

reported Bundesbank and Fed intervention measured in dollars. We choose to
date the "contemporaneous" spot rate at 7:00 a.m. EST, so that we can be
sure that it is known to market participants when they formulate the
forecasts that they report to MMS International the next morning.
Nevertheless simultaneity may be a problem: if demand for dollars relative
to marks at 7:00 a.m. EST is in part determined by expectations reflected

in the next mornings survey, then the contemporaneous spot rate S

is

endogenous. But our set-up is designed to deal with precisely this

problem: we have two endogenous variables, a and s, and two

equations

to

be estimated simultaneously. In terms of the identification problem, the
exogenous variables that are excluded from equation (7) and that can serve

16

as instrumental variables for s are the variance v and the total quantity
of marks sold in foreign exchange intervention (measured in marks) 1DM.

V. The Estimation Results
The regression results for the expectation equation (7) and the

portfolio equation (6) are presented in six pairs of tables. All tables
with the "A" suffix present regression results over the period November
1982 through October 1984 using 3-month-ahead survey expectations of the

dollar/mark exchange rate. Tables with the "B" suffix present results over
the period October 1984 through December 1987 using 1-month-ahead survey

expectations. [Results using 1-week-ahead survey expectations also over
the latter period are presented in the Appendix.) Further, in the first
three pairs of tables we present single-equation estimates to provide a

basis for comparison. The instrumental variable estimates for the two
equations are presented in the second three pairs of tables. Finally, in
all of the tables we present results for three measures of the intervention

variable. "1-day" intervention is Fed and Bundesbank purchases of dollars
on the day before the survey. "14-day' or "7-day"

intervention

is

cumulated between survey dates, so that it measures total Fed and

Bundesbank dollar purchases since the last survey. "Total" intervention is
cuniulated from the beginning of the sample period and therefore measures

the relative stock supplies of outside assets denominated in dollar and
mark currencies.

We begin with the expectations equation (7), reported in Tables 1A,B

and 4A,B. When equation (7) is estimated by OLS allowing for a serial
correlation correction (Tables IA,B), the coefficient on the difference
between the lagged and contemporaneous spot rate is always negative, as in

17

the destabilizing extrapolative

model.26 The estimated extrapolative

coefficient tends to be larger in magnitude when the regression is
estimated using instrumental variables to correct for endogeneity of the
spot rate (Tables 4A,B).

The coefficient on the adaptive term (the

difference between the lagged survey prediction and contemporaneous spot
rate) is, in contrast, always positive indicating that expectations are

stabilizing. Again, the estimated adaptive coefficient tends to be larger
in magnitude in the instrumented regressions.

The absolute values of the

estimated coefficients on the extrapolative and adaptive terms in the
regressions are similar in magnitude making it difficult to access whether
expectations are, on net, destabilizing or stabilizing;

but the former seem

to dominate during the key 1985-87 period.

The more interesting finding in the context of the signalling
hypothesis is that the coefficient on the NEWS variable usually appears
statistically significant for the one- and three-month horizon
expectations, and of the correct sign: newspaper reports of prospective
intervention In support of the dollar and related stories
expectations of the future dollar/mark exchange rate.

tend to lower

The average news

effect on the 1-month ahead expectations of the dollar mark exchange rate

is on the order of .005 to .007 per cent. This is true both for the 01.5
estimates (Table 16) and for the instrumental variables estimates (Table

46). The reported intervention variable is significant in two of the three
instrumented regressions for the latter sample period (table 46).

We now turn to the risk-premium, the portfolio equation (6).
present OLS regression results for (6) in Tables 2A,B and 3A,B and
26 These are similar to estimates in Frankel and Froot (1988).

We

instrumental variable results in Tables SA,B and 6A,S. The intervention
variable (defined as x in the text) is expressed in each of two alternative
possible ways: in terms of millions of dollars' in Tables 2A,S and SA,B,
and as a percent of total wealth U in Tables 3A,S and 6A.B. (Wealth, U, is
measured as the total supply of U.S. and German federal goverruaent debt

that has been issued and so must be held in investors' portfolios.)

The

first alternative is the approach of Loopesko (1984) and Dominguez

(1987,1989). In the case when the intervention variable is simply
expressed in number of dollars bought on the foreign exchange market (times

the variance), its coefficient should be interpreted as nW. rather than

simply as r. The second alternative -

- which

is the approach of Dooley and

Isard (1982,1983), Frankel (l982a,1982b), and Soothe, Clinton, Cote and
Longworth (1985) -

- is

more in accordance with the asset-market theory of

exchange rate determination; but it has in the past turned out less likely
to give "goode results: intervention is in practice dwarfed by government

deficits and other sources of changes in asset supplies. Finally, in the
regressions where intervention is expressed as percent of wealth, we
further disaggregate the data by including Bundesbank and Fed intervention

separately. The three separate sets of regressions, therefore, include
intervention measured as the sum

of

Bundesbank and Fed intervention

intervention by the Sundesbank IBS• and intervention by the Fed IFED.27

27

While the magnitudes of the coefficient estimates on the
intervention variable (however defined) of course change dramatically
depending on whether intervention is expressed in millions of dollars or as
a percent of wealth, the statistical significance of the coefficient is
consistent across the two definitions. We therefore, in the interest of
space, do not include regression results for Fed and Sundesbank
intervention, separately, expressed in millions of dollars.
19

Begin with the OLS estimates [tables 2 and 31.

When intervention is

measured either between surveys or on the day before the survey in the
latter sample period, the effect of the variance of spot changes on the
risk premium is generally statistically significant at the 95 per cent

level. This finding is itself of interest.28 But our primary focus here
is on the effect of intervention, and it is not statistically significant
for the October 1982 -

October 1984 sample period. Again, this is not

surprising, as the sample size is small and this was the period when there
was no official U.S. support for intervention.29 But even for the later
sample period, the OLS regressions show significance only for the effects
of 1-day intervention on the 1.month-term risk premium.
As discussed earlier, the single equation estimates of the portfolio
regression are vulnerable to concerns of simultaneity bias due to the
endogeneity of the spot exchange rate, used to translate the marks sold in
intervention into dollar terms so as to be able to divide by wealth

expressed in dollars. That is why we report simultaneous-equation
estimates of equation (6) in tables SA,B and 6A,B, using as instruments:
last week's spot rate, the NEWS variable, and the reported component of
Bundesbank and Fed intervention.

During the later period, October 1984 to

December 1987, the coefficient on intervention estimated by instrumental
variables is generally statistically significant, regardless of whether it

Domowitz and Hakkio (1985) test for a relationship between the
variance and the risk premium, with the latter defined using the
conventional rational expectations methodology.

Indeed, what little U.S. intervention there was shows up with a
high standard error and the wrong sign when Bundesbank and Fed intervention
are included separately in the regressions.

20

is expressed in millions of dollars (Table 56) or as a percent of wealth

(Table 6B).°
Tables 7 and 8 present OLS and instrumental variable estimates,

respectively, over the latter sample period for an unconstrained version of
the portfolio equation (equation (3)) that enters the variance and asset
supplies linearly, rather than constraining them to enter in multiplicative

form.31 The OLS results in Table 7 are similar in terms of statistical
significance to the analogous constrained version results presented in

Table 26. Likewise, the instrumental variable results in Table 8 are
similar to those presented in Table SB. These results suggest that even
using the simple linear specification, we can generally reject perfect
asset substitutability in the latter sample period.

The finding that the instrumented coefficients on the intervention
variable are generally statistically significant in equations 3 and 6 (for
the latter sample period) implies that intervention has an effect, even if
sterilized. The reason is that if mark and dollar assets' were perfect
substitutes, then the coefficient should be zero: changes in asset supplies
would have no effect on the risk premium.
30

Recall that, in theory, the coefficient of the product of the
intervention variable and the variance is the coefficient of relative riskaversion. Uben intervention is defined as percent of wealth the estimates
of the coefficient of risk aversion implicit in the Tables are extremely
large. This result is an artifact, not of the particular estimation
technique, but of the optimal-diversification theory, as has been noted
before: e.g., Krugman (1981). It follows from equation (4) that for
intervention to have a non-negligible effect on the risk premium, either
the coefficient of risk-aversion r must be much higher than 2, or the
proper denominator for x must be much smaller than the total stock supply
of marks and dollars.
31

Analogous unconstrained regression results using the one-week-ahead
expectations survey data are presented in Appendix Tables A7 and AS.

VI. A Summary of the Ouantitative Effects
For purposes of illustration, we now cry out some sample parameter
estimates in calculations of the effect of intervention on the exchange

rate. We assume in these experiments that interest rates in Germany and
the United States are held Constant (which, for some readers, might mean
that we are talking about sterilized intervention).

If interest rates

were allowed to vary, then the effects in a general portfolio-balance model
might be either smaller or larger than those reported here, depending on
whether the intervention were sterilized or not sterilized.
First, consider the effect of intervention on the exchange rate if it

is not known publically. tRecall that this experiment precludes any
effects that run via expectations of future asset supplies.J We begin with
the baseline case where expectations are assumed to be neither

extrapolative nor adaptive. If one wants to take the extrapolative and
adaptive parameters to be non-zero, the baseline case is still relevant as

a description of the long-run equilibrium (where 35-i and

are

zero). Under these assumptions, the intervention has no effect at all on
the risk premium.

It follows from equation (6) that the effect of the intervention on
the spot exchange rate is simply in proportion to the change in the supply

of mark assets. What is the proportion represented by, say, $100 million
dollars of intervention? If we are thinking of the case where only nonsterilized intervention matters, then the denominator is relatively clear:

total reserve nonay supplied to the banking system by the Bundesbank,
which, as of the end of 1987. was $ 126.3 billion [—

1.58151.

DM

199.7 billion /

Thus the effect is only .079 par cent. If we are thinking of

22

sterilized intervention, then the effect of $ 100 million will be even
smaller, because the denominator is the total supply of mark-denominated

bonds, rather than just money. (But it is worth recalling again that this
effect, even if small, is nonetheless not zero, according to our rejection
of perfect substitutability between mark and dollar bonds.)
To get large effects on the exchange rate, we need the public to hear

the news of the intervention. Our second experiment considers the effect
of such information in isolation, as reflected in the coefficient on our
NEWS variable, even if such intervention is in fact not taking place.
intervention actually takes place

is

[If

publically reported, then its

total effect would be the sum of the (small) effect reported in the
preceding paragraph, plus the (much larger) effect reported in this
paragraph, plus the effect implied by the coefficient on the KEPI variable

when significant.) Under our baseline case (no change in interest rates
and no extrapolative or adaptive expectationsi, the risk premium simply
changes by the coefficient of NEWS in the expectation equation: .007, to

take an INST estimate for one-month-ahead expectations in Table 4B. Such a
change in the risk premium will have a large effect on the demand for mark
versus dollar assets.

The effct of the change on the exchange rate is simply proportional

to the effect on x/lx, the ratio of the portfolio demand for marks to
the portfolio demand for dollars. Our preferred estimate of the
coefficient on

from equation (6), for Federal Reserve I-day

intervention, is 168,903 (this is from the third row of Table 6B: for the
period October 1984 to December 1987, using the one-month risk premium and

the simultaneous-equation estimate). The average value of v during this

23

period was .0000115. It follows that the average effect o the news was to
lower the portfolio demand for marks x by .0036 (—.007/(l68,903 x

.0000115)1, and to raise lx by the same amount. The average value of
during the period (measured as total debt issued by the German government,

divided by the total of German and U.S. debt) was .0994, and so the average
value of

was .9006. Thus the average effect of a news report was to

change x/l-z, the ratio of the portfolio demand for marks to the
portfolio demand for dollars, from .110 (—.0991.901) to .106 (—
This represents a 4 per cent decline in

.096/.904J.

and therefore in the

exchange rate.

At the

of

the sample period, the value of

was .121 (because the

value of the mark was much higher ($.6l3 as compared to $.437)), and so 1-

was .879. Thus the effect of a news report at that time would have been

to change x/lz, the ratio of the portfolio demand for marks to the
portfolio demand for dollars, from .138 (—.1211.879) to .133 (—.1171.883),
an effect of 3 per cent on the exchange rate.

These effects seem rather high (and they would be considerably higher if
the estimate was taken from the coefficient on Bundesbank intervention,

rather than that on Federal Reserve intervention). One's intuition that
the effect should in reality be smaller can easily be fit into any of

several categories. First, it is possible, even if we are talking about
intervention that is sterilized in the sense that there is no change in the
money supply, that the interest rates will absorb some of the impact of the
decreased demand for mark assets (the Cerman interest rate rising and the
U.S. Interest rate falling), so that the depreciation of the mark will be

smaller. One would need to specify a complete portfolio balance model to
24

answer how big the changes in the interest rates would be. But the effect
on the nominal interest differential would only have to be 35 basis points
to wipe out half of the reported effect on the spot rate.

Second, if one wishes to deviate from the baseline case to consider the
possibility of extrapolative expectations, then the effects reported above

obtain only in the long-run equilibrium in which s-a1 is zero. The
short-run impact effect could be smaller.32 For some readers an
intuitively appealing implication of extrapolative expectations is that,

after the first-week impact of the news, market forecasters react further
to the observed change in the exchange rate by jumping on the bandwagon, so

that the effect grows in subsequent weeks.33 Others may prefer to believe
that expectations are regressive rather than extrapolative; or that
newspaper reports or other random disturbances to the level of the spot
rate, to the extent that they are not confirmed subsequently by actual
observed changes in macroeconomic fundamentals, will gradually lose their
effect on the spot rate as time passes, and that this "unwinding factor" is

not adequately captured in our equations. This last possibility would

32

On the other hand, if market participants are believed to have
adaptive or regressive expectations, then the impact in short-run
equilibrium will be higher than in long-run equilibrium, the familiar
overshooting hypothesis. Estimates in Frankel and Froot (1988) show that
expectations are extrapolative at the short-term horizons, but turn
[We did not try these horizons
regressive at 6-month and 1-year horizons.
in our estimates here, partly because they are only available (from the
Financial Report) at six-week. intervals.j
C.Fred Bergsten. for example, has urged that Central Banks
intervene by "leaning into the wind," which could be interpreted as getting
a bandwagon or snow-balling effect going.

25

constitute a third factor that could reduce the effect on the spot rate in
long-run equilibrium below that reported above.34
Our own inclination is to believe that expectations only tend to be

extrapolative in occasional periods: "speculative bubble" environments,
when the foreign exchange market "loses its moorings" and forecasters

forget about fundamentals. Of course, these are precisely the periods in
which Central Bankers might be most interested in using the tool of
intervention.

35

The last circumstance in which the effect on the spot rate would be
less than that estimated here is if the event occurs during a period when

the variance is higher than it is on average. Again, these might be the
precisely periods in which Central Bankers would be most interested in
using intervention as a short-term tool, to smooth "disorderly markets."36

A related point concerns the famous "Lucas critique." If the
Central Bank adopted a policy of routinely making public announcements of
its intervention - - which is not its practice now - - each announcement
would not continue to have the same impact as in our estimates (unless,
perhaps, it was sufficiently backed up by a correspondingly greater degree
of actual changes in asset supplies). Our estimates only purport to say
what the effect was during the regime actually in effect during the sample
period.

References include Krugman (1985), Frankel (1985), Harris (1985),
Frankel and Froot (1988), and Williamson and Miller (1987).
36

On the other hand, the financial press often talks of central
bankers' intervention operations as seeking to have an effect on market
behavior precisely by creatinE extra volatility, and thereby "punishing"
nasty speculators. Our estimates imply that a change in volatility can
indeed have a significant impact on investors' asset demands. But, aside
from the difficulty of driving out nasty destabilizing speculators without
also driving out good stabilizing speculators, and aside from the general
undesirability of creating needless volatility, there is another problem
with this theory. If the supply of dollar assets in the market exceeds the
share in the minimum-variance portfolio, then an increase in the variance
will work to deDrecjae the dollar (for a given risk premium), which may
not be the direction desired by the authorities.

26

Our results cannot be viewed as definitive. We plan to extend the
framework in several directions, such as including other currencies.

Nevertheless, to sum up, the findings for the dollar/mark rate during our
mid-l980s sample period are generally favorable for the effectiveness of

intervention. There appear to be statistically significant effects

through

the expectations channel

through

the portfolio channel.

The

quantitative effects can vary, depending both on the particular estimates
chosen for the key parameters and on the precise experiment that one wishes

to consider. But we hope that the statistical significance of the effects
that we find will contribute to a re-evaluation of the conventional wisdom
as to the ineffectiveness of intervention.
