When Walmart Comes to Town: Always Low Housing Prices? Always?
Devin G. Pope and Jaren C. Pope
NBER Working Paper No. 18111
May 2012
JEL No. R20
ABSTRACT
Walmart often faces strong local opposition when trying to build a new store. Opponents often claim
that Walmart lowers nearby housing prices. In this study we use over one million housing transactions
located near 159 Walmarts that opened between 2000 and 2006 to test if the opening of a Walmart
does indeed lower housing prices. Using a difference-in-differences specification, our estimates suggest
that a new Walmart store actually increases housing prices by between 2 and 3 percent for houses
located within 0.5 miles of the store and by 1 to 2 percent for houses located between 0.5 and 1 mile.

Introduction
One of the most significant changes over the past two decades in the U.S. retail

market is the expansion of large box stores and supercenters. Walmart is the largest of
these rapidly growing retailers and is currently the biggest private employer in the world.
In the United States alone, Walmart currently operates more than 4,400 retail facilities
and employs almost 1.4 million people.1 Phone surveys suggest that 84% of households
in the U.S. shop at Walmart in a given year with 42% of households reporting to be
regular Walmart shoppers (Pew Research Center, 2005). These surveys also show that
lower-income households are more likely to shop at Walmart than upper-income
households. In fact, Basker, (2005b), Hausman and Leibtag (2007), and Basker and Noel
(2009) have shown that Walmart “Supercenters” that sell groceries offer many identical
food items as other grocers at an average price that is substantially lower than their
competitors. Hausman and Leibtag (2007) also find that these lower prices translate into a
significant increase in consumer surplus.
Despite the consumer benefits from the expansion of supercenters into new
geographic markets, there is often significant opposition and controversy when Walmart
tries to open a new store. One concern of opponents is the impact that a new Walmart
will have on local employment opportunities and wages. There is a small literature that
has analyzed this common concern including Basker (2005a), Hicks (2007a) and
Neumark et al. (2008). The findings of these studies have been mixed with Basker
(2005a) and Hicks (2007a) finding positive effects on employment and/or wages, while

Neumark et al. (2008) found negative effects.2 Another primary concern of opponents to
a new Walmart, is the effect it will have on crime, traffic and congestion, noise and light
pollution, the visual aesthetics of the local area, and ultimately the impact that these
externalities will have on local housing prices.3 However, unlike the academic literature
that surrounds the labor-market effects of Walmart, there has been no peer-reviewed
work that attempts to understand the impact of Walmart on housing prices.4
In this paper we try to understand if building a new Walmart has a positive or
negative effect on nearby housing prices. Answering this question is important as citizens
and local governments grapple with the economic impacts of allowing Walmart to build a
new store in their jurisdiction. Analyzing housing prices is a particularly useful way to
understand the economic value of a Walmart entering a community. For example, when a
Walmart is built, it generally is not built in isolation. The Walmart store often acts as a
hub that attracts a variety of other businesses, which in turn, can also have impacts on
housing markets. If households value convenient access to the goods and services that
Walmart and these other businesses provide, then the new stores would have a positive
impact on housing prices. However, if Walmart and the businesses that agglomerate
2

The different findings in these studies depend primarily on the identification strategy employed to account
for the potential endogeneity of the location and timing of Wal-Mart openings. See Basker (2007) and
Neumark et al. (2008) for a discussion of these differences.
3
An example of these concerns can be seen in a document created by the non-profit community
organization called “Responsible Growth for Northcross.” This group was formed to oppose a Walmart
supercenter being built near the Northcross mall in Austin, Texas. They made a top 10 list for why Walmart
shouldn’t be built in their town. Number two on their list was that “Wal-Marts Lower Prices. Including
your property value.” The full list can be found at
http://corpethics.org/downloads/northcross_no_walmart.pdf

There is a paper on the impact of Walmart on annual property tax collections and commercial properties
by Hicks (2007b) and a working paper by Vandegrift, Loyer, and Kababik (2011). There is also a small but
growing literature on the impact of Walmart on a variety of other outcomes outside of labor and housing
markets. These include poverty rates (Goetz and Swaminathan, 2006), small business activity (Sobel and
Dean, 2008), obesity (Courtemanche and Carden, 2011), social capital (Goetz and Rupasingha, 2006;
Carden et al., 2009a), leisure activities (Carden and Courtemanche, 2009) and traditional values (Carden et
al., 2009b).

nearby also impose negative externalities such as increased pollution, crime, and traffic,
then this could adversely impact prices of nearby houses. Thus the housing price effect a
priori is ambiguous. Accurately estimating the housing price changes that result from the
building and opening of a Walmart and the agglomeration it spurs may help local
policymakers to better understand if the net effect of a new Walmart is perceived as
beneficial to nearby households. This could in turn provide some economic justification
for a local government to encourage or discourage the building of a Walmart store in its
jurisdiction.
Our analysis of the impact that Walmart has on housing prices utilizes two unique
datasets. The first dataset describes when and where Walmarts opened between 2000 and
2006. The second dataset includes data for more than one million residential housing
transactions that occurred within four miles of 159 Walmarts that opened during this time
period. In contrast to the county-level analyses conducted by most previous work on the
impacts of Walmart, the micro-level nature of our dataset allows us to develop an
identification strategy that can help us to overcome the potential endogeneity of the
location and timing of Walmart openings. More specifically, we employ a difference-indifferences analysis that compares housing prices before and after a Walmart opens for
areas very close to a newly built Walmart, to areas slightly farther away.
The results from this analysis suggest that a new Walmart store increases nearby
housing prices. Our primary analysis suggests that houses located within 0.5 miles of the
store see increases in their prices of about 2-3 percent when comparing the two and a half
years before the Walmart opened to the two and a half years after the opening. Houses
between 0.5 and 1 mile from the Walmart see an increase of 1-2 percent. It does not

3

appear that these price impacts are caused by an abrupt increase in the number of houses
that sold in the area or by a change in the composition of houses that sold. Furthermore,
graphical evidence and falsification tests provide no evidence of a spurious, positive
effect due to differential housing price growth at the Walmart location and are therefore
supportive of a causal interpretation of our difference-in-differences estimates of the
impact of Walmart on housing prices.
The paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we discuss the potential impacts of
Walmart in terms of the value of accessibility and the costs of negative externalities. We
proceed in section 3 to describe the key datasets used in our analysis. In section 4, we
describe our empirical strategy for estimating the impact of Walmart on housing prices
and in section 5, we present the results. Finally, we conclude in section 6.

2.

Accessibility and Externality Effects of Walmart
Walmart likely affects housing prices through two main channels—accessibility

and negative externalities. Many studies at the intersection of economics and geography
have shown that land and housing prices vary with accessibility to “business districts”
that provide shopping and employment. For example, the American Housing Survey
(AHS), which is constructed by the U.S. Census Bureau and is based on household
surveys that are aimed at better understanding the determinants of housing values
throughout the United States, specifically asks households if there is “satisfactory
shopping within 1 mile.” Using this data, Emrath (2002) provided evidence that having
satisfactory shopping within one mile increased housing prices substantially inside metro
areas. Others, including Sirpal (1994) and Des Rosiers et al. (1995), have also found a

4

positive correlation between shopping centers and housing prices. These studies suggest
that having convenient access to a Walmart might increase housing prices.
On the other hand, the introduction of a Walmart store in a community also has
the potential to lower housing prices through increased local crime, noise and light
pollution, traffic congestion, garbage accumulation, and loss of perceived visual
aesthetics.

Several studies have shown that these disamenities are capitalized into

housing prices. For example, Linden and Rockoff (2008) and Pope (2008) have both
recently shown that a discrete change in the risk of a localized crime can have a causal
impact on housing prices, Smith et al. (2002) showed that freeway noise can have a
negative impact on housing prices, and Lim and Missios (1995) showed the negative
impact of landfills on housing prices.
An important question that has not been addressed in the literature is whether or
not the benefits of access to a Walmart outweigh the costs imposed by any negative
externalities that it imposes on the local community when it builds a store. Analyzing
housing prices before and after a Walmart is built in a given locale offers the potential to
test whether or not the benefits of accessibility outweigh the costs of negative
externalities. If one were to see a decrease in housing prices near a Walmart store after it
was built, this might signal that there are significant negative externalities imposed on
landowners and households nearby Walmart. However, if one were to see an increase in
housing prices, this might suggest that the benefits of easy access to Walmart’s lower
prices or the other shopping that naturally agglomerates near a Walmart outweigh any
negative externalities imposed on local residents.

5

There is some evidence that the value of accessibility declines less rapidly across
space than the costs of localized externalities. Li and Brown (1980) provide empirical
evidence to suggest that although proximity to industry and commercial areas impose
negative externalities on nearby houses, this same proximity creates substantial benefits
to households far enough away to avoid the sphere of influence from the negative
externalities. In the next sections we examine the impact of building Walmart stores on
surrounding housing prices to test whether the benefits of accessibility to Walmart
outweigh the costs of negative externalities that Walmart may impose.

3.

Data
The analysis relies on two key datasets. The first is data on Walmart stores that

opened over the relevant time frame of our study. The second is data on single family
residential properties in areas where the Walmart stores opened. In this section we
describe each source of data in preparation for our empirical analysis.

3.1 Walmart Data
The Walmart data includes the address and opening dates of regular Walmart
stores and Walmart supercenters in the United States.5 The original data contain the full
universe of Walmart stores that were built between 1962 and Jan. 31, 2006. However,
because of housing data constraints, we focus on 159 stores that were built between July
2000 and January 31, 2006 for which we have corresponding housing data. Table 1

5

The data was generously provided to us by Thomas J. Holmes of the University of Minnesota and was
used in his paper, Holmes (2011). The data and additional information on how the data were collected can
be found at Professor Holmes’ website at: http://www.econ.umn.edu/~holmes/research.html

6

provides summary statistics for this dataset over time and space. Panel A shows the years
in which the 159 Walmarts in our primary sample were built. It may seem curious that
there were 9 stores built in 2006 when our dataset ends January 31, 2006. However, Panel
B of Table 1 shows that January is the most common month for Walmarts to open. This is
because January 31st is considered the end of Walmart's fiscal year and so it appears there
is a push to open new Walmarts before this date. Panel C shows the twenty U.S. states in
our primary sample in which Walmarts were built.
We also collected some additional information on when it was announced that
these Walmarts were to be built. This information was collected using the internet to find
newspaper articles or other online sources that indicated the timing of when the building
of a particular Walmart was announced to the community. After collecting these dates,
we found that the median number of days from when the Walmart store was announced
until its construction was completed and the Walmart store was open for business was
516 days. This information is useful in our analysis to help determine the appropriate size
of the temporal window in which to analyze the housing price effects from a Walmart
opening. The announcement information is also useful for explicitly estimating if there
are price effects from the announcement itself.

3.2 Housing Price Data
Our analysis is based on a large housing dataset of more than one million
observations on the sales of single-family residential properties across the United States
between January 1, 1998 and January 31, 2008. We purchased the data from a
commercial vendor who had assembled them from assessor’s offices in individual towns

7

and counties.6 The data include the transaction price of each house, the sale date, and a
consistent set of structural characteristics, including square feet of living area, number of
bathrooms, number of bedrooms, year built, and lot size. Using these characteristics, we
performed some standard cleaning of the data, removing outlying observations, removing
houses built prior to 1900, and removing houses built on lots larger than 5 acres.
The data also include the physical address of each house, which we translated into
latitude and longitude coordinates using GIS street maps and a geocoding routine. The
lat-long coordinates were then used to determine the distance of each house to the nearest
Walmart location. In our primary analysis we restrict the data to include only those
houses that are within four miles of a Walmart and that sold in the two and a half years
before the nearest Walmart opened or in the two and a half years after it opened.7 Table 2
provides summary statistics of our primary housing dataset. The first column reports the
summary statistics for the over 600,000 housing transactions between 1998 and 2008 that
will be used in our primary analysis. The average sale price, square footage, # of baths,
age, lot size, and number of bedrooms in our full sample of homes was approximately
267,000 dollars, 1,767 square feet, 2 baths, 30 years old, 0.25 acres and 3 bedrooms
respectively. Also, about 15% of houses in our sample of transactions were newly
constructed, approximately 2% are located within 0.5 miles of where a Walmart has or
will be built, 7% are located between 0.5 and 1 mile, and 25% between 1 and 2 miles.8
The columns labeled “1 to 2 miles”, “0.5 to 1 mile” and “within 0.5 mile” provide
summary statistics for houses within these distances to where a Walmart has or will be
built. The summary statistics indicate that, houses closer to a Walmart tend to be smaller
in size, somewhat newer, and on slightly smaller lots. These small differences in housing

The commercial data vendor is Dataquick whose housing data is often used for academic research.
A four mile radius was chosen a priori following Holmes (2011) assumption that houses within 2 miles
are considered within the Walmart’s “neighborhood.” Houses between two and four miles were included in
our sample to act as a natural control group.

A house was defined as new construction if the year it sold was the same year it was reportedly built or
the year after it was built.

characteristics suggest that new Walmarts were not built in random locations. The
endogenous placement of Walmarts motivates the empirical strategy that we outline
below.

4. Empirical Strategy
4.1 Hedonic Pricing Method
When a household chooses to purchase a house, it is choosing more than just
housing characteristics; it is also choosing a bundle of locational characteristics such as
school quality, levels of criminal activity, proximity to work, and access to shopping. The
hedonic model was developed by Rosen (1974) to provide a theoretical foundation for the
relationship between prices and attributes. For over 40 years economists have used the
hedonic pricing method in conjunction with the housing market to reveal household
preferences for important locational characteristics.9
Early work in this area typically used cross-sectional data to try and identify the
implicit price of the locational attribute of focus. The primary concern with this literature
has been the possibility that omitted variables lead to a bias in the estimates for key
implicit prices. For example, if Walmarts tend to be built in areas where there is higher
crime, then a cross-sectional estimate of the implicit price for living near a Walmart that
excludes the relevant measures of crime will be biased downwards (more negative).
Recognizing the importance of mitigating this type of omitted variable bias, a new wave
of hedonic analyses have exploited quasi-experiments in time and/or space to better
overcome omitted variable bias and identify implicit prices of interest. Examples of this
9

Ridker and Henning’s (1967) study on the value of air quality is one of the earliest examples in this
literature. See Palmquist (2005) for a more complete review of the hedonic method applied to housing
markets.

9

new wave of quasi-experimental hedonic research include Black (1999), Figlio and Lucas
(2004), Chay and Greenstone (2005), Pope (2008) and Linden and Rockoff (2008),
among others.10
A quasi-experiment that exploits a temporal shock to better “difference” away
time-invariant omitted variables is not without some costs as was recently pointed out in
a paper by Kuminoff and Pope (2012). A large exogenous shock to the spatial
distribution of a nonmarket good(s) may also cause the hedonic price function to adjust in
order to clear the market. If this occurs, comparing implicit prices of the nonmarket good
before and after the shock (the capitalization effect) may not correspond to the change in
the willingness to pay for the nonmarket good (the welfare effect). Thus the quasiexperimental capitalization effects we estimate in section 5 may not have an exact
welfare theoretic interpretation (though the estimates may be suggestive of the sign and
magnitude). While the estimates may not be directly useful for a strict welfare-theoretic,
benefit-cost analysis of the impact of the placement of a Walmart in a community, they
can still be useful to homeowners, renters, assessors, appraisers, and the beneficiaries of
programs funded by property tax revenue in areas where Walmarts are built, since they
describe the size and sign of the capitalization effect on housing prices.
The work presented in this study builds off of this quasi-experimental literature in
the construction of an identification strategy to understand the impact of Walmart
openings on housing prices. However, we begin by constructing a traditional hedonic
specification for the analysis. The most basic hedonic price specification that we employ
takes the following cross-sectional form:
10

See Parmeter and Pope (2012) for a more detailed review of the quasi-experimental method applied to
housing and hedonic models.

10

(1)

log( Pijym ) = α jym + γX i + β 0 Dij

0. 5

1

2

+ θ 0 Dij + φ 0 Dij + ε ijym

The log of the sale price of the house is a function of a store (j) by year (y) by month (m)
specific effect ( α jym ), observable individual (i) property characteristics ( X i ), indicator
variables of individual houses within 0.5, 0.5 to 1, and 1 to 2 miles of a Walmart where
the omitted indicator variable is an indicator for homes between 2 and 4 miles from the
0.5
1
2
nearest Walmart ( Dij ; Dij ; Dij ) and a random error term that allows for year by month

by store area specific correlation in housing prices ( ε ijym ). Absent any omitted variable
bias and using only houses that sold after the nearest Walmart was built, estimation of
Equation 1 will yield estimates of the key parameters ( βˆ 0 ;θˆ0 ; φˆ0 ) that show the impact
that being near a Walmart has on housing prices for homes within 0.5, 0.5 to 1, and 1 to 2
miles of a Walmart relative to homes that are 2 to 4 miles from the store.11 This
estimation strategy can be considered the “traditional” cross-sectional hedonic approach.
A traditional approach to analyzing the impact that Walmart has on housing prices
may of course be plagued with omitted variable bias. Another hedonic specification that
could be used to help overcome the omitted variable bias would be a spatial differencein-differences specification of the following form:
(2)
log( Pijym ) = α jym + γX i + β 0 Dij

1

2

+ θ 0 Dij + φ 0 Dij + ( β 1 Dij

0.5

2

+ θ 1 Dij + φ1 Dij ) * Post iym + ε ijym

The key difference between Equation (2) and Equation (1) is that we are exploiting the
timing of the opening of the Walmart. To estimate Equation (2), housing data near a
11

This is of course assuming that the correct functional form is being used as well as other underlying
assumptions for linear regression hold.

11

Walmart both before and after the opening of the Walmart store would be used. The key
parameters in this specification are the estimates for the spatial indicators (

βˆ1 ;θˆ1 ; φˆ1

) that

have been interacted with an indicator for whether the housing transaction took place
after the Walmart was opened (

Post iym

). These parameters give us the local effect on the

treated spatial zones.12
The key advantage of the difference-in-differences specification is that by
including spatial fixed effects and looking at housing prices before and after the opening
of Walmarts, we can difference away time-invariant omitted variables that could bias our
estimates. However, we must rely on the identifying assumption that housing price trends
for areas near the Walmart and those areas slightly farther away from the Walmart would
have been the same had the Walmart store (and any other stores from the agglomeration
effect) not been built. This assumption would be less attractive if we were using countylevel averages of housing prices to make comparisons between “treated” counties and
“control” counties. As discussed earlier, much of the literature on the labor market effects
relied on county-level measures for their analyses. This is why, for example, Basker
(2005a) and Neumark (2008) relied on instrumental variable strategies to deal with the
endogeneity of Walmart location decisions. In our analysis, instead of needing housing
price trends in treatment and control counties to be the same before and after Walmart is
built, all we need is housing price trends to be the same in the four mile zone surrounding
the Walmart. Given that the area of a circle with a radius of 4 miles is approximately
1/12th of the area of the median county in the U.S., exploiting the miro-level housing data
12

The estimates generated from this specification are clearly for the houses near the Walmarts in our
sample and may not be externally valid, for example, in very rural areas for which we do not have housing
transactions.

12

in this way is very attractive.13 Furthermore, the micro-level housing data allows us to
explore any change in the rate at which houses sold or a change in the composition of
houses that sold after Walmart was announced or built that could affect the interpretation
of our estimates. Furthermore, the micro-level housing data allows us to look at housing
price trends graphically and also to conduct falsification tests by shifting the Walmart
open dates forward. We explore the housing composition issue and do both of the checks
on the validity of our key identifying assumption in the difference-in-differences
framework in the results section.

5.

Results

5.1 Cross-Sectional Results
We first describe the results from estimating a “traditional” cross-sectional
hedonic analysis following Equation (1) above. The housing data used in this regression
are restricted to approximately 358,000 houses within four miles of a Walmart that sold
in the two and a half years after the Walmart was built. The regression includes store-byyear-by-month fixed effects and the structural characteristics that were described in Table
2. The store-by-year-by-month fixed effects provide the regression with flexible control
over time and space. This is important since we have pooled housing observations across
the country to conduct our analysis and the fixed effects force identification to come from
spatial differences within a four mile area surrounding a Walmart. The regression
includes three spatial indicator variables that indicate if a house is less than 0.5 miles, 0.5

13

To calculate that a circle with a radius of 4 miles is 1/12th the size of the median county, note that the
median county size is approximately 622 square miles and the area of a 4 mile circle is approximately 50
square miles.

13

to 1 mile, or 1 to 2 miles from the nearest Walmart. In the traditional hedonic framework,
the coefficients on these indicators provide information about the marginal willingness to
pay to live near a Walmart store.
Column (1) in Table 3 provides the coefficients and their standard errors for the
three spatial indicator variables. The standard errors have been clustered at the Walmart
store level. Taken literally, the coefficient on the within 0.5 mile indicator suggests that
Walmarts in our sample reduce the prices of homes within 0.5 miles by approximately
2.5% (statistically significant at the 5% level) and homes between 0.5 and 1 mile by a
little less than 2% (statistically significant at the 10% level). Of course the concern with
interpreting these estimates as the causal impact of Walmart on nearby housing prices is
that they are likely to suffer from omitted variable bias. For example, if Walmart tends to
open stores in areas that are less expensive for unobserved reasons (i.e. lower quality
schools, the local landfill is nearby, further away from downtown, etc.) then these
unobservable disamenities could potentially bias the traditional hedonic coefficients
downwards.

5.2 Difference-in-Differences Results
To help mitigate the concern of omitted variable bias in our analysis we
implement difference-in-differences regressions following Equation (2). The housing
data used in this regression are restricted to houses within four miles of a Walmart that
sold in the two and a half years after (just like in the cross-sectional analysis), but now we
also include houses that sold in the two and a half years before the Walmart was built.
The regression again includes store-by-year-by-month fixed effects and structural

14

characteristics of the house that were described in Table 2. Besides the three spatial
indicator variables that were included in the cross-sectional analysis, interactions of these
indicators with an indicator for the house having sold after the Walmart opened are also
included. The coefficients on these interaction indicators are of primary interest in the
difference-in-differences analysis.
Column (2) in Table 3 provides the coefficients and their standard errors for the
three spatial indicator variables and their interactions with the post-opening indicator
variable. The standard errors have again been clustered at the Walmart store level. The
coefficient on the “within 0.5 miles” indicator suggests that homes within a half mile of
the future Walmart location sold for approximately 5% less than homes two to four miles
away. However, the coefficient on “within 0.5 miles*post” suggests that homes within
0.5 miles of the constructed Walmart store actually sold for approximately 2.5% more
than baseline, after the Walmart was built. In other words, while homes within 0.5 miles
of the future Walmart location sold for 5% less than homes 2 to 4 miles away, they only
sold for 2.5% less after the Walmart was built. Similarly homes between 0.5 and 1 mile
of the future Walmart sold for approximately 3% less before the Walmart, but
experienced an increase in sales prices of approximately one percentage point after the
Walmart was built. Homes between 1 and 2 miles experience a small, but statistically
insignificant increase in housing prices after the Walmart opening relative to the 2 to 4
mile control band.
Column (3) of Table 3 performs a heterogeneity check on our key findings in
Column (2) by focusing the analysis on the 88 Walmart “supercenters” in our sample.14.

14

A Walmart supercenter is typically larger than a regular Walmart store and also sells grocery items.

15

The magnitude of the coefficient on the indicator “within 0.5 miles*post” is
approximately the same in column (2). The biggest difference is that the coefficient on
“0.5 to 1 mile*post” is twice as large as before suggesting that Walmart supercenters
increase housing prices by approximately 2% for homes between one half and one mile
after a Walmart supercenter opens.
Our Analysis thus far has been using a window of two and a half years before
and after a Walmart opens for the inclusion of housing data in the regressions. In an ideal
quasi-experiment for Walmart openings, the building of a Walmart would be announced
one day and then the next day it would be built and operating. With this sharp
discontinuity in time, one could potentially narrow the temporal window to something
less than two and a half years before and after the opening of the nearest Walmart.
However, the Walmarts in our sample took approximately one and a half years on
average to be built after they were publicly announced. Therefore if there is some change
in housing prices due to the announcement rather than the opening, narrowing the
temporal window would cause the estimates to be attenuated. On the other hand, if we
allow the temporal window to be very large, then we would be forced to drop many
Walmarts from our sample since we analyze only Walmarts that have enough housing
data around the opening date to create a symmetric temporal window. Since we only have
housing data from 1998 to 2008 available to us, requiring five years of pre-opening
housing data and five years of post-opening housing data would only allow us to use
Walmart’s that were built in 2003. Thus two and a half years was chosen to balance the
tradeoff between excluding too many Walmarts and including enough housing sales that

16

occurred before the announcement of the Walmart in an effort to mitigate the attenuation
that may occur from the announcement effect.
Although from an experimental perspective it is nice to keep the temporal window
for the inclusion of housing data symmetric around the Walmart opening date, one could
potentially relax this to include Walmart stores in the analysis that have at least two and a
half years of housing data before and after the opening, but then include housing
observations that were temporally more distant than two and a half years before or after
the opening. Column (4) shows the results of this difference-in-differences specification
that does not exclude housing observations that are temporally more distant than two and
a half years before or after the nearest Walmart’s opening. The key coefficients are
slightly larger with the within 0.5 mile*post coefficient suggesting an approximate 3.3
percent increase in housing prices and the 0.5 to 1 mile*post coefficient suggesting an
approximate 2.3 percent increase.
One could also potentially widen or narrow the temporal window to check for
robustness. Column (5) in Table 3 redoes the difference-in-differences analysis but
widens the temporal window to include three years of housing data pre and post Walmart
opening, while Column (6) narrows the temporal window to include only two years of
housing data pre and post. The main findings are robust to these changes in the temporal
window. The size of the coefficient on the “within 0.5 mile*post” indicator is slightly
larger than in column (2) when the window is expanded to three years before and after,
and slightly smaller when contracted to two years before and after. This is consistent with
our earlier conjecture that if there is some change in housing prices due to the

17

announcement or construction of the Walmart prior to the opening, narrowing the
temporal window would cause the estimates to be attenuated downwards.
We can also more formally analyze whether or not there is an announcement
effect on housing prices by applying our difference-in-differences analysis to the
announcement date rather than the opening date. This time we include the housing data
covering the two and a half years before and after the Walmart is announced. Column (7)
of Table 3 shows the results of this analysis. The coefficient on “within 0.5 miles” shows
once again that homes within a half mile of the future Walmart location sold for
approximately 5% less than homes two to four miles away. The interaction of the postWalmart opening indicator for this distance suggests a 1.6% increase in housing prices
although it is not statistically significant using conventional measures. The “0.5 to 1
mile*post” coefficient suggests an approximate 1.4% increase in housing prices in the
year after the announcement in this spatial zone and this result is statistically significant
at the 5 percent level. These results are suggestive of there being some impact even from
the announcement of the Walmart.

5.3 Housing Composition Effects
One issue with how we interpret the results we have found, has to do with
whether or not the types of houses that are selling after a Walmart is built (or announced)
are substantially different than the types of houses that were being sold previously. If
there is a large compositional difference in the types of houses that transacted before and
after, then this may signal that the housing price effects we observe are being at least
partially driven by supply rather than demand. To be clear, this is still an impact of the

18

Walmart being built (or announced), but it suggests that the estimates are not as tightly
linked to household preferences and their perceptions about local externalities and the
benefits of accessibility to shopping.
To explore the composition effects in this application, we ran a series of linear
regressions with our key housing attributes on the left hand side and the distance to
Walmart zone indicators and interactions on the right hand side. In these regressions we
continued to control for store-by-year-by-month fixed effects and clustered the standard
errors at the Walmart store level. Once again, the coefficients on the Walmart zone
indicators interacted with the “post” time period are of primary interest as they will signal
if there were substantial changes in these housing characteristics after the Walmart was
built (or announced). Table 4 provides the results from these regressions. Panel A shows
the results where we analyze changes in structural characteristics before and after
Walmart opened, and Panel B shows the results where we analyze changes in structural
characteristics before and after Walmart was announced. Of the 18 interaction
coefficients that are estimated in Panel A, only one is statistically significant (at the 10%
level) suggesting there was no substantial housing composition change before and after
Walmart opened.

Of the 18 interaction coefficients estimated in Panel B, 3 are

statistically significant at the 10% level but only 1 of those is significant at the 5% level.
This lone coefficient suggests that there was an approximate 5% decrease in new houses
that were sold after the Walmart was announced in the 0 to 0.5 mile zone. Overall, these
regressions do not seem consistent with strong housing composition effects before and
after either a Walmart’s opening or announcement.

19

Another signal of potential instability in the marketplace caused by either the
opening or announcement of a Walmart would be if there was an abrupt change in the
number of homes that were being sold after the opening or announcement. To explore
this hypothesis we analyzed the number of houses that transacted each quarter for the 10
quarters leading up to and the 10 quarters after the Walmarts in our sample opened.
Figure 1 shows this graphically for each of the 4 spatial zones in our analysis relative to
the opening date and the “approximate” announcement date.15 The natural log of the
number of housing transactions by quarter is used so that each of the zones can be easily
compared.16 As can be seen in Figure 1, the log number of houses in each area is
gradually increasing over the time period and there do not appear to be any dramatic
percentage changes or divergences between the 4 zones, suggesting that the housing
markets were relatively stable over this time period.

5.4 Graphical Analysis and Falsification Tests
A key assumption in our difference-in-differences identification strategy is that
within a localized four mile zone, Walmarts were not built in areas where there was a
preexisting trend in housing prices. If for example, houses located within 1 mile of where
a Walmart opened were experiencing faster growth in housing prices relative to homes in
the 1 to 4 mile band, this could lead to estimating a spurious positive effect of Walmart
openings in our difference-in-differences analysis. One way to better examine if there are
15

The approximate announcement date is based on the median number of days between announcement and
opening for the Walmart’s in our sample.
16
The 2-4 mile zone is substantially larger in area than the 0-0.5 mile zone so it mechanically has many
more housing transactions such that taking the natural log makes for an easier comparison. We also created
a plot that shows the residuals from regressing the ln(number of house sales in a quarter) on quarter of the
year from Walmart opening and by distance from the new Walmart which also reveals no significant
change in house sales due to a Walmart opening.

20

preexisting trends in the housing prices near where Walmart stores are built is to
graphically illustrate housing price trends in the spatial zones before and after Walmart
opens.
To provide this graphical evidence we first run a regression following Equation
(2) using the data in our primary specification (Table 3, column (2)), but we leave out the
spatial indicators and their interactions. We then aggregate the residuals by quarter of the
year, for two and a half years before and after the Walmart opened, for each spatial zone
(within 0.5 miles, 0.5 to 1 mile, 1 mile to 2 miles and 2 miles to 4 miles from the
Walmart), relative to the opening date of the nearest Walmart. Figure 2 plots the residuals
from this regression. The y-axis ranges from -0.06 and 0.02 which represents an
approximate 8 percentage point difference in housing prices. The x-axis ranges from -10
to 10 which represents the ten quarters before the Walmart opened and the ten quarters
after the Walmart opened. The vertical line in the center of the graph shows the timing of
the opening date for the Walmarts in our sample. The vertical line at -5.67 illustrates the
approximate announcement date that is based on the statistic reported earlier that the
median time between announcement and the opening of a Walmart in our sample is 516
days.
The top two lines in Figure 2 show that the residuals for houses between one and
four miles from the Walmart are generally close to zero and unchanging over the fiveyear period. The third line down represents the residuals of houses between a half and
one mile from the nearest Walmart and it can be seen that they trend about -0.02 log price
points lower until about one year before the nearest Walmart opens, and then they
experience a slow rise. The fourth line down, representing the residuals of houses within

21

0.5 miles of the Walmart, shows the most dramatic change from before and after the
Walmart opens. The residuals start out around -0.04 until about one year before the
Walmart opens and then there appears to be a dramatic increase in the residuals until they
are near zero, two and a half years after the Walmart opens. Overall the residuals for the
four zones are “fanned out” before the Walmart opens, are relatively steady until a year
before the Walmart opens, and then they compress until they are nearly identical two and
a half years after the Walmart opens. Given that it is likely to be apparent to homebuyers
that a Walmart is being built two or three quarters before it is complete, this graphical
evidence bolsters the argument that our difference-in-differences estimates are causal.
Figure 3 provides similar graphical evidence for the change in the residuals in the
four spatial zones, before and after the Walmart was announced to be built. Again,
before the announcement date there does not appear to be much of a trend in the residuals
for any of the four zones. However, after the announcement of the new Walmart is made
the residuals for the homes between 0.5 and 1 mile appear to begin trending upward and
the homes within 0.5 miles trend upward even more rapidly.
Another check for whether or not the increase in housing prices after the opening
of a Walmart is due to differential trends in housing prices between homes nearest the
Walmart relative to housing prices farther away is to conduct a falsification test. We do
this by estimating Equation (2) using our 2.5 year pre and post window but including
false Walmart opening dates. The false opening dates are set to two years, two and a half
years, and three years prior to the actual opening dates of Walmart. The results presented
in Table 4 provide no evidence of a spurious, positive effect due to differential housing
price growth at the Walmart location. Thus this falsification test in combination with the

22

graphical analysis is supportive of a causal interpretation of our difference-in-differences
estimates of the impact of Walmart on housing prices.

6.

Conclusion
Although recent academic work has made it clear that the opening of a Walmart

lowers retail prices for consumers in the area, there has been little work that
systematically tests whether or not the opening of a Walmart lowers housing prices. In
this paper we have attempted to answer this question. We compiled a unique dataset that
linked micro-level housing data to 159 Walmarts that opened in the United States
between 2000 and 2006. Exploiting the spatial resolution of the data we compared areas
very near the Walmarts to areas slightly further away before and after the Walmarts
opened. The results from our primary difference-in-differences specification suggest that
a new Walmart store actually increases housing prices by between 2 and 3 percent for
houses located within a half mile of the store and by 1 to 2 percent for houses located
between a half and one mile from the store. For the average priced home in these areas
this translates into an approximate $7,000 increase in housing price for homes within a
half mile of a newly opened Walmart and a $4,000 increase for homes between a half and
one mile.
Overall, the estimated capitalization effects that we find suggest a revealed
preference by many households to live near a Walmart and the stores that naturally
agglomerate nearby. On average, the benefits to quick and easy access to the lower retail
prices offered by Walmart and shopping at these other stores appear to matter more to
households than any increase in crime, traffic and congestion, noise and light pollution,

23

or other negative externalities that would be capitalized into housing prices. This result is
useful to policymakers that consider passing zoning regulations and other laws that could
affect Walmart’s ability to build new stores within their jurisdiction.
Although we in general find the results to be reasonably credible, some caveats
should also be made. It is possible that while the accessibility benefits appear to extend
out to at least a mile, there may still be negative externalities that affect households that
live very close to a Walmart. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence that Walmarts
increase housing values on average, but it is possible that in certain cases a new store
may actually decrease housing values due to externalities. Finally, our estimates may be
internally valid, but they may not be accurate in more rural areas, for example, where we
do not have housing data. Examining the housing price impacts of Walmart in these
other settings may be important to policymakers and could be looked at in future
research.

Note: These linear regressions put the housing characteristics on the left hand size and the distance to the
Walmart zones and interactions on the RHS while continuing to control for store-by-year-by-month fixed
effects. Standard errors are clustered at the Walmart store level and a * means the estimate is significant at
the 10% level, ** at the 5% level and *** at the 1% level.
