    "abstract": "\n\nDetailed country-by-country chronologies are an informative companion piece to our paper \u201cExchange Arrangements Entering the 21st Century: Which Anchor Will Hold?,\u201d which provides a comprehensive history of anchor or reference currencies, exchange rate arrangements, and a new measure of foreign exchange restrictions for 194 countries and territories over 1946-2016. The individual country chronologies are also a central component of our approach to classifying regimes.  These country histories date dual or multiple exchange rate episodes, as well as to differentiate between pre-announced pegs, crawling pegs, and bands from their de facto counterparts.  We think it is important to distinguish between say, de facto pegs or bands from announced pegs or bands, because their properties are potentially different. The chronologies also flag the dates for important turning points, such as when the exchange rate first floated, or when the anchor currency was changed.  We extend our chronologies as far back as possible, even though  we only classify regimes from 1946 onwards.\n\n",
