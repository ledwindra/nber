Inaccurate age and sex data in the Census PUMS files: ¸˛Evidence and Implications

ABSTRACT
We discover and document errors in public use microdata samples ("PUMS files") of the 2000 Census,
the 2003-2006 American Community Survey, and the 2004-2009 Current Population Survey. For women
and men ages 65 and older, age- and sex-specific population estimates generated from the PUMS files
differ by as much as 15% from counts in published data tables. Moreover, an analysis of labor force
participation and marriage rates suggests the PUMS samples are not representative of the population
at individual ages for those ages 65 and over. PUMS files substantially underestimate labor force participation
of those near retirement ages and overestimate labor force participation rates of those at older ages.
These problems were an unintentional by-product of the misapplication of a newer generation of disclosure
avoidance procedures carried out on the data. The resulting errors in the public use data could significantly
impact studies of people ages 65 and older, particularly analyses of variables that are expected to change
by age.

This article investigates serious problems with the age and sex data provided by the
Census Bureau in many recent public data products. Census Bureau data resources include
published tables based on the full data that the agency collects, and public use microdata samples
("PUMS files") based on an anonymized subsample of the data that has been subjected to
disclosure avoidance techniques. For women and men ages 65 and older, age- and sex-specific
population estimates generated from many recent PUMS files differ substantially from counts
presented in published data tables that were created using the full, confidential data. For
example, population estimates from the 2000 decennial Census PUMS files differ from the
published data tables by up to 15% for some age and sex combinations. These differences are not
related to regular sampling variation. Instead, the problems were an unintentional by-product of
the misapplication of disclosure avoidance procedures carried out on the data. The resulting
errors in the public use data are severe, and, as such, we argue that the Census Bureau's PUMS
files from several years should not be used to study people ages 65 and older.
We discover and document the impact of these errors in PUMS files of the 2000 Census,
the 2003-2006 American Community Survey (ACS), and the 2004-2009 Current Population
Survey (CPS). We explore this issue with two main goals in mind. First, Census Bureau PUMS
files are extremely important datasets for researchers and policy-makers. The problematic data
have been used by thousands of researchers for a variety of purposes. We aim to raise awareness
of how the data errors could generate biases in current and future research results. Second, this
issue provides an important cautionary tale for producers and users of data that is subject to
disclosure avoidance techniques. The newest generation of disclosure avoidance techniques has
significant benefits for both data producers and data users. Older techniques simply removed
detail from datasets (for example, by aggregating small categories, top-coding extreme values,

2
etc.). Newer techniques, such as swapping or blanking, retain detail and provide better protection
of respondents' confidentiality. However, the effects of the new techniques are less transparent to
data users and mistakes can easily be overlooked. Therefore these new techniques carry
increased responsibility for both data users and data producers to vigilantly review the
anonymized data.
Our analysis begins with a review of available documentation on the issue, followed by a
data analysis illustrating the apparent error in PUMS files from the decennial census, the
American Community Survey, and the Current Population Survey. We then discuss the
continuing effect that these problems are likely to have on the study of aging and the elderly. We
conclude by suggesting methods for identifying problematic data, potential work-arounds, and
longer-term approaches to correcting the errors.

Disclosure Avoidance Techniques
Following communication with the authors of this paper, the Census Bureau
acknowledged in two user notes that disclosure avoidance techniques have caused seemingly
minor problems with age and sex data in Census and ACS PUMS files published between 2000
and 2007. The first user note was added in October 2008, in the errata notes that are appended to
the Census 2000 PUMS codebook. The codebook's "Data Note 12" warns researchers that
disclosure avoidance techniques resulted in "some abnormal ratios for the number of men to the
number of women (sex ratio) for people age 65 and over".1 The note presents sex ratios and
population counts by grouped years of age, comparing the 2000 1% PUMS file to published
estimates from Summary File 3. Released in April 2009, ACS PUMS User Note 47 presents
2006 ACS data and contains identical warnings regarding the 2000-2006 ACS samples and the
1

3
2005-2007 ACS 3-year sample.2 The Census 2000 user note indicates that "the PUMS files will
not be re-released using a modified technique as that would pose a disclosure risk."3
PUMS files have always been subject to a wide range of disclosure avoidance techniques.
Some of these techniques are transparent to data users and are discussed at length in dataset
documentation. The most common and well-known of these are: (1) the microdata released to the
public is only a sample of all the records the Census has; (2) the data file does not release lowlevel geographic identifiers; (3) variables with hundreds of categories have a smaller number of
categories on the public use file; and (4) continuous variables with outlying values, such as
income and transportation time, are top- and bottom coded.
Disclosure avoidance techniques have grown more complex in the past few years, due
largely to concerns that new data technologies present a growing disclosure threat. These newer
techniques include swapping or rank swapping (also called switching), replacing randomly
selected records with imputed values (as if the data were missing), and noise addition.4 It seems
possible that any of these techniques could be primarily responsible for the highly distorted age
data in the Census 2000 and ACS PUMS files.
The user notes do not provide information on the particular technique that caused the
problem, but the data itself can be used to better understand the effects that the errors could be
having on research.5 In the next section, we use public census data to describe the extent of the

On December 18, 2009, the Census Bureau released a revised version of the 2006 ACS data. Our analyses use the
original version of the 2006 ACS data. There is no indication that other revised ACS datasets will be released.

Details regarding disclosure avoidance techniques used by the Census Bureau are discussed in Zayatz (2005) and
in the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology Statistical Policy Working Paper #22
(http://www.fcsm.gov/working-papers/SPWP22_rev.pdf).

The Census Bureau has been unwilling to give further detail regarding the nature of the misapplication of the
disclosure avoidance techniques, since public knowledge of such detail may jeopardize the effectiveness of these
techniques.

problem by comparing the faulty age and sex distribution of the PUMS files to those from
published census tables.

Data Comparisons
The Census publishes tables that are almost always based on datasets that are much larger
than the PUMS files. In the 2000 Census, published tables are based on either the complete
population (in Summary Files 1 and 2) or about one sixth of the population (in Summary Files 3
and 4). The largest PUMS file in 2000 included fewer than a third of the cases that were used to
make Summary Files 3 and 4. Similarly, American Community Survey PUMS files include
about two-thirds of the cases in the larger datasets that are used to make the published tables
available on the Census Bureau's American FactFinder site (http://factfinder.census.gov). While
it is possible that the Census' internal files were also exposed to disclosure avoidance techniques,
these techniques may be done separately, to a lesser extent, or not at all.

2000 Decennial Census data
Documentation of the erroneous data focuses on problems with sex ratios in the PUMS
files. However, the full extent of the problem can be seen more clearly in single-year population
estimates by age and sex. In Figure 1, we show sex- and age-specific population estimates from
the 2000 5% Census PUMS as a proportion of published counts from Summary File 4. For all
ages 0-64, PUMS estimates are never more than 1.5% higher or lower than published counts. In
contrast, for those ages 65 and up, PUMS estimates differ from published population counts
substantially, in some cases by more than 10%. For instance, the PUMS estimate of the number
of 65-year-old women is 895,052, which is only about 83% of Summary File 4's published count
of 1,079,328.

5
American Community Survey data
There are no published single-year age estimates from the American Community Survey
(ACS), so it is not possible to view the problem at the same level of detail as in the 2000 Census.
The ACS publishes counts by age groups, and thus, we compare these published group counts
with population count estimates for comparable age groups calculated using population-weighted
PUMS data. Once again we see that the PUMS calculations diverge substantially from published
counts beginning at age 65. Figure 2 shows estimates from the 2006 ACS PUMS as a proportion
of the 2006 ACS published data obtained from American FactFinder.
The problem with the disclosure avoidance techniques were corrected before the release
of the 2007 ACS PUMS file. Both the 2007 and 2008 ACS PUMS files produce estimates of the
population at all ages that are close to those in the published tables. Examining the ACS PUMS
since the inception of the ACS reveals that the problem with the disclosure avoidance techniques
in the ACS PUMS files appeared for the first time in 2003. PUMS estimates of the population of
those ages 65 years and older differ substantially from published accounts in the 2003 through
the 2006 survey years. The Census Bureau's Data Note 47 suggests that the errors also exist in
the 2000-2002 ACS PUMS data; however our analysis suggests that the 2000-2002 files do not
contain errors
Figure 3 shows ACS PUMS estimates as a proportion of published data for all ACS
samples. To facilitate easy comparisons of the seven different samples, Figure 3 presents data for
women. The samples in Figure 3's left panel—the 2001, 2002, 2007, and 2008 ACS—all
produce good estimates of the female population at all ages. The samples on the right panel—the
2003-2006 ACS—reveal undercounts of women in their mid-60s and overcounts of women over
age 85 in all samples. Additionally, in 2003 and 2004, the ACS PUMS samples overcount

6
women in their early 70s and early 80s; in 2005 and 2006 ACS PUMS samples overcount
women in their late 60s. The 2003 and 2004 ACS samples produce the worst estimates,
particularly for 65 and 66-year-olds. In these samples, the PUMS estimates of 65-66 year-old
women are about 85% of the count in the published tables. A similar analysis of the data for
men reveals that estimates of the male population are also distorted in the 2003-2006 samples.

Current Population Survey data
While the Census has thus far only acknowledged a link between the misapplication of
disclosure avoidance techniques and data problems in the 2000 Census and the ACS public use
files, an investigation of the Current Population Survey (CPS) data suggests that the problems
affecting estimates of the older population may have affected these public use files as well.
There are no published population totals for the CPS, so it is not possible to conduct the
same type of analysis we did for the 2000 Census and the ACS.6 Instead of comparing CPS
estimates to an external standard, we investigate the problem in CPS using a measure that is
internal to the dataset: the sex ratio. In the Census and ACS public use files, the over- and
undercounts of men and women ages 65 and older do not occur proportionally by age and
gender; indeed at age 65 men tend to be overcounted while women tend to be undercounted.
These under and overcounts of men and women impact the sex ratio, resulting in implausibly
large shifts in the sex ratio across the ages for those ages 65 and up.
Panel 1 of Figure 4 shows the sex ratio of men to women among 62-to-64-year-olds not
living in group quarters, comparing three data sources: (1) the CPS Annual Social and Economic
6

ACS published tables are not directly compared to the CPS. The CPS excludes institutional group quarters, while
the 2000-2004 ACS excludes all group quarters (institutional and non-institutional), and the 2005-2008 ACS
includes all group quarters. There are also slight differences in how CPS and ACS identify non-institutional group
quarters (ACS counts many more non-institutional group quarters than the CPS). Because of these differences, ACS
published data never represent the same population that is sampled in the CPS. However, a comparison of
population estimates by age, still reveal unexpectedly large shifts in the ratio of CPS PUMS estimates to ACS
published estimates at age 65 beginning in 2004.

7
Supplement (CPS ASEC) PUMS; (2) the ACS PUMS; and (3) the ACS published data.7 These
data on 62-to-64-year-olds show the level of variation one would normally expect to see between
the three different data sources, absent any disclosure avoidance distortions. All three data
sources produce similar estimates—among 62-to-64-year-olds there are about 9 men for every 10
women. Not surprisingly, there is more variance in the estimates produced from the CPS, since
the CPS is a much smaller survey than the ACS. Still, 90% confidence intervals around the CPS
estimates easily contain estimates from the published ACS tables and ACS PUMS samples for
each year. In other words, there are never statistically significant differences between the three
sources' estimates of the 62-to-64 year-old population.8
In Panel 2 of Figure 4 we turn to those ages 65 and 66, ages shown to have substantial
errors stemming from the misapplication of disclosure avoidance techniques in the ACS PUMS
files from 2003 to 2006. As with the estimates for 62-to-64-year-olds, in 2001 and 2002, and
again in 2007 and 2008, the ratio of men to women among 65 and 66-year-olds in the PUMS
files tracks the ratios calculated from the published ACS data quite closely. Moreover, the ratios
follow a sensible pattern given death patterns by age, with a small decline in the sex ratio at ages
62-to-64 from .9 to around .87 at ages 65 and 66.
In contrast, the ratios calculated using the ACS PUMS data from 2003 to 2006 differ
substantially from the ratios calculated using the published tables for this period. Moreover,
these estimates differ from what one would expect given life expectancy patterns and the sex
ratios for those a few years younger, with the gender ratio increasing, rather than decreasing, as

Published data from the 2005-2009 ACS includes a small number group quarters cases; it was not possible to
remove them.

We generated 90% confidence intervals for the CPS sex ratios using the delta method; standard errors were
adjusted to take account of added weighting variance in light of the complex sample design of the CPS.

8
these cohorts age. Indeed, in 2003 and 2004, the ACS PUMS estimates suggest a reverse gender
ratio with more men than women for those ages 65 and 66.
Sex ratios from the CPS ASEC PUMS are also much higher than the published ACS data
from 2004 to 2009. To test whether sex ratios in CPS data and published ACS data could be due
to ordinary sampling error, we generated 90% confidence intervals for the CPS sex ratios. In
2000 through 2003, the published ACS sex ratios were contained well within the 90%
confidence interval of the sex ratio estimated using the CPS PUMS data. Beginning in 2004, the
90% confidence interval no longer contains, in most years, the published ACS sex ratio.
Moreover, it is unlikely that regular sampling variance would cause such large overestimates of
the sex ratio of 65 and 66-year-olds calculated from the CPS data for six consecutive years.
While there is no ACS data to compare the CPS with in 2009, the 2009 CPS ASEC PUMS
estimate of the sex ratio is the highest estimate seen across all years.
Taken together, the estimates in Figure 4 suggest that the CPS ASEC PUMS samples
may have been created using the Census Bureau's faulty disclosure avoidance techniques
beginning with the 2004 PUMS, continuing through the most recent available ASEC PUMS in
2009.
Thus far we have shown that the PUMS samples produce inaccurate population estimates
and sex ratios for those ages 65 and up. The larger issue with these erroneous data is not simply
that sex ratios could be inaccurate, but rather that the sex and age data attached to each case is
probably often wrong, which creates the potential for the errors to spill over into analyses of any
related variable. When the PUMS vastly under-estimates the number of 65-year old women, for
instance, we have to wonder whether these "missing" women are included elsewhere in the
PUMS file. Given the unexplained surplus of women in higher age ranges, the altered cases were

9
likely allocated to other, older ages. For instance, the lack of women in their mid-60s in Figure 1
seems to be offset by spikes of women in their early 70s and 80s. Alternatively, some of the
missing 65 year-old women could have been "switched" to be 65-year-old men, since Figure 1
also shows a surplus of men at age 65.
These "reassigned" age and sex data could lead researchers to draw incorrect inferences
about any variable related to age or sex. For example, Figure 5 shows PUMS estimates of labor
force participation in 2000 as a proportion of published rates from the Census' internal files.
PUMS files underestimate labor force participation of men and women age 65 and substantially
overestimates labor force participation of women in their 70s and older and of men over age 75.
The likely explanation for this unusual trend is that people have been reassigned ages. For
example, women that the PUMS identifies as 70-to-74-year-olds may be women in their 60s or
men in their 70s; both groups with higher labor force participation and an over-representation in
the PUMS files.
An examination of marriage rates further demonstrates problems with the population
sample at individual ages and gender beginning at age 65. Figure 6 shows estimates of the
proportion of women of each age who are currently married. In the 2007 ACS PUMS data,
which does not have the identified errors, women's marriage rates decline steadily from ages 60
to 75 as they become increasingly likely to be widows. In the 2006 ACS PUMS, which suffers
from the misapplication of disclosure avoidance techniques, marriage rates are particularly low
for 65 year-old women and particularly high for 68 year-old women.
Figure 6's estimates for 65-year-old women reveal that the women whose ages were not
reassigned (i.e., those who were still classified as 65-year-olds) had significantly lower marriage
rates than one would expect based on the corrected 2007 data. This illustrates that, beyond the

10
fact that there are not enough women in the PUMS files at age 65, the women that are there are
not representative of the whole set of 65-year-old women. This suggests that a non-random subset of 65-year-old women were reassigned to older ages or to be men. For example, most persons
with an age value of 65 in the PUMS file may actually be a different age—there is no reason to
believe that just because there is an undercount that the remaining sample is truly the age or sex
that they are assigned in the PUMS data. Clearly, the problems in Census and ACS age/sex data
are complex and analyses of any variable that is expected to grow or decline with each year of
age could be biased as a result of the misapplied disclosure avoidance techniques.

Who is affected by this problem?
We suspect that the problem with age and sex data for older adults is not widely known
among analysts relying on these data. After being alerted to the problem in 2008, the Census
Bureau created data notes (Data Note 12 and User Note 47) to let users know of potential
problems. However, these notes are not in locations where data users will necessarily see them.
Moreover, the emphasis of the data notes could give the impression that this is only an issue for
research that is specifically focused on sex ratios among the elderly.9 Finally, users have spent
nearly a decade using these data sources without being made aware of the problem. We believe
that the problems could be having broad-ranging effects for several different groups of stakeholders, discussed in turn below.
(1) Researchers who treat age as a continuous variable
These data issues raise serious concerns for researchers who analyze those ages 65 and
over in PUMS data. The problems with the data go beyond that which is currently described in
9

The Census Bureau's User Notes may focus on sex ratios because the authors of this paper stressed this issue when
describing the problem to census staff. Our subsequent research to understand the extent of the problem revealed
that sex ratios are one of many statistics that is impacted by the misapplication of disclosure review techniques.

11
the Census Bureau note (which implies that only sex ratios will be erroneously estimated in
PUMS files). As we document above, the issue is not simply that sex ratios could be inaccurate,
but rather that the sex and age data attached to each case is probably often wrong and the
remaining sample is not likely representative of the actual population at a given age and sex. It is
clear that PUMS files from the affected years should not be used by researchers for detailed
studies of the 65 and over population. Our research suggests that the data are only accurate when
grouped into a single 65 and over category. For example, our analysis of labor force participation
data shows that researchers interested in studying how the current economic downturn has
affected retirement behavior will be led astray if they use ACS (2003-2006) or CPS PUMS
(2004-2009) files in their analysis.
(2) Social service agencies that rely on PUMS data for important policy research
The second major group of stake-holders affected by faulty age and sex values is social
service agencies who rely on the PUMS. Census Bureau microdata products are widely used by
the policy research community and by government agencies, both for allocation formulas to fund
specific government programs and for more general program planning (Blewett and Davern,
2007). One important example of estimates that could be impacted by the underlying error in the
PUMS data are the simulations used to project the solvency of Old Age, Survivors, and
Disability Insurance (OASDI). Age-sex ratios are commonly used to derive program estimates
and for long-term forecasting for the OASDI Trustees Report.10
More generally, the Social Security Administration (SSA) also uses simulation models
"to estimate the effects of demographic and economic trends and legislative and policy options

10

http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2009/V_economic.html#189335

12
on various SSA programs and beneficiary populations now and in the future."11 Many of these
simulations rely on various census microdata samples. Because the population of greatest interest
to SSA is impacted by the errors outlined in this paper, SSA simulations could be significantly
biased. The Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management and the Budget also rely
heavily upon Census Bureau microdata to examine current programs and to assess the impact of
programmatic changes associated with proposed legislation (Glied, Remler, and Zivin, 2002).
In many cases, public use microdata from the decennial census and American
Community Survey are the only sources that can address the needs of these agencies. While the
most recent two ACS PUMS files do not have these errors, it is important to note that using
public use data for the 2000 Census or the 2003-to-2006 ACS may result in incorrect
calculations and provide an incorrect baseline for understanding long-term change. For example,
when a federal agency identifies significant change between the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, for
instance, they may be interpreting social change where the only real change has been in the
accuracy of the data.
(3) Survey researchers who use PUMS data to generate population estimates
Federal government agencies, survey data collection vendors, and pollsters regularly use
census data to construct survey weights. Tabulations generated from Census PUMS data are
often used in a process called "post-stratification," where preliminary survey weights are set so
that the sample cases sum up to Census Bureau totals by geography, age, sex, race, ethnicity, and
other key demographic variables.12 Post-stratification is commonly implemented using a
technique known as "raking," which could be sensitive to the age and sex errors in the PUMS.
Raking allows survey researchers to fit many control variables to their preliminary weighted total
11
12

http://www.fcsm.gov/01papers/SPWP31_final.pdf

13
to make sure the survey adds up to appropriate totals by, for example, age and sex within a
specific geography. The data errors in the Census Bureau's PUMS data products would
especially be problematic for those surveys that fit age by sex control totals from Census PUMS
categories in five-year increments and include people 65 years of age and older.
Researchers using any weighted dataset in which the weighting strategy relied on the
2000 Census or the 2003-2006 ACS PUMS samples need to consider the potential for errors in
their estimates. In such cases, researchers can investigate the potential error by charting any basic
demographic pattern by single year of age or by small age groupings, looking for unexpected
peaks or troughs in the statistics. As we have suggested above, the problems are severe enough
that they tend to produce visible divergences from expected patterns, such as was seen in sex
ratios and in sex-specific distributions of labor force status or marital status. Alternatively, one
could compare current estimates with those produced re-weight using information from a Census
PUMS file that does not have errors (such as the 2001 ACS PUMS file).
Researchers, policy-makers, and survey researchers have expressed a clear desire for
accurate year-specific age data in the PUMS files. In fact, many researchers and policy makers
spoke to this exact issue as the Census Bureau was preparing the 2000 PUMS data. At that time,
the Census Bureau was considering a plan that would significantly reduce the PUMS's singleyear age detail for persons over age 65. In the quotes below, just a small sample of responses to
a survey administered and published by the Census 2000 Advisory Committee, researchers from
a variety of backgrounds made their objections to this plan clear.13

My research is on the marriage patterns of older women (especially related to the Social

•

"With the aging of the population the key demographic issue in the U.S., grouping data at
the oldest ages poses a key threat to research on aging." (p. 61)

Data users need to be aware that, despite the Census Bureau's subsequent decision to provide
year-specific age data for the elderly, the misapplication of disclosure avoidance techniques has
resulted in PUMS files that contain data that must be grouped into a single 65 and over agegroup in order to provide accurate estimates of the population and behavior within it.

Correcting the Data
The most straightforward fix for this problem would be to release updated datasets of all
affected samples from Census 2000, the 2003-2006 ACS, the 2004-2009 CPS ASEC, and any
other datasets produced with the faulty disclosure avoidance techniques. An alternative approach
would be to release additional cases for households containing persons aged 65 and up, since
internal data files contain significantly more cases than are made public in the PUMS. The
Census Bureau could draw new correctly-weighted samples for households containing persons
aged 65 and up in these years. These data could then be used to replace households containing
persons aged 65 and up in existing PUMS files.
The Census Bureau and other data providers may be reluctant to take these approaches.
The Census Bureau's original user notes express concern that correcting the problem would
reveal too much information about the specific disclosure avoidance techniques currently being
used. Furthermore, there is always a reluctance to release additional cases, also for disclosure

15
avoidance reasons. The Census Bureau sees the public release of only a subset of cases as an
important part of its disclosure avoidance strategy.
It may be possible for the Census Bureau or the Bureau of Labor Statistics to correct the
problematic data while maintaining the integrity of the disclosure avoidance edit procedures. A
third approach that could potentially allow the Census Bureau to not identify which cases were
altered, and yet not release additional cases, would involve providing new weights for half of the
households currently in the PUMS files. Assuming that there is an accurate, representative subsample by age and sex contained within the PUMS files, a new set of weights could be created
that would identify such a subsample. This could be done perhaps by assigning a weight value of
0 to all persons in households containing a case that was affected by the error. In order to mask
the disclosure avoidance technique that was in error, one could also give an additional subset of
households that were never in error would a weight of 0.
Changing the weight values for the unaffected households would ensure that researchers
would not be able to identify the exact individuals who were affected by the erroneous disclosure
avoidance techniques. The remaining households would then receive an alternative weight
variable that researchers could use at their own discretion. Researchers focusing on groups below
age 65 could continue to use the old weights and the full case count. Researchers needing
accurate age information for those aged 65 and older could use the new weights, with the
understanding that they would only be analyzing a portion of the cases in the dataset.

Conclusion
Most Census PUMS files published since 2000 have serious errors with age and/or sex
values for persons ages 65 and up. Datasets with errors include the 2000 5% and 1% Census

16
PUMS, the 2003-2006 ACS PUMS, the 2005-2007 3-year ACS PUMS, and the 2004-2009 CPS
ASEC files. Until a solution is devised, researchers should not use the affected samples to
conduct analyses that assume a representative sample of the population by age and sex for people
ages 65 and older. For any analysis relying on the age variable, we would recommend treating
those aged 65 and older as a single analytic category (making no differentiation between men
and women), or eliminating those ages 65 and up from the analysis. The problems with these
data highlight the complexities inherent in modern disclosure avoidance techniques; the fact that
the erroneous data went undocumented until late 2008 is suggestive of how difficult it can be to
connect data anomalies to less obvious disclosure avoidance techniques. We hope that this
document helps data users and producers to better understand the problem and to avoid making
further mistakes with the flawed public data files.
