Following monetary union with west Germany in June 1990, the median real monthly consumption wage of east German workers aged 18-54 rose by 83% in six years. The median real
product wage rose by 112%. On the other hand, the employment rate fell from 89% to 73% for
this age group. The overall employment level, in uenced by early retirements, fell by about a
third between 1989 and 1992, when it stabilized. Although east Germany's employment fall is
not striking by European transition economy standards, it is an outlier in terms of wage growth,
the least dissimilar country being Poland, where real product wages rose about 25% in the years
following transition.1
The east German wage rises, coming on top of the wage rise implicit in the decision to unify
the currency at a one for one exchange rate, were pushed through by the powerful union structure
imported from the west. The unions could have had several motivations initially, and were not
necessarily interested in the welfare of easterners only. One motivation, of which the government
approved, was to use wages as the engine of convergence between east and west, in the interests of
equity. Other aims may have included restraining immigration from east to west and preventing
eastern rms from undercutting western prices. Many economists have inferred a causal link
between the post-monetary union wage rises and the employment falls, as well as the low levels of
outside investment in the east. Unions counter that wage increases are bene cial as the incentives
to invest in human capital are raised.2
Some of the aggregate wage arguments have implications for the distribution of wage growth.

Since employment falls have been greatest among the initially low paid, particularly women, wage
growth should be highest for those of this group remaining employed in order to be consistent
with unions reducing employment. This argument also implies that workers with the highest
wage rises should be at shrinking rms. Conversely, for wage rises to stimulate human capital
investment, presumably the wage rises should be highest for the skilled. The relative wage gains
of those moving to the west may be studied to see how the return to moving west changed as
eastern wages rose. The extent to which increases in the welfare of east Germans have been tied
to moving west is of interest to workers in other transition economies, who face legal and language
barriers to similar migration.
Whatever the e ects of the high the aggregate wage level, it is important that the distribution
of wage gains be conducive to the restructuring of the economy away from heavy industry and
industry making poor quality goods towards the service sector and more modern industrial sectors.
All formerly communist European countries had a large down-turn in the labor market around
1990, re ecting aggregate shocks such as the loss of export markets. Any long-run recovery is
dependent upon a reallocation of resources, which in the short term may prolong the diculties
in the labor market. This reallocation in turn depends on privatization of rms and investment
in capital generally, and appropriate returns to moving in the labor market. In the initial disequilibrium period one might hope to see high job turnover accompanied by high returns to moving.
In later periods, turnover rates and the return would likely fall. Given the large and enduring
employment fall, high mobility rates for those remaining employed would not be enough to make
analysts assess the east German labor market positively, but would give more cause for hope than
2

if mobility rates were low. Mobility could also be related to employment other than as a re ection
of employment reallocation. High mobility might indicate that the exibility to change jobs was
necessary for success in the labor market, and might suggest that some individuals who ceased
working did so because they lacked this unobservable exibility.
In this paper I examine year-to-year wage growth and its relation to individual characteristics, migration, job changing and, where possible, employment. I use longitudinal data from the
German Socio-Economic Panel for 1990-1996 for this purpose. Although existing papers examine
changes in the returns to characteristics such as education using yearly cross-sections, the huge
loss of employment means that the composition of cross-section samples changes a lot, and a different perspective may be gained from longitudinal data. I am not aware of existing papers that
exploit the longitudinal aspect of this data (or any other) to examine wage determinants in east
Germany.
The determinants of wage growth changed as time progressed. Wage growth between 1990 and
1991 was much higher for those with a low 1990 wage, which was re ected in the larger wage gains
of women and those in lower-paid educational groups. The relationship between initial wage and
wage growth was weaker for the 1991-1996 period, where year-to-year wage growth was largest
for women, the well-educated and younger workers. The relative wage gains of women were small
compared to their relative employment losses, however. The relation between initial wage and
wage growth, particularly for workers staying with the same employer, points to the in uence of
unions on the wage structure, as is con rmed by the slower wage growth at rms that in later
years withdrew from the bargaining process. However, no relation is found between wage growth
3

and employment growth at the worker's rm, although this might be the result of endogeneity.
Job-changing rates are found to be higher than in west Germany, and cumulatively to a ect
a much larger proportion of workers: of those working in both 1990 and 1996, only 40% had not
moved to a di erent rm by 1996, compared with 70% in the western sample. This suggests that
considerable restructuring has occurred, and contrasts with the results of Boeri and Flinn (1997),
who nd low mobility compared with Italy in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. In 19901991 workers moving to the west or changing jobs within the east experienced large wage gains
compared to stayers. Even in this period, however, the wage gains of stayers were large enough to
dominate overall wage growth. In later years returns to moving fell, as did moving rates. Thus,
over the 1990-1996 period only 18% of wage growth for the sample examined was associated with
a job change within the east, while 7% was due to movement to west Germany to work. The
share of wage growth due to job changing for a west German sample was not much lower, at 22%.
Although changing jobs was not necessarily the key to large wage gains in any given year, the fact
that a majority of those working in both 1990 and 1996 changed jobs suggests that being exible
enough to change may have played an important role in remaining employed at all.

1 Background and Existing Literature
Monetary union between east and west Germany took place on 1 July 1990. Some economic
changes had been occurring earlier in 1990, but monetary union marked the beginning of the
east's shock therapy. The immediate change in the wage system at this time was the conversion
4

of east German wage contracts into west German marks at a rate of one for one (Krueger and
Pischke 1995). The western trade unions gradually took over the eastern wage bargaining system,
and the conversion to the western system was accomplished in most industries over the course of
1991. As this happened, it became common for the unions to negotiate step-wise wage increases
designed to achieve convergence to the wage level of the equivalent western industry by 1994.
The contracts varied greatly according to the location and health of the industry, however, and
in December 1992 the monthly wages in e ect varied from 57.5% of western levels in the clothing
industry to 83% for construction in east Berlin. When factors such as the longer working week
in the east are taken into account, the ratios were somewhat lower. (See Bispinck and Meissner
1993.)
Subsequently, however, as economic conditions continued to be poor, employers reopened negotiations on the contracts, and unions agreed to delay convergence in some cases. Some newly
formed rms declined to join the relevant employer federation and were hence not bound by the
bargaining, while some other rms simply paid less than the bargained wage. Thus a survey of industrial rms by the Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung (German Institute for Economic
Research) in the winter of 1993-1994 found that 30% of rms were paying less than the originally
bargained wage in their industry, compared with only 10% for western industry in a separate 1993
survey. Only 40% of eastern rms reported belonging to their employer federation. However,
large rms were more likely to belong to the employer federation and to respect the bargained
wage, so the proportion of workers a ected by payment of wages below bargained wages was lower.
(Scheremet 1995.)
5

At the trough in 1991 GDP was two thirds of its 1989 level. Employment in 1991 was 75% of
the 1989 level of about ten million, and 65% by 1992, when it stabilized (see Buttler 1997). Note
that some of the employment decline occurred before monetary union. The female employment
rate fell ve percentage points more than the male rate after monetory union (see Hunt 1997). The
government adopted two measures designed speci cally to deal with employment decline: early
retirement and public works jobs. By 1993 866,600 people had retired early, and about 250,000
people were in public works jobs. The western system of short-time work, where workers are put on
reduced hours, and have their lost hours compensated at the replacement ratio of unemployment
bene ts, was widely used, particularly in the rst year of the transition (215,000 workers were
a ected in 1993). Government training programs have also been used (382,000 participants in
1993). (Kuhl 1994.) It has been common to ascribe the employment decline to the union wage
rises, and some analysts have called for wage subsidies to o set this (Bedau 1996, Bellmann 1994,
Begg and Portes 1992). It is worth noting the absence of much empirical support for this link in
any country (see, however, Boal and Pencavel 1994).
The most recent available statistics re ect the fact that eastern workers have progressed farther
than easterners generally. Eastern GDP per capita for the rst half of 1997 was 57% of the western
gure, measured in current prices, while the monthly earnings ratio was about 75% (and hence
the hourly wage ratio was slightly lower, since eastern hours are longer). There was little change
in the earnings ratio compared to 1996.3
GDP gures come from the Bundesbank web page www.bundesbank.de, population and
earnings ratio gures come from the Statistisches Bundesamt web page

Existing literature on east German wages has focused on cross-section analysis of either the
GSOEP or other data sets, often focusing on changing returns to attributes (Bird, Schwarze
and Wagner 1994, Krueger and Pischke 1995, Steiner and Puhani 1996). Steiner and Wagner
(1997) use Oaxaca decomposition to examine convergence between east and west, and observe
that convergence is driven by changes in returns to observable and unobservable characteristics
(see also Burda and Schmidt 1997). The results of these papers are not always the same, even
when the same data are used, with some nding falling and some rising returns to experience,
for example. Hunt (1997) presents only graphical analysis of the longitudinal wage data, but the
results appear consistent with a role for unions in the employment decline: wage growth from
1990-1994 was strongly negatively related to the 1990 wage percentile, while the probability of
remaining employed was strongly positively related to the 1990 wage percentile. Further, the
wage-employment link operated through layo s, rather than through voluntary separations. This
suggests unions may have caused larger employment declines among the less skilled by trying to
compress the wage structure. It is interesting to note, however, that wage inequality increased
slightly despite the negative relation between initial wage and wage growth.
A literature which has exploited the longitudinal aspect of the GSOEP wage data is the
literature on wage and income mobility, generally de ned in terms of transitions between quintiles
of the distribution. Examples of this rather large literature are Hauser and Fabig (1997) and
Steiner and Kraus (1996). The focus on relative wage changes is very di erent from the focus on
absolute wage changes in this paper.

2 Econometric Model
The diculty with any model of a transition economy is that the correct model changes over time.
For example, one would not expect the coecients on covariates in a wage regression to be the
same in 1990, just before monetary union, as in 1996, when something close to a market economy
had developed. Inspection of regressions run year by year suggested that the biggest di erence
was between 1990 and the subsequent years, and that the eciency gain from pooling subsequent
years outweighs possible bias from pooling years with di erent structural parameters. I therefore
propose that di erences in wages between years in the 1991-1996 period can be accounted for by
changes in the time-varying characteristics X and by an individual-speci c trend:
it

ln wit = 1i +

1i

t > 90;

where i indexes the worker and the Z are time-invariant covariates. The time-invariant individuali

speci c e ects  can be di erenced away, leaving individual-speci c e ects
it

1i

in the equation

for wage growth (due to the assumption of an individual-speci c trend in wages):
ln wit , ln wit,1 =

1i

11

(X , X ,1) +  ,  ,1
it

it

it

it

t > 91:

(2)

In principle I could di erence across any number of years, but I choose one year di erences so as
to include as many workers as possible in the analysis, and so as to exploit more naturally some
questions referring to events in the past year.
I hypothesize that the

1i

e ects may be predicted by the time-invariant covariates (workers

with certain observables are better able to adapt to the transition and achieve a faster wage

growth):
1i

Thus the nal equation is:

11

(X , X ,1) +  ,  ,1 + 1

t > 91:

(4)

For the 1991-1996 period I thus pool the observations on the pairs of years and assume that all
error terms are well-behaved and  exhibits no serial correlation, for example.
Wages in 1990 can be modelled:
ln wi90 = 0i +

01 Xi90

02 Zi

Di erencing 1991 and 1990 yields:
ln wi91 , ln wi90 = 10 i , 0i +

Xi90 +(

12

, 02 )Z +  91 ,  90 ;

10 i = 1i +91

1i :

(6)

Similarly to before I hypothesize that 10 , 0 can be predicted with the Z s:
i

i

10 i , 0i = 0 Zi + 0i :

(7)

Thus the nal equation for 1990-1991 wage growth is
ln wi91 , ln wi90 = (

02

+ 0 )Z +
i

11

Xi91 ,

01

Xi90 + i91 , i90 + 0i :

(8)

I estimate these equations using quantile regression, principally median regression. The advantage of median regression is that it is less sensitive to outliers in wage growth, which is important
as I have no way of judging in this context what constitutes reasonable wage growth. The use of
9

quantile regression at other quantiles sheds light on the distribution of wage growth of di erent
groups. I report bootstrapped standard errors based on 2000 repetitions (1000 in the case of the
western sample).

3 Data
The data used are from respondents to the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) who resided
in east Germany when that region was rst surveyed in June 1990, immediately before monetary
union. If these individuals moved to the west they were followed, and are retained in my sample.
The wage used is gross earnings in the month prior to the interview, not adjusted for end
of year bonuses. Wages are de ated according to residence in the east or west to give real consumption wages of comparable purchasing power. The time-varying covariates X controlled for
in equation (8) include tenure and hours worked per week (the only available hours variable), as
well as information on whether the individual changed jobs or region of work (east or west), year
dummies and industry of work. The time-invariant Z s include sex, education and age (age is of
course not time invariant, but it increments by one each year). To the extent that any of these
Z

variables do change over time, I use the value of the variable in the earlier of the pair of years.

Dummies for the federal state of the worker were always found to be jointly insigni cant in the
regressions, and are not included in the results presented.
I divide job changers into those who clearly moved involuntarily, and all others (termed voluntary movers). I also classify stayers according to whether their rm's employment had shrunk,
10

grown or been stable over the previous year. In 1995, by which time the industry-wide bargaining
process had begun to break down, respondents were asked whether their wages were determined
by collective bargaining. The in uence of this on the wage growth of stayers for 1994-1995 and
1995-1996 can thus be assessed. The data appendix gives more details on the data.
The sample is restricted to those for whom the wage is meaningful in both years of the pair
considered. Thus those working in agriculture and shing in either year or are self-employed in
either year are excluded. Also excluded are apprentices (who record very large wage gains when
they take up their rst real job) and those under 18 or over 53 in the initial year (thus eliminating
those who in some years were eligible for early retirement or other bene ts at age 55), and those
for whom the wage or any of the covariates used were missing. I include in the sample all workers
with non-zero hours. I also include those on public works jobs, who are not identi able in 1991.
3% of the sample observations for 1992 held a public works job, and the proportion declined
subsequently.
For the purposes of some descriptive statistics, I impose the same restrictions but for one year
only, so that the wage, for example, need only be valid in the current year rather than in two
successive years. I refer to this sample as the yearly sample to distinguish it from the wage growth
sample used in the main analysis. I also create yearly and wage growth samples for respondents
from the western sample of the panel, for purposes of comparison.

11

4 Descriptive Statistics
I rst use the data as repeated cross-sections using the GSOEP weights to generate time-series for
the east. I present information on wages and employment for workers 18-54 and the population 1854 respectively, in Figure 1. The top left hand panel shows the rapid growth of real consumption
wages over time at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile for the yearly sample of workers. The
median grew from DM 1627 to DM 2980, a growth of 83%. (The median wage growth of workers
in the yearly sample in both 1990 and 1996 was 89%.)
From the perspective of labor demand, nominal wages should be de ated with the producer
price index to give real product wages. The average of the log product wage, computed for the
subset of the yearly sample that is working in the east, is plotted in the upper right panel. It is
normalized to equal the average log consumption real wage, which is also plotted, in 1990. The
producer price index grew much less than the consumer price index, so that growth of product
wages was much higher even than that of consumption wages. The median 1996 product wage
was 112% higher than the 1990 median.
The lower left hand panel shows the evolution of the employment rate according to di erent
de nitions. If only those reporting full-time or part-time work or rm training are considered
employed, all the employment reduction (and more) came in the rst year. If those sporadically
employed or on short-time (including those with zero hours, an oddity of the east) are also considered employed, the reduction was spread over the rst two years. If those on short-time with
zero hours are not considered employed, the employment fall occurs in the rst year. The bottom
right hand panel uses average weekly hours including zeros as a proxy for total hours worked in
12

the economy, and this measure too shows all the reduction coming in the rst year. Also on this
graph is average weekly hours for those with positive hours (the yearly sample): east German
workers are not experiencing the large hours declines of the west.
Thus, while large wage gains occurred for two to four years, most employment measures show
all the employment fall coming in the rst year. The timing could still be consistent with a causal
connection from wages to employment: employment might have fallen greatly in the rst year due
to other shocks, but with a free market wage would then have risen gradually. The large wage
rises might be keeping stable an employment rate that would otherwise be rising.
Figure 2 plots kernel density estimates of the male and female wage distributions in 1990 and
1996 for the yearly samples in the east (upper panels) and west (lower panels). The left hand
panels plot the monthly real consumption wages, while in the right hand panels monthly wages
are converted to hourly wages.4 The eastern distribution seems to be converging to something
somewhat di erent from the western distribution. The gender di erence is smaller in the east,
strikingly so for hourly wages, while the male upper tail is much thicker in the west.
Tables 1a and 1b show the means of the variables for the wage growth sample described in the
previous section and examined in the rest of the paper, as well as for the corresponding western
wage growth sample. The rst column gives the mean either of the 1990 level of the variable or of
its change from 1990 to 1991. The second column gives the corresponding means for the pooled
pairs of years 1991-1992, 1992-1993 etc. The third column provides statistics on the pooled pairs
of years for the 1990-1996 western sample. Annual eastern real wage growth was an enormous 20

weekly hours, then divided by average weekly hours. This is done for east and west separately.

log points in 1990-1991, and averaged a still large 9 log points in 1991-1996, compared with an
average of 4 log points in the western sample.56
The most common form of education is the dual-system apprencticeship, which is the omitted
category in the regressions below. Vocational training implies training at a vocational school
without the practical experience in a rm, and applies to particular occupations, such as those in
the health industry. In the east the wage level of apprencticeship graduates is 20-25% lower than
that of otherwise similar vocational training graduates (see Hunt 1997). The \general schooling"
category groups those who end their education with neither type of training nor tertiary education.
The proportion of workers with only general schooling is much higher in the west.
Eastern tenure fell on average in 1990-1991, but rose on average between pairs of later years.
The big ow of workers to the west (this includes both those moving residence, and those merely
taking up a commuter job) occurred early on, with 4.5% moving from 1990-1991. The eastern
breakdown according to mover/stayer type shows the fall over time in the proportion of movers
and the proportion of workers at rms with stable employment over the previous year, along with
an increase in the proportion of shrinking and growing rms (once the missings caused by the
lack of information on rm employment in 1994 are taken into account). Western workers appear
much less aware of whether their rm is growing or shrinking and there are many more missing
Numbers reported for the west, other than regression coecients, are computed using the
GSOEP weights, which make a big di erence due to oversampling of western foreigners. The
western immigrant sample added to the survey in 1994 is dropped. To avoid using weights in
kernel density estimation, western foreigners were dropped from Figure 2.
6 For western log wages and western hours there is a big di erence between the average of the
individual changes and the change in the average. Average western wages only grew about 4% in
1990-1996, while average hours fell over the period.

values for this variable. The eastern job changing rates are considerably higher than for the west,
particularly for involuntary moves. The cumulative e ect of the east-west di erence over six years
is large, probably due not only to di erences in the rates but to di erences in the prevalence of
repeat moving. Of workers in the yearly sample in 1990, 85% in the western sample and 74% in
the eastern sample were working in 1996. Of these, 70% in the west but only 40% in the east had
reported each year that they had stayed with the same employer.
Below it shall be found that some eastern workers forced to change jobs involuntarily had wage
gains. It should be bourne in mind, however, that 47% of those losing a job involuntarily between
interviews were not working at the next interview date. This number was the same for the west.
Table 1b shows the changes in industry composition, which have been signi cant. The categories given here are those used in the regressions for the sample of movers only, but generally
controls for 27 industries are included { however, in the early years several of the service industries have no eastern workers.7 The main expansions in the east have been in construction and
government. Compared to the west, the east has a higher employment share in construction and
transportation, a lower share in industry and private services, and a similar share in government,
health and education, science and sport.
Table 1c shows that in the 1994-1996 period 74% of eastern stayers in the sample still had
wages set by collective bargaining, but that 20% reported setting their wages freely with their
employer. 3% indicated that their wages were not collectively bargained because they were in a
group not covered by the contract, 1% indicated that their wages were not collectively bargained,
I show the breakdown for 1990 and 1995, since I do not require a non-missing 1996 industry
for an observation to be valid for 1995-6 wage growth.
7

15

but did not indicate why not, and 3% had a missing value. The proportion settings wages freely
is not as much higher than for the west as was expected. Possibly workers who should have been
receiving the bargained wage but were not nevertheless identi ed with the collectively bargained
group.
The sample may be used to calculate the proportion of wage growth attributable to movers,
and this proportion is not found to be large. The total wage growth in the sample is computed
by adding together the absolute real wage increase in DM between pairs of years for all the
observations. For each observation the wage gain may be attributed to a \stay", a job change or
to a move to working in the west (since there is overlap I let the moves to working in the west
take precedence). There are also some individuals who between pairs of years cease working in
the west, which is generally associated with a wage fall. Over the whole 1990-1996 period, only
18% of the wage growth is due to job changes within the east, and 7% (net of returns) is due
to movement to the west. Only for 1990-1991 is the total share of changers considerably higher,
due to the larger gains from moving west: 15% due to job changes in the east, and 18% due to
movement to the west.8 A similar calculation for the west reveals that 22% of wage growth is due
to job changes.
The magnitude of the wage gain achieved between any two years appears to be importantly
related to the wage in the initial year, particularly in 1990-1991. Figure 3 presents for 1990-1991
and the pooled pairs of years 1991-1996 the Nadaraya-Watson non-parametric kernel regression
of the change in the log wage between the pair of years on the initial level of the wage. The
8

The analysis can be performed on changes in log wages and the results are very similar.
16

Epanechnikov kernel is chosen, along with a bandwidth of .05 and a grid of 100 points. To avoid
odd results from using a ne bandwidth at the tails I did not use the top and bottom 1% of
the initial wage observations. The relationship seems to be fairly linear, showing that those with
initially low wages had the highest wage growth. In the regressions below I will attempt to capture
this relationship using covariates other than the initial wage.

5 Results
5.1 Whole Sample
Table 2 shows median regressions for eastern wage growth for the 1990-1991 period. These and
all future regressions control for the worker's gender, age, and education in the initial year, here
1990. In the rst column the change in tenure is a covariate, while in later columns tenure in 1991
is replaced by direct information on whether a worker moved or not. In the third column dummies
for industry in the initial year are added, and in the fourth column the change in weekly hours
is added, which is appropriate if one is more interested in hourly wages than monthly earnings.
In the fth column I add the log of the initial wage to the covariates (except change in weekly
hours), to see to what extent the covariates have captured the relation of Figure 3.9
In column 1 the coecient on the female dummy is insigni cant while the coecient on age
According to the model presented, tenure and hours in 1990 and 1991 should be entered
separately. Nevertheless, since it changes the results imperceptibly, I use the di erence as it is
easier to interpret. One cannot generally reject the hypothesis that the hours coecients may be
entered in di erenced form.

is negative and signi cant although somewhat small: an age di erence of ten years implies a 1.2
log point (or about 1.2%) di erence in wage growth. Using a quadratic in age did not appear
to capture the relationship better. The coecients on the education dummies indicate that wage
gains were inversely proportional to education: those with vocational training, a group better paid
than the omitted apprenticeship group, had 5% lower wage growth, the highly educated university
group had 8% lower growth, while the small poorly educated general schooling group had 10%
higher wage growth. These results are consistent with the larger wage rises being amongst those
with initially lower wages, as was illustrated in Figure 3.
The coecient on change in tenure in column 1 is negative, indicating bene cial e ects of a
job change, but insigni cant. Adding a term in tenure squared did not appear to capture the
relationship better. By contrast, a move to the west (without taking the loss of tenure into
account) increased wages by a massive 42 log points.
Column 2 indicates that voluntary movers gained a statistically signi cant 14 log points. Since
moving to the west is controlled for, the magnitude indicates the gain to changing employer within
the east. The coecient on involuntary moving is insigni cant.10 The coecient on moving west
indicates a 36 log point gain. In this period it is appropriate to think of the typical mover to the
west as one having voluntarily separated from a previous employer, and such a person would thus
gain about 50 log points. The coecients on the moving dummies should not be interpreted as
the return to an exogenous move by a random worker, since voluntary and involuntary movers
Notice that the voluntary moving category probably contains many misclassi ed involuntary
movers, and its coecient is therefore probably biased down. The involuntary movers category
probably has few misclassi ed workers (see the data appendix).

are likely to be unobservably di erent from each other and from stayers. In the speci cation of
column 2, as in the others in the table, the coecient on tenure in 1990 is insigni cant.
The addition of industry dummies in column 3 makes the female dummy positive and signi cant, indicating 4% higher wage growth for women compared to men in the same industry. The
point estimates on the university dummy and on the vocational training dummy fall and the coefcient on the latter becomes insigni cant. The coecient on general schooling is also insigni cant
in this column.11
Column 4 adds the change in hours between 1990 and 1991 to the covariates. Not surprisingly,
the coecient on hours changes is positive and very signi cant. Controlling for hours reduces
the magnitudes of the coecients on the moving variables, although not signi cantly, but the
coecient on moving voluntarily becomes insigni cant. The direction of the change suggests that
movers may have increased their hours relative to stayers, the latter having perhaps been put on
short time.
The log wage is negative and extremely signi cant in column 5, and the R2 rises considerably
compared to column 3, suggesting the other covariates were not fully picking up the relationship
of Figure 3. The coecient implies that a 10% higher initial wage is associated with a 3.3 log point
lower wage growth, a fairly substantial magnitude. Controlling for the wage causes the coecients
on gender and education to ip sign: this presumably indicates that amongst those with a similar
wage in 1990, males and the well-educated were more likely to be experiencing a temporary bad
I have run a regression where I add dummies for the worker's second year industry to the
covariates of this column 3 speci cation (these results are not reported). This renders the coecient on moving voluntarily very small and insigni cant, indicating that all the bene t of moving
is coming from changing industry.

draw and hence to improve in the next period. Speculation about the meaning of the coecient
on the wage is deferred until the next section.
Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 repeat the speci cation of column 3 in Table 2 but using quantile
regression at the .25 and .75 quantiles rather than median regression. The sample remains the
same. This reveals some interesting di erences in the distribution of wage growth by stayer/mover
type, although the di erences are not always signi cant. The gain to working in the west appears
higher at the 75th percentile than at lower percentiles. The gap between the wage growth of
stayers and movers within the east similarly grows as the percentile considered rises. The 75th
percentile voluntary mover gained a huge 26 log points with respect to the 75th percentile stayer,
compared to only a 7% and insigni cant gain at the 25th percentile.
Table 4 repeats the regressions of Table 2 for the observations on the pooled pairs of years from
1991 to 1996, with year dummies added to all the regressions, and a dummy indicating whether
the worker was in the west in the initial year of the pair. Such workers would get only western
wage growth, which is lower. In these regressions \tenure" or \log wage" refers to the level of the
variable in the earlier of the pair of years to which the observation refers.
The female dummy is positive and signi cant in the regressions which do not control for the
wage. This is consistent with the nding in Hunt (1997) that although the male-female wage gap
is being closed partly through the exit from employment of low-paid women, some of the closing
is genuinely bene cial to women remaining employed. Again, in column 5, when the log wage is
controlled for, the coecient on the female dummy ips to negative and signi cant. The coecient
on the log wage itself is lower for the later period than for 1990-1991. The coecient on age is
20

negative and signi cant across the speci cations, but small.
The coecients on the education dummies are somewhat di erent from those in the 1990-1991
regressions, since in columns 1 and 2 it is university graduates who appear to experience significantly larger wage gains than the omitted apprenticeship graduates. The magnitude is smaller
than the educational di erences found for 1990-1991. As for the earlier period, the education
dummies are weakened by the addition of industry dummies in column 3 and 4.
The coecient on change in tenure (column 1) is insigni cant. In the other columns of Table 4
initial tenure has a positive and generally insigni cant coecient. The bonus achieved by moving
to the west fell over time, as wages in the west rose a little and wages in the east rose a lot, and
this is re ected in the much smaller coecient on the dummy for moving to the west in 1991-1996,
indicating 5-6% wage growth. Due to the fall in the point estimates, these coecients are in fact
statistically insigni cant.12 Workers in the west in the initial year have 4-6% lower wage growth.
The coecients on voluntary and involuntary moves in columns 2-4 are also generally insignificant. The point estimates indicate that the wage growth advantage of voluntary movers over
stayers has fallen greatly from 6-14% in 1990-1991 to only 1-3% here. Furthermore, involuntary
movers now have a median wage growth 3-5% below that of stayers in columns 2-4 (the di erence
is signi cant in column 2). Voluntary and involuntary movers are signi cantly di erent from each
other in column 2, and in column 3 at the 10% level. In this period, amongst movers to the
west, stayers (workers transferred to the western plant of a parent rm) are more common than
voluntary or involuntary movers. These workers gained the (insigni cant) 5-6% indicated by the

coecient on the coecient on moving west, while the wage gain for a voluntary mover to the west
was 8-9%, the sum of the moving west and voluntary moving coecients. This sum is signi cant
at the 10% level in columns 2 and 3.
Columns 3 and 4 of Table 3 report analysis of the 25th and 75th percentiles for the speci cation
of column 3 in Table 4. These results show that the wage growth distribution of movers is wider
than that of stayers. The 25th percentile of both voluntary and involuntary movers is a signi cant
8-10% below that of stayers, while the 75th percentile of voluntary movers is 16 log points higher.
The 75th percentile of involuntary movers is insigni cantly di erent from that of stayers, and the
coecient is positive.
The results for columns 3 and 4 in Tables 2 and 4 may be compared with the results for the
western sample in columns 1 and 2 of the Appendix Table. Wage growth di erences by educational
group are smaller in the west. Voluntary movers gain 4-5% in the west, more than in the later
eastern period, while western involuntary moving losses are smaller than those of the later eastern
period, but also insigni cant.13

5.2 Stayers and Movers Separately
The results of Tables 2-4 have revealed some interesting results about the distribution of wage gains
for movers relative to stayers, but since it has been shown that most wage growth, particularly
in later years, has been within job, it is worthwhile to examine the stayers more closely. In
Bender et al. (1998) and Burda and Mertens (1998) nd only small wage losses for displaced
west German males who were subsequently re-employed.

particular, it is of interest to know whether wage growth was positively or negatively correlated
with employment growth at the rm. This analysis is carried out for 1990-1991 in Table 5,
columns 1-3, using median regression. Column 1 controls for neither industry nor hours change,
while column 2 controls for both. Notice that in principle a worker can move to the west while
being a \stayer" if he or she transfers within the same rm. The coecients on sex, age, education
and tenure in these columns are somewhat similar to those in Table 2 for all workers.
When industry and hours are not controlled for, in column 1, the coecient on the dummy for
being at an expanding rather than stable rm is positive, signi cant, and large. It implies that a
worker at such a rm gained 15 log points compared to a worker at a rm with stable employment,
the opposite of what would be expected if rms with higher union wage rises are su ering greater
employment declines. The coecient on being at a shrinking rm is insigni cant, however, as is
the coecient on staying at a rm whose employment change is unknown.
As mentioned, however, unions took into account the fortunes of the industries in deciding on
the industry-wide wage rises, so it is not generally valid to exploit between-industry variation in
change in rm size. In the 1990-1991 period, wage rises granted by rms before the new industrywide unions were established may have led to within-industry variation in wage growth, although
this variation may be similarly endogenous. Also, from a labor demand stand-point, it is hourly
wages that are relevant, so the change in hours should be controlled for. Column 2 shows that
controlling for industry and hours renders the coecient on staying with a growing rm small and
insigni cant. In column 3 the initial wage, but not hours, is controlled for, yielding a coecient
on the wage slightly smaller than that in Table 2.
23

The rst three columns of Table 6 examine stayers in the 1991-1996 period, using the same
speci cations as in Table 5. Later in the 1991-1996 period there should be within-industry variation
in wage rises due to the break-down of the bargaining system. The coecients on gender, age,
education, working in the west in the initial year and wage are similar in the rst two columns to the
coecients in the corresponding columns of Table 4. The coecients on change in rm employment
are not signi cant in any of the three speci cations. It should be noted that, particularly in
comparison with the huge average wage rises, the standard errors are small, so that even quite
small di erences between the rm types can be ruled out. However, it is possible that the rms
leaving the bargaining process have been those that would have had the worst employment growth,
and the bene t of lower wages merely brings them back to average employment growth.14
Columns 4 and 5 of Tables 5 and 6 analyze the movers separately from the stayers. In column 5
the wage is added to the speci cation of column 4 { both include industry dummies, but exclude
the change in hours. Among movers, women do not appear to have higher wage growth (column 4).
Comparison of the results for movers and stayers indicates that workers reporting both moving
their workplace to the west and staying with the same employer do not experience wage gains,
while those changing employer voluntarily as they move to the west experience large and signi cant
gains compared to voluntary movers within the east: 26 log points in 1990-1991 and 15 log points
in 1991-1996 (column 4, Tables 5 and 6 respectively). This indicates that the growing share of
\transfer" movers to the west contributed (in a mechanical sense) to the fall in the return to
To make pronouncements in connection with labor demand, those stayers who are staying in
the west should be dropped from the sample. Doing so makes no di erence to the rm employment
coecients.

24

moving west as calculated for the whole sample.15
Another interesting di erence between the movers and the stayers is the coecient on the
wage (column 5), which is signi cantly more negative for movers in both periods, although the
di erence is much larger in the later period. The coecient on the log wage will be biased down
by measurement error, and could also represent a reversion to the mean tendency that might be
present in all countries. It is therefore informative to compare the reported eastern coecients
on the wage with their counterparts from similar western regressions for 1990-1996 (reported in
the Appendix Table columns 3-5). The western coecient for the full sample and the subsample
of stayers is between -0.05 and -0.03, while for the subsample of movers the coecient is -0.48
(all coecients are very signi cant). Together the results suggest that measurement error leads
to a small and signi cant negative coecient on the wage, that some sort of reversion to the
mean process among movers leads to a large negative coecient on the wage, and that something
particular is happening among eastern stayers, leading to an unusually large negative coecient
for this sample.
The wage rises for those eastern stayers with initially low wages should be viewed with the huge
employment fall for initially low earners in mind. The coecient on the log wage could represent
an e ort by the unions to keep the wage distribution compressed, which had large employment
falls as a side-e ect. Alternatively, it is possible that high wage workers were hoarded by rms
in the initial shock, despite a fall in the immediate need for all types of worker, and that those
In Table 5 column 1 the point estimate for \transfer" movers is large (although insigni cant).
Unreported results indicate that adding industry dummies even without adding the change in
hours reduces the coecient to the magnitude of column 2.

25

few low wage workers retained were retained due to a new recognition of their qualities, and these
workers then enjoyed large wage gains. Both of these stories are consistent with a large but falling
wage coecient magnitude amongst eastern stayers compared to western stayers.
In Table 7 I use 1994-1995 and 1995-1996 stayers only, and add the information on wage
bargaining. The rst column adds the bargaining covariates to the covariates of Table 6 column
2, and thus includes industry dummies. In column 2 the change in hours is also controlled for,
since in this situation hourly wages are probably the variable of most interest. In column 3 the log
wage is controlled for in addition. The results presented show that within industry the minority of
workers setting wages freely with their employer had statistically signi cantly lower wage growth
by about 2% than those with bargained wages, the excluded category, in the preferred speci cation
of column 2. This magnitude should be compared with the average annual wage growth for the
1994-1996 period of 5%, but seems lower than might have been expected. If the comparison
bargained wage group is contaminated by respondents whose employer is violating the agreement
with the union, the coecient of interest may be biased toward zero. Those individuals whose
occupation was excluded from the wage bargaining at their rm (typically upper level employees)
did not have signi cantly di erent wage growth from those with bargained wages.
I have run a regression interacting the dummy for setting wages freely with education, to
test whether unions help the less skilled more. I do not nd signi cant di erences by education,
possibly due to the small cell sizes (these results are not reported).

6 Summary and conclusions
In the six years following monetary union, consumption real wages in east Germany rose by 83%,
and real product wages by 112%. Wage growth is potentially the driving force behind convergence,
but possibly the cause of large employment losses. For 1990-1991 in particular the largest wage rises
were for those with an initially low wage. This is to some extent picked up by the other covariates:
women and those in lower-paid educational groups had larger wage gains. The relation between
initial wage and wage growth is not as strong in later years, and the groups with the largest wage
rises were women, those with tertiary education and younger workers. The greater wage gains of
the initially low paid, particularly stayers, and the fact that in recent years workers with wages
set by collective bargaining have had faster wage growth than other workers, seem consistent with
unions having a large e ect on the wage structure. However, wage rises were found to be similar at
growing, shrinking and stable rms. Wage growth and employment growth should be negatively
correlated if wage rises reduce employment, but endogeneity may be an issue.
Of workers employed in both 1990 and 1996, only 40% were with the same rm in 1996 as
in 1990, compared with 70% in the western sample. This high mobility rate should be a sign
that the economy is progressing well with restructuring, but this must be weighed against the
large employment falls that have occurred. In spite of high mobility, over the period 1990-1996
only 18% of wage growth was attributable to job changes within the east, and 7% to moves to
working in the west. For 1990-1991 15% of growth was due to within-east moves and 18% to
moves to the west. This compares with a share of 22% for job-changing in the western sample.
Thus although changing jobs was not necessarily the key to large wage gains in any given year,
27

the high mobility rate over the whole period suggests that having the exibility to change jobs
might be an important generally unobserved determinant of being employed at all.
The returns to moving were high in 1990-1991, but fell over time, as did mobility rates. Movers
voluntarily leaving their employer to go to the west in 1990-1991 had wage growth 50 log points
higher than those staying in the east. As eastern wages rose relative to western, however, the
gain to such a move fell to about 8-9% (signi cant at the 10% level) averaged over 1991-1996.
Workers transferring west within the rm experienced no wage gain, and an increase in their share
of movers to the west also contributed to the fall in the gain to moving west. Amongst voluntary
job changers, those moving west in 1991-1996 gained a signi cant 15 log points relative to those
moving within the east, compared to 26 log points in 1990-1991. As for those changing rm within
the east, in 1990-1991 involuntary movers had median wage growth insigni cantly di erent from
that of stayers, while voluntary movers gained 10-14 log points over stayers. In the period 19911996, however, voluntary movers' advantage had fallen to an insigni cant 1-3%, while involuntary
movers had an insigni cant 3-5% lower wage growth than stayers.
Examination of quantiles other than the median reveals that the gain to moving voluntarily
within the east was higher at the 75th percentile than at lower quantiles in both 1990-1991 and
1991-1996. In fact, in 1991-1996 both voluntary and involuntary mover wage growth were lower
at the 25th percentile than wage growth of stayers. The gain to working in the west was higher
at the 75th percentile than at lower percentiles in 1990-1991.

Data Appendix
The wage used is gross earnings in the month prior to the interview, not adjusted for end of year
bonuses. Wages for respondents living in the west are adjusted using the western consumer price
index (1991=100). The eastern consumer price index is adjusted so that a meaningful comparison
of the price levels between east and west may be made, using the results of a 1991 study of the
relative price levels in the east and west (Krause 1994). The wages of those living in the east are
thus de ated with this adjusted index, so that the real wages of those in the east and west should
have comparable purchasing power. It should be noted, however, that the price index for the east
in 1990 is not considered as reliable as in the subsequent years.
In my analysis I exploit information about changing jobs, and moving or commuting to the
west. Each year respondents are asked whether any change has occurred in their job, and if so
what type of change and the reason for its occurring. Possible changes include a job change within
the rm and the take-over of the rm by another. I generally group both of these with the group
with no change. I do not consider take-overs separately because the phrasing of the question about
whether a change has occurred seems likely to induce many respondents experiencing a take-over
to answer that no change had occurred. Also, examination of separate questions on rm ownership
and founding date suggests respondents are confused on this subject (as they tend to change their
answers from year to year in the absence of any change in their job). 6% of the 1990-1991 and 1.5%
(per year) of the 1991-1996 sample reported a rm take-over. For job-changing rates within the
rm the corresponding gures were 6% and 3%. Those respondents who reply that they changed
job because they were laid o or red or their rm closed I categorize as involuntary movers. All
remaining respondents, which include some whose voluntary nature is ambiguous, I categorize as
\voluntary" movers.
Whether a respondent is living in the west should be well measured, as it is recorded by the
survey takers. Whether a respondent is commuting to the west is a question asked separately
from the moving questions described above. I group those living in and commuting to the west
into the variable indicating working in the west.
In addition to classifying movers, I also classify stayers according to whether they reported
that employment at their rm had been growing, shrinking or stable over the previous year. This
question was not asked in 1994, however. Stayers who changed job within a rm or who stated
that their rm was taken over are assigned a missing bargaining status, since their bargaining
status could have changed.
