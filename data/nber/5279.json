The results show that monetary policy is an important determinant of the term structure spread,  but it unlikely to be the only determinant. In addition, there is significant predictive power for both real activity and inflation.  The yield curve is thus a simple and accurate measure that should be viewed as one piece of useful information which, along with other information, can be used to help guide European monetary policy.\n\n",
