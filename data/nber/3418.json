This\npaper analyzes such speculative attacks and their implications; it shows that the recently developed \"smooth pasting\" model of target zones should be viewed as a special case that emerges only when reserves are sufficiently large. The paper then uses the target zone framework to resolve a seeming paradox in predicting speculative attacks on a gold standard, arguing that such a standard may best be viewed as the boundary between one-sided target zones.\n\n",
