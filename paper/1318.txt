The Heights of Europeans since 1750:
A New Source for European Economic History

ABSTRACT

Economic and social historians have traditionally been concerned
to measure changes in the income and welfare of populations in the
past.

Until recently, however, they have not recognized that

anthropometric data, such as evidence on the average height achieved
by a population at a particular age, provide sensitive indicators
of the average nutritional status of that population.

Records of

conscription into the armies of eleven European countries betweeen 1761
and 1975 provide 114 observations of mean height.

Using 614 obser-

vations, the paper explores the relationship between mean height and
other indicators of health and welfare, in particular the level of
GDP per capita and the level of infant mortality.

Western European

heights are shown to have responded systematically over the past hundred
years to changes in income and disease, just as heights in the modern
world respond to similar changes today.

Average height is powerful

evidence of the nature and extent of economic development.

The Heights of Europeans since 1750:

a new source for European Economic History

*

European economic historians have been preoccupied,
since the foundation of their academic discipline,'with the
study of the profound economic changes which have taken

place in Europe during the past two hundred years. Recent
studies in many countries have established the main

outlines of those changes, the growth of manufacturing
industry, the decline of agriculture, the increasing
importance of foreign trade and the decline in the rates of
growth of population, which occurred at various times in all
European countries. Yet the effects which these changes have
had on the people of those countries has remained curiously

the
peoples of Europe has changed enormously during the transition
from feudalism, but the exact delineation of that change has
remained elusive.
In the past, the problem of measuring changes in the
standard of living tas -been- seen by historians -as - predominantly
a problem of data collection.
It was assumed t1at, once
sufficient data on prices and wages had been collected, the
difficult to establish; the standard of

living

of

measurement of real wages could follow; even if microeconomic data had been lost, methods such as national income
analysis,

combined with more accurate measurement of

population changes, could provide a guide to movements in

real incomes per capita. it is true that

knowledge

of the

2

distribution

of income is crucial to such analysis, but it

can often be assumed or inferred from tax data or similar
material. There are, in addition, many statistical
difficulties, such as those of the choice of weights, the
choice of base periods and the choice of the most appropriate
analytical method, but there have been improvements in our
knowledge of all these difficulties, so that they seem
now either solved or capable of solution, at least at the

levels of accuracy which are needed for studies of long-term
historical processes.

It is probably inevitable that, at the time when so many
of the problems which preoccupied earlier academic studies
of the standard of living seem to be near to solution,

economic historians should

begin

to feel dissatisfied with

the measures which they have spent so long trying to make.

This dissatisfaction was

succinctly expressed some time

ago, in a debate on the British standard of living, when
Eric Hobsbawin wrote that "Man

their attention only on the measurement of real wages, then

class. E.P.Thompson was right, therefore, to give equal
emphasis to "Experiences" and to "Standards" in his

discussion of this subject in The Making of the English
Working Class (Thompson 1968)

As the mention of Hobsbawm and Thompson shows, (and
many others could be cited) historians have not usually
ignored the deficiencies of measures of real wages. Their
problem has been that, if they wish to consider other life
experiences as part of the standard of living, they have to
be able 1o weigh up ore experience against another, to judge

whether an increase in real wages was brought at too high
a price in misery, ill-health and increased mortality.

poor to be persuasive.

What is needed, in fact, is a measure which will in some

way sum up all the facets of experience which make up our
standard of living, or will do so for substantially more of

them than are summed up in measures of real wages. This

eighteenth

century.

L.

Auxology and history
Historians are unfamiliar with the idea that
measurements of height and of other aspects of human
physique are of any relevance to the measurement of
standards of living.

Some early work of Emmanuel le Roy

Ladurie and others in this field was sceptically received
and was not followed up or emulated.

(Aron et al. 1972)

By contrast, human biologists and physical anthropologists
have long believed that growth in humans is responsive to
changes in the environment.

An early pioneer in the

measurement of human growth was Adolphe Quetelet (1796187Ll), a Belgian whose work was widely known throughout

Europe and who, at the same time as L.R. Villerme in France,
surveyed the growth of children and adolescents and sought to
describe and explain its principal features.

The work of

Quetelet and Villerme' stimulated Edwin Chadwick, in England,

to organise surveys of the heights of children in factory

districts in the 1830s. Since that time, the study of
human growth or 'auxology' has become a scientific
discipline in its own right and has given rise to numerous
surveys of growth throughout the world.

(Tanner 1981;

Eveleth and Tanner 1976).

These studies are based on the belief, now well
established, that
"A child's growth rate reflects, better than any
other single index, his state of health and

nutrition; and often indeed his psychological
situation also.

Similarly, the average value of

children's heights and weights reflect accurately
the state of a nation's public health and the

5

average nutritional status of its citizens,

when appropriate allowance is made for
differences, if any, in genetic potential.

This is especially so in developing and

disintegrating countries. Thus a well-designed
growth study is a powerful tool with which to

monitor the health of an opulation, or to -

pinpoint

subgroups of s population whose share

in economic and social benefits is less than it
might be." (Eveleth and Tanner 1976:1)

It is for this reason that the World Health Organisation
arid other bodies make use of measurements of growth to

assess the efficacy of health and development programmes
in the world today.
indicate
Growth measures, as Eveleth and Tanner say/the 'average
nutritional status' of those measured. That is, h13Thfl

growth

reflects not only the input of nutrients in the form

of food and drink, but also the demands which the growing
child and adolescent places on his body. Nutrition is
required for body xnaintenace, for work or other physical

activity and for growth; if the nutrition is inadequate
to sustain the body in a healthy state, or if the demands
of work are excessive, growth will be retarded or, in the
extreme case, will cease al-together. In addition, disease

can place extra demands on the body for additional

nutrients; if these are not forthcoming, growth will again
be affected. 'Nutritional status' is thus a net rather
than a gross measure of nutrition; it measures not what
the human body takes in (as in studies of diet which are
familiar to many historians) but what the body makes of

6

those nutrients when combined with other pressures and
requirements.

The pattern of growth in childhood and adolescence is

clearly both in historical series such as those compiled
by Quetelet, in modern studies of the under-developed
world and in modern studies of the developed world; the
timing of particular events, such as the adolescent growth
spurt or the achievement of final heights, varies between
different genetic groups within the world population, but
the overall pattern is common to all.
Within particular genetic groups, such as the white
European populations, variations in nutritional status
produce variations in the timing of growth, and the
extent and nature of such variations from the pattern and
timing found in a well-nourished population give a guide
to the nature and severity of mal-nutrition (in the widest
sense of an imbalance between nutrient intake and the needs
of the body).
Since a frequency distribution of heights
at a given age corresponds very closely to the normal or
Gaussian distribution, and since the standard deviation of
such a distribution is standard in adolescence and
adulthood at about 6.4 cm., it is conventional to describe
the mean heights of other populations as falling, for
example, between the 3rd and 5th centile of the current
British height distribution.
Such a description means

that the mean height of a given population is lower than
the heights of all but 95 per cent of the current British
population, but higher than that of 3 per cent of that
population.

7

An episode of malnutrition, such as a famine, can delay
growth and therefore cause the curve of growth of a
malnourished population to deviate from that of a wellnourished population.

If the malnutrition is short-lived,

however, it is likely that children and adolescents will

resume growth once the episode is passed; they may even
grow faster, in a phenomenon known to auxologists as
'catch-up' growth and thereby achieve final heights similar
to those which they would have achieved had the famine not

taken place. This phenomenon was observed, for example,
in the aftermath of the Dutch 'hunger winter' of 1944.
(Stein et al. 1975)

If the malnutrition is prolonged,

perhaps beginning at the foetal stage and affecting both
childhood and adolescence, then growth will typically be
slower than for a well-nourished population and the final
height which is achieved may well be consequently less.

This emphasis on the environmental or nutritional causes
of variation in growth may seem to be at odds with the
common emphasis on genetic causes of variations in heights

and other bodily characteristics. There is no doubt that
the overall pattern of growth is genetically determined,

nor that a substantial part of an individual's growth is
inherited from parents, but there is also substantial
evidence that most of the variation of average heights of
populations within very large ethnic groups, and certainly
most of the variation of the average heights of sub-groups
within those populations, is determined by environmental
rather than genetic factors.

Two signs of this are that

"the mean heights of well-fed West Europeans, North American

8

whites arid North American blacks are nearly identical"

(Fogel et al. 1982: iO5) and that in all western European
societies (with the recent exception of Sweden) social

class is closely correlated with average height. A further
indication of the importance of environmental influences on
average height is that in the world today there is a very
strong correlation between average height arid per c'apita

national income (Steckel 1983).

At the same time, the importance of genetic factors and
the nature of their interaction with environmental and
socio—economjc factors should not be underestimated. As
Evele-th and Tanner put it:

"Such interaction may be complex. Two genotypes
which produce the same adult heights under
optimal

environmental circumstances may produce

different

heights under circumstances of privation.

Thus two children who would be the same

a given, well—nourished population, there

is no correlation between tempo and final height:
tall men are as likely to have been late as to have

different levels of nutrition, the correlation is
far from close. A population which is short at age

population, in historical data increasing mature
size usually is accompanied by increasing tempo

of growth. But the two should certainly not be
regarded as inseparable ....."

(Tanner

1982:575)

This difficulty makes it important for auxologists to
examine, so far as possible, the whole pattern of growth
of a population, rather than simply the average height
achieved at one particular age.

Even though there remain many puzzles connected with
human growth, the outlines of the process of growth and its

connections with environmental influences are clear. Growth
is a measure of nutritional status, of the synergistic

relationship between nutritional intake, work effort, and
health.

In the light of this modern knowledge, it is interesting

10

that Karl Marx, .presumably aware of the work of Quetelet,
Villerme' and Chadwick, used height statistics in his

discussion of the impact of indutrialisation. He referred
in Capita], to J. von Liebig's description of the declining

health of the French and German populations as shown by
the condition and height of their military recruits and
argued that this decline in England had made factory
legislation necessary:

"The limiting of factory labour was dictated by
the same necessity which spread guano over the

fields. The same blind eagerness for
plunder that in the one case exhausted the soil,

had, in the other, torn up by the roots the living

of the

nation. Periodical, epidemics speak on

point as clearly as the diminishing military

standard in Germany arid France." (Marx, 1867;

1961: vol 1, 239)

The Evidence

Marx draws

our

attention to

the principal source of

evidence for the study of humn heights in Europe over the
past two centuries. Records-of mil-itary--recruitinent, which
survive in vast quantity, typically contain information on

height of the recruit. This information appears -to have
been collected and recorded for two m2ifl reasons. First,
the

it was coimnonIroin the

eighteenth century onward to require

that a recruit should be taller than some defined standard
of height. As Tanner puts it:
"Tall soldiers were preferable to short ones. Not
only were they generally stronger; they could cover

11

more ground on the march because of a greater
length of stride, and in combat they could
reach further with the bayonet and load itiore

easily the long-barrelled muskets of the time,
in which the charge had to be rammed down the

muzzle. The custom of having troops march in

step, introduced about 1700 in Prussia, seta
limit to permissible differences in height; and
the requirements of ceremonial .....demanded a

sclised corps whose heights had a still smaller
range." (Tanner 1981:98)

Potential recruits were, therefore, measured to make sure
that they could pass the height standard. The second
reason for measurement, arid the reason why the measurement

was recorded along with other details of the recruit, was
to enable him to be identified, a particularly important
need in an age when desertion was frequent and when, as in

England, recruits were known to join and desert in order
to obtain the "King's shilling" several times over.

For these reasons, heights of recruits were recorded as
early as the first half of the eighteenth century, in Norway
froni1741;-and soon afterwards in England from 1755 and in
Sweden from 1767. Other countries followed as conscription
aria the growth of standing armies increased the

bureaucratisation of military affairs. Conscription brought
with it, in addition, ..a new development., for -it was -common.

for conscription to be based on the inspection of very large
sections, if not the whole, of the young male population on

a regular basis, This practice gives rise to the survival,
to our own day, of records of heights and other physical

12

and social characteristics, such as occupation arid place

of birth or residence, for entire populations of young men.

The records of different European armed forces exist in
many different forms and information survives in them about
the heights of many millions of soldiers. Table 1 presents
in summary form the results of investigation of these

records by human biologists and historians, together with
some information from modern periods drawn from sample
surveys of the stated population. It is not possible,
unfortunately, to be entirely certain that the results are

ctrictly comparable one with another, since military
recruiting practices varied from time to time and frtm place

to place. In some countries, for example, conscription gave
rise to measuremerrts of the entire male population at a

particular age; in others, only those young males 'ñio were
actually selected for military service were recorded. In
some, volunteer armies were the norm .and the records of

heights stem, therefore, from a self-selected sample which
may not be representative of the male population. It is

unlikely, however, that these differences in the nature
of the statistics are large enough to vitiate comparisons
over time and between the countries listed in the table.

Interpretation of Table 1 requires some attention to the

of

human growth which was discussed above. Since

speed of growth and the absolute height achieved

at a particular age can vary between populations and between
different time periods, it is necessary to adopt a common
standard against which to set measurements of height which

were conducted at different ages. In the 5th column of
table 1, therefore, the absolute average heights in cm. are

13

accompanied by a measure f their relationship to the modern
English standard.

Each average height is expressed as an

approximation to the quintiles of the English standardfor
the age at which meaairements took place or, in the case of

men measured older than 18, the quintiles of the modern
British population of 18 year old males. (In a few cases,

with very short population, the 3rd percentile is also useth)
In the section for Belgium, for example, the figure '10'
in column 5 against the measurements of Houze for 1880-82

shows that Belgian males of 19-25 at that time had a mean
height greater than

that of 5

per cent of modern British

males aged 18 but less than that of 90 per cent. Later in
that table, the measurement of Twiesselmann suggests that

Belgians in 1969 had a mean height greater than that of
•

45 per cent, but less than that of 50 per cent, of modern
British males; that is, by 1969 the Belgian and the British

were very close in stature. The mean height of
20-year old Italians in 1874—6 was l?ss than the height of
all but 97 per cent of the modern British, while, at the
other extreme, the mean height of 18-year old Dutch males
in 1975-was greater-tha the ileight--of-ail--bu-t-20--per -cent- of the modern British population.

years in the average hghts of Western European populations.
Why did these changes occur?

1I

Human biologists, from Villerm onwards, have consistently
emphasised the importance of the environment in promoting
or retarding human physical growth. They have devoted a
great deal of attention to the effects of malnutrition
and other forms of deprivation on individual health and
growth and, in their studies, have demonstrated how improved
nutrition and control of disease can produce immediate and
dramatic effects on the growth of children. (Nartorell and
Klein 1980). At the level of whole populations rather than
individuals, human biologists have also shown that in almost

Britain, for example, class differences in hghts can be

matter of casual observation — reinforced by a study of
Eveleth and Tanner's Worldwide Variation in Human Growth
(1976) — that the richer countries in the world tend to be
to

the

countries with the taller populations.

Economists and historians have been slow to understand

the po±en±ial nf thisodyotscienti

own disciplines. The clear implication of the study of human
biology is that human height responds to, and is a
sensitive measure of, differences in the standard of living
of human populations from one time to• another, froni one place

to another and from one social class to another. Changing

height

is, in other words, a function of economic and social

15

change.

Since this is so, historians and economists should

seek to use measures of height in their description of the
economic and social development of nations and should also
try to understand more fully the exact relationship between
height and social and economic factors.

A start has recently been made in the use and explanation
of evidence about changes in human height. A group of
economists and historians from Britain and the United States,

working under the leadership of Robert Fogel of the University
of Chicago, have studied data from Britain, from the British
Wezt Indies and from the Ajnericari

colonies

and the United

States. The first results of these studies have recently
appeared in a special issue of Social Science History and
provide a number of striking findings: there appears,

for

example, to have been very l.tttle difference between the

average adult height of white American-born males at the
time of the American Revolutionary War, during the American

Civil

War and at the time of the second World War, although

average heights probably both rose and fell between those

dates; rises and falls over time occurred in the heights
of poor children in London between 1770 and 1870, with a very

-1810 and 1820 had a significantly reduced chance of

1982; Floud and Wach-ter 1982; Friedman

1982).

These

studies are continuing with the collection of very

large

of data about the heights of military recruits in
Britain and the United States, which will make it possible
to describe changes in heights in those countries from the
amounts

middle of the eighteenth century until the present day.

In an associated study, Steckel has sought to explore the
nature of the relationship between social and eoonomic
factors and height, by studying the range of height which

sobservable in the modem world. (Steckel 1983)
drawn on the work of human

biologists

He has

to provide 163

examples of average adolescent heights from different
societies in the modern world, together with 30 examples of
average adult heights, and has tried to explain the

variation in those heights by reference to the per capita
income of the countries from which the height data were
derived, and to a number of other measur*able factors which
may have a bearing on height differences. These include the
extent of income inequality, the racial composition of the
populations and the extent of urbanisation. Stecke]. found

that there

was a very strong correlation between the average

height of a population arid

logarithm of per capita
income of the economy from which the population was taken,
and that the addition of information on income inequality
the

within the society made the statistical relationship
between

height and these social or economic factors even

stronger.

Steckel warns in his article tiat there is no reason to

believe that the relationship between height and its
socio—economic determinants should remain steady over long
periods of time:
"Improved medical technology probably shifted the
relationship between average height and per capita
income. Knowledge of the germ theory of disease, for
example, enabled individuals to improve health, arid

therefore increase height, with no change in income."

17

(Steckel 1983:1_5)

Nevertheless, Steckel's results provide a stimulus to

investigate whether similar relationships between height and
socio—ecoliomic factors existed in the past, even if the

relative effect of different factors differed from those
which can be observed today.

It is agreed by human biologists that income is a
primary determinant of height, while Steckel's work suggests
that the distribution of the national income can also affect
the average height of that nation. It is also agreed that
disease can have substantial effects on individual and
population average heights. This knowledge makes it sensible
to investigate whether the changes in European heights which
have occurred in the past, and

the

differences

between

nations, can be explained by reference to the
incomes and disease patterns of those nations. Such an
investigation can only be carried out for the relatively

European

recent past, since adequate information on national income

the time concerned. No information on the level of
inequality of incomes is available for most countries, so
Steckel's analysis cannot be repeated in this respect with
and at

historical data.
The relationship between height and these socio—economic

factors

has therefore been investigated, for those 64 cases,

i8

by regression analysis. The results are given in table 2,
and the notes to the table give greater information on the
sources of the data which were used. The results show that
both the level of infant mortality and the level of gross
domestic product per capita have exerted a strong influence

on European heights. Indeed, taken together with the other
variables in the regression equation, these factors explain
about 96 per cent of the observed variation in heights
between and within western European populations since 1880.

they had taller populations at given levels of GDP per

France, and Switzerland showed no significant difference
from the Italian experience.
Duiruny variables were also employed to discover whether

the nature of the relationship between height and GDP per

the course of time. The fact that dummy variables for the
inter-war and post-war periods have no statistical
significance demonstrates that there was no change between
periods in that relationship.

levels of income, if Steckel's equation and that for the

European heights were each taken as a complete description
of the determninants of height. This close correspondence

suggests that there have been no major changes over time in
the relationship between height and income and that Steckel
was too cautious.

European height raises many

questions of

interpretation.

As is almost always true, neither the :dependent variable
in the equation, height, nor the independent variables are

20

measuring

quite what they are supposed to measure. The

difficulty with the measures of height is that a
substantial number of them may not be of final adult

heights. In modern Britain, and probably in most western
European countries, the average height of the male
population aged 17.5 is approximately 98 per cent of the
average adult height. (Tanner 1978:19) This reflects the -

tempo of growth of modern, well-nourished children and implies
that virtually all growth in the population average has ceased

by the age of 19 or 20. Tanner has noted, however, that
".....

in

historical data increasing mature size

usually is accompanied by increasing tempo--of -

growth.

But the two should certainly not be

regarded as

inseparable

......".

(Tanner

1982:575)

Evidence from British sources shows that it is likely that
the lower heights in table 1,drawn from earlier periods or
from populations with lower incomes, were the product of a
slower grow-th than is normal today...(Floud and Wachter1982)

If that is so, then some of the measurements of the average
heIghts of 19 or 20 year olds in table 1 are somewhat lower

than

mature heights, since

1 or2per-ceTrt--of

significant growth

—

at

least

final—height-----migh-t--stii3.. occur----In

other words, the different average heights in table 1 may
no-t.be strictly comparable,as they shoild be in the

statistical analysis.
This difficulty is. formally.irsuperab1e, since so many

of

the data relate to army

conscripts

where measurements

were taken at one age and where, therefore, very little if
any information is available for other ages. However, it may
not- be very serious in practice. First, modern studies of

2].

malnourished

populations suggest that it is unlikely that

the tempo of growth would have been delayed by more than two
years; 98 per cent of final height would -therefore have

been reached at the latest at the age of 19.5. This implies
that, for almost all the cases in table 1, the measurement
must be within two per cent of final height. While this is
not an insignificant amount - two per cent of 165 6m, for
example, is 3,3 cm. —

it is small in comparison with change

in heights which has occurred in most countries. It is

therefore unlikely that the results of the regression
analysis would be seriously disturbed by correcting for
tempo, impossible as this would be in practice. Second,

as Tanner points out, tempo of growth and mature final size

are to a considerable extent independent of each other, even

for population data; both are thought to be responsive to

nutritional change, though which nütrjtjoJ. change affects

which outcome is still ucwn. Since they are largely
independent of each other and responsive, to nutrition, the
fact that some of the measurements in table 1 relate to

populations who had not yet reached mature height does not
matter, since delayed attainment of final height is an

indication of a nutritional state less good thanthatDf
modern Europe.

The independent variables in the equation, income and
disease, are also less well measured by the data which are

available -than they should be. Stecke1s
very strongly that

per

results.suggest

capita gross domestic product i an

inadequate measure of income, since he found that

the distribution of income is important in explaining height
in the modern world. In addition, infant mortality is an

22

inadequate

measure of the disease environment, since modern

evidence shows that diseases of childhood and

affect growth

in

adolescence

populations which have survived the period

of infancy.

The effect of omitted variables, such as income
inequality, or of inadequately measured variables,, such as

health or disease, may be reflected in the regression
analysis, at least in part, by the dummy variables which
represent systematic differences between countries. If, for
example, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark had
•-.ystematically lower levels of income ..inequality, or if

1thue areas had a different disease environment, perhaps
for climatic reasons, then that might explain their taller

populations. Another possibility,which will be explored in
future analyses

of

this

material, is

that these differences

between countries reflect differences in the age at which
recruits

were measured. However, table 1.

shows that only in

were recruits significantly older on

Denmark

average than in

Italy, so it is unlikely that this

possibility will explain more than

a part of

the height

differences between countries. The issue deserves more
study and

the

collection of more relevant data.

There remain two more technical points;First, Steckel

suggests that there is a circularity in regarding adult
height as being determined by average income, since if adult
males are healthier and stronger they will produce more and
thus increase income. This difficulty can be circumvented

in

a statistical

sense by using

a different regression

method, that of two—stage least squares, and

Steckel's

results are based on that method. However, it is doubtful

23

whether enough additional data on the determinants of
income are availabie, in historical periods, to make this.

method work; Stecke]. also found that "The results for adults
are not sensitive to the method of estimation" (Steckel 1983:

7, n. 32) and it therefore seems unlikely that the results
for European heights would be significantly changed if a
different method were used.

Second, there is a high correlation between gross domestic

infant mortality, for

prorduct

per capita and

obvious

reasons. This "multicollinearity in the independent

the level of

variables", as it is known

in

statistical parlance, should

not affect the level of the coefficients reported in table 2,

ior the strength of the overall correlation between height
arid its supposed determinants, but it

accuracy

might affect the

of predictions such as those shown in table 3.

Howcver, prediction of this kind outside the range of the
data -

for

example to earlier

periods - is

fraught with other

difficulties; the extent of multicollinearity is therefore
merely sri additional reason for care. Once again, it would be

desirable to see whether the addition of more data would
change the conclusions, as it might do if multicollinearity

wera.serjous problem.
Despite

these difficulties

and cautions, the results of

the regression analysis are striking. Western European
heights have responded entirely systematically, over the past
hundred years, to changes in income and disease, just as
heights in the modern world respond to similar differences
between countries. Economic development and the control of
disease have altered the bodies of the people of Europe.

Conclusion
The analysis inj2üs article has been conducted entirely
with data drawn from national populations. However, the
literature of humaibiology suggests very strongly that
similar methods of analysis could be employed to elucidate
differences in the rate of economic development within

nations, for example between one class and another or
between one area of the nation and another. In the

nineteenth century it was commonly thought that rural
populations were taller and stronger than urban populations,

while today the reverse is the case. Moreover, class
differentials in height have almost certainly narrowed over
the course of time. If it is possible for historians and

economists to collect, in many countries, evidence on
height changes specific to particular

classes,

occupations

and regions, then they have a powerful new method for the

description and analysis of the nature and extent of
economic development. Research of this kind is now being
conducted in Britain and

in

the United States; the analysis

of western European heights in this article is only

beginning which,
detailed

I hope, will

soon

a

be superseded by more

study of the history of European heights.
