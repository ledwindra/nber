The paper emphasizes the existence of several dimensions in which the recent literature provides a new perspective on the linkages among monetary policy, inflation, and the business cycle. It is argued that the adoption of an explicitly optimizing, general equilibrium framework has not been superfluous; on the contrary, it has yielded many insights which, by their nature, could hardly have been obtained with earlier non-optimizing models.\n\n",
