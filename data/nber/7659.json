    "abstract": "\n\nKaplan and Zingales [1997] provide both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence that investment-cash flow sensitivities are not good indicators of financing constraints.   Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen [1999] criticize those findings.  In this note, we explain how the Fazzari et al. [1999] criticisms are either very supportive of the claims in Kaplan and Zingales [1997] or incorrect.   We conclude with a discussion of unanswered questions.\n\n",
