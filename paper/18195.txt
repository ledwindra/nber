The Economics of Options-Implied Inflation Probability Density Functions

ABSTRACT
Recently a market in options based on CPI inflation (inflation caps and floors) has emerged in the
US. This paper uses quotes on these derivatives to construct probability densities for inflation. We
study how these pdfs respond to news announcements, and find that the implied odds of deflation are
sensitive to certain macroeconomic news releases. We compare the option-implied probability densities
with those obtained by time series methods, and use this information to construct empirical pricing
kernels. The options-implied densities assign considerably more mass to extreme inflation outcomes
(either deflation or high inflation) than do their time series counterparts. This yields a U-shaped empirical
pricing kernel, with investors having high marginal utility in states of the world characterized by either
deflation or high inflation.

Introduction

Fifteen years ago, the US Treasury began issuing index-linked debt. The spreads between the yields on these Treasury Inﬂation Protected Securities (TIPS) and the yields
on their nominal counterparts—known as inflation compensation or breakevens—have
become widely used as a real-time measure of investors’ inﬂation expectations. They
are commonly cited by Federal Reserve oﬃcials. A growing literature attempts to decompose these into inﬂation expectations, inﬂation risk premia and liquidity premia
(see, Gürkaynak, Sack and Wright (2010), Pﬂueger and Viceira (2011), Campbell,
Sunderam and Viceira (2010), Christensen, Lopez and Rudebusch (2010), D’Amico,
Kim and Wei (2010), Grishchenko and Huang (2012) among others). Subsequently
an over-the-counter market in inﬂation swaps emerged (Fleckenstein, Longstaﬀ and
Lustig (2010)). These are contracts where one party agrees to pay an interest rate
on a notional underlying principle that is ﬁxed at the start of the contract, while the
other party agrees to pay the realized inﬂation rate on that same notional principle.
Only the net of the two amounts actually changes hands. Under risk-neutrality, the
ﬁxed rate should equal expected inﬂation over the life of the contract.
Much more recently, a new market has emerged that is potentially considerably
more powerful in providing direct market-based measures of investors’ inﬂation beliefs.
It is the market for inﬂation caps and floors—option-like securities whose payoﬀ is
tied to the realized inﬂation rate. The market developed ﬁrst in the euro area and the
UK, but has expanded in the US during the last few years. This is no doubt in part
because of heightened investor concerns about the possibilities of deﬂation or of high

1

inﬂation in the wake of the ﬁnancial crisis. Unlike TIPS or inﬂation swaps, these new
inﬂation derivatives provide direct information about the whole probability density for
inﬂation, not just inﬂation expectations. This is naturally of great potential interest
to a forward-looking central bank with an inﬂation objective.
In this paper, we use prices of inﬂation ﬂoors and caps to form implied probability density functions (pdfs) for inﬂation at diﬀerent maturities, at the daily frequency
over the last 2-1/2 years. While the sample period is short, it is of course a period
of exceptional turbulence in the US economy and ﬁnancial markets.
Our emphasis is on the economic interpretation of these inﬂation pdfs. In an
event-study approach, we relate them to macroeconomic news announcements, ﬁnding
that certain news announcements signiﬁcantly impact the implied probabilities of
deﬂation, and of high inﬂation. We construct a measure of FOMC announcement-day
surprises and ﬁnd that these do not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on implied pdfs. However,
the inﬂation pdfs did change over the time period that the market expectations about
the second round of large scale asset purchases or LSAP-2 were formed in the fall of
2010.
These implied inﬂation pdfs are worked out under an assumption of risk-neutrality.
We can however compare the pdfs to the density forecasts that would be formed by an
econometrician. We ﬁnd that our option-implied pdfs put substantially more weight
on both high inﬂation and on deﬂation than their objective counterparts. That implies that the pricing kernel of investors is U-shaped in inﬂation, with investors having
high marginal utility in both the state of the world where inﬂation is high and in the
deﬂationary state.
2

The plan for the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the
inﬂation ﬂoors and caps, and the extraction of the implied pdfs. Section 3 is an
event-study analysis that relates these pdfs to certain news announcements. Section
4 compares the option-implied pdfs to econometric-based “physical” density forecasts,
in order to obtain an empirical pricing kernel. Section 5 contains some robustness
checks and extensions, while section 6 concludes.

Inflation Caps and Floors

Throughout this paper, we will work with zero-coupon inﬂation ﬂoors and caps; these
are analytically by far the most convenient forms of these securities to work with. A
zero-coupon inﬂation cap is a contract entered into at time t. The seller of the cap
promises to pay a fraction max((1 + π(n))n − (1 + k)n , 0) of a notional underlying
principle as a single payment in n years’ time, where π(n) denotes the average annual
CPI inﬂation rate1 from t to t + n, and k denotes the strike of the cap. Without loss
of generality, we normalize the notional underlying principle to $1. In exchange for
this, the buyer makes an up-front payment of Pt (k, n). The buyer receives collateral
to ensure that they will receive their payment at the end of the contract. Obviously,
if inﬂation ends up being lower than k, then the option expires out-of-the money and
ends up being worthless. A zero-coupon inﬂation ﬂoor is identical, except that the
payment is max((1 + k)n − (1 + π(n))n , 0).
The market for inﬂation ﬂoors and caps is still in its infancy. The nominal
Treasury market is far more liquid than the TIPS market, which is in turn more
1

liquid than the market for inﬂation swaps, and that is in turn more liquid than the
market for inﬂation ﬂoors and caps. Still, according to a dealer, about $22 billion
of notional principle was traded in the inter-dealer market in 2011, which represents
an increase of around 200% from 2010. Economists have a strong presumption that
the prices that individuals are willing to pay reﬂect their beliefs, even when the
stakes may not be that high. In experimental game theory, it is common to study
individuals’ behavior when tiny sums are at stake. Prediction markets are a good
example of cases in which the stakes are small, but there is strong evidence that prices
are nonetheless quite informative (Wolfers and Zitzewitz (2004)). The dollar trading
volumes in inﬂation derivatives are minuscule relative to the Treasury market, but
still big enough to presumably reﬂect the beliefs of traders in this market, and far
bigger than those in experimental games and in prediction markets.
It is hard to know who are the participants in the market for inﬂation ﬂoors and
caps. However, based on SEC ﬁlings, we can see that mutual funds and insurance
companies participate in this market. They both buy and sell protection against both
inﬂation and deﬂation. For example, PIMCO has written a substantial amount of
inﬂation ﬂoors.
We obtained daily quotes on zero-coupon inﬂation caps at strike prices of 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 and 6 percent, and on zero-coupon inﬂation ﬂoors at strike prices of -2, -1,
0, 1, 2 and 3 percent.2 The maturities are 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. The data were
kindly provided to us by BGC Partners. The sample period is from October 6, 2009
2
Anecdotal reports suggest that the most actively traded ﬂoors and caps are currently those at
0 and 5 percent strikes, respectively.

4

to March 27, 2012.
We use these quotes to form implied pdfs for inﬂation, but without assuming
normality, as it is especially useful to have measures of investors’ perceptions of tail
outcomes. Our approach to forming the implied pdfs is a simple one based on the
methodology of Breeden and Litzenberger (1979). Let us suppose that inﬂation over
the next n years can be approximated as having only integer support. If we consider
a butterfly portfolio that involves buying caps with strikes of k − 1 percent and k + 1
percent while shorting two caps with a strike of k percent, then this is a pure ArrowDebreu security with a payoﬀ of $1 if inﬂation is k percent and zero otherwise, for
any integer k. Let pk,n denote the probability that π(n) = k. A risk-neutral investor
will pay e−rn n pk,n for this Arrow-Debreu security, where rn denotes the continuouslycompounded interest rate for n years. As the ﬁnal payment is secured by collateral,
we wanted to use a risk-free rate for discounting, and so discount by the nominal
Treasury term structure, using the dataset of Gürkaynak, Sack and Wright (2007).
This mechanically gives us the risk-neutral probabilities of inﬂation being -2, -1,
0, ....5 percent. As for the tails, if an investor buys an inﬂation cap at 5 percent and
shorts one at 6 percent, then this investor receives $1 if inﬂation is 6 percent or more
and zero otherwise. This gives the probability of inﬂation being 6 percent or higher.
The same works in the left tail as well, yielding the probability of inﬂation being
-2 percent or lower. Thus we have essentially the whole term structure of inﬂation
pdfs.3
3
There also exist year-over-year inﬂation ﬂoors and caps, securities in which the payment is
based on the diﬀerence between the strike price and actual inﬂation in each year over the life of
the contract. It is possible to use these to form implied inﬂation pdfs (Mercurio (2005), Mercurio

5

Figures 1 and 2 show the resulting pdfs at all the available maturities on two
sample days—June 10, 2010 and February 28, 2011, respectively. The implied pdf in
June 2010 put substantial odds on deﬂation over the medium term, and was clearly
skewed to the left.

This is likely in part at least indicative of the concerns about

further disinﬂation that prompted the Fed to introduce LSAP-2 (also sometimes referred to as QE2) later in that year. In contrast, in February 2011, the implied pdf
was more symmetric, and indeed appeared to be approximately normal. The implied
pdfs shown in Figures 1 and 2 both exhibit quite high variance. For example, the
implied standard deviation of average inﬂation over the next ten years is about 1.5
percentage points in both ﬁgures. That seems high, though of course concerns about
inﬂation becoming unanchored, in either direction, have been elevated over this period. It is important to remember that these implied pdfs are based on an assumption
that agents are risk neutral. More about this in section 4.
As another way to report evolving perceptions of inﬂation risk that does not
focus on two arbitrarily chosen days, we can plot the probability of deﬂation (deﬁned
here as inﬂation falling to 0 percent and below) against time (Figure 3) and the
probability of high inﬂation (deﬁned as inﬂation rising to 4 percent and above) against
time (Figure 4). At the one-year horizon, the implied probability of deﬂation was
high in 2010 and fell in 2011.

The odds of deﬂation at longer horizons rose in late

2010 and again in late 2011, which were both times of considerable concern about
the durability of the economic recovery in the wake of ongoing ﬁnancial turmoil. The
odds of high inﬂation rose at all horizons in late 2010 and early 2011, before dropping
and Moreni (2006), Kruse (2011)), but it is much harder. Meanwhile, our focus in this paper is not
on the mechanics of extracting the risk-neutral inﬂation pdfs per se, but rather on their economic
interpretation.

2.1

The Embedded Deflation Option in TIPS

A diﬀerent source of information about inﬂation risks is available from TIPS. TIPS
bonds have the property that the principal repayment cannot be less than the face
value of the bond, even if the price level falls over the life of the bond. This gives TIPS
an option-like feature in which the “strike price” is the reference CPI (the price level
at the time that the bond is issued). For a newly issued bond, any deﬂation will result
in this option being in the money. For a bond issued, say, ﬁve years ago, however, the
deﬂation has to have been very severe—enough to unwind all the cumulative inﬂation
over the past ﬁve years—before this deﬂation option has any value. Thus comparing
the real yields on pairs of TIPS with comparable maturity dates but diﬀerent reference
CPIs contains information about the odds of deﬂation (again under risk-neutrality).
At times during recent years, these spreads such pairs of TIPS bonds traded at quite
diﬀerent yields, indicating substantial odds of deﬂation and/or a big deﬂation risk
premium. Authors that have used the embedded-option in TIPS to measure the
odds of deﬂation under risk neutrality include Wright (2009), Christensen, Lopez and
Rudebusch (2011) and Grishchenko, Vanden and Zhang (2011). The TIPS market
is more liquid than the market in inﬂation ﬂoors and caps. But the information on
inﬂation risks that can be gleaned from comparing TIPS is far more limited; it only
gives odds of deﬂation, not a complete pdf. And the comparison of TIPS yields could
be aﬀected by other factors, such as diﬀerences in liquidity across TIPS securities,
4

A “movie” showing the pdf at the ten-year horizon day-by-day is available at http://www.econ.
jhu.edu/People/Wright/inﬂationpdf.html.

7

and the fact that no two TIPS have exactly the same maturity date (so that the
comparison could be distorted by the seasonal pattern in CPI). Thus, in this paper,
we use inﬂation ﬂoors and caps rather than comparison of TIPS yields as they are a
much cleaner and more complete measure of investor perceptions of inﬂation risks.

Events that Move the Inflation PDFs

While asset prices ought to be related to economic fundamentals, the link between
the two is often frustratingly diﬃcult to uncover. But the high-frequency reaction
of asset prices to macroeconomic news announcements can represent a rich source of
information about the relationship between ﬁnancial asset prices and our measures of
economic fundamentals. In a small window around a major news announcement, the
announcement swamps any other public or private information that becomes available, and so relating the surprise component of this announcement to the change in
asset prices is akin to a “natural experiment”. For example, it is notoriously hard
to relate exchange rates to any fundamentals. Nonetheless, Andersen, Bollerslev,
Diebold and Vega (2003) ﬁnd that in short intradaily windows around macroeconomic
news announcements, there is a systematic relationship between macroeconomic surprises and exchange rate changes.
Accordingly, we relate daily changes in our implied inﬂation pdfs to nine leading
macroeconomic announcements. Table 1 lists the announcements, their frequency
and release times. For all announcements other than the FOMC announcement, the
surprise component of each announcement is measured as the real-time actual value
less the median expectation from the survey conducted by Money Market Services
8

(MMS) on the previous Friday. For the FOMC announcement, we are faced with the
diﬃculty that this is the period at which the federal funds rate is stuck at the zero
bound—any properly measured monetary policy surprises based on the federal funds
would necessarily be identically equal to zero. But the FOMC announcements over
this period contain information about the expected duration of the zero interest rate
period and also about Fed asset purchases. As in Wright (2011), we quantify the
surprise components of these announcements by the ﬁrst principal component of the
intraday change in the yields on two-, ﬁve-, ten- and thirty-year Treasury futures from
15 minutes before the time of the FOMC announcement to 1 hour and 45 minutes
afterwards.5 It is hard to see how these jumps in yields owe to anything other than
the FOMC announcements.

The FOMC announcements that we consider include

both FOMC meetings and important speeches by FOMC members relating to the
outlook for monetary policy.
The event-study regressions that we run are of the form:
∆pk,n,t = ΣJj=1 βj sjt + εt

(1)

where ∆pk,n,t is the risk-neutral probability of deﬂation, or of inﬂation exceeding 4
percent over the next n years, as of day t, while sjt denotes the surprise component
of an announcement of type j. The regression is run over all days where there is at
least one news announcement: the surprise is set to zero for news types for which
there is not an announcement on that day. The device of regressing yield changes
on surprise components of all diﬀerent types of announcements jointly accommodates
5

These are normalized so that a drop in the level of interest rates around the FOMC corresponds
to a positive surprise.

9

the possibility of multiple announcements coming out concurrently.
The results are shown in Table 2 (for deﬂation) and Table 3 (for high inﬂation).
The probabilities are in percentage points, the macroeconomic surprises are in the
units listed in Table 1. For example, the eﬀect of a CPI surprise on the deﬂation
probability at the one-year horizon is reported as -10.94. This means that if CPI were
to come in a full percentage point above expectations (a very big surprise indeed),
then the implied the probability of negative CPI inﬂation over the next 12 months
would fall by 10.94 percentage points.6
For all of the macroeconomic surprises that we consider, a positive surprise
corresponds to higher-than-expected economic activity/inﬂation. It is not surprising
that most estimates in Table 2 are negative; surprises indicating more strength in
aggregate demand lower the perceived risk of deﬂation. At the one-year horizon,
CPI is the only macroeconomic surprise that has a signiﬁcant impact on deﬂation
risk—of course CPI surprises should mechanically have an eﬀect on deﬂation risk,
since inﬂation caps and ﬂoors are based on the CPI. At longer horizons, higher than
expected releases of existing home sales, nonfarm payrolls, PPI and retail sales all
signiﬁcantly lower the perceived odds of deﬂation. FOMC surprises do not have any
statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect on deﬂation risk. One of the channels through which unconventional monetary policy was intended to support the economy was by lowering
the risk of deﬂation. That eﬀect does not show up in the approach considered here, in
6

Strictly, an h-year inﬂation cap or ﬂoor refers to the h-year inﬂation rate starting about two
months before the start date of the contract. This indexation lag is familiar to inﬂation-related assets
and is necessitated by delays in compiling CPI data. But of course this means that a surprise in the
CPI index for the last month enters directly into the cap/ﬂoor payoﬀ and so should mechanically
have a big eﬀect on the pdf, especially at shorter horizons.

10

which we link derivative-based inﬂation probabilities and FOMC-day surprises constructed from Treasury futures. It should be noted, however, that the expectations
about unconventional monetary policy over our sample period were shaped not only
by FOMC announcements but also by other factors such as speeches by the Federal
Reserve oﬃcials and discussions in the media.7 Indeed, inﬂation probability distributions became more skewed toward higher inﬂation outcomes during the period from
late August to early November 2010, over which expectations for LSAP-2 were priced
in by investors. On the day of the actual LSAP-2 announcement, Nov. 3 of 2010,
deﬂation odds fell and probability of high inﬂation rose slightly.
Most of the estimates in Table 3 are positive; surprises indicating more strength
in aggregate demand raise the perceived risk of inﬂation exceeding 4 percent. The
eﬀects of CPI surprises on the perceived probability of high inﬂation at the one- and
three-year horizons are both statistically signiﬁcant. But, apart from existing home
sales, no other macroeconomic surprises have any signiﬁcant eﬀect on the odds of
high inﬂation at horizons below ten years.
Overall, there is a bit more evidence of deﬂation probabilities being sensitive
to macroeconomic news than for high inﬂation probabilities being sensitive to news,
at least at medium horizons (three to seven years). Perhaps this is a result that is
particular to the sample period. News about demand may have had a heightened
impact on investors’ perceptions of the odds of the economy becoming stuck in a
deﬂationary spiral, which would not be the case at a time when the economy was far
7
See, for example, a Bloomberg article of October 28, 2010, by Rebecca Christie and Craig
Torres for a snapshot of market expectations regarding additional monetary stimulus shortly before
the FOMC meeting of November 2010, at which the LSAP-2 was announced.

11

from the zero lower bound.
Table 4 lists the days of the ten biggest absolute changes in the options-implied
odds of deﬂation or high inﬂation at the ten-year horizon. For these days, we went
back and searched Wrightson ICAP daily summaries of ﬁnancial markets for news
stories that could help explain the change. The possible contributory factors that we
found are also listed in Table 4. There are some cases in which changes in optionimplied odds are consistent with news stories. For example, the ﬂuctuations in the
odds of deﬂation in October 2010 can be at least partially explained by shifting
speculation about the size of the LSAP-2 program that the FOMC was expected
to announce at its meeting on November 3 of that year. At the same time, most
substantial changes in the inﬂation pdfs occurred on days when it is hard to ﬁnd
news or an event that provides even a partial plausible explanation. It is however
a long-standing puzzle that news announcements can explain only a small share of
asset price variation, and indeed that the biggest asset price movements occur in the
absence of any apparent public information (Fair (2002)).
One might wonder if the announcement by the FOMC of a 2 percent long-run
goal for inﬂation on January 25, 2012 aﬀected these probability densities. They were
little changed on the day of the announcement, and indeed over several subsequent
days.

Inflation Risk Premia

The implied pdfs that we have obtained are based on the assumption of risk-neutrality.
In standard ﬁnance terminology, they are obtained under the Q measure. Agents are
12

presumably not risk neutral, and so the probabilities will diﬀer from a physical density
forecast (the P measure). As is well known, the risk-neutral probability of a particular
state of the world is equal to the physical probability times the pricing kernel, in that
state of the world. Outcomes in which the marginal utility of an investor is high
will be overweighted under the Q measure. The ratio of the estimated pdf under
the Q measure to that under the P measure represents the empirical pricing kernel
(Rosenberg and Engle (2002)).
We consider four diﬀerent time series approaches to form a physical density
forecast for inﬂation. These are:
1. The unobserved component stochastic volatility model (UCSV), which Stock and
Watson (2007) ﬁnd to provide good forecasts for inﬂation. The model is univariate.
Inﬂation is πt , which can be decomposed as:
πt = τt + σT,t ηtT
and
τt = τt−1 + σP,t ηtP
2
2
2
2
where (ηtT , ηtP )′ is iidN (0, I2 ), log(σT,t+1
) = log(σT,t
) + ψ1,t , log(σP,t+1
) = log(σP,t
)+

ψ2,t and (ψ1,t , ψ2,t )′ is iidN (0, γI2 ), with (ηtT , ηtP )′ and (ψ1,t , ψ2,t )′ being mutually
independent. The model can be ﬁtted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and
can be used to simulate a density forecast for inﬂation. Following Stock and Watson
(2007), the parameter γ is ﬁxed at 0.2.
2. The unobserved component stochastic volatility as in (1), except that the correlation between ηtT and ψ1,t is ρ1 and the correlation between ηtP and ψ2,t is ρ2 . This
13

introduces a leverage eﬀect. We refer to this as the UCSV model with correlated errors (UCSV-CE), and use the algorithm of Omori et al. (2007) to obtain the posterior
distribution of the parameters, which we then use to simulate a density forecast.8
3. An AR(4) model for inﬂation, with an EGARCH speciﬁcation for the errors. The
UCSV model allows the density forecasts to be fat-tailed, but restricts them to be
symmetric. The AR-EGARCH speciﬁcation loosens this restriction.
4. The VAR model with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility, proposed
by Primiceri (2005). The VAR uses real-time data on quarterly CPI inﬂation, the
federal funds rate and the unemployment rate. Following Primiceri, the speciﬁcation
has two lags and coeﬃcients that follow random walks, while the error terms exhibit
stochastic volatility. The VAR is constrained to be stationary in every period. We
evaluate the posterior distribution of the parameters, and then use this to simulate a
density forecast for inﬂation.
In Figure 1, we reported the options-implied pdfs for inﬂation, as of June 10, 2010.
Figures 5-8 plot the corresponding physical pdfs for inﬂation based on the UCSV,
UCSV-CE, AR-EGARCH and TVP-VAR models, respectively, using the CPI data
that were available as of that date.9 Figures 9-12 plot the ratio of the options-implied
to these physical pdfs, which represent estimates of the empirical pricing kernel.
The physical pdfs in Figure 5-8 assign low odds to tail outcomes, especially for
8

Note that our forecast density takes account of parameter uncertainty—we use draws of the
parameters from their posterior distribution. The priors for ρ1 and ρ2 are independent and uniform
on [-1,1].
9

These use CPI inﬂation data from the start of 1960 up to April 2010, the last available data on
June 10, 2010.

14

the AR-EGARCH speciﬁcation (Figure 6). Note that this is a stationary speciﬁcation.
The density forecast for average inﬂation over the horizon h that is implied by the
AR-EGARCH model converges by construction to a degenerate distribution equal
to the sample average of inﬂation in the limit as h goes to inﬁnity. This is not
true for any of the other models, which all allow for a slowly varying local mean of
inﬂation. The UCSV and TVP-VAR models both imply symmetric density forecasts,
by construction. That is not true for the UCSV-CE and AR-EGARCH models,
although their density forecasts show little sign of skewness.
For any of the four physical pdfs in Figures 5-8, the tail outcomes have lower
odds under the P measure than under the Q measure. The direct implication of this
is that the empirical pricing kernel is very high for both severe deﬂation outcomes
and for high inﬂation outcomes (Figures 9-12). The empirical pricing kernel is thus
generally U-shaped, although the relative marginal utilities in the deﬂationary and
inﬂationary tails depends on the method that is used to form the forecast under the
P measure.
These empirical pricing kernel results apply, of course, only to one day.

To

investigate the question over the rest of the sample period, we show the optionsimplied and physical probabilities of deﬂation over the whole sample (Figure 13)
and, likewise, the options-implied and physical probabilities of inﬂation exceeding 4
percent (Figure 14). The physical probabilities are obtained in both cases from the
UCSV model. The options-implied probabilities of deﬂation are consistently above
the physical probabilities. It’s perhaps a little less stark for the odds of high inﬂation.
However, the options-implied probabilities of high inﬂation are nearly always above
15

the physical probabilities, at horizons beyond one year.

So the U-shaped pricing

kernel does not apply to one day alone.
The U-shaped pricing kernel in turn has implications for the risk premia in
nominal bonds. We have found direct and model-free evidence that investors view
both high inﬂation and deﬂation as states of the world in which their marginal utility
is high. Consequently, assets that pay oﬀ in these scenarios are valuable hedges.
Nominal bonds are assets whose real value is eroded by high inﬂation, but which do
well in a deﬂationary environment. Until recently, deﬂation seemed a very remote
possibility, and so over the range of plausible inﬂation outcomes, investors would
have seen marginal utility as upward sloping, leading nominal bonds to command a
positive risk premium. But in the wake of the ﬁnancial crisis, there are substantial
odds of both high inﬂation and deﬂation, and that should make the risk premium on
nominal bonds be lower, or even negative. Using a quite diﬀerent approach Campbell,
Sunderam and Viceira (2010) argue that nominal bonds have recently switched from
being exposed to inﬂation risk (with positive term premia) to being deﬂation hedges
(with negative term premia), which is entirely consistent with what we ﬁnd in this
paper. A simple approach to estimating term premia is to take the diﬀerence between
long-term Treasury yields and average expected short-term interest rates measured
by the Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey. Term premia on ten-year Treasuries,
estimated in this way, are shown in Figure 15. They trended down from over 2 percent
in the late 1980s, to being slightly negative at the end of 2011.10 Given the U-shaped
10
Aﬃne term structure models (such as that of Kim and Wright (2005)) show term premia declining over the 1990s and 2000s. This trend has continued into the ﬁnancial crisis, and the term
premium estimates of Kim and Wright are now mildly negative.

16

pricing kernel, this would be consistent with investors shifting from being worried
about high inﬂation alone to being worried about both high inﬂation and deﬂation.

Robustness Checks and Extensions

We also investigated alternative methods for reverse-engineering probability density
functions from the prices of inﬂation ﬂoors and caps. One was to ﬁt a mixture of
two normals, picking the parameters so as to minimize the sum of squared percentage
pricing errors. The other was to use the nonparametric procedure of Shimko (1993).
Both of these gave similar probability density functions to those that we obtained in
section 3.
It would also be of interest to have a probability density for inﬂation over some
period in the future. Alas, the inﬂation ﬂoors and caps are all contracts that are
written on average inﬂation from the outset of the contract to the maturity date.
Assuming risk neutrality, we can back out the marginal densities of average inﬂation
over these horizons, but cannot extract the density for forward inﬂation without
making further assumptions. For example, with ﬁve- and ten-year ﬂoors and caps,
we can back out the marginal densities of inﬂation at ﬁve- and ten-year horizons, but
working out the probability density function for inﬂation from ﬁve to ten years’ hence
is a deconvolution problem that can only be solved if we make some assumption about
the dynamics of the inﬂation process, such as assuming that inﬂation in the ﬁrst ﬁve
and subsequent ﬁve years are mutually independent.
In Figure 16, we show the probability density functions for inﬂation from ﬁve to
ten years’ hence on four recent dates from December 2011 to April 2012, constructed
17

assuming that inﬂation over the ﬁrst ﬁve and subsequent ﬁve years are mutually
independent. These dates were chosen because they are the dates that the New York
Fed conducted surveys of primary dealers asking respondents for their judgmental
density forecasts for inﬂation from ﬁve to ten years’ hence.11 The survey density is
also included in Figure 16. Over this period, the survey density is virtually unchanged
from one date to the next, and the options-implied densities are very stable too.
Clearly, the options-implied densities assign much higher probabilities to both tails
than do the survey respondents. We interpret this as further evidence for the Ushaped empirical pricing kernel.

Conclusions

In this paper, we have used quotes on inﬂation caps and ﬂoors to construct riskneutral probability densities for inﬂation over the last 2-1/2 years. These pdfs do
not require an assumption of normality, and indeed on some occasions the pdfs were
skewed towards deﬂation. We have studied how these pdfs responded to certain
announcements. While most of the variation in inﬂation pdfs cannot be tied to
macroeconomic news announcements, the implied probability of deﬂation (and, to a
lesser extent, the implied probability of high inﬂation) are both signiﬁcantly related
to the surprise components of certain macroeconomic news announcements. The pdfs
that we have obtained are formed under an assumption of risk neutrality. Comparing
11

Respondents are asked to assign probabilities to average inﬂation being less than 1 percent, 1-1.5, 1.5-2, 2-2.5, 2.5-3 or over 3 percent. The probabilities are then averaged over the
21 respondents. Aggregate survey results used in this study are publicly available at http :
//www.newyorkf ed.org/markets/primarydealer survey questions.html.

18

them to econometric density forecasts allows us to see how investors marginal utility
relates to inﬂation. We ﬁnd that states of the world in which inﬂation is either very
low or very high are ones in which investors have high marginal utility.

Notes: This shows the time series of probabilities of average CPI inflation over selected horizons being
negative. These are constructed both (a) using inflation caps and floors, under an assumption of risk-neutrality
(blue solid line) and (b) from the UCSV model (red dashed line).

Notes: The blue curves show the pdfs for average CPI inflation from five to ten years hence derived from
inflation floors and caps under an assumption of risk neutrality. The densities were obtained assuming that
inflation over the first five and subsequent five years are independent mixed normal random variables. The
red curves show the corresponding pdfs from the New York Feds survey of primary dealers. The pdfs are
shown for all dates on which there is publicly available information for the New York Fed survey.
