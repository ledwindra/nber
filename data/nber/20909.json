    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper, we estimate the effect of primary school teachers\u2019 gender biases on boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 academic achievements during middle and high school and on the choice of advanced level courses in math and sciences during high school. For identification, we rely on the random assignments of teachers and students to classes in primary schools. Our results suggest that teachers\u2019 biases favoring boys have an asymmetric effect by gender\u2014 positive effect on boys\u2019 achievements and negative effect on girls\u2019. Such gender biases also impact students\u2019 enrollment in advanced level math courses in high school\u2014boys positively and girls negatively. These results suggest that teachers\u2019 biased behavior at early stage of schooling have long run implications for occupational choices and earnings at adulthood, because enrollment in advanced courses in math and science in high school is a prerequisite for post-secondary schooling in engineering, computer science and so on. This impact is heterogeneous, being larger for children from families where the father is more educated than the mother and larger on girls from low socioeconomic background.\n\n",
