    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose and initiate the study of privacy elasticity\u2014the responsiveness of economic variables to small changes in the level of privacy given to participants in an economic system. Individuals rarely experience either full privacy or a complete lack of privacy; we use differential privacy\u2014a computer-science theory increasingly adopted by industry and government\u2014as a standardized means of quantifying continuous privacy changes. The resulting privacy measure implies a privacy-elasticity notion that is portable and comparable across contexts. We discuss applications, and demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by estimating the privacy elasticity of public-good contributions in a lab experiment.\n\n",
