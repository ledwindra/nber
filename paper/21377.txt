Growth and Trade with Frictions: A Structural Estimation Framework

                                            ABSTRACT

We build and estimate a structural dynamic general equilibrium model of growth and trade. Trade
affects growth through changes in consumer and producer prices that in turn stimulate or impede physical
capital accumulation. At the same time, growth affects trade, directly through changes in country size
and indirectly through altering the incidence of trade costs. The model combines structural gravity
with a capital accumulation specification of the transition between steady states. Theory translates
into an intuitive econometric system that identifies the causal impact of trade on income and growth,
and also delivers estimates of the key structural parameters in our model. Counterfactual experiments
based on the estimated model give evidence for strong dynamic relationships between growth and
trade, resulting in doubling of the static gains from trade liberalization.

1      Introduction

The relationship of trade and growth has been a central concern of economists since Adam


Smith. Recent research raises doubts about an empirically strong relationship between trade

              1
and growth.       One solution is better models, but Head and Mayer (2014) review the theoret-


ical foundations of the best tting trade model (gravity) and note that the models are static.


This raises the econometric problem of how to handle the evolution of trade over time in


response to changes in trade costs.         (Head and Mayer, 2014, p.          189).   Similarly, Desmet


and Rossi-Hansberg (2014b) note that introducing dynamics to static multi-country trade


models adds considerable complexity because: (i) consumers care about the distribution of


their economic activities not only over countries, but also over time; and (ii) the clearance


of goods and factor markets is dicult, as prices depend on international trade.                      These


two diculties typically make spatial dynamic models intractable, both analytically and nu-


merically. (Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg, 2014b, p. 1212). In contrast policy analysts and


negotiating parties on both sides of trade mega deals such as the Transatlantic Trade and


Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union expect

                                                             2
that TTIP will result in more jobs and growth.                 Dissatisfaction with the gap between


researchers ndings and policymakers' expectations, the lack of strong empirical support


for a relationship between trade and growth, and the limitations of static gravity models


motivates our development of a dynamic model of trade and growth that allows structural


estimation.


    We embed an       N -country   Armington trade gravity model with its well-established good

    1 In order to motivate their famous paper, Frankel and Romer (1999) note that [d]espite the great eort
that has been devoted to studying the issue, there is little persuasive evidence concerning the eect of trade
on income. Similarly, Baldwin (2000) conrms that [t]he relationships between trade and growth have long
been a subject of [study and] controversy among economists. This situation continues today.

t properties into a dynamic capital accumulation model. The combination quanties the


relationship between trade policy (or other) changes and growth eects in a trading world of


many countries, asymmetric in size, bilateral trade frictions and capital accumulation. Our


dynamic structural growth-and-trade model is a member of the family of new quantitative


trade models, such as Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) (as

                                                                                                  3
summarized in       Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare, 2014), to which we add dynamics.


    We also contribute to two notable eorts to introduce dynamics within a heterogeneous


spatial framework. First, Krusell and Smith, Jr. (1998) show that in macroeconomic models


with heterogeneity features, aggregate variables (i.e. consumption, capital stock, and relative


prices) can be approximated very well as a function of the mean of the wealth distribution


and an aggregate productivity shock. Second, Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg (2014b) deliver


a tractable dynamic framework, where the rm's dynamic decision to innovate reduces to


a sequence of static prot-maximization problems, by imposing structure that disciplines

                                                                                                  4
the mobility of labor, land-ownership by the rm, and the diusion of technology.                     Similar


to Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg (2014b), we oer an analytical solution to the consumer's


dynamic decision to invest by imposing structure on the accumulation of capital in our model.


Added tractability comes from gravity structure that consistently aggregates bilateral trade


frictions for each country into multilateral resistance indexes. This second feature is similar


to Krusell and Smith, Jr. (1998), but replaces an approximation with an ideal index based


on the structure of the system.


    Two frictions take center stage in our model: costly trade and costly capital adjustment.

   3 In doing so, we extend on an earlier literature (i.e. Acemoglu and Zilibotti, 2001; Acemoglu and Ventura,
2002; Alvarez and Lucas, Jr., 2007), and we complement some new inuential papers (i.e. Sampson, 2014;
Eaton, Kortum, Neiman, and Romalis, 2015) that study the dynamics of trade. These studies calibrate their
models in arguably more complex environments.       In contrast, we deliver a structural econometric system
that allows us to test and establish causal relationships between trade, income, and growth and delivers the
key parameters that we employ in our counterfactual analysis. The price of this estimatability is a focus on
capital accumulation as the single channel for transmitting dynamic eects along with convenient functional
form assumptions,
   4 The usefulness of this approach is shown by Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg (2014a) who apply it to study
the geographic impact of climate change, and Desmet, Nagy, and Rossi-Hansberg (2015) who develop a
dynamic spatial growth theory with realistic geography to study the eects of relaxing migration restrictions
and the eects of a rise in the sea level.




                                                      2
The structural gravity model features bilaterally varying iceberg trade frictions and aggre-


gates their eect on productivity into multilateral resistance measures. Small scale simulation


models based on structural gravity combine trade cost estimates with simple general equi-


librium superstructure (e.g. Eaton and Kortum, 2002; Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003) to


provide intuitive and revealing counterfactual general equilibrium comparative statics. We


introduce capital accumulation on the transition between steady states to this setting. A


tractable accumulation model embedding structural gravity is based on Lucas and Prescott


(1971). The costs in adjustment of the capital stock acts essentially like iceberg trade fric-


tions (home bias) but on the inter-temporal rather than international margin. This similarity


translates the dynamic structural gravity model into a log-linear econometric system that


is easy to estimate. The estimating equations test and our results establish the causal im-


pact of trade on income and growth and deliver all the key structural parameters needed

                            5
to calibrate the model.         Counterfactual comparative static exercises with the estimated


model decompose and quantify the various channels through which trade aects growth and


through which growth impacts trade.             The results are evidence for strong dynamic links


between growth and trade.


    The structural gravity setup of Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) based on constant


elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences dierentiated by place of origin (Armington,

                                                              6
1969) forms the trade module of the static model.                 Recent work by Arkolakis, Costinot,


and Rodríguez-Clare (2012, henceforth also ACR) shows that gains from trade are invariant


to the introduction of monopolistic competition, entry of rms and selection into markets.

   5 The internal consistency of parameter estimates with the data basis of counterfactual exercises is a
key advantage of our approach: we test for the hypothesized link's signicance and use reasonably precise
point estimates to quantify the links in simulations. Our system delivers estimates of the trade elasticity
of substitution, of the capital (labor) share in production, of the capital depreciation rate, and of bilateral
trade costs which are all comparable to corresponding values from the existing literature.
   6 The gravity model is the workhorse in international trade. Anderson (1979) is the rst to build a gravity
theory of trade based on CES preferences with products dierentiated by place of origin. Bergstrand (1985)
embeds this setup in a monopolistic competition framework.        More recently, Eaton and Kortum (2002),
Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein (2008), and Chaney (2008) derived structural gravity based on selection
(hence substitution on the extensive margin) in a Ricardian framework. Thus, as noted by Eaton and Kortum
(2002) and Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodríguez-Clare (2012), a large class of models generate isomorphic
gravity equations. Anderson (2011) summarizes the alternative theoretical foundations of economic gravity.




                                                      3
The simple Armington/CES version of structural gravity exposited here thus stands in for a


more general class of models for which the information demands boil down to a single trade


elasticity. This class of models readily integrates with our model of capital accumulation.


Capital itself is an alternative use of the consumable bundle. In the steady state, the accu-


mulation ow osets depreciation, essentially equivalent to a composite intermediate good.


In this sense the model is isomorphic to Eaton and Kortum (2002) but with substitution on


the intensive margin. An extension to incorporate intermediate goods of the standard type


following Eaton and Kortum (2002) conrms that qualitative properties remain the same


while quantitative results shift signicantly.


    Growth through capital accumulation on the transition path is modeled in the spirit of


the dynamic general equilibrium models developed by Lucas and Prescott (1971) and Her-


cowitz and Sampson (1991). Their log-linear utility and log-linear capital transition function


structure yields a closed-form solution for optimal accumulation by innitely lived represen-

                                             7
tative agents with perfect foresight.            The closed-form accumulation solution is the bridge


to structural estimation and our exploration of the complex relationship between growth

             8
and trade.       We abstract from non-zero steady state growth for simplicity. While we also


abstract from endogenous technological change, note that changes in multilateral resistance


(also interpreted as input buyers' and sellers' incidence of trade costs) are eectively a type


of endogenous technological change.


    Trade's eect on growth acts in the model through a relative price channel. Trade cost


changes shift producer prices relative to consumer prices. More subtly, when trade is costly,


trade volume changes also induce shifts in producer relative to consumer prices.                           Shifts

   7 More recently, the log-linear capital transition function was for example used by Eckstein, Foulides, and
Kollintzas (1996) to synthesize exogenous and endogenous sources of economic growth, by Kocherlakota and
Yi (1997) to investigate whether permanent changes in government policies have permanent eects on growth
rates, and by Abel (2003) to investigate the eects of a baby boom on stock prices and capital accumulation.
   8 In contrast, no closed-form solution is available for models in the spirit of the dynamic, stochastic, general
equilibrium (DSGE) open economy macroeconomics literature, such as Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992,
1994).   In our robustness analysis we experiment with alternative specications for capital accumulation.
While these do not lead to the convenient and tractable closed-form solution from our main analysis, they
do generate qualitatively identical and quantitatively similar results.

in relative prices aect accumulation, and accumulation aects next period trade. Higher


producer prices increase accumulation because they imply higher returns to investment,


hence agents lower current consumption in return for expected increased future consumption.


Higher investment and consumer prices, in contrast, reduce accumulation due to higher costs


of investment and due to higher opportunity costs of consumption. Importantly, due to the


general equilibrium forces in our model, changes in trade costs or trade volumes between any


two trading partners potentially aect producer prices and consumer prices in any nation in


the world. In the empirical results, such third-party eects are signicant.


   Growth aects trade via two channels, direct and indirect. The direct eect of growth


on trade is strictly positive, acting through country size.   Growth in one economy results


in more exports and in more imports between the growing country and all of its trading


partners.   The indirect eect of growth on trade arises because changes in country size


translate into changes in the multilateral resistance for all countries, with knock on changes


in trade ows. Importantly, the indirect channel through which growth aects trade is also


a general equilibrium one, i.e., growth in one country aects trade costs and impacts welfare


in every other country in the world. Work done on other data (e.g. Anderson and Yotov,


2010; Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003) reveals that a higher income is strongly associated


with lower sellers' incidence of trade costs and thus a real income increase, a correlation


replicated here. Closing the loop, growth-led changes in the incidence of trade costs leads to


additional changes in capital stock.


   We implement the dynamic structural gravity model on a sample of 82 countries over


the period 19902011. First, we translate the model into a structural econometric system


that oers a theoretical foundation to and expands the famous reduced-form specication of


Frankel and Romer (1999). Similar to Frankel and Romer (1999), we identify a signicant


causal eect of trade on income. In addition, we complement the trade-and-income system


of Frankel and Romer with a structural equation that captures the eects of trade on cap-


ital accumulation. The estimation of our structural system yields estimates of trade costs,




                                              5
multilateral resistance terms as well as of all besides one model parameters.


    We then combine the newly constructed trade costs with data on the rest of the variables


in our model to perform a series of counterfactual experiments to quantify and decompose


the relationships between growth and trade.               These experiments reveal that the dynamic

                                                                                              9
eects of trade liberalization lead to doubling in the corresponding static eects.               The dy-


namic channels in our framework (increased country size and changes in the multilateral


resistances) imply that preferential trade liberalization (e.g. a Regional Trade Agreement,


RTA) may benet non-members eventually, despite the initial negative eect of trade diver-


sion. RTAs that are statically benecial to members stimulate growth by making investment


more attractive. This will normally lead to lower sellers' incidence for these countries, but


also to lower buyers' incidence in non-members. Furthermore, the increased income in mem-


ber countries will translate into an increase of imports from all trading partners, including


non-members. Consistent with that logic, our simulation of the North American Free Trade


Agreement (NAFTA) shows that its formation had small and non-monotonic negative trade


eects on non-member countries and even some small net trade-creation eects for several


non-members (e.g. the Netherlands). A battery of sensitivity checks conrms the robustness


of our results.


    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present our contributions


in relation to existing studies. Section 3 develops the theoretical foundation and discusses


the structural links between growth and trade in our model. In Section 4, we translate our


theoretical framework into an econometric model. Section 5 oers counterfactual experiments


and a summary of the results from a series of sensitivity analysis. Detailed description of


the robustness experiments can be found in the Appendix. Section 6 concludes with some


suggestions for future research. All derivations and technical discussions are included in an


Online Appendix.

   9 Similarly, in a dynamic setting with heterogeneous rms, Sampson (2014) nds that the eects of trade
liberalization triple as compared to the static counterpart.

2       Relation to Literature


Our work contributes to several inuential strands of the literature. First, our paper builds


a bridge between the empirical and theoretical literatures on the links between growth and


trade. The seminal work of Frankel and Romer (1999) uses a reduced-form framework to

                                                            10
study the relationships between income and trade.                Wacziarg (2001) investigates the links


between trade policy and economic growth employing a panel of 57 countries for the period


of 1970 to 1989. A key nding is that physical capital accumulation accounts for about 60%


of the total positive impact of openness on economic growth. Baldwin and Seghezza (2008)


and Wacziarg and Welch (2008) conrm these ndings for up to 39 countries for two years


(1965 and 1989) and a set of 118 countries over the period 1950 to 1998, respectively. Cuñat


and Maezzoli (2007) demonstrate the role of factor accumulation to reproduce the large


observed increases in trade shares after modest tari reductions.               These studies motivate

                                                                                     11
our focus on capital accumulation as the source of growth in our model.                   We extend this


reduced form literature in two ways. First, we oer structural equations that corresponds


directly to the reduced-form specication of Frankel and Romer (1999). Second, we introduce


a theoretically-motivated equation that captures the eects of trade on capital accumulation


and hence growth.


     On the structural trade-and-growth side, our paper is related to a series of inuential


papers by Jonathan Eaton and Samuel Kortum (see Eaton and Kortum, 2001, 2002, 2005),


who study the links between trade, production and growth via technological spill-overs. We


abstract from the random productivity draws setup of Eaton and Kortum (EK) for simplicity,


since the EK model is observationally equivalent to the structural gravity model we estimate.


This simplicity allows our addition of capital accumulation in transition. The steady state

    10 In order to account for the endogeneity problems that plague the relationships between growth and
trade, Frankel and Romer (1999) draw from the early, a-theoretical gravity literature (see Tinbergen, 1962;
Linnemann, 1966) and propose to instrument for trade ows with geographical characteristics and country
size.
    11 The correlation in our sample between changes in trade openness (measured as exports plus imports as
share of gross domestic product) and changes in capital accumulation is about 0.38 (p-value 0.002).




                                                     7
of our model is equivalent to EK if we add a ow use of intermediate goods to the ow of

                                   12
capital to oset depreciation.


    While the relationships between growth and trade are of central interest in this paper and


in Eaton and Kortum's work, we view our study as complementary to Eaton and Kortum's


agenda because the dynamic relationships between trade and production in our model are

                                           13
generated via capital accumulation.


    We also contribute to the literature on the eects of RTAs with a framework to study their


dynamic eects.     Three results stand out. First, we nd that the dynamic eects of RTAs are


strong for member countries and relatively week for outsiders. Second, in terms of duration,


we nd that the dynamic eects of RTAs on members are long-lasting, while the dynamic


eects on outsiders are short-lived. Finally, our NAFTA counterfactual experiment reveals


the possibility for non-monotonic eects of preferential trade liberalization on non-member


countries. As discussed earlier, the reason is a combination of the trade-driven growth of


member countries and the fact that the falling incidence of trade costs for the producers in


the growing member economies is shared with buyers in outside countries. These ndings

  12 The work of Eaton and Kortum that is most closely related to our study is thoroughly summarized in
their manuscript Eaton and Kortum (2005). In chapter ten, based on Eaton and Kortum (2001), they study
how trade in capital goods possibly transmits technological advances. The analysis is based on a model with
two goods, a capital good and a consumption good, in an environment of perfect competition in the output
market, the labor market, and the rental market for capital. The main nding is that dierences in equipment
prices can be related to dierences in productivity and barriers to trade in equipment. In chapter eleven,
they investigate the geographical scope of technological progress in a multi-country (semi)endogenous growth
framework. The main empirical nding is that an innovation abroad is two-thirds as potent as a domestic
innovation. For a thorough review of the theoretical literature on trade and (endogenous) technology up to
the 1990s, we refer the reader to Grossman and Helpman (1995). For more recent developments in the related
literature, we refer the reader to Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001), Acemoglu and Ventura (2002), Alvarez and
Lucas, Jr. (2007), Sampson (2014), and Eaton, Kortum, Neiman, and Romalis (2015).
  13 Even though technology is exogenous in our model, our framework has implications for TFP calculations
and estimations. In particular, the introduction of a structural trade costs term in the production function
reveals potential biases in the existing estimates of technology. In addition, our model can be used to simulate
the eects of exogenous technological changes.
  Our choice is consistent with the theoretical developments of Grossman and Helpman (1991) and is mo-
tivated by the empirical ndings of Wacziarg (2001), Cuñat and Maezzoli (2007), Baldwin and Seghezza
(2008) and Wacziarg and Welch (2008). On the theoretical side, Grossman and Helpman (1991) develop a
series of growth and trade models, where they endogenize the creation of new products and allow for tech-
nology diusion in a dynamic multi-country model. As mentioned in footnote 17 on page 132 in Grossman
and Helpman (1991), transitional dynamics naturally arise when allowing for capital accumulation and that
physical capital may play only a supporting role in the story of long-run growth. (p. 122). This is exactly
the focus of our study, where we model and quantify the transitional growth eects of trade liberalization.

     A useful by-product of our model is a direct estimate of the trade elasticity of substitution,


which has gained recent popularity as the single most important trade parameter (see ACR).


The estimator is due to a structural trade term in the production function of our model.


With values between 5.1 and 8.0 from alternative specications and robustness experiments,


our estimates of the trade elasticity of substitution are comparable to the ones from the

                                                                   14
existing literature, which usually vary between 2 and 12.


     In broader context, using the gravity model as a vehicle to study the empirical relation-


ships between growth and trade is pointed as an important direction for future research by


Head and Mayer (2014).          On the theoretical side, we extend the family of static gravity


models that were stimulated by Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Anderson and van Wincoop

                                                                                    15
(2003) by a structural dynamic model of trade, production and growth.                    On the empirical


side, we complement Olivero and Yotov (2012) and Campbell (2010), who build estimat-


ing dynamic gravity equations, by testing and establishing the causal relationships between

                                16
trade, income, and growth.




3       Theoretical Foundation

The theoretical foundation used here to quantify the relationships between growth and trade


combines the static structural trade gravity setup of Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) with


dynamically endogenous production and capital accumulation in the spirit of the dynamic


general equilibrium models developed by Lucas and Prescott (1971) and Hercowitz and


Sampson (1991).       Goods are dierentiated by place of origin and each of the             N   countries

    16 There is a literature that explains export dynamics (see for example Das, Roberts, and Tybout, 2007;
Morales, Sheu, and Zahler, 2015) and one that focuses on adjustment dynamics and business cycle eects of
trade liberalization (see for example Artuç, Chaudhuri, and McLaren, 2010; Cacciatore, 2014; Dix-Carneiro,
2014). Export dynamics and adjustment and business cycle dynamics are beyond the scope of this paper.

where    pj,t   denotes the factory-gate price of good (country)                          j   at time     t   and   Aj,t   denotes


technology in country               j    at time   t. Lj,t   is the inelastically supplied amount of labor in


country     j   at time   t   and   Kj,t    is the stock of capital in     j   at   t.   Capital and labor are country-


specic (internationally immobile), and capital accumulates according to a Cobb-Douglas


transition function following Lucas and Prescott (1971) and Hercowitz and Sampson (1991):

                                                                     1−δ

preciation rate. This transition function reects the costs in adjustments of the volume of

           17
capital.


      Representative agents in each country work, invest and consume. Consumer preferences


are identical and represented by a logarithmic utility function with a subjective discount fac-


tor   β ∈ (0, 1).   At every point in time consumers in country                      j   choose aggregate consumption


(Cj,t ) and aggregate investment (Ωj,t ) to maximize the present discounted value of lifetime


utility subject to a sequence of constraints:

  17 Alternatively, one could view it as incorporating diminishing returns in research activity or as quality
dierences between old capital as compared to new investment goods. Note that this formulation does not
allow for zero investment       Ω       in any period, as this would render the capital stock and output to be zero.
Further, in the long-run steady-state,           K = Ω,   i.e., the specic transition function implies full depreciation.
Despite these limitations, we prefer this capital accumulation function over the more standard linear capital
accumulation function for our main analysis. The benets of that are: (i) a tractable closed-form solution of
our theoretical model; and (ii) a self-sucient structural system that is straightforward to estimate. In our
sensitivity analysis, we experiment with the linear capital accumulation function. Even though this function
no longer allows for a closed-form solution and requires the use of external calibrated parameters, we do nd
qualitatively identical and quantitatively similar results.

subject to the same CES aggregation is very convenient analytically. In addition, it is also consistent with
our aggregate approach in this paper.               Allowing for heterogeneity in preferences and prices between and
within consumption and investment goods will open additional channels for the interaction between trade
and growth which require sectoral treatment. This is beyond the scope of this paper, and we refer the reader

metaphor; it is as if goods melt away in distribution so that 1 unit shipped becomes                                                1/tij,t < 1

   We solve the consumers' optimization problem in two steps. First, we obtain the optimal


demand of       cij,t   and    Iij,t ,   for given     Cj,t , Ωj,t ,      and        yj,t .   We label this stage the `lower level'.

   Equation (12) links intuitively bilateral exports to market size (the rst term on the


right-hand side) and trade frictions (the second term on the right-hand side).                      Coined by

                                                        Pj,t   are the multilateral resistance terms


(MRs, outward and inward, respectively), which consistently aggregate bilateral trade costs


and decompose their incidence on the producers and the consumers in each region (Anderson


and Yotov, 2010). The multilateral resistances are key to our analysis because they represent


the endogenous structural link between the `lower level' trade analysis and the `upper level'


production and growth equilibrium. The MRs translate changes in bilateral trade costs at the


`lower level' into changes in factory-gate prices, which stimulate or discourage investment and


growth at the `upper level'. At the same time, by changing output shares in the multilateral


resistances, capital accumulation and growth alter the incidence of trade costs in the world.


   To solve the `upper level' dynamic optimization problem for              Cj,t   and   Ωj,t ,   we adapt the


methods of Hercowitz and Sampson (1991).            As discussed in detail in Heer and Mauÿner


(2009, chapter 1), this specic set-up with logarithmic utility and log-linear adjustment


costs has the advantage of delivering an analytical solution. To solve for the policy functions


of capital we iterate over the value function to obtain (see for details Online Appendix B):

   Policy function (15) is consistent with rational expectations despite the appearance of one


period ahead prices only. This is due to the log-linear functional form of both preferences and


capital accumulation, implying that marginal rates of substitution are proportional to the

ratio of present to one-period-ahead consumption or capital stocks.                       Alongside parameters,


capital stock in period       t+1 is determined as a function of the prices of domestically produced
goods   pj,t ,   technology   Aj,t ,   labor endowments    Lj,t ,   the current capital stock        Kj,t ,   and the


aggregate consumer price index across all products in the world                  Pj,t .
    As expected, (15) depicts the direct relationship between capital accumulation and the


levels of technology, labor endowment, and current capital stock. More important for the


purposes of this paper, (15) suggests a direct relationship between capital accumulation and


the prices of domestically produced goods and an inverse relationship between capital accu-


mulation and the aggregate consumer price index                 Pj,t .20   The intuition behind the positive


relationship between the prices of domestic goods and capital accumulation is that, all else


equal, when faced with higher returns to investment given by the value marginal product


of capital   αpj,t Aj,t L1−α  α−1
                         j,t Kj,t ,     consumers are willing to give up more of their current income


in order to increase future consumption. The intuition behind the negative relationship be-


tween capital accumulation and aggregate consumer prices is that an increase in                         Pj,t   means


that consumption as well as investment become more expensive. Hence, a higher share of


income will be spent on consumption today and less will be saved and transferred for future


consumption via capital accumulation.


    The relationships between prices and capital accumulation are crucial for understanding


the relationships between growth and trade because changes in trade costs will result in


changes in international prices, which will aect capital accumulation.                        Specically, the


inward multilateral resistance dened in equation (13) consistently aggregates the changes


in bilateral trade costs between any possibly pair of countries in the world for a given

  19 In Online Appendix C we conrm that our results are replicated by the standard dynamic rational
expectations solution method Dynare (Adjemian, Bastani, Juillard, Karamé, Maih, Mihoubi, Perendia,
Pfeifer, Ratto, and Villemot, 2011, http://www.dynare.org/). We also use Dynare to solve our model when
we allow for the standard linear capital accumulation function in order to demonstrate the robustness of our
ndings. This analysis is presented in Appendix A.2, Linear Capital Accumulation.
  20 It should be noted that the price of domestic goods enters the aggregate price index and, via this
channel, it has a negative eect on capital accumulation. However, as long as country          j   consumes at least
some foreign goods, this negative eect will be dominated by the direct positive eect of domestic prices on
capital accumulation.

economy.         Thus, intuitively, if a country liberalizes its inward MR falls and this triggers


investment. However, if liberalization takes place in the rest of the world this will result in


an increase in the MRs for outsiders, and therefore lower investment. Equation (15) reveals a


direct relationship between factory-gate prices and investment. Similar to the inward MRs,


factory-gate prices consistently aggregate the eects of changes in bilateral trade costs in


the world on investment decisions in a given country. The intuition is that when a country


opens up to trade producers from this country enjoy lower outward MR, which, according


to equation (11), translates into higher factory-gate prices. Outsiders face higher outward


MR, their factory-gate prices fall, and investment decreases.


   Given the policy function for capital, we can easily calculate investment,                  Ωj,t ,   consump-


tion,   Cj,t ,   and income, respectively, as (see for details Online Appendix B):

   System (16)-(18) reveals that aggregate consumption and aggregate investment at the


`upper level' are linked to the `lower level' via the consumer price indexes and factory-gate


prices, which consistently aggregate all bilateral trade links for consumers and investors,


respectively. In addition, the right-hand side expressions in the rst two equations reveal


that investment and consumption in each period are always a constant fraction of real gross


domestic product (GDP). This is due to the log-linear functional form of capital accumulation

                                                                                                         21
which enables us to obtain an analytical solution for the policy function of capital.                         Note


that when there are no costs in adjustment of the volume of capital, i.e.                       δ = 1,        (15)-


(18) implies that adjustment to the steady state is instantaneous. Thus adjustment costs


for capital play much the same role in capital adjustment (16) as iceberg trade costs play

  21 The intuition is that given real GDP at point t, the optimal distribution of income on investment and
consumption in      t   is a constant share, irrespective of what will happen in the future.

preferences only, the similarity is even closer.)

   The beauty of system (19)-(24) is that the universe of bilateral trade linkages are con-


sistently aggregated for each country and they are nested in the `upper level' capital accu-

mulation framework via the MRs.               Our strategy in the subsequent sections is to translate


system (19)-(24) into an econometric model, which we estimate in order test and establish


the causal relationships between trade, income and growth and to recover the structural


parameters of the model (as well as some data), which are needed to perform our counter-


factual experiments. Before that, however, we discuss the structural relationships of trade


liberalization on growth that our model oers.

  22 With the given parameter restrictions on   α, β , and δ , the solution for the endogenous variables of system
(19)-(24) can be shown to be unique.

3.1 Growth and Trade: A Discussion
The relationships between growth/capital accumulation and trade are illustrated by a hy-


pothetical trade liberalization scenario acting on system (19)-(24). Consider a reduction of


bilateral trade costs tij at some point in time t, e.g. a bilateral free trade agreement between


partners     i    and   j.   First, the direct (partial-equilibrium) eect of a fall in                    tij,t   is an immedi-


ate increase in bilateral trade between partners                   i   and   j   at time     t   without any implications


for the rest of the countries. This eect is captured by equation (19) for given output and


multilateral resistances.


   Second, trade liberalization between countries                      i   and   j   at time     t   has an indirect eect on


trade ows through the MRs given in equations (20) and (21). Anderson and van Wincoop


(2004) emphasize that MRs are general equilibrium constructs that aggregate consistently


all bilateral trade costs. For producers in a given country, the outward MR eectively acts as


the friction faced if they ship to a unied world market. Inward MR aggregates all bilateral


trade costs faced by the consumer in a given country as if they buy from a unied world


market. A reduction in trade costs between any two countries aects trade ows between


all other country pairs in time                t   through their MRs. Hence, those terms capture the third-


country eects through trade creation and trade diversion. In particular, opening to trade


between countries            i   and   j   will translate into lower MRs (lower resistance for producers and


lower prices for consumers) in the liberalizing countries, while producers and consumers in


the rest of the world will suer higher trade resistance.


   Third, and most important for the purposes of this paper, trade liberalization acts on


output and capital accumulation via changes in prices in the world. In combination, equa-


tions (22)-(23) depict the contemporaneous eects of changes in trade costs on factory-gate


prices   pj,t ,   and on the value of domestic production/income                        yj,t .   Intuitively, equation (22)


captures the fact that a lower trade resistance (i.e. a lower outward multilateral resistance)


faced by the producers in a liberalizing country translates into higher factory-gate prices.


The latter will lead to an increase in the value of domestic production/income via equation



                                                              17
(23).   The opposite happens in outside countries, which now face higher trade resistance.


Importantly, these eects are channeled through the outward multilateral resistance, which,


as discussed above, means that a change in trade costs between any two countries may aect


prices and output in any other country in the world.


   Fourth, equation (24) captures the eects of trade liberalization on capital accumula-


tion. These eects are channeled through the factory-gate prices     pj,t   and through the inward


MRs. A change in trade costs will cause a change in factory-gate prices via equation (22).


In response, a change in the capital stock begins via equation (24).           As discussed earlier,


the relationship between prices of domestically produced goods and capital accumulation


is direct. We demonstrate that trade liberalization will result in higher factory-gate prices


leading to more investment for the liberalizing countries, and in lower factory-gate prices


leading to less investment for outsiders. The relationship between capital accumulation and


the inward multilateral resistance   Pj,t   is inverse (see equation (24)).     Trade liberalization


will lead to lower MRs followed by more investment in the liberalizing countries, and to


higher MRs followed by lower investment in outside countries. The changes in the MRs can


be viewed as an embedded capital accumulation eect of trade liberalization. In combina-


tion, accumulation has elasticity with respect to the terms of trade        pj,t /Pj,t   equal to   δ,   the


depreciation rate.


   Finally, we note that the changes in the value of output will have additional (direct and


indirect) eects on trade and world prices. The direct, positive eects of output on trade are


captured by equation (19). In addition, changes in output will aect trade ows indirectly


via changes in the multilateral resistances that are captured by equations (20) and (21).


In turn, the changes in the MRs will lead to additional, third-order changes in output and


capital accumulation, and so forth. These eects are essentially identical to the eects of


growth on trade in our model, to which we turn.


   Growth aects trade via two channels, directly and indirectly. The direct eect of growth


on trade is strictly positive and it is channeled through changes in country size. An increase




                                                 18
in the size of an economy results in more exports and in more imports between this country


and all its trading partners. It should be emphasized that the increase in size in member


countries may actually stimulate exports from non-members to the extent that these eects


dominate the standard trade diversion forces triggered by preferential trade liberalization.


We nd evidence of that in our counterfactual experiments.


    The indirect eect of growth on trade is channeled trough changes in trade costs.                        In


particular, changes in any country size translate into changes in the multilateral resistances


for all countries, which lead to changes in trade ows. Thus the MR channel is a general


equilibrium system: i.e. growth in one country will aect trade costs and impact welfare


in every other country in the world.            The model reveals that growth in a given country


translates into lower sellers' incidence on the producers in this country. In addition, all else


equal, the benets of growth in one country are shared with the rest of the world through


lower buyers' incidence in its trading partners. The growth-led changes in the sellers' and


buyers' incidence of trade costs lead to additional changes in capital stocks activating further


changes in GDP, multilateral resistances, and factory-gate prices.


    The dynamic feature of our model allows quantication of the intuition that preferential


trade liberalization (e.g. a RTA) may benet non-members through the growth of members


and the resultant terms of trade improvement of non-members. By making investment more


attractive, a RTA will stimulate growth in the member countries. This will lead to lower


sellers' incidence for these countries, but also to lower buyers' incidence in non-members.


The latter complements the direct positive size eect of member countries on non-member

                                        23
exports that we described above.

  23 Theory reveals that, in principle, growth due to regional trade liberalization can lead to benets for
outside countries that do not participate in the integration eort. Such eects can not be observed in an
aggregate setting such as ours, but are more likely to arise within a multi-sector framework where growth
leads to specialization. It should also be noted, however, that even though we do not observe positive welfare
eects for outside countries in our sample, we do nd non-monotonic trade diversion eects. In some cases
(e.g. the Czech Republic, Ireland, and the Netherlands) the dynamic forces in our framework lead to trade
creation eects that are stronger than the initial static trade diversion eects. Details are available in Table
A1 of Online Appendix G.

   The change in capital expression (26) is quite intuitive.                                        First, if     Pj   increases, capital


accumulation becomes more expensive and decreases capital because                                                Pj    captures the price


of investment as well as consumption.                     Second, increases in sellers' incidence                               Πj   reduce


capital stock   K j . Πj   aects   pj   inversely, so the value marginal product of capital falls with


Πj , decreasing the incentive to accumulate capital.                         Third, as the world gets richer, measured


by an increase of world GDP (y
                             b), capital accumulation in                                    j   increases to eciently serve the

3.3 Growth and Trade: Sucient Statistics
In a recent inuential paper ACR demonstrate that the welfare eects of trade liberalization


in a wide range of trade models can be summarized by the following sucient statistics:
         1
W    b 1−σ ,
cj = λ         where   λ
                       bjj   denotes the share of domestic expenditure.
      jj

    Stimulated by ACR, we show (see Online Appendix D for details) that the change in


capital can directly be related to welfare by deriving an extended ACR formula:

                                                             1
                                              W    b jα λ
                                              cj = K    b 1−σ .                                        (27)
                                                          jj



    Equation (27) implies that an increase of steady-state capital will, ceteris paribus, in-


crease welfare. The extended ACR formula given in (27) holds in and out-of steady-state.


Furthermore, as demonstrated in Online Appendix D, we can express                   K
                                                                                    bj   in terms of   λ
                                                                                                       b   in
                                          1

                              cj = λ
                                   b
                                     jj            . This expression nicely highlights the similarity of


introducing capital or intermediates in the steady state (compare with the formulas given in


ACR, p. 115). However, in our dynamic framework capital accumulation is the result of an


optimized intertemporal choice of consumers and we can trace the resulting transition be-


tween two steady-states. Accounting for this transition has important welfare consequences,


as (i) the transition takes time and the welfare gains and losses therefore have to be dis-


counted, and (ii) the gains and losses are non-uniformly distributed over time. While we are


able to derive an ACR-like welfare formula, which only depends on              λ
                                                                               b   and parameters when


taking into account the transition (see Online Appendix D.2), we will typically not observe


changes in   λjj   over time solely driven by the counterfactual under consideration. However,


by using our system, we can calculate the transition in our welfare counterfactual analysis.



4     Empirical Analysis

Our model is straightforward to implement empirically.                It simultaneously enables us to


test and establish the causal relationships between trade, income and growth and delivers




                                                       21
all the key parameters needed to perform counterfactuals.       The parameter estimates are


compared to standard values from the existing literature to establish the credibility of our


methods. The econometric framework includes as a special case the reduced-form growth-


and-trade specication from Frankel and Romer (1999), but also expands on it by introducing


an additional estimating equation for capital accumulation while highlighting important


contributions of our structural approach. Section 4.1 presents the estimation strategy and


some econometric challenges.    Section 4.2 describes the data and Section 4.3 presents the


estimates.



4.1 Econometric Specication
We translate our theoretical model into estimating equations in two steps. We begin with the


estimation strategy for the `lower level', the gravity model of trade ows. Then we describe


the estimation strategy for the `upper level', i.e. for income and for capital.


4.1.1 `Lower Level' Econometric Specication: Trade
To obtain sound econometric estimates of bilateral trade costs and, subsequently, of the


multilateral resistances that enter the income and capital equations, several econometric


challenges must be met.    First, we follow Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) in the use of


the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood (PPML) estimator to account for the presence of


heteroskedasticity in trade data. Additionally, it allows for zero trade ows. Second, we use


time-varying, directional (exporter and importer), country-specic xed eects to account


for the unobservable multilateral resistances. Importantly, in addition to controlling for the


multilateral resistances, the xed eects in our econometric specication also absorb national


output and expenditures and, therefore, control for all dynamic forces from our theory. Third,


to avoid the critique from Cheng and Wall (2005) that `[f]ixed-eects estimation is sometimes


criticized when applied to data pooled over consecutive years on the grounds that dependent


and independent variables cannot fully adjust in a single year's time.' (footnote 8, p. 52),




                                              22
                            24
we use 3-year intervals.         The nal step, which completes the econometric specication of


our trade system, is to provide structure behind the unobservable bilateral trade costs. To


do this, we employ the standard set of gravity variables from the existing literature and we


dene the power transforms of bilateral trade costs as:

              h              5
                             X                                                       i
 t1−σ
  ij,t   = exp η1 RT Aij,t +   ηm ln DISTij,m−1 + η6 BRDRij + η7 LAN Gij + η8 CLN Yij ,                      (28)
                              m=2

where,    RT Aij,t is a dummy variable equal to 1 when i and j have a RTA in place at time t, and
                 25
zero elsewhere.       The presence or absence of RTAs, and more specically NAFTA, will be the


basis for our counterfactual experiments.                ln DISTij,m−1   is the logarithm of bilateral distance


between trading partners         i   and   j.    We follow Eaton and Kortum (2002) to decompose the


distance eects into four intervals,            m ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5}.   The distance intervals, in kilometers, are:


[0, 3000); [3000, 7000); [7000, 10000); [10000, maximum].                    BRDRij    captures the presence of


a contiguous border between partners                 i   and   j . LAN Gij   and   CLN Yij   account for common


language and colonial ties, respectively.


    One nal econometric consideration that we address is the potential endogeneity of RTAs.

                                                                                       26
The issue of RTA endogeneity is well-known in the trade literature                           and to address it, we


adopt the method from Baier and Bergstrand (2007) and use country-pair xed eects in


order to account for the unobservable linkages between the endogenous RTA covariate and


the error term in trade regressions.


    Taking all of the above considerations into account and using equation (28) for the speci-

                        1−σ
cation of trade costs tij,t , we use PPML to estimate the following econometric specication


of the   Trade equation    (19) of our structural system:

  24 Treer (2004) also criticizes trade estimations pooled over consecutive years. He uses three-year intervals.
Baier and Bergstrand (2007) use 5-year intervals. Olivero and Yotov (2012) provide empirical evidence that
gravity estimates obtained with 3-year and 5-year lags are very similar, but the yearly estimates produce
suspicious trade cost parameters. Here, we use 3-year intervals in order to improve eciency, but we also
experiment with 4- and 5-year lags to obtain qualitatively identical and quantitatively very similar results.
  25 The original source for data on regional trade agreements is the World Trade Organization.              A de-
tailed description of the RTA data used and the data set itself can be found at http://www.ewf.uni-

   Here,   χi,t    denotes the time-varying source-country dummies, which control for the out-


ward multilateral resistances and countries' output shares.               πj,t encompasses the time varying
destination country dummy variables that account for the inward multilateral resistances and


total expenditure.        µij   denotes the set of country-pair xed eects that should absorb the


linkages between      RT Aij,t     and the remainder error term        ij,t   in order to control for potential


endogeneity of the former.            Importantly,     µij    will absorb all time-invariant gravity covari-


ates from (28) along with any other time-invariant determinants of trade costs that are not

                                                                                                bij   to measure


international trade costs. However, due to missing (or zero) trade ows, we cannot identify


the complete set of bilateral xed eects.               Therefore, in order to construct bilateral trade


costs, we adopt a procedure similar to the one from Anderson and Yotov (2011) who propose


a two-step method to construct bilateral trade costs, while accounting for RTA endogeneity


with country-pair xed eects. Applied to our setting, the rst step of this method obtains


estimates of the country-pair xed eects             µij    from equation (29). Then, in the second stage,


the estimates of the bilateral xed eects are regressed on the set of standard gravity variables


from equation (28):

   Below, we use (32) to study the dynamic general equilibrium eects of NAFTA and


globalization on growth and welfare. (For the NAFTA exercise, we abstract from modeling


tari revenues and rents in order to isolate and focus on the key dynamic channels in our


framework.)


4.1.2 `Upper Level' Econometric Specication: Income and Capital
We now turn to the `upper level', where we estimate the equations for income and for


capital accumulation. The former will enable us to obtain estimates of the trade elasticity


of substitution and of the labor and capital shares in production.                                The latter will deliver


country-specic estimates of the capital depreciation rates.

   Income.        We start with the estimating equation for income. Transforming the theoretical

specication for income into an estimating equation for growth is straight forward:                                            We

substitute equation (22) for prices into equation (23), solve for                      yj,t   and express the resulting

equation in natural logarithmic form:
                                                                                                                     !

   ln yj,t    = ln yt +      ln    +              ln Lj,t +          Kj,t − ln                                           .    (33)
               σ          σ     γj       σ                     σ           σ                                  Π1−σ
                                                                                                               j,t

   We keep the expression for the outward multilateral resistance as a power transform,


ln(1/Π1−σ
      j,t ), because we can recover this power term directly from the `lower level' estimation

procedures without the need to assume any value for the trade elasticity of substitution                                        σ.
As demonstrated below, our methods also enable us to obtain our own estimate of                                      σ.
   Two steps deliver a simple estimating equation for income. First, we introduce year xed

                               1
eects   νt   to control for
                               σ
                                   ln yt , which may be measured with error, and also to control for any
other time-varying variables that may aect output in addition to the time varying covariates


that enter our specication explicitly. Second, we do not observe                             Aj,t   and data on     γj      is not


available. To account for the latter, we introduce country xed eects                               ϑj .   The idea is that,


in combination with the year xed eects, the country xed eects will absorb most of the


variability in    Aj,t   in our sample. We sum any residual eects of technology in the error term




                                                               25
εj,t .27   Hence, equation (33) becomes:
                                                                         !
                                                                    1
                    ln yj,t = κ1 ln Lj,t + κ2 Kj,t + κ3 ln                   + νt + ϑj + εj,t .             (34)
                                                                  Π1−σ
                                                                   j,t


     Here,   κ1 = (σ − 1)(1 − α)/σ , κ2 = (σ − 1)α/σ , and κ3 = −1/σ .              Importantly, a signicant


estimate of the coecient on the MR term,               κ
                                                        b3 , will support a causal relationship of trade on
income. In addition,      κ
                          b3   can be used to recover the trade elasticity of substitution directly


as   σ      κ3 .28
     b = −1/b          With        σ
                                   b   at hand, we can also obtain the capital share of production

            b/(b        b2 /(1 + κ
                                 b3 ).             Finally, our model implies the following structural


relationship between the coecients on the three covariates in (34),                   κ1 + κ2 = 1 + κ3 .
     In addition to delivering some key parameters, equation (34) highlights two of our main


contributions to the literature. First, the introduction of               ln(1/Π1−σ
                                                                                j,t )     in equation (34) has


implications for the calculations and the analysis of total factor productivity. As discussed


in Anderson (2011), a change in the outward multilateral resistance, which measures the


incidence of trade costs on producers, can be interpreted as a productivity shock.                           For


example, lower multilateral resistance has positive eects on producers and can be viewed as


an increase in productivity. Equation (34) accounts for these eects explicitly and implies


that the TFP estimates from empirical specications that do not control for the inuence of


trade costs might be biased.


     Second, in combination, equations (29) and (34) deliver a structural foundation for the


inuential reduced-form specication of the relationship between income and trade from


Frankel and Romer (1999):

  27 We are aware of the successful eorts to estimate productivity with available rm-level data, cf. Olley and
Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin (2003). However, the aggregate nature of our study does not allow us
to implement those estimation approaches. The plausible estimates of the production function parameters
that we obtain in the empirical analysis are encouraging evidence that our treatment of technology with
country and time xed eects is eective.
  28 The ability to estimate   σ   is a nice feature of our model, especially because this parameter is viewed in
the literature as the single most important parameter in international trade (see ACR). Furthermore, we
will be able to compare our estimates with existing estimates in order to gauge the success of our methods.

of trade and trade costs are channeled via the structural trade term                            j,t       .   In the


empirical analysis below we estimate system (35)-(36) with the original Frankel and Romer


methods and with our structural approach.


   One nal consideration concerning the estimation of system (35)-(36) is that the trade


term    ln(1/Π1−σ
              j,t )   in equation (36) is endogenous by construction, because it includes own


national income.      We eliminate this endogeneity concern mechanically by calculating the


multilateral resistances based on international trade linkages only. Specically, to obtain the

                                                                           1−σ

   Capital.      Our theory allows us to go a step further in the econometric modeling of


the relationship between trade and growth. Specically, in addition to oering a structural


foundation for the empirical trade-and-income system from Frankel and Romer (1999), we


complement it with an additional estimating equation that captures the eects of trade


(liberalization) on capital accumulation, our driver for growth. Equation (24) translates into




                                                       27
a simple log-linear econometric model:



                   ln Kj,t = ψ1 ln yj,t−1 + ψ2 ln Kj,t−1 + ψ3 ln Pj,t−1 + νt + ϑj + ςj,t ,             (39)



   where:     ψ1 = δ    captures the positive relationship between investment and the value of


marginal product of capital. As discussed in our theory section, this relationship is driven by


the general-equilibrium impact of changes in trade costs on factory-gate prices.                ψ2 = 1 − δ
captures the dependence of current on past capital stock.              Finally,    ψ3 = −δ     captures the


intuitive inverse relationship between capital accumulation and the prices of consumption


and investment goods, which also capture the indirect, general-equilibrium eects of changes


in trade costs on capital accumulation. Thus, a signicant estimate of            ψ3 will support a causal
relationship of trade on capital accumulation. Additionally,           νt   and   ϑj   are year and country


xed eects that control for parameters         δ ln [(αβδ)/(1 − β + βδ)] and any other time-varying
and country-varying variables that may aect capital accumulation. Our model implies the


following structural relationships between the coecients on the three covariates in equation


(39),   ψ1 = −ψ3    and   ψ1 = 1 − ψ2 .   In addition to delivering a single depreciation parameter      δ,
equation (39) can be used to estimate country-specic depreciation parameters by interacting


each of the terms of the right-hand side with country dummies. We experiment with such


specications in our empirical analysis.


   In combination, equations (35), (36), and (39), deliver the econometric version of our


structural system of growth and trade:



        T rade :       xij,t = exp[γ1 RT Aij + χi,t + πj,t + µij ] + ij,t ] + ij,t ,                 (40)

   System (40)-(42) obtains estimates of the key parameters needed to calibrate our model


of trade and growth. In addition, the system will enable us to isolate and identify the causal

Our sample covers 82 countries over the period 1990-2011.                             These countries account for


more than 98 percent of world GDP throughout the period of investigation.                             In order to


perform the analysis, we use data on trade ows, GDP, employment, capital and RTAs.


In addition, we construct a set of bilateral trade costs with data on the standard gravity


variables including distance, common language, contiguity and colonial ties.


     Data on GDP, employment, and capital stocks are from the latest edition of the Penn

                              30

the recommendation of the data developers, we employ                           Output-side real GDP at current
PPPs (CGDP o ),               which compares relative productive capacity across countries at a single


point in time, as the initial level in our counterfactual experiments, and we use                      Real GDP
using national-accounts growth rates (CGDP na ) for our output-based cross-country income
regressions. The Penn World Tables 8.0 include data that enables us to measure employment


in eective units. To do this we multiply the                     Number of persons engaged in the labor force
with the         Human capital index, which is based on average years of schooling.             Capital stocks (at

4.3 Estimation Results and Analysis
4.3.1 Trade Costs
We start with a brief discussion of our estimate of the eects of RTAs, which is obtained


from equation (29) with a PPML estimator to account for heteroskedasticity and zero trade,


with bilateral xed eects to control for potential RTA endogeneity, and with exporter-time


and importer-time xed eects to account for the structural MRs, income, and expenditure


shares. Based on this specication, we obtain an estimate of the average treatment eect of


RTAs that is equal to 0.827 (std.err. 0.083), which is readily comparable to the corresponding

                                                        31
index of 0.76 from Baier and Bergstrand (2007).              This gives us condence to use our


estimate of the RTA eects to proxy for the eects of trade liberalization in the counterfactual


experiments below.

   Next, we discuss the estimates of bilateral trade costs that we obtain from equation

(30). We start with a summary of the estimates of the coecients on the standard gravity

covariates. For brevity, we report the estimates directly in the estimating equation:

 31 Our RTA estimate suggest a partial equilibrium increase of 129% (100   × [exp(0.827) − 1])   in bilateral
trade ows among member countries.

where the coecient estimates are reported in bold-face in front of the variables, and the


corresponding robust standard errors are in parentheses below them. As can be seen from


equation (43), all coecient estimates have the expected signs and reasonable magnitudes.


We nd that distance is a strong impediment to trade. All distance estimates are signicant


at any conventional level. In addition, we nd that the largest estimate (in absolute value)


is for the shortest distance interval. This is in accordance with the results from Eaton and


Kortum (2002). Contiguous borders and common language promote international trade. The


estimates on   BRDR          and   LAN G     are positive, large, statistically signicant and comparable


to estimates from the existing literature. The estimate of the coecient on                   CLN Y     is positive


but it is not statistically signicant. This result is consistent with the sectoral ndings from


Anderson and Yotov (2011) and suggests that colonial ties no longer play such an important


role in promoting trade, at least for the country-sample under investigation. Overall, we nd


the gravity estimates from equation (43) to be plausible, and we are comfortable using them


to construct bilateral trade costs for our counterfactuals below.


   We employ the estimates from equation (43) together with data on the gravity variables


to construct a complete set of bilateral trade costs                     t1−σ

                                                                                     µij ),   where      \
                                                                                                        exp(b

the predicted value from equation (43), which are used in our counterfactual experiments.


Without going into details, we briey discuss several properties of the bilateral trade costs,
                                                    1/(1−σ)
which are constructed as           b      \
                                   tij = exp(b
                                             µij )            and we use a conventional value of the trade


elasticity of substitution,        σ = 6.   First, without any exception and in accordance with theory,


all estimates of   tij
                   b      are positive and greater than one. Second, we nd that the estimates of


the bilateral xed eects vary widely but intuitively across the country pairs in our sample.


For example, we obtain the lowest estimates of                 tij
                                                               b     for countries that are geographically and


culturally close and economically integrated. The smallest estimate of bilateral trade costs is


for the pair Belgium-Netherlands (1.796). On the other extreme of the spectrum, we obtain



                                                          31
very large estimates of           tij
                                  b     for countries that are isolated economically and geographically.


The largest estimate is for the pair Singapore-Ecuador (4.352).


       Finally, we construct internal trade costs as the product between internal distance and


the estimates on the coecient on              ln DISTij,1 .32   While not central for our dynamic analysis


and main results, our treatment of internal trade costs improves on the standard approach


in the literature, where countries are point masses.                  Specically, (i) we allow for     positive
internal trade costs, and (ii) we allow for            country-specic       internal trade costs. Overall, we


view our estimates of bilateral trade costs as convincing and we are condent in using them


to construct the multilateral resistances and to perform counterfactual experiments.


4.3.2 Income
Next, we turn to the `upper level' and we estimate our                 Income equation :
                                                                             !
                                                                       1
                    ln yj,t = κ1 ln Lj,t + κ2 ln Kj,t + κ3 ln                    + νt + ϑj + εj,t .        (44)
                                                                     Π̃1−σ
                                                                       j,t

       Here, following the discussion in Section 4.1.2, the multilateral resistances are constructed


according to system (37)-(38) in order to account for potential endogeneity.


       Estimates from various specications of equation (44) are reported in Table 1. All speci-


cations include year xed eects and country xed eects and we report robust, bootstrapped


standard-errors where generated regressors are included in our specications, i.e. in columns


(2) and (3) of Table 1.            In column (1) of the table, we oer results from a standard con-

                                                                                   33
strained estimation of the Cobb-Douglas production function.                            As can be seen from the


table, both the labor and the capital shares have reasonable magnitudes and are within the


theoretical bound       [0; 1].   This suggests that our sample is representative.


       In column (2) of Table 1 we introduce as an additional regressor the original Frankel

  32 ln DIST
              ij,1 is based on the smallest distance interval in our sample and all internal distances fall
within this interval.     Consistent with the measure of international distance, internal distance is con-
structed as a population weighted average of the bilateral distances between the cities within each coun-
try.    For further details see CEPII's Distances Database, available for download at http://www.cepii.fr/
cepii/en/bdd_modele/bdd.asp.
  33 In Table 4 of Appendix A.1 we report unconstrained results from all specications that we present in
this section. Our sensitivity estimates are qualitatively identical and quantitatively very similar to the main,
constrained results from Table 1.

regression as given in equation (40). In accordance with the results from Frankel and Romer


(1999), the estimates from column (2) suggest that the eect of trade on income/growth is


positive and statistically signicant.


   In column (3), we replace the reduced-form Frankel and Romer specication with our


structural model. Several properties stand out. First, all estimates from column (3) of Table


1 have expected signs and are statistically signicant at any conventional level. Importantly,


and similar to Frankel and Romer (1999), we nd that trade openness leads to higher income.


Thus, we oer evidence for a causal relationship between trade and income/growth. This is


captured by the negative and signicant estimate of the coecient of our inverse theoretical

measure of trade openness

                              ln 1/Π̃j,t .           Next, we capitalize on the structural properties of


our model to recover a plausible estimate of the trade elasticity of substitution. In particular,


we obtain a value of   b = −1/b
                       σ      κ3 = 5.100               (std.err. 0.804), which satises the theoretical


restriction that the trade elasticity should be greater than one and falls comfortably within


the distribution of the existing (Armington) elasticity numbers from the trade literature,


which usually vary between 2 and 12 (see the references in footnote 14). Finally, using these


estimates and applying the structural restrictions of our model, in the bottom panel of the


table we recover an estimate of          0.550   (std.err. 0.041) for the capital share       α.
   We proceed with two sensitivity experiments. For brevity, we report the estimation results


from these experiments in Appendix A.1, and here we just discuss our ndings. First, we


allow capital shares to vary over time. The intuition is that capital shares have increased


steadily over the past quarter century and our data should reect that. In accordance with


that, we nd that the average capital shares in our sample have increased from                     0.391 (std.err.
0.114) during the 1990s to       0.603     (std.err. 0.061) during the 2000s.             Next, we distinguish


between capital shares in poor versus rich countries.                  We dene rich countries as those


with income above the median income in each year of our sample. In accordance with our




                                                        33
expectations, we nd that production in rich countries is more capital intensive than in poor


countries.     Specically, we estimate a statistically signicant dierence of 8.3 percentage


points between the capital shares of the two groups of countries.                       Overall, the parameter


estimates of the capital share       α     and of the elasticity of substitution        σ   that we obtain in this


section are within the bounds established in the literature and we view them as plausible.


4.3.3 Capital
We proceed with estimation of our capital accumulation specication:



                ln Kj,t = ψ0 + ψ1 ln yj,t−1 + ψ2 ln Kj,t−1 + ψ3 ln Pj,t−1 + νt + ϑj + ςj,t .                 (45)



    Equation (45) will enable us to recover capital depreciation rates (δ 's) subject to the

                                                                                                             34
following relationships:      ψ1 = δ ; ψ2 = 1 − δ ;    and      ψ3 = −δ .   Our results are encouraging:



                       ln Kj,t = 0.052 ln yj,t−1 + 0.948 ln Kj,t−1 − 0.052 ln Pj,t−1 .                       (46)
                                 (0.006)              (0.006)                 (0.006)


    First, the estimates of the three covariates are all signicant and with expected signs.


In addition, they imply a reasonable value for               δ = 0.052      (std.err. 0.006). Importantly, the


estimate of the coecient on the trade term            ln Pj,t−1   is statistically signicant, which implies


a causal relationship between trade and capital accumulation. In accordance with our theory,


the estimate of       ψ3 captures the inverse relationship between investment and investment costs.
Finally, we obtain a positive and signicant estimate of the coecient on the value of output


which, as suggested by our model, captures the positive relationship between the value of


marginal product of capital and investment.


    In our next experiment, we use equation (45) to obtain country-specic depreciation rate


estimates    δi 's.   To do this, we interact each of the three covariates on the right-hand side


of equation (45) with country dummies, and we impose the theoretical constraints of our


model.   The resulting country-specic estimates are reported in column (6) of Table 7 in

  34 Coecient estimates are reported in bold-face in front of the variables, and the corresponding robust,
bootstrapped standard errors are in parentheses below them. The regression includes year and country xed
eects whose estimates are omitted for brevity.




                                                        34
Appendix A.1. Two properties stand out. First, without any exception and in accordance


with theory, all estimates of   δ   are positive but smaller than one. Second, the estimates vary


signicantly but within reasonable bounds, ranging between 0.03 (std.err. 0.005) for China,


and 0.161 (std.err. 0.016) for Zimbabwe.


   According to our theory, the change in the value of marginal product of capital is driven


by changes in factory-gate prices in response to trade liberalization. Since consistent inter-


national data on factory-gate prices are not available, in our next experiment we attempt


to draw inference for their eects as a residual impact after we control for all other factors


that aect investment in our model.         Specication (46) already controls for the eects of


capital and trade via the multilateral resistances.       In addition, we use year and country


xed eects in order to capture dierences in technology and other country and time spe-


cic unobservables. Thus, we may identify the eects of prices by isolating the impact of


labor on capital accumulation from the value of output in specication (46). Results from


a constrained and an unconstrained version of specication (46), where labor is added as


an additional covariate, are reported in Table 6 of Appendix A.1. The estimates of all vari-


ables are highly statistically signicant and with expected signs in both specications. We


obtain positive and signicant estimates of the eects of labor, which are expected. More


importantly, we nd that the estimate of the coecient on          ln yj,t−1   remains positive and


statistically signicant, which is consistent with our theory.


   In summary, this section demonstrated that our theoretical model translates into a very


simple and intuitive structural system that is straightforward to implement empirically. Im-


portantly, our results oered evidence for the causal impact of trade on growth and we were


able to obtain plausible estimates for all but one of the parameters that we need for our


counterfactual experiments and analysis. The single parameter for which we did not obtain


our own indexes, and which we have to borrow from the literature, is the consumer depreci-


ation rate. Minimum values, maximum values, and (when appropriate) standard errors for


each of the parameters in our model are reported in Table 2.

     Overall, we are encouraged by our empirical results and we are comfortable using the


estimated parameters to perform the counterfactual experiments that we present next.



5       Counterfactual Experiments

Counterfactual experiments reveal the implications of our estimated model for, respectively,


the eect of trade liberalization on growth and the eect of growth on trade. For the eects


of trade liberalization on growth, we estimate the eects of the North American Free Trade


Agreement (NAFTA), and the eects of a fall in international trade costs for all countries


(globalization). The eects of growth on trade are illustrated by simulation of the eects


of a 20% change of the capital stock in the United States.                   We also perform a series of


sensitivity experiments using a dierent functional form for capital accumulation, allowance


for intermediate goods, and alternative values for the parameters of our model.


     The basis for the counterfactual experiments includes the observed data on labor en-


dowments      (Lj,t )   and GDPs    (yj,t )   for our sample of 82 countries.       In addition: (i) we con-

                    1−σ
struct trade costs tij,t from our estimates according to equation (32); (ii) we recover theory-


consistent, steady-state capital stocks according to the capital accumulation equation (25);


(iii) we calculate baseline preference-adjusted technology               Aj /γj   according to the market-

                                                                               35
clearing equation (22) and the production function equation (23).                   For parameter estimates


in the baseline case we use our own estimates of the elasticity of substitution              σ
                                                                                             b = 5.1 and the
share of capital in the Cobb-Douglas production function              α
                                                                      b = 0.55 from column (3) of Table
1, and the capital depreciation rate           δb = 0.052   obtained from equation (46). The consumers'

                                                                                            36
discount factor is set equal to       β = 0.98,     which is standard in the literature.


     Our framework provides a smell test of our capital accumulation model prior to its

                                                      37
use for policy evaluation counterfactuals.                  Our parameter estimates are comparable to

    35 Online Appendix E oers a detailed description of our counterfactual setup and procedures.
    36 Alternatively, we could solve our system in changes following Dekle, Eaton, and Kortum (2007, 2008).
The results are identical to the results from the system in levels. For details please see Online Appendix F.
    37 Ottaviano (2014) notes that validation of calibrated models before simulating them has increasingly gone
missing as recent works tend to favor the implementation of `exactly identied' [New Quantitative Trade
Models]...Validation requires the calibrated model to be able to match other moments of the data dierent
from those used for calibrating. Simulation of counterfactual scenarios can be reasonably performed only if



                                                           36
corresponding values from existing studies. The smell test compares our calculated theory-


consistent, steady-state capital stocks with the observed capital stocks from the Penn World


Tables 8.0. Figure 1 plots the calculated stock of capital with the Penn capital stock data.


The correlation coecient is       0.98.   This is strong supporting evidence for the capital accu-


mulation implications of our model.



5.1 The Eects of Trade Liberalization and Globalization
Our main counterfactual experiment evaluates the welfare eects of NAFTA and we com-


plement the existing literature by oering estimates of the dynamic eects of NAFTA on

                                           38
member and non-member countries.                Results reported in Table 3 are decomposed into three


stages of increasing general equilibrium adjustment. The rst column of Table 3 lists country


names. The next three columns present the NAFTA eects on welfare, where reported num-


bers are percentage changes in welfare due to the implementation of NAFTA. Column (2)


reports the Conditional General Equilibrium (Conditional GE) eects of NAFTA, which


include the direct eects of the bilateral changes in trade costs with resulting changes in


the MRs (19)-(21) at constant GDPs. These indexes correspond to the the Modular Trade


Impact (MTI) eects from Head and Mayer (2014). Column (3) presents the static GDP


changes in response to formation of NAFTA. We label this scenario Full Static GE and it

the calibrated model passes the validation checks. (pp. 3-4).
  38 For instance Krueger (1999), Lederman, Maloney, and Servén (2005), Romalis (2007), Treer (2004,
2006), Anderson and Yotov (2011) and Caliendo and Parro (2015).        Krueger (1999) nds in here gravity
analysis an increase of trade among NAFTA members of 46%.          Lederman, Maloney, and Servén (2005)
provide a detailed summary of many studies and nd in their own gravity based estimates eects on trade
ows of NAFTA of about 40%. They also conclude that the bulk of the rise in trade as a consequence of
NAFTA is due to income eects, both static and dynamic through capital accumulation. Romalis (2007)
nds trade eects within NAFTA of up to nearly 30%, while the resulting welfare eects are small. Treer
(2004, 2006) highlights the short- and long-run eects of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement,
showing that low-productivity plants reduced employment by 12% while industry level labor productivity was
increased by 15%. Overall, the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement was welfare-enhancing according
to a simple welfare analysis undertaken. Anderson and Yotov (2011) oer static general equilibrium analysis
of the eects of NAFTA. They nd a 6% increase in the real GDP for Mexico and small (less than 1%) positive
welfare eects for Canada and U.S. Caliendo and Parro (2015) nd the largest increase in exports and imports
for Mexico (up to 14%), followed by the United States and Canada. The welfare eects, measured by real
wages, were positive in all NAFTA countries, with Mexico having the largest gains of up to 1.5%. There is
also a related evaluation of the eects of NAFTA in the computational general equilibrium literature, see for
example McCleery (1992), Klein and Salvatore (1995), Brown, Deardor, and Stern (1992a,b), Fox (1999),
Kehoe (2003), Rolleigh (2013) and Shikher (2012).

corresponds to the General Equilibrium Trade Impact (GETI) eects from Head and Mayer


(2014). Finally, in column (4), we turn on the capital accumulation channel to estimate the


eects of NAFTA in Full Dynamic GE scenarios, one for the steady state and one for the

              39
transition.


    The Conditional GE estimates from column (2) of Table 3 reveal large gains for NAFTA


members. Canada experiences the largest gains, with an increase of real GDP per capita of


about 15%. Mexico's welfare increases by about 9%, while U.S. enjoys only modest welfare

                                                                                40
gains of 0.8%.     These numbers are in line with previous studies.                  In contrast, there are


negative NAFTA eects for all other countries in the world due to trade diversion. Notably,


the negative eects on non-member countries are small (less than 1%, except for Guatemala


with -1.2%). The largest losses are predicted for Latin American countries that are in close


geographic proximity and large economic interdependence with the NAFTA members. The


bottom panel of Table 3 reports that on average non-NAFTA members will suer a -0.22%


decrease in welfare.


    In column (3) of Table 3, we report estimates from the Full Static GE scenario that


allows for responses of factory-gate prices due to the formation of NAFTA. Compared to


the Conditional GE scenario, the positive welfare eects double for all NAFTA members.


Most of these additional gains are for the `producers' in NAFTA members. The intuition is


that changes in factory-gate prices due to NAFTA enter directly in our calculation of real


GDP in the Full Static GE scenario, while the eects on consumers are constructed as a

                                                                    41
weighted average among all delivered prices in the world.                The large positive welfare eects

  39 Further details of the eects of NAFTA on trade ows, the multilateral resistances, and the capital
eects can be found in Table A1 in Online Appendix G. Since the direct eects of NAFTA on bilateral trade
are conned to members only, we devote the analysis in this section to the GE eects of NAFTA. According
to our estimates NAFTA will increase members' trade by 129%.
  40 One would expect smaller eects for Canada as compared to Mexico because many of the gains from
trade between Canada and the U.S. have already been exploited due to the Canada-US FTA from 1989. This
could be captured in our framework with a gravity specication that allows for pair-specic NAFTA eects,
where we can estimate dierential partial equilibrium eects of NAFTA across member countries. However,
we chose to use a common estimate of the direct NAFTA eect in order to emphasize the methodological
contribution of our framework by comparing results across alternative scenarios.
  41 We can demonstrate that the real GDP changes are mostly driven by factory-gate price changes, while
the changes in the multilateral resistances are in the expected direction but are relatively small.




                                                     38
for NAFTA members in this scenario are comparable to estimates from related studies (see


Anderson and Yotov, 2011; Caliendo and Parro, 2015).


   Turning to the eects on non-member countries, the additional general equilibrium forces


in this scenario lead to larger losses for non-members, but the losses are still very small.


The only three countries for which we obtain losses that are larger than one percent are


Argentina, Colombia, and Guatemala.      Overall, our results indicate signicant additional


general equilibrium eects when moving from the Conditional GE to the Full Static GE


scenario. However, similar to the conditional eects, we nd that the additional eects in the


Full Static GE are large and positive for members (about 2.5 percentage points on average)


and negative, but small for non-members (about 0.15 percentage points on average).


   Column (4) of Table 3 reports estimates from our Full Dynamic GE, SS scenario, which


captures the capital accumulation eects of NAFTA by comparing the initial steady-state


(SS) with the new steady-state, where all capital is fully adjusted to take into account


the introduction of NAFTA. Focusing on the NAFTA countries, we see doubling of the


NAFTA eects on welfare via the dynamic capital accumulation forces in our framework. The


additional dynamic gains are on average almost 6 percentage points. The dynamic eects on


non-members are negative, but small in absolute value and also small as a percentage change


of the static eects.   Overall, the estimates from column (4) reveal signicant additional


benets for members on average (about 5.7 percentage points), small additional negative


eects for non-members (1.3 percentage points), and an overall eciency gain for the world


of 2.7 percentage points.


   Thus far, we follow the standard in the trade literature to measure welfare as real GDP


(see ACR for example).      However, our dynamic capital-accumulation framework requires


an alternative approach to measure welfare eects for the following reasons: (i) Transition


between steady states is not immediate due to the gradual adjustment of capital stocks.


Given our `upper level' equilibrium, we are able to solve the transition path for capital

accumulation simultaneously in each of the                    N -countries        in our sample.        (ii) Consumers in


our setting divide their income between consumption and investment. Thus, only part of


GDP is used to derive utility. In order to account for these features of our model, we follow


Lucas (1987) and calculate the constant fraction                      λ    of aggregate consumption in each year


that consumers would need to be paid in the baseline case to give them the same utility they


obtain from the consumption stream in the counterfactual. Specically, we calculate:
                  ∞                       ∞                                   

    Properly discounted welfare eects are reported in column (5) labeled Full Dynamic


GE, trans. of Table 3, where the label `trans.' reects the fact that this scenario takes the


transition into account and discounts. As expected, the dynamic welfare eects on member


and non-member countries are smaller as compared to the welfare changes from column (4).


Importantly, they are still signicantly larger as compared to the Full Static GE eects


from column (3). Specically, the discounted dynamic eects increase the welfare for NAFTA


members by more than 2.6 percentage points. The negative eects of non-members increase


by only 0.06 percentage points.


    An important feature of our work is the ability to characterize the eects of trade liber-


alization on capital accumulation and the transition between steady states. Figure 2 depicts


the transition path for capital stocks in four countries from our sample. These countries in-


clude all NAFTA members plus Guatemala. The latter is chosen because, according to our


model, this is the outside country that experiences the strongest negative impact of NAFTA.


    Figure 2 reveals that the eects on NAFTA members are large and long-lived.                                          The


largest eect of 60 percent increase in capital stock is for Canada, followed by 33 percent

  42 Given our closed-form solution of the policy function for capital and an initial capital stock             K0 , this boils
down to solving our system given by equations (19)-(24) for all countries at each point of time. Alternatively,
we used Dynare (http://www.dynare.org/) and the implied rst-order conditions of our dynamic system to
solve the transition path. Both lead to identical results. For further details on the calculation of the transition
see Online Appendix C.



                                                              40

for Mexico and 4 percent for U.S.                     Most of the dynamic gains accrue initially, but there


remain signicant transitional dynamic gains more than 100 years after the formation of


NAFTA. In contrast, our results suggest that the transitional eects on non-members are


small and relatively short-lived. On average we nd that capital stock in the non-member


countries would have been about 0.5 percent lower without NAFTA, ranging between -1.99

                                                                        44
percent for Guatemala to -0.08 percent for Switzerland.                       According to Figure 2, the negative


eects on Guatemala vanish about 50 years after the implementation of NAFTA. However,


we estimate that on average non-members reach a new steady-state after about 10 years


after the formation of NAFTA. In combination, the large and long-lived dynamic eects


of NAFTA for members and the small and relatively short-lived eects for non-members


constitute encouraging evidence in support of trade liberalization and integration eorts.


    A second counterfactual experiment sheds more light on the eects of trade on growth

                                                                       1−σ

                                                                       ij     for all    i 6= j   by 38% (the estimate


of the eects of globalization over a period of 12 years from Bergstrand, Larch, and Yotov,

         45
2013).        The globalization eects in the four scenarios of columns (2)-(5) are presented in


columns (6)-(9) of Table 3. All countries in the world benet from globalization. Intuitively,


through lowering trade costs globalization improves eciency in the world, and since bilateral


trade costs decrease for every country, the eciency gains are shared among all countries


too.   Second, the benets vary across countries with the biggest gains to relatively small

  43 The large increase in the capital stock for Canada is explained similarly as the large welfare gain for
that country (see footnote 40).
  44 The net negative eect on non-members is the result of three forces: i) Trade diversion due to NAFTA
leads to increased trade resistance which translates into higher producer and consumer prices in the non-
member countries; ii) At the same time, improved eciency in NAFTA members would lead to trade creation
between NAFTA and non-NAFTA members and lower the consumer prices in the latter; iii) Finally, larger
income in NAFTA members will lead to more imports for those countries from all other countries in the
world. The fact that we obtain negative net eects of capital accumulation in all our non-member countries
reveals that the rst, trade diversion, eect dominates the latter two, trade creation, eects. In principle, it
is possible for the trade creation eect to dominate the negative impact of trade liberalization. For example,
using sectoral-level data in an endowment setting Anderson and Yotov (2011) oer evidence of decreasing
consumer prices in outside countries due to trade liberalization and specialization. The dynamic channels
in our framework could magnify these specialization eects which points to the benets of extending our
framework to the sectoral-level. We leave this valuable extension for future work.
  45 With our estimated   σ   of   5.1,   this corresponds to a decrease of   tij   by 7.56% for all   i 6= j .

countries in close proximity to large markets. For example, Canada and Mexico are among


the big winners in all scenarios. Third, comparison between the Full Static GE scenario


and the Conditional GE scenario reveal that the additional general equilibrium forces in the


Full Static GE case lead on average to doubling of the gains. Finally, we estimate strong


dynamic eects of globalization. The Full Static GE gains double in the Full Dynamic


GE, SS scenario, and they increase by more than 50% in the dynamic scenario which takes


the transition into account and discounts.




5.2 Alternative Specications and Robustness Analysis
In this section we oer a brief summary of a series of robustness experiments that we per-


formed in order to gauge the sensitivity of the results from our NAFTA counterfactual to


relaxing some important theoretical assumptions and to employing alternative values for the


key structural parameters in our model. We oer a detailed description and results for each


experiment in Appendix A.


   In our rst experiment, we replace the log-linear (Cobb-Douglas) capital transition func-


tion with the standard linear form:     Kj,t+1 = Ωj,t + (1 − δ)Kj,t .   The main (and only)


implication for our theory is that the equation for capital accumulation in system (19)-(24)


is replaced by a standard consumption Euler-equation. Thus, our growth-and-trade system


no longer has a closed-form solution and it does not lend itself to the iterative methods that


we used for our main counterfactual. Therefore, in order to simulate the eects of NAFTA


in the new setting, we now rely on Dynare, which is a standard tool to solve dynamic general


equilibrium and overlapping generations models. For consistency with the main analysis, we


employ the same data and parameters. Figure 3 summarizes our ndings by comparing the


transition paths for capital accumulation with the linear and with the log-linear transition


function for the four countries that we presented in Figure 2. Overall, the eects are similar.


Three ndings stand out. First, the capital accumulation eects generated with the linear


transition function are more pronounced immediately after the implementation of NAFTA




                                              42
both for member and for non-member countries. Second, the dynamic NAFTA eects are


exhausted a bit faster with the linear capital accumulation function.               Third, we nd that


the welfare eects obtained with the linear versus the log-linear capital transition function


are very similar. Thus, we conclude that replacing the standard linear capital accumulation


function with its analytically convenient log-linear counterpart has little implications for the


level of welfare.     However, the linear capital accumulation function increases the speed of


convergence. Estimation results and more detailed analysis of this experiment are presented


in Appendix A.2.


    In order to highlight the importance of the capital accumulation channel, which is the


vehicle for the dynamic eects in our model, we investigate how the eects of NAFTA will


change if capital stock in the U.S. were 20% larger. Estimates that we present in Table 7


of Appendix A.3 reveal the following.          First, the largest increase in welfare is seen in the


U.S. (about 6.6%). Second, we nd that all other countries gain as well. In particular, the


positive eects of NAFTA on Canada and Mexico are magnied, while the negative eects


on all other countries in the world are diminished. Finally, we nd that eects of increased


U.S. capital base for the United States and for all other countries are more persistent and


fade only slowly over time. In sum, this experiment demonstrates that capital accumulation


is an important channel for the level of welfare, but even more so for the persistence of


welfare eects for members and non-members over time.

                                                     46
    The important role of intermediate goods              is well-documented in the static trade liter-

         47
ature.        In our next experiment, we study the dynamic implications of intermediate goods.


We model intermediates in the spirit of Eaton and Kortum (2002) while retaining all other


theoretical assumptions in our model. (See Appendix A.4 for details.) The introduction of

  46 Intermediate inputs represent more than half of the goods imported by the developed economies and
close to three-quarters of the imports of some large developing countries, such as China and Brazil (Ali and
Dadush, 2011). International production fragmentation and international value chains are less pronounced
in some sectors, such as agriculture (Johnson and Noguera, 2012), but extreme in others, e.g. high tech
products such as computers (Kraemer and Dedrick, 2002), iPods (Varian, 2007) and aircrafts (Grossman
and Rossi-Hansberg, 2012).

intermediate goods adds a new layer of general equilibrium linkages that shape the relation-


ship between growth and trade. First, the eect of changes in the price of own capital on


capital accumulation and the eect of own capital accumulation on trade and welfare are


magnied because, via the intermediates, own capital enters the production function also


indirectly.   Second, the introduction of intermediates opens a new channel through which


foreign capital enters domestic production and the policy function for domestic capital. This


new channel is important because it may transmit positive capital accumulation eects in


liberalizing countries to non-members. Third, since foreign goods are used as intermediates,


any change in their prices will have further eect on domestic capital accumulation. We nd


support for our theoretical predictions in Table 7 of Appendix A.4, where we see that the


introduction of intermediates magnies disproportionately the eects of NAFTA for member


countries relative to non-members.


   We nish with ve experiments that document the sensitivity of our results to changes


in the key model parameters. First, we allow for country-specic capital depreciation rates,


which are obtained as discussed in Section 4.3.3. Our ndings, presented in Appendix A.5,


reveal that, all else equal, higher depreciation rates lead to more trade and higher welfare.


The intuition is that, due to lower prices resulting from trade liberalization, more foreign


goods are demanded for capital replacement and consumption, which leads to more trade


and higher welfare. The opposite happens for lower depreciation rates. Next, we experiment


with values for the trade elasticity of substitution.   As expected, we nd that a higher   σ
leads to lower welfare eects.   This is intuitive because a higher   σ   means that consumers


do not value the availability of foreign goods a lot. Third, we increase the share of capital


in production. This reinforces the dynamic eects in our model by magnifying the positive


eects for NAFTA members and by mitigating the negative impact on non-members. Fourth,


we set the value of the consumer discount factor to     β = 0.95,   which is the value used in


Eaton, Kortum, Neiman, and Romalis (2015). The lower consumer discount factor results


in smaller, but still relatively large, dynamic eects on welfare. This result is expected and




                                              44
is a reection of the fact that a smaller     β   means that consumers value the future stream


of consumption less.       Finally, we lower the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of one


(implied by our logarithmic utility function) to 0.5 using an iso-elastic utility function for


instantaneous utility. A lower willingness to change the consumption-investment-decision to


changes in prices over time leads to slower adjustment to the new steady-state with higher


levels of consumption in the rst years after the shock. This leads to slightly higher dynamic


welfare gains. In sum, we nd that our results are sensitive to the specication of the key


parameters, but the model generates intuitive responses to parameter changes.



6      Conclusions

The simplicity of the dynamic structural gravity model derives from severe abstraction: each


country produces one good only and there is no international lending or borrowing. Dicult


but important extensions of the model entail relaxing each restriction while preserving the


closed-form solution for accumulation. This may be feasible because either relaxation implies


a contemporaneous allocation of investment across sectors and/or countries with an equi-


librium that can nest in the inter-temporal allocation of the dynamic model. A multi-good


model will bring in the important force of specialization. An international borrowing model


will bring in another dynamic channel magnifying dierential growth rates. Success in the


extension can quantify how important these forces are.

Notes:          This table reports results from three specications of the production
function. The number of observations is 1606 and all specications include coun-
try and year xed eects whose estimates are omitted for brevity. Column (1)
reports estimates from a standard constrained estimation of the Cobb-Douglas
production function. In column (2), we estimate a Frankel-and-Romer-type in-
come regression. Finally, in column (3) we estimate our structural model. Robust
(in column (1)) and robust, bootstrapped (in columns (2) and (3)) standard errors
in parentheses. +            p < 0.10,     *   p < .05,      **   p < .01.   See text for further details.

Notes    : This table reports results from our NAFTA and globalization counterfactual. It is based
on observed data on labor endowments and GDPs for our sample of 82 countries. Further, it uses
our estimated trade costs based on equation (32) and recovered theory-consistent, steady-state
capital stocks according to equation (25). We calculate baseline preference-adjusted technology
Aj /γj   according to the market-clearing equation (22) and the production function equation (23).
Finally, the counterfactual is based on our own estimates of the elasticity of substitution               σ
                                                                                                          b =
5.1,   the share of capital in the Cobb-Douglas production function                 αb = 0.55, and the capital
depreciation rate      δb = 0.052.   The consumers' discount factor     β   is   set equal to 0.98. Column (1)
gives the country abbreviations. Columns (2) to (5) report the percentage change in welfare for
our NAFTA counterfactual for each country, for the world as a whole, the NAFTA and the non-
NAFTA countries (summarized as Rest Of the World, ROW) for three dierent scenarios. The
Conditional GE scenario takes the direct and indirect trade cost changes into account but holds
GDPs constant, the Full Static GE scenario additionally takes general equilibrium income eects
into account, and the Full Dynamic GE scenario adds the capital accumulation eects. For the
latter, we report the results from the steady-state not taking into account that gains take time to
materialize (column (4)), and the welfare gains taking into account the transition (column (5)).
Columns (6) to (9) report the percentage change in welfare for each country for the same three
scenarios for our globalization counterfactual, where we assume that international trade costs for
all countries decrease by 38%.

A     Appendix: Robustness Checks and Sensitivity Exper-

      iments

This Appendix oers a series of sensitivity experiments that gauge the robustness of our
results. First, we report alternative specications of the    Income equation   and the   Capital
equation,   which identify causal relationships between trade, income and capital accumula-
tion and also deliver some of the key parameters in our model. Then, we oer details for
the robustness checks that we summarized in Section 5.2 of the main text. We start by re-
placing the convenient log-linear capital accumulation function with a more standard linear
counterpart. Then, we investigate the eect on NAFTA dynamics of an exogenous increase
of the capital stock for the U.S. Third, we repeat the NAFTA counterfactual in the model
extended to allow for intermediate goods. Finally, we experiment with dierent values for
the key parameters in our model including country-specic depreciation rates, followed by
alternative values for the elasticity of substitution, and for the capital share.



A.1 Estimating Equations for Income and Capital
This section provides the additional tables for our sensitivity experiments for the       Income
equation    and the   Capital equation   that we discuss in the corresponding sections from the
main text. Table 4 provides additional results for the     Income equation   when estimating it
without imposing the theoretical restrictions on the coecients. As noted in the main text,
our ndings are qualitatively identical and quantitatively very similar. Table 5 allows for
heterogeneous eects of capital shares over time and across country-groups. In accordance
with our expectations, the estimates from Table 5 reveal that, on average, capital shares
have increased over time and also that production in rich countries is more capital intensive.
Table 6 introduces employment as an additional variable in our        Capital equation    in order
to isolate the eects of factory-gate prices on capital accumulation.      The main nding is
that the estimate on the value of output, which now proxies exclusively for the eects of
factory-gate prices, is still positive and statistically signicant as predicted by our theory.



A.2 Linear Capital Transition Function
The nice tractability feature of obtaining a closed-form solution for the eects of trade
(openness) on capital accumulation in our framework depends crucially on the assumption
of a log-linear (Cobb-Douglas) transition function for capital. In this section, we study the
limitations of this assumption by replacing the log-linear capital transition function with the
standard linear capital transition function:


                                   Kj,t+1 = Ωj,t + (1 − δ)Kj,t .




                                                 57

Two main features of the new system stand out. First, the only dierence between systems
(48)-(53) and (19)-(24) is equation (53), which replaces the closed-form solution (24) for the
link between trade and capital accumulation in the original system. Second, as expected,
equation (53) no longer represents an analytical expression for next period capital stocks,
but rather an implicit relationship that determines consumption. In fact, (53) is the stan-
dard consumption Euler-equation, where we have a set of three forward-looking endogenous
variables for each country {yt ,         Ct ,   and    Pt }.49
    System (48)-(53) no longer lends itself to the iterative method that we used to perform
the counterfactuals of interest. Therefore, we rely on Dynare, which is a standard tool to
                                                                                                         50
solve dynamic general equilibrium and overlapping generations models.                                         For consistency
with the main analysis, we employ the same data and parameters to simulate the eects
                              51
of NAFTA once again.               To demonstrate the changes due to the new capital accumulation
function, we rst focus on the transition of capital stocks.                           As introduced in Section 5.2,
Figure 3 contrasts the transition paths for the four countries that we presented in Figure
2, obtained with the log-linear transition functions, against the corresponding transitions
functions for the same countries but this time obtained with the linear capital transition
function.
    Figure 3 reveals the following.                  Overall, the eects are similar.           Two dierences stand

       t+1 is determined in t and therefore not a forward-looking variable.

  51 Note that (48)-(53) implies that the estimating equations for trade and output remain unchanged.
Therefore, our estimates of the RTA eects, of trade costs,          tij ,   of the capital share   α,   and of the elasticity of
substitution   σ   can be estimated as before and remain unchanged. The only parameter that we can no longer
estimate is the capital depreciation rate       δ.   However, since our estimate of      δ = 0.05    is plausible, we retain it
in the robustness experiment. Note also that, without the closed-form solution for capital accumulation, we
can no longer test for causal eects of trade on capital accumulation.

out. First, the capital accumulation eects generated with the linear transition function are
more pronounced immediately after the implementation of NAFTA both for member and
for non-member countries.         Second, the linear capital accumulation function implies that
the dynamic eects of NAFTA are exhausted a bit faster.           For example, we see that for
Canada the system with the linear capital transition function converges about 115 years
after NAFTA, while the system with the log-linear capital accumulation converges in about
150 years.
   While the quantitative eects on transition of capital seem dierent, we hardly nd any
dierence between the welfare eects obtained with the linear versus the log-linear capital
transition function. The welfare eects from both cases are reported in Table 7. In the rst
column we give the country names, the second column reproduces the welfare results from
our baseline Full Dynamic GE, transition scenario (column (5) of Table 3). The welfare
results for the case with the linear capital accumulation function are reported in column (3).
Comparing columns (2) and (3) reveals that the welfare eects are qualitatively identical
and quantitatively very similar for the case with our analytical tractable log-linear capital
transition function and the more standard linear one. For example, the predicted welfare
increases for NAFTA members change from 7.671% in the log-linear case to 7.669% in the
linear case, while the ones for the non-members change from -0.423% to -0.403%, respectively.
Thus, we conclude that replacing the standard linear capital accumulation function with its
analytically convenient log-linear counterpart has little implications for the level of welfare.
However, the linear capital accumulation function increases the speed of convergence.



A.3 Exogenous Growth
The main mechanism that leads to dynamic eects in our framework is through capital
accumulation. We therefore want to highlight how an exogenous change in the initial stock
of capital inuences trade and welfare of countries in our framework. In order to demonstrate
the capital accumulation channel, we investigate how the eects of NAFTA will change if,
in the presence of NAFTA, the capital stock in the U.S. would be 20% larger.
   The welfare results for the counterfactual of an increase of the U.S. capital stock of
20% are presented in column (4) of Table 7. First, as we would have expected, the largest
increase in welfare is seen in the U.S.: if the formation of NAFTA was accompanied by a
20% increase of the capital stock in the U.S., welfare in the U.S. would increase by about
6.6%. The dierence between the baseline given in column (2) is about 4 percentage points.
All other countries gain as well.      In particular, the positive eects of NAFTA on Canada
and Mexico are magnied, while the negative eects on all other countries in the world are
diminished. Note that these large eects for the U.S. itself and the relatively small positive
eects for the other countries fade only slowly over time.
   In sum, we see that capitU.S.al accumulation is very important for the level of welfare in
our framework, but even more important for the persistence of the welfare eects over time.
The spill-over eects for non-member countries are relatively small, but the persistence of
the spill-over eects is large.

A.4 Intermediate Goods
Intermediate inputs represent more than half of the goods imported by the developed
economies and close to three-quarters of the imports of some large developing countries, such
as China and Brazil (Ali and Dadush, 2011). International production fragmentation and
international value chains are less pronounced in some sectors, such as agriculture (Johnson
and Noguera, 2012), but extreme in others, e.g. high tech products such as computers (Krae-
mer and Dedrick, 2002), iPods (Varian, 2007) and aircrafts (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg,
2012). Trade models recognize the important role of intermediate goods for production and
                                                                         52
trade and introduce intermediates within static settings.                     In this section we contribute to
the related literature by studying the implications of intermediate goods for the dynamic
relationships between growth and trade.
    To introduce intermediates within our aggregate framework, we follow the approach of
Eaton and Kortum (2002) and we assume that intermediate inputs are combined with labor
                                                                                  53
and capital via the following Cobb-Douglas-production function:

dened as a CES aggregator of domestic components (qjj,t ) and imported components from
all other regions   i 6= j (qij,t ).
    Following the steps from our theoretical analysis in Section 3, we obtain the following sys-
tem that describes the relationship between growth and trade in the presence of intermediate

  52 See for example Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Caliendo and Parro (2015).
  53 We recognize that the use of intermediates vary signicantly at the sectoral level as well as across
domestic and international inputs, but we leave the dynamic sectoral analysis for future work.

The introduction of intermediate goods adds a new layer of indirect and general equilib-
rium linkages that shape the relationship between growth and trade. Equation (59) captures
two additional eects of growth on trade, which are channeled through intermediate inputs.
First, the eect of own capital accumulation on trade is magnied because           Kj,t   enters the
production function (59) directly, as before, and indirectly, via the intermediates        Qj,t .    Sec-
ond, and more important, the introduction of intermediates opens a new channel through
which foreign capital and foreign capital accumulation enter domestic production (via               Qj,t ).
This is an important new link because a change in domestic production will lead to changes
in the demand for intermediates from all countries, which also aects trade.
   Equation (61) captures three new channels through which trade aects growth in the
case of intermediates.    First, the eect of a change in the price of own capital on capital
accumulation is magnied because own capital enters the policy function for capital directly,
as before, and indirectly, via the intermediate inputs. Second, foreign capital and foreign
capital accumulation now enter the policy function for domestic capital via the intermediate
inputs. Finally, since foreign goods are used as intermediates and enter equation (61), any
change in their prices will have further eects on domestic capital accumulation.
   We are not aware of the existence of international data on the use of intermediate goods
at the aggregate level. This makes it impossible to disentangle the shares of labor, capital
and intermediates in our Cobb-Douglas production function (54) empirically. Therefore, we
adopt Eaton and Kortum's (2002) approach and assume a share for intermediates, which
                                                1−σ
we combine with our data for Lj,t , yj,t , and tij,t as well as the estimated parameters, to
recover the country-specic technological components Aj /γj . Specically, we assign a share
of intermediates equal to      0.25 at the expensive of capital, and we retain the share of labor to

0.45   as in our baseline setting.         Then, we replicate our NAFTA counterfactual experiment
to quantify the role of intermediates in our dynamic framework.
   Column (5) of Table 7 presents the results after allowing for intermediates. Several prop-
erties stand out in comparison with the baseline setting from column (2). First, accounting
for intermediates in production increases the welfare eects for NAFTA members by 1.2
percentage points on average. For example, Canada's welfare increases by about 6 percent-
age points. This increase is exclusively due to the interaction between intermediate inputs
and the dynamic forces in our framework. Very similar additional quantitative implications
are found for Mexico and the U.S. even though the U.S. welfare gains are smaller, which
is in accordance with the smaller baseline setting gains for the largest member of NAFTA.
Second, we nd that the negative eects on non-member countries are also larger. The neg-
ative impact of NAFTA on non-members increases by 0.035 percentage points on average.
Importantly, we note that the additional negative eect on non-members is not only smaller
as compared to the additional gain for members in absolute value, but also as percent (8.3
percent vs. 15.6 percent). The intuition for this result is that the positive spill-over eects
of capital accumulation in member countries that are channeled via the intermediate goods
in non-member countries partly oset the negative trade diversion eect in the latter.
   In sum, the analysis of the framework with intermediates demonstrates that the intro-
duction of intermediate goods leads to signicant changes in the quantitative predictions of
our model. The aggregate nature of our study and lack of appropriate data are limiting our
analysis. However, our ndings point to clear potential benets from a more detailed anal-
ysis of the dynamic eects of intermediate inputs and to additional insights and knowledge
to be gained from an extension of our model to the sectoral level.



A.5 Sensitivity to Structural Parameter Values
In this section we investigate the sensitivity of our results with respect to key parameters
of our model.      In our rst experiment we allow for country-specic capital depreciation
rates, which are reported in column (6) of Table 7. The welfare eects of NAFTA in the
presence of the country-specic           δ 's   are reported in column (7). As some      δ 's   are lower and
some are higher, an overall statement is dicult. In general, a higher                δ   implies that more
capital has to be replaced in every period. This is a burden for an economy. However, the
price for the replacement depends on the price for the nal good. Lowering trade costs, as
is done by the conclusion of NAFTA, leads to a lower price for the composite nal good.
This decrease in the nal goods price is driven by the direct eect of lower trade costs,
leading to lower prices for foreign goods, and due to the larger share of foreign goods used in
production. Hence, trade liberalization makes capital replacement cheaper. All else equal,
a higher depreciation rate implies that international trade increases, as more foreign goods
are demanded for capital replacement and consumption due to the lower price. Also welfare
increases as compared to the baseline, as the higher depreciation rate implies a larger role for
the capital accumulation channel inducing income growth. The eects of trade liberalization
are exactly in the opposite direction for a lower depreciation rate.                  For non-liberalizing

  55 Introducing intermediates at the expensive of capital will enable us to demonstrate the dierence between
capital goods and intermediates in our dynamic framework.




                                                         62
countries, the negative eects will become stronger for higher             δ 's   and weaker for lower     δ 's
due to the same logic. Take for example Zimbabwe, which is the country with the highest
capital depreciation rate,    δ = 0.161.   In our baseline we assume a      δ = 0.052.     Hence, we would
expect higher welfare losses for Zimbabwe, which is indeed the case. The opposite happens
for China, which is the country with the smallest capital depreciation rate,                δ = 0.03.
    Next, we employ extreme values for the key parameters in our model. In column (8) of
Table 7 we use our largest estimate of   σ = 7.998. As expected, a higher σ leads to lower
welfare eects. This is the case because σ directly governs the willingness of consumers to
substitute products. A higher σ therefore leads to lower gains from trade, as consumers
do not value the availability of foreign goods a lot. On average, the increase of σ from 5.1
to 7.998 leads to a decrease of the welfare eects of about 40%. Next, we set α = 0.391,
which is the lowest of our capital shares estimates. As expected, the decrease of the capital
share mitigates the dynamic eects in our model.              This leads to about 15% lower welfare
gains for the NAFTA countries as compared to the baseline setting (compare column (2)
and column (9) of Table 7). The negative eects on non-NAFTA countries are smaller but
disproportionately so. This suggests that, combined with trade liberalization, more intensive
use of capital will lead to relatively more gains for member countries.
    We nish with two experiments involving the external parameters                  β   (the subjective dis-
                                                                                             56
count factor) and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, respectively.                     Specically,
we set the value of the consumer discount factor to             β = 0.95,    which is the value used in
Eaton, Kortum, Neiman, and Romalis (2015). The lower consumer discount factor results
in smaller, but still relatively large, dynamic eects on welfare. The estimates from column
(10) of Table 7 reveal that the dynamic welfare gains for NAFTA members decrease by
about 22%, while the negative eects on non-members are 15% smaller. The overall smaller
dynamic eects that correspond to a smaller discount factor are expected because they re-
ect the fact that a smaller     β   means that consumers value the future stream of consumption
less. Concerning the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, we change it from one to 0.5,
a value supported by empirical ndings (see Sampson, 2014). A lower willingness to change
the consumption-investment-decision when relative prices over time changes leads to slightly
larger additional dynamic welfare gains. The reason is that a lower intertemporal elasticity
of substitution leads to a slower adjustment to the new steady-state, implying that there
is a higher level of consumption in early years. In combination with discounting of future
consumption, this leads to a slightly higher overall dynamic welfare gain.
    In sum, we nd that our results are sensitive to the specication of the key parameters,
but the model generates intuitive responses to parameter changes.




  56 Note that our logarithmic utility function implies an intertemporal elasticity of substitution of 1. In
Appendix J we generalize our logarithmic intertemporal utility function to an iso-elastic utility function.

Notes: This table reports results from various specications of the production function.                                       The
number of observations is 1606 and all specications include country and year xed eects whose
estimates are omitted for brevity. Column (1) reports estimates from a standard unconstrained
estimation of the Cobb-Douglas production function. In column (2), we impose the theoretical
constraint that the coecients of               ln Lj,t   and   ln Kj,t   should add up to one.    In column (3), we

Notes    : This table reports robustness results for our NAFTA counterfactual. It is based on observed data on
labor endowments and GDPs for our sample of 82 countries. Further, it uses our estimated trade costs based
on equation (32) and recovered theory-consistent, steady-state capital stocks according to equation (25).
We calculate baseline preference-adjusted technology           Aj /γj   according to the market-clearing equation (22)
and the production function equation (23). Finally, the counterfactual is based on our own estimates of the
elasticity of substitution    σ
                              b = 5.1, the share of capital in the Cobb-Douglas production function α
                                                                                                    b = 0.55, and
the capital depreciation rate     δb = 0.052. The consumers' discount factor β is set equal to 0.98. Only welfare
eects for the `Full Dynamic GE, trans.' scenario are reported. Column (1) gives the country abbreviations.
Columns (2) reports for reasons of comparison the results from our baseline setting reported in column (5)
in Table 3. Column (3) is based on the linear instead of the log-linear capital transition function. Column
(4) assumes a 20% higher capital stock in U.S. in 1994 when NAFTA was concluded. Column (5) gives the
results when allowing for intermediate inputs. Column (6) gives the estimated country-specic depreciation
rates   δi ,   while Column (7) reports the corresponding welfare eects of NAFTA based on these depreciation
rates. Column (8) is based on an elasticity of substitution of           σ
                                                                         b = 7.998         instead of   5.1,    column (9) reports
results based on a capital share of      α
                                         b = 0.391,      the lowest value obtained in our estimates, instead of              0.55.
Column (10) changes the subjective discount factor from               0.98   to    0.95,   while the last column changes the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution from one (implied by our logarithmic utility function for instantaneous
utility) to 0.5 (=1/ρ) using an iso-elastic utility function for instantaneous utility.
