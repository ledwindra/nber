TOBIN'S Q, CORPORATE
DIVERSIFICATION
AND FIRM PERFORMANCE

ABSTRACT

In this paper, we show that Tobin's q and firm diversification are negatively related. This
negative relation holds for different diversification measures and when we control for other
known determinants of q. We show further that diversified firms have lower q's than equivalent

portfolios of specialized firms. This negative relation holds throughout the 1980s in our sample.

Finally, it holds for firms that have kept their number of segments constant over a number of

years as well as for firms that have not. In our sample, firms that increase their number of
segments have lower q's than firms that keep their number of segment constant. Our evidence

is consistent with the view that firms seek growth through diversification when they have
exhausted internal growth opportunities. We fail to find evidence supportive of the view that
diversification provides firms with a valuable intangible asset.

SectIon 1. IntroductIon.
When do shareholders benefit from firm diversification? Coase's answer is that the
boundary of the firm should be at the point where "the costs of organizing an extra transaction
within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction by means of an

exchange in the open market or the costs of organizing in another firm" (Coase (1937)). As
pointed out by Williamson (1981) and others, this answer requires an operational definition of
transaction costs.

Depending on one's view of transaction costs, one can look at a firm and find it either
efficiently organized or not. For instance, the 1960s and 1970s view of conglomerates often was

that they can operate unrelated businesses more efficiently than these businesses could be
operated as stand-alone units, possibly by organizing an internal capital market that is more
efficient in allocating resources than external markets.' In contrast, in the 1980s the view that
conglomerates survive only because the high costs associated with corporate control transactions

prevent active investors from acquiring these companies and dividing them up gained substantial
ground among economists.2

In this paper, rather than pursuing an analysis of transaction costs, we investigate whether

the market's valuation of a firm is correlated with its degree of diversification. Although there is
a substantial literature that compares diversified firms to specialized firms, this literature has not
reached a decisive conclusion because its results are sensitive to the measures used to perform

the comparisons, to how these measures are normalized to facilitate comparisons across firms,

See Weston (1970) and Williamson (1970) for the financing argument. Chandler (1977) and

others have advanced arguments suggesting that the M-form of organization used by multidivisional firms inherently makes firms more efficient.

and to the starting dates of the comparisons.3 By focusing on the present value of cash flows at

a point in time normalized by the replacement cost of tangible assets, Tobins q, rather than on
performance over time, we avoid some of the problems of the earlier literature. In addition, our
valuation perspective permits us to carry out LeBaron and Speidell's (1989) "chop-shop" approach

and to compare the Tobin's q of diversified firms to the Tobin's q of comparable portfolios of
specialized firms. If the stand-alone q of divisions of conglomerates is well-approximated by the
q of specialized firms in the same industry, the "chop-shop" approach provides an estimate of the
benefit from splitting a conglomerate into stand-alone divisions.

Recent studies focus on the contribution to firm value of changes in the degree of
diversification. Specifically, Morck, Shleifer and Vishny (1990) show that the market reacts
negatively to unrelated acquisitions during the 1980s but not during the 1970s. More recently,

Comment and Jarrell (1993) investigate the effect of changes in firm focus directly and
demonstrate that the value of firms increases during periods when they become more focused.
In this paper, we provide evidence that complements these studies. By investigating the relation

between q and the degree of diversification at a point in time, we can investigate the relative
efficiency of diversified firms even if these firms do not change their degree of diversification.
Such an inquiry can yield important insights in the interpretation of the stock return studies that

focus on changes in firms' degree of diversification because it could be that firms that change
their degree of diversification are firms that failed in their diversification efforts in contrast to firms
that do not change their degree of diversification.4

If diversification does not contribute to value, one would expect the Tobin's q of a

reviews of the literature.

failures.

diversified firm to simply be the Tobin's q of an equivalent portfolio of specialized firms. If
diversification contributes value, it should be as an intangible organizational asset that increases

market value relative to replacement cost. We find the opposite result. Through the late 1970s
and the 1980s, single-industry firms are valued more highly by the capital markets than diversified

firms. Further, highly diversified firms (defined as those firms that report sales for five segments
or more) have both a mean and a median Tobin's q below the sample average for each year in
our sample. Hence, conglomerates are not even average firms in terms of q.

After showing that the Tobin's q of diversified firms is lower, we investigate whether this
relation between q and the degree of diversification can be explained by industry effects. It could

be that diversified firms are concentrated in industries with fewer growth opportunities. We
account for industry effects by constructing portfolios of specialized firms that match the industry

composition of diversified firms. We find that industry effects account for a significant fraction of
the diversification discount. Yet, after correcting for industry effects, the diversification discount
is positive and significant every year in our sample. Our industry-adjusted approach provides an

estimate of the Tobin's q a diversified firm would have if its divisions were not part of a
conglomerate and were valued like the average firm in their 3-digit SIC code. It follows from our
results that shareholder wealth would increase on average if diversified firms could be dismantled

in such a way that each division would have the average q of specialized firms in its industry.

Since ind.istry effects do not explain the diversification discount, we investigate whether
the result that diversified firms are valued less than specialized firms could be explained by other

variables commonly used to explain q besides a firm's industry. We find that the result holds up

if we control for size, for access to capital markets and R&D intensity. We also find that our

results are robust if we restrict the sample to firms that have not changed their number of

3

segments for at least the five previous years and if we exclude firms with large q's.5

Though we control for access to capital markets and find that it does not explain our
results, it could still be that conglomerates allocate capital more efficiently than specialized firms

because of their ability to operate an internal capital market that does not suffer from the
informational asymmetries that affect the cost of capital on external markets. To see this,suppose

that informational asymmetries between firms and outside investors increase the cost of capital.
In this case, diversified firms could provide funds more cheaply than external markets to divisions

that would face high informational asymmetries when dealing with outside investors. This cost of

capital advantage would enable these divisions to use up growth opportunities that specialized

firms with a higher cost of capital would have to leave unused. This argument suggests that
conglomerates could have lower q's than specialized firms. If this ability to mitigate informational

asymmetries is the main advantage of conglomerates, however, it should be part of the present

value of their future cash flows. For these firms, the ability to exploit growth opportunities that

cannot be captured by specialized firms would be capitalized in their market value whereas
specialized firms would be discounted because of the constraints they face in taking advantage

of growth opportunities, On balance, therefore, this greater efficiency of conglomerates should
translate itself into a higher average q if properly incorporated in firm value by the capital markets.

One issue we cannot address directly is the issue of potential reporting biases. The data we
use, namely Compustat's Industry Segment File, is constructed by Compustat from information

reported by firms. Firms have some latitude in how they choose to report their number of
segments. It could be, therefore, that firms choose to report more segments when they are doing
poorly. We find evidence, however, that contradicts this possible bias. In particular, firms that start

reporting fewer segments do not have higher q's than the firms that keep their number of
segments constant. Lindenberg (1991) discusses some reporting biases in the Compustat
Segment File. The data we use seems to have fewer biases than the one he analyzes because
in his analysis, he had access to a subset of what we use. His data does not include firms
dropped from the Compustat Segment File whereas ours does.
See Fazzan, Hubbard and Peterson (1988), for instance, for a detailed discussion.

4

It therefore seems inconsistent with the low average and median q's of the highly diversified firms
in our Sample.

Although we believe that our evidence leads to the conclusion that there is a negative
relation between q and diversification, the reason for this relation does not appear to be that good

firms diversify and therefore become bad firms. In our sample, there is some evidence that firms

that add segments are firms with lower q's relative to other specialized firms but not relative to
firms in their industry. This evidence could imply that firms diversify when they no longer have

growth opportunities in their industry or that the market anticipates ill-fated diversification and

already impounds it in the firm's value. We find, however, that when we use accounting
performance measures, one-segment firms that add segments have lower cash flow to total
assets and earnings to total assets than firms that do not diversify, indicating that the lower q of

firms that add segments does not appear to be due mainly or only to the market anticipating

problems with diversification. In contrast, firms with five segments that start reporting fewer

segments seem to be similar to other firms with five segments or more in q, cash flow and
earnings. There is weak evidence that firms that stop reporting only one segment experience a

fall in q relative to those that remain specialized. The firms with five segments or more that
reduce their number of segments to less than five experience an insignificant increase in q.
The paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we motivate and define the measures of firm

value and diversification we use in our analysis. In section 3, we provide extensive evidence on
the relation between q and the degree of diversification for the middle year of our sample, 1984.
In section 4, we compare the value of diversified firms to portfolios of specialized firms with similar

distributions of total assets across industries. In section 5, we investigate the stability of the
relationship between diversification and Tobin's q during our sample period. In section 6, we
examine the robustness of our results in a multivariate regression framework and by looking at

5

subsamples. In section 7, we consider firms that change their degree of diversification.
Concluding remarks are provided in section 8.

SectIon 2. DiversIfication and performance.
Almost all studies that investigate the performance of diversified firms focus on the
performance of these firms measured over a penod of time as opposed to their performance as

measured by their valuation at a point in time.1 We discuss these studies first. The conclusions

reached by these studies are heavily influenced by their sample period. This is true both for
studies that focus on accounting measures of performance and for studies that use stock-market
measures of performance. Besides the dependence of their results on the sample period, cx post

studies suffer from two additional problems. The first problem is the choice of a benchmark for
performance comparisons. The second problem is the interpretation of a finding of poor performance. We discuss these problems in studies that investigate stock-price performance, but these

problems are equally acute for studies that focus on accounting measures of performance.
In comparing the stock-price performance of conglomerates to the stock-price performance

of non-conglomerates, one has to adjust stock returns for risk. Otherwise, it might be that one set
of firms performs better simply because, having greater risk, they have to earn agreater expected

return for their shareholders. If the market correctly anticipates the performance of firms, they
should not earn abnormal returns on average once one takes risk into account. Thepresence of

abnormal returns over long periods of time could therefore be evidence that risk is not properly

Mueller (1987) provides an extensive survey of the performance literature.

e For instance, Weston, Smith and Shrieves (1972) find that in the 1960's, a sample of
conglomerates outperformed a sample of mutual funds, whereas Ravenscraft and Scherer (1987)
argue that the performance of a sample of conglomerates becomes noticeably worse if the 1 970s
are included.

6

accounted for. Since most of the studies that evaluate the stock returns of conglomerates account

for risk in a naive way, it is possible that such studies measure as performance abnormal returns
resulting from the lack of a proper risk adjustment.9 For instance, it is well-known that on average

the stock price of small firms outperforms the stock price of large firms.'° Since diversified firms
typically are large firms, they could have lower cx post returns than non-diversified firms because

of this size effect.
Further, the cx post poor performance of conglomerates over some sample penods does
not necessarily mean that cx ante diversification does not increase value. It could simply be that

unexpected technological and regulatory changes made conglomerates a less efficient
organizational form. For example, one could argue that the growth in the high yield bond market

made intra-firm capital markets less important and hence decreased one of the benefits from
intra-firm diversification.'1 It might therefore be the case that investors properly assessed the
benefits of intra-f,rrn diversification when that diversification took place but were surprised, ex
post, by changes in the costs and benefits of various institutional forms. Hence, at a point in time

diversified firms could still be valued more, but their higher valuations could fafl or increase over
a sample period.

In this paper, we avoid the drawbacks of cx post approaches by focusing on a

Most studies use the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) or make no risk adjustment. Using
the CAPM, a number of authors have shown that acquirers underperform the market for up to
three years following the acquisition (Jensen and Ruback (1983) review some of this evidence).
Franks, Hams and Titman (1991) show that these results are sensitive to how the risk-adjustment
is made; for their sample period, the abnormal returns disappear if a multi-factor model is used.
Agrawal, Jaffee and Maridelker (1992) show that the negative abnormal returns hold with a multifactor model except for mergers at the end of the 1970s,

performance measure observed at a point in time that does not require the use of a risk
adjustment, Tobin's q. The advantage of Tobin's q is that it incorporates the capitalized value of
the benefits from diversification. The problem with this is that Tobin's q reflects what the market

thinks are the benefits from diversification, whether illusory or not. Hence, for us to be able to
infer from Tobin's q the benefits from diversification, we have to assume that financial markets
are efficient and that a firm's market value is an unbiased estimate of the present value of its cash

flows. With this assumption, the ratio of the market value of the firm to the replacement value of

its assets is a measure of the contribution of the firm's intangible assets to its market value. A
firm's intangible assets include its organizational capital, reputational capital, monopolistic rents,

investment opportunities, and so on. Management's actions directly affect the value of the
intangible assets and managerial entrenchment can be viewed as an intangible asset that has

negative value. Hence, management can add or subtract from the value of the firm's tangible

assets whose replacement value is the denominator of the q formula. Since management is
responsible for the firm's investments, it can add or subtract value by choosing the right or wrong
portfolio of activities for the firm.

If the value of a portfolio of unrelated businesses is simply the sum of the values of the

unrelated businesses, then the q ratio of diversified firms should not differ from the q ratio of
specialized firms. In this case, management would not add value to the businesses by assembling

them in a conglomerate. However, if diversification creates or destroys value, then the q ratio of

diversified firms should be greater or less than the q ratio of specialized firms under the null
hypothesis that diversified firms are simply random portfolios of business units.

All variables that affect firm value affect q. Hence, there is a risk that one might attribute

to diversification differences in q that are due to variables correlated with diversification rather
than diversification itself. This possibility of attributing to diversification valuation effects caused

8

by correlated variables is a serious one. It is reduced, however, by the fact that we look at large

portfolios of firms where one would hope that the valuation effects of other variables would be
diversified away. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, we investigate extensively whether
variables known to affect q can explain the relation between q and firm diversification. First, since

diversified firms are likely to be larger, it could be that a firm's efficiency depends on its size
rather than its degree of diversification and that diversification simply proxies for size.12 Second,
when R&D is not capitalized, firms that have heavy investments in R&D have larger q's because

the replacement cost of assets does not include the capitalized value of R&D (see Salinger
(1984)). It could therefore be that, if diversified firms are less R&D intensive than specialized

firms, they have lower q's for reasons that are unrelated to diversification. Third, if financial
markets are imperfect, specialized firms might face greater obstacles exploiting investment
opportunities so that a specialized firm with a high q is a firm that cannot raise enough capital to

equate its marginal q to one. We investigate each of these alternative explanations after
presenting our results on the relation between diversification and q. The reader should remember,

however, that when we use q to infer the benefits of diversification, this inference assumes that
the capitalized value of the benefits from diversification constitute an intangible asset such that

a diversified firm extracts more cash flow out of a given portfolio of tangible assets than a
specialized firm. Hence, not finding any benefits of diversification could mean that this assumption

is incorrect.

In an earlier paper, Wernerfelt and Montgomery (1988) investigate the contributions to q

of industry, focus and market share. They do not provide estimates of regression coefficients.
Instead, they indicate the contribution of these variables to the adjusted R2 of a regression for 247

performance differs when one controls for size in a study that uses total factor productivity as the
estimate of performance.

firms for 1976. In that paper, they argue that the effect of focus on performance is positive and

has a marginal contribution to adjusted R2 of less than 3%. Their limited database makes it
impossible for them to provide direct comparisons between diversified and specialized firms.

Our approach differs from studies that use stock returns to evaluate how the market
assesses changes in the degree of diversification of firms. For instance, Morck, Shleifer and
Vishny (1990) show that unrelated acquisitions have a negative announcement effect on stock

prices in the 1980s and Kaplan and Weisbach (1992) provide evidence on the divestiture of
diversifying acquisitions. In their study, Comment and Jarrell (1993) do not perform an event study

but instead estimate the cumulative abnormal returns over the year of the change in focus and

the year preceding the change in focus. With this approach, after controlling for a number of
variables that are known to affect abnormal returns, they find a significant positive correlation

between abnormal returns and increases in focus. These studies address the issue of how
changes in the degree of diversification initiated by firms affect firm value. In contrast, we address

the issue of the efficiency of diversified firms directly. Both approaches are instructive, but they
provide information about different issues. Return studies provide information about the correlation

between firm value and changes in firms' activities. For event studies, causality is well
established: the announcement of a focusing or diversifying event is the cause of the change in
value. There is a problem in interpreting these studies: the change in the degree of diversification
could come about because the firm failed in its diversification rather than because diversification
is unprofitable in general. For the studies that look at longer periods to estimate returns coincident

with changes in diversification, there is some possibility of spurious correlation since returns are
affected by many variables, some of which might be correlated with the change in the degree of
diversification. By looking at changes in the degree of diversification and relating them to changes

in firm value, however, the advantage of the Comment and Jarrell (1993) study is that it can

10

exclude spurious correlation from variables that do not change over time, whereas we cannot.

Section 3. Tobin's q and diversification measures.
Alt our data comes from COMPUSTAT. The Business Information file of COMPUSTAT
provides information for firms disaggregated for upto 10 different industry segments. FASB-SFAS

No. 14 and SEC Regulation S-K require firms to report segment information for fiscal years
ending after December 15, 1977. SFAS No. 14 defines an industry segment as "A component of
an enterprise engaged in providing a product or service, or a group of related products or services

primarily to unaffiliated customers (i.e., customers outside the enterprise) for a profit." Firms must

report information for segments that represent 10% or more of the consolidated sales. The file
has information available for some firms for 1976 and 1977 though firms did not have to report
for these years if their fiscal year ends December 15 or earlier. In the following, however, we use
only data reported in 1978 and later to have the whole reporting population in each sample year.

For this purpose,we used the active and research files of COMPUSTAT, so that our sample
includes the firms that were subsequently delisted from COMPUSTAT because of mergers,
bankruptcies, liquidations, and so on. Note that we use segment information for firms dropped
from the Industry Segment File.
We construct q using the algorithm proposed by Lindenberg and Ross (1981) and modified

by Smirlock, Gilligan and Marshall (1984) to compute replacement cost of plant and equipment.

As suggested by Lindenberg and Ross (1981), we set up an acquisition schedule for plant and

equipment and correct for price level changes using the implicit GNP price deflator and for
depreciation assuming 5% depreciation per year. We assume that the technological parameter

is zero as in Smirlock, Gilligan and Marshall (1984) and assume that the value of plant and
equipment equals its book value in 1970. We treat inventories as suggested by Lindenberg and
11

Ross (1981). Finally, we assume that the replacement value of other assets equals book value.

Consequently, to compute the denominator of Tobiri's q, we use the book value of assets other

than plant, equipment and inventories and the estimated replacement cost of plant, equipment

and inventories. To compute the numerator of Tobin's q, we use the market value of common

stock and the book value of debt and preferred stock. The end-of-year number of shares of
common stock and end-of-year stock price are obtained from COMPUSTAT. We excJude firms
that have less than 100 million dollars of assets on average in COMPUSTAT to keep the dataset

manageable. In section 6, we show that even if we ignore q altogether and focus instead on the
ratio of a firm's market value to the book value of its assets, there is a negative significant relation

between market-to-book and the degree of diversification. Since market-to-book is a coarser
measure of the valuation ratio we want to consider, the use of the market-to-book ratio means
that we explain a smaller proportion of the cross-sectional variation in firm valuation with that ratio

than with q and also that the relation between valuation and the degree of diversification is
estimated less precisely.

The literature on diversification has also used other data sources to measure the degree
of diversification. In an eatlier study measuring the degree of diversification of firms, Scherer and

Ravenscraft (1984) use data from the 1975 Line of Business sample of the Federal Trade
Commission. To construct this sample, the FTC collected sales and other financialvariables from
471 large corporations; the data classifies sales using 262 manufactured product categories, but

allows firms to aggregate sales from different categories into one in cases where sales in one
category are small. Scherer and Ravenscraft (1984) measure diversification using the inverse of

the Herfindahi index constructed from the lines of business sales of a firm and by counting the

number of different categories in which a firm produces. Wemerfelt and Montgomery (1988),
Lichtenberg (1992) and Liebeskind and Opler (1992) use census data on plants and measured

12

diversification in terms of numbers of different SIC codes for plants. Lichtenberg (1992) also uses
the Compustat SIC File, which reports up to 90 SIC codes per company. More recently, Comment

and Jarrell (1993) compute measures of diversification using the same database we do. The
advantage of the COMPUSTAT database is that it includes more firms than the FTC database,

is available for all years since 1976 and has segment information such as total assets per
segment. However, the COMPUSTAT database reports information for up to ten segments only,
does not have private firms and, as argued by Lichtenberg (1991), is subject to possible reporting

biases. The FTC database does not have these limitations, but it is not generally available.
We investigated three diversification measures used by Comment and Jarrell (1993). The

first measure is a Herflndahl index computed from the sales of a firm by segment. This index is
the sum of the squared values of sales per segment as a fraction of total firm sales. If a firm has

only one segment, its Herfindahi index is one; if a firm has ten segments that each contribute
10% of the sales, its Herfindahl index is 0.1. Hence, the Herfiridahi index falls as the degree of

diversification increases. The second measure is a Herfindahi index computed from the firm's
assets per segment. The third measure is simply the number of segments. A firm becomes more
diversified as its number of segments increases.13

Table 1 shows the means, medians, standard deviations and correlations of our variables

for 1984. The mean value for Tobin's q substantially exceeds its median, which is due to the
skewed distribution of q. In the following, we always report data on the mean and median of q.

The means and medians of the diversification measures indicate that the typical firm
exhibits some diversification since all median diversification measures differ from the values they

13 In preliminary work for which the research segment tapes were not available, we also
investigated a measure inspired by Scherer and Ravenscraft (1984), the number of different main
four-digit SIC codes reported by the firm. This measure turned out to be extremely similar to the
number of segments since almost all firms report segments that have different main four-digit SIC
codes.

would have if the typical firm was specialized in one segment. The correlations in table I provide
the main theme of this paper. The first row shows that Tobin's q is strongly negatively correlated
with the degree of firm diversification. The degree of diversification increases with the number of
segments and therefore the correlation is negative for that measure of diversification. In contrast,

with the Herfindahl indices, the degree of diversification falls as the Herfindahl index increases
and the correlations are positive. We provide both the Pearson correlations of the diversification

measures with Tobin's q and the Spearrnan rank-order correlations. All these correlations are
significant at the 0.01 level. The significance of the Spearrnan rank-order correlations means that

our results are not due to large q values that are spuriously associated with a low degree of
diversification. We also estimated the correlations eliminating the values of q that exceed five and

14

obtained similar results. The other correlations reported in table 1 show that our diversification
measures have very high correlations in absolute value. This explains why our results are the
same irrespective of which diversification measure we use.

In Table 2, we report the average and median values of Tobin's q for various numbers of

segments and for various values of the Herfindahl indices. Irrespective of the measure of
diversification used, the mean and median of Tobin's q for the specialized firms are higher than
for the other firms. In 1984. the average Tobin's q for the sample is 1.11 and the median is 0.77.

Consequently, the average Tobin's q for the undiversifued firms exceeds the average Tobin's q

for the sample by 39% and the median Tobin's q exceeds the sample median by 31%. These
numbers suggest a substantial difference in the valuation of diversified and specialized firms. The
relation between Tobin's q and the degree of diversification for firms with more than one segment
seems weaker: it is monotone for the mean Tobin's q when the number of segment is considered,

but not when the Herfindahl indices are used.

In table 2, the median is always smaller than the mean and proportionately more so for

the one segment firms than for the firms with more than one segment. This suggests that the
distribution of qs is skewed and has some large values. From table 1 and the non-parametric
results presented there, we know that these large values do not affect our conclusions. They do,

however, affect estimates of the diversification discount defined here as the difference between

the q of specialized firms and the q of diversified firms. This is because all the large values of

q occur for one segment firms. No q exceeds five for firms with two segments or more. In
contrast, for one segment firms, the largest q is 17. Consequently, throughout the analysis, we
keep discussing results for medians as well as for means. We also report in section 5 results from

a truncated sample where firms with q's of five and more are excluded.
In table 2, the mean q of firms with five segments or more is significantly below one with

a t-statistic for the difference from one of 11.7. Throughout the sample period, the mean q of firms

with five segments or more is always significantly below one. In contrast, the sample mean of q's
is never significantly below one during the 1980's, but is in 1978 and 1979. Obviously, the sample

mean is always greater than the mean of the firms with five segments or more and significantly
so. Looking at the medians, the median q for the firms with 5 segments or more is always below
one and always below the sample median. This evidence is difficult to reconcile with the view that

16

diversification is a valuable intangible asset. The best case for that view given our evidence is that

diversified firms allocate capital more efficiently than specialized firms because of their efficient
use of an internal capital market. This market enables the various divisions of a diversified firm

to invest up to the point where the marginal return on capital equals the cost of capital and
insures that their cost of capital is lower relative to their stand-alone cost of capital because of
the lesser impact of informational asymmetries. Hence, relative to stand-alone specialized firms,

the conglomerate invests more and might therefore have a lower q since the marginal return to
capital would be lower. With this view, however, one would expect average q to exceed one for
conglomerates because their market value would capitalize the contribution to shareholder wealth

of the reduction in informational asymmetries if there was no error in computing q. One might
therefore conclude from the low average and median q of firms with 5 segments or more that the
reduction in informational asymmetries benefit from conglomerates is dominated by inefficiencies

such as influence costs and agency costs.
Table 2 has no estimates of statistical significance of the incremental contribution to q of
diversificabon. In table 3, we provide such estimates using a regression framework for each year

in our sample. Define D(j) to be a dummy variable that takes value one if a firm has j segments

or more. We then regress q on a constant and D(j), j = 2,3,4,5. With this regression, the
coefficient on D(2) has the interpretation of the difference between q for firms with two segments

and for firms with one segment. The sum of the coefficients on D(2) and D(3) is the difference

between the q of firms with three segments and the q of firms with one segment, and so on.
Hence, the coefficient on D(j) has the interpretation of a marginal contribution to q of the j-th
segment in the cross-sectional regression. Throughout the table, the coefficient on D(2) is always

significant, so that diversified firms have a lower average q in each year. There are very few
cases where any of the other dummy variables has a significant coefficient, implying that in

17

general the contribution of the additional segments is not statistically significant. Since Out of the

39 coefficients for these additional segments only three are positive, a nonparametnc test would
reject the hypothesis that the sign of the coefficients is random. The conclusion that one can draw

from the table is that we have strong evidence that firms with two or more segments have lower

q's than firms with one segment but have weaker evidence supporting the view that there is a
significant drop in q when one moves from firms with j segments to firms with j+1 segments, when

is equal to 2 or greater. Whereas in large samples economically trivial effects can be statistically
significant, it is important to note that the effect documented here is also economically significant:

the drop in q going from one segment firms to firms with more segments implies that over the
years the q of diversified firms is lower than the q of single segment firms by 10% to almost 50%.

The diversification discount is positively correlated with the level of q and reaches a maximum

in 1983. This correlation with q could mean that diversified firms are apparently not as able to
take advantage of economy-wide changes in growth opportunities.

Table 3 also reproduces the cross-sectional distribution of firms across degrees of
diversification. As already documented by Comment and Jarrell (1991), firms became more
focused during the 1980s. For the sample we use in this study, the number of highly diversified
firms as a fraction of the number of specialized firms falls dramatically from more than 1/2 to less

than 1/6. In computing these numbers, we do not use the whole universe of firms, but only the

firms with more than 100 million dollars in assets on average. Comment and Jarrell (1993)
documented the same trend using all firms. Further, Lichtenberg (1992) and Liebeskind and Opler

(1992) also show similar results using different databases. Liebeskind and Opler (1992) find a
surprising additional result using the Tnnet database, however. They argue that highly diversified
firms that remained highly diversified actually increased their degree of diversification.

SectIon 4. A "chop-shop" approach.
In this section, we investigate whether industry effects can explain our results. If
diversification does not matter, the value of a diversified firm should be equal to the sum of the
values of its divisions if standing alone. Alternatively, the q of a conglomerate should be the sum
of the market values of its divisions standing alone divided by the sum of their replacement costs
standing alone. Such a comparison is not possible without having the market values of the stand-

alone divisions and their replacement costs. In the previous section, we abstracted from industry

effects and compared the average q of diversified firms to the average q of specialized firms. In
this section, we proxy the q of a division by the average q of the specialized firms in the industry

of the division. We call the q obtained from the proxies of the q's of the divisions the pure-play
q. Here, the pure-play q is the q the conglomerate would have if diversification does not add or
subtract value taking into account industry effects. Such an approach, though not based on q,
was pioneered by LeBaron and Speidel (1987) and named by them the "chop-shop" approach.

When forming the pure-play q for a diversified firm, it is important to remember that the
q of a portfolio of firms is a replacement-value weighted average of firms and not a market-value

20

weighted average. Comparing the q of a diversified firm to either an equally-weighted or a value-

weighted average of proxies for the q's of its divisions could lead to the spurious conclusion that

diversified firms are valued less even when they are not. To see this, let q, be the q of the i-th
division of a firm, R be the replacement cost for that division and M be the market value of that

division. q, M and R are, respectively, the q, the market value and the replacement cost of the

firm. In carrying out the "chop-shop" approach, it should be the case that if one constructs a
holding company that is just a portfolio of firms and adds nothing to the value of its holdings, the
q of that holding company should also be its pure-play q derived from the firms that constitute the

holding company. Let ct be the weight of the i-th firm in the construction of the comparison q and

assume that the holding company has n firms. In this case, the comparison becomes:

q - Z•ii 1q1

(1)

____ + E(RE(q1)] - n(Cov(a1,q + E(a1)E(q

where E(.) and Cov(.,.) indicate respectively sample means and covariances. We can now

evaluate equation (1) for three different weighting schemes. First, suppose that cx is a
replacement cost weight, i.e., the replacement cost of the i-th division divided by the sum of the
replacement costs of the firm's divisions. In this case, equation (1) is identically equal to zero and

the q of a holding company of firms is equal to the chop-shop q as long as the q of the divisions
is approximated in an unbiased way. This comparison is therefore unbiased — if diversification

21

is neutral, we find no difference between the chop-shop q and the q of the diversified firm. In
contrast, comparing the q of the diversified finn to either an equally-weighted or a value-weighted
average of the q's of the divisions leads to a bias that could suggest that diversification decreases

value even when it does not. To see this, note first that in the case of an equally-weighted
average of division q's, we get:

q-1

+ E(R1)E(qJ - n[Cov(!,qJ + !E(q)J
(2)

Cov(

E(RJ

,q1)

When comparing a diversified firm to an equally-weighted average of the q's of its constituents.

the q of the diversified firm will be lower than the q of the equally-weighted average if q's and

replacement costs are negatively correlated. Next, comparing a diversified firm to a valueweighted portfolio of the q's of its divisions leads to the following bias:

q-' u1q -qE(M E(R1)

Because of Jensen's inequality, the expression in square brackets is negative if the inverse of the

22

replacement value is not correlated with the square of the market value.14 Hence we would find

that a portfolio of firms has a lower q than the value-weighted average of the division q's even
though here diversification does not affect firm value by construction. In general, there is a bias

when using market-value weights, but the sign of the bias is hard to evaluate since it depends
on the distribution and magnitudes of the market and replacement values.

To compare the q of the conglomerate to the q of a pure-play portfolio, one should use
a replacement cost weighted average of the stand-alone q's of the divisions. Neither the division
replacement values nor the stand-alone q's can be computed directly from available data. In our
computations, we substitute for a division's replacement value the total assets of the division. As

long as the ratio of a division's total assets to a firm's total assets is an unbiased estimate of the

ratio of a division's replacement value to a firm's replacement value, our approach will be
satisfactory. To construct an estimate of the stand-alone q of a division, we take the average of

the qs of all one-segment firms in the division's 3-digit SIC code.'

In table 4, we show how the q's of firms with more than one segment differ from their

pure-play q's for 1984. The statistics we reproduce are the means and medians of the
diversification discounts, where a firm's diversification discount is the difference between its pure-

play q and its q. For comparison purpose, we also provide estimates of the difference between
the mean q of one segment firms and the mean q for firms with more than one segment. These

' To see this, note that E(M2/R) = Cov(M2,(1/R)) + E(M2)E(1/R) where the subscript i is
omitted. If the covanance term is zero, we can use Jensen's inequality to obtain the result that
E(M2)E(1/R) is no less than E(M)2/E(R). When the covariance term is not zero, the sign of the
bias cannot be assessed without explicit distributional assumptions. One would generally expect

the covariance term to be negative - i.e., large market values being associated with large
replacement values, in which case the covariance term reduces the effect of Jensen's inequality.

We also performed the comparisons with similar results using four-digit SIC codes when
a match at that level could be obtained. The results for this alternative procedure are similar to
those reproduced here.

Table 4

Industry adjusted discount of diversified firms for 1984
The industry adjusted discount for a diversified firm is the difference between its pure-play q
and its q. The pure-play q of a firm is an asset-value weighted average of division q's. The
division q is proxied by the average of the q's of one-segment firms in the same 3-digit SIC

code as the division. The unadjusted discount is the difference between the average 1segment q and the n-segment q. The t-statistics for the unadjusted discount are obtained
from a cross-sectional regression of q's on a constant and dummy variables for the number
of segments. All information is from COMPUSTAT, including the Research Files. The
sample includes all firms in the Business Information Files with more than 100 million
dollars in total assets on average.

estimates correspond to estimates of the diversification discount in the absence of the industry
adjustment. It is immediately clear that adjusting for industry effects decreases the diversification

discount. Nevertheless, the discount is positive, highly statistically significant and economically
large. With industry adjusted discounts, the difference between the mean and median is generally

less striking. The difference between the mean q of one-segment firms and two-segment firms

is 0.6 whereas the difference between the medians is 0.3. In contrast, for industry-adjusted
discounts the difference between the means is 0.35 and the difference between the medians is
0.24.

We also investigated whether the diversification discount increases with the number of

segments. In table 5, we report these results for each year in the sample. We estimated the

24

marginal effect of having an additional segment by using the same approach as in table 3. In this

case, however, the effect is measured using a firms q minus its pure-play q as the dependent
variable. For a single-segment firm, this measure is just its q minus the industry average of q. To

estimate the regressions, we used the whole sample including the single-segment firms. We do
not reproduce the constant to save space here. By construction, the constant is zero except for
rounding error. The reason we use the whole sample rather than estimate the regression using
only diversified firms is to investigate whether the diversification discount is significant given the
sampling variation of single-segment firms around their industry means. There is one case where

0(2), i.e., the marginal contribution to q of having two segments rather than one, is not
significantly different from zero, namely in 1980. For that year, however, the 0(3) coefficient, i.e.,

the marginal contribution to q of having three segments rather than two, is significantly different

from zero. The lack of significance in the regression is due to the fact that the t-statistic in the
regression compares the diversification discount of two segment firms to the industry adjusted q
of single segment firms. Although the industry adjusted q of single segment firms averages zero,

it differs across firms and if its standard deviation is large enough, it is difficult to reject the
hypothesis that the industry-adjusted q of one-segment firms differs from the industry-adjusted

q of two-segment firms. In contrast, if the diversification discount of two-segment firms is
compared to zero rather than to the industry-adjusted q of one segment firms, the diversification
discount of two-segment firms is always significantly different from zero. There are only two cases

where dummy variables forj > 2 are significantly different from zero, namely 1979 and 1980; for
both these years, however, the discount of two-segment firms is significantly different from zero
using the cross-sectional standard deviation of discounts for firms with two segments to compute

a t-statistic. The conclusions that emerge from table 5 are generally similar to those from table
3 where we compare the q's of diversified firms to the q's of single-segment firms. In table 5, we

The marginal industry-adjusted diversification discount
The industry adjusted discount for a diversified firm is the difference between
its pure-play q and its q. The pure-play q of a firm is an asset-value weighted
average of division q's. The division q is proxied by the average of the q's of
one-segment firms in the same 3-digit SIC code as the division. We estimate
two regressions for each year. In the first regression, we regress the discount
on a constant and on four dummy variables. Dummy variables DO) takes value
one if a firm has j or more segments. In the second regression, we regress the
discount on a constant and dummy variable D(Div) that takes value one if the

firms has two or more divisions. All data is from COMPUSTAT. In each
regression, we use all firms on the Business Information Files with more than
100 million dollars in assets on average including the single-segment firms. (tstatistics in parentheses.)

also report the average diversification discount measured as the coefficient on a dummy variable

that takes value one for firms with more than one segment in a regression of industry adjusted
discounts on a constant and the dummy variable.
Figure 1 shows the diversification discount for each year in our sample. For this figure, we

use medians. For comparisons of q's, we plot two series. First, we plot the difference between

the median q for one segment farms and two segment firms. Second, we plot the difference

between the median q of one segment firms and the median q of firms with five or more
segments. For the two-segment firm diversification discount, it is negative for two years at the end

of the 1970s and is positive every year afterwards. Hence, the discount first increases and then
seems to remain largely stationary. For the five-segment firms discount, it is always positive, but

also increases at the beginning. If we compute the mean differences instead, we find that the
mean difference is always significantly different from zero at the 0.01 level except for the three
years in the 1970s where the p-values for years 78,79 and 80 are respectively 0.011, 0.018 and
0.077. The difference between q's of firms with one segment and q's of firms with five segments

is significant at the 0.01 level each year, with the lowest t-statistic being 4.01 in 1990. For the
mean differences as well as the median differences, there is always more of a discount for five
segment firms than for two segment firms.
Figure 1 also shows the median industry-adjusted diversification discount for two and five

segment firms for every year in the sample. To gain some insight into the significance of these

results that is consistent with our focus on medians rather than means, we used a nonparametnc

sign test. Although we do not reproduce the results here, we find that the industry-adjusted
discounts are significantly different from zero every year. As for the unadjusted discounts, the
industry-adjusted diversification discounts increase first and then remain relatively constant.

Overall, our evidence shows that the diversification discount is economically and
statistically significant throughout the 1980s whether we adjust for industry effects or not. At the
end of the 1970s, however, the two segment firms' discount is weaker if one does not adjust for
industry effects and is weaker if one focuses on medians.

Section 5. How robust Is the diversification discount?
In this section, we investigate whether the lower q of diversified firms can be explained

by variables other than the degree of diversification of a firm. We first investigate whether
diversification proxies for other firm characteristics and then address the issue of whether biases

in the way q is computed can explain our results.

-

To investigate whether diversification proxies for other firm characteristics, we use a
multivariate regression framework where we use as explanatory variables a dummy variable that

takes value one if a firm is diversified and the following three firm characteristics:
a) Size. There exists a literature that investigates the relation between size and accounting

profitability. In this literature, it seems that for the United States, the relation between size and
profitability is ambiguous whereas abroad it is negative.16 In our sample, there is a significant
positive relation between size (defined as total assets) and the degree of diversification.t7 For

16 Mueller (1987) summarizes that literature. See Hall and Weiss (1967) and Peltzman (1977)
for the view that size is correlated with greater efficiency. Stigler (1963) argues that size is mostly
irrelevant.
17 Lichtenberg (1992) finds a similar result using a different database.

28

instance, the correlation coefficient between the number of segments and total assets is 0.227

and it is significant at the 0.01 level. Since there is a positive relation between size and
diversification, it could be that our results are explained by the fact that large firms are less
efficient rather than by the degree of diversification. To investigate this possibility, we control for
the log of total assets.
b) R&D. When we measure the replacement cost of assets, we do not incJude R&D as an
asset. Hence, firms with large R&D investments will have intangible assets that are not accounted

for in our replacement cost measures. We could therefore attribute the larger qs of singlesegment firms to specialization when it is caused by larger R&D investments. Since our results
hold when we control for industry effects, R&D can explain our results only if, within industries,
diversified firms invest less in R&D than specialized firms. In our regressions, we control for the
ratio of R&D to total assets.
C) Ability to access financial markets. In a neo-classical model where firms have a stock

of capital that they put to use with decreasing returns to scale, marginal q differs from one only
if the firms cannot raise enough capital because of capital market imperfections. It could therefore

be that specialized firms have more trouble raising funds and hence have higher q's than
diversified firms because they are unable to exhaust their positive NPV projects. To control for

this, we use a dummy variable that takes value one if a firm pays dividends. This approach is
similar to the one of Fazzan, Hubbard and Petersen (1988). Their reasoning is that a firm that
pays dividends could invest more by cutting dividends and hence it is unlikely to be rationed on
the financial markets.

In table 6, we provide estimates of this multivariate regression for 1984 using the
unadjusted discount and the adjusted discount as the dependent variables. Note that in table 5,
the estimate of the industry-adjusted diversification discount across all multi-segment firms using

29

a linear regression is 0.43 in 1984 with a t-statistic of 7.56 in absolute value. The discount
estimate in table 6 (i.e., minus one times the coefficient on the diversification dummy variable)
remains significant when we control for these other firms characteristics, but its value falls slightly.

When we use industry adjusted q's, only size has a significant coefficient in addition to the
diversification variable. Size is negatively correlated with q when controlling for diversification.
With unadjusted q's, the diversification discount falls from 0.64 to 0.43. In addition to size being
significant, whether the firm pays dividends matters also and affects q negatively. We repeated
these regressions for every year and find similar results, namely that the diversification discount
remains significant. We also estimated the regressions using cumulative dummy variables as in
tables 3 and 5 with similar results.
A possible problem with our approach of using q as a dependent variable is that firms that
are highly diversified are likely to engage more frequently in sates and purchases of divisions than

specialized firms.'8 Doing so wilt mark to market the cost of divisions. Hence, in an extreme case

where a firm replaces all its divisions every year and diversification contributes nothing, the firm
would have a q of one by definition. In contrast, if calculated replacement costs have a systematic

downward bias, specialized firms that keep the same assets over time would have a q greater
than one simply because of that bias and because of the fact that their assets are not marked

to market frequently. There is no a priori reason for a systematic bias in the estimate of
replacement costs since replacement cost calculations take inflation into account.
This potential bias would be a serious source of concern if the q ratio of highly diversified

1$ Comment and Jarrell (1993) provide useful evidence on this point. When focusing on large
firms (equity of 500 million or more) and large corporate transactions (100 million or more), they
find that the frequency of divestitures and acquisitions is much higher for firms with 5 segments
or more than for firms with one segment. In their sample, the rate of divestiture is 0.8% of all firm
years for single-segment firms and 6.7% for firms with 5 segments or more. For acquisitions, the
rates are, respectively, 2.7% and 10.9%.

Table 6

Muitlvariate regressions estimating the average diversification discount

These regressions investigate the robustness of the diversification discount for 1984. All
data is from COMPUSTAT. The regressions use the sample of firms with total assets more
than 100 millions dollars on average for which the dependent and explanatory variables
could be computed. The diversification discount variable is the coefficient on a dummy
variable that takes value one if a firm has more than one division, so that the discount is
minus one times the coefficient on the dummy variable. The unadjusted q is the firm's q.
The adjusted q is the firm's q minus the q of a pure play firm. The q of the pure-play firm is
the asset value weighted average of the proxies for the q's of the division. The proxy for the
q of a division is the average q of the single-segment firms in the sample with the same 3digit main SIC code. The constant segment sample Is obtained by eliminating all firms that
changed their number of segments during 1978 to 1983. (t-statistics in_parentheses.)

firms, i.e., of firms with five segments or more, is close to one. In our sample, however, the q of

highly diversified firms has a maximum yearly average of 0.87 in 1989 and a maximum yearly
median of 0.75 the same year. An alternative approach to investigate whether the bias should be

a source of concern is to restrict our analysis to firms that have not changed their number of
31

segments for a number of years to exclude the diversified firms that are more likely to have
assets marked to market. In table 6, we give regression estimates for firms that have not changed

their number of segments for at least the five previous years. We report the results for 1984.
When restncting our sample in this way, we lose half of the finns in 1984. Yet, the diversification
discount is still significant whether we use unadjusted or industry adjusted q's. Using this

approach, we find our results to weaken somewhat, however. With unadjusted qs, the
diversification discount is no longer significant for the last three years of the sample. With
adjusted q's, the diversification discount is not significant in 1983 and 1985, but is significant for
the last three years of the sample. If we do not control for size. R&D and dividend payments, the

diversification discount is always significant for this subsample, whether we use the adjusted or
the unadjusted q's.

A further concern has to do with outliers. We saw in section 3 that the negative relation
between q and diversification holds when we use a measure of rank correlation and hence does
not depend on a small number of outliers. An alternative approach to evaluating the robustness
of the results is to eliminate firms with large q's. We do so in the last regression of table 6, where

we eliminate all firms with q's greater than five. There are 14 firms with such q's in 1984. All of

these firms are sing'e-segment firms. Removing these firms decreases the estimate of the
diversification discount but has no impact on significance. We estimated similar regressions for
all years. In general, removing firms with q greater than five decreases the discount but increases

its significance and affects none of our qualitative conclusions.

In the last row of the table, we discard q altogether and use the numerator of q divided
by the book value of total assets. With this market-to-book ratio, there is still a significant discount

for diversification. Hence, the effect we document does not depend on the algorithm used for the
computation of q.

32

Section 7. Why do firms change their degree of diversification?
We showed that q falls as diversification increases. The approach we followed so far
relates q cross-sectionally to the degree of diversification. This raises the question of whether

firms that diversify are low q firms or whether they are high q firms that become low q firms
through diversification. In other words, do poorly performing finns diversify andfind out that doing

so does not make them high performers or is it that high performers diversify and become poor
performers?

in table 7, we provide evidence from the firms with one segment that change the number
of segments they report in our sample period to 2 or more. We call these firms diversifying firms
under the assumption that the reporting of segment numbers is unbiased. With this assumption,

firms that increase the number of segments reported are firms that either have acquired a new,

important line of business or firms that have expanded an existing line of business tothe point
where it is large enough to justify reporting. We reproduce means and medians of the relevant
statistics for the whole sample period. In computing our statistics, we standardize our variables
in the foilowing way. Consider a firm which chooses to go from one segment to two segments in
year t. We compute a segment-adjusted q for that firm by subtracting from its q the average q of

all one segment firms in that year. Using these segment-adjusted q's, we can then compute the
average q of one segment firms that choose to diversify. To construct themedian q, we proceed

in the same way, except that we subtract from firm q's the median for the year of all firms with

the same number of segments. We compute all segment-adjusted statistics in the same way.
From the evidence in table 7, firms that choose to diversify have lower average segment-adjusted

q's, but the results is not statistically significant at conventional levels for the mean. In contrast
to statistical significance, however, the result is economically significant since it implies that the
typical firm that diversifies has a q that is more than 10% lower than the q of firmsthat do not

Firms that change the number of segments they report
Data on firms with one segment that add segments (diversifying firms) and firms with five
segments or more that reduce their number of reported segments to four or less during our
sample period (focusing firms), All data is from COMPUSTAT and includes only firms on the
Business Information Files with more than 100 million dollars in total asset on average. All
statistics are for the year before the change except the last row that reports the change in q

for the end of the fiscal year before the change to the end of the fiscal year after the
changed. The mean (in mean computations) or median (in median computations) of the
sample of firms that had the same number of segments (i.e., one or five or more) in the
year before the change are subtracted from the firm statistics except the industry adjusted q
where the procedure is the same as the one used in table 4. The segment-adjusted change

in q is the segment-adjusted q at the end of the year after the change in the number of
segments minus the segment-adjusted q at the end of the year before the change in the
number of segments. There are 192 firms that diversify and 320 that choose to focus.

diversify. Also, diversifying firms have lower median segment-adjusted qs with a significant sign-

test at the 0.01 level. One possible explanation for this tendency of diversifying firms to have
lower q's is that the firms that diversify have lower q's because the market anticipates poorer

performance to result from the diversification attempt. This does not seem to be the correct

34

explanation, however, as the firms that diversify also have poor accounting performances. The
accounting performance evidence is not consistent with the free cash flow theory either.'9 This
theory predicts that firms use excess cash flows to diversify rather than to pay out dividends to

shareholders. It is clearly the case that firms that diversify seem to have poor investment
opportunities relative to those that do not. However, even if we focus on firms with q less than
one, we find (in work not reported here) that they still do not have substantial cash flowsrelative
to firms that do not diversify.
In table 7, there is a contrast between segment-adjusted q's and industry-adjusted q's. For
segment-adjusted q's of firms that diversify, all evidence points to the same direction, namely that

firms that diversify have lower q's. For industry-adjusted q's, firms that diversify have an
insignificantly higher mean q and a lower median q. In terms of the economic magnitude of the
differences, they are smaller for the median than for the mean.
The evidence of table 7 seems to be consistent with the view that firms diversify because

they have exhausted growth opportunities in their existing activities and that some of the
difficulties of these firms appear to be due to their industry. Whereas the firms that diversify
experience a drop in q relative to the firms that do not diversify over the two years following the

diversification attempt, the statistical significance of the drop is marginal. Hence, whereas the
evidence that firms do not gain from diversification seems convincing, the evidence that they
suffer from it is weaker.

We also provide some evidence for firms with five segments or more that choose to
reduce their diversification level. These firms do not appear to have lower q's than other firms with

five segments or more. Further, the accounting performance of these firms does not suggest that

they are doing poorly either. There is weak evidence that these firms outperform the firms with

35

five segments or more that do not choose to become more focused contemporaneously. There

is somewhat stronger evidence that firms that focus outperform firms that diversify. The mean

change in q of firms that focus is significantly greater than the mean change in q for firms that
diversify at the 0.10 level. The difference in median changes in q is not significant using a sign

test. interestingly, whereas firms that choose to focus have only a weak improvement in
performance relative to the firms that do not, the economic magnitude of that improvement is
consistent with the estimates provided by Comment and Jarrell (1993). To see this, note that our

computation of q uses book values of debt. Hence, all the change in the numerator of q due to
a performance improvement for constant debt shows up in equity. If a firm has a market value
of equity equal to the book value of its debt and a q of 0.5, the 0.024 improvement in q translates
in a cumulative abnormal return for the calendar year of the refocusing and the year following the
refocusing of 8%.

Section 8. Concluding remarks.
In this paper, we find that highly diversified firms have significantly lower average and

median q ratios than single-segment firms. Further, highly diversified firms have mean and
median q ratios below one and below the sample mean and median every year in our sample
period. This evidence shows strongly that highly diversified firms are consistently valued less than

specialized firms. Our attempt to explain this valuation difference in terms of industry effects is
not successful. Whereas industry effects explain part of the discount of diversified firms, they do

not explain all of it. Hence, when we compare the q's of diversified firms to estimates of the qs
they would have if broken up into portfolios of specialized firms under the assumption that each

division would inherit the average q of the specialized firms in their industry, we find that
diversified firms have lower q's. We show further that the valuation differences are not explained

36

away but are reduced by taking into account differences in size orR&D expenditures between
single-segment and highly diversified firms or by constraints that prevent single-segment firms

from accessing capital markets. After investigating the robustness of our results, we conclude
therefore that there is a diversification discount in our dataset. We argue that this diversification

discount is not due to reporting biases or subtle advantages of diversified firms that we do not

capture in our tests, but can only provide indirect evidence on these issues given the data
available to us.
Our evidence is supportive of the view that diversification is not a successful path to higher

performance but it is less definitive on the question of the extent to which diversification hurts
performance. This is because, in our sample, the firms that become more diversified appear to

perform poorly before becoming more diversified, indicating that firms that diversify do not
become poor performers only or mainly because they diversify. A plausible explanation for our
results is that diversifying firms seek growth through diversification because they have exhausted

growth opportunities in their existing activities. This explanation suggests that further insights

could be obtained by investigating diversification at a more disaggregated level than at the
segment level and by distinguishing between firms that diversify into similar activities and those

that diversify into unrelated activities. Presumably, firms that diversify into similar activities can
use some of their existing skills and hence might have a comparative advantage in these activities
whereas firms that diversify into unrelated activities might not have such an advantage and hence

might perform poorly. Our results suggest also that a more detailed disaggregated analysis of the

benefits and costs of diversification that tests explicit models of these benefits and costs would

be useful since our evidence is not inconsistent with the view that some firms do gain from
diversification.
