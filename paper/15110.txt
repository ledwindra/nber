Risk Allocation, Debt Fueled Expansion and Financial Crisis
Paul Beaudry and Amartya Lahiri
NBER Working Paper No. 15110
June 2009
JEL No. E3,E4,G01
ABSTRACT
In this paper we discuss how several macroeconomic features of the 2001-2009 period may have resulted
from a process in which financial markets were trying to allocate risk between heterogeneous agents
when productive investment opportunities are scarce. We begin by showing how heterogeneity in
terms of risk tolerance can cause financial markets to propagate transitory shocks and induce higher
output volatility, albeit with a higher mean. We then show how this simple heterogeneous agent framework
can explain an expansion driven by the growth in consumer debt, and why the equilibrium path of
such an economy is likely fragile. In particular, we demonstrate that the emergence of a small amount
of asymmetric information can make the economy susceptible to changes in expectations that can
induce large reversals of financial flows, the freezing of assets and a recession that can persist despite
high productivity.

Introduction

What caused the expansion of 2001-2007, and how is it related to the subsequent financial
and economic contraction? There are currently many proposed explanations. For example,
common explanations involve a combination of an overly expansive monetary policy, a saving
glut driven by foreign investors, irrational exuberance involving house prices, opaque financial
securities, fraudulent mortgage brokers, and excessive risk taking by poorly supervised bank
executives. While all of these forces may have been present, they all suggest that the 20012007 expansion was built mainly on errors. Accordingly, the subsequent crisis is viewed by
many as the natural and unavoidable outcome of a market economy gone mad.
In this paper we argue that to understand this episode it may be helpful to initially abstract
from the many errors and abuses that arose during this period, and instead begin by identifying the nature of the allocation problem the economy was trying to solve. By adopting
such a focus, it should become possible to examine whether the exploitation of objective
gains from trade made possible through new financial relationships may explain the credit
driven expansion that subsequently lead to a financial crisis. In our view, such an approach
has the potential of isolating the more fundamental causes behind this episode and thereby
may help identify solutions or remedies that can better prevent its recurrence and accelerate
recovery. Since any explanation for developments occurring during this period will rely on
capturing important macroeconomic interactions between real and financial factors, one of
the aims of this paper is also to offer a new and simple framework in which these issues can
be discussed.
There are several features which we believe are key to understanding this period. First,
recall that the early years of the 21st century were particular from a historical standpoint on
many dimensions. The recession of 2001 resulted in large part from a negative re-evaluation
of the investment opportunities associated with information technology. In other words, this
was a period where profitable investment opportunities in new technologies seemed much
less abundant than in the late nineties. However, contrary to most recessions, profits in
general did not decline and profits in the financial industry actually rose. Part of this rise in
profits reflected the very strong productivity growth which was not matched by wage growth.
Hence, the 2001-2007 period can be viewed as a period where profits where high but where
productive investment opportunities were viewed as quite scarce. At the same time, one of
the objectives of the financial industry during this period was to promote financial innovation
that favored the allocation of risk toward those most willing and capable to bear it. This
suggests that heterogeneity in terms of risk tolerance may be important for understanding
the financial developments observed over the period. These observations lead us to ask the
following set of questions: How does an economy with aggregate risk and heterogeneous
agents (in terms of risk tolerance) adjust to a period of high profits/productivity with rather
limited investment opportunities? Can the adjustment to such a situation explain features
observed over the 2001-2007 period? Why may such an adjustment lead to a crisis, as seen
post-2007?
Our approach to answering these questions is to begin by presenting a model of systematic
risk allocation. In the model, agents differ in terms of risk tolerance. We use the model to
2

examine how an economy may adjust to good profit/productivity shocks in the absence of
abundant investment opportunities. However before using the model to interpret recent observations, we use it to better understand what macro-risk allocation implies. For example,
we show how and why the efficient allocation of systemic risk can give rise to macroeconomic
outcomes that are more volatile in comparison to those arising in less developed financial
markets. In fact, we show that efficient financial arrangements can cause simple transitory
disturbances to be both amplified and propagated over time, thereby explaining how a developed financial system may be a contributor to macroeconomic fluctuations as opposed to
being a stabilizing force.
The model we present has a set of key assumptions which allows it to capture real-financial
interactions. In particular, we model employment decisions as inherently risky investment,
as we assume that work must be executed before its production value is fully known. This
simple modification implies that employment decisions are affected by the price of risk in the
economy, and therefore is related to the allocation of risk. Hence, in the model employment
decisions affect agents’ willingness to hold financial assets, which in turn affects the price of
risk which feeds back on employment and output. It is worth stressing that the interaction
highlighted here is quite different from that found in much of the macro-financial literature
which usually emphasizes how collateral constraints affect a firm’s access to credit. Our
approach, on the other hand, emphasizes the determinants of the supply of “risky credit” to
firms (that is, the supply of credit for a firm with given risk characteristics). In fact, there
is a key state variable that emerges in our setting which can be referred to as the amount of
“risk capital” available in the economy. As more risk capital is offered on the market by risk
tolerant individuals, risk premia decrease and employment expands. The opposite happens
if this risk capital is depleted. The strong role of risk capital in determining macro-economic
performance is one of the key feature of the model.
What happens in this economy when there is a good productivity outcome but no new investment possibilities? In the model, a good productivity outcome tends to disproportionately
benefit risk tolerant individuals since they hold leveraged positions in risky assets and hence
are the residual claimants to the income flows generated by these assets. This gives rise to
a situation where high profitability in the financial sector induces an abundant supply of
risky capital since risk tolerant individuals use their new wealth to take greater risky asset
positions and thereby implicitly insure others. The situation is akin to a savings glut, but
instead of being driven by an abundant supply of risk free credit from a foreign source, as
is commonly discussed in the literature, it corresponds to a strong domestic supply of risk
taking capital. We show how this supply of risk taking capital can simultaneously lead to an
increase in consumer lending, increased employment, decrease in risk premia and increased
leverage. All of these were observed over the period 2001-2007.
So if our narrative is relevant and the credit expansion of the early 2000s reflected in part
the economy’s response to a series of high profit outcomes, why did it end in a financial
crisis and a severe recession? Here we argue that while these financial developments may
have had many benefits, they did have an important drawback: they greatly increased the
vulnerability of the economy to adverse selection and expectation driven swings in asset
flows. We illustrate this within the model by showing how a small amount of asymmetric
3

information regarding the quality of consumer debt can lead to a drastic increase in the risk
premium due to a freezing up of a certain asset class. This precipitates a large contraction
in economic activity which can persist for a while despite productivity staying high.
While we do not claim that the adverse selection problem formalized in the model is the only
source behind the recession that started in 2008, we believe it illustrates how the recycling
of financial profits can lead to a financial system that is very vulnerable. For this reason, we
view our narrative as telling a cautionary tale. While the allocation of risk to those most
willing to bear it has the potential of favoring economic activity, it can, at the same time,
also render the system sensitive to small perturbations, especially if those events cause risk
tolerant individuals to withdraw their funds from the financing of risky endeavors. In fact,
the collapse in our model leads to employment outcomes that are worse than those that
would be observed under financial autarky.
The model also offers a new perspective on the expansion of securitization over this period.
Instead of viewing this expansion as an exogenous event, the forces we highlight suggest that
the economy as a whole was in need of financial innovation in order to help risk averse agents
borrow from risk tolerant individuals who were flush with funds and searching to take on risky
positions. Moreover, these risk tolerant individuals wanted these borrowing arrangements
to be marketable and hopefully secure, so they could use them to support highly leveraged
positions. Hence, in our view, the securitization process was not a driving force behind this
period but was instead a natural outcome of the underlying economic problem the economy
was trying to solve.1
Our work is related to two strands of the literature on finance and macroeconomics. The
first is the work on credit market imperfections and the financial accelerator.2 This literature formalizes environments in which the effects of bad shocks are amplified through
financial frictions. Our model also generates a propagation mechanism for real shocks but
the mechanism works differently as it does not rely on affecting the borrowing constraints
of firms through the pricing of their assets or the value of their internal wealth. Instead
our model emphasizes variation in the aggregate supply side of risk capital available on the
market.
Our work is also related to the literature on behavioral finance which explores the allocations
that arise in financial markets that are influenced by investor sentiment. Particularly relevant is a recent paper by Shleifer and Vishny (2009) who show how such markets can lead to
procycical investment behavior as well as provide a propagation mechanism for shocks. Also
related is the work of Acharya et al (2009) and Diamond and Rajan (2009) who investigate
environments in which credit markets are prone to freezing up. It is worth reiterating that,
aside from the differences in details of the mechanism at work, our work differs from most
of the related work on this topic in that we try to provide an explanation for the entire
1

In our model, house and land price appreciations do not play any role. However, the model can be easily
extended to include such a mechanism. The main result of adding price appreciation is to amplify the effects
we discuss.

Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) and Williamson (1987). Korinek (2009) explores
the (sub) optimality and policy implications of the typical investment allocations that arise in these models.

boom-bust cycle of 2002-08 rather than just for the financial crisis episode in 2008.
The paper is structured as follows. In the next section we present some evidence which
motivates our modeling choices and our narrative for the 2001-2007 period. Section 3 provides a short summary of the mechanisms at play in the model that we formalize. Section
4 presents a simple one-period model with heterogeneous agents and aggregate risk to highlight the role of insurance and the interaction of the real and financial sectors in the model.
Section 5 extends the one-period model to a dynamic (overlapping generations) setting and
derives the time paths for debt, risky assets, risk premia and production. In Section 6 we
introduce default risk and asymmetric information into the model and show how the resulting adverse selection problem can cause multiple equilibria and expectation driven swings
from optimistic equilibria with full risk pooling and low risk premia to pessimistic equilibria
with little/no asset trade, low employment and high risk premia. Section 7 discusses the
sensitivity of our main results to the availability of productive investment opportunities.
The last section concludes. Proofs of all the Propositions are contained in the Appendix.

Empirical Patterns

Our narrative of the evolution of the US economy between 2001-2007 relies on a number of
facts which we outline in this section. First, as is well known, this period was marked by a
rapid build up of debt and leverage ratios. This can be seen in Figure 1 which shows that
the Debt to GDP ratios of households, the private sector as well as the domestic financial
sector all went up during this period.
Next, Figure 2 shows that the corporate profit rate rose across both the financial and nonfinancial sectors to historic highs during this period. Moreover, the high profit rate went
hand-in-hand with high labor productivity, as Figure 3 makes clear.
With labor productivity being high and profits also rising, did firms start investing more
during this period? Figure 4 shows the rate of non-residential investment during this period.
Contrary to what one would expect to see during a high productivity phase, investment rates
stayed relatively low. In fact, non-residential investment during this phase was lower than
during the recession of 1981. This low investment rate is particularly surprising given the low
real rates of interest during this period, see Figure 5, and the low spread on corporate debt,
see Figure 6. To further place this low investment rate into perspective, Figure 7 reports the
ratio of profits to non-residential investment. As can be seen in the figure, the size of profits
have historically been about equal to 80% of non-residential investment. However, over the
2002-2007 period they represented more that 100%. These observations lead us to view the
2002-2007 period as one where productive investments appeared rather scarce even though
there were substantial profits available for reinvestment.3

end of this period can be found in Brunnermeier (2009).

Summary of mechanisms

Before formally presenting the model, it is helpful to first outline the main assumptions
and mechanism at play. In particular, since the model is very stylized, it is important to
emphasize what elements and behavior the model is attempting to capture. Recall that
the objective of the model is to illustrate how and when an expansion driven by increased
consumer debt and financial leverage can arise, and why such an expansion is likely to be
vulnerable to sudden reversals. The two main features of the model are: (a) agents with
different degrees of risk tolerance interact to determine asset prices and, most importantly,
the risk premium; (b) the risk premium influences economic activity. The risk premium
directly influences economic activity in the model due to the assumption that the actual value
of output is unknown at the time of hiring. Heterogeneity in risk preference is introduced by
allowing for two types of individuals – risk neutral and risk averse.4 Risk neutral individuals,
who we call financiers, will be endowed with preferences that induce them to act like a
dynasty which maximizes end of period wealth and consumes a fix proportion of its resources
every period. Risk averse households, who we refer to as workers, act optimally to determine
their borrowing, labor supply and asset holdings.
The key market in the model is the market for risk capital as it jointly determines the risk
premium and employment. The demand for risk capital comes from firms and depends on
technological characteristics. The supply of risk capital comes from the different agents
(households and financiers) with different degrees of risk tolerance. Financiers use their
holdings of household debt to finance their supply of risk capital to the market. The dynamics
in the model are driven by variations in the supply of risk taking capital. Risk neutral
financiers are willing to take on risk in search of high returns and are only constrained
in their risk taking by a solvency requirement. Since these financiers will hold very risky
portfolios, their capacity to bear risk will be sensitive to firms’ profit outcomes. When profits
are high, financiers gain disproportionately. This increases the resources available to them
for lending to households today which, in turn, allows financiers to acquire more risky assets
tomorrow. The additional investment in risky assets induces a decrease in the risk premium
and raises employment. In contrast, when a bad profit outcome arises, these financiers lose
substantially. This reverses the previous mechanism and leads to a rise in the risk premium
as well as a fall in employment.
The responses highlighted above are all efficient and there is no sense of any financial “crisis”
in what we described. To get at that aspect we then introduce default risk and private
information. In particular we show that once households can default on their debt and
financiers know the default rate on their own portfolios, the market for risky credit is subject
to adverse selection due to the familiar “lemons” problem. In particular, financiers with
better quality household debt on their books may have an incentive to withhold these from
the risk capital market. Such an environment is prone to multiple equilibria which are
4

There is a growing literature which analyzes implications of heterogeneity in terms of risk tolerance.
Most of this literature focuses on asset price. See for example Chan and Kogan (2002), or Garleanu and
Panageas (2008). Our paper differs from the literature by focusing on interactions between real and financial
factors when agents differ in terms of risk tolerance.

10

sensitive to expectations. Hence, such an economy could easily move from an “optimistic”
equilibrium in which agents behave as if there were no adverse selection to a “pessimistic”
equilibrium in which the market for risk capital completely freezes up as all agents expect only
the worst quality assets to be sold on this market. From the perspective of the model then,
a financial crisis is a switch from an “optimistic” equilibrium to a “pessimistic” equilibrium.

A one period model

In order to flesh out the key mechanisms at play, we start by presenting a simple one-period
model of a closed economy with two types of agents – workers and financiers – who differ
in their degree of risk aversion. The framework is designed to illustrate the macroeconomic
properties of an economy which aims to efficiently allocate aggregate risk between agents with
different degrees of risk tolerance. While the one period structure precludes any discussion
of dynamics, it highlights the nature of the interaction between the real and financial sides
of the model. We should note that the one-period model takes as given the inherited asset
positions of workers and financiers. These positions will be rendered endogenous in the next
section.
Consider a one-period economy that produces output using the technology
y = Al

(1)

where A denotes labor productivity. Productivity is stochastic and follows an i.i.d. binomial
process

1
with probablity q
A=
θ
with probability 1 − q
where θ < 1. Productivity is the sole source of uncertainty in this economy.
Events unfold in this economy as follows: at the beginning of the period asset markets as well
as labor markets open. Stocks and bonds are traded in asset markets while employment and
wage contracts are struck in labor markets. Thereafter the productivity shock is revealed
whereupon output is produced, claims are settled and agents consume.

4.1

Firms

Firms hire labor to produce output using the technology given by equation (1). Labor hiring
decisions and wage payments need to be made before observing the productivity shock for
the period. Without loss of generality, we can assume that firms finance this by issuing
shares (risky claims) to output produced by labor. Each share pays one unit of output in
the good state (when A = 1) and θ units of output in the bad state. Thus, firms maximize
ps S − wl
subject to the solvency constraint S ≤ l, where ps denotes the price of stock, S denotes the
number of shares sold, w is the wage rate and l is the level of employment. If w > ps , then
11

firms will not hire, if w < ps , firms will want to hire an infinite amount. Hence, market
equilibrium will require5 :
ps = w.

4.2

Workers

The economy is inhabited by a continuum of identical worker-households of measure one.
Workers have one unit of labor time that they can allocate to work or leisure. Utility of
workers is given by
V w = u (cw + g (1 − l)) ,

u0 >, u00 < 0, g 0 > 0, g 00 ≤ 0,

where cw denotes consumption of workers and l is labor supplied to the market.
We assume that each worker inherits a stock of debt d which needs to be paid off before the
period ends. Thus, workers face the state-contingent budget constraints
ps sw + pb bw = wl
w
w
cw
g = s +b −d
w
w
cw
b = θs + b − d
w
where cw
g denotes consumption by workers in the good state when A = 1 while cb denotes
consumption in the bad state when A = θ. sw is stock holdings of workers while bw denote
their bond holdings. The first equation gives the budget constraint that workers face in
their asset market transactions while the last two equations are the budget constraints that
dictate their state contingent consumption allocations.

It is useful at this stage to note that the (percentage) expected excess return to holding stock
b
b
− 1. In the rest of the paper we will refer to pps as the risk
versus bonds is given by p E[A]
ps
premium as it is an affine transformation of the excess return.
The workers utility maximization problem leads to two first order conditions:

In this economy hiring labor is a risky activity since labor productivity is unknown prior to
s

The first condition shows that at an optimum workers equate the marginal utility from safe,

This extremely simple relationship between the price of stock and the wage results from the assumption
that there are constant returns to labor in the model. If we allowed for decreasing returns to labor, which
is an easy generalization, the price of stock would vary more than wages which would be more empiricaly
reasonable.

activity. The second condition dictates the optimal mix of stocks and bonds in the mature
s
worker’s portfolio. Note that worker behavior only depends on the ratio ppb , not on each
price individually.

4.3

Financiers

Financiers are also identical and of unit mass. The representative financier maximizes utility
V F where
V F = cF
where cF denotes financier consumption. Hence, the linearity of financier preferences implies
that they are risk neutral which is a key source of difference relative to workers.
Financiers are born with an initial endowment of assets d (which is the inherited debt of
workers) which becomes due back to them at the end of the period. Thus, the state
contingent budget constraints of the financiers are given by
p s sF + p b b F = 0
cFg = sF + bF + d
cFb = θsF + bF + d
where the first equation is the constraint on asset market transactions of financiers while
the last two are the state-contingent constraints on their consumption flows. Note that sF
denotes stock holdings of financiers while bF denotes their bond holdings. Combining these
constraints yields the following restriction on all admissible state-contingent consumption
allocations:

Equation (2) makes clear that the effective price of wealth in the good state is ppb − θ while

the corresponding price in the bad state is 1− ppb . Lastly, admissible consumption allocations
must satisfy financier solvency which requires that cFg ≥ 0 and cFb ≥ 0.
Financiers have a portfolio problem to solve in order to maximize their expected end of period
consumption. The solution for this optimization problem dictates that at an optimum we
must have

pb
If this condition is not satisfied then the marginal utility from cFg would be negative which
would lead to a violation of the solvency restrictions cFg ≥ 0. Intuitively, if the condition is
violated then the risk premium is so low that the relative cost of taking equity positions is
greater than the expected returns from stocks which would induce financiers to take short
positions in stocks.
Given the linearity of financier preferences, there are two potential cases to be analyzed.

that bF = −θsF − d < 0, i.e., financiers issue bonds to finance the purchase of a leveraged
portfolio of stock.

Case 2. If ppb = E[A], then the financier is indifferent between all consumptions pairs that
satisfy equation (2).

Throughout the paper we shall maintain the following two assumptions:
Assumption 1: E[A] = q + (1 − q)θ > g 0 (1)
Assumption 2: g 0 (0) = ∞.
In order for the equilibrium of this economy to potentially involve positive levels of employment, it is necessary to assume that the technology is sufficiently productive relative to
workers’ value of time. This is captured by Assumption 1. Assumption 2 will ensure that
equilibrium levels of employment are interior (0 < l < 1). This will eliminate the need to
cover potential corner solutions where l = 1.

4.5

Autarky

Before examining equilibrium outcomes for the economy with both workers and financiers,
it is useful to first examine how this economy would behave if there were no financiers. In
this case, the equilibrium characterization of worker behavior is very simple. The Walrasian
14

equilibrium is characterized by a time-invariant level of employment denoted by la , and a
b
time invariant risk premium ppas . These two variables are determined by the equations:
a

psa
= g 0 (1 − la )
pba
qu0 (la + g (1 − la )) + θ (1 − q) u0 (θla + g (1 − la ))
psa
=
pba
qu0 (la + g (1 − la )) + (1 − q) u0 (θla + g (1 − la ))
where we have substituted out the state contingent consumption levels of workers by using
the market clearing conditions. Output for this economy is given by Ala .
The autarkic case makes clear the role that financiers play in this one period economy.
Financiers provide insurance to workers and firms by acquiring claims to risky production.
This margin is missing in the autarkic case with no financiers. This then leads to the
question: How does the presence of individuals with different levels of risk tolerance affect
the behavior of an economy when financial markets can act to allocate aggregate/systemic
risk between them?

4.6

Comparative Statics

The market clearing conditions along with the household optimality conditions define a system of two equations that describe the effect of the state variable debt d on equilibrium
employment l and the risk premium pb /ps . We summarize these effects in two propositions. Proposition 1 gives a description of the relations between employment and debt,
while Proposition 2 expresses the relationship for the risk premium.
Proposition 1: The level of employment is a continuous and weakly increasing function

when d ∈ 0, d˜ , d˜ > 0, and is constant for all d ≥ d.
The cutoff level of debt d˜ is defined by the solution to the following equations, where ˜l is

pa

Propositions 1 and 2 indicate that the equilibrium of our model has the property that when
households are more indebted, employment is higher and the risk premium is lower. The
15

easiest way to understand these results is by first noticing that debt reflects the initial wealth
position of financiers. Since financiers are risk neutral, their initial wealth can be thought
of as the amount of funds available for taking on risk. For this reason, it is useful to think
of d as the amount of risk capital available to financiers for providing insurance to firms.
When financiers have more wealth, they are able to take a more leveraged position in risky
claims (stock). This increases the price of risky claims and, consequently, decreases the risk
premium. The decline in the risk premium pushes firms to increase employment. As long
as the expected value of investing in risky assets is greater than the value of investing in
safe assets, financiers will choose a portfolio mix between bonds and stock which leads to
positive net pay-outs only in the good state. This has the effect of maximizing the downward
pressure on the risk premium and favoring employment. It is only when the risk premium
b
disappears, i.e., when d > d˜ (and hence pps = q + (1 − q)θ), that debt no longer has a positive
effect on employment. Any increase in debt beyond this threshold level is used solely to
build a portfolio that keeps the risk premium at zero.

5

The model with dynamics

We now extend the model to a multi-period setting in order to illustrate the dynamics
that would likely arise in the type of economy we explored in the previous section. While
previously we had just started off financiers and worker-households with some inherited asset
positions (specifically, their debt positions), we now endogeneize those asset positions and
track out the implied equilibrium dynamics.
We start by focusing on a pure consumption-loan version of the model; that is, a version
where there are no available productive investment opportunities. We choose this version
since it allows us to capture in an extreme form the desired property that profitable investment opportunities in physical capital are scarce. Moreover, it allows for a clear description
of the macroeconomic implications of aggregate risk sharing, separate from any role played
by collateral and physical capital accumulation. We believe that this is a good way to highlight a new mechanism that may have been underlying the 2002-2008 episode. As we will
show at the end of this section, the results from our consumption-loan model extend almost
trivially to a situation where consumers can invest in durable goods (such as housing). For
this reason, the debt taken on by consumers in the model can be interpreted as being akin
to mortgages.6
Our dynamic model economy builds on an overlapping generations setup inhabited by two
kinds of agents – workers and financiers. At every date t new generations of workers and
financiers are born who live for two periods. Thus, at each date mature workers overlap
with young workers and mature financiers overlap with young financiers. We consider a
closed economy with the same production structure as in the one-period model and the
6

In the following section, we will examine how the results change when we allow for productive but risky
investment opportunities. We will show how certain implications of our model are diluted when there is
an abundance of risky investment opportunities, and this explains why we believe the model is particularly
relevant for the 2002-2008 period where such opportunities were not abundant.

16

same stochastic description for the productivity parameter A. We have chosen to adopt
a two period overlapping generations setting to discuss dynamics since we believe it is the
simplest way to extend our one period model and illustrate its multi-period implications. In
particular, our goal is to highlight why the dynamics of employment and risk premium are
likely to exhibit important asymmetries.
The timing of events is as follows: at the beginning of every period both asset markets and
labor markets open. Mature agents buy and sell risky claims and risk free bonds in asset
markets while employment and wage decisions are made in the labor market. We will refer
to the risky claim as a stock and the risk free claim as a bond, although the risky claim can
alternatively be thought of as a risky bond. After these markets close, a new cohort of agents
is born, the productivity shock is revealed and output for the period is produced. After
the productivity realization, all outstanding claims in asset markets are settled including
the stock and bond claims contracted at the beginning of the period. At this point young
agents may receive transfer from old agents and they can use these proceeds to borrow or
lend in the debt market.7

5.1

Workers

At every date a continuum of workers of measure one is born. Workers now live for two
periods. In the first period of life they receive y units of the good as an endowment while
they have one unit of labor time in the second period of life which they can use for either
work or leisure. The lifetime welfare of a representative worker born at date t is given by


Vty = Et u (cyt ) + u cot+1 + g (1 − lt+1 ) ,
where cy denotes consumption when young, co is consumption when mature and l denotes
labor supply. We assume throughout that u0 > 0, u00 < 0, g 0 > 0, g 00 ≤ 0. We deliberately
adopt a utility structure where there are no wealth effects on labor supply as we want to
illustrate mechanisms that do not rely on this force. The structure we choose forces workerhouseholds to face non-trivial decisions in terms of saving, labor supply and risk taking.
Workers can access a debt market at the end of the first period of life in order to borrow
or lend. In the second period of life, workers supply labor and receive wages that they
can invest in stocks and bonds. Stocks and bonds payout at the end of period after the
realization of At .8 The state contingent flow budget constraints facing the worker in each
period of life are
cyt = y + pdt dt
(3)
7

In principle, we could allow for the young agents to use the proceeds from debt market transactions to
buy a consumer durable (which could be interpreted as housing) which renders consumption services in both
the first and second period of life. However, to clarify the mechanisms at work, we choose to focus for now
on the case where goods are non-durables and we discuss the extension to the durable goods case later.
8
We should note that the structure of the asset market is sufficiently rich to mimic a full state contingent
claims market. In particular, since the payout on stocks is state-contingent we could equivalently formalize
this environment using state-contingent claims markets.

(4)

cogt+1 = sot+1 + bot+1 − dt

(5)

cobt+1 = θsot+1 + bot+1 − dt

(6)

where pd denotes the price of debt, d denotes debt incurred by a young worker, ps and pb
denote the price of stock and bonds respectively, w denotes wages, while s and b denote
stocks and bonds respectively. cogt+1 denotes consumption of the mature worker at date t + 1
in the good state when A = 1. Analogously, cobt+1 is consumption of the mature worker at
date t + 1 in the bad state when A = θ.
The workers maximization problem leads to three optimality conditions:

(7)

(8)
(9)

The first two conditions are identical to the optimality conditions in the one-period model
analyzed above. The third condition, which is the new feature of the dynamic model,
determines optimal borrowing by young agents in the first period of life. It is the standard
Euler equation which equates the marginal rate of substitution between current and expected
future income with the relative price of current consumption 1/pd (which is the rate of return
to saving).

5.2

Financiers

In every period a new cohort of financiers is born which lives for two periods. Every cohort
has a continuum of financiers of measure one. In the first period of life young financiers
born at date t receive an endowment f of the good as well as transfers Tt from old financiers.
They can either consume these resources or use these to lend to other young agents. In the
second period of life they begin by transacting in stock and bond markets, which allows them
to leverage their inherited asset position and create a risky portfolio. The only constraint
on financiers is solvency in that their consumption cannot be negative. At the end of the
period, they receive payments on all their claims. Financiers, as before, are assumed to be
risk neutral.
We will assume that financiers get no utility from consuming in the first period of their life.
This simplifies the analysis as it will make financiers decision when young trivial, since they
will simply lend all there resources to young worker-households. Allowing for financiers to
18

consume when young can be easily accommodated, but does not provide additional insight.
The second important assumption we make about financiers is that they get utility from
transferring bequests to the next generation of financiers. In particular, we will assume that
their objective is to maximize



VtF = Et min γcFt+1 , (1 − γ) Tt+1 ,
where cF denotes consumption by financiers and γ controls the utility weight on bequests
relative to own consumption.9 Denoting the end-of-period resources of mature financiers by
F , it is clear that Tt+1 = γFt+1 .
The objective of financiers born at date t reduces then to just maximizing the value of their
end-of-life resources. It is worth emphasizing that the assumptions imposed on the financiers
make them act similarly to a dynasty which maximizes expected wealth every period and
consumes a fix fraction of its resources. The bequest motive is a very simple way of linking
outcomes across time. Although we have assumed that workers to not behave in such a
dynastic fashion, this is again for simplicity as the analysis can be easily extended to include
this possibility.
Since young financiers can access debt markets at the end of the first period to lend, their
budget constraint when young is
0 = f + Tt + pdt dFt
where dF denotes debt issued by young financiers. Market clearing for debt requires that the
total debt of young workers and financiers add to zero, i.e., d+dF = 0. Hence, dF = −d, i.e.,
the debt of young workers must be owed to the young financiers. Using this relationship,
the flow budget constraints facing financiers in each state and period of life are given by
pdt dt = f + Tt ,

(10)

pst+1 sFt+1 + pbt+1 bFt+1 = 0,

(11)

Fgt+1 = sFt+1 + bFt+1 + dt ,

(12)

Fbt+1 = θsFt+1 + bFt+1 + dt ,

(13)

where Fgt+1 denotes financier resources at the end of period t + 1 in the good state when
A = 1 while Fbt+1 denotes resources in the bad state when A = θ. The only limit on asset
positions is that they must satisfy solvency in that Fgt+1 ≥ 0 and Fbt+1 ≥ 0. As we showed
in the one period model, all admissible choices by financiers must satisfy the consolidated
resource constraint for the mature financier in the second period of life given by

Financiers thereby act partially in a dynastic fashion.

19

The portfolio problem facing mature financiers is identical to the one we solved in the oneperiod model earlier. Hence, those solutions apply here. The new aspect in this dynamic
version of the model is the lending by financiers when young. Since they do not consume in
the first period of life, they simply lend their resources in the debt market. Using equation
(10), the debt bought by financiers is given by
dt =

Moreover, goods markets must clear in both the good and bad states. Thus, we must have
cygt + cogt + (1 − γ) Fgt = y + f + lt ,

(15)

cybt + cobt + (1 − γ) Fbt = y + f + θlt .

(16)

The first condition describes market clearing in the good state: total consumption of young
and mature workers, and financiers must exhaust total output in that state. The second
equation is the analogous condition for the bad state.
Lastly, asset market clearing requires that both bond markets and equity market must clear

sFt + sot = St ,

find their allocations to be optimal given prices, and all markets clear.10
In principle, these sequences could depend on the whole history of realizations of At . However, as we shall show, the equilibrium can be represented in recursive form where the level
of debt plays the role of a state variable. In particular, we will show the existence of an
equilibrium transition equation for debt of the form dt = φd (dt−1 , At ), whereby current debt
depends only on past debt and the current realization of the state of nature. Other variables
can then be expressed as functions of debt.

Assumption 3 is more restrictive than needed, but is sufficient for demonstrating the mechanisms that we are interested in.

5.4

Equilibrium Characterization

We now discuss the equilibrium properties of our model economy. We start by describing
the equilibrium allocations. Combining equations (3) and (10) gives consumption of young
workers in each state:
cygt = y + f + γFgt ,
cybt = y + f + γFbt .
The market clearing conditions then directly yield the state contingent consumptions of
mature workers:
cogt = lt − Fgt ,
cobt = θlt − Fbt .
The three key variables of interest in the model are: the level of debt taken on by workers
pb
dt , the employment rate lt and the risk premium captured by pst . Both employment and
t
the risk premium at date t are determined within the period as outcomes of the solution to
equations (7) and (8). This solution is identical to the solutions for employment and the
risk premium in the one-period model that we derived previously. Hence, Propositions 1
and 2 continue to apply here.
The solution for debt, dt , however, depend on both the current state of nature as well as the
initial level of debt, dt−1 . From equation (10) we have pdt dt = f + γFt . From the young
workers’ first order condition for optimal borrowing we also have

The equilibrium evolution of debt in this economy can be derived by combining these two
expressions.

current state of nature (the realization of A) aside from the inherited level of debt. This
is easy to see from the fact that bequests to young financiers, γFt , as well consumption of
young workers, cyt , depend directly on the current state of nature. Hence, both the price of
debt and the level of current debt will depend on the current state of nature as well as the
inherited level of debt.
In view of this dependence, the equilibrium dynamic evolution of debt can be summarized
by a pair of transition equations:
 d
φ (dt−1 , At ) if dt−1 ≤ d˜
dt =
.
φ̃d (dt−1 , At ) if dt−1 > d˜
21

We summarize the key dynamic properties of this economy in the following Proposition:
Proposition 3: The equilibrium evolution of debt is characterized by three key features:
1) For a given state of nature (At = 1 or At = θ), debt at time t is a continuous and weakly
increasing function of dt−1 . For At = 1, debt is strictly increasing in previous debt. For
˜
At = θ, dt = d for dt−1 ≤ d˜ while dt is strictly increasing in dt−1 for dt−1 ≥ d.
¯ 1), and another one for
2) There exists a fixed point for φd (d, 1), denoted by d¯ = φd (d,
φd (d, θ), denoted by d. The debt in this economy will fluctuate within the range d¯ and d.
3) For a given level of dt−1 , dt is always greater after a good realization of the state of nature
than after a bad realization, i.e, φd (dt−1 , 1) > φd (dt−1 , θ) and φ̃d (dt−1 , 1) > φ̃d (dt−1 , θ).
¯
The debt dynamics take the following form: suppose the initial level of debt is some d ∈ [d, d).
If the state of nature is good, then debt will grow. Debt will continue to grow as long as the

is bad, then debt falls. If d¯ < d˜ then it falls immediately to d. If d¯ > d˜ then it can take
several periods of bad outcomes for debt to converge to d. Figure 8 depicts the dynamics for
˜ The solid arrows in the two

figures depict the dynamic behavior of debt in response to good productivity shocks while
the dashed arrows show the response of the economy to a low productivity shock.
Given the results expressed in Propositions 1 and 2, the dynamics for employment and the
risk premium follow easily from Proposition 3. Thus, employment will continuously rise
following a set of good outcomes, but it will drop when a bad state arises. In particular,
˜ it will drop immediately to it lowest level φl (d) following the realization of the
if d¯ < d,
bad state. This implies that the fall in employment will be greater the longer an expansion
period has been. The behavior of the risk premium is a mirror image of employment.
This highlights a key feature of our model. The presence of debt in financier portfolios links
periods and thereby acts as a transmission mechanism for shocks. In good states financiers
accumulate more claims on households (higher d) which raises the level of resources that
they have in the next period to provide insurance cover for risky employment (we call this
risk capital). The presence of risk capital and its dependence on the current state of nature
links adjoining periods and thereby provides a propagation mechanism. A good productivity
shock raises resources of financiers which then translates into more insurance, a lower risk
premium and greater employment tomorrow. Similarly, a transitory negative productivity
shock in any period (say a low θ) translates into low employment in the next period due to
its effect on financier balance sheets today.

An Illustrative Example

In order to illustrate the dynamic evolution of the economy we now present a simple example
where the dis-utility from labor (or equivalently, the technology for home production) is
linear, that is,
g (1 − l) = (1 − l) g ∗ , θ < g ∗ < 1.

Lastly,

which follows directly from the expressions for equilibrium dt in the two cases, along with the
fact that dt is increasing in dt−1 for At = 1. Hence, debt in a good state must be greater than
debt in a bad state. Hence, as long as the economy gets good productivity draws (At = 1),
debt will keep growing along with employment. As soon as a bad productivity shocks hits
the economy, debt will jump down to d as will employment in the following period. The
process will then start up again.

5.6

Discussion of portfolio positions

It is instructive to clarify the evolution of the balance sheet of financiers. When a financier
enters the second period of his life, he initially holds only debt and therefore his balance
sheet looks as follows:
Since this example does not satisfy the Inada condition that g 0 (0) = ∞, it becomes necessary to now
check that given the equilibrium solution for dt−1 , employment is bounded between 0 and 1. For the
purposes of the example, this can be accomplished by appropriate restrictions on g ∗ , q and θ (as well as the
other parameters of the system).

24

Assets Liabilities
dt−1
Own Equity

In general, a risk neutral financiers will not be satisfied with such a balance sheet since his
return on own equity is rather low. To increase his expected return on equity, the financier
transacts on the second period assets market to buy stocks in the amount:

and issues bounds in the amount:

bFt =

After these transactions, a financier’s balance sheet is given by
Assets Liabilities

(Note that in the above the price of bonds are normalized to 1). These transactions in
the asset market allow the financier to construct a leveraged portfolio which gives him an
expected return on equity which is greater than that associated with his initial position.
Furthermore, it can be verified that the resulting return on equity is also higher than simply
holding a pure equity position, which is directly due to the leveraging. Although this new
asset position is more risky, it is preferred by the financier.12
In describing the evolution of the financier asset position, we believe it is informative to
keep track of gross positions rather than immediately netting out dt−1 and bt . In fact, in our
model dt−1 and bt are slightly different as dt−1 represents long term debt, while bt is more
akin to short term debt. Obviously, as they have the same maturity date, they eventually
become perfect substitutes. One advantage of keeping track of these gross position is that
it may better capture actual positions observed in financial markets due to the fact that
many individuals have both short and long positions in debt. If we instead net out the debt
position, the financiers balance sheet will look as below, where we see that the financier has
created a leveraged position in stocks.
12

There are many ways to describe the type of transaction undertaken by financiers. For example, financiers
can be seen as performing a swap between their holdings of household debt from the previous period for
risky equity claims on firms – a type of “debt-equity” swap.

Own Equity

The preceding discussion fleshes out what we believe to be a key role that is played by
financial markets. Financial market do not generally insure workers directly by issuing
state contingent claims, but instead may insure them indirectly. In our set up this is done
by allowing firms to pay workers non-contingent wages, with the financiers picking up most
of the residual risk by buying equity. As opposed to transactions in pure state contingent
assets, actual transactions in the real world are probably better understood as reflecting such
combinations of asset trades. For, example, it is easy with these gross flows to understand
how debt can be viewed as collateral for taking higher leveraged positions in other risky
assets.

5.7

Allowing for consumer durables

Our consumption loan model illustrates how a series of good productivity outcomes can
generate a debt fueled expansion. The debt in the model is pure consumption debt, as
it is used to buy consumption goods and is therefore not backed by any real assets. In
contrast, over the 2002-2008 period, much of the growth in consumer debt was associated
with mortgages and the financing of consumer durables. For this reason it is important
to stress that the insights from the previous propositions also apply to a situation which
allows for consumer durables and where accordingly consumer debt can be interpreted as
asset backed securities. To see this, suppose now that workers when young can use both
own resources and any borrowed resources to buy a consumer durable. Suppose that this
consumer durable has the following properties. It provides one unit of consumption services
in its first period and provides s units of consumption services in its second period (after
a second period, it is assumed to depreciate fully). For simplicity, let us assume that the
production of one unit of consumer durable requires one unit of output, and that the services
of consumer durables are perfectly substitutable for the consumption services of output. In
this case, our previous analysis extends with only minor changes.
The main difference in this case is that the equation for the equilibrium determination of
employment has to be modified. Previously, employment at time t was determined by the
condition

It can be easily verified that our previous characterization for the mapping between inherited
debt and employment (and risk premium) continues to hold in this case. For example, it
is still the case that higher levels of debt dt−1 lead to greater employment and a lower risk
premium. Furthermore, the equilibrium determination of debt dynamics

unchanged in this case as debt at t is still given by pt dt = f + γ g0 (1−lt )−θ if At = 1 and
pdt dt = f if At = θ. Hence, our previous analysis can be seen as applying to a situation
where financiers fund the purchase of consumer durables by young workers, and then use
the resulting debt to build a leveraged position in stocks which favors the expansion of
employment needed to repay the debt. Whether debt is used to purchase durables or nondurables is not central to the mechanism.

Default Risk and Adverse Selection

Thus far we have focused on an environment where all information is available to all agents.
While it was a useful assumption that allowed us to highlight a set of mechanisms, it did
not permit us to study environments in which asset markets may freeze up due to adverse
selection. We turn to this issue now by introducing information heterogeneity into the
model. While the idea that asymmetric information may cause markets to freeze up is well
established, the value added of this section is to illustrate how adverse selection in an asset
market can cause major disruptions in economic activity.
In order to simplify the analysis, in the remainder of the paper we shall maintain the following
assumption which eliminates the need to consider corner situations where the risk premium
is completely eliminated:
˜
Assumption 4: f and y are such that d¯ < d.
Let us now suppose that workers who undertake debt when young may default on this debt
when old. Specifically, let ψ i be the probability that a worker i will have productive market
labor at the beginning of the second period life. Hence, with probability 1 − ψ i worker
i’s labor productivity in market work is zero. Each worker draws a ψ ∈ [0, 1] from an
27

i.i.d. distribution with density f (ψ). Since there is a continuum of workers of unit mass,
the mean of the distribution, E[ψ], is also the expected fraction of workers that will have
a productive market labor. Lastly, assume that the actual productivity of market labor of
a prospective worker is revealed to both the worker and firms just before the labor market
opens. For this reason, there will not be any information problem in the labor market. The
source of asymmetric information will revolve only around asset markets, in particular the
market for existing debt.
In the second period of life, if the worker has productive market labor, then he will behave
as before since this is optimal. If not, he does not work and simply defaults on debt and
gets u(g(1)) as utility.13 Hence, E[ψ] is the expected probability of a young worker not
defaulting on his debt in the second period of life and 1 − ψ i is the probability of default of
worker i.
We assume that each financier’s portfolio of debt brought into a period is characterized by
a specific ψ. This corresponds to an environment where each financier that has debt has
bought it from a continuum of workers with the same ψ, i.e., each financier buys debt from
young workers from a single point in the distribution of ψ.14
Since the quality of outstanding debt is heterogeneous, it is helpful to assume that in every
period asset markets begin operations with the opening of a market for existing debt. In
particular, let us assume that intermediaries can setup and offer to buy up risky debt from
individual financiers in order to pool the different default risks. The assets held by one of
these intermediaries will be equivalent to a synthetic package of debt whose payoff has the
expected repayment rate of the whole distribution of debt sold to it. Financiers can sell their
debt to these intermediaries, while the intermediaries finance themselves by issuing bonds
to households. Note that the overall quality of the portfolio held by the intermediaries will,
in equilibrium, be common knowledge, as all agents will be able to infer who supplied their
debt to the market. Hence, these intermediaries will be able to finance themselves by issuing
risk free bonds. The potential for an adverse selection problem will arise between financiers
and the intermediaries, as we assume that intermediaries cannot directly asses the quality
of debt being sold to it by an individual financier. We denote the average payoff per unit of
debt held by the intermediary by ψ̄.
A financier who sells his debt to an intermediary can use the proceeds to build, as before,
a new portfolio position. In the following we shall denote the price paid by an intermediary
for a unit of debt previously held by a financier to be pk . The total quantity of debt bought
by intermediaries will be denoted by k, and total value of bonds issued to buy the debt is
pk k, as we assume free entry in the intermediary sector.
13

We are assuming that labor continues to be productive in home production even when its market
productivity is zero.
14
This assumption considerably simplifies the analysis, especially the asymmetric information case we
study later. There are alternative ways of setting up the debt portfolio of financiers but they come at the
cost of tractability and algebraic complications.

28

6.1

Symmetric Information

We present here the case where there is heterogeneity across debt quality but no asymmetric
information. In particular, let us assume for now that no one in the asset market knows the
individual ψ of the debt held by financiers (including the financiers themselves). In this case,
we will show that our preceding equilibrium analysis can be carried through with almost no
changes. This section is nevertheless useful for understanding the case with asymmetric
information.
In the first period of life, young workers will recognize the probability of not having a
productive market labor when mature and will take this into account when borrowing. The
constraint faced by workers in the first period of life is still given by equation (3). The
constraints faced by mature workers with productive market labor are also unchanged. Thus,
the optimality conditions for the labor-leisure choice as well as the portfolio choice between
stocks and bonds, equations (7) and (8) respectively, remain unaltered. The first order
condition for optimal borrowing of young workers does change though due to the default
probability. The new condition is given by:



pdt u0 (cyt ) = E[ψ] qu0 cogt+1 + g (1 − lt+1 ) + (1 − q) u0 cobt+1 + g (1 − lt+1 ) .

(17)

The important new element introduced by the presence of default risk is an additional
equilibrium condition for the price of debt bought by financiers. This arbitrage condition
associated with free entry into the intermediary sector is given by:
pkt+1
ψ̄ = b
pt+1

(18)

The budget constraint facing young financiers is unaffected by the introduction of default
risk. For a mature financier who sells his debt to an intermediary, the constraints in the
second period of life are now given by:
pst+1 sFt+1 + pbt+1 bFt+1 = pkt+1 dt ,
Fgt+1 = sFt+1 + bFt+1 ≥ 0,
Fbt+1 = θsFt+1 + bFt+1 ≥ 0.
If the financier does not sell his debt on the market, he has no liquidity to build a new portfolio
and therefore must simply hold his existing debt to maturity. Under the current assumption
that financiers do not know the ψ of their own portfolio, no financier has any incentive to not
sell their debt to the intermediaries. Since all debt gets sold to intermediaries, the average
payoff on the debt held by intermediaries is
Z 1
ψ̄ =
ψf (ψ) dψ = E[ψ].

Moreover, in equilibrium, we must also have the aggregate relationship

6.2

Asymmetric Information

Now we introduce private information into the model. In particular, let us suppose that
mature financiers learn the repayment rate ψ in their portfolios at the beginning of the period
when they enter the asset market. The first thing to note is that when the ψ characterizing
the portfolio of a financier is only known to that financier, there will potentially be an
adverse selection problem in the asset market. Financiers with relatively high quality debt
(low default probability) may have an incentive not to offer their debt on the secondary
30

market since the market will value their debt at the average default rate, which is higher
than the default rate of their portfolio. This implies that only low quality debt may be
offered for sale to intermediaries.
Let us denote by ψ̂ the conjectured quality of debt offered to intermediaries, i.e., the conjectured average repayment rate of the debt that is offered on the market As we saw in
the previous subsection, the zero profit condition for intermediaries implies that the market
price of the debt offered on the market is given by
pkt
= ψ̂
pbt
The problem facing mature workers remains unaffected by this new environment relative
to the symmetric information case analyzed above. For financiers however, the problem
changes. Every financier now has to make a choice about whether or not he wants to offer
his debt holdings to intermediaries. How will financiers decide whether to sell their debt or
to keep it? For a given conjecture ψ̂, the budget constraint facing a financier i with debt
type ψ i who decides to place his debt on the market is

holding on to it:

Recall that if ppb = E[A] then financiers are indifferent between all combinations that satisfy their budget

placed on the market by financiers and on which they get repaid by mature workers with
productive market labor. As ψ m goes to one this term becomes vanishingly small and the
consumption levels c̃ogt and c̃obt tend to approach those under symmetric information.
32

Equations (20) and (21) jointly define the equilibrium for this economy at every date t in
terms of ψtm and lt as a function of the inherited stock of debt dt−1 . The equilibrium
values of all the other endogenous variables can then be recovered recursively using these
two solutions for ψtm , lt and the initial level of debt dt−1 . For future reference, we denote
the solutions for equilibrium employment and the risk premium ps /pb as

In general, there can be multiple solutions to the equilibrium system of equations (20)
and (21). Below we illustrate the potential multiple equilibria by describing alternative
equilibria.
6.2.1

Pessimistic Equilibrium: ψ m = 0

In this model economy there always exists an equilibrium in which ψ m = 0. We call this the
“pessimistic” equilibrium, as it corresponds to the case where the market interprets any offer
of debt as reflecting the worse type of debt, that is debt with a zero expected repayment rate.
Since this equilibrium always exists, we will begin by characterizing it. In the pessimistic
equilibrium, the asset market available to mature financiers breaks down in the sense that
financiers do not trade their debt on this market. Thus, they have no liquidity to build a
new portfolio. Hence it must be workers that buy all the risky claims supplied by firms
looking to finance working capital.
Proposition 4: There always exists a pessimistic equilibrium where ψ m = 0 and the asset
holdings S and b of financiers are zero.
We next summarize the response of equilibrium employment to changes in initial debt and
contrast this equilibrium with that in the autarkic case with no financiers. The main element to notice in Proposition 5 is that the debt-employment relationship in the pessimistic
equilibrium is almost the exact opposite of the one derived in Proposition 1.
Proposition 5: The pessimistic equilibrium is characterized by employment being a decreasing function of dt−1 . Moreover, for all dt−1 > 0, employment is lower than in autarky.
The reason why employment is low and is a decreasing function of debt in the pessimistic
equilibrium, is that now the presence of debt increases the risk premium. This occurs
because workers, who are the agents that determine the risk premium at the margin, dislike
risk even more when they are more indebted and no one is willing to insure them against
bad aggregate outcomes. Effectively, workers have no insurance against fluctuating labor
income but have to repay a larger debt when dt−1 is higher. Hence, their net risk exposure
becomes higher with higher dt−1 . The market response is for employment to decrease as
labor time is shifted to the safe home production technology g (1 − l). The important new
33

aspect is that the equilibrium mapping between debt and employment is decreasing, that is
more debt leads to lower employment, as stated in Proposition 6.
Proposition 6: In the pessimistic equilibrium current debt is an increasing function of past
debt and is independent of the current state. Moreover, there is a unique steady state level
¯
of debt in this equilibrium, dp , and dp < d.
A key feature of Proposition 6 is that the evolution of debt is not affected by the current
state. This has an important implication for the dependence of current employment on
past states of nature. Since mature financiers do not acquire any risky claims, their end-ofperiod resources are E[ψ]dt−1 in both states (their portfolio is concentrated entirely in safe
claims). This implies that their bequests to young financiers are also not dependent on the
current state. Hence, resources available to young financiers to lend to young workers every
period are f + γE[ψ]dt−1 which too is independent of the current state. Thus, in the pessimistic equilibrium, current employment becomes independent of the state in the previous
period. High productivity shocks today do not translate into high employment tomorrow
since transitory productivity shocks are no longer propagated across periods. Clearly, if the
economy gets stuck in the pessimistic equilibrium with low employment, a sequence of good
productivity shocks will not necessarily lift the economy out of it.
To summarize, in the presence of asymmetric information, there always exists a pessimistic
equilibrium in which the market for debt breaks down due to adverse selection induced
“market for lemons” problem. Relative to the symmetric information case, in the pessimistic
equilibrium employment is lower and the risk premium is higher. Moreover, both the
evolution of debt and employment become non-state contingent in this equilibrium.
6.2.2

Optimistic equilibrium: ψ m = 1

Next we turn to the potential existence of other equilibria. Conditional on existence, one
potential equilibrium is particularly interesting. This is the one where the market becomes
optimistic and all mature financiers choose to offer their debt on the market, i.e., ψ m = 1. In
this subsection we ask whether this equilibrium can exist and, if so, under what conditions.
Recall that a financier with type ψ i debt would choose to sell his debt on the market if and
only if
q(1 − θ)ψ̂t

pst

where ψ̂ is the conjectured average quality of debt sold on the market. Combining this with

Condition 1:

> 1.

Proposition 7: As long as Condition 1 holds there will always exist an optimistic equilibrium with ψ m = 1.
Clearly, for the optimistic equilibrium with ψ m = 1 to exist the density function of debt
types f (·) must have sufficient mass concentrated near 1, so that Condition 1 is satisfied.
The optimistic equilibrium is characterized by full pooling of default risk by all financiers
and the market behaves as if there was no asymmetric information. Hence, the endogenous
variables of the model behave exactly as in the previously analyzed case of a given exogenous
default probability and symmetric information. We call this the optimistic equilibrium as
it resembles the equilibrium without adverse selection.16
6.2.3

An Example

We now provide a simple example to illustrate the mechanics of the model under asymmetric
information. Assume that
g (1 − lt ) = (1 − lt ) g ∗ ,
where g ∗ > 0 is a positive constant. This makes the home production technology linear in
its labor input (or equivalently, it makes the utility from leisure linear in time). The direct
implication of this assumption is that ps /pb = g ∗ is now a constant as is the risk premium.
Hence, the consistency condition (equation 20) is sufficient to pin down the equilibrium ψ m .
All other endogenous variables at date t can then be determined recursively as functions of
ψtm , dt−1 and At .
It is easy to see that the logic of the multiple equilibria described above continues to apply.
ψ m = 0 is always a solution to equation (20) which implies that the pessimistic equilibrium
always exists. The relevant condition for the optimistic equilibrium to exist can now be
written as
ψ̄ ≥

g∗ − θ
.
q(1 − θ)

This amounts to a restriction on the parameters and the density function since
ψ̄.

ψf (ψ)dψ =

More generally, under adverse selection there are many possible equilibrium configurations. Whether
or not these arise depend on the parameter configuration and the properties of the density function f (.).

As a specific case, assume that f (ψ) follows a uniform distribution in the interval [0, 1].
Define

6.2.4

A Scenario: Debt Fueled Expansion and Financial Crisis

We now use our previous results to sketch out one potential scenario that could emerge
in the context of our model. Suppose we are in Case 2, i.e., q(1−θ)
> 2. Hence, there
g ∗ −θ
36

are two equilibria. Recall that in the optimistic equilibrium with complete risk pooling
by financiers, good productivity shocks (A = 1) will imply greater debt creation today and
higher employment and debt tomorrow. A bad productivity shock would lead to debt falling
to d and then start rising again in response to good states or staying at d in bad states.
¯ Assume that the economy
Suppose our model economy starts off with some debt d0 < d.
is initially in the optimistic equilibrium. A sequence of good productivity shocks will thus
induce rising debt and rising employment. Now suppose that at some date t there is an
abrupt switch in expectations to pessimism: financiers conjecture that the debt being offered
on the market is of the worst possible type, i.e., ψ̂ = 0. This will immediately lead to the
economy switching to the pessimistic equilibrium in which the market for existing debt will
freeze up. Consequently, financiers will simply hold their debt to maturity and there will be
no insurance on offer for risky production. The increasing riskiness of market employment
will induce a precipitous decline in employment below even the autarky level.
One way of thinking about a map between our model and financial crisis episodes is to view
the switch in the equilibrium from the optimistic to the pessimistic as the financial crisis
episode. Viewed through this lens, a financial crisis episode in our structure is particularly
debilitating because, as long as the economy stays in the pessimistic equilibrium, good
productivity shocks are not going to help raise employment and expected output. Moreover,
in this equilibrium, creating more debt will now make the employment situation even worse
as workers will be faced with bigger repayment obligations but no insurance against risky
labor income. Thus, a financial crisis in our model can have very large negative effects on
employment even if the economy is fortunate enough not to have bad productivity shocks.

6.3

Allowing for consumer durables

As we discussed in the previous section, extending our model to allow for consumer durables
did not significantly change the results in the absence of worker heterogeneity. In the presence
of worker heterogeneity and adverse selection, does this still remain the case? The answer
depends on what a financier can recover from a worker who defaults on his debt. To see
this, let us first consider the extreme case where the financier cannot recover anything from
a defaulting worker (for example, this would be the case if the foreclosure process is very
costly). In such a case, it can be verified that the extension of the model to allowing consumer
durable has again no substantial impact on the analysis. In contrast, if the financier could
recover the full value of his debt by appropriating the durable goods of a defaulting worker,
then the adverse selection problem would not arise. Hence, the key element determining the
relevance of the adverse selection problem is not whether debt is used to finance consumer
durables, but is instead whether the consumer durables can be used to pay back all the debt
or whether the real backing of the debt relies mainly on the workers income. Given that the
foreclosure process is viewed as generally very costly, we believe that a substantial fraction
of debt is primarily supported by the capacity of the borrower to repay using his income
stream, in which case the adverse selection problem described previously can emerge.

Productive Investment Projects

In our presentation of motivating facts, we documented that non-residential investment
was quite weak over the period 2002-2007 despite low interest rates, low risk premium and
high profits. We interpreted this observation as indicating that productive risky investment
opportunities were likely quite scarce over this period. In response to this observation, in
our model we did not include any option for agents to invest in productive capital in order
to illustrate how an economy may function when profits are high and productive investment
opportunities are scarce. As we have shown, this leads to a type of risk capital glut whereby
risk tolerant individuals try to both lend and insure risk averse households in order to
generate a risky portfolio position which has a higher expected return.
In this section we briefly discuss how our results relate to our assumption that productive
(but risky) investment opportunities are scarce. To this end, consider an extension of our
baseline model where output now depends not just on employment but also on previous
investment in physical capital, denoted by Kt . For simplicity, let us assume that production
takes the following form: yt = At lt + Jt Kt , where in the good state (with probability q),
At = 1 and Jt = J while in the bad state At = θ and Jt = 0. The capital stock Kt arises
from output invested at the end of period t − 1, and it lasts for one period. The case where
J = 0 corresponds to our previous analysis. What happens if J > 0? Obviously, the answer
depends on the value of J. If J is sufficiently small, then this investment opportunity is not
attractive and it can be verified that the previous analysis remains unchanged. However if J
is sufficiently large, then the equilibrium behavior can be quite different. We illustrate this
using the case without any default risk. Proposition 8 summarizes the main implications of
allowing for highly productive real investment opportunities in that version of the model.
¯ such
Proposition 8: When output takes the form yt = At lt + Jt Kt , there exist a J,
that if J ≥ J¯ then equilibrium behavior is characterized by: (1) young financiers investing
all their resources into capital accumulation, and there is no debt accumulation (financiers
do not lend to workers). Moreover, financiers simply hold this asset to maturity; and (2)
Employment and the risk premium are constant over time.
Proposition 8 indicates that the behavior of an economy may depend heavily on the availability of risky physical investment opportunities. In the case where such opportunities are
scarce (as we argued was the case over the 2002-2007 period), the economy may go through
a debt fueled expansion that can crash either due to bad profit outcomes (A = θ) or, even
worse, due to the emergence of adverse selection which causes the asset market to freeze. In
contrast, if risky investment opportunities are abundant and productive, then such a scenario
is much less likely. The economy would still be subject to fluctuations, but such fluctuations
have much less effect on employment since employment is not as reliant on the availability
¯
of risk capital to insure workers. For example, in the case of our model economy with J ≥ J,
fluctuations would affect investment and output, but not employment.
While we believe this to be an extreme illustration, this comparison suggests that different
cyclical episodes may have very different characteristics depending on the force driving the
expansion. If the expansion is driven by good physical investment opportunities – as was
38

likely the case in the 1990s – the subsequent contraction may be quite different than in the
case where the expansion is instead driven by a “glut” of risk taking capital.

Conclusion

In this paper we have provided a description of an economic environment in which (a) there
is systemic aggregate risk; and (b) there is heterogeneity across agents in terms of their risk
tolerance. Our model has focused on two key functions of financial markets: they facilitate
lending to households for consumption smoothing purposes and they provide insurance to
risk averse agents by shifting production risk to agents with greater risk tolerance. We
have shown that in this environment, good productivity shocks can lead to more resources
with financiers which, in turn, facilitates greater lending to households and more insurance
provisions by these financial intermediaries for risky production as the risk premium declines.
Crucially, the resources available to financier act as a form of risk capital which links current
states to future economic activity. Hence, financial markets tend to propagate transitory
productivity shocks over time through this risk capital.
We have also shown how the presence of default risk and private information with financial
intermediaries regarding the default rates on their debt portfolios gives rise to an adverse
selection problem in asset market. This can easily lead to multiple equilibria which are
sensitive to expectations. Pessimism about the quality of assets on offer in asset markets
can lead to a freezing of transactions – a financial crisis – and low employment while optimism
about the average quality of assets in the market can give rise to an equilibrium with high
employment which resembles one with no adverse selection at all. Financial crises in our
model are thus associated with a switch in expectations from optimism to pessimism. These
crises are associated with precipitous falls in employment and a shutting down of insurance
markets. Perhaps, most strikingly, once an economy gets into the pessimistic equilibrium,
productivity shocks are no longer transmitted across periods. Hence, the economy can be
stuck in a low employment phase for long periods of time despite continual good productivity
realizations.
We have argued that this model provides a candidate description of important underlying
forces behind both the financial crisis of 2008 and the prior expansion during the 20012007 period which saw rising output and debt/GDP ratios, falling risk premia, and high
productivity. While this model clearly omits many elements relevant during this episode, we
believe the margins isolated in this paper offer an insight into the deeper or more fundamental
causes.

ps /pb = g 0 (1 − l) which leads to the solution for ˜l. The solution for d˜ then follows directly from
the equilibrium relationship l = φl (d). The result that φl (d) > la follows trivially from the fact
that φl is increasing in d and that d = 0 in the autarkic case.

where Ft and cyt are dependent on the realization of A at date t. Combining the last two equations
and substituting in the allocations for Ft and cyt in each of the two states yields four difference

We shall denote this implicit solution for lt by φ̃l (Wt ) .
Throughout the following analysis we shall maintain Assumption 3 (see Section 5.3 above) so that
preferences are given by
u(x) = log x.
First, consider the case where At = 1. In this event one can combine the three equilibrium
conditions above along with the equilibrium allocations for Ft and cyt in the good state to get

Second, recall that from expression 2 (the equilibrium difference equation when A = θ) above that
dt is independent of dt−1 when At = θ.
Next, straight forward differentiation of the equilibrium difference equations governing the system
when dt−1 > d˜ (the third and fourth equilibrium difference equations described at the beginning
t
of this section above) shows that ddddt−1
> 0 in both cases. This completes the proof of part 1 of
Proposition 3. Part 3 follows trivially from part 2.
For part 2 of the Proposition we start by noting that the fixed point for the equilibrium map under
A = 1 and dt−1 < d˜ is derived by first solving for W̄ from the expression

ωt+1 must equal one somewhere in the interior of this range for Wt as Wt+1 is continuous. Hence,
there always exists such a fixed point.

The equilibrium transition equation for dt when A = θ is independent of dt−1 (see the second
difference equation at the beginning of this appendix). The solution to this expression is also the
fixed point for this mapping d. The fixed points for the equilibrium mappings from dt−1 to dt when
dt−1 > d˜ are determined analogously from the corresponding difference equations described above.

A.4

Proof of Proposition 4

The consistency condition given by equation (20) is trivially satisfied when ψ m = 0. Employment,
for a given debt level dt−1 , is now given implicitly by
g 0 (1 − lt ) =

qu0 (lt − E[ψ]dt−1 + g(1 − lt )) + (1 − q)θu0 (θlt − E[ψ]dt−1 + g(1 − lt ))
.
qu0 (lt − E[ψ]dt−1 + g(1 − lt )) + (1 − q)u0 (θlt − E[ψ]dt−1 + g(1 − lt ))

(23)

This has a well defined solution lp given by
ltp = φ̃l (dt−1 , 0) .

A.5

Proof of Proposition 5

The proof is straightforward as it follows from differentiating equation (23) with respect to lt and
∂ltp
dt−1 and using the implicit function theorem to get ∂dt−1
< 0. The second statement implies that
∂lp

t
la ≥ ltp for all t. This follows directly from the fact that ∂dt−1
< 0 and that dt−1 > 0 when both
financiers and workers coexist while dt−1 = 0 corresponds to the autarkic case.

A.6

Proof of Proposition 6

The dynamics of debt in this case are given by
dt =

f + γE[ψ]dt−1
,
pdt

where pdt is determined by


pdt u0 (y + f + γE[ψ]dt−1 ) = E[ψ] qu0 (lt+1 − dt + g (1 − lt+1 )) + (1 − q) u0 (θlt+1 − dt + g (1 − lt+1 )) .
This gives an implicit mapping between dt = φdp (dt−1 ). From the previous two equations it is clear
that this transition equation is not state contingent. Straightforward differentiation shows dt is
increasing in dt−1 .

A.7

Proof of Proposition 7

The proof follows directly by combining Condition 1 with the condition under
which the financier
pst
with the highest quality debt sells his debt on the market – q(1 − θ)ψ̄ ≥ pb − θ.

44

A.8

Proof of Proposition 8

Begin by defining a J¯ using the following condition:
J¯ =

u0 (y)
qu0 (la + g(1 − la ))

where la is the autarky level of employment. Furthermore, let KtF represent the amount of resources
invested into capital accumulation by young financiers at time t − 1, and let KtW represent the
amount of resources invested into capital accumulation by young workers at time t − 1. For the
¯ the equilibrium determination of lt and KtW is given by the following two time
case where J ≥ J,
invariant conditions:

J=
and
g 0 (1 − l) =

u0 (y − K w )

¯ w + g(1 − l)
qu0 l + JK

qu0 (l + JK w + g(1 − l)) + (1 − q)θu0 (θl + g(1 − l))
.
qu0 (l + JK W + g(1 − l)) + (1 − q)u0 (θl + g(1 − l))

Furthermore, the equilibrium behavior is characterized by no trade in asset markets, as financiers
invest all their resources in capital accumulation. This lead to a simple dynamic equation for KtF ,
F
where by KtF = f + γJKt−1
when the good state arise at time t − 1, and KtF = f when the
bad state arises at t − 1. To check that this constitutes an equilibrium, one can verify that these
allocations satisfy the financiers and the workers’ optimality conditions when asset prices are given
¯ employment and risk premium are
by the marginal conditions of the workers. Hence, when J ≥ J,
constant over time and financiers do not lend to workers.
