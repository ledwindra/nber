The 'Volume 30' series, reported as decadal averages, underlie much of what we know about American income growth and capital formation before 1909. This paper briefly documents Gallman's construction and use of the annual series, offers corrections for minor errors found in the previously circulated versions, compares the series with alternative national product estimates, and explores promising avenues for further research. Most importantly, this paper lays out why Gallman considered his annual 'Volume 30' series unsuitable for business-cycle analysis.\n\n",
