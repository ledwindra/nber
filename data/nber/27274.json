    "abstract": "\n\nUS antitrust authorities are only notified of large mergers, so most transactions could escape antitrust scrutiny. I study premerger notification exemptions in the dialysis industry. I find that, in sharp contrast to reportable mergers, exempt ones almost completely avoid enforcement. As a result, exempt mergers increase concentration and reduce healthcare quality, as measured by hospitalization and mortality rates. I then estimate a structural model to simulate the equilibrium response of demand, quality, and enforcement to the elimination of exemptions. I find that the benefits of eliminating exemptions in the dialysis industry far exceed the costs.\n\n",
