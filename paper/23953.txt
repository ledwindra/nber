ABSTRACT
We document the representation of female economists on the conference programs at the NBER
Summer Institute from 2001-2016. Over the period from 2013-2016, women made up 20.6
percent of all authors on scheduled papers. However, there was large dispersion across programs,
with the share of female authors ranging from 7.3 percent to 47.7 percent. While the average
share of women rose slightly from 18.5% since 2001-2004, a persistent gap between finance,
macroeconomics and microeconomics subfields remains, with women consisting of 14.4 percent
of authors in finance, 16.3 percent of authors in macroeconomics, and 25.9 percent of authors in
microeconomics. We examine three channels potentially affecting female representation. First,
using anonymized data on submissions, we show that the rate of paper acceptance for women is
statistically indistinguishable to that of men. Second, we find that the share of female authors is
comparable to the share of women amongst all tenure-track professors, but is ten percentage
points lower than the share of women among assistant professors. Finally, within conference
program, we find that when a woman organizes the program, the share of female authors and
discussants is higher.

Introduction

Substantial work focuses on the representation of women and minorities in economics departments.1
This paper provides an alternative approach to examine the representation of women in economics,
using a hand-collected panel dataset to measure the share of female authors represented on the program at the National Bureau of Economics Research (NBER) Summer Institute conference between
2001 and 2016. We use these data to measure female representation across both time and subfields.
We focus on conference representation for two reasons. First, opportunities to present at major conferences are valuable in academia – they increase the visibility of new work, provide efficient
means to receive feedback from audiences of peers and facilitate collaborative networking (Kalejta
and Palmenberg, 2017; Casadevall and Handelsman, 2014; Casadevall, 2015). For younger scholars,
presentations at conferences constitute prestige and enhanced visibility and may be critical to professional advancement. Promotion and tenure committees often use conference presentations as metrics
of external recognition. Measuring the prominence of women at conferences can, therefore, provide
insight into the representation of female economists in this vital component of the academic process.
Second, data from a large and high-profile conference like the NBER Summer Institute also provide a
novel look at gender representation across subfields of economics.
The Summer Institute is an annual three-week conference hosted by the NBER. The conference
is a highly visible forum that showcases latest research advances across many sub-disciplines in economics. According to data from the NBER, the most recent meetings attracted 2,763 registered participants from 440 academic and policy institutions around the world. The conference hosts many
different programs under the broad themes of finance, macroeconomics, and microeconomics. Each
program is organized by a set of NBER-affiliated economists who select papers that appear on the
agenda.
We construct a rich panel dataset of these conference programs from 2001 to 2016, that contains
information on the selected papers, their authors, and the organizers of the program. In addition,
for sessions with discussants, the data include discussant names. We then identify the gender of the
authors, discussants and the organizers. With these data, we first present basic summary statistics
about the share of female authors in the time series and across fields.2 We find that the share of female
1 Alternative approaches analyze representation on other dimensions such as publications, e.g., Hamermesh (2013) for an
example.
2 An important caveat to our work is we are not able to identify which of the authors presented, nor who necessarily
attended the conference. Our measures will reflect the share of women as authors on papers.

authors ticks upwards slightly over the sixteen-year period, from roughly 18.5 percent in 2001-2004
to 20.6 percent in 2013-2016. The Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession
(CSWEP) has done similar work to survey the overall representation of women in economics departments, and we can compare our numbers to CSWEP’s annual reports to compare the NBER to the
overall economics profession. On average, the share of female authors at the Summer Institute falls
below the share of female assistant professors relative to all assistant professors but, is generally above
the overall share of women in all tenure-track positions.
In contrast to CSWEP statistics, our data allow us to move beyond the time series and examine the
representation of women across subfields of economics. Indeed, a striking feature of previous work
on gender and economics is that it presents economic subfields as a monolith. Far from being homogenous, we find that an economist attending the first week of the Summer Institute in 2016, a week
dominated by finance and macroeconomics programs, 17.5 percent of the authors on papers presented
were women. In contrast, the third week of papers, a week focused on labor and public economics,
had almost twice as many women on the program; 30.5 percent of the authors were women.
We disaggregate the data into three broad categories: applied micro, finance, and macro & international, and find that the representation of women across the subfields varies substantially. In
finance, the share of women is roughly 14.4 percent; in macro & international, it is slightly higher,
around 16.4 percent; and in micro, the share is highest, with 25.9 percent of female authors. Moreover,
we find that the growth rates across these subfields are roughly the same over the sixteen-year period.
This suggests that despite overall growth in the share of women in economics, the aggregate statistics
mask important underlying heterogeneity across sub-disciplines over the past sixteen years.
These differences across subfields prompt us to examine three channels that could potentially affect female representation. First, using anonymized data on submissions in 2016 and 2017, we find
that the rate of acceptance for women who submit papers to the NBER Summer Institute is statistically indistinguishable from that of men. Across the three subfields of finance, micro, and macro &
international, we find that while micro and macro & international have statistically indistinguishable
rates between men and women, women in finance have a 2 percentage point lower probability of a
paper acceptance when compared to men in finance (t-stat = -1.63). Second, we study the correlation
between the gender of the program organizer and the share of women on the program. We find that
the share of female economists on a given program is higher when a woman is an organizer. However,
we cannot fully rule out reverse causality, namely that as the share of women increases, more women

2

are organizers and featured on the program.
Lastly, we focus on the program discussants selected directly by the organizers. We find that in
sessions with discussions, the share of female discussants is similar to the share of female authors.
Across sub-fields, differences in female representation on the discussant dimension are also similar to
cross-sectional differences in patterns of female authors on programs. Organizers have sole discretion
to select discussants based on the papers chosen for the program. While the underlying pool of submissions determines the subset of papers chosen for the program, discussant selection is not subject to
the same constraint. Hence, the selection likely reflect the organizers’ information set of appropriate
discussants. Here too we find that female organizers are also more likely to select female discussants.
The share of women in the profession and on the program at the Summer Institute could vary for
a variety of reasons. For instance, women could submit at different rates to the Summer Institute; or
women could submit papers of differential quality; or there could be differences in acceptance rates
by gender. While we cannot speak to the submission rates of women to the NBER, we do find that
conditional on submissions, there are no systematic differences between the acceptance rates across
gender (and across subfields). This suggests that women are not systematically submitting lower
quality papers, nor are there differences in acceptance rates across subfields.3
Our results tie into a large literature that studies the representation of women in economics. Much
of this work focuses on the representation of women among faculty and the differential rates of tenure
across genders [(Ginther and Kahn, 2004; Kahn, 1995; Bayer and Rouse, 2016)]. Hamermesh (2013) also
shows the share of female economists published in top economics journals. Fewer papers study the
representation of minorities as a whole: Bayer and Rouse (2016) and Price (2009) are a few exceptions.
Focusing on the representation of African-American economists, Price (2009) argues that departments
in fact systematically hire fewer new African American Ph.D.s, and lack of representation of African
Americans amongst faculty is, in fact, a demand, not supply, problem. In 2015, to address the clear
differences in gender representation in finance, the American Finance Association (AFA) founded the
Academic Female Finance Committee (AFFECT) to study the causes of low female representation
in finance, following the lead of CSWEP. Their results suggest that, similar to the results found by
CSWEP, a “leaky pipeline” occurs in advancing from Ph.D. programs to the highest levels. The report
argues that in fact “there are many qualified women who are less recognized for potential high-level
3 The

fact that the acceptance rates across genders is statistically similar could be consistent with two hypotheses of
organizers favoring either male or female authors “just enough,” regardless of the quality of the submissions. While the
data do not allow us to distinguish between these two competing hypotheses, Occam’s razor suggests that it is more likely
that the quality across gender of submitted papers is identical.

Our work is new in two ways: first, we focus on a well-known and large conference over a long
time series, which provides an alternative perspective on the visibility of women in the profession.
Second, using the large scale of the conference, we examine heterogeneity across economic subfields
at the Summer Institute. This setting provides a novel quantification of female representation across
subfields.
The gender representation differences we document across subfields leads to the larger question
of why these differences exist. Economists use a toolset that works across different aspects of the discipline; unlike many of the sciences, economists have the technical skills to work on different economics
topics over the course of their careers. The barriers to entry across these topics are thus presumably
lower conditional on acquiring the economics toolset in a Ph.D. program. Hence, the balkanization
of economics concerning gender is puzzling. Given the equal rates of acceptance across the topics,
differences in either submission rates – women submitting fewer papers than men – or overall representation in the field could drive differences in gender representation across fields. It remains an
open question what features of applied micro fields make them more attractive to female economists.
Goldin (2013) speculates that there may be features of the way that economics is taught that may encourage or discourage women to become economics majors – the same may apply to teaching Ph.D.
students and influencing their choice of subfields within economics.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the NBER Summer Institute dataset in detail along with a description of the names matching algorithm we use to identify gender. Section 3
presents the empirical results. We begin by describing the time-series patterns in the data followed
by an analysis of the cross-sectional patterns across subfields. We also provide a benchmark for our
findings using data from CSWEP and examine submission patterns across gender. Finally, we explore
the role of organizers and the observed patterns for the gender composition of discussants. Section
4 concludes with a discussion of steps taken in a number of STEM disciplines to address the issue of
gender imbalances on scientific conference programs.

Background & Data

The NBER Summer Institute is a high-profile annual conference held over the course of three weeks
in July, showcasing the latest research advances across many subfields in economics. The conference

hosts many different programs, with each program’s papers selected by a set of economists affiliated
with the NBER. These programs are publicly available on the NBER website.5 We construct a panel
dataset of these conference programs from 2001 to 2016, containing information on the papers presented, their authors, the discussant of the paper, and the organizers of the program.
To collect the data, we used a webscraping program to compile information for each of the sessions. This exercise results in 6,513 papers and 16,858 authors and discussants over the sample period.
However, due to issues with the formatting of the NBER website, an additional 625 papers were input
by hand. This gives an initial total of 7,138 papers and 18,535 authors and discussants. After further
data cleaning due to a few webscraping issues, 743 papers were dropped.6 We were left with a final
total of 6,867 papers and 17,474 authors and discussants across the 16-year period (2001-2016).7
Next, we identify the gender of the authors in two steps. First, we use a database constructed
by Tang et al. (2011), who used Facebook to assemble data on first names and self-reported genb (male|name) and
der.8 We construct a measure of the probability of male and female names (Pr
b (female|name)). We then merge this database with the list of authors from the NBER. We mark
Pr
b (male|name) > 0.95 as male, and authors with Pr
b (female|name) > 0.95 as female.
authors with Pr
For the remaining names, either because we have lower probability values or because the Facebook
database does not include a name, we manually identify the author’s gender.9 Of the 7,215 distinct
authors in our dataset, 5,604 authors are automatically identified and 1,611 are manually identified.
To assure ourselves of the quality of the gender identification procedure, we also manually identify the gender of all participants in 2016 and verify the accuracy of the gender for names marked with
a probability greater than 95 percent. We find that 99.5% of those marked automatically as male by the
algorithm are male, and 97.38% of those marked automatically as female by the algorithm are female.
In total, the algorithm only mislabels nine names in 2016.
We also use anonymized aggregated data on submissions to the 2016 and 2017 NBER Summer
Institute to disentangle the share of accepted papers and the overall proportion of female economists

including the university name as
an author name). Additionally, to consistently compare presentations of post-Ph.D. researchers, we drop egg timer sessions
and mini poster sessions since these sessions are usually done by current PhD students.
7 We do our best to clean and regularize the data, but it is possible that errors still exist in the data. Given the large number
of observations, and the fact that these errors are unlikely to be correlated with gender, these errors ought not substantially
impact our estimates.

9 Manual identification consists of searching for the author’s name and affiliation and using any gendered text to identify
the economist (e.g. “She is a leader in the field of...”). Alternatively, we use the economist’s photo to identify gender. If
neither are available, we omit the author. This only occurs in a handful of cases.
6 First, we drop entries where the webscraper incorrectly identifies the author name (e.g.

submitting to the Summer Institute. The submissions data provide a metric to compare the acceptance
rate of papers authored by gender to the submissions rate. In order to preserve anonymity, submissions data were reported in an aggregated format to the subfield level (finance, macro & international,
and micro) by the NBER to us.10 To make our results comparable, we use these sub-disciplines in
other components of our analysis. For those programs that are not categorized, we omit them from
our analysis when focusing on the sub-disciplines.
We compile two additional datasets to construct a set of comparison benchmarks of female representation in economics. First, we use data from the Council on the Status of Women in the Economics
Profession (CSWEP) Reports. Since 1993, CSWEP conducts surveys of economics departments to measure gender composition of faculty across ranks (assistant, associate, etc.), as well as across institution
type and rank (graduate program vs not, and Top 10/20 vs. all programs). We compiled the data from
these reports to construct two sets of statistics: first, the overall share of each rank (assistant, associate,
full professor) at the institutions, across both men and women;

11

and second, the time series on the

share of female professors at different levels of seniority for three sets of types of universities: Top
10, Top 20 and “All” economics departments with a graduate program, where in the most recent time
periods, “All” refers to 126 departments surveyed by CSWEP.12
Second, we compile all NBER members since 1978 from the NBER website.13 We then identify
the gender of each member using the method described above. Out of 2,450 members, 2,368 members
are automatically identified and 268 are manually identified. The final NBER membership dataset
includes name, appointment date, program, NBER affiliation, and gender. For the purposes of our
analysis, we will focus primarily on the stock of NBER members from 2001-2016. We also disaggregate
the authors into our three major subfields.

Empirical Results

In this section, we first present basic summary statistics on the share of female authors in the time
series and across subfields. We then examine potential channels driving differential rates of female
authorship on the programs.

categorizations were chosen with consultation of the NBER and are reported in Table 1.
scaled the number of women by the share of women to get the overall number of faculty in each position, and then
scale by the total number of faculty.

Time Series

In Figure 1, we plot the share of female authors over time divided into four year bins to smooth
out year-to-year fluctuations in gender share.14 Panel A reports the share of female authors across all
papers. The figure shows that the share of female authors increases over time, growing from 18 percent
in 2001-2004 to slightly over 20 percent in 2013-2016. For each bar, the whiskers plot the 95 percent
confidence intervals for the means. Panel B shows the composition of authors across accepted papers
broken into three categories: papers with (i) all male authors, (ii) all female authors, and (iii) a mix of
male and female authors. While the share of all male and all female authored papers declines over
time, the share of papers with both female and male coauthors comprises a rising share of accepted
papers. As a result, roughly 40 percent of all accepted papers include at least one female co-author in
2016.
To explain the divergence in the female share of the total number of authors and the share of
papers with at least one woman, we examine the number of co-authors per paper over time. Appendix
Figure A2 shows that the number of co-authors on each paper rises substantially over time, growing
from 1.8 in 2001 to almost 2.5 co-authors per paper in 2016. If we assume a fixed percentage share of
female authors and no assortative matching of coauthors based on gender, as the number of coauthors
on a paper rises, there is a mechanical effect of increasing the probability of having a paper with at
least one woman. This is notable in that while the share of papers with a single woman increased over
this time period, the movement in the overall share of women is significantly lower.
To more directly study the composition of authorship, we breakdown the share of female authorship across papers with different numbers of coauthors – papers with one, two, three, and four
or more coauthors from 2001 to 2016. In Panel A of Figure 2, we first see that the number of soleauthored papers declined substantially over this period, while three- or four-authored papers grow in
their stead. However, in Panel B, we see that there is no particular gender pattern across these papers.
Sole-authored papers do not have a larger share of women than four-authored papers. This finding is
consistent with a mechanical effect of more coauthors leading to a larger share of papers with at least
one female author.
14 We

report year-by-year results in the Appendix.

3.2

Time Series by Field

Next, we document the growth in authorship within subfields. As discussed in Section 2, we categorize programs into three subfields: finance, macro & international and micro. Table 1 shows the
categorization of different programs into these three broad fields. Figure 3 decomposes the share of female authors over time into these categories and shows significant cross-sectional variation in gender
representation across fields. In Panel A, we first plot the share of female authors. In 2013-2016, finance
has the lowest representation at 14.3%, macro & international is slightly higher, with 16.3% female
authors, and micro has a much higher share of women overall at 25.8%. Growth rates over the period
are similar across fields, with very modest growth across all three subfields. Finance grew from 13.3%
in 2001-2004, macro & international from 14.4% and micro from 23.5%. Again, the whiskers plot the
95% confidence intervals for the sample means. As expected, finance has larger standard errors due
to a smaller share of papers in this subfield.15 Panel B charts the gender composition shares of papers.
Here we also see that the share of papers with both female and male co-authors increases across all
subfields. However, the increase is predominantly concentrated in micro and macro & international.
In finance in 2013-2016, roughly one-third of the papers have a female author on them, while in micro
this share is almost half.

3.3

Across Programs

Next, we plot the distribution of female authorship across individual programs. In order to reduce
the amount of noise in these plots, we focus on programs that exist for at least six years in our sample.
This procedure excludes one-off programs and other programs with shorter durations. A notable
omission is the Development Economics program, which is now a major program but has only been
in existence since 2013.16
In Figure 4, we present the range of female authorship across programs and years using a box plot
of the share of female authorship. The unit of observation is a program-year, and the outcome is the
share of female authors. The box reflects the interquartile range for a given program, from the 25th
to 75th percentile across years. The tails of the box extend to the furthest value within 1.5 standard
deviations of each side of the interquartile range, where the standard deviation is measured within
15 In Figure 4, it is clear that the average share of women for the Finance subfield is pulled up by Entreprenuership.
In unreported results, we reran the time series with Entreprenuership included in Micro instead of Finance. In this case,
Finance stayed almost completely flat, with 13.3 percent women in 2013-2016 (and an identical share of 13.3 percent in
2001-2004, as Entrepreneurship began in 2009).
16 In Appendix Figure A5, we repeat the exercise, but focus on the major NBER programs and include Development
Economics. The results look very similar.

program. We plot finance, macro & international and micro in three different colors, and sort the
programs based on the programs’ median value of female share of authorship. The solid black line
presents the overall average female share, weighted by number of papers.
We see substantial variation both across programs and within programs. In particular, while there
are exceptions to the ordering of gender-representation across the sub-fields, the ordering of finance
followed by macro & international and micro is preserved. There is substantial variation across the
individual programs, with the lowest median share of roughly 10 percent (Impulse & Propagation
Mechanisms) near the bottom and the highest median share with 37 percent (Children).

3.4

Benchmarking the time series

To draw conclusions about the level of female representation at the Summer Institute, it is necessary to
have an appropriate benchmark of overall female representation in economics; i.e., what is the pool of
potential authors for the NBER? This is made difficult for two reasons. First, the composition of faculty
seniority in the NBER Summer Institute programs may not necessarily correspond to the composition
of faculty in departments. Junior faculty may have stronger incentives to write papers and submit to
conferences while working towards tenure, while established senior faculty may find it easier to get
their papers accepted. Second, it is not clear which economics departments are the most appropriate
benchmark for comparison. As the Summer Institute is a prestigious conference, the question arises
whether the Top 10 or 20 departments provide the most relevant benchmark or whether we should
look more broadly. As a result, the mix at the NBER may not be completely representative of the field.
Using the 2016 data, we manually identify the rank and type of institutions of the authors on
accepted papers to provide answers to our questions above. First, in Panel A of Figure 5, we plot the
faculty rank share for both men and women accepted to the NBER Summer Institute, and compare
it to the relative share of each rank using the data from CSWEP. We see that the representation of
assistant professors at the NBER Summer Institute is much higher than at all 126 departments with
doctoral programs, as well as at the Top 20 and Top 10 departments. In fact, the share at the NBER
is nearly double the share of assistant professors at the Top 10 universities. In contrast, there are far
fewer full professors as authors on the NBER Summer Institute programs relative to departments with
doctoral programs.17
The data from CSWEP also provides the share of women at all 126 doctoral departments, as well
17 To

make these datasets comparable, we exclude non-university economists and graduate students in the NBER dataset
when calculating the shares.

9

as at the Top 20 and Top 10 departments.18 . Since the data is provided by faculty seniority, we can also
estimate the relative share of women by rank. Hence, we next compare the share of assistant faculty
and full professors that are women on papers on the NBER schedule to the CSWEP data. In other
words, we examine the fraction of female authors who are assistant professors relative to all university
faculty authors who are assistant professors and featured on the program. In Panel B of Figure 5,
we report these numbers in 2016. In both cases, we see that the NBER Summer Institute shares of
female authors reflect roughly the composition of women at Top 20 institutions, are higher than the
composition at Top 10 departments, and lower than the figure for all 126 doctoral departments. This
suggests that the composition of faculty at the NBER is heavily skewed towards junior faculty, when
compared to the overall academic population, and by rank, the share of women is comparable to the
Top 20 departments.
We now expand our benchmark comparison to the full time series. In Figure 6, we plot the share
of women in tenure-track positions, both in aggregate and for junior & senior positions, in economics
programs at universities with graduate programs. We first see that on average, the overall share of
women in all tenure-track positions grew steadily from 2001, from 12.9 percent to 20.1 percent in 2016.
In contrast, the fraction of assistant professors who are women has stayed relatively constant since
2005, and the fraction of full professors who are women has gradually risen post-2008 after being flat
from 2001-2008.
When compared to the share of female authors at the NBER Summer Institute, the share of women
in all tenure-track positions is consistently lower, although the gap has shrunk over time. In contrast,
the share of women amongst junior faculty is consistently higher than the share of female authors on
the NBER Summer Institute program. It is noteworthy that if we were to assume that the composition of junior and senior faculty stayed the same from 2001 onwards, the share of female authors
at the NBER Summer Institute should have tracked upwards, since the relative share of female full
professors and junior faculty has increased over time.
No single CSWEP comparisons seems highly correlated with the time series of female NBER authorship. Instead, the measure that correlates best with the share of female NBER authors is the stock
of female NBER members. This fact holds true even when we split members across fields in Appendix
Figure A6. This finding is perhaps unsurprising: NBER members are likely most aware of the Summer
18 CSWEP’s historical panel for estimating female representation has changed over time. As a result, they have made
efforts to harmonize the numbers but the results are not perfectly representative. For further discussion, see page 7 of the
2016 CSWEP Annual Report.

Institute, and thus more likely to submit to the conference.

3.5

Submissions

Now, we turn to the pipeline of submissions at the NBER. A potential explanation for the low share of
women at the NBER may be differences in the acceptance rates between male and female-coauthored
submissions. We find that this is not the case.
Using an anonymized dataset of submissions from the 2016 and 2017 NBER Summer Institute, we
are able to identify overall acceptance rates across papers, as well as within each field: finance, macro
& international and micro.19 Figure 7 shows nearly indistinguishable acceptance rates for women
compared to men when the groups are pooled together. For both macro and micro, the differences
are either close to zero, and are statistically indistinguishable from zero (in the case of micro, slightly
weighted towards women). In the case of finance, we see a marginally significant 2 percentage point
difference in acceptance rates (t-stat= -1.63). This difference is relatively small percentage-wise, but
given a low acceptance rate on average, 2 percentage points is non-trivial difference in rates. Moreover,
the difference in acceptance rates in finance appears in both years of the data (see Appendix Figure
A10 for both years split out).
The very similar acceptance rates across other programs suggest that the overall proportion of
women on programs reflects the submission rates by women. One caveat when interpreting these
rates is that papers may be submitted to multiple programs, and typically only get accepted to one.
As a result, the probability that a “unique” paper is accepted to the Summer Institute is likely higher.
However, unless the number of submissions per paper is correlated with author gender, this should
not affect our overall analysis.

3.6

Organizers

We next examine the differences in programs depending on the gender of the organizer. Table 2 reports
the impact of having a female organizer on the share of female authors. This table presents regression
results from alternative versions of the following benchmark specification:

Female Shareit = αi + αt + Female Organizerit + eit ,
19 We

(1)

are extremely grateful to the Jim Poterba and Alex Aminoff for merging gender identifiers to the NBER submissions
data and preparing summary tabulations relating to the 2016 and 2017 meetings for us.

11

where the share of women on a program is the dependent variable, the main explanatory variable
is “Any Female Organizer” in Panel A which is an indicator for whether any of the organizers are
women. In Panel B, we include “Share Female Organizers” which is a continuous measure of the
fraction of women organizers. In all specifications, we weight programs by the number of papers.
Standard errors are clustered at the program level.
In our first specification, we examine the full pooled effect, with only year fixed effects in the
regression, and report the results in Column 1. We find an insignificant positive effect of having a
female organizer on the share of female authors. In Column 2, we also include program fixed effects
along with the year fixed effects. The estimates suggest a positive and significant effect of about 3.5
percentage points of a female organizer on the share of women featured on a program. Since this
regression exploits within-program variation in organizer gender, it highlights the fact that similar
topics with female organizers appear to have a higher representation of women.
A caveat to bear in mind is that the observed patterns may be capturing differential trends across
programs if the growth in female organizers coincides with a growth in the share of women. In other
words, there may be a growing representation of women in a field that drives the increase in both
female organizers and female authorship. Indeed, we see in Figure 8 that the share of programs
with at least one female organizer has grown over time, with a particularly pronounced growth in
micro and macro & international. We attempt to address this concern by controlling for subfield-byyear fixed effects (Finance, Micro and Macro/International by year). The inclusion of field-year fixed
effects reduces the coefficient estimates, but they remain marginally significant and the effect of female
organizers on female-representation on programs is still positive.
In Columns 4-6, we mimic the regressions from Column 1-3, but differentiate the coefficients
by field. We see the positive effect of female organizers concentrated in macro & international, and
surprisingly a negative effect in finance. This result disappears with subfield-by-year fixed effects in
Column 6 for finance, but persists in macro & international.

3.7

Discussants

Finally, we turn to the share of women amongst discussants. Not all programs at the Summer Institute
have discussants – amongst the 48 distinct programs we measure in 2016, for papers that we consider,
only 29 of the programs have discussants. It is interesting to examine the gender representation of
discussants as organizers typically select discussants. For prestigious venues like the NBER, it may be

12

valuable to receive the opportunity to discuss a paper at the NBER, as it enhances a scholar’s visibility
in the field. At the same time, it does not substitute for presenting one’s own work and may reflect
a time-consuming burden. Since organizers select discussants based on the papers chosen and not
the underlying pool of submissions, they likely reflect the organizers’ information set of appropriate
discussants, rather than the pool of submitted papers. As a result, this can be a useful tool for studying
female representation at a conference, independent of submission rates.
In Figure 9, we compare the share of authors and discussants that are female over time. To make a
fair comparison, we examine the subset of programs that have at least one discussant in a given year
(54% of all program-years), and plot the average share of women for authors and discussants similar to
Figure 1. Overall, these programs tend to have a lower share of women as authors. When comparing
authors to discussants, the share of women as discussants is even slightly lower, with a larger gap in
recent years. In Panels B to D, we compare the differences between authors and discussants for each
subfield, and find that the gap is largest in micro. To test for statistical differences in aggregate as well
as across fields, we run the following specification:

Femaleit = αt + Discussantit + eit ,

(2)

where an observation is at the person-paper-year level, Femaleit is an indicator for whether the person
is a woman, and Discussantit is an indicator for whether the person is a discussant. We first pool this
regression for all sessions, and then separately for each of micro, macro & international and finance.
All specifications include year fixed effects and cluster at the session-year level. We report the results
in Table 3. We find that in aggregate and across all fields, the share of women as discussants is lower
than that of authors, but this difference is only statistically significant for micro.
This evidence can be interpreted both positively and negatively. On the plus side, a body of evidence suggests that women bear a larger brunt of the “service” tasks in academia (e.g. Misra et al.
(2011)), and it suggests that this is not the case at the NBER. On the other hand, being a discussant
(particularly at a high-prestige venue such as the NBER summer institute), can be considered an important way to create visibility for young academics, and one in which organizers have substantial
discretion. Being a discussant is both a burden and a benefit – empirically it is unclear whether either
dominates. What is clear is that the scales are slightly tipped against women as discussants.
We lastly examine whether the gender of the organizers plays any role in explaining differences

13

in the share of female discussants on a program. In Table 4, we run the same regression as Table 2,
but now put the female share of discussants as the outcome variable. We see that in Columns 1-3,
there is a positive effect of having a female organizer on the female share of discussants. In Column
2, including year and program fixed effects, there is on average a 3.5 percentage point increase in the
female share of discussants when a female organizer is present. However, this is only significant at
the 10% level. With subfield-year fixed effects, the effects are no longer significant.

Conclusion

Our research provides a link to broader research on female visibility at conferences in STEM fields.20
Studies in STEM have shown evidence of low representation of female scientists as speakers at major
conferences, despite an increasing share of women in these fields, (Kalejta and Palmenberg, 2017;
Casadevall and Handelsman, 2014; Casadevall, 2015).21 Although economics often receives STEM
designation due to its quantitative content, there is little evidence about the gender composition of
economics conference programs. In this paper, we fill that gap using sixteen years of conference
programs from the National Bureau of Economic Research’s (NBER) Summer Institute to estimate the
representation of female economists at the conference across time and subfields.
We find that over the period from 2013-2016, women made up 20.6% of all authors on scheduled papers, but there was large dispersion across different sub-disciplines, with the share of female
economists ranging from 7.3% to 47.7% over the programs. While the average share of women on
programs has risen slightly over the past 16 years from 18.5% in 2001-2004, the gap of women between finance, macroeconomics and microeconomics subfields has remained constant, with women
currently making up 14.4% of authors in finance, 16.3% of authors in macro & international, and 25.9%
of authors in microeconomics.
Using two years of anonymized submission data, we find statistically indistinguishable acceptance rates across men and women. Hence, the gender representation at the NBER Summer Institute
likely reflects the gender composition of the submissions pool. However, it is difficult to ascertain the
pool of academics who submit to the NBER summer institute. From our analysis, the only comparable
benchmark of female economists that matches both the level and time series of female representation
20 STEM refers to the academic disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

at the NBER is the share of women who are NBER affiliates. While the NBER Summer Institute makes
a substantial effort to email and contact all departments with doctoral programs to solicit submissions,
our results suggest that either information or some other barriers may influence the probability of submission. For programs interested in increasing female representation, encouraging a larger share of
female submissions may be effective.
We are also left with the puzzling question of why there are such stark differences across fields in
female representation. Indeed, far from being homogeneous, we find that for an economist attending
the first week of the Summer Institute in 2016 (dominated by finance and macroeconomics sessions),
17.5 percent of the authors on papers presented were women. In contrast, the third week of papers
(a week focused on labor and public economics) had almost twice as many women on the program;
30.5 percent of the authors were women. While finance acceptance rates appear to have a small tilt in
favor of men, this is not the case for macro & international, which also have much lower representation of women. A potential explanation is that women have a preference for topics in certain subfields
of economics and actively choose to enter these fields. Given evidence on the role of mentoring (e.g.
Neumark and Gardecki (1998), Carrell, Page and West (2010), Bettinger and Long (2005)), future research could consider the impact of mentors on encouraging more women to enter particular subfields
of economics. Alternatively, there may be unexplored barriers to entry in sub-fields in finance. These
barriers appear puzzling and worth exploring in future research.

Note: This table presents results from the following specification:
Femaleit = αt + Discussantit + eit ,

(4)

where an observation is at the person-paper-year level. Femaleit is an indicator for whether the person is
a woman, and Discussantit is an indicator for whether the person is a discussant. Column 1 pools for all
sessions together, and then Column 2-4 reports regressions seperately for each of Micro, Macro/International
and Finance. Programs are coded into fields using the categorization in Table 1. All specifications include year
fixed effects and cluster at the session-year level. * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01

Note: This table presents regression results from versions of the following specification:
Female Shareit = αi + αt + Female Organizerit + eit ,

(5)

where the female share of discussants on a program is the dependent variable, the main explanatory variable
is Any Female Organizer, an indicator for whether any of the organizers are women. The unit of analysis is
a program-year. In Column 1, we report the coefficients using just year fixed effects. In Column 2, we add
program fixed effects. In Column 3, we add field-year fixed effects to the specification from column 2. In
Columns 4-6, we mimic the regressions from Column 1-3, but split out the coefficients by field. Programs are
coded into fields using the categorization in Table 1. Standard errors are clustered at the program level, and
regressions are weighted by the number of papers on a program in a given year. * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01

Note: This figure plots the share of female economist in different categories over time. The dashed lines reflect
the share of NBER membership (research associates and faulty research fellows) that are women, within each
field. This comes from the NBER website on NBER members. The solid reflect the share of authorship that is
female at each NBER summer institute. Programs are coded into fields using the categorization in Table 1.
