ABSTRACT
This paper provides estimates of the effects of in utero exposure to contaminated drinking water on
fetal health. We examine the universe of birth records and drinking water testing results for the state
of New Jersey from 1997 to 2007. Our data enable us to compare outcomes across siblings who were
potentially exposed to differing levels of harmful contaminants from drinking water while in utero.
We find small effects of drinking water contamination on all children, but large and statistically significant
effects on birth weight and gestation of infants born to less educated mothers. We also show that those
mothers who were most affected by contaminants were the least likely to move between births in response
to contamination.

Health at birth is predictive of important child outcomes including educational attainment and
adult earnings. Hence, economists are increasingly concerned with understanding the impacts of
conditions during pregnancy on birth outcomes (Almond and Currie, 2010, 2011; Black et al.
2007; Case and Paxson, 2008; Currie, 2011). Exposure to environmental pollution during
pregnancy is a common source of potential fetal health shocks. Recent research shows that, even
at levels below current air quality standards, air pollution can harm fetal health as measured by
the incidence of low birth weight and prematurity (Currie and Neidell, 2005; Currie, Neidell, and
Schmeider, 2009). Drinking water contamination is another, potentially important, source of in
utero exposure to pollution. A recent series of articles in The New York Times (c.f. Duhigg,
2009) have highlighted lapses in drinking water quality throughout the U.S., suggesting that
contamination of drinking water may be relatively common.
This paper provides estimates of the effects of in utero exposure to contaminated drinking
water on fetal health. To do this, we examine the universe of birth records and drinking water
testing results for the state of New Jersey from 1997 to 2007. Our data enable us to compare
outcomes across siblings who were potentially exposed to differing levels of harmful
contaminants from drinking water while in utero. We find small effects of drinking water
contamination on all children, but large and statistically significant effects on birth weight and
gestation of infants born to less educated mothers. We also show that those mothers who were
most affected by contamination were the least likely to move between births in response to
contamination.
Our paper highlights several methodological issues relevant to the study of a broad range
of fetal and infant health effects. First, women who are exposed to pollutants differ in
observable ways from those who are not, and may also differ in unobservable ways. These

differences must be accounted for, or they will bias the estimated effects of potential exposure.
Second, mothers can take action to protect themselves and their children from harmful
exposures, such as moving away from pollution sources. Our results are consistent with
previous literature which suggests that the more educated are more likely to take these protective
actions (Graff Zivin, Neidell, and Schlenker, 2011; Currie, 2011). Third, babies with longer
gestation have a longer window in which they could have been exposed to a harmful
contaminant. Since, other things being equal, babies with longer gestations have better
outcomes, estimation methods that do not take account of the longer exposure window are biased
against finding an effect. Since we follow mothers over time, we explicitly examine moving and
use mother fixed effects in order to deal with omitted variables bias,1 and use an instrumental
variable constructed assuming gestation of nine months to deal with the mechanical correlation
between gestation length and exposures.
The paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides a review of related literature;
Section 3 discusses the data; Section 4 discusses the empirical framework; Section 5 presents the
results; and Section 6 concludes.

2. Background Literature
b) The Impact of Air Pollution of Infant Health

Much of the growing literature about pollution and health has focused on the impact of air
pollution on fetal health. The reason for examining fetal health is that, unlike adults, fetuses
have a relatively short window in which they could be exposed to pollutants, so one can more

1

Note that this strategy does not account for changes in water consumption patterns in response to water quality
violations (Graff Zivin, Neidell, and Schlenker, 2011). This does not introduce a bias per se but changes the
interpretation of estimates, so that our estimates reflect the effect of contamination net of avoidance behavior. See
Graff Zivin and Neidell (2013) for more details.

confidently draw a connection between a contemporaneous pollution source and an adverse
health outcome. In contrast, adults have been exposed to many pollutants over the course of a
lifetime, and it may be difficult to connect current health problems with recent exposures. The
reason for focusing on air pollution is that most developed countries have established systems of
air quality monitoring stations, so that pollution data is readily available.
Cross-sectional differences in ambient air pollution have been shown to be correlated
with other determinants of fetal health. In particular, fetuses exposed to higher levels of air
pollution are more likely to be African-American or Hispanic and tend to have less educated
mothers (Currie, 2011). Failing to account for these relationships leads to upwardly biased
estimates of the effects of pollution. Epidemiological studies typically have few (if any) controls
for these potential confounders.2
Chay and Greenstone (2003a, 2003b) address the problem of omitted variables by
focusing on "natural experiments" provided by the implementation of the Clean Air Act of 1970
and the recession of the early 1980s. Both the Clean Air Act and the recession induced sharper
reductions in air-borne particulates in some counties than in others, and they use this exogenous
variation in levels of air pollution at the county-year level to identify its effects. They estimate
that a one unit decline in particulates caused by the implementation of the Clean Air Act (or
recession) led to between five and eight (four and seven) fewer infant deaths per 100,000 live
births. They also find some evidence that the decline in Total Suspended Particles (TSPs) led to
reductions in the incidence of low birth weight. However, only TSPs were measured at that time,
so that they could not study the effects of other pollutants. And the levels of particulates studied

2

There are some important exceptions. For example, Parker et al. (2008) study a natural
experiment caused by the closure and reopening of a steel mill in a valley in Utah, and find that
the closure reduced preterm birth.

by Chay and Greenstone (2003a, 2003b) are much higher than those prevalent today; for
example, PM10 (particulate matter of 10 microns or less) levels have fallen by nearly 50 percent
from 1980 to 2000.
Several recent studies consider natural experiments at more recently-encountered
pollution levels. For example, Currie, Neidell, and Schmieder (2009) focus on a sample of
mothers who lived near pollution monitors, and showed that babies exposed to higher levels of
carbon monoxide (CO) in utero (which comes largely from vehicle exhaust) suffered reduced
birth weight and gestation length relative to siblings, even though ambient CO levels were
generally much lower than current Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards.3 The
estimates suggest that moving from an area with high levels of CO to one with low levels of CO
would have an effect larger than getting a woman who was smoking ten cigarettes a day during
pregnancy to quit.4 Moreover, CO exposure increases the risk of death among newborns by 2.5
percent. The negative effects of CO exposure are five times greater for smokers than for nonsmokers, and there is some evidence of negative effects of exposure to ozone and particulates
among infants of smokers. Coneus and Spiess (2012) adopt similar methods using German data,
and also find large effects of CO on infant health.
Currie and Walker (2011) exploit the introduction of electronic toll collection devices (EZPass) in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Since much of the pollution produced by automobiles
occurs when idling or accelerating back to highway speed, electronic toll collection greatly

This study builds on an earlier paper by Currie and Neidell (2005) that imputed pollution levels
at the zip code level.

The standard for eight hour CO concentrations is nine parts per million (ppm). The mean in
our sample is 1.6ppm, but some areas had levels around four. Moving from an area with 4ppm
to one with 1ppm in the third trimester would reduce low birth weight by 2.5 percentage points,
while going from ten to zero cigarettes per day would reduce the incidence of low birth weight
by 1.8 percentage points.

reduces auto emissions in the vicinity of a toll plaza. They compare mothers near toll plazas to
those who live near busy roadways but further from toll plazas and find that E-ZPass increases
birth weight and gestation. They obtain similar estimates when they follow mothers over time
and compare siblings born before and after adoption of E-ZPass. E-ZPass reduced CO by about
40 percent in the vicinity of toll plazas, and also reduced concentrations of many other pollutants
found in vehicle exhaust. These reductions reduce the incidence of low birth weight by about
one percentage point in the two kilometers surrounding the toll plaza, and by as much as 2.25
percentage points in areas immediately adjacent to the toll plaza.5
b) Evidence Regarding the Impact of Water Pollution
Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) in 1974 to safeguard public
health by enabling the federal regulation of the national drinking water supply. This Act requires
that the Environmental Protection Agency set health-based standards for common contaminants
and oversee the enforcement of these standards. Amended in 1986 and 1996 to strengthen and
extend the original rules, SDWA remains the major federal law concerning the nation’s drinking
water.
The SDWA applies to all of the more than 160,000 public water systems in the United
States. These systems provide water to almost all Americans at some time in their lives.6 Water
for public water systems is drawn from underground wells or surface water sources, including
rivers and lakes, and passes through treatment facilities before reaching distribution systems.

5

In contrast to the results reported below, they did not find any impact of E-ZPass adoption on
the demographic composition of births in the immediate vicinity of the toll plazas in the three
years before and after adoption. It is possible that mothers did not realize the health benefits
associated with adoption.
6
These regulations do not apply to private wells or bottled water. For more information, see:
http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/sdwa/basicinformation.cfm.

Under the guidelines set forth by the SDWA, testing for contamination is performed by a
third party. Maximum Contaminant Limits (MCL) are set as the stricter of state and federal
requirements and concentrations over these limits incur violations. Testing guidelines, including
frequency, location, and follow up actions, are determined by contaminant type, the size of the
population served and other parameters.7
Compared to air pollution, there has been relatively little investigation of the health
effects of water pollution in rich countries such as the United States. Unlike air pollution, data
on water pollution are more difficult to obtain and less conducive to estimating health effects.
For example, although water quality is continuously monitored at all public water systems, the
only reported data is when violations occur, and it is only accessible on a large scale basis by
filing a Freedom of Information Act.
There are a number of threats to drinking water in the U.S., including improper disposal
of chemicals, animal and human wastes, pesticides, and naturally occurring substances such as
radon and arsenic that make understanding the impacts of water quality important for policy.
While these substances are indeed routinely monitored, it appears that there are many violations
of Safe Drinking Water Act standards. According to Duhigg (2009), 20% of U.S. water
treatment systems had violated provisions of the act over the past five years. While many of
these violations involved failure to report test water or to report test results accurately, there are
also many water systems with illegal concentrations of chemicals such as arsenic and radioactive
elements.

7

An explanation of the complex testing rules by contaminant type is beyond the scope of this
article. For more information, see: www.nj.gov/dep/watersupply/dws_monitor.html.

This paper provides the first quasi-experimental examination of the effects of water
pollution on infant health.
c) The Importance of Avoidance Behavior
Another issue that affects the measurement of the effects of pollution is avoidance
behavior. People take actions ranging from changes in daily activities to moving house in order
to reduce exposures to harmful pollutants. If people act to minimize their exposure, then the
potentially harmful effects of pollution may be understated by estimation procedures that do not
take these actions into account. A growing body of evidence suggests changes in daily actions
effectively reduce exposure to pollution, whether from poor levels of air quality (Neidell, 2009)
or mercury levels in fish (Shimshack et al., 2007).
Most relevant to this study, Graff Zivin, Neidell, and Schlenker (2011) find that drinking
water violations reduce the consumption of bottled water using purchase data from a national
grocery chain. They find that violations increase bottled water consumption by 17 to 22 percent,
depending on the contaminant responsible for the violation. They also find that wealthier
households are more likely to respond to chemical violations. While we are unable to control for
this and other contemporaneous avoidance behaviors, we will exploit this heterogeneity to
investigate whether the effects of contamination are higher in children from lower SES families.
With respect to mobility, Banzhaf and Walsh (2008), using California data from the
decennial Census, find that high income families tend to move away from highly polluted areas.
Currie (2011) and Currie and Walker (2011) use continuous Vital Statistics Natality data to look
specifically at the responses of pregnant women to either changes in local pollution levels, or to
changes in information about pollution levels. For example, Currie (2011) shows that following
the announcement that a Superfund site has been cleaned up, the share of white, college-educated

mothers living in the area immediately surrounding the site increases while the share of AfricanAmerican, high school dropout mothers declines. Conversely, when new information is released
about hazardous emissions of heavy metals at an industrial plant, the area immediately
surrounding the plant becomes less “white” and less college-educated. These analyses suggest
that pregnant mothers can respond relatively rapidly to perceived changes in environmental
threats, but that it is primarily white college-educated women who do so. Since we follow
mothers over time, we can explore whether water quality affects their decision to move.

3. Data and Summary Statistics
Our analysis relies on four sources of data: New Jersey vital statistics natality records
(birth certificates) for the years 1997 to 2007, records of drinking water violations for New
Jersey from 1997 to 2007, temperature and precipitation statistics, and a map of drinking water
service areas in New Jersey. As described in the next section, precise information on the
mother’s location of residence from the birth certificates enables us to match these datasets
together.
Our first data source is birth certificate data obtained from the Vital Statistics Division of
the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services. These data include a record for every
birth and each record has information about the infant’s health at birth including birth weight and
gestational age as well as maternal characteristics such as race, education, and marital status. We
were able to obtain a confidential version of the data which included the longitude and latitude of
the mother’s residence. Siblings were also matched to each other in the birth sample using
mother’s full maiden name, race and birth date, father’s information, and social security numbers

where available.8
The second data sources contains data on testing requirements, reporting requirements,
and water quality from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJ DEP),
which collects records of violations of drinking water MCLs. In this study, we use data on
violations of MCLs only. There are many other violations which have to do with reporting
requirements. The violations data include the start and end date of the testing period during
which the violation was recorded, the contaminant name, testing site, name of the water system,
and characteristics of the water system, including the size of the population served.9 We omit
these since it is unclear whether these violations pose a health threat.
We divided contaminants that posed a potential threat to human health into two
categories. The first category, which we label “any chemical contaminant,” includes: 1,2dichloroethane; antimony; arsenic; barium; benzene; beryllium; cadmium; carbon tetrachloride;
dichloromethane; gross alpha, including radon and uranium; gross alpha, excluding radon and
uranium; haloacetic acids (haa5); iron; lead and copper rule violations; manganese; mercury;
nitrate; selenium; styrene; tthm; tetrachloroethylene; thallium; trichloroethylene; combined
radium (-226 & -228); and combined uranium. The second category, which we label “any
8

This matching was done on site in Trenton, and then all identifiers were stripped from the data.
Given that we have a fixed time window, there are siblings we cannot find because the sibling
was born either before the start of our window or after the end of our window. One way to
assess the accuracy of our matching algorithm is to look for second and higher birth-order
children where the “date of last live birth” is in our time window, and see if we can find these
births. We would not expect to find all of them since some women will have moved from other
states between births. For this group of children we are able to find 79% of previous births,
giving us some confidence in our matching algorithm.
9
We also focus our sample on community water systems. Community water systems pipe water
for human consumption to at least 15 service connections used year-round, or one that regularly
serves at least 25 year-round residents. Other types of water systems include transient noncommunity and non-transient, non-community. These other types of water systems supply water
to people for short periods of time and include gas station, campgrounds, schools, office
buildings, and hospitals.

contaminant,” is broader and includes bacterial contaminants due to coliform from fecal matter
and other sources in addition to all contamination in our first “any chemical contaminant”
category.
The third data source is a digitized map of the community water service areas from the
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) (Carter et al., 2004).10 This map
was originally created to enable long-term water supply planning, and to aid in emergency
management during drought. The map, reproduced as Figure 1, contains the coordinates of the
boundaries of all community service areas, which change little over time.
Our subsample of all community water districts for 1997-2007 which have non-missing
geographic information includes 488 systems. The smallest serves 22 people (Triple Brook
Mobile Home Park), while the largest serves 773,163 (Hackensack Water Company, which
serves several towns in Northeastern NJ). The mean number of people served per water district
is 19,011, while the median is 4,012.
Of this sample, 135 water districts have MCL violations during our time period. The
smallest district with a violation serves 40 people, while the largest serves 314,900. The mean
number served in the subsample with violations is 30,062.
The final source of data is daily temperature statistics for each 2.5 by 2.5 mile square in
the state of New Jersey. Construction of this data follows Schlenker and Roberts (2006). Using
this data, we construct, for each square: the average and absolute maximum and minimum daily
temperature; the percentage of days with temperature below 0 C and above 29.4 C; and the
percentage of days with precipitation and average daily precipitation. This data will help us

control for fluctuations in weather that might affect exposure as well as infant health; for
example, when it is hotter, people may drink more tap water, but heat is also related to birth
weight (Deschenes et al, 2009).
As discussed above, the birth data include the longitude and latitude of the mother’s
residence. Combining this data with the NJ DEP drinking water map using ArcGIS software,11
we are able to match births to the water systems that serve their residences. Births that do not
match to our map are dropped from our sample as these residences utilize private wells and we
have no information about their water quality.
We then merge the violation history of each water system into our matched data. We
create two types of indicators. The first pair measures whether there were chemical or any
violations that occurred during the child’s actual gestation period, and the second measures
whether there were chemical or any violations during the 39 weeks following each infant’s
conception. The exposure variables based on a fixed gestation length of 39 weeks will be used
as instrumental variables for the actual exposure measures in order to correct for the mechanical
correlation between gestation length and the probability of exposure described above.
We match the weather data to each birth by the location of the mother’s residence. To do
this, we calculate the centroid of each 2.5 by 2.5 mile square and assign each mother to her
closest centroid. Then, we calculate averages of the daily weather statistics in the given centroid
over each mother’s gestational period.
Of the original sample of 1,283,598, 1,044,355 could be matched to a water district.
Those outside water districts rely on wells, which are not systematically tested. Deleting “one

child” families resulted in 529,565 observations. Finally, we deleted observations with missing
data on birth weight and gestation, as well as their siblings which left 521,978 observations.
Table 1 provides summary statistics for the control variables used in our analysis. The
first row shows that 8% of infants were potentially exposed to drinking water contamination due
to violations of MCLs in utero. Of these, 84% were exposed to chemical violations. The most
common chemical violations are from combined radium, TTHM, and gross alpha, each of which
make up roughly 20% of the chemical violations. The most common sources of chemical
exposure during the in-utero period are TTHM, haloacetic acids, and coliform, affecting 2.95%,
1.46%, and 1.43% of births, respectively.
Table 1 also shows the same statistics for those potentially exposed to violations. Infants
exposed to any contamination are more likely to be low birth weight (birth weight less than
2,500 grams) and/or preterm (gestation less than 37 weeks) than the average infant, and that
infants exposed to chemical contamination of drinking water in utero are particularly likely to
have one of these negative outcomes. However, the rest of the table suggests that these
relationships may not be causal: Infants exposed to contamination in utero tend to have mothers
who are younger, less educated, and less likely to be married than other mothers. They are also
much more likely to be African-American or Hispanic than the average mother in New Jersey.
All of these factors except Hispanic ethnicity are independently associated with poorer birth
outcomes. It will be important to control for these and other potential differences in our
estimation.

4. Empirical Methods

Table 1 shows that there are observable differences between pregnant women who live in water
districts with violations, and those who do not. We will estimate models with mother fixed
effects in order to control for all factors, observed and unobserved, that are constant between
mothers. These models take the form:

Outcomeiwmt = β0+β1*CNTMiwmt+θ’Xiwmt+η’TEMPiwmt+αm+γt+εiwmt

(1)

for each infant i, born in year-month t, in water system w, to mother m. The outcomes we
consider include low birth weight and prematurity. CNTMiwmt is an indicator of contamination—
either “any chemical contamination” or “any contamination.” Xiwmt is the following vector of
indicators: mother's age: 19-24, 25-34, 35+, missing; mother's race: non-Hispanic White, nonHispanic black, Hispanic, missing race; mother's education: less than high school, some college,
college or more, education missing; risk factors for the pregnancy; maternal smoking; parity
indicators; mother is married, marital information is missing; child is male, sex of child is
missing. TEMPiwmt is a vector of weather controls including: maximum daily temp; minimum
daily temp; percent of days in which the daily maximum is above 29.4 C; percent of days in
which daily minimum is below 0 C; average daily precipitation; percent of days in which
precipitation is over 0.) The αm are a vector of mother fixed effects, while the γt are a vector of
year*month of birth effects. The key coefficient is β1, which measures the effects of exposure to
drinking water contamination on the outcome of interest.
While mother fixed effects control for all fixed characteristics of mothers, location is not
necessarily a constant, because women may move in response to contamination in their water
districts. If contaminants exceed maximum contaminant level (MCL) standards, the purveyor of

the local drinking water system must notify the NJ DEP of the violation and notify customers
within 24-hours if the contaminant poses an immediate health threat (which primarily involves
microorganisms and nitrates) and within 30 days for other health threats.
If a mother moves because of contamination, revealed preference arguments suggest that
she preferred her first location to the available options in the absence of contamination. Suppose
a mother experiences drinking water contamination in pregnancy 1, and moves to a new location
where she does not experience contamination.

In this situation, the estimated effect of

experiencing contamination during pregnancy 1 will be biased towards zero because the outcome
of pregnancy 1 will be compared to the outcome of pregnancy 2, in which the woman did not
experience a contamination but was residing in a suboptimal location.
In order to gauge the extent to which our estimates may be biased by endogenous
maternal mobility, we estimate a series of models of the probability that a woman who was
exposed to contamination during one pregnancy has moved by the time she has a subsequent
pregnancy.12 These models take the following form:

Moved2wmt = β0+β1*CNTM1wmt+θ’X1wmt+η’TEMP1wmt+γt+εiwmt

(2)

where Moved refers to whether the mother had moved to a different water system by the time of
the second birth. The other variables are defined in the same way as above, but are measured as
of the time of the first birth.

Given prior literature suggesting differential responses by mothers

with different characteristics, we also estimate models that include interactions of the variable

12

Note that the first birth observed in the data may not be the mother’s first born child. This is
why it is still necessary to control for parity.

CNTM with maternal characteristics including education, race, ethnicity, age, and whether there
are risk factors for the pregnancy.
Finally, to account for the potential endogeneity of gestation, we estimate models
instrumenting CNTM using a “full term gestation” instrument that measures whether the fetus
would have been exposed to contamination had the pregnancy lasted the full term.

5. Results
Table 2 shows estimates of our models of maternal mobility. The first panel shows
estimates using the “any chemical” measure, while the second panel shows estimates using the
“any contaminants” measure. The first column suggests that there is only weak evidence overall
that mothers who are exposed to contaminated drinking water during the first pregnancy are
likely to have moved by the time of the next birth. The coefficient on “any chemicals” is not
statistically significant, while the coefficient on “any contaminant” is significant at the 90% level
of confidence.
However, the remaining columns of Table 2 suggest that this overall result may mask
heterogeneity in the responses across mothers. When we allow the response to vary with
maternal characteristics, the results suggest that mothers who are less educated are less likely
than other mothers to move in response to contamination, while older mothers are more likely to
move. There is also suggestive evidence that black and Hispanic mothers are less likely to move
though these interactions are not statistically significant. These estimates suggest that we
should expect to see larger estimated health effects for minority and less educated women
because these women are less likely to take measures to avoid pollution, including moving.

Table 3 shows our main results for the estimated effects of exposure to contaminated
drinking water on low birth weight and prematurity. The table is arranged to show the effects of
changes in specification on our estimates. Column (1) shows that in an Ordinary Least Squares
regression without mother fixed effects, and without any correction for the mechanical
correlation between gestation length and exposure, exposure to contaminated drinking water
appears to have little effect on birth outcomes. Column (2) shows, however, that when we
instrument actual contamination using the contamination that would have been experienced had
gestation lasted exactly 39 weeks, the estimated effect rises by an order of magnitude, though it
is still imprecisely estimated. The first stage regressions corresponding to Table 3 are shown in
Appendix Table 1. Column (3) demonstrates that controlling for omitted characteristics of the
mother by including mother fixed effects increases the size of the estimated effect.
Finally, column (4) shows the estimated effect when we make both these corrections.
There is now a statistically significant effect of contamination on the incidence of low birth
weight. Both the first and the second panel suggest that the incidence of low birth weight rises
by 0.0032 for exposure to any contaminant and 0.0034 for exposure to a chemical contaminant,
an increase of 6% relative to the mean incidence of low birth weight in the full sample.
Columns (5) through (8) show the results of estimating the same types of models for
prematurity. Column (5) shows that the naïve OLS estimate is actually negative, suggesting that
exposure to contaminated drinking water reduces prematurity. Columns (6) and (7) demonstrate
that either using the instrumental variables strategy or including mother fixed effects reduces the
estimate to statistical insignificance. Finally, column (8) shows that when we adopt both of these
corrections, the estimated effect is positive, though still imprecisely estimated.
As discussed above, it is likely that we will find larger effects in subsets of the population

who are less likely to take measures to avoid contaminated drinking water. This hypothesis is
tested in Table 4, which shows interactions of the contamination variable with the same maternal
characteristics explored in Table 2, using the IV-FE model.13 The main effect of contamination
is generally positive, suggesting that contaminated drinking water increases low birth weight as
in Table 3. The interaction terms are only statistically significant for mothers with high school
or less (though they are also large in magnitude for black mothers), indicating that it is the less
educated who are most likely to suffer negative health effects. The point estimate of 0.0098 on
any chemical contamination represents a large percentage increase over the baseline incidence of
low birth weight in the less educated mothers in our sample: 14.55% on a baseline of .0673.
This point estimate is slightly greater than that on “any contamination” suggesting that chemicals
in the water have more harmful effects than exposure to fecal coliform.
Table 5 shows the same exercise for prematurity. The main effects do not suggest any
overall effect. The interactions again indicate strong negative effects on less educated mothers,
and in this specification we also see effects for black mothers.

6. Conclusions
Mounting evidence links harms suffered in utero to outcomes later in life. Economists
have begun to see the fetal period as one that shapes the trajectory of one’s schooling, earnings,
and health. Special attention should therefore be paid to harmful substances to which pregnant
women might be exposed. While a good deal of recent research focuses on the effects of air
pollution on fetal health, there has been little attention to the potential harm caused by
contaminated drinking water.
13

Larger effects may also exist for these subsets of the population because of poorer maternal
health that is more susceptible to the effects of contamination.

This paper provides a first quasi-experimental investigation of the effects of
contaminated drinking water on fetal health, and highlights several methodological issues that
bedevil the measurement of these effects. First, we show that the women who live in areas with
contaminated water supplies differ from other women in ways that one would expect to be
correlated with worse fetal health. It is therefore important to control for these differences.
Second, women may respond to contaminated water by moving elsewhere. We show that more
educated women are more likely to vote with the feet. Third, there is a mechanical positive
correlation between length of gestation and the probability of being exposed to most fetal health
insults. We show that correcting for this bias can have an important impact on the estimated
magnitude of the effect. Fourth, there is good reason to expect effects to differ by
socioeconomic status. Just as they are more likely to move, more educated women are more
likely to take measures to protect themselves and their children from contaminated water.
We find that living in a water district with contaminated water during pregnancy is
associated with an increase in low birth weight of 14.55% among less educated mothers.
Similarly, potential exposure to contaminated water increases the incidence of prematurity by
10.3% among less educated mothers. Since not every mother in an affected water district is
likely to be exposed to contaminated water, these estimates suggest large negative effects among
those women who are actually exposed to water contaminated by chemicals during pregnancy.

Notes: The sample consists of women who had two births in New Jersey between 1997-2007.
The dependent variable is an indicator equal to 1 if the mother moved between the first and second
births in the sample. The key independent variable is contamination during the first pregnancy. Exposure to
contaminants during pregnancy is instrumented with potential exposure during the 39 weeks following conception. All regressions
include year*month fixed effects and the following indicators measured at first birth: Mother's age (19-24, 25-34, 35+, missing);
mother's race: (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, missing); mother's education (<12, 12, some college, college+, m
mother smoked; risk factors for the pregnancy parity; mother married, married missing, child male, weather controls.
Robust standard errors are clustered on the water system.
