ABSTRACT
DSGE models are characterized by the presence of expectations as explanatory variables. To use these
models for policy evaluation, the econometrician must estimate the parameters of expectation terms.
Standard estimation methods have several drawbacks, including possible lack or weakness of identification
of the parameters, misspecification of the model due to omitted variables or parameter instability,
and the common use of inefficient estimation methods. Several authors have raised concerns over
the implications of using inappropriate instruments to achieve identification. In this paper we analyze
the practical relevance of these problems and we propose to combine factor analysis for information
extraction from large data sets and GMM to estimate the parameters of systems of forward looking
equations. Using these techniques, we evaluate the robustness of recent findings on the importance
of forward looking components in the equations of a standard New-Keynesian model.

Introduction

This paper is about the estimation of New-Keynesian models of the monetary
transmission mechanism. We evaluate a number of recent findings obtained
using single equation methods and we develop a system approach that makes
use of additional identifying information extracted using factor analysis from
large data sets. The combination of factor analysis and GMM to estimate
the parameters of systems of forward looking equations is one of the distinctive features of our work, which extends the univariate analysis in Favero,
Marcellino and Neglia (2005). The latter paper has also stimulated theoretical research on the properties of the factor-GMM estimators, see Bai and
Ng (2006b) and Kapetanios and Marcellino (2006b), which provide a sound
theoretical framework for our empirical analysis.
Following the influential work of Galí and Gertler (1999, GG), a number
of authors have used instrumental variable methods to estimate one or more
equations of the New-Keynesian model of the monetary transmission mechanism. GG used the New-Keynesian paradigm to explain the behavior of
U.S. inflation as a function of its first lag, expected first lead, and the marginal cost of production. Their work stimulated considerable debate, much
of which has focused on the size and significance of future expected inflation
in the New-Keynesian Phillips curve. Similar arguments have been made
over the role of expected future variables in the other equations of the NewKeynesian model: for example Clarida, Galí and Gertler (1998) estimate a
Taylor rule in which expected future inflation appears as a regressor and
Fuhrer and Rudebusch (2002) have estimated an Euler equation for output
in which expected future output appears on the right-hand-side.
The estimation of models that include future expectations has revived
a debate that began in the 1970’s with the advent of rational expectations
econometrics. In this context, a number of authors have raised economet3

ric issues that relate to the specification and estimation of single equations
with forward looking variables. For example, Rudd and Whelan (2005, RW)
showed that the GG parameter estimates for the coeﬃcient on future inflation
may be biased upward if the equation is mis-specified due to the omission of
relevant regressors that are instead used as instruments. With regard to the
estimation of the coeﬃcients of future variables they pointed out that this
problem can yield diﬀerences between estimates that are based on the following two alternative estimation methods. The first (direct) method estimates
the coeﬃcient directly using GMM; the second (indirect) method computes
a partial solution to the complete model that removes the expected future
variable from the right-hand-side and substitutes an infinite distributed lag
of all future expected forcing variables. RW use their analysis to argue in
favor of Phillips curve specifications that favor backward lags of inflation over
the New-Keynesian specification that includes only expected future inflation
as a regressor.
Galí, Gertler and Lopez-Salido (2005, GGLS) have responded to the RW
critique by pointing out that, in spite of the theoretical possibility of omitted
variable bias, estimates obtained by direct and indirect methods are fairly
close, and when additional lags of inflation are added as regressors in the
structural model to proxy for omitted variables, they are not significant.
While the Rudd-Whelan argument is convincing, the CGLS response is less
so since other (contemporaneous) variables might also be incorrectly omitted
from the simple GG inflation equation. Even if additional lags of inflation
were found to be insignificant, their inclusion could change the parameters
of both the closed form solution and the structural model. We argue, in
this paper, that these issues can only be resolved by embedding the single
equation New-Keynesian Phillips curve in a fully specified structural model.
Other authors, e.g. Fuhrer and Rudebusch (2002), Lindé (2005) and Jon-

4

deau and Le Bihan (2003) have pointed out that the Generalized Method of
Moment (GMM) estimation approach followed by GG could be less robust
than maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in the presence of a range of
model mis-specifications such as omitted variables and measurement error,
typically leading to overestimation of the parameter of future expected inflation. GGLS correctly replied that no general theoretical results are available
on the relative merits of GMM and MLE under mis-specification, that the
comparison could be biased by the use of an inappropriate GMM estimator,
and that other authors such as Ireland (2001) provided evidence in favor of
a (pure) forward looking equation for US inflation when using MLE. In this
paper we hope to shed additional light on the eﬃciency and possible bias of
GMM estimation by comparing alternative estimation methods on the same
data set and the same model specification.
A diﬀerent and potentially more problematic critique of the GG approach
comes from Mavroeidis (2005), Bårdsen, Jansen and Nymoen (2003), and Nason and Smith (2005), building upon previous work on rational expectations
by Pesaran (1987). Pesaran (1987) stressed that the conditions for identification of the parameters of the forward looking variables in an equation of
interest should be carefully checked prior to single equation estimation. To
check identification conditions one must specify a model for all of the righthand-side variables. Even if there are enough instruments available such
that conventional order and rank conditions are fulfilled and parameters are
not underidentified there might nevertheless be a problem of weak identification. The articles cited above have shown that in the presence of weak
identification, estimation by GMM yields unreliable results. Weak identification is related to the quality of the instruments when applying GMM. When
instruments are only weakly correlated with the corresponding endogenous
variables they might not be particularly useful for forecasting e.g. future

5

expected inflation. The resulting GMM estimators might then suﬀer from
weak identification, which leads to non-standard distributions for the estimators. As a consequence, this can yield misleading inference, see e.g. Stock,
Wright and Yogo (2002) for a general overview on weak instruments and
weak identification.
In summary, the recent literature on the New-Keynesian Phillips curve
has highlighted four main problems with the single equation approach to
estimation by GMM. First, parameter estimates may be biased due to correlation of the instruments with the error term. Second, an equation of interest
could be mis-specified because of omitted variables or parameter instability
within the sample. Third, parameters of interest may not be identified because there are not enough instruments available. Fourth, parameters may
be weakly identified if the correlation of the instruments with the target
variable is low.
In this paper we analyze the practical relevance of these problems, propose
remedies for each of them, and evaluate whether the findings on the importance of the forward looking component are robust when obtained within a
more general econometric context. In Section 2 we compare single equation
and system methods of estimation for models with forward looking regressors. In Section 3 we conduct a robustness analysis for a full forward looking
system. In Section 4 we analyze the role of information extracted from large
data sets to reduce the risk of specification bias and weak instruments problems. In Section 5 we summarize the main results of the paper and conclude.

Single Equation versus System Approach

We begin this Section with a discussion of the estimation of the New-Keynesian
Phillips curve. This will be followed by a discussion of single-equation esti-

6

mation of the Euler equation and the policy rule. We then contrast the single
equation approach to a closed, three-equation, New-Keynesian model. We estimate simultaneously a complete structural model which combines the three
previously estimated single-equation models for the Phillips curve, the Euler
equation and the policy rule and we compare system estimates of parameters
with those of the three single-equation specifications.
Our starting point is a version of the New-Keynesian Phillips curve inspired by the work of Galí and Gertler (GG 1999),
π t = α0 + α1 πet+1 + α2 xt + α3 π t−1 + et ,

(1)

where π t is the GDP deflator, π et+1 is the forecast of π t+1 made in period
t, xt is a real forcing variable (e.g. marginal costs as suggested by GG,
unemployment - with reference to Okun’s law - as in e.g. Beyer and Farmer
(2007a), or any version of an output gap variable). The error term et is
assumed to be i.i.d. (0, σ 2e ) and is, in general, correlated with the nonpredetermined variables (i.e, with π et+1 and xt ). Since we want to arrive
at the specification of a system of forward looking equations, we prefer to
use as a real forcing variable the output gap1 , measured as the deviation
of real GDP from its one-sided HP filtered version as widely used in the
literature.2
To estimate equation (1) we replace πet+1 with πt+1 , such that (1) becomes
π t = α0 + α1 πt+1 + α2 xt + α3 π t−1 + vt .
1

(2)

The forward looking IS curve is usually specified in terms of the output or unemploy-

ment gap.
2
Notice that although common practice in the applied literature the use of the HP
filtered version of the output gap is by no means unproblematic. For example, Nelson
(2006) finds that the HP cyclical component of U.S. real GDP has no predictive power
for future changes in output growth and Fukac and Pagan (2006) provide an example in
which HP filtering produces biased coeﬃcient estimates within a New-Keynesian model.

7

Equation (2) can be estimated by GMM, with HAC standard errors to take
into account the MA(1) structure of the error term vt = et +α1 (π et+1 −π t+1 ).3
All data is for the US, quarterly, for the period 1970:1-1998:4, where the
constraint on the end date is due to the large data set we use in Section 4.4
In the first panel of the first column of Table 1 we report the singleequation estimation results. As in GG (1999) and Galí et al. (2003), we
find a larger coeﬃcient on π et+1 , about 0.78, than on π t−1 , about 0.23. The
coeﬃcient on the forcing variable is very small and not statistically significant
at the 5% level, again in line with previous results.
There are at least two related problems with this single equation approach: first, the appropriateness or availability of the instruments cannot
be judged in isolation without reference to a more complete model, and therefore, second, the degree of over, just, or under-identification is undefined.
The issue of identification and the use of appropriate instruments in rational expectations models is a very subtle one, see e.g. Pesaran (1987),
Mavroeidis (2005), Bårdsen et al. (2003) or Beyer and Farmer (2003a). In
linear backward looking models, such as conventional simultaneous equation
models, rank and order conditions can be applied in a mechanical way (see
e.g. Fisher, 1966). In rational expectation models, however, the conditions
for identification depend on the solution of the model, i.e. whether the solution of the model is determinate or indeterminate, see Beyer and Farmer
(2007b).
3

In particular, to compute the GMM estimates we start with an identity weighting

matrix, get a first set of coeﬃcients, use these to update the weighting matrix and finally
iterate coeﬃcients to convergence. To compute the HAC standard errors, we adopt the
Newey West (1994) approach with a Bartlett kernel and fixed bandwidth. These calculations are carried out with Eviews 5.0.
4
We have estimated the models using the output gap and unemployment as real forcing
variables. To save space we present here only the output gap results.

8

In our case, as it is common in this literature, we have used (three) lags
of π t , xt and the interest rate, it as instruments where it is the 3-month US
Federal funds interest rate. However, since it does not appear in (1), both
π et+1 and xt may not at all or may only weakly depend on lags of it , which
would make it an irrelevant or a weak instrument. To evaluate whether or
not lagged interest rates are suitable instruments, we estimated the following
sub-VAR model:
xt = b0 + b1 πt−1 + b2 xt−1 + b3 it−1 + uxt ,
it = c0 + c1 π t−1 + c2 xt−1 + c3 it−1 + uct ,

(3)

where uxt and uct are i.i.d. error terms, which are potentially correlated with
et . If b3 = 0, i.e., it does not Granger cause xt , then lags of it are not relevant
instruments for the endogenous variables in (1).
Whether lagged values of inflation and the real variable beyond order
one (i.e., π t−2 , πt−3 , xt−2 and xt−3 ) are relevant instruments for π et+1 is also
questionable. If the solution for π t only depends on πt−1 and xt−1 , which is
the case when the solution is determinate, then the additional lags are not
relevant instruments. However, in case of indeterminacy additional lags of π t
and xt matter, which may re-establish the relevance of π t−2 , π t−3 , xt−2 and
xt−3 as instruments.5
As a consequence of the model dependence with respect to the number
of available and relevant instruments, the Hansen’s J-statistic, a popular
measure for the relevance of the instruments and overidentifying restrictions
that we also present for conformity to the literature, can be potentially un5

Beyer and Farmer (2003a) conduct a systematic search of the parameter space in a

model closely related to the one studied in this paper. They sample from the asymptotic
parameter distribution of the GMM estimates and find, for typical identification schemes,
that point estimates lie in the indeterminate region, but anywhere from 5% to 20% of the
parameter region may lie in the non-existence or determinate region.

9

informative and even misleading when applied in a forward looking context.
Estimating (1) and (3) using only one lag of π, x, and i as instruments,
we find that b3 6= 0 but the null hypothesis b3 = 0 cannot be rejected.
In this case, since the instruments are only weakly correlated with their
targets, the resulting GMM estimators can suﬀer from weak identification,
see Mavroeidis (2005, 2006). This might lead to non-standard distributions
for the estimators and can yield misleading inference, see e.g. Stock, Wright
and Yogo (2002). Empirically, we find that the size of the standard errors
for the estimators of the parameters α1 and α2 in (1) matches the estimated
values for α1 and α2 .
However, when we estimate (1) and (3) using three lags of π, x, and i as
instruments, we find that b3 6= 0 but the null hypothesis b3 = 0 is strongly
rejected. The estimated parameters for (1) are reported in the first panel
in column 2 of Table 1. Compared with the corresponding single equation
estimates we find that the point estimates of the parameters are basically
unaﬀected (there is a non-significant decrease of about 5% in the coeﬃcient of
π et+1 and a corresponding increase in that of π t−1 ). Yet, there is a substantial
reduction in the standard errors of 30-40%. Similar results are obtained when
(3) is substituted for a VAR(3) specification. These findings suggest that the
model is identified, but the solution could be indeterminate. Intuitively,
indeterminacy arises because the sum of the estimated parameters α1 and α3
in (1) is very close to one.
So far the processes for the forcing variables was assumed to be purely
backward looking. As an alternative we consider a forward looking model
also for xt . For example, Fuhrer and Rudebusch (2002) estimated a model
for a representative agent’s Euler equation (in their notation)
xt = β 0 +

β ∗1 xet+1

+

β ∗2 (
k

k−1
X
(iet+j − π et+j+1 )) + β ∗3 xt−1 + β ∗4 xt−2 + η t ,
j=0

10

(4)

where xt is real output (detrended in a variety of ways), xet+1 is the forecast
of xt+1 made in period t, it − π et+1 is a proxy for the real interest rate at time

t, and η t is an i.i.d. (0, σ 2η ) error term. In our sample period, the second lag
of x is not significant and only the current interest rate matters. Hence, the
model becomes
xt = β 0 + β 1 xet+1 + β 2 (it − π et+1 ) + β 3 xt−1 + η t .

(5)

Replacing the forecast with its realized value, we get
xt = β 0 + β 1 xt+1 + β 2 (it − π t+1 ) + β 3 xt−1 + µt ,

(6)

where µt = β 1 (xet+1 − xt+1 ) + β 2 (π et+1 − π t+1 ).
As in the case of the New-Keynesian Phillips curve, this equation can
be estimated by GMM, appropriately corrected for the presence of an MA
component in the error term µt . As in our estimates of the New-Keynesian
Phillips curve, we use three lags of x, i and π as instruments. The results are
reported in the first column of the second panel of Table 1 The coeﬃcient on
xet+1 is slightly larger than 0.5 and significant, and the coeﬃcient on xt−1 is
also close to 0.5 and significant. These values are in line with those in Fuhrer
and Rudebusch (2002), who found lower values when using ML estimation
rather than GMM and the positive sign of the real interest in the equation
for the output gap is similar to the Fuhrer-Rudebusch results when they used
HP de-trending.
As with the New-Keynesian Phillips curve, we estimate Equation (6)
simultaneously together with a sub-VAR(1) as in (3), but here for the forcing
variables π t and it . Again, the significance of the coeﬃcients in the VAR(1)
equations (in particular those for lagged π t in the it equation) lends support
to their relevance as instruments. The numerical values of the estimated
parameters for the Euler equation remain nearly unchanged. However, as in
11

the case of the Phillips curve above, the precision of the estimators increases
substantially. These results are reported in the second column of the second
panel in Table 1.
In order to complete our building blocks for a forward looking system we
finally also model the interest rate with a Taylor rule as in Clarida, Galí and
Gertler (1998, 2000). Our starting point here is the equation
i∗t = i + γ 1 (π et+1 − π ∗t ) + γ 2 (xt − x∗t ),

(7)

where i∗t is the target nominal interest rate, i is the equilibrium rate, xt is
real output, and π∗t and x∗t are the desired levels of inflation and output.
The parameter γ 1 indicates whether the target real rate adjusts to stabilize
inflation (γ 1 > 1) or to accommodate it (γ 1 < 1), while γ 2 measures the
concern of the central bank for output stabilization.
Following the literature, we introduce a partial adjustment mechanism of
the actual rate to the target rate i∗ :
it = (1 − γ 3 )i∗t + γ 3 it−1 + vt ,

(8)

where the smoothing parameter γ 3 satisfies 0 ≤ γ 3 ≤ 1, and vt is an i.i.d.
(0, σ 2v ) error term. Combining (7) and (8), we obtain

it = γ 0 + (1 − γ 3 )γ 1 (πet+1 − π ∗t ) + (1 − γ 3 )γ 2 (xt − x∗t ) + γ 3 it−1 + vt

(9)

where γ 0 = (1 − γ 3 )i, which becomes
it = γ 0 + (1 − γ 3 )γ 1 (π t+1 − π ∗t ) + (1 − γ 3 )γ 2 (xt − x∗t ) + γ 3 it−1 + t ,
with

t

(10)

= (1 − γ 3 )γ 1 (π et+1 − π t+1 ) + vt , after replacing the forecasts with their

realized values
The results for single equation GMM estimation (with 3 lags as instruments) are reported in the first column of the third panel of Table 1. As in
12

Clarida et al (1998, 2000), the coeﬃcient on future inflation is larger than
one. We also found the coeﬃcient on output to be larger than one, although
the standard errors around both point estimates are rather large. Again, as
in the cases of single equation estimations of the Phillips curve and the Euler
equation, we are able to reduce the variance of our point estimates by adding
sub-VAR(1) equations for the forcing variables π t and xt when estimating the
resulting system by GMM (see column 2). As above, for both approaches we
have used up to three lags for the intrument variables.
We are now in a position to estimate the full forward looking system,
composed of Equations (1), (5) and (9):
π t = α0 + α1 πet+1 + α2 xt + α3 π t−1 + et ,

(11)

xt = β 0 + β 1 xet+1 + β 2 (it − π et+1 ) + β 3 xt−1 + η t ,
it = γ 0 + (1 − γ 3 )γ 1 (π et+1 − π ∗t ) + (1 − γ 3 )γ 2 (xt − x∗t ) + γ 3 it−1 + vt
The results are reported in column 3 of Table 1. For each of the three equations the estimated parameters are very similar to those obtained either in
the single equation case or in the systems completed with VAR equations.
Furthermore, the reductions in the standard errors of the estimated parameters are similar to those obtained with sub-VAR(1) specifications. Since the
VAR equations can be interpreted as reduced forms of the forward looking
equations, this result suggests that completing a single equation of interest
with a reduced form may be enough to achieve as much eﬃciency as within a
full system estimation. However, the full forward looking system represents
a more coherent choice from an econometric point of view, and the finding
that the forward looking variables have large and significant coeﬃcients in
all the three equations lends credibility to the complete rational expectations
model.
The nonlinearity of our system of forward looking equations makes the
13

evaluation of global identification impossible. However, if we linearize the
model around the estimated parameters and focus on local identification,
we can show that the model is (at least) exactly identified, see Beyer et al
(2005). Exact identification holds when the point estimates imply a determinate solution. The model would be potentially overidentified in case of an
indeterminate equilibrium.

3

Robustness analysis

While system estimation increases eﬃciency, the full forward looking model
in (11) could still suﬀer from mis-specification problems, see e.g. Canova
and Sala (2006). To evaluate this possibility, we conducted four types of
diagnostic tests. First, we ran an LM test on the residuals of each equation
to check for additional serial correlation i.e. serial correlation beyond the
one that is due to the MA(1) error structure of the model. Second, we ran
the Jarque and Bera normality test on the estimated errors. Although our
GMM estimation approach is robust to the presence of non-normal errors,6
rejection of normality could signal other problems, such as the presence of
outliers or parameter instability. Third, we ran an LM test to check for the
presence of ARCH eﬀects; rejection of the null of no ARCH eﬀects might
more generally be a signal of changes in the variance of the errors. Finally,
we checked for parameter constancy by running recursive estimates of the
forward looking system.
The results of our mis-specification tests are reported in the bottom lines
of each panel in Table 2. For convenience, we also present in column 1
again the estimated parameters. There are only minor problems of residual
correlation in the inflation equation, but normality is strongly rejected for
6

Note that this is not the case for maximum likelihood estimation.

14

the inflation and interest rate equation and the interest rate equation also
fails the test for absence of serial correlation and absence of ARCH.
The rejection of correct specification could be due to parameter instability
in the full sample 1970:3 - 1998:4. Instability might be caused by a variety of
sources including external events such as the oil shocks, internal events, such
as the reduction in the volatility of output (e.g. McConnell and Perez-Quiros
(2000)), or changes in the monetary policy targets. Since we had more faith
in the second part of our sample, we implemented a backward recursion by
estimating the system first for the subsample 1988:1-1998:4, and recursively
reestimating the system by adding one quarter of data to the beginning of the
sample, i.e. our second subsample consisted of the quarters 1987:4—1998:4,
our third was 1987:3 — 1998:4 and so on until 1970:3-1998:4.
In Figure 1, we report recursive parameter estimates. These graphs confirm that the likely source of the rejection of ARCH, normality and serial
correlation tests is the presence of parameter change. Although the parameter estimates are stable back to 1985:1, going further back than this is
associated with substantial parameter instability in all three equations, and
particularly in the estimated Taylor rule. Although parameter instability
is more pronounced when we use unemployment as a measure of economic
activity, it is also present in estimates obtained when using the output gap.
Overall, these mis-specification tests cast serious doubts on results obtained for the full sample, and they suggest that a prudent approach would
be to restrict our analysis to a more homogeneous sample. For this reason,
in the subsequent analysis, we report results only for the subperiod 1985:11998:4.
Our subsample results are presented in the second column of Table 2. It
is interesting to note that the values of the estimated parameters of the NewKeynesian Phillips curve and the Euler equation are similar to those obtained

15

for the full sample. However, parameter estimates of the coeﬃcients of the
Taylor rule diﬀer substantially from the single equation estimates. Most
prominently, there is a marked decrease in the estimated coeﬃcient on the
output gap. In the post 1985 subsample we fail to reject the null hypothesis
for all four of our diagnostic tests, thereby lending additional credibility to
our estimation results.
The final issue we briefly consider is the role of the method of estimation. Fuhrer and Rudebusch (2002), Lindé (2005) and Jondeau and Le Bihan (2003) have suggested that GMM may lead to an upward bias in the
parameters associated with the forward looking variables, while maximum
likelihood (ML) produces better results. For example Lindé (2005) finds
that estimated parameters were not heavily biased from true parameters. In
case of exact identification ML coincides with indirect least squares where
the reduced form parameters of the model are mapped back into those of the
structural form. We compared our estimates with the point estimates from
GMM by computing the indirect least squares estimates from the reduced
form. Using this approach, we find that our GMM estimates are similar to
the ML values.
For the subsample 1985-1998, the estimated coeﬃcient on πet+1 in the
inflation equation is 0.76 and 0.62 for that on future expected output gap
in the Euler equation whereas the GMM estimates of these parameters are,
respectively, 0.61 and 0.47. The diﬀerences are slightly larger for the coeﬃcient on future inflation in the Taylor rule, in the range 2.1 − 2.4 with ML.
Overall we are reassured that our finding of significant coeﬃcients on future
expected variables is robust to alternative system estimation methods.

Enlarging the information set

The analysis in Sections 2 and 3 supports the use of a system approach to the
estimation of forward looking equations. For the 1985:1—1998:4 sample, our
estimated system passes a wide range of mis-specification tests. Moreover,
the Hansen’s J-statistic, reported at the foot of Table 2, is unable to reject
the null of relevant instruments for this period (but it is worth recalling the
caveats on the use of the J-test in this context). However, there could still
be problems of weak instruments and/or omitted variables which are hardly
detectable using standard tests, (see e.g. Mavroeidis (2005)). This section
proposes a method that can potentially address both of these issues.
Our approach is to augment our data by adding information extracted
from a large set of 146 macroeconomic variables as described in Stock and
Watson (2002a, 2002b, SW). We assume that these variables are driven by a
few common forces, i.e. the factors, plus a set of idiosyncratic shocks. This
assumption implies that the factors provide an exhaustive summary of the
information in the large dataset, so that they may alleviate omitted variable
problems when used as additional regressors in our small system. Moreover,
the factors extracted from the Stock and Watson data are known to have
good forecasting performance for the macroeconomic variables in our small
dataset and they are therefore likely to be useful as additional instruments
that may alleviate weak instrument problems, too. Bernanke and Boivin
(2003) and Favero, Marcellino and Neglia (2005) showed that when estimated
factors are included in the instrument set for GMM estimation of Taylor
rules, the precision of the parameter estimators increases substantially. The
economic rationale for inclusion of these variables is that central bankers rely
on a large set of indicators in the conduct of monetary policy; our extracted
factors may provide a proxy for this additional information. An additional
reason for being interested in the inclusion of factors in our analysis is that,
17

the inclusion of factors in small scale VARs has been shown to remove the
“price puzzle” suggesting that factors may be used to reduce or eliminate
the estimation bias, that arises from the omission of relevant right-hand-side
variables.7
In the following subsection, we present a brief overview on the specification and estimation of factor models for large datasets. Following this discussion, we evaluate whether the use of the estimated factors changes the size
and or the significance of the coeﬃcients of the forward looking components
in the New Keynesian model.

4.1

The factor model

Equation (12) represents a general formulation of the dynamic factor model
zt = Λft + ξ t ,

(12)

where zt is an N × 1 vector of variables and ft is an r × 1 vector of common
factors. We assume that r is much smaller than N, and we represent the
eﬀects of ft on zt by the N ×r matrix Λ. ξ it is an N ×1 vector of idiosyncratic
shocks.
Stock and Watson require the factors, ft , to be orthogonal although they
may be correlated in time and with the idiosyncratic components for each
factor.8 Notice that the factors are not identified since Equation (12) can be
rewritten as
zt = ΛGG−1 ft + ξ t = Ψpt + ξ t ,
where pt is an alternative set of factors and G is an arbitrary invertible r × r
matrix. This fact makes it diﬃcult to form a structural interpretation of the

factors, but it does not prevent their use as a summary of the information
contained in zt .
SW define the estimators fbt as minimizing the objective function
VN,T (f, Λ) =

(zit − Λi ft )2 .
NT i=1 t=1

Under the hypothesis of r common factors, they show that the optimal estimators of the factors are the r eigenvectors corresponding to the r largest
P
0
eigenvalues of the T × T matrix N −1 N
i=1 z i z i , where z i = (zi1 , ..., ziT ).

Moreover, the r eigenvectors corresponding to the r largest eigenvalues of
P
0
the N × N matrix T −1 Tt=1 zt zt are the optimal estimators of Λ. These
eigenvectors coincide with the principal components of zt ; they are also the

OLS estimators of the coeﬃcients in a regression of zit on the k estimated
factors fbt , i = 1, ..., N .9 Although there are alternative estimation methods
available such as the one by Forni and Reichlin (1998) or Forni et al (2000),

we chose the SW approach since there is some evidence to suggest that it
dominates the alternatives in this context.10
No statistical test is currently available to determine the optimal number
of factors. SW and Bai and Ng (2002) suggested minimizing a particular
information criterion, however its small sample properties in the presence of
heteroskedastic idiosyncratic errors deserves additional investigation. In their
9

SW prove that when r is correctly specified, fbt converges in probability to ft , up to

an arbitrary r × r transformation matrix, G. When k factors are assumed, with k > r,

k − r estimated factors are redundant linear combinations of the elements of ft , while even
when k < r consistency for the first k factors is preserved (because of the orthogonality
hypothesis). See Bai (2003) for additional inferential results.
10
Kapetanios and Marcellino (2006a) found that SW’s estimator performs better in
simulation experiments, and Favero et al. (2005) reached the same conclusion when using
the estimated factors for the estimation of Taylor rules and VARs.

19

empirical analysis with this data set, SW found that the first 2-3 factors
are the most relevant for forecasting key US macroeconomic variables. In
the following analysis we however evaluate the role of up to six factors to
make sure suﬃcient information is captured. Finally, Bai and Ng (2006a)
have shown that the estimated factors when used in subsequent econometric
√
analyses do not create any generated regressor problem when T /N is op (1).
This condition requires the number of variables to grow faster than the sample
size, which basically guarantees faster convergence of the factor estimators
than of the estimators of the other parameters of interest. We assume that
√
this condition is satisfied in our context, where T /N = 0.055.

4.2

The role of the estimated factors

As we mentioned, the estimated factors can proxy for omitted variables in
the specification of the forward looking equations. In particular, we use up
to six contemporaneous factors as additional regressors in each of the three
structural equations, and retain those which are statistically significant.
Since the factors are potentially endogenous, we use their first lag as additional instruments. These lags are likely to be useful also for the other
endogenous variables in each structural equation. Bai and Ng (2006b) and
Kapetanios and Marcellino (2006b) provide a detailed derivation of the properties of factor-based GMM estimators.
In column 3 of Table 2 we report the results of GMM estimation of the
forward looking system over the period 1985-1998.
First, a few factors are strongly significant in the equations for inflation
and the real variable. While it is diﬃcult to provide an economic interpretation for this result, it does point to the omission of relevant regressors in the
Phillips curve and Euler equation. In contrast, no factors are significant in
the Taylor rule, which indicates that output gap and inflation expectations
20

are indeed the key driving variables of monetary policy over this period.
Second, in general the estimated parameters of the forward looking variables are 10 to 20% lower than those without factors, but they remain
strongly statistically significant.
Third, the precision of the estimators systematically increases, as the
standard errors of the estimated parameters are 10 to 50% lower than those
without the factors. This confirms the usefulness of the additional information contained in the factors.
Fourth, since the highest lag order of the regressors in the structural
model is one, it could suﬃce to include one lag of π t , xt , and it in the
instrument set instead of three lags. In this case, the point estimates are
unaﬀected, as expected, but the standard errors increase substantially. This
finding suggests that the solution of the system could be indeterminate, in
which case more lags would indeed be required.
Finally, since there is no consensus on the best way to compute robust
standard errors in this context, we verified the robustness of our findings
based on Newey West (1994) comparing them with those based on Andrews
(1991). The latter are in general somewhat lower, but the advantages resulting from the use of factors are still systematically present.

Conclusions

In this paper we provided a general econometric framework for the analysis
of models with rational expectations, focusing in particular on the hybrid
version of the New-Keynesian Phillips curve that has attracted considerable
attention in the recent period.
First, we showed that system estimation methods where the New-Keynesian
Phillips curve is complemented with equations for the interest rate and ei-

21

ther unemployment or the output gap yield more eﬃcient parameter estimates than traditional single equation estimation, while there are only minor
changes in the point estimates and the expected future variables play an important role in all the three equations. The latter result remains valid even
if MLE is used rather than system GMM.
Second, we stressed that it is important to evaluate the correct specification of the model, and we showed that our systems provide a proper statistical framework for the variables over the 1985-1998 period, while during the
’70s there is evidence of parameter changes, in particular in the interest rate
equation.
Third, we analyzed the role of factors that summarize the information
contained in a large data set of U.S. macroeconomic variables. Some factors
were found to be significant as additional regressors in the New-Keynesian
Phillips curve and in the Euler equation, alleviating potential omitted variable problems. Moreover, using lags of the factors as additional instruments
in our small New-Keynesian system, the standard errors of the GMM estimates systematically decrease for all the estimated parameters; the gains are
particularly large for the coeﬃcients of forward looking variables.
In conclusion, using the factors, data after 1985 is not inconsistent with
the New-Keynesian interpretation of a determinate equilibrium driven by
three fundamental shocks. The estimated parameters of the complete model
form a consistent picture which coincides with New-Keynesian economic theory. We should note that while our results support the relevance of forward
looking variables in our estimated equations there is a large variety of alternative models compatible with the observed data which can have very diﬀerent
properties both in terms of the relevance of the forward looking variables
and of the characteristics of their dynamic evolution. This has been demonstrated in Beyer and Farmer (2003b). A more detailed analysis of this issue

22

represents an interesting topic for further research in this field.
