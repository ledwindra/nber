1. Introduction
Financial market volatility is central to the theory and practice of asset pricing, asset allocation, and risk
management. Although m ost textbook mod els as sum e volatilitie s and corre lations to be constant, it is
widely recognized among both finance academics and practitioners that they vary importantly over
time. This recognition has spurred an extensive and vibrant research program into the distributional
and dynam ic properties of stock market volatility. 1 Most of what w e have learned from this bu rgeoning
literature is based on the estimation of parametric AR CH or stochastic volatility models for the
underlying returns, or on the analysis of implied volatilities from options or other derivatives prices.
However, the validity of such volatility measures generally depends upon specific distributional
assum ptions, and in the case of implied volatilities, further assum ptions concerning the market price of
volatility risk. As such, the existence of multiple compe ting models immediately calls into question the
robustness of previous findings. An alternative approach, based for example on squared returns over
the relevant return horizon, provides model-free unbiased estimates of the ex-post realized volatility.
Unfortunately, however, squared returns are also a very noisy volatility indicator and hence do not
allow for re liable inference regarding the true underlying latent volatility.
The limitations of the traditional procedures m otivate the different approach for measuring and
analyzing the properties of stock market volatility adopted in this paper. Using continuously recorded
transactions prices, we construct estimates of ex-post realized daily volatilities by summing squares
and cross -products of intrada y high-fre quency returns . Volatility estim ates so constru cted are m odelfree, and as the s ampling frequency of the returns approaches infinity, they are also, in theory, free from
measurement error (Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Labys, henceforth ABDL, 2000).2 The need
for reliable high-frequency return observations suggests, however, that our approach will work most
effectively for actively traded stocks. We focus on the thirty stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial

Nelson (1990, 1992 ) and Nelson and Fos ter (1994) obtain a related by different result: mis-specified ARCH models
may work as consistent filters for the latent instantaneous vola tili ty as the retu rn h oriz on a ppr oaches zero. Simil arl y,
Ledoit and Santa-Clara (1998) show that the Black-Scholes implied volatility for an at-the-money option provides a
consiste nt estim ate of the und erlying laten t instan taneous volatility as t he time to m aturity ap proaches zero.

Average (DJIA), both for computational tractability and because of our intrinsic interest in the Dow,
but the empirical findings carry over to a random sample of thirty other liquid stocks. In sp ite of
restricting the analysis to actively traded stocks, market microstructure frictions, including price
discreteness, infrequent trading, and bid-ask bounce effects, are still operative. In order to mitigate
these effects, w e use a five-minute retu rn horizon as the effective “continuous time record.” Treating
the resulting daily time series of realized variances and covariances constructed from a five-year
sample of five-minute returns for the thirty DJIA stocks as being directly observable allows us to
characterize the distributional features of the volatilities without attempting to fit multivariate ARCH or
stochastic volatility models.
Our approach is directly in line with earlier work by French, Schwert and Stambaugh (1987),
Schwert (1989, 1990a, 1990b), and Schwert and Seguin (1991), who rely primarily on daily return
observations for the construction of monthly realized stock volatilities.3 The earlier studies, however,
do not provide a formal justification for such meas ures, and the diffusion-theoretic underpinnings
provided her e explicitly hinge on the length of the return hor izon approaching zero. Intuitively,
following the work of Merton (198 0) and Ne lson (1992), for a continuous time diffusion process, the
diffusion coefficient can be estimated arb itrarily well with sufficiently finely sampled observations, and
by the theory of quadratic variation, this same idea carries over to estimates of the integrated volatility
over fixed horizons. As such, the use of high-frequency returns plays a critical role in justifying our
measur ements. M oreover, our focus centers on daily, as oppos ed to m onthly, volatility measures. This
mirrors the focu s of most of the extant academ ic and indus try volatility literatures and more clearly
highlights the important intertemporal volatility fluctuations.4 Finally, because our methods are trivial
to implement, even in the high-dimensional situations relevant in practice, w e are able to stud y the
distributional and dynamic p roperties of correlations in much greater depth than is possible with
traditional multivariate ARCH or stochastic volatility models, which rapidly become intractable as the
number of assets grows.

monthl y sample s tanda rd deviati ons wit h various alternat ive volatility mea sures b ased on the disp ersion of the retu rns on
individu al stocks in the ma rket index.

Schwert (1990a), Hsieh (199 1), and Fung an d Hsieh (1991) also stud y daily standard deviations based on 15-min ute
equity returns. However, their analysis is strictly univariate and decidedly less broad in scope than ours.

Turning to the results, we find it useful to segment them into unconditional and conditional
aspects of the distributions of volatilities and correlations. As regards the unconditional distributions,
we find that the distributions of the realized daily variances are highly non-normal and skewed to the
right, but that the logarithms of the realized variances are app roximately normal. Similarly, although
the unconditional distribu tions of the covarianc es ar e all ske wed to the right, the realiz ed daily
correlations appear approximate ly normal. Finally, although the unconditional daily return distributions
are leptokurtic, the daily returns normalized by the realized standard deviations are also close to
normal. Rather remarkably, these results hold for the vast majority of the 30 volatilities and 435
covariances/correlations associated with the 30 Dow Jones stocks, as well as the 30 actively traded
stocks in our randomly selected control sample.
Moving to conditional aspects of the distributions, all of the volatility measures fluctuate
substantially over time, and all displa y strong dynam ic dep endence. M oreover, this dep endence is
well-characterized by slowly mean reverting fractionally integrated process es with a degree of
integration, d, around 0.35, as further underscored by the existence of very precise scaling laws under
temporal aggregation. Although statistically significant, we find that the much debated leverage-effect,
or asymmetry in the relationship betw een past ne gative and positive returns and future volatilities , is
relatively unimportant from an economic perspective. Interestingly, the same type of asymmetry is also
present in the realized correlations. Finally, there is a systematic tendency for the variances to m ove
together, and for the correlations am ong the different stocks to be high/low when the variances for the
underlying stocks are high/low, and when the correlations among the other stocks are also high/low.
Although several of these features have been documented previously for U.S. equity returns,
the existing evidence relies almost exclusively on the estimation of specific parametric volatility
mode ls. In contras t, the stylized facts for the thirty DJIA stocks documented here a re ex plicitly modelfree. Moreover , the facts extend the e xisting results in important directions and both solidify and
expand on the mor e limited set of results for the tw o exchange rates in AB DL (19 99a, 200 0) and the
DJIA stock index in Ebens (199 9a). As such, our findings set the stage for the development of
improved volatility models – possibly involving a simple factor structure, w hich appears cons istent
with many of our empirical findings – and corres ponding out-of-samp le volatility forecasts, consistent

-3-

with the distributional characteristics of the returns.5 Of cou rse, the pr actica l use of such models in
turn should allow for better risk management, portfolio allocation, and asset pricing decisions.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we pr ovide a brief account of
the diffusion-theoretic underpinnings of our realized volatility measures, along with a discussion of the
actual data and volatility calculations. In section 3 we discus s the unconditional univariate return,
volatility and correlation distributions, and we move to dynamic aspects, including long-memory effects
and scaling laws, in section 4. In section 5 we assess the symmetry of responses of realized volatilities
and correlations to unexp ected shocks. We report on multivariate aspects of the volatility and
correlation distributions in section 6, and in section 7 we illustrate the consistency of several of our
empirical results w ith a simple model of factor structu re in volatility. We conclude in section 8 with a
brief summ ary of our main findings and some sugge stions for future research.

2. Realized Volatility Measurem ent
2.1 Theory
Here we provide a discussion of the theoretical justification behind our volatility measurements. For a
more thorough treatment of the pertinent issues within the context of special semimartingales we refer
to ABDL (2000) and the general discus sion of stochastic integration in Protter (1992 ). To set out the
basic idea and intuition, assume that the logarithmic N×1 vector price process, pt , follows a
multivariate continuous-time s tochastic volatility diffusion,

dpt = : t dt + S t dWt ,

(1)

where Wt denotes a standard N-dimensional Brownian motion, the process for the N×N positive
definite diffusion matrix, S t , is strictly stationary, and we normalize the unit time interval, or h = 1, to
repres ent one trading day. Conditional on the sample pa th realization of : t and S t , the distribution of
the continuously compounded h-period returns, rt+h,h / pt+h - pt , is then

rt+h,h * F{ :t+J , St+J }hJ =0 - N( I h0 :t+J dJ , I h0 St+J dJ ) ,

5

Ebens (1999a), for example, makes a n initial attempt at modeling univaria te realized stock volatility for the DJIA
index.

-4-

(2)

where F{ :t+J , St+J }hJ =0 denotes the F-field generate d by the sam ple paths of : t+ J and S t+ J for 0#J#h. The
integrated diffusion matrix thus provides a natural measure of the true latent h-per iod volatility. This
notion of integrated volatility already plays a central role in the stochastic volatility option pricing
literature, where the price of an option typically depends on the distribution of the integrated volatility
process for the u nderlying asset over the life of the option.6
By the theory of quadratic variation, we have that under weak regularity conditions,

E j= 1,...,[h/)] rt + jA),) A rNt + jA),) - Ih0 S t+ J dJ 6 0

(3)

almos t sur ely for all t as the sampling frequency of the returns increases, or ) 6 0. Thus, by sum ming
sufficiently finely-sampled high-frequency returns, it is possible to construct ex-post realized volatility
measures for the integrated latent volatilities that are asymptotically free of measurement error.7 This
contrasts sharply with the common use of the cross-product of the h-period returns, rt+h , h A rNt +h,h , as a
simple ex-post volatility measure. Although the squared return over the forecast horizon provides an
unbiased es timate for the realized integrated volatility, it is an extremely noisy estimator, and
predictable variation in the true latent volatility process is typically dwarfed by measurement error.8
Moreover, for longer horizons any conditional mean dependence will tend to contaminate this variance
measure. In contrast, as the length of the return horizon decreases the impact of the drift term
vanishes, so that the mean is effectively annihilated.
These ass ertions remain valid if the underlying continuous time process in equation (1) contains
jumps, so long as the price process is a special semimartingale, which will hold if it is arbitrage-free
(see, e.g., B ack, 1991 ). Of course , in this case the limit of the summation of the high-frequency returns
will involve an additional jump component, but the interpretation of the sum as the realized h-period

6

See, for example, the well-known contribution of Hull and White (1987).

7

Consider the simple case of univariate discretely sampled i.i.d. normally distributed mean-zero returns; i.e., N = 1, : t
= 0, and S t = F 2 . It follows by standard arguments that E( h -1 AE j=1,...,[ h/)] r 2t +jA),) ) = F 2 , while Var( h -1 AE j=1,...,[ h/)] r 2t +jA),) ) =
() /h)A2AF 4 6 0 , as ) 6 0.

In em piric ally rea listi c situ ation s, th e varia nce of r t+1,1 r Nt +1,1 is easily twenty times the variance of the true daily
integrated volatility, I10 S t+J d J ; see Andersen and Bollerslev (1998) for some numerical results along these lines.

retu rn vola tility remains intact; for further discuss ion along thes e lines see ABD L (2000 ). Importantly,
in the presence of jumps the conditional distribution of the returns in equation (2) is no longer
Gau ssian. As such, the c orresponding em pirical distribution of the s tandardiz ed re turns speaks directly
to the relevance of allowing for jumps in the underlying continuous time proces s when analyzing the
returns over longer h-period horizons. Of course, viewed as a non-parametric omnibus test for jumps,
this may not be a very powerful procedure.9
2.2 Data
Our empirical analysis is based on data from the TAQ (Trade And Quotation) database. The TAQ
data files contain continuously recorded information on the trades and quotations for the securities
listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange ( NYS E), American Stock Exchange (A MEX ), and the
National Association of Secur ity Dealers A utomated Quotation s ystem (NASDAQ) . The d atabase is
published monthly, and has been available on CD-ROM from the NYS E since January 1993; we refer
the reader to the corr esponding data manual for a more comp lete description of the actual data and the
method of data-ca pture. O ur samp le extends from J anuary 2, 199 3 until May 29, 1998, for a total of
1,366 trading days. A complete analysis based on all trades for all stocks, although straightforward
conceptually, is infeasible in practice. We therefore restrict our analysis to the thirty DJIA firms, which
also helps to ensure a r easonable degree of liquidity. A list of the relevant ticker symbols as of the
reconfiguration of the DJIA index in March 1997 is contained in Andersen, Bollerslev, D iebold and
Ebens (2000) (henceforth, ABDE).
Although the DJIA stocks are among the most actively traded U.S. equities, the median intertrade duration for all stocks across the full sample is 23.1 seconds , ranging from a low of 7 seconds for
Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK) to a high of 54 seconds for United Technologies C orp. (UT X). As such, it is
not practically feasible to push the continuous record asymptotics and the length of the observation
interval ) in equation (3) beyond this level. Moreover, because of the organizational structure of the
market, the available quotes and transaction prices are subject to discrete clustering and bid-ask bounce
effects. Such market microstructure features are generally not important when analyzing longer
horizon interdaily returns but can seriously distort the distributional properties of high-frequency
intraday returns; see, e.g., the textbook treatment by Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay (1997). Thus,

9

A similar idea underlies the test for jumps in Drost, Nijman and Werker (1998), based on a comparison of the
sample kurtosis an d the population kurtosis implied by a continuous time GA RCH(1,1) model; see also A BDL (1999a).

following the analysis in Andersen and Bollerslev (1997), we rely on artificially constructed fiveminute returns.10 With the daily transaction record extending from 9:30 EST until 16:05 EST, there are
a total 79 five-minute returns for each day, corresp onding to ) = 1/79 . 0.0127 in the notation above.
The five-minute horizon is short enough so that the accuracy of the continuous record asymptotics
underlying our realized volatility measures w ork well, and long enough so that the confounding
influences from market microstructure frictions are not overwhelming; see ABDL (1999b) for further
discussion along these lines.11
2.3 Construction of Realized Equity Volatilities
The five-minute return series are constructed from the logarithmic difference between the prices
recorded at or immediately before the corr esponding five-minute m arks. Althou gh the limiting res ult in
equation (3) is independent of the value of the drift parameter, : t, the use of a fixed discrete time
interval may allow de pendence in the mean to systematically bias our volatility measures. Thus , in
order to purge the high-frequency returns of the negative serial correlation induced by the uneven
spacing of the observed prices and the inherent bid-ask spread, we first estimate an MA(1) model for
each of the five-minute return series using the full five-year sample. Consistent with the spurious
dependence that would b e induced b y non-synchronous trading and bid-as k bounce effects , all
estimated moving-average coefficients are negative, with a median value of -0.214 across the thirty
stocks. We denote the corresponding thirty demeaned MA(1 )-filtered re turn ser ies of 79×1,366 =
107,914 five-minute returns by rt+ ),).12 Finally, to avoid any confusion, we denote the daily unfiltered
raw returns by a single time subscript; i.e., rt where t = 1, 2, ..., 1,336.
The realized daily covariance matrix is then

Covt / E j=1,..,1/) rt + jA),) A rNt + jA),) ,

(4)

10

An alternative, and much m ore complicated approach, would be to utilize all of the observations by explicitly
modeling the high-frequency frictions.
11

As detailed below, the average daily variance of the "typical" DJIA stock equals 3.109. Thus, in the case of i.i.d.
normally distributed returns, it follows that a five-minute sampling frequency translates into a variance for the daily
varia nce es tima tes of 0.245.
12

We also experimented with the use of unfiltered and linearly interpolated five-minute returns, which produced very
similar results.

-7-

where t = 1, 2, ..., 1,366 and ) = 1/79. For notational simplicity we refer to realized daily variances
given by the diagonal elements as v2j ,t / { Covt }j,j, and the corresponding daily logarithmic standard
deviations as lvj,t / log(v j,t ). Sim ilarly, we d enote the realized daily corre lations by Corri,j,t / { Covt }i,j /(
vi,tAvj,t ). In addition to the daily measures, we also briefly consider the statistical properties of various
multi-day volatility measures, whose construction follows in straightforward fashion from equation (4)
by extending the summation to cover h/) intervals, where h > 1 denotes the multiday horizon.
Because volatility is now effectively observable, we may rely on conventional statistical
procedures for characterizing its distributional properties. In the next section we proceed to do so. Of
course, it is poss ible the thirty DJIA stocks analyzed here do not provide a representative picture of the
return volatility for other actively traded stocks. As a robustness check we replicated the empirical
analysis for a set of thirty randomly selected liquid stocks, picked from the 214 stocks with at least 158
trades pe r day at the beginning, middle and end of the sam ple period. Importantly, all of the results for
this randomly selected sample match closely those reported below for the DJIA stocks, thus
underscoring the general nature of ou r findings. However, for rea sons of space conservation, w e shall
not discuss the parallel empirical findings here; instead, we refer the interested reader to ABDE (2000)
for detailed discussion and a full set of tables.

3. Univariate Unconditional Return and V olatility Distributions
3.1 Returns
A voluminous literature, seeking to characterize the unconditional distribution of speculative returns,
has evolved over the past three decades.13 Consistent with this litera ture, the summ ary statistics in
Table 1 show that the daily DJIA returns, rj,t, have fatter tails than the normal and, for the majority of
the stocks, are also skewed to the right.14
Quite remarkably, however, the next set of numbers in Table 1 indicate that all of the thirty
standardized return series, rj,t/vj,t , are approximately unconditionally normally distributed. In particular,

13

In early contributions, M andelbrot (19 63) and F ama (19 65) argued that the Stab le Paretian dis tributions provid e a
good approximation. Subsequently, however, Praetz (1972) and Blattberg and Gonedes (1974), among many others, found
that finite variance-mixtures of normals, such as the student-t distribution, generally afford better characterizations.
14

Under the null hypothesis of i.i.d. normally distributed returns, the sample skewn ess and kurtosis are as ymptotically
norm al w ith m eans of 0 and 3, and varia nces of 6/T and 24/T, where T denotes sample size. Thus for T = 1,366 the two
standard errors are 0.066 and 0.133.

-8-

the median value of the sample kurtosis is reduced from 5.416 for the raw re turns to only 3.129 for the
standardiz ed returns . This is also evident from Figure 1, which plots the kernel density estimate for the
mean-z ero and unit-variance standard ized returns for Alcoa Inc. (AA), the first of the thirty DJIA
stocks, alphabetically by ticker symbol . The close approximation afforded by the normal reference
density is striking.15 This result stands in sharp contrast to the leptokur tic distributions for the
standardized daily returns that typically obtain when relying on an estimate of the one-day-ahead
conditional variance fr om a param etric ARC H or stochastic volatility model; s ee e.g., Bollerslev, Engle
and Nelson (19 94) for a general discu ssion, and Kim and Kon (1994) for explicit results related to the
distributions of the DJIA s tocks over an earlier time period. The results in Table 1 a lso imply that the
unconditional distribution for the returns should be well approximated by a continuous variance
mixture of normals, as determined by the unconditional distribution for the mixing variable, v2j ,t . The
following section details this distribution.
3.2 Variances and Logarithmic Standard Deviations
The first four columns in Table 2 provide the same set of summary statistics for the unconditional
distribution of the realized daily variances. The median value for the sample means is 3.109, implying
an annualized standard deviation for the typical stock of around 28 perc ent. H owever, there is
considera ble variation in the average volatility across the thirty stocks, ranging from a high of 42
percent for Walmar t Stores Inc. (WM T) to a low of 22 percent for UTX.16 The standard deviations
given in the sec ond column also indicate that the realiz ed daily volatilities fluctuate significantly
through time. Finally, it is evident from the third and the fourth columns that the distributions of the
realized variances are extremely right-skewed and leptokur tic. This may seem su rprising, as the
realized daily variances ar e based on the sum of 79 five-minute return observations. However, as
emphasiz ed by Andersen, Bollerslev and D as (2 000), intraday s pecu lative returns are strongly
dependent so that, even with much larger samples, standard Central Limit Theorem arguments often
provide very poor approximations in the high-frequency data context.
The next part of Table 2 refers to the realized logarithmic standard deviations, lvj,t .

15

The kernel d ensity estim ates are b ased on a Gaus sian k ernel and Silverma n’s (19 86) ba ndwid th. Sim ilar plots for
all of the other stocks are available in ABDE (2000).
16

Details regarding the individual s tocks are again available in ABD E (2000).

-9-

Intere stingly, the median value of the sam ple skewness acros s all of the thirty stocks is re duced to only
0.192, compared to 5.609 for the realized variances and , although the sample kurtos is for all but one of
the stocks e xcee d the normal value of three , the assumption of norm ality is obviously much better in
this case. This is also illustrated by Figure 2, in which we show estimates of the standardized
unconditional density for lvAA,t , along w ith the s tandard normal density. The normal app roxim ation is
very good.
This evidence is consistent with Taylor (1986) and French, Schwert and Stambaugh (1987),
who find that the dis tribu tion of logarithmic monthly stand ard d eviations cons tructed from the daily
returns w ithin the m onth is close to Gau ssian. It is also directly in line w ith the recent evidence in
ABDL (2 000) and Zum bach et al. (1999), which indicates that realized daily foreign exchange rate
volatilities constructed from high-frequency data are approximately log-normally distributed. Taken
together, the results in Tab les 1 and 2 imply that the unconditional distribution for the daily returns
should be w ell des cribed by a continuous lognormal-normal mixtur e, as advocated by Clar k (1973) in
his seminal treatment of the M ixture-of-Distr ibutions-Hypothesis (M DH). The results for the foreign
exchange rates in ABDL (1999c) corroborate this idea.
Our discussion thus far has centered on univariate return and volatility distributions. However,
asset pricing, portfolio selection, and risk manage ment decisions are invariably multivariate, involving
many assets, with correlated retu rns. The next section summar izes the unconditional distributions of
the pertinent realized covariances and correlations.
3.3 Covariances and Correlations
The realize d covariance matrix for the thirty DJIA stocks contains a total of 435 unique elem ents. In
Table 3 we report the med ian value of the sample mean, s tandard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis for
the covariances and correlations for each of the thirty stocks with respect to all of the twenty-nine other
stocks; i.e., the median value of the particular sample statistic across the 29 time series for stock i as
defined by Covi,j,t and Corri,j,t , where j = 1, 2, ..., 30, and j

i.

The median of the mean covariance across all of the stocks equals 0.373, while the typical
correlation among the DJIA stocks is around 0.113. However , the realized covariances and
correlations exhibit considerable variation across the different stocks and across time. F or instance, the
median of the average correlations for Union Carbide Corp. (UK) equals 0.080, whereas the median
for General Electric (GE) is as high as 0.150.

- 10 -

As with the realized variances, the distributions of the realized covariances are extremely right
skew ed and leptokurtic. Interestingly, however, the realize d correlations ap pear approxim ately
normally distributed. In particular, the median kurtosis for all of the 435 realiz ed covariances e quals
61.86, whereas the median kurtosis for the realized correlations equals 3.037. To illustrate this result,
Figure 3 graphs the unconditional distribution of the standardized realized correlations for AA with
respect to Exxon Corp. (XON), the alphabetically last ticker symbol of the thirty DJIA stocks.17 It is
obvious that the standar d normal reference d ensity affords a close approx imation.
The unconditional distributions detailed above capture important aspects of the return
generating process, and they indicate that all of the realized volatilities vary importantly through time.
In the next section, we explore the associated dynamic dependence. Again, the use of realized
volatilities allows us to do so in a model-free environment, w ithout reliance on complicated and
intractable parametric latent volatility models.

4. Temporal D ependence, Long-Mem ory and Scaling
The conditional distribution of stock market volatility has been the subject of extensive research effort
during the past decade. Here we solidify and extend the findings in that literature; in particular, we
reinforce the existence of pronounced long-run dependence in volatility and show that this effect is also
pres ent in correlations. Motivated by the results of the pre vious section, we focus on the logarithmic
volatilities and correlations.
4.1 Logarithmic Standard Deviations
It is instructive first to consider the representative time series plot for lvAA,t in Figure 4. It is evident
that the ser ies is p ositively serially correlated, with distinc t periods of high and low volatility read ily
identifiable. This is, of course, a manifestation of the well docum ented volatility clustering effect, and
directly in line with the results reported in the extant ARCH and stochastic volatility literatures; see,
e.g., Lamoureux and Lastrapes (1990) or Kim and K on (1994) for es timation of GARCH models for
individual daily stock returns.
To underscore the significance of this effect more generally, the first column in Table 4
summarizes the values of the standard Ljung-Box portmanteau test for the joint significance of the first

17

Similar graphs for all of the other correlations with respect to XON are available in ABDE (2 000).

- 11 -

22 autocorrelations of lvj,t (about one month of trad ing days). The hypothesis of z ero au tocorrelations is
overwhelmingly rejected for all thirty stocks. The correlogram for AA in Figure 5 shows why. The
autocorrelations are systematically above the conventional Bartlett ninety-five percent confidence band,
the upper range of w hich is given by the flat dashed line, even at the longest displacement of 120 days
(approximately half a year). Similarly slow decay rates have been documented in the literature with
daily time series of absolute or squared returns spanning several decades (e.g., Crato and de Lima,
1993, and Ding, Granger and Engle, 1993), but the resu lts in Figure 5 are noteworthy in that the
sample “only” spans five-and-a-half years. In spite of this slow decay, the augmented Dickey-Fuller
tests, reported in the second column in Table 4, reject the null hypothesis of a unit root for all but four
of the stocks when judged by the conventional -2.86 five-percent critical value.18
In response to such findings, a number of recent studies have argued that the long-run
dependence in financial market volatility may be conveniently modeled by fractional integrated ARCH
or stochastic volatility models; see, e.g., Baillie, Bollerslev and Mikkelsen (1996), Breidt, Crato and de
Lima (199 8) and Robinson and Zaffaroni (1998). The log-periodogram r egression estimates for the
degree of fractional integration, or d, for the realized logarithmic volatilities, given in the third column
in Table 4, are directly in line with these studies, and all thirty estimates are very close to the median
value of 0.349 (see Gew eke and Porter-Huda k, 1993, and Robinson, 1995 , for formal discussion of the
log-periodogram regre ssion, often called GPH , technique), and highly statistically significantly different
from both 0 and 1.19 It is also evident that the implied hyperbolic decay rate, j2Ad-1 , superim pose d in
Figure 5, affords a close approximation to the correlogram for lvAA,t , and equally good fits obtain for
each of the 29 other stocks.

18

It is well known, however, that the outcome of standard unit root tests should be carefully interpreted with slowly
decaying processes; see, e.g., Schwert (1987).
19

The slow hyperboli c decay of the lon g-lag autocor relat ions, or equival ently the log-linear explosion of t he low-fre quency
spectrum, are both distinguishing features of a covariance stationary fractionally integrated, or I(d), process with 0 < d <½.
Accordingly, let I(T j ) denote the sample periodogram estimate for the spectrum at the jth Fourier frequency, T j = 2B j/T, j = 1,
2, ..., [T/2]. The GPH estimator for d is then based on the least squares regression,
log[ I(T j ) ] = $ 0 + $ 1 Alog(T j ) + uj ,
where j = 1, 2, ..., m, and d$ / -½A$ 1 is asymptotical ly normal with a s tandard error of BA(24Am)-1/2 . For the estimates in Table 4
we took m = [ 1,366 ] 3/5 = 76, thus imp lying an asymptotic st andard er ror of 0.074. This particular choice was motivated by
Deo and Hurvich (1999), who show that the GPH estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal provided that m = O(T -* ),
where * < 4dA( 1 +4 d )-1.

- 12 -

Another implication of the long-memory associated w ith fractional integration concerns the
behavior of the variance of partial sums. In particular, let [ xt ] h / E j=1 , .. , h xh A(t-1 )+ j , denote the h-fold
partial sum process for xt . If xt is fractionally integrated, the partial sums will obey a scaling law of the
form Var( [ xt ] h ) = cAh2 d + 1. Thus, given d and the unconditional variance at one aggregation level, it is
poss ible to calculate the implied variance for any other aggregation level. T o explore w hether this
implication of fractional integration is satisfied by our equity volatilities, we plot in Figure 6 the
logarithm of the variance of the partial sum of the daily realized logarithmic standard deviations,
log(Var[lvAA,t ]h ), against the logarithm of the aggregation level, log(h), for h = 1, 2,..., 30. The accuracy
of the fitted line, c + (2d+1)Alog(h), is striking.20 Moreover, the corresponding regression estimates for d
for all of stocks reported in the fourth column in Table 4, are generally very close to the GPH estimates.
4.2 Correlations
The estimation of parametric multivariate volatility models is notoriously difficult and, as a result,
relatively little is known about the temporal behavior of individual stock return correlations.21 The last
four columns of Table 4 provide our standard menu of summary statistics for the 435 series of daily
realized correlations. In accord ance with our convention in section 3.3 above, each entry gives the
median value of that particular statistic across the thirty stocks.
Turning to the results, the time series plot for CorrAA,XON,,t in Figure 7 suggests important
dependence and hence predictability in the correlations. This impression is confirmed b y the
correlogram in Figure 8 and the Ljung-Box p ortmanteau s tatistics for up to 22nd order serial correlation
reported in column 5 of Table 4.22 Moreover, as with the ADF tests for lvj,t , the tests for Corri,j,t
reported in the sixth column systematically reject the unit root hypothesis. Accordingly, the GPH
estimates for d are significantly different from zero (and unity), with typical values around 0.35. The
corresponding hyperbolic decay rate for CorrAA,XON,,t superimp osed in Figur e 8 and the s caling law in
Figure 9, in which we plot log(Var[CorrAA,XON,,t ]h ) against log(h), for h = 1, 2,..., 30, also reveal highly

20

LeBaron (1999) has recently demonstrated that apparent sca ling laws ma y arise for short-memory, but highly
persistent processes. In the present context, the hyperbolic decay in Figure 5 further buttresses the long-memory argument.
21

In a recent paper, C ampbell et a l. (2000) arg ue that althou gh the num ber of stocks required to ach ieve a given level
of diversification has increased noticeably over the past two decades, firm-specific volatility has also gone up, so that
individual stock return correlations have actually decreased over the same time period.
22

As in Figure 5, the flat dashed line denotes the upper range of the ninety-five percent Bartlett confidence band.

accurate fits.
Overall, our results thus far suggest that the univariate unconditional and conditional distributions
for the realized correlations closely mimic the qualitative characteristics of the realized volatilities
discussed earlier. We now turn to multivariate aspects of the distributions, focusing first on issues related
to asymmetry in the distributions of the volatilities.

5. Asymm etric Responses of Vo latilities and Correlations
A number of previous studies have documented an asymmetry in the relationship between equity
volatility and returns, i.e., positive returns have a s maller impact on future volatility than negative
returns of the same absolute magnitude. Two comp eting explanations have been put forth to
rationalize this phenomenon. According to the so-called leverage effect, a large negative return
increases financial and operating leverage, in turn raising equ ity return volatility (e.g., Black, 1976, and
Christie, 1982 ). Alternatively, if the market risk premium is an increa sing function of volatility, large
negative returns increase the future volatility by more than positive returns due to a volatility feedback
effect (e.g., Cam pbell and Hentsc hel, 1992). W e now re-evaluate the underlying empirical evidence on
the basis of our realized volatility measures.
5.1 Logarithmic Standard Deviations
The use of realized volatilities allows for direct tests of asymmetries in the impact of past returns.
However , in order to avoid confusing such effects w ith the strong serial correlation documented in the
previous section, it is imperative that dynamic dependence be modeled properly. The first four
columns in Table 5 report the regression estimates based on the fractionally differenced series,

(1-L)dilvi,t = T i + ( iAlvi,t-1 + N iAlvi,t-1 I(r i,t-1<0) + ui,t,

(5)

where I(A) refers to the indicator function, and the values for di are fixed at the dGPH estimates reported
in Table 4. Also, to accomm odate any additional short-run dynamics, the t-statistics are b ased on a
Newey-West robu st covariance matrix estimator using 22 lags.
The med ian estimated value of ( i equals -0.023, and only one of the thirty t-statistics for ( i is
statistically significantly greater than zero, when judged by the standard 95-percent critical value of

- 14 -

1.645.23 Simultaneously, the median estimate for N i equals 0.053, and 22 of the thirty t-statistics
exceed the five percent critical value. These results are broadly consistent with the EGARCH model
estimates for daily individual stock returns reported by Cheu ng and Ng (1992) and K im and Kon
(1994) , indicating a differential impact, or asymmetry, in the influence of past negative and positive
returns.
However , although statistically significant for most of the stocks, the e conomic importance of
this effect is marginal. Consider Figure 10, which displays the scatterplots for the logarithmic standard
deviation for AA, lvAA,t , against the lagged standardized returns, rA A , t- 1 /vAA,t-1 . For visual reference, we
have superimposed the two regression lines corresponding to negative and positive returns. This figure
provides a direct analogy to the news impact curves for parametric ARCH models previously studied
by Pagan and Schwert (1990) and Engle and Ng (1993). Although the news impact curve is more
steeply sloped to the left of the origin, the systematic effect is obviously not very strong; similar plots
for each of the 29 other stocks are available in ABDE (2000). This parallels the findings for the four
individu al stoc ks in Ta uchen, Zhang and Liu (1 996), who note that w hile asym metr y is a characteristic
of the point estimates, the magnitude is quite small. In contrast, the parametric volatility model
estimates reported in Nelson (1991), Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle (1993) and Hentschel (1995),
among others, all point tow ard im portant as ymmetries in market-w ide eq uity index returns , which calls
into question the leverage explanation and instead suggests that the s ignificant asymmetries for the
aggregate market returns reported in these studies are most likely due to a volatility feedback effect
(see also the recent discussion of Bekaert and Wu, 2000).
5.2 Correlations
As noted above, little is known about the distributions of individual stock return correlations. If the
volatility as ymmetry at the individual stock level is caused by a leverage effect, then a change in
financial leverage is likely to also affect the covariances between different stocks, which in turn may
impact the correlations. In this regard it is interesting to note that the different multivariate ARCH
mode ls estimated in K roner and N g (1998) generally result in statistically significant as ymmetries in
the conditional covariance matrices for the we ekly returns on a pair of well diversified small- and

23

Note that, as long as -( i <d i , a negative value for ( i is fully consistent with the strong volatility clusterin g effect
documen ted above, a s a series expans ion of the fractiona l differencing op erator in eq uation (5 ) would i mply tha t terms of
the form d i Alv i,t-1, ½Ad i A(1-d i )Alv i,t-2, ... also enter the right-hand-side in the corresponding equation for lv i,t .

- 15 -

large-stock portfolios.24 Similarly, Ang and Chen (2000) have recently demonstrated significant
asymmetries in the correlations between the market and various industry, size, and book-to-market
sorted portfolios. At the same time, the bivariate EGARCH models in Braun, Nelson and Sunier
(1995) indicate that while the overall market volatility responds asymmetrically to positive and
negative shocks, monthly conditional (time-varying) betas for size- and industry-sorted portfolios are
mostly symmetric. M ore recently, however, C ho and Engle (1999 ) report statistically significant
asymmetries in daily EGAR CH beta s for a small set of individual stocks, su ggesting that the apparent
symmetry in the monthly portfolio betas in Braun, Nelson and Sunier (1999) may be due to crosssectional and/or temporal aggregation effects.
In light of these findings, we now extend the analysis above to test for asymmetries in the
realized daily correlations. In particular, the last three columns in Table 5 rep ort the results from the
regressions,

(1-L)di,j Corri,j,t = T i,j + ( i,jA( lvi,t- 1 + lvj,t-1 ) + 2 i,j A( lvi, t- 1 + lvj,t-1 )AI(r i,t-1Arj,t-1>0)
(6)
+ N i,jA( lvi,t- 1 + lvj,t-1 )A I(r i,t-1<0,r j,t-1<0)} + ui,j,t ,

where, as before, the di,j are fixed at the dGPH estimates reported in Table 4, and the t-statistics are
based on a N ewey-Wes t HAC covar iance matrix estimator using 22 lags. Note that ( i,j captures the
impact of the past realized volatilities on the correlations, 2 i,j gives the additional influence when the
past returns are of the same sign, while the overall impact of the past volatility if both of the returns are
negative is measur ed by ( i,j + 2 i,j +N i,j. This particular formu lation therefore facilitates a direct test of
asymmetry based on the t-statistic for N i,j.25
Turning to the results, most of the 435 estimates for N i,j are indeed positive. However, less
than half are significant at the usual 95-percent level when judged by the tN-statistics . This relatively
weak asymm etry is underscored by Figure 11, which plots the daily realized correlations for AA and

24

In the context of international equity markets, Erb, Harvey and Viskanta (1994) and Longin and Solnik (1998) have also
argued that the cross-country correlations tend to be higher when the returns are negative.
25

Because of the fractional differencing operator on the left side of the equation, the actual coefficient values should be
carefully interpreted.

XON, CorrAA,X ON,t , against the average lagged standardized returns, ½A(rAA,t-1 /vA A , t- 1 + rXON,t-1 /vXON,t-1 ).
As with the realized volatility news impac t curve in Figure 10, the line corresponding to the sum of the
two lagged returns being negative is slightly more steeply sloped than the line corresponding to the
sum of the lagged retu rns being positive. How ever, the systema tic influence of this effect is clearly not
very important. Similar graphs obtain for all of the other stocks (see ABDE, 2000).

6. Multivariate Unconditional Volatility Distributions
Here we investigate various aspects of the multivariate unconditional volatility distributions. Many key
economic and financ ial, as well as regulatory, questions depend upon the perc eived comm onality in
volatility movements across ass ets and mar kets. Most of the existing evidence concerning the extent of
such co-movements relies on very specific parametric volatility models. The realized volatility
measures, in contrast, allow for a direct assessment of the relationship between the individual standard
deviations and correlations.
We begin in Figure 12 w ith a scatterplot of the realized daily logarithmic standard d eviation of
AA, lvAA,t , against the logarithmic standard deviation of XON, lvXO N,t . It is evident that the two
volatilities move together. This feature also holds for the other stocks. From the first colum n in Table
6, the median corre lation between lvi,t and lvj,t acros s the 4 35 unique pairw ise combina tions equals
0.205.26 As discussed further below, this tendency of return volatility to vary in tandem across
individual stocks is consistent with factor str ucture, as in Diebold and Nerlove (1989), Ta uchen and
Tauchen (1999), and others.
Next, in Figure 13 and the second column of Table 6, we document the presence of what
might be termed a volatility-in-correlation effect. In particular, in Figure 13 w e plot the average
realized daily correlations for AA, (1/29)AE i CorrAA,i ,t for i AA, against the logarithmic standard
deviation for AA, lvAA,t . As for the foreign exchange rates analyzed in ABDL (1999a), a strong
positive association is evident. This is further unders cored by the resu lts in the second colu mn in
Table 6. The median correlation between all of the individual correlations, Corri,i,t , and the
corresponding logarithmic standard deviations, lvh,t for i=h or j=h, equals 0.150. While similar

26

Embrechts, McNeil and Strauman (1999) have recently advocated the use of copulas and rank statistics when
measuring dependence in non-normally distributed financia l data. However, because t he unconditional distr ibutions that we
explore in Table 6 are all approximately Gaussian, the linear correlation affords the most natural measure in the present
context.

- 17 -

volatility-in-correlation effects have been documented for other broadly defined market indexes, our
direct model-free m easurem ents of realized correlations and volatilities are very different from the
procedures previously entertained in the literature, and as such our findings provide additional
empirical supp ort for the phenomenon. 27 As shown below, a volatility effect in correlation is also to be
expected within a factor structure, just as with the positive correlation across volatilities (see also
Ronn, Sayra k, and Tomp aidis, 1998). At the same time, the sp ecific m anifestation of the effect is
model dependent, which renders direct predictions about magnitudes impossible within our
nonparametric setting. Nonetheless, the strength of the effect is noteworthy and provides a benchmark
measure that candidate models should be able to accommodate. At the least, it suggests that standard
mean-variance efficiency calculations based on constant correlations may be misguided.
Our final look at the multivariate volatility distributions in Figure 14 s hows the scatter plot of
average realized daily correlations for AA against the average realized correlations for XON; i.e.,
(1/28)A E i CorrAA,i ,t versus (1/28)A E i CorrXO N,i,t for i

AA and i

XON. The strong association between

the realized daily correlations is truly striking. Clearly, there is a powerful comm onality in the comovements across the individual stocks. The last column of Table 6 tells the same story. The smallest
correlation among the 82,215 (=30@29@28@27/8) unique correlations is as high as 0.093, and the median
correlation between the daily time series of realized correlations equals 0.308. Again, this seems to
suggest that there is a lower dimensional factor stru cture driving the second m oment characteristics of
the joint distribution, to which we now turn.

7. Latent Factor Structure in Volatility
The notion of a low-dimensional factor structure is central to modern asset pricing theory (e.g.,
Cochrane, 200 0). W e briefly explore the properties of realized volatility in the context of a s imple
multivariate model with an explicit factor structure. We focus on three of the empirical results noted
above: the tendency for volatilities to move together, the tendency for correlations to be high when the
corresponding volatilities are high, and the tendency for an arbitrary correlation to be high when other
correlations are also high.

27

Similar observations have recently been made in the context of international equity index returns by Solnik, Boucrelle
and Le Fur (1996). This also motivates the switching ARCH model estimated by Ramchand and Susmel (1998), who argue
that the correlations between the U.S. and other world markets are on average 2 to 3.5 times higher when the U.S. market is
in a high variance state as compared to a low variance state.

Consider an N-dimensional diffusion for log price pt with the single-factor repres entation

dpt = 8 F t dWt + S dVt ,

(7)

where 8 is an N-dimensional vector of loadings on the common volatility factor F t dWt , Vt is an Ndimensional stand ard B rownian motion with mutually-ind ependent elements, and the diagonal ma trix
S contains N individual asset-specific volatilities. Note that each element of the N-vector of returns dpt

is driven in part by a single latent factor with stochastic volatility, and in part by an orthogonal
idiosyncratic noise.
Given the simple model (7), the N-dimensional vector of da ily retur ns is

rt + 1 / pt + 1 - pt = I8 F t dWt + IS dVt .

(8)

Letting E t denote the corresp onding N×N covariance matrix conditional on the sample path filtration
generated by the latent volatility process,

, the element of E t corresponding to the covariance

between the ith and jth elements of rt + 1, say { rt+1 }i and { rt+1 }j , is

{ E t }i,j / { 8 8 ' }i,j I F 2t + J dJ + S ij.

(9)

Hence, the conditional variances and covariances inherit their dynamics from Ft, a fact with important
implications for comovements among volatilities and correlations.
In order to relate this factor model directly to daily realized volatilities and correlations, it is
convenient to restate the system in discrete time. The continuous-time latent factor volatility model (7)(9) maps directly into a discrete-time model that has been stud ied by a number of author s, including
Diebold and N erlove (1989) , Harvey, Ruiz and Shephar d (1994 ), King, Sentana and Wadhwani
(1994), Fiorentini, Sentana and Shephard (1998), and Jacquier and Marcus (2000):

- 19 -

(10)

where

, and t = 1, ..., T.
It is readily established that volatilities tend to move together in such a factor model.

Concretely, the ith and jth time-t conditional variances, for arbitrary i and j, are

(11)

Note in particular that the conditional variance s, which are them selves cova riance stationary stochastic
processes , are linear functions of latent volatility

and are therefore driven entirely by movements in

volatility. The unconditional covariance betwe en

and

is

(12)

which is unambiguously positive. Hence the unconditional correlation betwee n

and

is also

unambiguously positive.
It is also readily seen why a factor structu re induces high correlations in situations of high
volatility. The ijth time-t conditional covariance is

(13)

so the conditional correlation is

.

Note the conditional variance effec t in conditional correlation: if

. Moreover,

and

, then

.

Finally, it is straightforward to verify that a factor structure implies that if the correlation
between an arbitrary pair of stocks is high, the correlations between other stocks tend to be high also.
In fact, equation (14) makes clear that, so long as all stocks load positively off the common factor, all
pairwise corre lations are increasing in volatility. Hence, as volatility moves, the pairwise cor relations
all move as well, and in the same d irection.
In closing, we note that it is easy to extend these re sults to richer factor stru ctures, including
models with dynamics in S and models w ith multiple factors, as in recent wor k by Lo and Wang
(2000) on modeling volume, which is intimately rela ted to the modeling of volatility.

8. Conclusions
We exploit direct mod el-free measu res of realized daily volatility and correlation obtained from highfrequency intraday stock prices to confirm, solidify and extend existing characteriza tions. Our findings
are remarkably consistent w ith exis ting work such as ABD L (1999a, b) and Ebens (1999a). This is
true of the right-skewed distributions of the variances and covariances, the normal distributions of the
logarithmic standard deviations and correlations, the normal distributions of daily returns standardized
by realized standard deviations, and the str ongly persistent dynamics of the realized volatilities and
correlations, well-desc ribed by a stationary fractionally integrated process and conforming to scaling
laws under temporal aggregation. The striking congruence of all findings across asset classes (equ ity
vs. for ex) a nd underlying method of price recording (transaction prices vs. avera ges of logarithmic bid
and ask quotes) suggests that the results reflect fundamental attributes of speculative returns.
Our analysis is noteworthy not only for confirming and checking robustness of existing results,
but also for achieving significant extensions, facilitated throughout by the model-free m easurem ent of
realized volatility and correlation afforded by high-frequency data, and the simplicity of our methods,
which enable straightforward high-dimensional correlation estimation. We shed new light on some
distinct properties of equity return dynamics and illustrate them, for example, via the news impact
curve. We confirm the existence of an asymmetric relation between returns and volatility, with

- 21 -

negative returns being associated with higher volatility innovations than positive returns of the same
magnitude. However, the effect is much weaker at the individual stock level than at the aggregate
market level, thus lending support to a volatility risk premium feedback exp lanation rather than a
financial leverage effect. Moreover, we find a pronounced volatility-in-correlation effect, thus limiting
the benefits of portfolio diversification when they are needed most. The strength of this relation
suggests that suboptimal decisions will result from analysis based on the premise of a constant or fixed
variance-covariance structure. F inally, the volatility-in-correlation effect, the strong positive
association between individual stock volatilities, and the corresponding strong relationship between
contemporaneou s stock correlations should m otivate additional work on the development of
parsimonious factor models for the covariance structure of stock returns.
We envision several applications of the approach adopted in this paper. For exa mple, the
direct measurement of volatilities and correlations should alleviate the errors-in-variables problem that
plagues much work on the implementation and testing of the CAPM, because realized betas may be
constructed directly from the corresponding realized covariances and sta ndard deviations. M ulti-factor
models bas ed on factor replicating portfolios are similarly amenable to direct analysis. As a s econd
example, the effective observability of volatilities and correlations facilitates direct time-series
modeling of portfolio choice and risk management problems under realistic and testable distributional
assum ptions. Work along these lines is curre ntly being pursued in Anders en, Bollerslev, Diebold and
Labys (1999d). Finally, our methods will also facilitate direct comparisons of volatility forecasts
generated by alternative models and procedures. Such explorations are underway in Ebens (1999b)
and Ebens and de Lima (1999).
