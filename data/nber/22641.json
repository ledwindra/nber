    "abstract": "\n\nSports participation is a leading environmental explanation of the male advantage in some spatial skills.  We exploit the large increase in females\u2019 high school sports participation due to Title IX to test this hypothesis. We relate Title IX induced increases in females\u2019 sport participation to the spatial content of their occupational employment as captured by Dictionary of Occupational Titles codes, and a test of three dimensional spatial rotation.  We find little evidence that this increase in sports participation had an impact on either of these measures.\n\n",
