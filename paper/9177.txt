NBER Working Paper No. 9177
September 2002
ABSTRACT
This paper provide a large-deviations approximation of the tail distribution of total financial
losses on a portfolio consisting of many positions. Applications include the total default losses on
a bank portfolio, or the total claims against an insurer. The results may be useful in allocating
exposure limits, and in allocating risk capital across different lines of business. Assuming that, for
a given total loss, the distress caused by the loss is larger if the loss occurs within a smaller time
period, we provide a large-deviations estimate of the likelihood that there will exist a sub-period of
the future planning period during which a total loss of the critical severity occurs. Under conditions,
this calculation is reduced to the calculation of the likelihood of the same sized loss over a fixed
initial time interval whose length is a property of the portfolio and the critical loss level.

Introduction

We1 provide a large-deviations approximation of the tail distribution of total
financial losses on a portfolio consisting of many positions. Applications
include the total default losses on a bank portfolio, or the total claims against
an insurer. A key assumption is that, conditional on a common “correlating”
factor Y , position losses are independent. For example, in the case of default
losses, Y could be the state of the business cycle. For the case of an insurance
portfolio, Y could include indicators of events causing multiple claims, such
as epidemics or natural catastrophes.

The results include explicit calculations, conditional on a large portfolio
loss, of the probability of loss for each position, and the distribution of the size
of the position loss. This information may be useful in allocating exposure
limits for each type of position, and in allocating risk capital across different
lines of business.
We also address the fact that, for large losses, financial distress costs are
more severe if the losses occur over a relatively short period of time. Sudden
losses may cause extreme cash-flow stress, and investors may require more
favorable terms when offering new lines of financing over short time periods,
within which they may have a limited opportunity to gather information
about the credit quality and long-term prospects of a distressed financial
institution. Our results show that, for the purpose of obtaining a largedeviations estimate of the likelihood of occurence a failure-threatening loss
during some sub-interval of time during a given planning horizon, one can
restrict attention without loss of generality to losses over a certain fixed
“key time horizon.” From this key time horizon, one can then estimate the
conditional distribution of losses on each type of position, which may be of
assistance in structuring a large portfolio so as to withstand severe losses.

Motivation

Consider, for example, an insurance company with a large portfolio of propertydamage policies, each generating a stream of premiums whose present market value exceeds the present market value of the associated uncertain future
damage claims. (This should be the case, at least at origination, for any
policy that the insurance company is willing to offer.) In perfect capital
markets, the event that total damage claims, net of premiums, exceeds the
capital of the insurance firm would trigger a recapitalization of the insurance
company, say by selling equity. The alternative of bankruptcy would entail
losing the net positive market value of the remaining policies. Losses up to
the current date are sunk costs, and therefore irrelevant to the decision to
recapitalize. Likewise, the initial level of capital would be irrelevant in perfect markets, for re-capitalization could occur at any time. In the classical
ruin-theory insurance model (for example [3, 4, 7]), however, the insurance
company with a given initial capital faces “ruin” whenever the remaining
capital, net of gains and losses, reaches zero. We depart from this classical
ruin-theory approach, as it ignores the incentive to re-capitalize at low levels
2

of capital.
While classical ruin theory unrealistically ignores re-capitalization, it correctly focusses on the importance, given the reality of imperfect capital markets, of a level of capital that is likely to withstand unexpectedly large aggregate losses. In the event of insufficient capital to cover losses, raising new
capital is, in practice, expensive. For example, in order to entice new equity
investors to offer a given amount of capital, a firm that is better informed
about its prospects than are new investors would generally need to offer investors equity whose value to the firm is worth more than the amount of
capital raised. (See, for example, [5].) In sufficiently severe cases, especially
when large unexpected losses occur over a relatively short period of time,
it may be impossible to raise enough capital to meet obligations, and the
ongoing franchise value of the firm may be severly impaired or lost.
This paper provides some analytical guidance on the dependence of largeloss probabilities on the structure of a portfolio with a large number n of
positions, and on the “most likely way” that a large loss can occur. For
example, given a large loss, we calculate, for each type of position, the conditional likelihood of loss on each type of position as well as the conditional
distribution of exposure in the event of loss. These conditional calculations
are to be interpreted in the asymptotic (large n) sense of the Gibbs conditioning principle (see, for example, [1]). For instance, suppose positions are
of two types. A given fraction, say high-quality borrowers who are granted
large amounts of credit, experience large losses with small probabilities. The
remainder, say low-quality borrowers granted less credit, experience smaller
losses with higher probabilities. We show how to estimate, under conditions,
the expected loss on a policy of each type in the event of large loss. For each
given position type, this depends on the size of the total loss considered, and
on the probability distributions of losses on all other positions.
Given the costs of raising capital in a distress scenario, this in turn leads
to an analytical estimate of the financial distress costs attributable to each
policy type, and allows for the structuring of the portfolio so as to balance the
effects of each type of policy on the total financial distress costs. For example,
we estimate the sensitivity of the large-loss probability to the fraction of the
portfolio of any given type, and to the scale of the exposure on a given type
of position. With bank portfolios, for instance, we might be interested in how
the probability that total default losses exceed a given threshold is sensitive
to the exposure limit for counterparties of a given credit rating.
These calculations could also be done by brute-force simulation, and un3

der less restrictive conditions, but the large-deviations approach offers insights that might not be apparent from mere numerical results.
After considering a static setting, we turn in Section 4 to the estimation of
the probability that, during some sub-interval of time during a given planning
horizon, there will exist financial losses that exceed a threshold, allowing for
the fact that financial distress costs are larger when losses are concentrated
over a smaller period.

Portfolio Calculations

A probability space (Ω, F , P) is fixed. For a portfolio with a finite number
n of positions, position i will, at the time of revaluation of the portfolio,
experience a loss of Zi Ui , where Zi has outcomes 0 (for no loss) and 1 (for
non-zero loss), and Ui ≥ 0 is the “exposure” (the amount that would be lost in
the event there is a loss). For example, with a loan portfolio, {Zi = 1} is the
event that i defaults and also has a non-zero exposure, and Ui is the market
value of the exposure, net of default recoveries. For the case of insurance
claims, [8] analyse assocaited statistics osure forP
fire-insurance policies.
The total loss on the portfolio is thus Ln = ni=1 Zi Ui . Our main objective is to characterize, for a given x, the loss probability P(Ln ≥ nx), and,
conditional on the event that Ln ≥ nx, the probability distributions of Ui
and Zi . These conditional distributions are relevant to the structuring of
the portfolio from the viewpoint of trading off the expected profit from each
position type against the benefits of mitigating large losses.
We suppose that a “macro-environmental” variable Y can be chosen so
that, conditional on Y , the loss variables Z1 , U1 , Z2 , U2 , . . . , Zn , Un are independent. For example, in modeling credit risk, Y could incorporate key
business-cycle or industry-performance variables. For insurance risk, Y could
incorporate the major events such as natural disasters that affect the likelihood of individual losses. For simplicity, we also suppose that, for all i,
Ui and Y are independent and that Y is discretely-valued (merely to avoid
numerical integration approximations).
We assume that a portfolio contains k types of positions, in the sense that
the distribution of {Y, Ui , Zi } is the same for any position i of a given type α.
The types are fixed. We use the notation “Uα ” to denote a generic Ui variable
of type α, and likewise use “Zα ,” and so on. We let δα (Y ) = P(Zα = 1 | Y ),
the Y -conditional loss probability for type α.
4

For bank portfolios, one may think of a “type” as a credit rating. The
common distribution of the loss within a given rating is the distribution of
exposures for that rating. For purposes of this analysis, we ignore information
that might in practice distinguish among different positions of a given rating.
In this sense, the probability distribution of Ui is intended to capture, to
some reasonable extent, the effect of variation of exposure within rating. An
alternative is to distinguish types by both rating and exposure class.

3.1

Large Deviations

In order to calculate the effect of increasing the number n of positions, we
suppose that the number of positions of type α is a fixed fraction qα > 0 of
the total number n.
For computing the probability of an unexpectedly large loss, the important object to study is the cummulant generating function L( · | Y ) defined
by

=
qα log (1 − δα (Y ) + δα (Y )Mα (s)) ,

L(s | Y ) =

(1)

α

where Mα (s) = E(esUα ) is the moment generating function for loss exposure
of type α, assumed finite for small enough s > 0. For example, we might
suppose that Uα is distributed exponentially with parameter βα , in which
case

qα log 1 − δα (Y ) + δα (Y )

(2)
βα − s

when s < s0 = minα βα , and L(s | Y ) = ∞ otherwise. One then introduces
the Legendre Fenchel transform L∗ ( · | Y ) of L( · | Y ), by
L∗ (x | Y ) = sup {sx − L(s | Y )}.
s≥0

That is, one solves for s = s(x, Y ) the equation
x = L0 (s | Y ),

(3)

5

and sets

L∗ (x | Y ) = s(x, Y )x − L(s(x, Y ) | Y ).

Let s0 (Y ) = sup{s : L(s | Y ) < ∞}. If s0 < ∞, we assume that L0 (s | Y ) is
unbounded for s ↑ s0 (for example, as is true when Uα has an exponential
distribution for each α). Under this mild regularity condition, equation (3)
has a unique positive solution s(x, Y ) provided x1 (Y ) < x < x∗ (Y ), where
x1 (Y ) = L0 (0 | Y ) =

is the maximal value of the average loss per position. For example, for the
case above of exponentially
distributed Ui , we have a unique positive solution
P
for any x > x1 (Y ) = α qα δα (Y )/βα . (Here, x∗ = ∞.) Then, the probability
of a “large” loss given Y is given by the large-deviations (LD) approximation
P(Ln > nx | Y ) = pn (Y )(1 + o(1)),

(6)

where, for x < x∗ (Y ),
∗ (s | Y

pn (Y ) = (2πns2 L00 (s))−1/2 e−nL

)

,

(7)

using for s = s(x, Y ) the solution of (3), and pn (Y ) = 0, for x > x∗ (Y ). To
adapt the derivation of such approximations in [1, Theorem 3.7.4]
pto our setting, one just shows that the distribution function of (Ln − nx)/ nL00 (s | Y )
is uniformly within o(n−1/2 ) of Φ(u) + n−1/2 (u), where Φ( · ) is the standard
Normal distribution function and 0 ( · ) is some uniformly bounded, absolutely
integrable function, such that |(u)| → 0 as |u| → ∞. Using the independence of {Zi Ui }, it is not hard to establish the latter estimate, starting from
the Berry-Esseen bound for the contribution of each fixed type α.
If x < x1 (Y ), then, for large n, we have by the law of large numbers
(LLN), that (6) holds for pn (Y ) = 1, while, obviously, P(Ln > nx | Y ) = 0 if
x > x∗ (Y ). Thus,
P(Ln > nx) = pn (1 + o(1)),

(8)

P
where pn = y P(Y = y)pn (y) is the weighted average of the above approximations, with weights given by P(Y = y).
For large n, conditioning on the the excessive loss {Ln > nx} and Y , we
have the following estimates of the conditional distribution of the losses on
each position, letting Qα denote the original law of a loss exposure Uα of
type α:
• The individual losses Zi Ui remain independent and of identical law
within each type α, although Zi and Ui themselves are not independent
(as they were, unconditionally).
• The loss probability for a position is changed to the larger value
δbα (Y ) =

δα (Y )
.
δα (Y ) + (1 − δα (Y ))/Mα (s)

(9)

• For those i of type α for which Zi = 1, the conditional law of Ui is
Mα (s)−1 exp(su) dQα (u), where s = s(x, Y ) is the solution of (3).
• For those i of type α for which Zi = 0, the conditional law of Ui is the
original law, Qα .
For example, if Ui is unconditionally exponentially distributed with parameter βα , then a position i causing a loss (Zi = 1) has a loss exposure Ui that is
conditionally exponential with parameter βα − s(x, Y ). This applies for cases
in which the environmental variable Y satisfies x > x1 (Y ), that is, where
large deviations apply. (A rigorous, precise statement of this “principle” and
its derivation, is along the lines of [1, Sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.3].) Otherwise,
that is, with x < x1 (Y ), because the mean loss exceeds x, the impact of
conditioning on {Ln > nx} causes no change in the law of Zi Ui .

Numerical Example

We illustrate with a simple numerical example that will be extended as we
later consider additional calculations.
Suppose a bank has n = 10, 000 borrowers or other forms of counterparties
of two types, high rated (α = 1) and low rated (α = 2). There are two macroenvironments, “growth” (Y has outcome g) and “recession” (Y has outcome
b). High-rated counterparties constitute half (q1 = q2 = 0.5) of the positions.

In a growth environment, the high-rated default probability is δ1 (g) = 0.001,
and the low-rated default probability is δ2 (g) = 0.004. In a recessionary
environment, we suppose that δ1 (b) = 0.0015, and δ2 (b) = 0.10. These
illustrative parameters are very roughly consistent with the data for highgrade and speculative-grade debt, as for example in [6]. We suppose that
growth occurs with probability P(Y = g) = 0.7 (so recession has probability
0.3). We will suppose that the exposures given loss are exponential with
means (in units of, say, $10,000) of 100 and 10 for high-rated and low-rated
counterparties, respectively. (That is, E(U1 ) = 100 (β1 = 0.01) and E(U2 ) =
10 (β2 = 0.1).) The LLN average loss per position is x1 (g) = 0.07 in a growth
economy and x1 (b) = 0.575 in a recessionary economy.
Figure 1 shows the large-loss probability, as a function of x > x1 (b) for
n = 10, 000, and also for a less diversified portfolio (n = 5, 000) that is
otherwise identical. Figure 3 shows how the high-rated and low-rated mean
losses, conditional (in the sense of (9)) on a large average loss x, depend on
x in the bad state (Y = b).
Because the exposures given default are exponential in this example, the

Sensitivity Analysis

We now consider the marginal impact of a change in the structure of a portfolio on large-loss probabilities. For example, in the case of a bank portfolio,
one may be interested in the impact of a change in policy toward increasing
the fraction qα of borrowers or over-the-counter (OTC) derivative counterparties of given credit rating. In practice, exposure limits are based on credit
rating (the higher the rating, the larger the allowed exposure). For example,
banks typically limit each of their OTC counterparties, based on rating, to
positions whose probability distribution of exposure given loss has a given
high (say 95%) confidence level of no more than a given number. When considering marginal adjustments in exposure limits, we will let aα be a scaling
parameter for the distribution of Uα . For example, Uα may be distributed
uniformly on the interval [0, aα ], or may be distributed exponentially with
parameter βα = 1/aα .
Recalling that pn is the LD approximation of P(Ln > nx) given by (8),

10

where Lα (s | Y ) = log E(esZαUα | Y ) is the cummulant
generating function for
P
loss in a loan of type α (so that L(s | Y ) = α qα Lα (s | Y )). The effect of
conditioning on {Ln > nx} in the weighting of the different outcomes of Y
is computed via Bayes formula using the LD approximation pn (Y ) of (7) for
P(Ln > nx | Y ). The parameter s = s(x, Y ) that solves x = L0 (s | Y ) is as
above.
In deriving the above formulas, we assume that x∗ > x > x1 (y) for
every outcome y of Y , so that the LD approximation applies in all economy
states. The derivatives above typically grow linearly with n. The extra
constants (independent of n) marked in these formulas as “O(1)” are explicit
and computable, but complicated. In general, one sets s(x, y) = 0 for those y
such that x < x1 (y), reflecting the fact that these outcomes do not affect the
linear growth of the derivatives of pn . We repeat that these formulas are not
necessarily derivatives of P(Ln > nx), but rather of the LD approximation
pn of (8).
In our illustrative example, the average position loss x that is exceeded
with an LD estimated probability of 0.001 is x = 0.7343 . The estimated
sensitivity of this large-loss probability to increasing the fraction of low-rated
counterparties is
d log pn
= pg × 15.4 + (1 − pg ) × 24.4

= 24.4,
where pg = pn (g)P(Y = g)/pn is the large-deviations estimate of P(Y =

limits of high-rated counterparties is
d log pn
= pg × 0.27 + (1 − pg ) × 0.14

= 0.14.
One can likewise estimate other sensitivities.

Time Evolution of Losses

Although the probability distribution of portfolio losses is normally measured
in practice over a fixed time interval, say one year, the ability of a financial
institution to replace lost capital (or otherwise restructure its portfolio) in
order to return to a safe condition depends on the period of time over which
the loss occurs. For example, re-capitalizing for a given large loss that occurs
over one year causes a smaller financial distress cost than would be caused by
the same-sized loss occuring over a one-week period. Rather than attempting
to treat the high-dimensional joint distribution of losses at each time horizon,
we will estimate the likelihood that there exists some sub-interval of time
over a given planning period, say one year, over which financial distress
costs exceed some critical level. For simplicity, we will suppose that financial
distress costs are proportional to the size of the loss, with a proportionality
constant that is monotone with respect to the length of the time interval
during which the loss occurs. That is, a loss of ` incurred over an interval
of time of length ∆ generates a financial distress cost of G(∆)`, for a given
non-negative, monotone non-increasing function G( · ). For tractability, we
also suppose that G( · ) is bounded and Hölder continuous.
The loss on position i occurs at a random time Ti . We let Zi (t) = 0 for
t < Ti , whereas Zi (t) = 1 for t ≥ P
Ti > 0. Consequently, the total loss on
the portfolio by time t is Ln (t) = ni=1 Zi (t)Ui . We assume that, given Y ,
the times {Ti } of loss events are independent of each other and of the loss
exposures Ui , where the distribution of Ti is the same for any position i of a
given type α. We further assume that, for each outcome y of Y and for each
type α, the distribution function Fα (t | y) = P(Tα ≤ t | Y = y) is subadditive
in t. That is, whenever 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 − ∆ ≤ 1,
Fα (t + ∆ | y) − Fα (t | y) ≤ Fα (∆ | y) .

12

(10)

This condition is satisfied whenever each loss time Ti has a monotone nonincreasing density, as for example when Tα is distributed exponentially with
parameter ηα (Y ), or uniformly. Looking at a fixed planning period, say [0, 1],
we wish to approximate

Pn (Y ) = P

for large n. With each choice of ∆ we associate δα (∆, Y ) = P(Tα ≤ ∆ | Y )
and the corresponding L(s | ∆, Y ) and x∆ (Y ), as in (1) and (4), respectively.
For example, with Ti exponential as above, δα (∆, Y ) = 1 − exp(−ηα (Y )∆).
We then have the (rough) LD approximation,

where, for x∗ > z > x∆ (Y ), we set I(z | ∆, Y ) = sL0 (s | ∆, Y )−L(s | ∆, Y ) for
the unique s = s(∆, Y ) > 0 such that L0 (s | ∆, Y ) = z, while I(z | ∆, Y ) = ∞
if z ≥ x∗ , and I(z | ∆, Y ) = 0 if z ≤ x∆ (Y ). The LD approximation (12) is
relevant when
x > sup G(∆)x∆ (Y ) ,

(13)

0≤∆≤1

while otherwise Pn (Y ) is bounded away from zero, uniformly in n. Indeed,
the lower bound on Pn is obtained by fixing t = 0 and then applying (6)
and (7) for a ∆ ∈ [0, 1] that minimizes I(x/G(∆) | ∆, Y ). The corresponding upper bound on Pn requires us to exchange in (11) the supremum over
(t, ∆) and the computation of the conditional probability. To this end, by
monotonicity of G( · ) and Ln ( · ), we upper bound Pn (Y ) while restricting
the supremum in (11) to some t and ∆ ≥ 2θ that are integer multiples of
some fixed θ > 0, provided we change there G(∆) to G(∆ − 2θ). Since G( · )
is Hölder continuous, with r > 0 sufficiently large and θ = θ(n) = n−r , we
have, for all n large enough,
sup {G(∆ − 2θ) − G(∆)} ≤ n−1 .

(In the above, the factor θ−2 which is the number of possible (t, ∆)-pairs to
consider, results from the union bound.) Applying Chebycheff’s inequality
(of the form used in deriving [1, (2.2.12)]), we see that the second term in
the above is of order O(exp(−cn log n)) for some c > 0, hence negligible.
Condition (10) implies that P(t < Ti ≤ t + ∆ | Y ) is maximal for each i at
t = 0, hence it suffices to consider only t = 0 (with Ln (0) = 0). To complete
the derivation, recall that for any z and ∆, by Chebycheff’s inequality,
P(Ln (∆) > nz − log n | Y ) ≤ ns exp(−nI(z | ∆, Y )),
with s = s(∆, Y ). (See [1, (2.2.12)] for a similar bound, but without the
− log n correction to nz.)
Fix an outcome y of Y for which (13) holds and suppose the minimum
of I(x/G(∆) | ∆, y) is obtained at a unique 0 ≤ ∆∗ ≤ 1. Set s = s(∆∗ , y) >
0 as above. Then, for large n, the “most likely way” for the effectively
excessive loss to happen is during the time interval [0, ∆∗ ] (assuming also
that in (10) we have strict inequality for ∆ = ∆∗ , for at least one type
α per t > 0). Conditional on the event A = {Ln (∆∗ )G(∆∗ ) > nx, Y =
y}, the individual losses and their times (Ui , Ti ) remain independent and of
identical law within each type α. The conditional default probability per
loan, P(Tα ≤ ∆∗ | A), is given by δbα (∆∗ , y), corresponding as with (9), to the
unconditional probability δα (∆∗ , y). The law of Ti conditional upon A and
{Ti ≤ ∆∗ } is the same as the law of Ti conditional only upon {Ti ≤ ∆∗ , Y =
y}. For i of type α, the law of Ui conditional upon A and {Ti ≤ ∆∗ } is now
Mα (s)−1 exp(su) dQα (u). In contrast, the law of (Ti , Ui ) conditional upon
A and {Ti > ∆∗ } is the same as the law of (Ti , Ui ) conditional only upon
{Ti > ∆∗ , Y = y}. (The above statements are to be understood also in form
of the “Gibbs conditioning principle” as in [1, Sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.3]).
Continuing our illustrative example, we ignore for simplicity the growth
macro-economic state (now taking P (Y = b) = 1), and suppose exponential
default arrival times, with parameters chosen so as to match the one-year
default probabilities of the original example, which is otherwise preserved.
We take the proportional financial distress cost factor to be G(∆) = e0.9(1−∆) ,
so that a given loss that occurs instantaneously generates a multiple of e0.9
of the distress cost that would be generated by the same size loss over one
year. (This is arbitrary, and merely for the purpose of a simple illustration.)
For the average position loss x that is associated with a one-year LDapproximate excess-loss probability of pn (b) = 0.001, the “key time horizon”

for purposes of analyzing large financial distress costs is ∆∗ = 0.90 years.
Defaulting high-rated positions have an associated large-loss conditional default probability over the period [0, ∆∗ ] of approximately δ̂1 (∆∗ ) = 0.0023,
compared to the unconditional default probability of 0.0014. For low-rated
positions, we have δ̂2 (∆∗ ) = 0.0945, compared to the unconditional probability of 0.0909. High-rated defaulting positions have a conditional expected
exposure of (0.01 − s(∆∗ ))−1 = 170.9, compared to the unconditional expected exposure of 100. For low-rated positions; the conditional expected
exposure is 10.4; the unconditional is 10.

respective means. For each portfolio size n, the threshold loss xn is chosen
for an estimate of 0.001 (according to pn (b)) of the large-loss probability
P(Ln > nxn ). We have in mind a range of financial institutions that have
been structured and capitalized so as to sustain a loss that would occur during
a given year with probability 0.001. We are interested in the contribution of
individual counterparties of each type to expected losses in the event of large
loss. The information in these figures shows that, with exponential distributions of loss exposures, at our base-case parameters, as one increases the size
of the portfolio beyond about n = 1100 names, the high-rated-high-exposure
counterparties cease being the greater contributors to large losses, in this
sense, and the low-rated-low-exposure counterparties become the greater expected contributors to large losses. From the viewpoint of estimated distress
losses, this information may be useful when choosing exposure limits.
