Introduction

Much of the current theory of asset pricing is based on the consumer's
first order conditions,

where

Rt+l

is the return on an asset and p is the consumer's discount factor.

This equation can-be derived from the statement that the consumer's marginal
rate of substitution between date and state contingent claims should be equal
to

the

price

ratio

of such claims.

This paper explores the

equivalent

equation for prc ucers, which can be derived from the condition that the
marginal rate of transformation between date and State contingent claims
should also equal

their

price ratio.

Its purpose

is

to

provide

an

empirically tractable framework for linking asset returns to macroeconomic
fluctuations.

There is a great deal- of evidence that such links exist: term premia in
the bond market, futures premia in the foreign exchange market,
premia in

Fig.

1 presents the log values of consumption of nondurables and services

together with gross fixed private investment and purchases of consumer
durables.

Also,

as Wilcox (1988) has recently emphasized,

the concept of

consumption in the theoretical models corresponds weakly to the quantities
used in the income and product accounts,

especially when they are seasonally

adjusted. Furthermore, deviations from optimal decision rules that are large
enough to destroy empirically useful predictions about the cyclical relation
between consumption and

asset returns can imply minute

Cochrane (1988) calculates this utility loss for a variety of models,
finds that it is typically on the order

of lc-lOC per quarter,

and

which is

interpreted to say that the predictions of the theory are sensitive to the
modelling of small (lQ-1OC/quarter) costs of
processing, transactions,

information acquisition or

etc..

This paper doesn't attempt to solve these

or other

problems with

consumption based models.

Instead it ties the important cyclical variables

such as output, investment,

etc. directly to asset prices via the producer's

Of course,

one

hopes to eventually produce an empirically tractable

general equilibrium model of asset prices and economic fluctuations, one that
includes consumer and producer first order conditions and market equilibrium,
because partial equilibrium models cannot explore the effects of fundamental
sources of uncertainty, such as changes in technology or government policy.
(Brock (1982) is an example of a prototype general equilibrium model with
production,

and the model in this paper is closely related to the production

side of Brock's model.)

However, the behavior of asset prices in general equilibrium depends on
a mixture

of preference and technological parameters, so it is hard to

understand the mapping between the structure of a general equilibrium model
and the qualitative features of the asset prices that result.

Hence,

as a

great many insights into the behavior of a complete general equilibrium model

appear from the consumer's first order conditions alone, ignoring producers,
so many insights may appear from the corresponding producer's first order
conditions,

By studying the empirical implications of

ignoring consumers.

each set of first order conditions separately before uniting them, we can
learn about preferences and technology in isolation,

and this should simplify

the task of producing empirically useful general equilibrium models.

The purpose

of this paper, like that of Mehra and Prescott's paper, is to see whether
there exist simple and approximate models with "reasonable" parameters and

phenomena, before proceeding to the construction of detailed (and hence,
unavoidably, complex) models that can be formally tested.
that there are such production-based models,

This paper finds

as Mehra and Prescott argued

that there are no such consumption based models.

A test assesses whether a model,

including its auxiliary specification

and statistical assumptions, is capable of explaining all phenomena for which
one can derive predictions. In particular,

the model presented in this paper

and Mehra and Prescott's model have implications for asset prices beyond the
first

two moments, and those implications are ignored.

In both cases,

the

models are so simple that one can derive the prices for contingent claims,
and thus one can deduce all moments of asset returns and the prices of all
derivative securities.

A literally-minded formal test of either model would

investigate whether all these

predictions are satisfied, and such a test

would certainly reject the models in sec. 3 and 4 of this paper as well as
Mehra and Prescott's model.

The exercise of both papers is a prelude to, and

test is under construction, in the form of a test whether the physical rates

second weakness is that the high forward rate term premia are associated

with a falling real term structure

and vice versa.

Subsequent evidence by

Fama (1988) suggests the opposite: high forward rate term premia correspond
to

a

rising real term structure,

inflation

correlated with even more strongly declining

forecasts.
