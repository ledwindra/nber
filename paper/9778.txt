ABSTRACT
Even well managed emerging market economies are exposed to significant external risk, the bulk
of which is financial. At a moment's notice, these economies may be required to reverse the capital
inflows that have supported the preceding boom. While capital flows crises are sudden nonlinear
events (sudden stops), their likelihood fluctuates over time. The question we address in the paper is
how should a country react to these fluctuations. Depending on the hedging possibilities the country
faces, the options range from pure self-insurance to hedging the sudden stop jump itself. In between,
there is the more likely possibility to hedge the smoother fluctuations in the likelihood of sudden
stops. The main contribution of the paper is to provide an analytically and empirically tractable
model that allows us to characterize and quantify optimal contingent liability management in a
variety of scenarios. We show, with a concrete example, that the gains from contingent liability
management can easily exceed the equivalent of cutting a country's external liabilities by 10 percent
of GDP.

Introduction

Even well managed emerging market economies are subject to an occasional “sudden stop” of net
capital inflows. That is, at a moment’s notice these economies may be required to reverse the
capital inflows that supported the preceding boom.
The deep contractions triggered by this sudden tightening of external financial constraints have
great costs for these economies, and therefore represent one of the main macroeconomic policyproblems for emerging market economies. There are many domestic and external factors behind
these sudden stops in net capital inflows. While there is substantial agreement on the kind of policy
adjustments that reduce domestic risks, there is less consensus on what are the adequate external
liability management strategies to deal with external shocks. In Caballero and Panageas (2005)
we analyzed reserves accumulation and hedging mechanisms to soften the impact of sudden stops
once these take place. In this paper we focus on a diﬀerent aspect of the problem: We argue that
there are substantial fluctuations in the likelihood of a sudden stop, and that in many instances
these fluctuations are correlated with persistent external variables which oﬀer hedging possibilities
free of moral hazard or (emerging market specific) informational concerns (see Sections 5 and 6 for
evidence).
The main technical contribution of the paper is a model that is stylized enough to allow extensive analytical characterization, but is also flexible and realistic enough to generate quantitative
guidance. The model has two central features: First is the sudden stop, which we characterize as
a probabilistic event that, once triggered, requires the country to reduce the pace of external (net)
borrowing significantly. This specification of sudden stops captures well policymakers’ concerns not
only with the stock of external liabilities but also with the size of current account deficits (a flow
variable). Second is a signal, which describes the likelihood of sudden stop at each point in time.
We characterize the impact of changes in this signal on optimal precautionary savings, and the
role of diﬀerent hedging opportunities in reducing the extent of fluctuations due to precautionary
actions and the direct cost of sudden stops.
On one extreme, if the country has no access to hedging instruments, the only tool at hand
is a sort of precautionary contraction. As external indicators of the likelihood of a sudden stop
worsen, the country slows down the pace of borrowing. Of course, in reality many countries choose

2

to ignore these signals and experience deeper contractions once sudden stops take place. Others are
excessively prudent, and tighten monetary and fiscal policy beyond what many see as reasonable.
The first of our goals in this paper is normative, and it is to take a step in the direction of oﬀering
an empirically based metric to evaluate how much prudence is reasonable.
On the other extreme is the case where the country can hedge both the (jump) sudden stop
directly and (diﬀusive) fluctuations in the price of such hedge as the signal fluctuates. In this case
the country has maximal insurance. However, since our constraint is directly on the current account
deficits, such insurance does not remove sudden stop entirely but only reduces the country’s level
of external liabilities at the onset of the sudden stop, at minimal cost. What it does do, is to
remove the need for precautionary contractions and it limits the extent of a sudden stop to a level
that removes jumps in the value of a marginal dollar at the time of the sudden stop (since the
reduction in external liabilities raises utility in the post-sudden stop stage enough to compensate
for the welfare loss from reduced consumption during the sudden stop).
In an intermediate range, is the more feasible scenario where the jump cannot be hedged but
smooth diﬀusive hedging is available. In this case the country still can remove the bulk of precautionary contractions and reduce the cost of sudden stops, but it remains exposed to the realization
of the latter. One of the quantitative contributions of the paper is to show that this type of hedging
can go a long way in reducing the overall costs of living in a sudden stop prone environment.
The case of Chile, a prudent emerging market economy, provides a useful framework of reference.
Chile’s business cycle is highly correlated with the price of copper, its main export good; so much
so that this price has become a signal of aggregate Chilean conditions to (foreign and domestic)
investors and policymakers alike. As a result of the many internal and external reactions to this
signal, the decline in Chilean economic activity when the price of copper falls sharply is many times
larger than the annuity value of the wealth eﬀect of the price decline.

This contrasts with the

scenario in Australia, a developed economy not exposed to the possibility of a sudden stop, where
similar terms-of-trade shocks are fully absorbed by the current account, with almost no impact on
domestic activity and consumption.1 Chile is a natural candidate for the type of hedging strategies
we propose.
We do not attempt to explain why international financial markets treat Chile and Australia
1

See , e.g., Caballero (2001).

3

so diﬀerently, or even why the signal for the sudden stops should be so correlated with the price
of copper. Instead, we take the “sudden stops” feature as a description of the environment and
characterize the optimal risk management strategy under diﬀerent assumptions about imperfections
in hedging markets.2
We estimate Chile’s probability of facing a sudden stop as a function of the price of copper and
calibrate the parameters to match observed consumption fluctuations. We then describe diﬀerent
hedging strategies and their impact on the volatility and levels of consumption. We start by
showing that in the absence of hedging instruments, Chile should exhibit a significant precautionary
business cycle. For example, more than half of the deep reduction in the current account deficit in
Chile during the 1998/99 crisis can be accounted for by the optimal response to the fear (not the
realization) of a sudden stop.
We then go on to show the benefit of adding contingencies to liability management. For a wide
range of scenarios the gains associated with hedging are equivalent to reducing Chile’s net external
liabilities (of about 50 percent of GDP) by a third. Similarly, we find that the required risk premia
to justify for a country like Chile to not adopt an active hedging strategy exceeds 800 basis points
for the simplest strategies and several thousand basis points for richer ones.3
Of course the benefits of these strategies are not limited to the case of Chile, which is only
illustrative. As another example, we show for a panel of emerging markets that the likelihood of
sudden stops – as identified by Calvo et al (2005)– exhibits large time variation, and that the
latter is strongly correlated with lagged US high yield spreads.
2

We focus on the aggregate financial problem vis-a-vis the rest of the world, in an environment where domestic

policy is managed optimally and decentralization is not a source of problems. Needless to say, these assumptions
seldom hold in practice. Such failures compound the problems we deal with in this paper by exacerbating the country’s
exposure to sudden stops. See, e.g., Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001, 2003) and Tirole (2002) for articles dealing
with decentralization problems. The literature on government’s excesses is very extensive. See, e.g., Burnside et al
(2003) for a recent incarnation.
3
In his Nobel lecture, Robert Merton (1998) highlights the enormous savings than can be obtained by designing
adequate derivatives and other contracting technologies to deal with risk management. He also argues that emergingmarket economies stand to gain the most. Our findings in this paper fully support his views. See also, e.g., Krugman
(1988), Froot, Scharfstein, Stein (1989), Haldane (1999), Caballero (2001), for articles advocating commodity indexation of emerging markets debt. The contribution of this paper relative to that literature is to oﬀer a quantitative
framework and to link the hedging need not to commodities per se, but to the signal aspect of much costlier financial
constraints.

4

In section 2 we describe the environment and characterize the optimization problem once a
sudden stop has been triggered – this provides the boundary conditions for the “precautioning
phase.” In section 3 we study the phase that precedes a sudden stop when the country self-insures.
The main goal of this section is to characterize precautionary contractions. Section 4 describes
aggregate hedging strategies under diﬀerent degree of imperfections in these markets. Section 5
illustrates our results through an application to the case of Chile. Along the way, we outline
an econometric approach to gauging the likelihood of a sudden stop and its correlation with an
underlying signal. Section 6 provides empirical evidence for a panel of emerging market economies
on the large time variation in the likelihood of sudden stops and its correlation with persistent (and
exogenous) global indices. Section 7 concludes and is followed by an extensive technical appendix.

2

Preliminaries

Intertemporal smoothing implies that emerging economies typically experience substantial needs for
external borrowing from abroad. For a variety of reasons that we do not model here, this dependence
on borrowing is a source of fragility. The sudden tightening of financial constraints generates large
drops in consumption. In this section we formalize such environment and characterize the value
function of consumers once a sudden stop has occurred. This serves as a boundary condition for
the pre-sudden stop problem faced by the country, which is our main concern in this paper.

2.1

Endowment and Preferences

Let the endowment grow at some constant rate, g > 0, during 0 ≤ t < ∞:
yt = y0 egt .

(1)

This specification of the income process excludes feedback eﬀects from aggregate demand to output
and from output to sudden stops (although we recover some of the latter channel in the signal
process, see below), and hence underestimate the impact of the phenomenon we study. Nonetheless
we adopt it because its simplicity allows us to isolate the direct eﬀect of sudden stops more cleanly.
Reflecting emerging markets’ net debtor position, the country starts with financial wealth,

must be positive at all times:

where r denotes the riskless interest rate and it exceeds the rate of growth of the endowment, r > g.

Let ct and c∗t represent date t consumption and “excess” consumption, respectively, with:
c∗t ≡ ct − κyt ,

0 ≤ κ < 1.

δ > 0, γ > 0.

The parameters δ and γ are the discount rate and risk aversion coeﬃcient, respectively. For
simplicity, we assume r = δ throughout. The functional form of the utility function captures an
external habit formation, with a habit level that is increasing at the rate of the country’s growth
rate. The habit term plays two roles: First, it raises the eﬀective risk aversion of the country
in a manner similar to Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and thus brings the demand for hedging
to realistic magnitudes. Second, it introduces a trend in consumption which allows us to reduce
borrowing demand to reasonable levels without introducing overlapping generations or gaps between
the interest and discount rates which would complicate the analysis.4

A frictionless benchmark
It is instructive to pause and study the solution of problem (2) subject to a standard intertemporal budget constraint (and absent a sudden stop constraint):
dXt = (rXt − c∗t + yt∗ ) dt

(3)

Accordingly, this type of utility function implies that the indebtedness of the country at any point in time will

By standard reasoning we have that in such case:

This case serves as a frictionless benchmark in what follows.
2.1.1

Sudden Stops

We place no limits on the country’s borrowing ability up to the stochastic time τ . At this time, the
country faces a “sudden stop.” We do not model the informational or contractual factors behind
this constraint, or the complex bargaining and restructuring process that follows once the sudden
stop is triggered. Since our goal is to produce a quantitative assessment of the hedging aspects of
the problem, we look for a realistic and fairly robust (across models) constraint. For this, we simply
model the sudden stop as a temporary and severe constraint on the rate of external borrowing. In
particular, since the “natural” aggregator of a country’s total wealth is the net present value of its
total resources, we place the constraint on:
Xτ +

yτ∗

r−g

We assume that at time τ , financial markets require the country to increase its total resources by

(5)

It is apparent that this constraint will be always binding because, as we showed above, at the
³
´
yt∗
unconstrained benchmark Xt + r−g
remains constant at all times. It is then straightforward to

show that this constraint can be expressed as a constraint on the maximum allowable amount of

debt/gdp at time τ + T , as a function of the debt/gdp ratio at time τ . To see this, simply rearrange
(5) to obtain
Xτ

Xτ +T

yτ∗+T

(6)

Higher levels of ζ make the constraint tighter. At its minimum, ζ = egT , the constraint literally
reduces to the requirement that debt/gdp cannot grow any further between τ and τ + T :5
Xτ +T
Xτ

yτ∗+T
yτ
Finally, it is interesting to note that one can think of (6) as a constraint on the minimum
balance-of-trade surpluses the country has to accumulate over the next T periods. To see this,
start with the intertemporal budget constraint:
Z τ +T
e−r(t−τ ) (yt∗ − c∗t ) dt = e−rT Xτ +T − Xτ
τ

and replace (6) into it, to obtain:
Z τ +T
y∗
e−r(t−τ ) (yt∗ − c∗t ) dt ≥ (ζe−gT − 1) τ e−(r−g)T − (1 − ζe−rT )Xτ .
r−g
τ
This gives us the constraint in terms of the balance-of-trade surpluses required from a country
that is faced with a sudden stop. These required surpluses rise with the country’s endowment, with
ζ, and with the level of debt at the time of the sudden stop (recall that Xτ < 0 when the country
is a net debtor).
That is, we have arrived to a flow constraint rather than to a conventional stock constraint.
This specification not only facilitates our analysis but also captures well policymakers’ concerns
with current account deficits regardless of the level of external indebtedness. In practice we observe
5

Even for the ζ = egT case the constraint we consider is binding at the time of the sudden stop. This follows from

the fact that the debt/gdp ratio is always growing for an unconstrained country as we showed above.

8

a wide array of debt-to-gdp ratios but warnings emerge quickly as soon as current account deficits
(a flow) crosses certain thresholds. There is at least one good reason for this concern with flows
above and beyond stocks: while there is always some space for stock renegotiation, financing new
flows is much harder to obtain during distress.
As we mentioned above. note that while the constraint is on the flows, stocks do matter. A
higher debt-to-gdp ratio at the outset of the sudden stop requires a larger consumption sacrifice
since debt-servicing is more expensive. This is key for our results below, as the main reason for
countries to slow down in anticipation of a sudden stop is to reduce this debt-burden cost. Note
also that as ζ goes to its upper limit erT , the eﬀectiveness of the changes in the initial stock of debt
in aﬀecting the constraint is diminished but excess consumption during the sudden stop approaches
zero, and hence the value of even small contributions to the relaxation of the constraint have great
value. If γ > 1, which we assume throughout, the latter eﬀect dominates and the incentive to
adjust debt before a sudden stop rises with ζ.

2.2

The Sudden Stop Value Function (A Boundary Condition)

We solve the optimization problem in three steps. Starting backwards, we first solve for the postcrisis period, then for the sudden-stop period, and finally for the period preceding the sudden stop.
In this section we summarize the results of the first two steps. The goal of these is to find the value
function at the time of the sudden stop, V SS (Xτ , yτ ), which we then use to find the solution of the
optimization and hedging problems before the crisis takes place. Since our concern in this paper is
with the latter phase, we assume that there is only one sudden stop, which simplifies the analysis
without sacrificing much insight.
Lemma 1 Let V SS (Xτ , yτ∗ ) denote the value function at the the time of the sudden stop and set
γ > 1. Then:
V SS (Xτ , yτ∗ ) = K V + (Xτ , yτ∗ )

(7)

where V + (Xτ , yτ∗ ) denotes the value function in the benchmark frictionless case:
³
´
µ ¶γ X + yτ∗ 1−γ
τ

V + (Xτ , yτ∗ ) =

and the constant K is

K = (1 − e−rT )γ (1 − e−rT ζ)1−γ + e−rT ζ 1−γ ,
9

(8)

such that
K = K(ζ)

with

K > 1; K 0 > 0.

(9)

We leave the proof for the appendix. Note that the value function does not depend on Xτ and
³
´
yτ∗
yτ independently, but instead it depends on the net present value of resources Xτ + r−g
. This
observation will prove convenient later on, because it will allow us to reduce the dimensionality of

the dynamic programming problem. Moreover, up to the constant K, we have arrived at a value
function that is identical to the one in the problem without sudden stops. Lastly, for γ > 1, which
we assume throughout, K > 1 and increases with ζ.6
While the particular simplicity of our formulae is due to stylized assumptions, the basic message
is more general. The model also can be understood as an approximation to a potentially more
complicated specification of constraints that result in higher marginal disutility of debt in the event
of a crisis.

3

Precautionary Contractions

Let us now address our main concern and begin to characterize the country’s problem prior to
the sudden-stop phase. If there are no hedging instruments, the country’s only mechanism for
reducing the cost of a sudden stop is to cut consumption and borrowing before the sudden stop
takes place. We show that if sudden stops are somewhat predictable, the amount of self-insurance
varies over time. This time varying precautionary savings implies that when the signal of a sudden
stop deteriorates, the country falls into a sort of “precautionary contraction.” That is, into a sharp
reduction in consumption to limit the cost of the potential sudden stop.
Let st represent a publicly observed sudden stop signal that follows a diﬀusion process:
dst = µdt + σdBt .
6

Observe that for γ > 1 the function

Z 1−γ
1−γ

is negative for all Z > 0. Thus K > 1 reflects that the constrained

value function is lower than the continuation value function for the unconstrained problem. The reason we need
γ > 1 is that the flow aspect of the constraint implies that having a higher Xτ does not relax the constraint one for
one, because the lender does not reduce its demands by the same amount during the sudden stop. When γ is below
one, this eﬀect is strong enough to discourage saving for the crisis.

10

This signal is imperfectly related to the sudden stop process. Concretely, the stochastic time τ
depends on the realization of a stochastic jump process, the intensity of which is given by
λt = exp(α0 − α1 st );

α1 ≥ 0.

We can now write the dynamic programming problem as:

and the evolution of (Xt , st , yt ) is given by:
dXt = (rXt − c∗t + yt∗ ) dt

(12)

dyt∗ = yt∗ g dt

(13)

dst = µdt + σdBt .

(14)

From the previous section we know that once the sudden stop takes place, the value function
takes the form:

(17)

for an appropriate function b(st ). The function b(st ) captures all the economics of the problem and
we study it in more detail in what follows.

3.1

Precautionary Savings

Assume first that sudden stops are totally unpredictable, α1 = 0, so that λt = exp(α0 ) = λ. Since
in this case b(s) is no longer a function of the signal s, replacing the function V in the HJB equation
yields a simple algebraic equation for b:

b captures the jump in the value function once the country enters into a sudden stop. Let us
relegate the proof of the following lemma to the appendix:
Lemma 2 Equation (18) has a unique solution in

r,b .

It is now straightforward to obtain the (excess) consumption function from the envelope theorem:
c∗t =

³

(19)

This result —combined with Lemma 2— demonstrates the presence of precautionary savings: b is
larger than 1r , yet smaller than b. Hence consumption is less than what it would be in the absence
of sudden stops. Yet, it is more than what it would be if the country experienced a sudden stop.
This reflects the country’s desire to accumulate extra savings (compared to the no-sudden stop
case) in order to smooth out the eﬀects of these extreme events.
By time-diﬀerentiating (19) and using (1), (3), and (18) we obtain the country’s (excess)
consumption process:

That is, the (excess) consumption process prior to a sudden stop has an upward drift: This in
turn reflects a precautionary savings demand attributable to the uncertainty generated by the risk
of a sudden stop taking place in the next instant. But, because this probability is not correlated
with the signal s, there are no precautionary contractions. In this case, the pattern of saving for
self-insurance is not a source of business cycles.

12

3.2

Time Varying Precautionary Savings

Let us now return to the general case, where α1 > 0. After a few simplifications, substituting
the function V of equation (17) into the HJB equation (15) shows that b(s) satisfies the following
ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE):

The boundary conditions reflect the facts that as the signal becomes extremely positive, the
problem approximates the frictionless (no sudden stops) benchmark, while when the signal is extremely negative, the problem converges to that at the sudden stop time. Let
b∗ = lim b(s).

(21)

b∗ = lim b(s).

(22)

s→∞

s→−∞

where b∗ and b∗ are given by:
b∗ =

1
r

1
b∗ = K 1/γ .
r
We can easily obtain the solution to the ordinary diﬀerential equation (20) numerically. We
plot this function (multiplied by r) in the top subplot of Figure 1. The function b(s) is decreasing
with respect to s. As the signal deteriorates, this function rises rapidly, reflecting the increasing
marginal value of wealth when a sudden stop is likely in the near future.
This setup allows for an explicit characterization of the optimal consumption policy in feedback
form. Given the value function, it follows from (16) that the optimal consumption policy takes the
form:
c∗t =

³
Xt +

yt∗
r−g

b(st )

´

.

(23)

The eﬀect of the signal can be seen clearly in this expression. As s rises, b(s) falls toward
its frictionless limit and hence consumption increases for any given level of wealth. Conversely,
when the signal worsens, consumption falls for any given level of wealth causing a precautionary
contraction.

deteriorating signal increases the need to accumulate resources and accordingly makes consumption
respond more to a one-standard-deviation increase in the signal by a factor of − bbs σ. There is
also an extra precautionary savings term in the drift in response to the additional uncertainty in
consumption created by precautionary contractions. In the application section of the paper we
quantify these eﬀects.

3.3

Ignoring time varying hazards

Before we turn to hedging, we shall develop a framework to measure the costs associated with
simply ignoring time-variation in the hazard rate. In order to quantify these costs, assume that
a country chose to ignore time variation in the hazard rate and determines its policies as if the
hazard rate was given by a constant λ. In that case, the country’s “optimal” policy would be given
by:
c∗ =

³
Xt +

yt∗
r−g

´

d
where d would be a solution to equation (18) with λ replacing λ. If the hazard rate is truly time
varying, this policy will be clearly suboptimal. We can evaluate the expected utility V sub associated
with this suboptimal policy by plugging it (instead of the optimal policy (23)) into the Bellman
equation (15). This results in the partial diﬀerential equation:
´

An informed guess about the solution to this equation is:

Aggregate Hedging

Precautionary savings and contractions are costly and imperfect self-insurance mechanisms for
smoothing the impact of a sudden stop. In this section we enlarge the options of the country and
allow it to hedge using insurance contracts and derivatives. Of course, the eﬀectiveness of the
hedging strategy depends on the contracts and instruments that are available to the country, and
how accurate the crisis-signal is. In this section we provide a framework to explore a variety of
scenarios in a unified framework.

4.1

A unified model of hedging

There are two fundamental sources of risk in our framework. The first type are risks that are
associated with variations in the signal s. Since s follows a diﬀusion process, we shall refer to those
as “diﬀusive” risks. The second source of risks are those that are associated with the actual arrival
of the random sudden stop time τ . We shall refer to this type of risk as “jump” risk. The ability
of the country to mitigate the eﬀects of sudden stops will critically depend on both the availability
of markets to hedge against these risks and the costs of such strategies.
Let us assume that diﬀusive risks can be hedged in futures market. That is, a country can enter
into contracts with payoﬀs given by:
dFt
= φ1 dt + σdBt
Ft
where φ1 is a risk premium, that could depend on st . If the diﬀusive risks are not associated with
global risks, then φ1 = 0 and the futures price is a martingale. In the presence of futures contracts,
16

the dynamic budget constraint becomes:
dXt = (rXt − c∗t + yt∗ )dt + π t dFt
where π t denotes the number of futures contracts that the country wishes to purchase. Defining
the portfolio process as pt = π t Ft , we obtain the new dynamic budget constraint:
dXt = (rXt − c∗t + yt∗ + pt φ1 )dt + pt σdBt

(26)

Let us assume that jump risks are hedged through “insurers” who are willing to enter into an
(instantaneous) contract of duration dt in the following terms: If the country enters into a sudden
stop over the next interval dt, then the insurer pays 1 unit of consumption to the country, else
nothing. In exchange for this contract the country pays an amount equal to λ(st )(1 + φ2 )dt to the
insurer per contract purchased. Similar to φ1 , the parameter φ2 should be viewed as a markup
or a risk premium. If insurance is actuarially fair, then φ2 = 0. Else the insurer charges φ2 > 0.
Allowing for markets in both diﬀusive and jump risks, the evolution of assets becomes:
dXt = (rXt − c∗t + yt∗ + pt φ1 − λ(st )(1 + φ2 )It )dt + pt σdBt + It dNt

(27)

where Nt is identically equal to 0 and jumps to 1 when the country enters into a sudden stop, and
It denotes the amount of insurance contracts purchased (in units of the numeraire). The dynamic
budget constraint (27) includes equations (26) and (3) as special cases. If we assume away the
presence of insurers, then It = 0 and (27) reduces to (26). Furthermore, if we assume away the
presence of futures markets to hedge against diﬀusive risk, then (26) becomes (3).

4.2

The general case

Let us solve the country’s problem subject to the dynamic budget constraint (27), and then turn to
study important subcases. If the budget constraint is modified to (27), then the Bellman equation
for the country becomes:

(30)
(31)

The first optimality condition is the familiar Euler equation. The second equation captures
the country’s attempt to equate the marginal value of a dollar pre- and post- sudden stop, which
is fully accomplished if φ2 = 0. Finally, the last condition is identical to Merton’s formula. The
optimal portfolio of futures consists of two parts: The first part is positive (since VXX < 0, VX > 0)
and captures the willingness to accept some volatility in return for a risk-premium. By contrast, a
simple intuitive argument shows that the second term captures a hedging demand and is negative.
The reason is that the marginal value of wealth will become higher the more likely it becomes
that a sudden stop is imminent. This happens as s decreases and hence VXs < 0. A particularly
interesting case is φ1 = 0, i.e. when the signal is uncorrelated with the world economy. Then p < 0,
since only the hedging motive prevails.
To solve (28) we proceed as in Section 3 and conjecture that the value function has a separable
form:

Equation (36) is a non-linear second order diﬀerential equation which is to be solved under
the boundary conditions (21) and (22). Even though it does not have an analytical solution, we
can still characterize several properties of the solution. Of particular interest is the behavior of
consumption, for which we have:

Let us now analyze a few special cases to understand the diﬀerent component of the consumption
process.

4.3

No restrictions on hedging

The natural starting point is when φ1 = φ2 = 0. In other words, markets exist for both types of
risks and the risks that threaten the country are diversifiable. The following Lemma shows that in
this case pre-sudden stop consumption will be constant:
Proposition 1 If φ1 = φ2 = 0, then
dc∗t = 0, 0 ≤ t < τ .
This result asserts that consumption will be constant prior to a sudden stop if a country can
hedge perfectly in markets for both diﬀusive and jump risks. This result is hardly surprising. If the
country can costlessly trade in contingent claims, then it will be able to stabilize its consumption
stream pre-sudden stop. Precautionary savings ceases to be necessary as a mitigation mechanism.
19

Let us pause and note that both markets need to be costelessly accessible in order to obtain
the above result. This may seem surprising at first. Why should there be a need for a market
for diﬀusive risks as long as the country can costelessly contract with insurers on the amounts it
desires upon the arrival of the sudden stop? After all, variations in s are only useful in predicting
the likelihood of a jump, and are otherwise useless. The resolution of this puzzle is that the
cost of insurance is time varying. Since the contracts with the insurers are instantaneous, there
is uncertainty about the terms under which these contracts can be rolled over in the future. If
s decreases, then the actuarially fair insurance will become more costly. Therefore, futures are
needed in order to hedge against such variations in the price of insurance.
To see this, let us momentarily set φ2 = 0, but
φ1 = −γσ 2

ds
d

In the appendix we show that in this case the (excess) consumption process has the following
properties:

Proposition 2 Assume that φ2 = 0 and φ1 = −γσ 2 dds . Then

for d(st ) that solves (36) with φ2 = 0 and φ1 = −γσ 2 dds .
That is, the consumption process is a non-degenarate diﬀusion (in the sense that it has a nonzero “dBt00 term). This shows that in the presence of time variation in the likelihood of a sudden
stop both markets (for diﬀusive and jump risk) will contribute towards hedging. Neither will be
suﬃcient in isolation.
Let us not return to the case with φ1 = φ2 = 0. An alternative way to arrive at Proposition 1
is to use the martingale methods developed by Cox and Huang (1989) and Karatzas et.al. (1987).
This methodology is particularly attractive when dynamic trading allows one to span all possible
stochastic payoﬀs.

20

There are at least two observations that deserve comment. First, observe that the (excess)

of Proposition 1. Second, observe that the optimal level of financial wealth at time τ can be

It is interesting to cross-check that dynamic programming and the martingale methods produce the same answer

for the consumption process. To see this note that the martingale methods in conjunction with (33) imply that d(st )
is given by :
d(st ) =

The reason is intuitive: Even when all hedging possibilities are unconstrained, the country still has
to pay for such insurance, and hence it will have to cut back consumption somewhat in order to
be able to finance this insurance. However, this insurance will allow the country to eliminate the
volatility of its consumption process subsequently. An interesting feature of (42) is that it allows
us to determine the cost of “hedging” as a percentage of excess consumption. That cost is given as

This formula allows a simple “back of the envelope” computation. Note that Ee−r(τ −t) is the
moment generating function of the random time τ . Accordingly:
Ee−r(τ −t) = 1 − rE(τ − t) + O(r2 )
Ignoring the last term in the above equation, the cost of insurance as a percentage of excess
consumption is given approximately as:
´
³ 1
K γ − 1 (1 − rE(τ − t))

(43)

This formula is quite intuitive. It says that the cost of hedging is proportional to the severity of the sudden stop (as captured by K 1/γ ) and the constant of proportionality is given by
(1 − rE(τ − t)) . Hence, the longer is the expected distance to the sudden stop (say because s is
high) the less is the cost of insurance.
To see that dynamic programming will produce the same answer, note that according to the Bellman equation (36)

4.4

Restricted insurance

One could reasonably argue that the hedging of jump risks may be infeasible in practice. Insuring
sudden stops directly probably requires to overcome a long list of moral hazard and informational
concerns. One possibility is to do proxy-hedging using exogenous variables, as described by Caballero and Panageas (2005), but there will always be an important residual that probably can only
be insured (and to a limited amount) by international financial institutions rather than by private
markets.
However, if one can find tradeable variables (such as the price of copper) that are useful in predicting the arrival of a sudden stop, then hedging “diﬀusive” risk alone can still provide significant
benefits.
The easiest way to see this is to impose the constraint I = 0, but continue to maintain the
assumption that φ1 = 0. Let us enforce the constraint I = 0 by assuming that φ2 satisfies:
φ2 =

K
−1
(rd)γ

(44)

If φ2 is given by this process, then clearly I = 0 by (34). It is most useful to think of φ2 not as a
risk premium but as the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint I = 0. The following
result shows that even in this case the consumption process is less volatile than in Section 3.
Proposition 3 Assume that φ2 is given by (44) so that I = 0. Furthermore assume that φ1 = 0.
Then the optimal consumption process is given by:
(Ã
)
!γ
K 1/γ
1
dc∗
= λ(st )
− 1 dt
c∗
γ
rd
where d solves (36) with φ2 given by (44) and φ1 = 0.
A key observation about the above proposition is that the consumption process has no quadratic
variation. This is in contrast to Section 3 where we allowed precautionary savings only (compare
with equation (37)). This means that hedging with futures achieves the goal of mitigating precautionary contractions, even in the complete absence of markets that insure against the arrival of
sudden stops (jump risk).
Note, however, that relative to the φ2 = 0 case, the consumption process still has a drift reflecting the presence of precautionary savings due to the presence of unhedged jump risk. Moreover,
23

there is still (smooth) variation in the consumption rate pre-sudden stop since both λ and d depend
on st .

4.5

Pure Precautionary savings as a special case

In the previous section we postulated equation (44) for φ2 in order to impose the constraint I = 0.
In this section we shall additionally postulate that p = 0, so that the country is excluded from
hedging possibilities altogether. From equation (35) we set p = 0 by setting:
φ1 = −γσ 2

ds
d

(45)

That is, φ1 is the appropriate “shadow” risk premium that ensures that p = 0 throughout. The
next proposition shows that under the joint assumptions (44) and (45) we recover the result in
section 3.2 .

Proposition 4 Assume that (44) and (45) hold. Then d(st ) solves the same equation as b(st ) in
section 3.2 and the consumption process is given by

which is identical to equation (24).
The value of this proposition is to embed the results in Section 3 in the same framework as the
one that we used in this section and, more importantly, to identify the necessary assumptions on
“shadow” risk premia in order to justify no hedging.

4.6

Discussion

We can now view the results that we have obtained thus far in a unified framework. In Section 3 we
eliminated every hedging possibility. Therefore, the country was left with precautionary savings as
its sole protection against sudden stops. The country’s consumption pre-sudden stop was aﬀected
by both variations in the hazard rate (diﬀusive risk) and the random arrival of the sudden stop
conditional on the hazard rate (jump risk). At the polar opposite, Section 4.3 allowed for the
24

presence of an insurer and a market to hedge against diﬀusive risk. This helped eliminate the
eﬀects of both sources of risk on consumption. Hence consumption pre-sudden stop was constant.
Subsection 4.4 helped demonstrate that even in the absence of an insurer, the presence of hedging
markets can help eliminate the eﬀects of diﬀusive risk on consumption. However, the consumption
process will still be aﬀected by the non-insurability of jump risk which leaves a random drift in the
consumption process.
Importantly, Sections 4.4 and 4.5 helped to demonstrate that the assumptions on the presence or
absence of markets are equivalent to making appropriate assumptions on the prevailing “shadow”
risk premia on these markets. This will facilitate robustness checks after we calculate optimal
hedging strategies.

5

An Illustration: The Case of Chile

In this section we illustrate our main results through an application to the case of Chile. This is a
good case study since Chile is an open economy, with most of its recent business cycle attributable
to capital flows’ volatility. Moreover, the price of copper (its main export) is not only an important
source of income fluctuations but, more importantly for us, it is an excellent indicator of investors
attitude toward Chile. In fact, Caballero (2001) shows that the typical contraction in Chilean
aggregate demand and net capital flows after a sharp decline in the price of copper is many times
larger than the corresponding annuity value of the decline in Chilean wealth due to the drop in
copper prices.

5.1

Calibration

While our purpose here is only illustrative, and hence our search for parameters is rather informal,
we spend some time describing our estimation/calibration of the key function λ(s).
5.1.1

Estimating λ(s)

Sudden stops are severe but rare events, which makes it hard to estimate λ(s) with any precision.
However, we still highlight our procedure because it provides a good starting point for an actual
implementation. Similarly, a key issue is determining the components of the signal, s. Given
25

the limited goal of this section, we use only the logarithm of the price of copper. In a true
implementation it also would be worth including some global risk-financial indicator, such as the
U.S. high yield spread, the EMBI+ or the VIX (see Section 6 below), and removing slow moving
trends from the price of copper.8
With these caveats behind us, let us describe the reduced-form Markov regime switching model
we use to estimate λ(s). Unlike the standard regime-switching model, ours has time-varying transition probabilities. Our left-hand side variable is aggregate demand, Yt (which we will proxy with
GDP data but it does not make any diﬀerence for our purpose of identifying the likelihood of a
sudden stop at each point in time) and is generated by the process:
Yt = µ0 + 1{zt =1} µ1 + σ zt ε, ε ∼ N (0, 1), µ1 < 0.
The growth rate of Yt depends on an unobserved regime zt that takes values 0 and 1. When the
value of the regime is 0, the regime is “normal” and growth is just a normal variable with mean µ0
and variance σ 20 . Otherwise, the regime is “abnormal” and growth has a lower mean, µ0 + µ1 , and
a variance σ 21 . The transition matrix between the two states is assumed to be the following:
Pr(zt+1 = 0|zt = 0, Xs,s∈(t,t+1) ) = exp−

U t+1
t

λ(xu )du

= p00 Pr(zt+1 = 1|zt = 0, Xs,s∈(t,t+1) ) = p01

Pr(zt+1 = 0|zt = 1, Xs,s∈(t,t+1) ) = p10

Pr(zt+1 = 1|zt = 1, Xs,s∈(t,t+1) ) = q

where p01 = 1 − p00 , p10 = 1 − q, and Xt stands for the regressors that enter the hazard function
(the logarithm of the price of copper in this application).9 For the purpose of estimating λ(s), we
use annual GDP data starting from 1976 to 1999 and monthly copper data for the same period
(source, International Financial Statistics).10
8

Removing the slow moving trend not only seems to improve the fit but also is a key ingredient in designing

long run insurance and hedging contracts. Few investors/insurers are likely to be willing to hold long-term risk on a
variable that may turn out to be non-stationary.

Strictly speaking the quantity exp−

is unobservable, since we cannot observe the continuous path of

There is a caveat here. Our extended-sample starts from 1972, but all the years up to 1976 are part of a deep

26

For estimation, we use a Bayesian approach that is suitable for the very few datapoints that
we have. Bayesian inference seems natural in this context, since it allows exact statements that
do not require asymptotic justification. To estimate the parameters of interest (namely (α0 , α1 ))
we use a multimove Gibbs Sampler as described in Kim and Nelson (1998,1999) and is based on
the filtering algorithm of Hamilton (1989). For details we refer the reader to these references. The
basic idea is to augment the parameter set by treating the unobserved states as parameters. Then
we fix a draw from the posterior distribution of (µ0 , µ1 , σ 0 , σ 1 , q, α0 , α1 ) and conditional on these
parameters we draw from the posterior distribution of the states in a single step as described in
Kim and Nelson (1999). Given the draw from the posterior distribution of the states we sample
the conditional means µ0 , µ1 using a conjugate normal / truncated normal prior which leads to
a normal / truncated normal posterior.11 Conditional on the states and the draw from (µ0 , µ1 )
se sample from the posterior distribution of (σ 0 , σ 1 ) using inverse gamma priors which lead to
posteriors in the same class. Similarly, fixing the states and the draw from (µ0 , µ1 , σ 0 , σ 1 ) we draw
q using a conjugate beta prior leading to conjugate beta posterior.

The sampling of (α0 , α1 )

presents the diﬃculty that there does not seem to be a natural conjugate prior to use and thus
we use a Metropolis Hastings-Random walk-accept-reject step where we sample from a bivariate
normal centered at the previous iterations’ estimate as described in Robert and Casella (1999).
This provides us with a new draw form (µ0 , µ1 , σ 0 , σ 1 , q, α0 , α1 ) and conditional on this new draw
we can iterate the algorithm by filtering the states again, based on the new draw etc. It is then a
standard result in Bayesian computation that the stationary distribution of the parameters sampled
with these procedure (treating the unobserved states as parameters too) coincides with the posterior
distribution of the parameters.12
contraction due to political turmoil combined with extremely weak external conditions. However, since the extendedsample starts during abnormal years these do not influence the estimation of λ(s) (which is estimated from the
transitions from normal to abnormal states). It is in this sense that the sample relevant for the estimation of the
latter starts in 1976. For details see below.
11
For details see Albert and Chib (1993).
12
To reduce computational time and satisfy the technical conditions required for the applicability of the Gibbs
Sampler, we used proper priors for (µ0 , µ1 ) and (α0 , α1 ) and improper priors for the rest of the parameters. The
proper prior for (µ0 , µ1 ) was Normal / Truncated normal with means (0,0) and a diagonal covariance matrix. The
standard deviations where chosen to be roughly 5 times the range of the sample, so that the priors had eﬀectively no
influence on the estimation. Similarly for (α0 , α1 ) we used independent normal priors centered at 0 with a standard

27

A first output of this procedure is Figure 2 which plots the probability of being in an abnormal
state.The model recognizes roughly three years out of the 24 as abnormal years: the early 1980s
and the recent episode following the Asian/Russian crises. The early 1980s episode corresponds to
a devastating debt-crisis, and was significantly more severe than the recent one. In fact, the recent
episode appears to be a mix of a milder sudden stop and a precautionary recession.
An interesting observation about these probabilities is that they allow us to identify the abnormal regimes with great confidence. To improve the tightness of the posterior confidence intervals
concerning the parameters of interest (α0 , α1 ) we observe that conditional on the states the (log-)
likelihood function becomes:
X

zi =0

[χi log(p00 (α0 , α1 )) + (1 − χi ) log(p01 (α0 , α1 ))]

where χi takes the value 1 if there is no transition to state 1, and takes the value 0 otherwise. It is
interesting to notice that the likelihood for (α0 , α1 ) depends on the data only through the filtered
states. In other words all other parameters of the model including the GDP-data are relevant for
our purpose of estimating (α0 , α1 ) only to the extent that they influence the identification of the
states. In other words if we were to condition directly on the states we would be able to get rid of
the noise introduced by filtering.
Given the few data points and the quite clear identification of the abnormal states we report
directly the posterior distribution of (α0 , α1 ) conditional on the early 80’s and 1999 being the
abnormal states. we report the posterior distributions of the parameters (α0 , α1 ) conditional on
the states that are identified as abnormal.13 Table 1 reports these results.
Correspondingly, in what follows we use α0 = 2.5, α1 = 5.2 as our benchmark values for the
function λ(s).

but computational time was significantly increased, because convergence was significantly slower. Most importantly
though, for the results that we report in Table 1 and that we use in the calibration exercise we used completely flat
priors.

I.e., states that have a posterior probability of being abnormal above 0.75. The conditioning is done in order to
increase the precision of the estimates and seems to be warranted just by a visual inspection of Figure 2.

Other parameters

We calibrate ζ and T to generate the average cumulative consumption drop caused by the sudden
stops in the sample, which is about 8-10% of GDP. One such configuration is T = 1 and ζ =
egT + 0.35(erT − egT ).
The parameters κ and γ are calibrated to generate reasonable amounts of steady-state debt
(and hence reasonable amounts of insurance needs) together with significant precautionary fluctuations (see below, in particular, to explain much –but not all– of the precautionary contraction
experienced by Chile at the early stages of the 1998-9 episode). For this, we set κ = 0.8 and γ = 7.
The interest rate r is set to 0.09 to capture the high cost of borrowing faced by the typical
emerging market and the growth rate g is set to 0.03. The latter is a constant-rate approximation
to a path that grows significantly faster than that level for a few years, while the country is catching
up, and then decelerates below that level forever. We normalize initial GDP (y0 ) to 1, and set the
initial debt-to-GDP ratio to 0.5 (i.e., X0 = −0.5).
Finally, we approximate the process for copper by a driftless Brownian motion with constant
volatility σ, which we estimate using monthly data from 1972 to 1999 (source, IFS). We find a
value of roughly σ = 0.23 and normalize the initial value of s to 0.

5.2

Aggregate Hedging

Given these parameters, we now turn to a quantitative evaluation of the eﬀectiveness of the various
strategies described in Sections 3.2 and 4.
5.2.1

Precautionary Savings and Hedging

Let us illustrate the impact of the diﬀerent hedging strategies in steps: In the first one we illustrate
the gains from going from a pure precautionary savings strategy to one that incorporates diﬀusion
risk hedging. In the second one we enrich the strategy further by adding jump risk hedging.
We start by drawing a random path for st , plotted in panel (a) of Figure 3. The path runs for
8 years and no sudden stop takes place in it. The main features of this path are not too diﬀerent
from the realization of the price of copper during the 1990s. In particular, the large rise in s near
the middle of the path followed by a sharp decline toward the end of the period is reminiscent of

30

the path of the price of copper in the second half of the 1990s. The path starts at s0 = 0, which
corresponds to the empirical mean of st in the data.
The two lines in subplot (b) illustrate the corresponding paths of (excess) consumption generated
for the precautionary savings only case (dashed line) and the diﬀusive risk hedging case (solid line).
The former tracks the signal closely while the latter manages to avoid precautionary contractions.
Note, however, that both paths have positive slope, reflecting precautionary savings against the
jump risk (both) and precautionary contractions risk (the case without diﬀusion hedging) .
Subplot (c) shows the the paths of the currents account deficits do not diﬀer much in both
scenarios. In both cases the current account deficit is “procyclical,” in the sense that as the signal
worsens the current account deficit shrinks. Of course, in our context income does not change
with the signal but the point we are isolating is the sensitivity of consumption to news signifying
a tightening of credit conditions. The analysis would not be changed in any substantive way
by adding some correlation between such news and income shocks. We chose to keep income a
deterministic process, in order to illustrate in the simplest possible way that variations in the price
of exported commodities can have an eﬀect above and beyond their direct income eﬀect (which we
have eﬀectively “normalized” to 0 for simplicity), as long as they are useful in predicting the arrival
of sudden stops.
Importantly, the procyclical behavior of the current account deficit does not reflect the same
behavior of consumption in the two scenarios.
In the absence of diﬀusion risk hedging, it is consumption that does the adjustment. Chile is
a point in case: When the price of copper collapsed at the end of the 1990s, Chile reduced rather
than increased its current account deficit — exactly the opposite behavior of that of Australia, a
developed economy which was facing similar terms of trade shocks.14 Moreover, the sharp decline
in the current account deficit from 6 to about 3.5 percent of GDP toward the end of the sample,
suggests that about half of the current account adjustment observed in Chile during the 1998-9
crisis can be accounted by optimal precautionary behavior in the absence of hedging.15
While the current account does follow a similar path when diﬀusive risk is hedged, the adjust14
15

See Caballero, Cowan and Kearns (2005).
The rest of the adjustment could be accounted for by excess adjustment (some have argued that the central bank

contracted monetary policy excessively during this episode) and by the partial sudden stop itself (the “sovereign”
spread tripled during this episode).

1 and κ = 0.8. The solid line depicts the path of excess consumption when the country uses diﬀusive hedging.
The dashed line depicts the path of excess consumption when the country uses exclusively precautionary
savings exclusively. Subplot (c) plots the current account rXt − c∗t + yt∗ for the same two scenarios. Subplot

32

ment variable is not consumption but the net asset position. To see this note that the current
account is given by:
CAt = rXt − c∗t + yt∗
If this quantity remains practically unchanged across the two scenarios, it means that the
behavior of rXt − c∗t is roughly similar across them. However, as we have seen already, the volatility
of c∗ is dramatically diﬀerent across the two alternatives. This must mean that the net asset position
Xt has to become more volatile as we move from the precautionary savings case to diﬀusive hedging.
Subplot (d) confirms this conjecture. In the absence of hedging, the country’s net asset position Xt
is smooth, while it fluctuates when the country is hedging. As the state variable deteriorates, the
debt to GDP ratio improves under hedging. Hence the increased volatility of the net asset position
is just a natural consequence of what hedging is meant to achieve in the first place: Namely, to
transfer resources between states of the world where they are less needed to states of the world
where they are needed the most. As we increase hedging, a substantial portion of consumption
volatility is “absorbed” by the procyclical variability of the net asset position.
Let us now turn to the second step and add the possibility of jump risk hedging. As we showed in
Section 4, with full hedging possibilities excess consumption becomes constant prior to the sudden
stop. This means that the country insulates itself from the sudden stop signal – it uses jump risk
hedging to reduce the decline in consumption at the sudden stop, and diﬀusive hedging to oﬀset
fluctuations in the price of jump risk hedging as the signal changes. The top left subplot in Figure
4 reproduces the signal path in the previous figure, while the top right subplot illustrates the paths
of the country’s net foreign liabilities: The solid line shows the path of debt/gdp which fluctuates
with the signal as the price of jump-risk insurance fluctuates. The important concept, however,
is the dashed line which corresponds to the debt/gdp ratio the country will have if a sudden stop
takes place. That it is, it includes the return from the jump-risk hedges. This dashed line is smooth
and trending as the frictionless model would.
The bottom plots show the gains from jump risk hedging over and above diﬀusive hedging at
the time of the sudden stop. To generate these panels we ran 500 simulations for ten years, and
kept only those that yielded a sudden stop during that interval. The left panel shows the histogram
of diﬀerence in consumption levels at the time of the sudden stop between the full hedging case
and the diﬀusive-hedging only case. The right panel does the same for the consumption drops at
33

the time of the sudden stop. Both panels have the common message that the possibility of jump
risk hedging can significantly improve the outcome during a sudden stop.
5.2.2

Welfare calculations

We now summarize the diﬀerent gains by evaluating the value functions of a country under diﬀerent
hedging scenarios. For this, let V H and V HH denote the value function of a country that has access
to markets for diﬀusive risk only and to diﬀusive and jump risk, respectively. As a benchmark, V
denotes the value function of a country that only accumulates savings without accessing hedging
markets of any kind.

We now ask the question: How much resources would be required to

compensate a country for its lack of access to hedging possibilities? Formally, when contrasting
with the diﬀusive risk hedging only scenario, we solve for the amount W such that:
V H (st , Xt , yt∗ ) = V (st , Xt + W, yt∗ )

(46)

We do the same for other scenarios as well (with V HH instead of V H , and so on) . It will be useful
to define:
w=

W
y∗
Xt + r−g

(47)

Then, using (17), (32), the definition of w and (46) yields:
dγ = (1 + w)bγ

(48)

where b solves the diﬀerential equation (20) and d is determined as in sections 4.4 or 4.3 depending
on whether we want to allow jump risk hedging or not. Finally equation (48) leads to
µ ¶γ
d
−1
w=
b
from which we can determine W by using (47).
Figure 5 presents W (normalized by gdp), when the country is allowed to hedge diﬀusive risks
only, both diﬀusive and jump risks and when it is only allowed to accumulate precautionary savings.
(Clearly in the third case the welfare gain is zero by construction) Finally we also report the welfare
loss when the country ignores predictability altogether, as we described in section 3.3 and hence
adopts suboptimal precautionary savings.16

To determine the constant hazard λ, we ran a simulation to determine the probability that the country enters

Figure 4: The top left subplot is identical to the top left plot of figure 3. It depicts the path of the signal
normalized by its yearly standard deviation. The top right subplot depicts debt to GDP as a function of
time. The various lines capture the level of debt to GDP assuming the country were to go into a sudden
stop at time t. The bottom left figure depicts results from a simulation. Conditional on s0 = 0, we draw
500 paths for a duration of 10 years. Keeping those paths where the country enters in to a SS within 10
years the bottom left subplot shows the diﬀerences in the level of consumption at the time of the sudden
stop between the perfect hedging scenario and the diﬀusive hedging scenario. Similarly, the bottom right
figure shows the diﬀerences in consumption drop upon entering the sudden stop between the two scenarios.

35

The figure shows that for a range of values of s corresponding to the range of the (log) price
of copper in our sample, the gains from hedging are substantial. Using hedging in place of precautionary savings typically results in values of W between 8 and 10% of GDP, if only “diﬀusive”
hedging is used and are potentially up to 18% when both “jump” and “diﬀusive” hedging is used.
To put this in perspective, notice that the debt/gdp ratio for the country under consideration is
50%. This implies that using hedging instead of precautionary savings is equivalent to reducing the
debt to GDP ratio of the country from 50% to a number between 32% and 40%.
Another important observation about the figure is that most of the benefits of hedging accrue
for intermediate values of the state variable. As the state variable approaches ±∞ all hedging
strategies start becoming irrelevant. The reason is intuitive. If st → ∞ then the hazard rate goes
to 0 and the expected time to the next sudden stop approaches infinity. Hence, the sudden stop is
“very far away”. Therefore any comparative benefits of one strategy over the other get so heavily
discounted, that they become essentially 0. By a similar reasoning, as st → −∞ the sudden stop
becomes imminent (and insurance against it too expensive).
A reassuring feature of Figure 5 is that the welfare benefits of only hedging diﬀusive risks is
significant and covers more than half of the distance to perfect hedging, irrespective of the level
of the state variable. This suggests that the benefits of hedging will accrue even when there is no
explicit insurance against jump risk. This is important since developing markets for jump (sudden
stop) risk is substantially harder than for diﬀusive risk, which are readily available in many cases.
Finally, note from the lowest line (with crosses) that ignoring hedging and the variability of
the sudden stop hazard –essentially accumulating precautionary savings at a constant rate– is
not too costly when the likelihood of a sudden stop is high as long as the country has the right
sense of the unconditional (on the signal) likelihood of a crisis: neither precautionary savings only
strategy is good at handling the sudden stop. However the cost of a non-contingent precautionary
savings strategy takes places during good times (high s), when the country overaccumulates costly
non-contingent resources when the low risk of a sudden stop does not justify it.
into a sudden stop in the next 10 years conditional on s0 = 0. We then determined the constant hazard rate λ so
that it will produce exactly the same probability.

5.2.3

Decomposing the Gains

Let us not decompose the gains from diﬀerent hedging strategies. Our model produces a clear
demarcation of time into three stages: Before a sudden stop, during a sudden stop, and after a
sudden stop. The marginal value of a dollar is highest during the sudden stop, somewhat lower in
the phase that precedes it and lowest in the post-sudden stop phase. Hence, a strategy produces
welfare gains if it manages to “shift” resources into the sudden stop and also into the phase before
the sudden stop.
Table 2 reports the results of a simple simulation exercise: We start with s0 = 0, and simulate
a number of paths for st for 10 years. We also simulate the arrival of sudden stops by drawing
independent exponential variables and using formula (11) to determine the time of arrival of sudden
stops. In about 67% of the simulated paths for st we observe a sudden stop within 10 years. We
then compute the behavior of c∗t , Xt along the path, consumption immediately following the sudden
stop c∗τ + and the associated consumption drop upon entering the sudden stop. Results are reported
for the four strategies of the previous section from worst to best: suboptimal precautionary savings,
optimal precautionary savings, diﬀusive hedging only, and perfect hedging. The first column shows
initial (excess) consumption, which is highest for perfect hedging and second highest for diﬀusive
hedging. The reason for this is that perfect hedging does not require precautionary savings, while
that of diﬀusive hedging requires less precautionary savings than the other two. It is the next three
columns that capture the most important results, however. The second column shows the level of
consumption at the time of the sudden stop, with a clear advantage for the hedged strategies; the
third column shows that the drop of consumption at the time of the sudden stop is significantly
lower in the case of diﬀusive and jump risk hedging. The reason why the diﬀerence in drops is
greater than that of levels at the time of sudden stop is important: In all but the full insurance
case, consumption rises over time as precautionary savings accumulate. But this also means that
in all the cases but the jump risk hedge case, the economy is relatively vulnerable if the sudden
stop happens in the near future, when the country has not had the time to accumulate resources.
This is reflected in the last column of the table, which shows the correlation between the time it
takes for the sudden stop to arrive and the level of consumption at the sudden stop. With jump
risk hedge, there is no correlation. With all the rest, this correlation is positive, although diﬀusive
hedging can also reduce it significantly.

Introducing risk premia

Up to now we have assumed no risk-premia on either diﬀusive or jump risk hedging. In this section
we go to the opposite extreme and ask: how large would the risk premia have to be for the country
to give up hedging?
The framework we developed in Section 6 is well suited to answer this question. In particular,
equation (45) shows that the “critical” risk premium that would render diﬀusive hedging pointless
is:
φ1 = −γσ 2

d

and equation (44) shows that the critical overestimation of the hazard (risk premium) for “jump”
hedging is:

Since d = b if p = 0 (no diﬀusive risk hedging) and I = 0 (no jump risk hedging) we can replace d
with the function b from Section 3.
Figure 6 reports the results when one computes the “critical risk premiums” φ1 and φ2 as
implied by the above formula, for the range of (log) price of copper observed in our sample. The
top panel shows that the critical risk premium for diﬀusive hedging is about 8%. The bottom panel
shows that the critical risk premium for jump risk hedging typically exceeds 100%. These large
critical premia confirm the benefits of hedging. For diﬀusive risks, which in many cases already
have up-and-running markets, 8% is very large when compared with reasonable premia in liquid

Sudden stops: Time variation in hazard rates and traded variables

In this section we argue that Chile is not an exception in terms of the usefulness of our analysis. For
this, we document two important ingredients for our framework: that there is a significant element
of predictability in sudden stops, and that this predictability is correlated with readily available
and tradable indices which are largely beyond the control of individual emerging market economies
(hence moral hazard is of limited concern). Moreover, we conduct this analysis in a simple reduced
form framework, so that our conclusions here are not intertwined with our specific methodology in
the rest of the paper.

6.1

Time Variation and Predictability of the Likelihood of Sudden Stops

We identify the sudden stop hazard using the data and methodology from Calvo, Izquierdo and
Mejia (2004). They identify sudden stops based on a number of cutoﬀs and indicators, which they
then use to run (probit) regressions against country specific variables (dollarization, openness etc.)
and time eﬀects. Their data are yearly and span the period 1990-2001 for 32 countries, of which
15 are emerging markets (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Indonesia,
Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand and Turkey). We focus
exclusively on the 15 emerging markets.
We essentially replicate the Calvo et al steps by running logit and probit regressions of the form:
yit = Pr(SS = 1) = F (x0it β)
We use the most significant variables reported in their paper, namely the degree of dollarization,
openness, and terms of trade, as well as time fixed eﬀects. After running the regressions, we isolate
b and the actual regressor values x0 β.
b

For example, the corresponding Sharpe ratio is 0.35 which is nearly twice the Sharpe ratio for the long sample

of the US stock market (see, e.g. Campbell and Cochrane (1999)).

b capture well the variation in the likelihood of
Assuming that the conditional probabilities F (x0 β)

running into a sudden stop, we investigate whether there is significant time variation in the hazard
rates. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 show that indeed the bulk of the variation is in the within (across
time) dimension as opposed to the between (across country) variation. Also, the standard deviation
of 0.24 indicates that the conditional probabilities of sudden stops vary substantially across time.
Time variability in the conditional probabilities is however not synonymous with predictability.
If there is little or no serial correlation in the conditional probabilities, then there is little benefit
from time varying precautionary accumulation of reserves, hedging etc. All these measures are
eﬀective if there is some persistence in the process that generates the conditional probabilities. The
next four rows in Table 3 report results from a dynamic panel data regression of the form:
yit = αi + β 1 yit−1 + β 2 yit−2 + εit
Rows 2 and 3 are simple fixed eﬀects regressions with robust standard errors. The next two rows
report the equivalent results when one uses the estimator of Arellano and Bond (1999), to avoid
the well known biases of dynamic panel data models. Uniformly, the results indicate substantial
persistence and hence predictability of the conditional probabilities.

6.2

Traded Variables and the variation of the conditional likelihood of Sudden
Stops

Sofar we have only examined whether there appears to be enough variation and persistence in the
conditional probability of sudden stops to justify time varying precautionary measures. A separate
question is whether traded instruments can be used to hedge away these risks. One way to answer
this question is to investigate whether there exist traded instruments that can “predict” the time
variation in the conditional probabilities. Table 4 addresses this question.
We use HYt−1 to denote the diﬀerence between Aaa and Baa bonds (high yield spread) as
reported in the historical series H.15 of the Federal Reserve. Columns (1) and (2) use the predicted

Table 4: Column (1): Regressions of first diﬀerences in the regressors x0it β used in Calvo et al.
(2004) on the lagged diﬀerence between Baa and Aaa bonds (L.HY ). Column (2) Same as column
(1) with the sole exception that we use diﬀerences in the (log) predicted probability log .F (x0it β)
in place of x0it β. Columns (3)-(4): Same as columns (1)-(2) using a logit instead of a probit model.
For all regressions we use panel corrected standard errors allowing for heteroskedasticity and contemporaneous correlation across panels. A constant is included but not reported.

b = α0 + α1 HYt−1 + εit
∆(x0it β)

b
∆ log(F (x0it β))
= α0 + α1 HYt−1 + εit

The first regression is a projection of the change in the regressors entering the probit model of
Calvo et. al. (2004) on the high yield spread at t − 1. The second regression performs a similar
exercise for the predicted probabilities. If, for instance, increases in the high yield spread coincide
with periods of high risk and risk aversion, then emerging markets might be exposed to contagion
risk. Hence, in a manner similar to copper for Chile, variations in the HY can be used to form a
hedging strategy.
As Table 4 shows, the R-squared of these regressions is close to 20%. Hence, 20% of the innovations in the conditional probabilities are predicted by a variable that belongs to the information
set of agents at time t − 1 and has a liquid market. To put this in perspective, in Table 3 the total
predictable variation in the conditional probabilities was about 37% of their variation in the sample.
Comparing the two numbers reveals a substantial co-variation between the predicted hazard and
HYt−1 .
Note that the coeﬃcient has the expected sign since HY is mean reverting, thus a high degree
44

of HY today predicts a lower HY tomorrow and hence a lower likelihood of a sudden stop. To see
b
this point more clearly, suppose that there is positive contemporaneous correlation between ∆x0it β
and ∆HYt , i.e. suppose that:

b = α0 + α
E(∆x0it β)
e 1 E(∆HYt ) with α
e1 > 0

(49)

Now assume that HYt is a simple AR(1) process:

HYt = ρHYt−1 + εV,t

with ρ < 1

so that:
∆HYt = HYt − HYt−1 = (ρ − 1)HYt−1 + εV,t
and also:
E (∆HYt ) = (ρ − 1)HYt−1

(50)

Plugging (50) into (49) shows that:
b = α0 + α
E(∆x0it β)
e 1 (ρ − 1)HYt−1

Hence the regressions in Table 4 produce a negative sign on lagged HY since α
e 1 (ρ − 1) < 0.

The main reason why HY performs well in terms of predictive power is that it captures well the

common variation of the arrival of sudden stops across countries. To illustrate this, we computed
the average yearly diﬀerence in the probability of a sudden stop as implied by the probit model.
Then we plotted the (negative of) the high yield (lagged once) against it. Figure 7 illustrates the
strong comovement between the two series.

Final Remarks

In this paper we characterized several aspects of sudden stops, precautionary contractions, and
the corresponding aggregate hedging strategies. For this, we built a model simple enough to shed
analytical light on some of the key issues but realistic enough to provide some quantitative guidance.
We showed that even after removing all other sources of uncertainty, the optimal path of aggregate demand in an unhedged emerging market economy exhibits large precautionary contractions.
That is contractions that precede sudden stops. We then argued that smooth diﬀusive hedging could
remove much of these fluctuations even in the absence of more complex jump hedging mechanisms.

The gains from these hedging strategies are large, which raises the question of why aren’t
countries already doing this in a significant manner. Our somewhat informed belief is that the
problem is mostly one of coordination, which could be reduced significantly with the involvement
of the international financial institutions (IFIs).
On one end, hedging along the lines we have suggested is not standard practice for external
liability management: Any sensible policymaker knows that the political (and personal) cost of
something going wrong while implementing an unorthodox strategy is many times larger than that
of failing while following the standard recipe. The IFIs can help by modernizing their advice on
standard practices.
On the other, while one can imagine many indicators that could be used to start improving
hedging strategies immediately, such as the price of commodities, the high yield spread (HY), the
volatility index (VIX), indicators of US and other developed regions activity, and so on, some of
these markets are not nearly as large as they would need to be (recall that the issue is not to
hedge the income eﬀect of commodity price fluctuations but the sudden stop, which is significantly
lager, and probably not just as a multiplier but also as a bellwether). Market creation requires
coordination, and the development of a few general indices that can ensure adequate liquidity.
Again, the IFIs can help develop these markets. For example, the IMF could modify its contingent
credit lines to index them to indicators that could eventually be adopted by the private sector and
traded in open markets.

Proofs for section 2.2

(54)

This constant can be interpreted as the “excess” wealth at date τ + T (that is, the wealth in excess
of that which is needed to cover the reservation-consumption level κyt ). During the sudden stop
(τ ≤ t ≤ τ + T ) we can use the continuation value function, V (Xτ +T , yτ∗+T ), from above, to write
the maximization problem for the sudden stop phase:
Z τ +T ∗ 1−γ

by (5). Since the country is growing and wishes to expand its consumption at a faster rate than the
constraint allows, it can be easily shown18 that the sudden stop constraint, (55), is always binding
Xτ +T = X τ +T .

Given this result, the optimization problem is straightforward. It is a deterministic consumption
problem subject to a final wealth condition. A few steps of algebra show that:
c∗t =

It is easy to see from these expressions that as X τ +T rises, c∗t falls. The country has to cut back
consumption during the crisis in order to satisfy a tighter sudden-stop constraint. We are now ready
to determine the sudden-stop value function:
Z ∞

It is easy to verify that our careful choice of the constraint pays oﬀ at this stage. The value function

(60)

where V (Xτ , yτ∗ ) denotes the value function in the absence of a sudden-stop constraint and K is
the constant given in the statement of the proposition. K > 1 is a straightforward consequence of
the fact that the value function (which is negative if γ > 1) has to be lower than the value function
in the absence of the constraint (55) A simple diﬀerentiation shows that Kζ > 0 as long as γ > 1.

Theorem.

Propositions and Proofs for section 3.2

Proposition 5 If there exists a function b(s) solving (20) subject to (21) and (22) then (17) solves
(15) and is the value function of the problem as long as:

(61)

Proof. Substituting (17) into (15) and performing some obvious simplifications leads to (20).

The reason why b(st ) has to satisfy the boundary conditions (21) and (22) follows from the next
proposition (proposition 6). Since (17) satisfies (15) for b(st ) solving (20), a classical verification
theorem can be invoked to show that it must be the value function as long as the “tail” condition
(61) is satisfied (Fleming and Soner (1993) p.172).
The above proposition is a “place-holder” for all the properties that need to be verified in order
to establish that (17) is the value function of the problem. We start by showing that the boundaries
to b are given by (21) and (22).
Proposition 6 The value function of the problem with sudden stops for s > s satisfies:

(62)

Proof. We focus on the γ > 1 case. The proof proceeds in two steps. First one obtains an
upper bound on the value function of the problem with sudden stops, which in this case is naturally
given by the value function of the problem in the absence of sudden stops:
³
´
µ ¶γ X + yτ∗ 1−γ

It tuns out that this expression is also a lower bound to the value function when st goes to infinity.
The lower bound is established upon observing that the consumption policy in the absence of

Since the upper and the lower bound coincide to V N SS as s → ∞, the claim is established. A
similar claim can be used to show the second result in the proposition.
Showing formally that b(st ) possesses a unique solution subject to the two boundary conditions
(21) and (22) is a fairly hard mathematical task that is well beyond the scope of the present paper.
The next Proposition provides a sketch of how one would proceed to obtain a proof. For the
substantive results of the paper, we were always able to obtain numerically a solution to this ODE
at arbitrary precision levels.
Proposition 7 There exists a solution to the ODE (20) subject to (21) and (22).
Proof. (Sketch) First we transform the second order ODE into a system of ODE’s. Then
we compute the steady states at s = +∞ and s = −∞, linearize the system and compute its
eigenvalues. Using the stable manifold theorem around s = 0 twice (as s → +∞ and as s → −∞)
establishes the result. For more details see Caballero and Panageas (2003) Proposition 3.
54

The last step in order to verify that (17) is indeed the Value function is to verify (61). To show
(61) we need two Lemmas:

Lemma 4 Consider a consumption policy that has the feedback form:
¶
µ
y∗

c∗t = A(st ) Xt + t

Then Xt ≥ XtNSS , where XtNSS is the asset process that results when one uses the optimal
consumption policy in the absence of sudden stops:

to find that

r−g
The result now follows since A(st ) ≤ r ∀st ∈ (−∞, +∞).
Lemma 5 The function b(s) is bounded between 1r K 1/γ and 1r .
Proof. We will derive the result by means of a contradiction. Suppose b(s) solves (20) subject
to the boundary conditions (21),(22). Since b(s) asymptotes to

1
r

as s → ∞ and to b as s → −∞

this means that if there exists a b >b then there must be a s∗ such that b(s∗ ) >b and b(s∗ ) is a
local max. Similarly if there exists a b <

1
r

then there must be a s∗ such that b(s∗ ) <
55

1
r

is a local

min. Both are impossible though. We establish the first contradiction. The second is obtained
similarly. Indeed, suppose that there exists one point s∗ such that bs (s∗ ) = 0 and b(s∗ ) > b. Then
(20) becomes:
b(s∗ )

1 − rb(s ) +
γ

¸

which in turn implies that bss (s∗ ) > 0 since the left hand side of the above equation is negative.
Hence every extremum in the area b(s∗ ) > b must be a local minimum, and cannot be a maximum.
Similarly if b(s∗ ) < 1r , a symmetric argument can be used, to show that is impossible to have a
local min in this region.
Now, we are in a position to establish the “tail condition” (61):
