    "abstract": "\n\nRecent empirical evidence has suggested that the Japanese mutual fund industry has\" underperformed dramatically over the past two decades.  Conjectured reasons for\" underperformance range from tax-dilution effects to high fees, high turnover and poor asset\" management.  In this paper, we show that this underperformance is largely due to tax-dilution\" effects, and not necessarily to poor management.  Using a broad database of funds which\" includes investment trusts closed to new investment, we show that once an instrument for the\" time-varying tax-dilution exposure is included in a factor model, there is little evidence of poor\" risk-adjusted performance.  A style analysis of the industry demonstrates that managers appear to\" pursue tax-driven dynamic strategies.\n\n",
