    "abstract": "\n\nAmid an aging population and a growing role for private equity (PE) in elder care, this paper studies how PE ownership a\ufb00ects U.S. nursing homes using patient-level Medicare data. We show that PE ownership leads to lower-risk patients and increases mortality. After instrumenting for the patient-nursing home match, we recover a local average treatment e\ufb00ect on mortality of 11%. Declines in measures of patient well-being, nurse sta\ufb03ng, and compliance with care standards help to explain the mortality e\ufb00ect. Overall, we conclude that PE has nuanced e\ufb00ects, with adverse outcomes for a subset of patients.\n\n",
