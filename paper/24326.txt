ABSTRACT
Earnings dynamics are much richer than typically assumed in macro models with heterogeneous
agents. This holds for individual-pre-tax and household-post-tax earnings and across
administrative (Social Security Administration) and survey (Panel Study of Income Dynamics)
data. We estimate two alternative processes for household after-tax earnings and study their
implications using a standard life-cycle model. Both processes feature a persistent and a
transitory component, but while the first one is the canonical linear process with stationary
shocks, the second one has substantially richer earnings dynamics, allowing for age-dependence
of moments, non-normality, and nonlinearity in previous earnings and age. Allowing for richer
earnings dynamics implies a substantially better fit of the evolution of cross-sectional
consumption inequality over the life cycle and of the individual-level degree of consumption
insurance against persistent earnings shocks. The richer earnings process also implies lower
welfare costs of earnings risk.

Introduction

Macroeconomic models with heterogeneous agents are ideal laboratory economies to quantitatively study a large set of issues that include household behavior under uncertainty,
inequality, and the effects of taxes, transfers, and social insurance reforms.1 Earnings risk is
a crucial source of heterogeneity in these models and its stochastic properties determine how
saving and consumption adjust to buffer the impact of earnings shocks on current and future
consumption. Appropriately capturing earnings risk is therefore important to understand
consumption and wealth inequality, the welfare implications of income fluctuations, and the
potential role for social insurance.
With few notable exceptions, most quantitative macroeconomic models adopt earnings
processes that imply that persistence and other second and higher conditional moments are
independent of age and earnings histories, and that shocks are normally distributed. The
canonical permanent/transitory process is a popular example.
A growing body of empirical work, though, provides evidence that households’ earnings
dynamics feature non-normality, age-dependence, and nonlinearities, and devises flexible statistical models that allow for these features. For instance, recent work takes advantage of
large, administrative datasets (e.g., W2 confidential Social Security Administration earnings data in Guvenen, Karahan, Ozkan and Song, 2016) and new methodologies applied to
survey data sets like the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) (Arellano, Blundell and
Bonhomme, 2017) to show that changes to pre-tax, individual male earnings display substantial skewness and kurtosis and that the persistence of shocks depends both on age and
current earnings.2

For instance, Scholz, Seshadri and Khitatrakun (2006) study the adequacy of savings at retirement,
Storesletten, Telmer and Yaron (2004a); Krueger and Perri (2006); Heathcote, Storesletten and Violante
(2010) study the evolution of consumption and Castañeda, Dı́az-Giménez and Rı́os-Rull (2003); De Nardi
(2004); Cagetti and De Nardi (2009) study the evolution of wealth inequality over the life cycle, while Conesa,
Kitao and Krueger (2009) study the optimal taxation of capital income.
2
These features are consistent with several factors that affect the working lives of individuals. For instance,
younger people tend to change jobs more frequently and this implies that the persistence of their earnings
is lower. In addition, for most workers, earnings vary little from year to year and shocks are infrequent but
can be of large magnitude, such as job loss or a career change, when they happen. This is captured by the

2

We show that all of these rich dynamics are present not only in individual pre-tax earnings, both in the W2 tax data and the PSID, but also in household, after-tax earnings, which
are the relevant source of labor income risk at the household level.3
Our main contribution is to analyze the effects of richer earnings dynamics on consumption, wealth, and welfare, both in the cross-section and over the life cycle. We use the
econometric framework recently proposed by Arellano et al. (2017) to separately identify
the distributions of the persistent and transitory components of earnings while allowing for
non-normality of shocks, non-linear persistence, and, in general, a rich dependence of the
two distributions on age and (in the case of the persistent component) previous earnings. We
use PSID data on after-tax, household earnings to estimate two different earnings processes:
a richer earnings process along the lines of Arellano et al. (2017) and a “canonical” linear
earnings process with a persistent and transitory component and normal innovations, like
the one used in Storesletten et al. (2004a). For each process, we use two Markov chains to
approximate the conditional distributions, respectively, of persistent and transitory shocks
and introduce them into a partial-equilibrium, life-cycle model with incomplete markets to
compare their implications for consumption, wealth, and welfare.4
Our main findings are as follows. First, compared to the canonical earnings process, the
richer earnings process better fits the observed evolution of consumption inequality over the
life cycle. More specifically, under the canonical earnings process, the growth in the variance
of consumption substantially overshoots its data counterpart at all ages, while our richer
process generates a realistic profile up to ages 50-55, when early and partial retirement start
being important. The improved fit is due to the rich features of the earnings data that we
high level of kurtosis displayed by earnings changes.
3
One caveat is that, in line with much of the previous literature, we take earnings as a primitive while
earnings fluctuations likely partly reflect endogenous labour supply choices.
4
Although our paper is highly indebted to Arellano et al. (2017), it differs from it in important respects.
First, Arellano et al. (2017) estimate their earnings process on pre-tax earnings of households headed by
participating and married males while we use after-tax earnings for all households. Secondly, Arellano et al.
(2017) estimate the consumption rule semi-parametrically while we obtain it using the full model structure
and, for the same reason, we can study welfare implications. Finally, the emphasis of Arellano et al. (2017)
is on the consumption response to earnings shocks while we consider a wider range of implications.

model and to the households’ precautionary saving response to them. In particular, the
age-dependent persistence and variance of earnings innovations account for the main share
of the improvement of the fit between age 25 and 45, while non-normality and, in particular,
nonlinearity (for instance, the fact that persistence varies with the level of previous earnings)
drive the improvement between age 45 and 55.
An alternative, and possibly more intuitive, measure of self-insurance is the extent of
consumption passthrough of shocks to disposable earnings onto consumption. Our second
finding is that the richer earnings process implies a consumption passthrough of persistent
earnings shocks broadly consistent with the data. Its value is 0.57 which is within one standard deviation of the point estimate of 0.64 by Blundell, Pistaferri and Preston (2008). This
result too is driven by the age-dependent persistence of shocks and can be understood in
light of Kaplan and Violante’s (2010) finding that a persistent, but not permanent, earnings process can imply the “right” level of insurance against persistent shocks. The richer
earnings process implies a significantly lower degree of persistence of the persistent earnings
component, particularly at younger ages, compared to the canonical process. Consequently,
persistent shocks, particularly at younger ages when assets are low, are more easily selfinsured through borrowing and lending.
Our third finding is that our rich earnings process does not improve the fit of the right tail
of the wealth distribution with respect to the canonical earnings process.5 This is perhaps
not so surprising given an established literature, surveyed in De Nardi and Fella (2017),
pointing to the fact that accounting for the saving of the rich requires mechanisms—such
as a non-homothetic bequest motive, medical-expense risk and entrepreneurship—that go
beyond idiosyncratic earnings risk.
Finally, from a normative perspective we find that the welfare costs of earnings risk—as
measured by the yearly consumption equivalent—are 2 percentage points lower under the
5

In De Nardi, Fella and Paz-Pardo (2016) we show that this conclusion still holds if we estimate a similar
richer process on synthetically generated W2 data from the parametric processes proposed in Guvenen et al.
(2016). It is thus not related to issues of lack-of-oversampling and non-participation by higher income people
that are usually associated with most survey data sets.

richer earnings process than under the canonical one. The main reason for this finding is
again that, while under the canonical process earnings have a permanent, random-walk,
component, the richer process implies a lower persistence, particularly in the first part of
the working life. As a result, life-cycle risk can be more effectively self-insured under the
richer earnings process. Interestingly, the reduction in welfare costs would be even higher—4
rather than 2 percentage points—in the absence of non-normality and nonlinearities that
partly offsets the welfare gains due to age-dependent persistence and innovation variances.
An additional contribution of this paper is to propose a simple, simulation-based, method
to discretize nonlinear and nonnormal stochastic processes to introduce them in a computational model. Standard discretization methods used in macroeconomics, such as Tauchen
(1986) and Rouwenhorst (1995), require the continuous process to be approximated to be linear, typically an AR(1), and, in the case of Tauchen (1986), normal.6 Our method applies to
any, otherwise unrestricted, age-dependent, first-order Markov process. It relies on simulating a panel of individual earnings histories using the continuous process to be approximated
and estimating an age-specific, first-order Markov chain on it. This is achieved by discretizing
the simulated marginal distribution of earnings at each age—e.g. into percentiles—and by
replacing the (heterogeneous) values of earnings in each rank percentile with their median.
The associated, age-specific transition matrix is then obtained by computing the proportion
of observations transiting from each percentile rank of the earnings distribution at age t to
that at age t + 1. The result is a non-parametric representation of the process that follows a
Markov chain with an age-dependent transition matrix and a fixed number of age-dependent
earnings states.7
Our paper is related to the econometric literature on earnings dynamics8 as well as the
6

Fella, Gallipoli and Pan (2017) show how Tauchen (1986) and Rouwenhorst (1995) can be extended to
allow for age dependence. Their method still requires linearity though.
7
It should be noted that our method can be generalized to allow for Markov processes of order higher
than one.

macroeconomic literature on the relationship between income and consumption and wealth
inequality over the life cycle. Deaton and Paxson (1994) is the seminal empirical contribution. Storesletten et al. (2004a), Guvenen (2007), Primiceri and Van Rens (2009), Huggett,
Ventura and Yaron (2011) and Guvenen and Smith (2014) analyze lifetime inequality from
the perspective of the standard, incomplete markets model as we do here. Within this
literature, many of the consequences of richer earnings processes on consumption, savings
and welfare in structural models are still unexplored, with few exceptions. Castañeda et al.
(2003) propose an “awesome or superstar” shock to earnings that is unlikely to be observed
in the data but that can help to explain the emergence of super-rich people. Karahan and
Ozkan (2013) study the implications of age-dependent persistence and variance of shocks.
McKay (2017) finds that taking into account the procyclical nature of negative skewness in
earnings growth rates substantially raises the volatility of aggregate consumption growth.
Golosov, Troshkin and Tsyvinski (2016) show that higher order moments of earnings shocks
are important determinants of optimal redistribution and insurance. Civale, Dı́ez-Catalán
and Fazilet (2016) study the implications of skewness and kurtosis for the aggregate capital
stock in an economy à la Aiyagari (1994).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the main features of
the data on earnings dynamics for both individuals and households. Section 3 details the
methods we use to estimate the canonical and nonlinear earnings processes and their implications. Section 4 explains the discretization procedure we propose to tractably introduce rich
nonlinear earnings dynamics in a quantitative life-cycle model. Section 5 presents the model
and its calibration. Section 6 discusses the consumption, wealth, and welfare implications
of the two earnings processes that we consider, and decomposes the determinants of their
differences. Section 7 concludes. The Appendix discusses key features of the PSID data,
details of the estimation and reports a number of robustness checks.

Earnings data and their features

Recent empirical literature has called into question the established view that (log-)earnings
dynamics are well approximated by a linear model of which the canonical random-walk permanent/transitory model (Abowd and Card, 1989) with normal innovations is a popular
example. Linear models imply that persistence and other second and higher moments are
independent of earnings histories. Instead, Guvenen et al. (2016) and Arellano et al. (2017)
document that, contrary to the implications of the canonical model, individual pre-tax earnings display both substantial deviations from log-normality and non-linearity.
Guvenen et al. (2016) use confidential Social Security Administration (W2) tax data to
establish these facts. The W2 data set has both advantages and disadvantages compared to
the PSID data (and household survey data sets more generally). Regarding its advantages,
the W2 data set has a large number of observations, is less likely to be contaminated by
measurement error, and is not affected by top-coding and differential survey responses. Thus,
it could provide better information on the top earners to the extent that they do not respond
to surveys but do pay taxes on all of their earnings. An important disadvantage of the W2
data set is that it is collected at the individual level and lacks the information to identify
households and thus to construct household earnings.
The latter is an important shortcoming. In the U.S., the majority of adults are married,
95% of married couples file their income taxes jointly, and taxation of couples and singles is
different. Therefore, one needs to know the earnings of both people in a household in order
to compute disposable earnings. In this respect household survey data sets that keep track of
household structure, like the PSID, have a distinct advantage. This is particularly important
if, as we do here, one wants to understand the implications of earnings risk for consumption
insurance, which requires taking into account that households and taxes provide insurance
against earnings shocks. For such a purpose, disposable household earnings is the relevant
variable of interest.
The data used in this paper are from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), 19687

1992. Our sample consists of households who are in the representative core sample, whose
head is between 25 and 60 years of age. Given the paper’s focus on the implications of
earnings risk for consumption insurance, our main variable of interest is disposable household
labor earnings, although we also discuss the properties of individual pre-tax labor earnings
for the purpose of comparison with some closely related work (e.g. Arellano et al., 2017;
Guvenen et al., 2016).
Disposable, household labor earnings are defined as the sum of household labor income
and transfers, such as welfare payments, net of taxes and Social Security contributions paid.
Appendix A contains a more detailed description of the PSID data we use, our definition
of household earnings and how we estimate taxes on labor following Guvenen and Smith
(2014).
We adjust our earnings measure for demographic differences across households, since
these have no counterpart in the model in Section 5. We do so by regressing log earnings on
family size. We apply the same regression to the CEX consumption data we use to compute
the moments reported in Section 6. The residuals from these regressions are interpreted
as earnings and consumption per-adult equivalent in the analysis below. For both earnings
and consumption, we extract business cycle effects by running a regression of their log levels
on year dummies. Finally, we separate the predictable from the stochastic component of
earnings by running a regression of our equivalized earnings measure on age dummies. We
use the residuals to estimate the stochastic processes for earnings in what follows.

Individual pre-tax earnings in the PSID and the W2 data

with those in the W2 data reported by Guvenen et al. (2016).

and the PSID. The top row, derived from the moments reported by Guvenen et al. (2016),

age and percentile of previous earnings. The middle row of the same figure reports the same
moments, by age and decile of previous earnings, for the PSID.9
Comparing these two sets of figures shows that, overall, the moments in the PSID data
are both qualitatively and quantitatively close to those computed from the W2 data. More
specifically, the conditional standard deviation of individual pre-tax log earnings growth is
U-shaped across all age groups, declining until the 40th percentile and increasing again from
the 90th percentile onwards. The increase is more pronounced for the top percentiles in the

For comparability with Guvenen et al. (2016), we report moments for households whose head is a male.
All moments are very close to those including female household heads. We show moments for 10-year age

equal weights for each 5-year age group.

W2, likely reflecting the coarser partition of the distribution in the PSID data. The most
notable difference is the much higher variance at all percentiles above the 20th in the W2
data.
The figures also show that in both datasets individual pre-tax log earnings growth has
strong negative skewness and very high kurtosis, and that these moments differ by both
age and previous earnings. Skewness is more negative for individuals in higher earnings
percentiles and for individuals in the 45-54 age group. This indicates that individuals face
a larger downward risk in middle age.10 The comparison of the implications of the two data
sets also reveals that, if anything, there is more negative skewness in the PSID data than in
the W2 data, except perhaps at the lowest earnings percentiles.
The kurtosis of individual pre-tax log earnings growth is hump-shaped by earnings percentile. Even for kurtosis, the maximum value is higher in the PSID, 40, against 30 in the
W2 data (compared to 3 for a standard normal distribution).11
Taken together, these moments provide strong evidence against the standard assumption
of a log-normal and linear earnings process for individual pre-tax log earnings growth for the
PSID data, as well as for the W2 data.

2.2

Individual pre-tax versus household disposable earnings in the
PSID

Now that we have shown that individual pre-tax earnings growth in both the W2 and PSID
data displays remarkably similar deviations from normality and linearity, we turn to contrasting the properties of individual pre-tax and disposable household earnings in the PSID.
The bottom row in Figure 1 reports the same moments as the first two rows but for
10

Graber and Lise (2015) generate this kind of earnings behavior in the context of a search and matching
model with a job ladder.
11
The levels and profiles of skewness and kurtosis of individual pre-tax log earnings growth are similar
in the two datasets also when looking at report robust measures that exclude outliers (Kelly skewness and
Crow-Siddiqui kurtosis). The main difference is a higher level of Crow-Siddiqui kurtosis in the W2 data than
in the PSID (see Appendix C).

10

disposable household log earnings growth (bottom row) in the PSID. Comparing the bottom
to the middle row reveals that, as one might have expected, disposable household earnings
display lower variance, skewness, and kurtosis than pre-tax individual earnings. More specifically, the standard deviation is about 20% smaller at the lower end of the distribution of
previous earnings, while skewness and kurtosis are about half as large. Thus, households
and taxes perform an important insurance role in buffering individuals from pre-tax earnings changes (as shown by Blundell, Pistaferri and Saporta-Eksten (2016)). This has to be
taken into account when considering the economic implications of earnings shocks.
To sum up, the above discussion has shown that, even after taking into account the
insurance implied by pooling at the household level and the tax and welfare system, labor
earnings display features that contrast with the age-independence, normality, and linearity
(independence of variance, skewness and kurtosis of previous earnings realizations) implied
by the canonical earnings process.
The same is true of another aspect on nonlinearity, nonlinear persistence, that has been
documented by Arellano et al. (2017) using pre-tax earnings from the PSID. Figure 2 shows
how this same feature is prominent also for disposable household earnings. It reports earnings
persistence as a function of both the previous- and current-earnings rank in our PSID sample.
In line with Arellano et al.’s (2017) findings, we also find that earnings persistence is lower
(about 0.6) when previous earnings are highest and the current earning shock is lowest and
when previous earnings are lowest and the current earning shock is highest (0.4).

Earnings processes and their estimation

3.1

Earnings processes

We start by introducing the canonical linear model of earnings dynamics used in macroeconomics before presenting its nonlinear generalization in Arellano et al. (2017).
Consider a cohort of households indexed by i and denote by t = 1, . . . , T the age of the
household head. Let yit denote the logarithm of (residual) disposable household earnings for
household i at age t which can be decomposed as

(1)

yit = ηit + εit , i = 1, . . . , N, t = 1, . . . , T

where η and ε are assumed to have absolutely continuous distributions. The first component,
ηit , is assumed to be persistent and to follow a first-order Markov process. The second
component, εit , is assumed to be transitory, have zero mean, be independent over time and
of ηis for all s.

12

The canonical (linear) model used in macroeconomics is described by

(2)

ηi,t = ρηi,t−1 + ζit ,

(3)

ηi1 ∼ N (0, ση1 ), ζit ∼ N (0, σζ ), εit ∼ N (0, σε ).

id

iid

iid

Thus, the persistent component ηit is an autoregressive process of order one with the innovation ζit independent of ηi,t−1 , while the transitory component εit is white noise.
Equations (2)-(3) impose three types of restrictions
1. Age-independence (stationarity) of the autoregressive coefficient ρ and of the shock
distributions, which imply age-independence of the second and higher moments of the
conditional distributions of both the transitory and the persistent component. This is
clearly at odds with the strong age-dependence in Figure 1.
2. Normality of the shock distributions, which is inconsistent with the negative skewness
and high kurtosis discussed above.
3. Linearity of the process for the persistent component. Linearity implies: (a) the additive separability of the right hand side of equation (2) into the conditional expectation—
the first addendum—and an innovation ζit independent of ηi,t−1 , and (b) the linearity
of the conditional expectation in ηi,t−1 . Under separability, deviations of ηit from its
conditional expectation are just a function of the innovation ζit . As a consequence, all
conditional centered second and higher moments are independent of previous realizations of η. This is clearly inconsistent with the dependence of the moments reported in
figures 1 and 2 on previous earnings realizations.
The evidence discussed in Section 2.1 is what motivates us to consider a more general process
that relaxes the above three restrictions while maintaining the first-order Markov assumption
for η. The question of how to easily introduce a richer and yet tractable earnings process in
a structural model is non-trivial and part of what we propose in this paper.
13

We proceed in two steps. First, we use the quantile-based panel data method proposed by
Arellano et al. (2017) to estimate a non-parametric model that allows for age-dependence,
non-normality and nonlinearity, and that can be applied in datasets of moderate sample
size like the PSID. This step gives us quantile functions for both the two (persistent and
transitory) component of earnings. Second, we use the two quantile functions to simulate
histories for the two earnings components and proceed to estimate, for each of them, a
discrete Markov-chain approximation, which can then be easily introduced in a structural
model (this latter step is discussed in detail in Section 4).
Let Qz (q|·), the conditional quantile function for the variable z, denote the qth conditional
quantile of z.12 The process for η can be written in a very general form by replacing equation
(2) with
iid

ηit = Qη (vit |ηi,t−1 , t), vit ∼ U (0, 1), t > 1.

(4)

Intuitively, the quantile function maps random draws vit from the uniform distribution over
(0, 1) (cumulative probabilities) into corresponding random (quantile) draws for η. In the
linear case in equation (2) the quantile function specializes to the linearly separable form
Qη (vit |ηi,t−1 , t) = ρηi,t−1 + φ−1 (vit ; σζ ), where φ−1 (vit ; σζ ) is the inverse of the cumulative
density function of a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviations σζ . So,
age-independence, normality, and linearity can be seen as restrictions on the quantile function
in equation (4).
In particular, one way to understand the role of nonlinearity is in terms of a generalized
notion of persistence

(5)

ρ(q|ηi,t−1 , t) =

∂Qη (q|ηi,t−1 , t)
∂ηi,t−1

12

Intuitively, the conditional quantile function is the inverse of the conditional cumulative density function
of the variable z mapping from the (0, 1) interval into the support of z. Namely, zq = Qz (q|·) satisfies
P [z ≤ zq |·] = q, where P [·|·] denotes the conditional probability.

14

which measures the persistence of ηi,t−1 when it is hit by a shock that has rank q. In the
canonical model, ρ(q|ηi,t−1 , t) = ρ, independently of both the past realization of ηi,t−1 and of
the shock rank q. Instead, the general model allows persistence to depend both on the past
realization ηi,t−1 , but also on the sign and magnitude of the shock realization. Basically, in the
nonlinear model shocks are allowed to wipe out the memory of past shocks or, equivalently,
the future persistence of a current shock may depend on future shocks.
Of course, a similar unrestricted representation can be used for the transitory component
εit and the initial condition η1 , with the only difference that they are not persistent.

where the coefficients aik (q), i = ε, η1 , η, are modelled as piecewise-linear splines in q on a

specified as the quantiles of an exponential distribution with parameters λi1 and λiL .
If the two earnings components εit and ηit were observable one could compute the polynomial coefficients simply by quantile regression for each point of the quantile grid qj . To
deal with the latent earnings components, the estimation algorithm starts from an initial
guess for the coefficients and iterates sequentially between draws from the posterior distribution of the latent persistent components of earnings and quantile regression estimation until

Reported standard errors are computed by bootstrapping. In particular, we sample with
replacement pairs of observations yt , yt+1 from our PSID sample and then run the estimation
algorithm for a large number of those samples.

3.3

Estimating the canonical linear earnings process

We estimate the canonical process for residual earnings in equations (1)-(3) using GMM,
where the target moments are variance and autocovariance age profiles in the data.14 The
associated standard errors are obtained by bootstrapping. Table 1 reports our results. As
common in the literature, we find that the persistent component has a unit root.15 For this
reason, though we have allowed for individual fixed effects at the estimation stage, their
variance cannot be identified separately from the variance of the initial condition ση21 and we
have normalized it to zero.

3.4

Comparing the implications of the nonlinear and canonical
earning processes

To understand the economic implications of the nonlinear and canonical earnings processes,
it is useful to compare their implications in terms of (a) age-dependence of second moments;
(b) non-normality; (c) nonlinearity.
14

Appendix A.4.2 provides more information about our estimation method.
The unrestricted GMM estimation returns an estimate of ρ = 1.01. Given that there has been little
exploration of the explosive case in the literature, and that we want our canonical process to be standard,
the above estimates are obtained under the restriction ρ ≤ 1. The resulting estimate is at the bound.

Figure 3: Age dependence of second moments: nonlinear vs canonical process. Top left, standard
deviation of the innovation to the persistent component. Top right, standard deviation of the transitory shock. Bottom left, autocorrelation of the persistent component. Bottom right, cross-sectional
variance of log earnings. The dotted bands represent bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals.

Starting from the age-dependence of second moments, the top row of Figure 3 plots
the age profile of the standard deviations of the shocks to the persistent and transitory
components of earnings. Both are age-independent by construction in the canonical process.
The standard deviation of shocks to the persistent component is substantially higher for
the nonlinear process and follows a U-shaped pattern by age. In contrast, the standard
deviation of the transitory component of the nonlinear process displays little age variation
and is lower in the nonlinear than in the canonical model. The bottom left panel of Figure 3
reports the age-profile of the first-order autocorrelation of the persistent earnings component
for the two processes. In the nonlinear earnings process it is lower than in the canonical
case for all ages, but it does increase between age 25 and 45. Given these differences, it
is not surprising that the nonlinear process provides a substantially better fit of the age
profile of the cross-sectional earnings dispersion, which we display in the bottom right panel
17

of Figure 316 . More specifically, the canonical earnings process cannot capture the convex
shape of the cross-sectional variance of earnings by age while the nonlinear process provides
an extremely close fit, thanks to the combination of increasing persistence and declining
variance of the persistent component over the ages 25 to 45. It is also apparent that the
canonical model requires a low variance of the persistent shocks relative to the transitory
ones to match the relatively low rate of growth of the cross-sectional variance of earnings
over the life-cycle. Figure 4 displays more evidence on age-dependence, which also manifests

The discretized nonlinear earnings process

To use the estimated process (1)-(3) in the life-cycle model, we discretize it using an agedependent Markov chain.17
We start by simulating a large set of histories for the persistent and transitory component
17

In theory, one could solve the model using a non-finite state space method, such as the Parameterized
Expectations Algorithm (PAE) (e.g. den Haan and Marcet, 1990), simulating earnings histories using the
estimated quantile functions directly. In practice, the computational costs of PAE are very large in life-cycle
models with realistic lifetimes, given the non-stationarity of the policy functions. This likely explains why
we are not aware of any paper using PAE to solve a life-cycle model.

19

of earnings. For each component in the simulated sample, we estimate a Markov chain of
order one, with age-dependent state space Z t = {z̄1 , . . . , z̄N }, t = 1, . . . , T and an age
dependent transition matrices Πt , of size (N × N ). That is, we assume that the dimension
N of the state space is constant across ages but we allow the set of states and the transition
matrices to be age-dependent.
We determine the points of the state-space and the transition matrices at each age in the
following way.
1. At each age, we order the realizations of each component by their size and we group
them into N bins. Due to the limited sample size of the PSID, we want to strike a
balance between a rich approximation of the earnings dynamics by earnings level (a
large number of bins) and keeping the sample size in each bin sufficiently large. In our
main specification we report the results for bins representing deciles, with the exception
of the top and bottom deciles, that we split in 5. Thus, bins 1 to 5 and 14 to 18 include
2% of the agents at any given age, while bins n = 6, . . . , 13 include 10% of the agents
at any given age. This implies a total of 18 bins.
2. The points of the state space at each age t are chosen so that point ztn is the median in
bin n at age t. Kennan (2006) proves that setting the gridpoint at the median of the
bin (in the specific case of equally-sized bins) and attributing a weight of 1/N to each
of the N bins constitutes the best discrete approximation of an arbitrary distribution.
3. The initial distribution at model age 0 is the empirical distribution at the first age we
consider.
t
4. The elements πmn
of the transition matrix Πt between age t and t+1 are the proportion

of individuals in bin m at age t that are in bin n at age t + 1.
Allowing for an age-dependent Markov chain allows to capture the non-constancy of
moments of the earnings distribution over the life-cycle. The flexible form of the transition
20

matrix allows to capture nonlinearities as a function of current earnings. The use of this
kind of transition matrices is well established in the literature. Krueger and Perri (2003)
use them to study the welfare consequences of an increase in earnings inequality. Studies of
income mobility (e.g. Jäntti and Jenkins (2015)) and consumption mobility (e.g. Jappelli
and Pistaferri (2006)) rely on them to analyze intra- or inter- generational mobility across
relative rankings in the distributions. In this paper, instead, we are interested in capturing
movements across earnings levels.

5

The model

The model is a partial-equilibrium, life-cycle, incomplete-markets model in the tradition of
Bewley (1977). There is no aggregate uncertainty.

5.1

Demographics

Each year, a positive measure of agents is born. People start life as workers and work until
retirement at age T ret . The population grows at rate n.
An agent of age t faces a positive probability of dying (1 − st ) by the end of the period,
where st denotes the one-period survival probability. Agents die with probability one by age
T.

5.2

Preferences and endowments

Preferences are time separable, with a constant discount factor β. The intra-period utility
is CRRA: u(ct ) = c1−σ
/(1 − σ).
t
Agents are endowed with one indivisible unit of labor which they supply inelastically at
zero disutility. Their earnings are subject to random shocks and follow the process described
by equations (1)-(3).

21

5.3

Markets and the government

Asset markets are incomplete. Agents can borrow up to an exogenous borrowing limit a and
can only invest in a risk-free asset at an exogenous rate of return r. There are no annuity
markets to insure against mortality risk. As a result, there is a positive flow of accidental
bequests in each period. We assume these are lost to the economy and thus are not received
by any individual or the government.
Retired individuals receive an after-tax pension p from the government until they die.
The pension is a function of the last earnings realization.

5.4

The household’s problem

In any given period, a agent of age t chooses consumption c and risk-free asset holdings for
the next period a0 , as a function of the relevant state vector. The optimal decision rules for
consumption and savings solve the dynamic programming problems described below.

The agent’s pension p enters the state vector because it is a function of the agent’s
earnings pre-retirement. The terminal value function W (T, a, p) is equal to zero (agents
do not derive utility from bequests).

5.5

The model calibration

The model period is one year. Agents enter the labor market at age 25. The retirement and
terminal ages are T ret = 60 and T = 85. The population growth rate n is set to 1.2% per
year. The survival probabilities st are from Bell, Wade and Goss (1992).
The coefficient of relative risk aversion is set to 2, a standard value. The risk-free rate
is 4% and the discount factor β is calibrated to match a wealth to income ratio of 3.1. It
equals 0.957 under the canonical earnings process and 0.939 under the nonlinear one.
We set the exogenous borrowing limit a to 12% of average disposable household earnings.
This represents the average credit card limit in the SCF in 1989 and 1992, the two years
within our sample period for which that information is available in the SCF.
As described in Section 2, our earnings processes are based on disposable earnings, hence
we do not explicitly include taxation in the model.19 In both cases, we impose the same
average income profile, which we estimate from our PSID sample.
We discretize the two earnings processes as follows. In the case of the canonical earnings
process, whose estimates we report in Table 1, we discretize the persistent component using
the modified version of the Rouwenhorst method for non-stationary processes proposed by
19

Appendix A provides more details about the earnings definition.

23

Fella et al. (2017). In the case of the nonlinear earnings process, we apply the procedure
described in Section 4. For both cases, we use 18 gridpoints for the persistent component
and 8 for the transitory component. In Appendix D we show that our results are robust to
increasing the number of gridpoints and alternative discretization procedures.
The Social Security benefit p is a function of the last realization of disposable earnings
yret = ηret + εret , which follows a fixed schedule of replacement rates. Namely, there is a 90%
replacement rate for the part of yret below 18% of average earnings, of 32% for the fraction
between 18% and 110% of average earnings, and 15 percent for the remainder. All benefits are
then (very slightly) scaled up proportionately so that a worker that makes average earnings
is entitled to a 45% replacement rate. The function is meant to mimic the US system and is
based on Kaplan and Violante (2010).

Consumption, wealth, and welfare implications

This section studies the model’s implications under the canonical and nonlinear earnings
processes and compares them to U.S. consumption data. To do so, we first analyze the growth
in consumption dispersion over the working life and then turn to measuring self-insurance
insurance as proposed by Blundell et al. (2008). Finally, we compare the implications of
these earnings processes for wealth inequality and welfare.

6.1

Consumption inequality over the working life

We start by studying the evolution of cross-sectional consumption dispersion over the life
cycle. Following Deaton and Paxson (1994) and Storesletten, Telmer and Yaron (2004b), it is
common to interpret its growth, relative to the growth of cross-sectional earnings dispersion,
as a measure of risk sharing. For reference, Figure 6 plots the cross-sectional dispersion of
consumption and earnings over the life cycle. The (solid) earnings variance profile is from
our PSID sample, while the dashed line plots the variance profile of nondurable consumption

is from the CEX 1980-2007 as in Heathcote, Perri and Violante (2010). Given the relatively
small sample size, we group observations in 5-year age groups. As it is well known, both
earnings and consumption inequality increase over the working life, but earnings inequality
increases substantially faster than consumption inequality from about age 40.
Because the increase in consumption inequality over the working life is informative about
people’s ability to insure against earnings risk, it provides a useful benchmark against which
to assess the ability of the model to capture the degree of insurability of earning shocks
in the data. Figure 7 reports the age profile of cross-sectional consumption dispersion for
both the CEX data and the model under, respectively, the canonical and nonlinear earnings
processes.20 . The series are normalized so that each starts at zero at age 27, which is the
midpoint of the first 5-year age group (25–29). The canonical earnings process fails to
match both the overall growth and the shape of the profile of consumption dispersion. Its
overall growth rate is more than double that in the data and its profile is monotonic and
roughly linear. Conversely, in the data, the age profile of consumption is significantly convex
between age 25 and 47. The nonlinear process, instead, matches well both the overall growth
in consumption dispersion and its convexity in the first part of the life cycle. The one part
20

We perform this comparison recalibrating beta so as to keep the wealth to income ratio constant across
earnings processes. Appendix D.5 shows that the profiles are very similar if we keep the discount factor
constant across processes instead.

that it misses is the flattening out after age 47.
The finding that the estimated richer earnings processes implies a profile of consumption
dispersion in line with the data is remarkable. Standard models with linear earnings processes (see Storesletten et al. (2004a)) generate a profile similar to the one implied by the
canonical earnings process in Figure 7, and thus overstate the rate of growth of consumption
dispersion, unless the process for earnings has an idiosyncratic deterministic time trend, or
Heterogeneous Income Profile (Guvenen, 2007; Primiceri and Van Rens, 2009). Intuitively,
heterogeneity in individual, life-cycle trend growth generates a substantially smaller rise in
consumption dispersion because the individual-specific trend growth is known to consumers
but not to the econometrician. Huggett et al. (2011) show that heterogeneity in earnings
growth rates can be also generated by the endogenous response of human-capital investment
over the life cycle to heterogeneity in initial human capital levels.
Our findings suggest a novel explanation: the age profile of cross-sectional consumption
dispersion can be generated by the response of saving to the richer earnings dynamics that we
consider, without resorting to heterogeneity in income profiles. It should also be noted that
allowing for heterogeneity in income profiles cannot generate (cfr. Guvenen, 2007; Primiceri
and Van Rens, 2009) the strong convexity that characterizes the consumption data (dotted
26

line in Figure 7).
As we have discussed in Section 3.1, our rich earnings process deviates from the canonical
linear process along three main dimensions: (1) age-dependence, (2) non-normality, and
(3) nonlinearity. To understand the contribution of each of these factors to the growth of
consumption dispersion over the life cycle, we conduct a series of counterfactual experiments,
simulating the model under progressively richer stochastic processes for earnings.
We start by restricting the functional form of the earnings process to be the sum of an
AR(1) plus a white noise component, as in the canonical process, but allowing for both
age-dependent persistence and variance of shocks (as in Karahan and Ozkan (2013)), as well
as non-normality of their distributions. Compared to the fully general nonlinear earnings
process, this one imposes linearity in ηi,t−1 ; namely, that persistence and other second and
higher conditional moments are independent of ηi,t−1 . We estimate this process on our
PSID data, following the procedure described in Section 3.1 for the nonlinear process, but
restricting the quantile function for the persistent component in equation (4) to be linear in
its past value.
To further disentangle the effect of the age dependence of persistence and variance from
that of non-normality, we perform two set of simulations using the restricted estimates that
we have just described. In the first one, we simulate earnings using the estimated persistence
and variances but drawing shocks from a normal distribution. In the second experiment, we
simulate earnings using the estimated distribution (i.e. quantile function), that also allows for
non-normality. We discretize each of the resulting processes using the method in Section 4.
The recalibrated value of the discount factor equals 0.939 in the economy with normal shocks
and 0.940 in the other one.
Figure 8 plots the cross-sectional variance profiles reported in Figure 7, with the addition
of the two profiles implied by (a) only age-dependence and (b) age-dependence together with
non-normality.
The solid line marked with circles in Figure 8 corresponds to the case of an age-dependent

linear process with normal innovations. Compared to the canonical case, allowing for age
dependence substantially improves the fit of consumption dispersion in the first part of the
life cycle, but counterfactually implies an even larger growth rate of consumption dispersion
from age 43 onwards. The net effect for the age-dependent earnings process is an overall rate
of growth in consumption dispersion between ages 25 and 60 that is three percentage points
higher than in the canonical case.
The intuition behind the above finding is the following. Allowing for age-dependence
implies that the estimated process for earnings matches the age-profile of the cross-sectional
earnings variance in the bottom right panel of Figure 3; namely, relatively flat until age
43 but growing at a rate substantially above its working-life average afterwards. The forces
underpinning this pattern are: (a) the U-shaped profile of the variance of the persistent component of earnings; and (b) a persistence below one that increases until age 45 but flattens
out afterwards (see Figure 3). Compared to the canonical process with a unit root and constant shock variance, the interaction of these two forces implies that self-insurance through
precautionary saving is more effective and, as a consequence, the growth in consumption
28

dispersion is lower until middle age. In the second half of the working life, though, the increase in the variance of the persistent earnings shocks reduces the ability to self-insure and
results in a substantial increase in consumption dispersion. This is confirmed by comparing
the age profile of average wealth reported in the left panel of Figure 9 under the canonical
(dashed curve) and age-dependent earnings process with normal shocks (solid curve with
circles). Though the aggregate wealth-to-earnings ratio is the same in the two economies,
average saving is higher before and lower after age 50 in the economy with age-dependent
earnings process.
We now turn to the linear process with the same (age-dependent) first and second moments as above but with non-normal innovations. The solid line marked with crosses in
Figure 8 plots the associated age profile of variance. Compared to the normal case, the rate
of growth of the consumption variance is everywhere lower. The difference is particularly
pronounced towards the end of the working life. To understand the mechanism at work, it
is important to understand the impact of negative skewness and kurtosis on precautionary
saving and the wealth distribution. Civale et al. (2016) study the issue in an Aiyagari economy and show that, everything else equal, negative skewness reduces both the cross-sectional
mean and dispersion of wealth while kurtosis increases both.
The effect of higher kurtosis is in line with intuition. By increasing the probability of
tail events higher kurtosis increases precautionary saving for all agents and therefore the
mean and variance of the wealth distribution. The effect of negative skewness, though, is
less intuitive. Basically, for a distribution to have higher negative skewness keeping the other
moments constant, some probability mass has to move towards the top of the distribution.
Wealthy agents are not sensitive to left skewness but, confronted with a higher probability of
positive shocks, save less. Conversely, agents who are close to the borrowing constraint are
more sensitive to skewness than to the higher probability of positive shocks and save more.
In the aggregate, the response of wealth-rich agents dominates that of the wealth-poor and
average wealth falls. More intuitively, so does the variance of wealth holdings. Comparing

of negative skewness and kurtosis hardly affects the life-cycle profile of average wealth (left
panel), but substantially reduces the rate of growth of the variance of wealth holdings (right
panel) compared to the case with normal shocks. This fall in wealth dispersion accounts
for the fall in consumption dispersion in Figure 8 when skewness and kurtosis of shocks are
introduced.
Finally, comparing the line marked with crosses and the solid line in Figure 8 shows that
allowing for nonlinearity brings the overall fit of life-cycle inequality substantially closer to
the data, compared to all of the other earnings processes considered. Figure 10 provides
some insight into the mechanism associated with the nonlinearity in earnings. It plots the
persistence (averaged over age) of the persistent earnings component by previous earnings and
current shock for both the age-dependent non-normal case (light surface) and the nonlinear
one (dark surface). By assumption persistence is constant in the former case. For individuals
with previous earnings realizations below the median, negative shocks (below the median)
increase persistence relative to the linear case, while positive shocks reduce it. This implies
that good shocks partially wipe out the memory of previous bad realizations while bad
shocks reinforce it. The average persistence of a bad previous realization is hardly affected

but, since the precautionary motive implies that saving responds more to downside than
upside risk, individuals with bad earnings realizations save more in the nonlinear case. The
nonlinearity is also present, though much less pronounced, for individuals with previous
earnings realizations in the top two deciles. For these, shocks below the second decile reduce
persistence, while shocks above it increase it, relative to the linear case. The increase in
average persistence, relative to the linear case, tends to reduce the saving response. On the
other hand, the fact that bad shocks reduce earnings more than linearly (reduce persistence)
increases precautionary saving. Overall, saving increases for agents with adverse realizations
of previous persistent earnings, while it falls for individuals with good previous earnings
realization. This is reflected in the flattening in the age-profile of the variance of wealth
holdings in the right panel of Figure 9. This fall in wealth dispersion accounts for the further
fall in the growth of consumption dispersion over the life cycle which brings it much closer
to the data, particularly for ages up to 50 (see Figure 8).
None of our earnings processes captures the flattening out in the variance of consumption
31

that we measure after age 47 because the variance of earnings in the data keeps increasing.
Our structural model misses two aspects of the data that could be important in this regard.
The first one is early retirement. For retirees, income is mainly composed of Social Security
payments and does not vary much. Thus, consumption is no longer exposed to earnings
fluctuations and medical expense risk is not very high until well into retirement age, as
shown by De Nardi, French and Jones (2010). The second one is the role of durables and
housing, that become substantial by that age and might affect both measured consumption
(we only look at nondurable consumption) and one’s ability to self-insure.

6.2

Measuring self-insurance against earnings shocks

An alternative, and possibly more intuitive, measure of self-insurance is related to the extent
of pass through from shocks to disposable earnings onto consumption. Blundell et al. (2008)
propose estimating consumption insurance coefficients on persistent and transitory earning
shocks by positing the following equation

(11)

∆cit = (1 − ψ p )νit + (1 − ψ tr )εit + ξit ,

where νit = ηit −E[ηit |t, ηi,t−1 ] denotes the innovation to the persistent component of earnings
and εit the transitory component. The insurance coefficients with respect to persistent (ψ p )
and transitory (ψ tr ) shocks

(12)

ψp = 1 −

cov(∆cit , εit )
cov(∆cit , νit )
, ψ tr = 1 −
var(νit )
var(εit )

capture the fraction of the variance of either type of shock that does not translate into
movements in consumption. Similarly, one can compute age-specific insurance coefficients
ψtp , ψttr where moments are computed only over agents of age t.
To compute the insurance coefficients implied by our model, we simulate a panel of
working lives under both the benchmark and nonlinear processes and compute the associated
32

consumption cit and insurance coefficients in equation (12) on the simulated data.
Computing the coefficients in equation (12) within the model is straightforward since the
shocks are observable. In contrast, estimating them from the data requires identifying the two
types of earning shocks at the individual level. Blundell et al. (2008) propose an identification
strategy under the assumption that earnings follow the canonical linear process (1)-(3). The
estimators for the insurance coefficients based on the BPP methodology are given by

, ψBP
.
P = 1−
cov(∆yit , yi,t+1 − yi,t−2 )
cov(∆yi,t , ∆yi,t+1 )

As pointed out by Kaplan and Violante (2010), comparing the coefficients in equation (13)
estimated within the model to the estimates in Blundell et al. (2008) conveys information
on the degree of shock insurability in the model relative to the data.
The coefficients in equation (13), though, may provide biased estimates of the true coefficients in equation (12) to the extent that the identification assumption on which they are
based is violated. The assumption can be violated for two reasons. First, if earnings do not
follow the canonical linear process in equation (1)-(3). This is obviously true in the more
flexible cases we consider. Second, as pointed out by Kaplan and Violante (2010), even if
p
earnings follow a canonical linear process the ψBP
P estimator may be biased whenever con-

sumption does not equal permanent income, as is the case in the presence of a precautionary
saving motive.21 For this reason, we compute both types of coefficients. Table 2 reports
their values under the alternative income processes.
Columns 1 and 2 in Table 2 report the coefficients in equation (13). As a reference, the
first row reports the estimates by Blundell et al. (2008)—respectively 0.36 for permanent and
0.95 for transitory shocks—on the PSID using similar data to ours.22 The corresponding
21

Formally, the bias is present whenever present consumption responds to past persistent income changes,
which implies that cov(∆cit , yi,t+1 −yi.t−2 ) is a biased estimator of cov(∆cit , νit ). Kaplan and Violante (2010)
show that this is indeed the case in a life-cycle model similar to ours with a canonical earnings process and
occasionally-binding borrowing constraints.

Blundell et al. (2008) conduct their analysis using disposable household earnings for continuously married
coupled headed by a male head.

Process/Coefficients

Table 2: Insurance coefficients

values for the model, when earnings follow the canonical earnings process, are 0.13 and
0.89, which confirms the finding by Kaplan and Violante (2010) that the extent of selfinsurance of permanent earnings shocks implied by the model is substantially lower than
the degree of insurance in the data. On the other hand, the estimates for the model with a
nonlinear earnings process imply an insurance coefficient for persistent shocks of 0.43 which
is substantially more in line with, and even marginally larger than, the BPP estimate in the
first row.
From a qualitative perspective, this result is very much in line with our findings in Section
6 that agents are more able to self-insure against income fluctuations when earnings follow
the nonlinear process than in the canonical case. Interestingly, our finding that allowing for
a richer earnings process implies a substantially different estimate of the insurance coefficient
for persistent shocks is confined to disposable household earnings. Using the same earnings
process we use here, Arellano et al. (2017) estimate an average insurance coefficient for
persistent shocks to pre-tax household earnings between 0.6 and 0.7 which is in line with an
estimate of 0.69 in Blundell et al. (2008) under the identifying assumption that earnings follow
the canonical process. As discussed in Blundell et al. (2008), the nearly double magnitude
of the insurance coefficients with respect to pre-tax rather than disposable earnings is due to
the of insurance implied by the tax and transfer system.
Turning to the insurance coefficient for transitory shocks in column 2, it may seem sur34

prising that it is higher under the canonical than under the nonlinear earnings process. As
pointed out in Kaplan and Violante (2010), though, the intuition is that the increased insurability of persistent shocks induces households to shift the use of savings from the smoothing
of transitory shocks to the smoothing of persistent shocks.
Columns 3 and 4 in Table 2 report the estimates of the true insurance coefficients in
equation (12) within the model. Comparing them to the BPP estimates in columns 1 and
2 reveals that the downward bias of the insurance coefficient for persistent shocks implied
by the BPP procedure is sizeable (0.13 against 0.31) in the case of the canonical income
process but small (0.43 against 0.46) for the nonlinear process. The intuition is that, as
pointed out by Kaplan and Violante (2010), the bias is exacerbated in an economy in which
the borrowing constraint is occasionally binding. As discussed above, when earnings follow
the nonlinear process shocks are more insurable, and precautionary saving larger. For this
reason, the economy spends less time close to the borrowing constraint and the bias is lower.
Finally, the last two lines reports the same coefficient for the case with age dependence
and normal shocks and the one that also allows for non-normality. Comparing the three set
of estimates reveals that the feature that drives the better match of the insurance coefficient
for persistent shock estimated by BPP is essentially the age dependence of the earnings
process. This is consistent with the finding in Karahan and Ozkan (2013) that the (true)
insurance coefficient for persistent shocks in a life-cycle economy with an age-dependent
earnings process with normal shocks is 0.38.23
While Table 2 reports the average insurance coefficients, Figure 11 plots the true insurance
coefficient for persistent shocks ψtp at each age. The coefficients are increasing with age,
as: (a) wealth is accumulated; and (b) the fall in the residual working life reduces the
effective shock persistence. The degree of insurability at all ages but the last working age
is substantially higher under the nonlinear earnings process than under the canonical one.
23

The earnings process used by Karahan and Ozkan (2013) is similar to our age-dependent process with
normal shocks. Their estimate of 0.38 for the true coefficient ψ p is in the ballpark of our estimate of 0.46 in
Table 2.

Table 3: Wealth distribution

For the same reason, the age profile of the coefficients is substantially flatter in the former
case. In line with the discussion above, most of the difference is due to the age-dependence
of earnings. It is only from age 40 onwards that the coefficients are marginally higher under
the nonlinear process than under the age-dependent earnings process with normal shocks.

6.3

Wealth

Table 3 compares the implied wealth distribution of the canonical and nonlinear earnings
processes with data from the U.S 1989 SCF (Kuhn and Rı́os-Rull, 2015).
As known in the literature (see Quadrini and Rı́os-Rull (2014), Cagetti and De Nardi
(2008), and De Nardi and Fella (2017)), the model with a canonical earnings process is
36

unable to generate the substantial level of wealth concentration that we observe in the data.
For instance, the top 1% of agents holds about 30% of total wealth in the data, while the
corresponding share is only holds 9% in the model. Comparing the second and third rows in
the table reveals that allowing for nonlinear earnings does not improve the fit of the wealth
the distribution. If anything it marginally reduces the degree of wealth concentration at
the top.24 One may be concerned that this may be due to the nature of the PSID data,
which top-codes earnings and does not oversample the rich. However, De Nardi et al. (2016)
conduct a similar exercise using synthetically-generated W2 Social Security Administration
tax data, and find similar results for the concentration of wealth at the top. As pointed out
by De Nardi and Fella (2017), non-homothetic preferences for bequests, entrepreneurship,
and medical-expense risk are important for life-cycle models to be able to account for top
wealth concentration.

6.4

Welfare

The differences in the evolution of the variance of log consumption and the pass-through of
income shocks to consumption show that income risk affects households in a different way
in the two economies. A natural question is to which extent these differences affect welfare.
To measure welfare, Table 4 displays the constant fraction of consumption that households
are willing to give up to live in a world with no income uncertainty; i.e., a world where
earnings are equal to the common and deterministic average earnings profile. We compute
this measure under the veil of ignorance (before people enter the labor market and draw the
first earnings realization) and, for comparability, we keep the discount factor the same for
both processes fixing it at its calibrated value for the nonlinear process.
The nonlinear process features larger variance and lower persistence of persistent shocks
that, as we have discussed in Section 6.1, improve shock insurability, but also negative
skewness and high kurtosis, as well as nonlinear persistence. Vice versa in the canonical
24

We target a wealth to income ratio of 3.1, but this has little effect on wealth concentration.

model, the lower variance of shocks at all ages after the first one is counteracted by their
high persistence (unit root) and the higher variance of the initial condition. The net effect
of all these forces is that overall risk is higher under the canonical process. In particular,
households would be willing to give up 28.2 per cent of their consumption in every state to
eliminate earnings risk under the canonical earnings process compared to 26.1 per cent under
the nonlinear earnings process.
In order to understand the respective contribution of the various features of our rich
earnings process we have also computed the welfare cost under the two intermediate earnings
processes considered in sections 6.1 and 6.2. The results are reported the third and fourth
row of Table 4. They show that the lower welfare costs of earnings risk relative to the
canonical process are all due to the age-dependence of second moments. Allowing only for
age-dependence reduces the welfare costs of earnings risk by 4 percentage points, from 28.2
to 24.3 per cent, relative to the canonical process. Introducing, non-normality lowers welfare
by one percentage point, relative to the normal age-dependent case, while allowing also for
non-linearity reduces it by an additional percentage point.

Conclusions

We estimate a richer stochastic process for household disposable earnings featuring a transitory and persistent component and allowing for age-dependence, non-normality and nonlinearity. We use a standard life-cycle model with incomplete markets to compare the implications of our richer process to those of canonical permanent/transitory linear process with
38

age-independent, normally-distributed shocks. Our main findings are as following. Compared to the canonical process, the richer process implies a much better fit of the growth in
cross-sectional consumption dispersion over the life cycle and a degree of self-insurance of
persistent earnings shocks in line with the empirical estimates in Blundell et al. (2008). It
also implies smaller welfare costs of earnings fluctuations. In terms of wealth inequality, we
find that the two earnings processes have similar implications, including at the upper tail of
the wealth distribution.

Appendix: PSID data

We use PSID data to estimate both the canonical and the nonlinear earnings processes.
In this Appendix we briefly describe the PSID, our sample selection criterion, the precise
variable definition we use and the details of the estimation of the canonical earnings process.

A.1

The PSID

The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) follows a large number of U.S. households
over time and reports information about their demographic characteristics and sources of
income. The PSID was initially composed of two major subsamples. The first of them, the
SRC (Survey Research Center) or core subsample, was designed to be representative of the
U.S. population and is a random sample itself, including over 18,000 individuals living in
5,000 households. The second, the SEO (Survey of Economic Opportunity) subsample, was
created to study the characteristics of the most deprived households. Later, Immigrant and
Latino subsamples were also added to the PSID.
From 1968 to 1997, the survey was yearly. After 1997, it started having a biennial
structure. We only consider the SRC or core subsample because the SEO oversamples the
poor. After dropping the SEO and Latino samples we are left with a random sample, which
makes computations simpler since weights are not needed (Haider, 2001).25

A.2

Sample selection

Since the model period is one year, we restrict ourselves to the yearly part of the survey, and
focus on the years 1968-1992. We have dropped the 1993-1997 period because there was a
major redesign of the survey in 1993. This affected the method through which information
was collected, with the introduction of computer-based surveys, and the definitions of some
variables we use (for instance, asset income of other family members was no longer available,
25

It must be taken into account that the weighting of our final dataset can be affected by attrition and by
the fact that we are neglecting observations of yearly income under $ 1500 (expressed in 2015 dollars).

45

and wife labor income was redefined). We have verified that results are not sensitive to
including these five years.
Following standard practice in the literature, we only consider individuals between ages
25 and 60. We consider all households, whether or not male-headed. This differs from many
other papers, but follows e.g. Krueger, Mitman and Perri (2016).
We deflate values to 2013 dollars, and only keep observations with earnings (as defined
below) above $1500. This is also in accordance with standard practice in the literature,
where observations below a minimum earnings threshold are dropped (De Nardi (2004) or
Guvenen et al. (2016), for instance).

A.3

Income definition

For the estimation of our earnings process, we use after-tax equivalized household earnings.
We first construct nonfinancial pre-tax household earnings using PSID data. Then, we
estimate a tax function to obtain after-tax earnings. Finally, we regress earnings on the
number of family members for the purposes of equivalization.
We now describe each of these three steps in detail.

A.3.1

Nonfinancial pre-tax income

We construct nonfinancial pre-tax income closely following Guvenen and Smith (2014). The
procedure is based on subtracting all asset income from total family income.
Before 1976, asset income was not directly available in the survey. Therefore, we take
total family income, subtract head and wife taxable income (which includes labor and asset
income) and then add back labor earnings for head and wife independently.
From 1976, we consider all the available measures of asset income. These include farm
income, business income, rent and interests, with the addition of gardening and roomers
income (from 1978), and asset income of family members other than head and wife (from
1984).
46

We keep top-coded observations, but drop the very small number (8) of households who,
probably due to measurement error, would have nonfinancial income below zero.

A.3.2

Tax function

We obtain disposable labor income by subtracting an estimated measure of taxes on labor
income from nonfinancial pre-tax income.
We first compute the total amount of income taxes paid by households by adding up the
federal income tax variable (which is available in the PSID until 1990) with a constructed
measure of payroll (FICA and Medicare) taxes, which is based on applying the historical
rates and caps to labor earnings of husband and wife independently.
We then separate taxes on labor and asset income by running a regression of this total
tax measure on nonfinancial income and its square, and asset income and its square. This
also follows Guvenen and Smith (2014). The estimated coefficients allow us to predict taxes
on labor income26 , which we subtract from nonfinancial pre-tax income to get after-tax labor
income.

A.3.3

Equivalization

We then equivalize after-tax nonfinancial disposable income by running a regression of earnings on the number of family members and keeping the residuals. We also extract year fixed
effects.

A.4
A.4.1

Estimating the canonical and nonlinear earnings processes
Estimating the nonlinear earnings process

To finally implement the Arellano et al. (2017) procedure, we create a sample with all sets of
subsequent three-year observations (without replacement: once an observation in the PSID
26

We use the coefficients estimated in the sample 1968-1990 to predict taxes on labor income for the
period 1968-1992, given that the PSID federal income tax variable is not available for the last two years of
our sample.

47

sample is in a 3-year set in our sample we drop it). This implies that we are also dropping
all of those households that do not have three consecutive valid income observations in the
PSID.
We then follow the procedure described in Section 3.2 and the discretization explained
in Section 4.

A.4.2

Estimating the canonical earnings process

In Storesletten et al. (2004a) (and in many other papers in the literature, e.g. Krueger et al.
(2016)) the earnings process is estimated by fitting a parametric process to the variance of
earnings profile that we observe in the data. The standard way is to compute the variance
of earnings by age-cohort-year cells, and then get the coefficients of a regression of those
on either age and year or age and cohort. For consistence with our approach and with the
consumption data we rely on, we use the one that controls for year effects (see discussion
below).
We follow a GMM procedure in which we minimize the distance of the estimated process
to the profile of variances and first-order autocovariances of earnings over the life cycle27 .
The weighting matrix is the identity matrix.
The canonical earnings process in equations (1)-(3) implies (for t > 1)

Appendix: Computation of the variances of log earnings and log consumption.

We estimate the canonical earnings process described in Section 3.3 by matching the variance
and first autocovariance of log earnings.
To compute the variance of log earnings, which we report in Figure 3, we use the procedure
described in Kaplan (2012) (Appendix C.3), controlling for year effects, with our PSID data.
More specifically, we take log disposable and equivalized labor income ỹit , where i indexes
the household and t is the age of its head, and run the regression

(B.1)

ỹit = βt0 Dt + βd0 Dd + yit ,

where Dt and Dd are matrices with columns corresponding to a full set of age and year (date)
dummies, respectively. The vectors βt and βd are the corresponding coefficients and yit the
earnings residuals.28
We compute the variance of yit by age group as

where D is the number of years in the dataset, and Nd,t is the numerosity of each age-year
cell. This implies that the variance of earnings at age t weighs equally the corresponding

As described in Appendix A, we use the earnings residuals from equations (B.1) to estimate our earnings
processes.

We also compute the variance of yit by age group controlling for cohort instead of year

where K(t) is the number of cohorts containing individuals of age t and Nk,t is the numerosity
of each cohort-age cell.29 This approach weighs the conditional variances from each cohort
equally.
Under both approaches, we obtain very similar age profiles (Figure B.1) and parameter
estimates for the canonical process (Table B.1).

Turning to consumption, we compute the variance of log consumption using data from the
CEX for the period 1980-2007. Nondurable consumption includes food, clothing, gasoline,
household operation, transportation, medical care, recreation, tobacco, and education.
29

The residuals used in equations (B.2) and (B.3) are the same. Given that year, age and cohort are
linearly dependent, the residuals from equation (B.1) are the same that would obtain from projecting onto
age and cohort dummies.

Table B.1: Estimates for the canonical earnings process: cohort vs. year effects

We compute the variance of log consumption following the same procedures that we
use for the variance of log earnings. Namely, we deal with year effects using the method
proposed by Kaplan (2012) and equivalize consumption with a regression on the number of
family members. We have also applied this procedure to OECD-equivalized consumption
data and verified that it yields very similar results to Heathcote, Perri and Violante (2010)
when they control for year effects.

Appendix: Robust measures of skewness and kurtosis

Figure C.1 represents a robust measure of skewness (Kelley’s skewness) and a robust measure
of kurtosis (Crow-Siddiqui kurtosis) for male pre-tax earnings in the W2, and for both male
pre-tax and household after-tax earnings in the PSID.
Equations C.1 and C.2 show that these measures are computed taking into account
specific percentiles of the distribution of earnings changes and, as such, are robust to the
effect of outliers. The inspection of C.1 shows that all of the main features highlighted in
Section 2 are still present in these more robust measures.

Appendix: Fit of the earnings process to the data
and robustness of the discretization

To sum up, our procedure for earnings requires two steps:
1. Apply the Arellano et al. (2017) decomposition to PSID data to obtain the persistent
52

and transitory components of earnings. This is described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
2. Discretize the simulated persistent component and transitory component using an agedependent Markov chain to obtain the discretized persistent and discretized transitory
components. This is described in Section 4.
In this appendix we show that (1) the central features of the data that we are interested
in replicating are preserved by the discretized process that we use in the structural model
and (2) that our main findings are robust to increasing the number of grid points for the
two components of earnings. We also report the results for consumption inequality and
self-insurance in the case in which the discount factor β is kept constant across earnings
processes.

D.1.1

Fit of the earnings process to the data
Conditional moments of earnings changes

Figure D.1 plots the second, third, and fourth standardized moments of earnings changes.
The left panel refers to our PSID sample (and thus replicates the bottom panel of Figure
1. The central panel displays the same measures computed on earnings (i.e. the sum of
the persistent and transitory components), simulated using the estimated nonlinear process
associated with the quantile functions in (6)-(8). The right panel reports the corresponding
moments computed on earnings simulated using our discrete approximation of such continuous processes.
The polynomial quantile functions and their discretization smooths the skewness and
kurtosis graphs (which are very noisy and affected by outliers). Yet, the main patterns of the
data (negative skewness, large kurtosis and variation over previous earnings) are preserved.
Figure D.2 zooms in on just the estimated persistent component of earnings and compares
its features of the persistent component (top) with those its discretized counterpart. It
suggests that our flexible discretization, despite only having 18 bins per age group, captures

these feature of the data.
Figure D.3 conducts the same comparison for the estimated transitory component and
shows that our discretization reproduces the observed age-dependence, high negative skewness, and large kurtosis. The 8-gridpoints discretization (top panel) generates much larger
kurtosis than that of a normal distribution but falls a bit short of that in the data because
it cannot accurately capture the effect of outliers. A finer, 16-gridpoints, discretization (bottom panel), which has additional bins on the tails, does match the kurtosis in the data. In
Appendix D.2, we describe this alternative discretization more in detail and we show it does
not make a difference for our results from our structural model.

to earnings simulated using the discretized process (persistent plus transitory component),
the bottom left panel to the estimated persistent component, and the bottom right panel to
its discretized counterpart. The discretization makes the graph for nonlinear persistence less
smooth, but it preserves most of its important features. Namely, earnings are less persistent
for high earners who receive a very bad shock and and low earners who receive a very good
shock, while they are most persistent for high earners who receive a good shock and low
earners who receive a bad shock.

Unconditional moments of persistent earnings

Figure D.5 plots the unconditional moments of the persistent earnings distribution, as opposed to the conditional moments of earnings changes in the previous sections. Our discretization captures very well their levels and variations by age, but similarly to Figure D.3
we need a finer discretization to match the very high levels of kurtosis in the data. We
describe this finer discretization in Section D.2, where we also show that it generates very

Robustness to the number of earnings gridpoints

In our main results, at each age, we discretize the persistent component of earnings with 18
gridpoints and the transitory one with 8 gridpoints, as described in Section 4. These are the
smallest grid sizes beyond which adding additional grid points makes little difference for the
economic implications discussed in Section 6.
In this section, we report results on simulating our model with finer grids and show that
our results are robust to these changes. The finer discretization has the advantage that it
fits some moments of the data better (like the unconditional moments of the transitory and
persistent earnings shocks, as seen in Figures D.3 and D.5).
Figure D.6 and Table D.1 show the growth in the variance of log consumption and the
BPP coefficients under a finer discretization for the transitory component. More specifically,
the transitory component is divided into, respectively, 8 gridpoints as in our main results
(corresponding to the bottom 2.5%, next 2.5%, next 5%, next 40%, next 40%, next 5%, next
2.5% and top 2.5%) and 16 gridpoints (bottom 0.1%, next 0.4%, next 0.5%, next 2%, next
2%, next 5%, four quintiles, next 5%, next 2%, next 2%, next 0.5%, next 0.4% and finally
top 0.1%). The differences between the 8- and 16- gridpoints specification are very small.

Alternative discretization of the canonical process

As described in Section 5.5, for our main results we discretize the canonical process using
the modified version of the Rouwenhorst method for non-stationary processes proposed by
Fella et al. (2017). Here we show that our findings that the nonlinear process provides a
substantially better fit are not due to using to different discretizations for the canonical and
the nonlinear processes. To this effect, we discretize the canonical process by taking the
parametric estimates in Table 1, simulating a panel of earnings histories and applying the
same the same age-varying Markov chain procedure as we followed for the NL process.
Figure D.8 and Table D.3 show the implied consumption profiles and BPP coefficients.
Both discretizations give rise to qualitatively similar results. Under the alternative discretization, the canonical earnings process overshoots the growth in the variance of log consumption
over the life-cycle by an even larger amount.

Results without persistent-transitory decomposition

In Section 3.1 we describe the flexible earnings process that we estimate, which is based
in the persistent-transitory decomposition proposed by Arellano et al. (2017). However, an
alternative, computationally less costly choice is to apply directly our Markov-chain flexible
discretization method to the raw data. Figure D.9 and Table D.4 provide the results of
applying that simpler method to our PSID sample.
Neglecting the persistent-transitory decomposition implies a substantial underestimation
of the growth of the variance of log consumption over the life cycle and, consistently, an
overestimation of the ability of households to self-insure against earnings shocks. This can
partially reflect the existence of measurement error in the PSID, and provides further support to the procedure we follow in our main results. With administrative data, where the
measurement error issue is smaller, we also the expect differences in implications when we
take our the transitory shock to be smaller.

Results with a common discount factor

The profiles for the variance of log consumption and insurance coefficients that we report in
Section 6 are computed by recalibrating the discount factor β to keep the wealth to income

ratio identical in the economy under the canonical process and the economy under the NL
process. On the other hand, to perform the welfare computations we keep β constant so
that both economies can be comparable. Here we report the consumption and insurance
results that correspond to this latter case. Namely, we fix β at its calibrated value for the
NL process and then estimate the model for the canonical process. Given that the calibrated
value for β is higher for the canonical process, there is less accumulation of wealth in this
economy.
Figure D.10 reports the associated consumption inequality profile, which is very similar
to that of the canonical process with a recalibrated discount factor, if not slightly worse.
Table D.5 reports the insurance coefficients. The true coefficients ψ p and ψ tr are slightly
smaller than in the case with a recalibrated β, which reflects that self-insurance is lower in
an economy with less wealth accumulation. The BPP estimate of the insurance coefficients

P is, like we argued in Section 6.2, downward biased in an

economy where the borrowing constraint is occasionally binding. With a lower discount
factor, the borrowing constraint is more frequently binding, and the bias becomes so large
that the coefficient is estimated to be negative.
