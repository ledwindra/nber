Interest Rate Expectations Versus Forward Rates:
Evidence From an Expectations Survey
BENJAMIN M. FRIEDMAN

economists have developed a substantial
rates
literature relating the forward interest
implied by currently prevailing rates
to
market
on debts of differing maturity
participants' expectations of interest
in
the
future.
Hicks
that
rates
suggested
implied forward rates might differ from
the corresponding expected future rates by a liquidity premium, or term premium,
and more recently Stiglitz [19] and others have formalized how market participants' risk aversion would give rise to such a premium. While in principle the
premium could be either positive or negative, the usual upward slope of the yield
curve suggests a positive premium that itself varies positively with the debt's
term to maturity. Kessel [10] subsequently suggested that the premium for a
given maturity might vary with real economicactivity, and Culbertson [2] argued
that relative outside debt supply quantitiesshould als' affect the premium. More
recently Nelson [16] offered an explanation for the premium even in the absence
of risk aversion, and Friedman [5] related changes in the premium to shifts in
wealth ownership among heterogenous investors.
An accompanying empirical literature has repeatedly tested each of these
various hypotheses about forward rates and expected future rates, but usually
with somewhat inconclusive results. A key reason for the weakness of much of
this empirical literature has been the absence of independentinformation about
market participants'expectations. Not surprisingly, the very early attemptsbased
on the assumption of perfect foresight were most unsuccessful and this approach
quickly went out of fashion. The traditionalprocedure since then has been either
to apply the Hicks-Lutz theory to derive expectations proxies from the same
term-structure data that generate the forward rates, or to use some other device
like autoregressive or 'rational' expectations proxies. In either case, any hypothesis submitted to statistical testing is necessarily a joint hypothesis embodying
both the relation of forward rates to expectations and the formationof expectations themselves. Failure of the hypothesis to conform to the data may then
indicate rejection of the proposition relating forward rates to expectations, or
rejection of the identifying restrictions imposed to derive the expectations proxy

The object of this paper is to test several familiar hypotheses about the

rate expectations, using the one ongoing systematic survey that samples market
participants' expectations. The substitution of survey data for overidentified
constructions removes the principal source of ambiguity that has plagued much
of the earlier empirical literature of the term structure. Nevertheless, because of
limitations in the available data, it is possible to perform these tests only for the
very short end of the maturity spectrum.
Section I briefly describes the nature of the interest rate expectations survey
and the calculation of the forward rate series from observed term structure data.
Sections lI—V present the results of testing the hypotheses that the implied term
premium is zero on average (II), that it varies systematically with interest rate
levels (III), that it varies with outside asset supplies (IV), and that it varies with
economic activity (V). Section VI summarizes the findings of these tests and
discusses their implications.
I. The Survey Data and the Forward Rates
The Goldsmith-Nagan Bond andMoney Market Letter is a biweekly publication
circulated widely among professional financial market participants including
investors, traders and underwriters. Since September, 1969, the Goldsmith-Nagan
Letter has conducted a quarterly survey of the interest rate expectations of a
selected panel of approximately fifty of its subscribers who are known to the
publisher to be market professionals. The survey, conducted at the end of each
calendar quarter, asks respondents to indicate their respective point expectations
for each of a set of interest rates as of the close of the last business day of the
coming quarter and of the quarter following. The two expectations series exploited
here, below denoted RE1 and RE2, consist of the pairs of means of the survey
respondents' simultaneously held one-quarter-ahead and two-quarters-ahead expectations of the 3-month U.S. Treasury bill rate.'
Following Hicks, the forward rate of interest implied for one-period debts one
period hence is

F,=(l+R2)_l
(1 R1)

(1)

where R1 and R2 are the currently prevailing (spot) interest rates on one-period
and two-period debts, respectively. Similarly, the forward rate implied for oneperiod debts two periods hence is
F2

(1±R3)3 —
(1 -i-.R2)2

1

(2)

where R3 is analogously the prevailing rate on three-period debts. The forward
rates used below are constructed according to (1) and (2) from the observed
market rates on 3-, 6- and 9-month Treasury bills as of the close of the last
business day of each calendar quarter.
See Friedman [61 for an analysis of the statistical properties of these expectations as well as those
for five other interestrates. See Prell [181 for a more detailed description of the survey data.

equivalent yield basis.

II. Is There a Term Premium?
Whether implied forward interest rates are or are not identical to expected future
interest rates has been a major question in monetary economics, for several good
reasons. At the theoretical level the presence or absence of a term premium bears
importantly on the appropriateness of treating all interest-bearing assets as
perfect substitutes, a key turning point for a number of fundamental issues in
monetary theory.2 At the empirical level, it is necessary to face the same question
in determining how far to disaggregate among securities in
estimating asset
demand behavior. At the policy level, the usefulness of debt management
policy
(or the surrogate "Operation Twist" in the early 1960s), or the appropriateness of
the old "bills only" approach to open market operations, again depends on asset
substitutability properties to which a term premium (or its absence) provides
important clues.3
Among the early tests for a term premium between interest rates on debts of
different maturities, perhapsthe best known is Meiselinan's [12] work which used
a simple error-learning hypothesis to proxy the unobservable expectations. Meiselman was unable to reject the hypothesis of no term premium.
By contrast,
subsequent investigations of the term structure using more general expectations
mechanisms—for example, the work of Modigliani mid Sutch [14],
and Shiller [13], and Nelson [lG]—typically has found evidence of a Modigliani
term premium. Indeed, among recent studies, even in those that find nosignificant
evidence
of a significant premium the conclusion often turns less on the mean estimate
than on its standarderror.4
Given the survey expectations data and the implied forward rate series described in Section I, it is straightforward to define the term premium
relationship
between 6- and 3-month bills, and between 9- and 6-month bills,
respectively, as

TP1—F1-R
TP2 = F2 RE2.

-

In words, TP1 is the difference between the implied forward rate on one-period
debts one period hence and the one-period rate that market participants
expect
to prevail one period hence; and TP2 is the analogous difference for one-period

debts two periods hence.
The sample-period means and standard deviations of the two term premium
series are respectively m(TP1) = 0.56%, m(TP2) = 0.59%, s(TP1) = 0.45%,
s(TP2)
= 0.68%. On the basis of this simple evidence,
therefore,it is impossible to reject
for example,Tobin [201, Brunner and Meltrer [1] and Friedman [31.
See, for example,Tobin [211 and Modiglianiand Sutch[14].
4llamburgerand Platt [8], for example, using data for 3-month and 6-month U.S. Treasury bills,
estimated the equivajent of —o in (4) below to be 0.30%. but with t-statistic
only 1.1.

The Journal of Finance -

term premium despite mean estimates that are
relatively large in comparison to prevailing interest rate levels.5 From (1) and (3),
for example, TP1 = 0.56% means that 6-month rates will exceed 3-month rates by
approximately 0.28%, even if the current 3-month rate is expected to continue to
prevail three months hence. Similarly, TP2 = 0.59% means that 9-month rates
will exceed 6-month rates by approximately 0.20% even if the current 3-month
rate is expected to continue to prevail both three months hence and six months
hence.
Simply looking at calculated means and standard deviations, however, is an
incomplete way to test the hypothesis that the term premium as defined in (3) is
zero. The proper test follows from relating the corresponding forward rates and
expectations in the form
the null hypothesis of a zero

Fia+f3REL±u,

(4)

where u is a zero-mean finite-variance disturbance term which is uncorrelated
with REt. The "pure expectations theory" of the term structurethen corresponds
to the null hypothesis
Ho:

(a, /3) = (0,

1)

(5)

(as well as lack of serial correlation in ui).
The results of estimating (4) by ordinary least squares for the two data sets are
F1 = —0.74 + 1.21R5 (R2
(0.36) (0.06)
F2 = —1.66 + 1.36RE2
(0.73) (0.12)

= .94, SE = 0.39%, DW= 1.45)

(J2 =

.82,

SE = 0.61%, DW= 1.32)

where R2 is the coefficient of determination adjustedfor degrees of freedom, SE
is the standard error of estimate, DW is the Durbin-Watson statistic, and the
number in parentheses beneath each coefficient is its standard error. In both
cases the results not only warrant rejecting the joint null hypothesis (5) but also
(using a two-tailed t-test at the .05 significance level) warrant rejecting separately
the individual hypotheses a = 0 and /3 = 1.6 Hence it is clear that the inability to
rejectthe hypotheses m ( TP,) = 0, as noted above, is due to the implicit imposition
of /3 = 1, a restriction which the data strongly reject. Indeed, in both data sets the
estimated /3 value is sufficiently greater than unity to render the estimated a

value negative.
In sum, the evidence sharply rejects the "pure expectations" hypothesis that
the market simply prices debts of different maturities so as to satisfy the HicksLutz condition with no term premium included.7
The sample-period means of the observed interest rates on 3-, 6-, and 9-month bills are m(R1) =
= 6.44%, and m(R3) = 6.56%.
6
In addition, the results for F2 reject at the .05 level the hypothesis of lack of serial correlation in

6.13%, m(R2)
U2.

An alternative interpretation of the data would be to take the forward rates as given and th ask
whether the survey respondents, in forming their expectations, merely take the forward rate as the
rate most likely to prevail. The data also warrant rejecting the null hypothesis (5) in the alternative
formulation RE o + [IF, + u,.

III. Does the Term PremiumVary with Interest Rates?
The rejection not only of a = 0 but also of $ = 1 in (4) immediately suggests that
the term premium for a given maturity varies with the prevailing level of interest
rates. Kessel first argued that the term premium is nonconstant, and, among
subsequent more formal models of the term premium, several provide rationales
for expecting the term premium to vary (usually positively) with interest rates.
The results of estimating by ordinary least squares the relationship
TI?, = a + 131R1

+ $2R,,,_1 + u,

are

(0.12)
(0.11)

(R2 =

.27,

SE = 0.55%, DW= 1.74).

In both cases, at least one of the pair ($i, $2) is significantly different from zero
at the .05 level individually, and the associated F-statisticswarrant rejecting the
null hypothesis
Ho: /3 = $2 0
at the .01 level. Analogous regressions of TP1 on R2, aiid TP2 on R1, yield roughly
similar results.
In sum, the evidence strongly indicates that the m'irket not only prices debts
of different maturities so as to set forward rates not equal to expected future
interest rates but also does so in a way that systematically varies with current
interest rate levels.

IV. Does the Term PremiumVary with Outside Asset Supplies?
In theories of asset pricing based on the equation of choice-theoretic market
demands to exogenous outside supplies, the relationships among market-clearing
asset prices (yields) typically vary with relative asset supplies.8 Under strong
conditions describing market participants' willingness to substitute one asset for
another, however, relative yields may be invariant to relative asset supplies.
Given the government's ability to determine the maturity structure of the
outstanding public debt via either debt management policy (the Treasury) or
open market operations (the Federal Reserve), it is not surprising that several
contributions to the previous empirical literature of the term structure have
attempted to find evidence of an effect due to relative supplies of government
securities of different maturities.9
8

For the explicit derivation of such a model given the assumption of constant relative risk aversion,
see Friedman [5].
See, for example, Modigliani and Sutch [15], Okun [17], and Harnbor and Weintraub [7]. With
the exception of Okun's work, most such attempts have produced negative results. For evidence
relating the market-clearing yield on inside assets (corporate bonds) to the amount supplied, see
Friedman [4].

The Journal of Finance

970

Tests using survey data to deErc the term premium as above do not show
strong evidence of systematic variation of the term premium with simple measures
of the relative supplies of government securities. For the ratio of outstanding
amounts of 3- and 6-month Treasury bills (RAT), for example, the ordinary leastsquares results are
TP1 = —0.51 + 0.56RAT (R2 = .04, SE = 0.45%, DW= 1.15)
(0.70)
TP2

(0.36)

= —1.17 + 0.91RAT
(1.03)

= .06, SE = 0.67%, DW

(R2

1.46).

(0.53)

Here the coefficient on the ratio of outstandings is significantly different from
zero at the .10 level but not the .05 level in the equation for the two-period-hence
premium, and not even at the .10 level in the equation for the one-period-hence
premium. Similarly, for the mean maturity of the entire outstanding Treasury
debt (MAT), the ordinary least-squares results are
TP1

=

0.26

(0.64)
TP2

= —0.70 +
(0.94)

0.OO8MAT (R2 = .03, SE = 0.47%, DW= 1.03)
(0.017)
0.O35MAT
(0.025)

(R2

= .03, SE = 0.68%, DW=

1.31).

Here the coefficient on the mean maturity variable is significantly different from
zero at the .10 level in neither equation. More complicated equations, relating the
term premium to lagged values of the ratio or mean maturity variable, or to both
at once, yield similarly negative results.1°
In sum, the use of survey expectations instead of constructed expectations
proxies does not yield evidence that the term premium at the very short end of
the maturity spectrum varies systematically with the maturity structure of the
outstandingU.S. Treasury securities.
V. Does the Term Premium Vary with Economic Activity?

The contributions of Kessel and others provide grounds for believing that the
term premium will vary not only according to interest rate levels, as shown above,
but also according to any of several dimensions of economic activity. Plausible
examples of such variables in this context include the unemployment rate, the
growth rate of real gross national product, and the rate of increase of prices (the
GNP deflator), all as indicators of various cyclical aspects of economic activity.
Additional plausible examples include the growth rate of the money stock
(M — 1) and the federal government deficit, as indicators of monetary and fiscal
policy, respectively.
Table 1 shows the results of estimating by ordinary least squares the relationship
°The joint relationship between TP1 and the variable set (RAT, RAT-I, MAT, MAT1) does
yield F (4, 25) 2.89 versus a critical value of 2.76 at the .05 level; but one "significant" result in about
twenty combinations is no sign of a genuine relation.

where X in turn is each of the five economic activity variables considered in Table
1. For all variables except price inflation, the results make clear that the basic
relation is between the term premium and interest rate levels, not economic
nctivity, and that the appearance of a significant relation in Table 1 is due merely
to the correlation between X and R; X adds nothing significant to the explanation
of the term premium after allowing for R," but R does so after allowing for X.
The price inflation variable and the (nominal) interest rate level are sufficiently
correlated that neither adds anythingsignificant after allowing for the other.
In sum, the evidence supports a relationshipbetween the term premium and
simple indicators of economic activity, but only to the extent that the term
premium varies with interest rate levels, and interest rate levels in turn vary with
economic activity. The evidence does not support a relationship between the
term premium and simple indicatorsof economic policy.

VI. Concluding Remarks
The statistical results assembled in this paper provide evidence disconfirming the
"pure expectations theory" of the term structure of interest rates. The market
does not price debts of different maturity so that implied forward rates are
identical 10 expected future interest rates, but instead incorporates a positive
term premium in rates on longer-term debts. Moreover, the premium for a given
maturity varies positively with the level of prevailing interest rates. By contrast,
the simple experiments reported here show no evidence ofindependent systematic
variation of the term premium either with relative supplies of outside assets or
with familiar indicators of economic activity and monetary and fisc.l policy.
"The effect of Y in the equation for TP2 is an exception, but one in ten at the .10 level again
constitutes no genuine evidence.

These results are highly limited, of course, in that they focus on'y on the very
short end of the debt maturity spectrum—only out to nine months. Nevertheless,
they provide new information bearing on familiar questions, and they suggest the
usefulness of exploiting survey data on expectations whenever such data are
available.
