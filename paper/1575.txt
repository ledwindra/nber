Real Interest Rates, Credit Markets,
and Economic Stabilization

ABSTRACT

The role of a real interest rate and a credit aggregate as inter-

mediate monetary policy targets are investigated under the assumption of

rational expectations. The analysis expands a standard aggregate model to
include a credit market and a market determined interest rate on bank

deposits. This allows the implications for output stabilization of real
interest rate policy to be examined for a wider variety of shocks than
normally considered in the literature, as well as allowing a credit aggregate
policy to be studied.

1.

Introduction

During the 1970s, monetary authorities in a number of
countries reoriented the conduct of policy toward setting explicit

targets for monetary growth. Two principal criteria of this approach
('rieciman

[1975

})

are that the measure of the money supply be closely

related to the policy objective variable —

usually

nominal income

growth — and that the money supply contain reliable information about
the future path of this variable. However, instability in estimated
money demand equations in the mid—1970s and, more recently, the extent
and speed at which innovation has been occurring in financial markets

in response to record high interest rates, deregulation, the
computerization of the financial industry and other factors 1 have
raised concern about the appropriateness of using iaonetary growth

targets for short—run policy purposes. Indeed, two consequences of
financial innovation can be identified which would suggest (or in some
circumstances clearly have indicated) that the aforementioned criteria
are not being met.

The first involves the spread of cash management

techniques whereby transactions oalances are kept at a minimum. This
development results in a shift in the relationship between the money
supply and the ultimate policy objective, thereby rendering monetary
growth targets less useful unless the changing relationship can be

monitored closely. The second involves combining transactions and
savings balances, particularly those of the household sector, into an

—2—

all—in—one account which earns a near—market rate of interest.2 This
development introduces an interest—rate—setting decision, or an
own—rate, into the relationship between the money supply and the
policy variable.

Because of these changing circumstances, increasing
attention is being focused on the possible role of real interest rates
as intermediate targets for monetary policy.

In considering real

interest rates for purposes of conducting policy, four important

issues need to be addressed: Ci) what real interest rate measure
should be used (Feldstein and Summers [1978 ]),

(ii)

what ability does

the monetary authority have to control the real rate (Shiller [1980 ]),

(iii)

what is an appropriate target level, if any, for the real rate,

and (iv) what are the consequences of focusing on real interest rates
as opposed solely to a monetary aggregate for purposes of setting

policy. In this paper, the last three issues are addressed with
particular attention being placed on the fourth issue.

As an alternative to both monetary aggregates andreal
interest rates, Friedman [1983 ] has suggested that the close

correlation between nominal income and a credit aggregate be exploited

in the design of monetary policy. By incorporating a rudimentary
credit market, the model developed here can also examine the role of a
credit aggregate as an intermediate target for monetary policy.

In the next section, a basic aggregate, rational
expectations model is extended to incorporate a market for loans, a

—3—

market determined interest rate on deposits, and a monetary policy
rule which permits non—borrowed reserves to deviate from a target path
in response to both real interest rate movements and movements in the

aggregate quantity of loans. The model is used, in section 3, to
examine the implications of such a policy rule for aggregate output

and price stability. Conclusions are summarized in section 4.

2. The Model
This section extends a standard aggregate rational
expectations model (McCalluni [1980 )

to

incorporate a market for loans

and bank reserves. It differs from the recent models of Parkin
[1978], Turnovsky [1980] and Benavie and Froyen [1983 ] by considering

policy rules which incorporate responses to a real interest rate and a
credit aggregate.
The real side of the economy consists of two equations.

The first is a very simple IS relationship determining aggregate

demand. This is assumed to take the form

(1)

=

8_r+€

where y is the logarithm of aggregate output and r is the real rate
of interest on bank loans, the only nonmonetary asset in the model; e
is a white noise disturbance term.

—4—

The second equation, which completes the specification
of the goods market is an aggregate supply function given by

variable x formed at time t—1. This general notation is used
througnout the analysis and expectations are assumed to be rational.

The disturbance term in (2), u. is assumed to be a white noise
process.

The demand for loans is assumed to be inversely related
to the real interest rate on loans and positively related to income.

This latter effect reflects an assumption that both firms and
households increase their demand for loans as aggregate real spending

rises. The loan demand

is then given by

Banks are assumed to issue loans and deposits and to
hold reserves against their deposits.

If banks face a downward

sloping demand for loans as a function of the interest rate on loans,

an upward sloping demand for deposits as a function or dt' and an
upward sloping supply of federal funds as a function of the interest

rate on federal funds, i, bank supply of loans will take the form

The demand for reserves by banks will be assumed equal

to requirea reserves; excess reserves are set equal to zero. If the
lo of the reserve requirement ratio is p and the log of total
reserves is trt,

—6—

tr = p+ d.

The supply of reserves has two components: non—borrowed
reserves nbc, the monetary authorities' policy instrument, and

borroweu reserves. To represent bank borrowing behaviour, assume the
ratio of total reserves (borrowed plus non—borrowed) to non—borrowed
reserves is given by

trt —

Equations (5)—(8) provide a very simple representation of the banking

sector. For a discussion of the aerivation of such relationships from
a model of profit maximizing banks, see Benavie and Froyen [1982 J.

To link the real and nominal interest rates on loans,
the Fisher equation is assumed to take the form

One key feature ot this model is that participants in financial
markets are assumed to have current—period aggregate information when

forming expectations about the one—perioc ahead rate of inflation. In
the supply function, however,

appears. This can be rationalized

in terms of one—period wage contracts in the labour market and in

terns of quick processing an dissemination ot intoruation in
financial markets. This feature of the model is incorporated by using
—

+ Pt instead of (the more common)

as the

—7—

real interest rate. As ficCallum [1980 ] has demonstrated, this

specification invalidates the policy ineffectiveness proposition
characteristic of one class of rational expectations models developed
by Sargent and Wallace [1975 ] and others by making the unconditional
variance of the expectationaJ. error for Pt potentially dependent on
policy paranieters.

To complete the model, a specification of the monetary

authorities' behaviour nest be adopted. One formulation of policy is
that used by Poole [1970 } in which a fixed money stock rule is

compared with a fixed nominal interest rate rule. However, Sargent
and Wallace [1975 J have shown that under such an interest rate rule

tne price level is indeterminate. 6 Accordingly, policy will be

characterized by a feedback rule for nbt that allows nb to deviate
from a (constant) target in response to past fluctuations in the real
interest rate from its expected level.

In considering a potential

role for real interest rates as an intermediate target, however, it is
important to bear in mind t1at the monetary authorities cannot

arbitrarily fix rt given the model's assumption that aggregate supply
equals aggregate uecaand. In addition, to capture the role of a credit
aggregate in the design of monetary policy, the monetary authorities

are assumed to adjust nb in response to unanticipated movements in
the stock ot loans. The feedback rule is assumed to take the form

However, it is also the case that the

class of policies which are likely to actually be followed by

central banks, and wtiich have recently been proposed, are more closely

captured by a rule such as equation (10) than they are by an optimal
feedback rule.

Thus, making the level of

and the e.'s, have no effect on either output or

prices under a fixed real rate policy. The price level is determinate
under such a policy because, from (10), expected future values of

non—borrowed reserves are given by m and are thus finite (see
HcCallum [1981 1)•

Having demonstrated that r is affected by policy in the
model, the consequences of targeting on the real interest rate by the
monetary authorities can now be analyzed in the context of the model

solution when m1 is finite. The general solution for y is given in
(13). Comparing (13) with (12) shows immediately that only in the

clear conflict exists between stabilizing r and stabilizing y. Shifts

affecting interest sensitive components of aggregate demand, the
movement in r tends to work as an automatic stabilization mechanism.
If policy attempts to prevent movements in r, this automatic

result.

Under a pure non—borrowed reserve rule, m1=m2=O and the
coefficient on

in (13) is less than one so that y responds less to

than under a rule which fixes rt. This result corresponds to that
of Poole's analysis in which a money supply rule is preferred if

disturbances occur to aggregate demand. The combination policy which

insulates y from

shocks requires the monetary authorities to

reduce the current level of non—borrowed reserves if last period's

real interest rate was unexpectedly high (m1( 0).

produce output and price fluctuations under a credit aggregate policy.

4. Summary ano Conclusions
This paper utilizes an expanded aggregate rational
expectations model which includes a crenit market to investigate
possible roles tor real interest rates ana a credit aggregate as

— lb —

intermediate

targets for purposes of short—run stabilization policy.

For this purpose policy is characterized by a feedback rule that
permits non—borrowed reserves to cieviate from a constant target in

response to past fluctuations in either the real interest rate or the
stock of loans outstanaing from expected 1CVCIS.

The analysis shows that stabilizing real interest rates
and stabilizing output and the price level (or nominal income) in

response to demand shocks is not possible. A non—borrowed reserve
rule, as with the money supply rule in the original Poole analysis, is

preferred in this circumstance. With pure supply or financial sector
shocks, output can be stabilized by stabilizing unexpected fliOVeUieflCS

in real interest rates, at the cost, for supply shocks, of increased

price variance. Moreover, the monetary authorities can only stabilize
the real interest rate at the value determined by equating aggregate
supply with aggregate demand.

Stabilizing output and the price level in response to
deiuand shocks is also not possible by following a credit aggregate

rule. However, oecause interest rates ntst adjust to prevent any
unanticipateci fluctuations in bank loans with such a rule, the

contributions of demand shocks to the variance in output is less than

in the case of a real interest rate rule. In contrast, stabilizing
credit in response to an aggregate supply shock would not prevent

output fluctuations as would a real rate rule, because the resulting
moveuents in interest rates have a proportionate impact on aggregate

— 17 —

aemand.

With financial sector disturbances, other than those to loan

demand, the analysis shows the equivalence of a real interest rule and
a credit aggregate rule.

FOOTNOTE S

1 Financial innovation in Canada has been spurred primarily by market
forces, whereas in the United States, the Depository Institutions
Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 has given additional
impetus to developments in financial markets.
2 The most recent example in the United States is the Super—NOW
account which was introduced in early 1983. In Canada, most
chartered banks now offer daIly Interest chequlng accounts which
combine features of daily interest savings and personal chequing
accounts.
See, for example, Benavie and Froyen [1982] for an analysis of the
relationship between policy variables and the money supply with a
flexible deposit rate.
Moreover, in the United States, recently proposed bills in both
Houses of Congress seek to amend the Federal Reserve Act by
requiring the Federal Open Market Committee to establish targets
for long—term nominal or short—term real rates of interest. For
discussions of real rate targeting, see Hester [1982] and Walsh
[1983].

See Benavie [1983] for an analysis of monetary policy when the real
rate of interest enters the aggregate supply curve.

6 McCallum [19811 has shown, however, that the nominal interest rate
can be used as a policy instrument to achieve a money target
without leading to problems of price level indeterminacy.
Turnovsky [1980] explicitly takes the view that an indeterminate
expected price level is not a problem if the conditional variance
is finite.
This differs from Woglom [1979] and Benavie [1983] who allow the
monetary authorities to respond contemporaneously to the nominal
rate of interest.
