Monetary Policy Regimes, Expected Inflation, and the
Response of Interest Rates to Money Announcements

AB STRACT

This paper examines the response of the term structure of interest

rates to weekly money announcements. Estimated responses for both the
pre— and post—October 1979 periods are first presented. Then, two competing hypotheses involving the policy anticipations and expected inflation effects are formally specified and compared to the estimated responses.
Both hypotheses are found to be consistent with the responses, but they
have sharply different implications about the Federal Reserve's short—

run monetary policy. The expected inflation hypothesis implies that
weekly money surprises should have persistent effects on the level of the
money stock, reflecting shifts in the Federal Reserve's long—run target.
In contrast, the policy anticipations hypothesis implies that the effect
of money surprises should diminish over time, reflecting the Federal

Reserve's desire to offset deviations from target. Additional empirical
results reported in the paper support this latter description of the
money stock process.

MONETARY POLICY REGIMES, EXPECTED INFLATION,
AND THE RESPONSE OF INTEREST RATES
TO MONEY ANNOUNCEMENTS
V. Vance Roley and Carl E. Walsh*
Recent studies on the response of interest rates to weekly money

announcements reveal several interesting empirical relationships. First, the
empirical results of Berkman (1978), Grossman (1981), and Urich and Wachtel
(1981) indicate that Treasury bill yields rise (fall) in response to an unanti-

cipated increase (decrease) in the announced money stock.- Second, Roley
(1982, 1983) and Cornell (1983) find that the magnitude of the bill—yield

response increased following the Federal Reserve's announced change in operating

procedures on October 6, 1979. Third, Cornell (1983) estimates significant
positive responses for long—term yields in both the pre— and post—October 1979
periods, with a significantly larger response in the post—October 1979 period.
These empirical results are of interest not only because of the

magnitude of the interest—rate fluctuations associated with unanticipated
announced changes in money, but also because the estimated responses potentially

provide evidence on the short—run monetary policy rule describing Federal

Reserve behavior. In particular, under rational expectations, the market's
response depends importantly on the Federal Reserve's desire to offset deviations

in money from its target. The empirical evidence, however, appears to be consistent with two different hypotheses about the Federal Reserve's desire to control
money as well as the information content of weekly money announcements.

One hypothesis relies on studies by Fama (1975) and Nelson and Schwert
(1977), among others, who estimate that changes in expected inflation account

for most of the fluctuations in nominal interest rates.-1 Under this hypothesis,

— 2—

a positive surprise in a weekly money announcement that is not expected to be
offset totally by the Federal Reserve leads to an increase in expected infla-

tion. Thus, the increased interest—rate response following the change in
operating procedures in October 1979 is interpreted as evidence that the

Federal Reserve is less committed to monetary control. Moreover, the signi—
ficant response of long—term interest rates in both the pre— and post—October

1979 periods is interpreted as reflecting changes only in expected inflation
[e.g., Cornell (1983) and Hardouvelis (1982)].

The other hypothesis is based on a policy anticipations effect. Under
this hypothesis, market participants are assumed not to revise their expectation

about future inflation on the basis of any one—week's money surprise. Instead,
the Federal Reserve is assumed to offset at least partially any deviation in

money from its target. A positive money surprise would then imply a rise in
expected future interest rates in anticipation of policy actions designed to

bring the money stock back to target. This paradigm, therefore, suggests that
real interest rates change in response to unanticipated announced changes in

money. Thus, in contrast to the expected inflation hypothesis, the increased
interest—rate response after October 1979 is consistent with a greater desire
by the Federal Reserve to control money along with other possible effects
related more closely to the change in operating procedures itself [e.g., Roley

(1982, 1983) and Walsh (1983)]. Evidence supporting the policy anticipations
hypothesis is presented by Cornell (1982) and Engel and Frankel (1982) who find,
in the context of the foreign exchange market, that the dollar appreciates in
response to a positive surprise in announced money.' However, both Cornell

—3—

(1983) and Hardouvelis (1982) claim that the response of long—term interest
rates Is too large to be explained by this effect.

The purpose of this paper is to specify separate models consistent with
the policy anticipations and expected inflation effects, respectively, and to
compare their implications for interest rate responses over the entire term

structure. The increased response of interest rates after October 1979 and
the relatively large response of long—term rates are shown to be consistent

with the policy anticipations effect. In particular, these phenomena can be
explained by the Federal Reserve's change in operating procedures, the degree
of short—run monetary control, and the persistence of money demand shocks.

Other models of the policy anticipations effect do not include long—term
interest rates, and they selectively ignore such important institutional
features as the type of operating procedures used by the Federal Reserve, lagged
reserve accounting, and the lag in money announcements [e.g., Urich (1982)

and Nichols, Small, and Webster (1983)]. This institutional detail plays a key
role in the models considered here.

In the first section of this paper, the response of the term structure
of interest rates in the pre— and post—October 1979 periods is estimated.

The policy anticipations and the expected inflation models are presented in

the second and third sections, respectively. In the fourth section, the empirical
results are reconciled with the predictions of both models, and additional

empirical evidence on the relative merits of the two models is discussed. The
main conclusions are summarized in the final section.

I. Estimated Response of Interest Rates
In this section, the response of the term structure of interest rates

in the pre— and post—October 1979 periods is estimated. The empirical results

—4—

exhibit both the increase responsiveness since October 1979 and the relatively

large response of long—term yields. These results are presented following
brief discussions of the specification and data used in the estimation.
Specification

The usual efficient markets approach is adopted to estimate the
response of interest rates to weekly money announcements.

To conform with

the theoretical models presented in subsequent sections, the consequences
of the efficient markets hypothesis may be represented as

While a constant term is always included in the empirical specifications,
it should equal zero under the null hypothesis of market efficiency and in
the absence of systematic measurement error.
Data

All of the data described below are weekly and span the period beginning
on September 29, 1977 and ending on October 15, 1982.

The last observation of

the pre—October 1979 subsample falls on October 5, 1979. Observations were
excluded if either discount rate changes or announcements of other relevant
economic data were made within the time interval corresponding to the measured
change in interest rates.'

-.5—

The money stock data consist of announced weekly levels of the narrowly
defined money stock, in billions of dollars, as reported in the Federal Reserve's

H.6 release. From the beginning of the sample through January 31, 1980, the
data correspond to "old Mi," and weekly announcements were made on Thursday.

From February 8, 1980, through October 15, 1982, announcements were made on

Friday. For this period, the data employed are those for Mi—B, and more
recently, Ml, where the definition of this latter aggregate is equivalent to
that of Ml—B.-"

Data for the expected announced level of the money stock are based on

the survey data compiled by Money Market Services, Inc. The survey data
represent the market's expected announced change in the money stock. To
construct expected levels, market participants are assumed to expect no revi-

sion in the previous week's announced level.-" The survey data begins on
September 29, 1977. Prior to February 8, 1980, the median of the Thursday
survey is used to represent the market's anticipated money announcement on

each Thursday. For the remainder of the sample, the survey was conducted
on Tuesday for the Friday announcement. Because of this misalignment, a
revised expectation reflecting the availability of new information from
Tuesday to Friday is used.Zi
The yield data are taken from the H.15 release, published by the

Federal Reserve. All data are in terms of coupon—equivalent yields, in
percent, and quoted bids are used. The change in interest rates is measured
from 3:30 p.m. on the day of a money announcement to 3:30 p.m. on the following

business day. Thus, any effect of money announcements—which are made at
8/
4:10 p.m.—should be reflected in the measured change in yields.—

—6—

Empirical Results
Estimation results of the efficient markets model (1) over the pre—
9/

and post—October 1979 subsainples are presented in Table 1.—

Within each

subsample, the estimated response of Treasury security yields declines, with

one exception, as maturity increases. In the pre—October 1979 subsample, for
example, the 3—month Treasury bill yield is estimated to increase by about
6 1/2 basis points for a 1 percent announced money surprise, while the 20—year yield

increases by about 1 basis point. Similarly, in the post—October 1979 subsample,
the 3—month yield's response is over 2 1/2 times greater than that of the

20—year yield. Despite the lower estimated response of long—term yields,
Cornell (1983) and Hardouvelis (1982) suggest that the response is nevertheless
too large to be explained by the policy anticipations effect, especially in the

post—October 1979 period. Instead, the expected inflation effect is hypothesized
to account for the response of long—term yields.

The empirical results in Table 1 also Indicate that the estimated response
for all maturities of Treasury securities is over five times larger In the post—

October 1979 period. In the last column, the equality of the response is
formally tested, and In each case the null hypothesis can be rejected at less
than the 1 percent level of significance) As mentioned earlier, these

results are apparently consistent with two competing hypotheses.

First, the

response may have increased because of the change in Federal Reserve operating
procedures and perhaps a somewhat greater commitment to monetary control

[Roley (1982, 1983) and Walsh (1983)]. Second, the larger response may reflect
less desire to control money, implying larger changes in expected inflation for
a given money surprise (Cornell (1983) and Hardouvelis (1982)]. These empirical
results are discussed further in the fourth section in the context of the two
competing hypotheses.

II. Policy Anticipations Model
In this section, a model of the response of interest rates to money
announcements is developed which focuses exclusively on the policy ariticipa—

tions effect. By ignoring the role of expected inflation, it will be
possible to determine whether the policy anticipations explanation is, in

isolation, consistent with the empirical results reported in Table 1. Of
particular interest is the ability of the model to explain the response of
long—term interest rates as well as the increased response of all rates in

the post—October 1979 period. Because institutional features are important
for a complete understanding of the policy anticipations effect, it will
be useful to begin with an overview of the Federal Reserve's policy procedures before turning to the formal model.

The money stock figure released at 4:10 p.m. on Fridays is the Federal
Reserve's current estimate of the money stock during the settlement week

ending nine days previously. This has two important implications. First,
because of lagged reserve accounting, the Friday announcement provides
market participants with an estimate of the deposit levels against which

required reserves for the current settlement week are levied. Second, because
money demand shifts cause week to week movements in the quantity of money, the
announcement provides information on any money demand shift which may have
occurred two weeks previously.--"

In estimating the money stock prior to the Friday announcement, the
Federal Reserve may adjust its target path for the monetary aggregates in

light of any deviation of actual money from target. Under lagged reserve

accounting, monetary policy is implemented by using a policy instrument—

—8—

the

federal

funds rate in the pre—October 1979 period and nonborrowed

reserves in the post—October 1979 period—in an attempt to make money
demand equal to the targeted quantity of money. While the direct effects
of Federal Reserve actions are to influence the federal funds rate, this

is not the interest rate most relevant for the demand for money. The
Federal Reserve must, therefore, estimate what change in the funds rate will
lead to changes in other short—term rates which, in turn, will produce the

desired effect on the demand for money. Any model of the policy anticipations

effect needs, therefore, to specify: 1) the informational content of the
money announcement and how it depends on the operating procedures of the
Federal Reserve; 2)

the determinants of the demand for money; 3) the linkages

between variables influencing money demand and the Federal Reserve's policy

instruments; 4) the operating procedures followed by the Federal Reserve in
attempting to achieve its monetary targets; and 5)

the manner in which the

target path for money is adjusted in light of deviations between the actual
quantity of money and the target path.

Within this conceptual framework, consider the actions of the Federal

Reserve at the beginning of settlement week t. Assume, for simplicity, that
in setting its policy instrument for week t, the Federal Reserve, but not

yet the public, knows m2, the (log) money supply during week t—2. This is
the number which will be announced on Friday of week t. The Federal Reserve
cannot yet observe

but on the basis of m2 (and perhaps other inforina—

tion), an estimate of week t—l s deviation from target, E(m1Ict) —

is

formed, where

denotes the Federal Reserve's information set at the start

of week t, E(m1Jc) is the expectation of ini conditional on

and

—9—

is the target value for mi which had been set at the start of
week t—l based on 2

t—1

.

The estimate of this deviation is used to revise the

target path. The policy rule is assumed to be,

mT.() -

m+.(Qi)

+

(lA)

[E(m_i) —

(l-oi)]

mi(i)J;

i =

0,1,...

(2)

According to (2), a deviation from target during week t—l leads to a revised

target path for money for all future weeks. Equation (2) implies that the

Federal Reserve plans to offset eventually a fraction (l_l) of the week t—1
deviation from target. It does so only gradually, however, at the rate (1—A)

per week. The remaining fraction of the deviation, ,
If

=

is

not offset.1

0, the new path [m+(2)] returns to the old path [m+.(2i)] as j-.

Because this section treats expected inflation as constant in order to emphasize
the policy anticipations effect, equation (2) implicitly assumes that the
Federal Reserve does not revise its targeted long—run growth rate for the
money supply.

The Federal Reserve has two potential policy instruments: the weekly

average federal funds rate, i, or the weekly average path of (log) nonborrowed

reserves, 1n1BR.-1 Dealing first with the pre—October 6, 1979 period, i
will initially be treated as the tool used to implement policy.
Pre—October 1979 Qperat ing Procedures

Prior to October 1979, the Federal Reserve used

in trying to equate

money demand to the targeted quantity of money. It is assumed that money demand
is given by

—10—

where Pt is the log of the price level and rt is the rate on an n—week

security, such as a 13—week Treasury bill. The appearance of r in (3)
captures the notion that the demand for money does not depend on the federal

funds rate, but on a longer term interest rate. Income is treated as a
constant for this analysis and is not explicitly included in (3). Since, in
this section, Pt will be treated as a constant, it will be covenient to define

+ Pt and write

cx =

mt =a—cr

As (3) is a weekly money demand equation, the random disturbance

is likely to exhibit a high degree of serial correlation.—

Equation (5) reveals why current interest rates such as rt will depend on
anticipated future policy since rt is a function of expected future settings
of the policy variable

Using the money demand function (3), the Federal Reserve can calculate
the path of rt which is consistent with its target path for the money stock,

conditional on the information available at the beginning of week t. If

r÷.(c) is this target path, suppose i'+.O7) is the path for the federal funds
rate which satisfies:

Because of idiosyncratic developments during week t, assume the funds rate
actually set by the Federal Reserve is given by
=

where

i()

+

is a mean zero, serially uncorrelated weekly policy deviation from

the targeted value of the funds rate.

With a funds rate operating procedure, the Federal Reserve sets

according to (7) at the beginning of the settlement week. Because i(c2) is
based on t which includes information not available to the public prior to
the Friday announcement, the public cannot distinguish the component parts

in (7). Using the term structure equation (5), the appendix shows that r can
be written as
rt

E(u÷+i —

E(rI)

(8)

Equation (8) shows explicitly how r depends on the public's expectations about
the target path for the money supply.

In order to analyze the effects of the money announcement, it will be
and relate

necessary to define more specifically the public's information set
it to the Federal Reserve's information set

Let

denote the public's

information prior to the money announcement. Let r be the equilibrium value
of rt, just prior to the announcement, obtained by substituting

(8). Similarly, define

{m2,

—12—

is announced. The interest rate after the announcement is r. Since
the only new information analyzed here is the announcement of tn2, it follows

(9)

The money "surprise", the difference between the announcement on Friday and
the public's expectation of in2, is just the week t—2 innovation in the money
demand disturbance.

Making use of the policy rule (2), together with (8), it is possible to
derive the adjustment in r which occurs in response to the announcement (details
can be found in the appendix):

on

the week t—2 money demand innovation, its effect on r can be seen from (10)

to consist of three components. The last term, c (l--n)1p/n < 0 is a Keynesian
liquidity effect. To the extent that a positive deviation above target, for
example, is partially accommodated

<

1),

the money supply will be

permanently higher. Since the interest elasticity of the demand for money
is negative, interest rates must fall.

The middle term in (10) is positive and represents the effect on

the public's revised expectations about future money demand. If

r of

c2 > 0,

—13—

individuals revise upwards their estimates of future u's. Higher estimates
of future money demand lead to expectations of higher future interest rates
for a given target path.

The first term in (10), is negative since (l_X)hl < 1.

The upward

pressure on interest rates produced by a positive surprise is moderated to
the extent that the Federal Reserve is expected to return in to the target path
only

15/
gradually.—

The effect of the money announcement in this policy anticipations model
on interest rates of longer maturity than rt can also easily be derived using

the expectations model of the term structure. Let Rt be the rate on a security

Post—October 1979 Operatin& Procedures
Equations (10) and (12) give the response to the money announcement
of both short— and long—term interest rates under a federal funds rate operating

—14—

procedure. On October 6, 1979, however, the Federal Reserve shifted to a
nonborrowed reserves operating procedure. Such a procedure involves setting
a path for rionborrowed reserves which is consistent with achieving the targeted

path for money. To analyze the interest rate response to a money announcement
during the post—October 1979 period it is necessary to note that the current
week's funds rate,

is no longer fixed. A positive money surprise indicates

to market participants that the level of required reserves for the current

settlement week will be higher than expected. This should lead to a higher
funds rate in the remainder of the current week, which through the term

structure equation (5), leads to a higher r. To explicitly model this
additional effect, it is necessary to incorporate into the model a specification
of the market for reserves.

Under lagged reserve accounting, the log of required reserves is given
by
=

k

+ m2

(13)

where k is the log of the required reserve ratio. For simplicity, it is
assumed that all deposits are subject to the same reserve ratio and that the

deposit to money ratio is constant. Assuming excess reserves are zero,
equation (13) gives the demand for reserves.

The supply of reserves consists of nonborrowed reserves—taken to be
the policy variable in the post—October 1979 period—and borrowed reserves.
A rise in the funds rate relative to the discount rate leads to a rise in
bank borrowings and a fall in nonborrowed reserves as a fraction of total

reserves. This relationship is specified as

1979 period, assume that at the beginning of week t, the public knows lnBR
but not its decomposition into lnNBR and

A positive surprise (cr2 > 0) causes an upward revision in expected reserve
demand over the remainder of the settlement week, leading to a rise in the
funds rate.

To determine the impact under a reserves operating procedure of the

announcement, equation (5) can be utilized, along with (16) to derive the
response of the short—term interest rate:

One result is immediate from a comparison of (10), the pre—October 1979
effect, and (17), the post—October 1979 effect. For given values of a, p, A,

and 5, the change in operating procedures introduces a new term, l/n > 0,
into the response coefficient. A given money surprise has a larger effect on
short—term interest rates under a nonborrowed reserves operating procedure

than under a funds rate operating procedure. This is consistent with the
increased response after October 1979 documented in Table 1. From (12) and
(17), however, it may be shown that the response of longer term (in—quarter)

yields increases by only 1/m .

1/en.

Thus, some other factors in the model must

contribute to the increased response of long—term yields.

One possibility is that the change in operating procedures was viewed
by the public as accompanied by a shift in the policy adjustment rule followed
by the Federal Reserve. If the use of noriborrowed reserves rather than the
funds rate was interpreted as signaling a greater determination on the part
of the Federal Reserve to keep money on target, either A or

have changed. A fall in

(or both) may

would indicate that less of any deviation from

target would be accommodated, while a rise in A would indicate a faster elimina-

tion of any deviations. Either such change tends to increase the response to
the money surprise in (17) and (12).

Another result of the change in operating procedures was a large increase

in the volatility generally of interest rates. In Walsh (1982, 1983), it is

—17—

shown that a rise in the volatility of interest rates may lead to a fall in
the interest elasticity of the demand for money which is proportional to the
as a consequence of the shift to a

rise in volatility. Such a decline in

nonborrowed reserves operating procedure would also tend to increase the

response of both short— and long—term yields to a given money surprise.
effects of changes in these various parameters are examined further using
numerical examples in the fourth section.

III. pected Inflation Model
The model in the previous section, in order to focus on the policy

anticipations effect, assumed that the expected rate of inflation remained

constant in the face of the money announcement. This implies that the interest
rate adjustments were adjustments in real interest rates. An alternative view
of interest rate determination argues that real interest rates are independent
of monetary influences so that any response of interest rates to a money

announcement must be due to changes in the expected inflation premium incorporated

in market rates. The present section develops a model of interest rate responses
which attributes all changes in rates to changes in expected inflation.

uncorrelated.
In the model of section II, any deviation of the money stock from its
target value leads to an adjustment in target levels but no change in the targeted

long—run growth rate. This assumption needs to be modified to allow for the
possibility that a value of m_2 above target leads the Federal Reserve to revise

—18—

upwards its targeted growth rate. If this occurred, the public, in the face of
a positive money surprise, might infer faster money growth and higher inflation

in the future. This possibility can be captured by rewriting the policy
reaction rule in the form

where use has been made of the fact that Pc_2 =

To

understand the role of 2' suppose that the targeted growth rate is k and that
=

m2

+ (j+2)k. The actual growth rate from t—2 to t—l is estimated,

at time t, to be k+ pc2. If this growth rate were to be maintained, the new
=

target for m+. would be
and

E(m 1Ic2) + (j+1)k + (j+l)pc2 (ignoring A

for simplicity). If the deviation has no effect on the targeted growth

rate, m+. = E(mt tt) + (j+1)k, which is the case considered in the previous
section. Equation (2) allows a fraction t52 of the growth—rate deviation to
have a permanent effect on the Federal Reserve's growth—rate target.

To determine the expected rate of inflation as a function of the underlying parameters of the model, it is first necessary to find the equilibrium

solution for the log of the price level. From the money demand equation (3)
and the Fisher equation (18):

permanent change in the annual growth rate of money leads to a one—f or—

Because interest rates in this model adjust only in response to

changes

in the expected rate of Inflation, It Is possible to solve for the adjustment
responses in (22) and (23) without any reference to the Federal Reserve's

operating procedure. The expected Inflation model predicts that the interest

—20--

rate response to a money announcement is independent of the particular proce-

dure used by the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy. To explain
the large increases in the response coefficients reported in Table 1 within
the context of the inflation expectations model, it is necessary to assume
that there were shifts in the basic model parameters at the time of the change

in operating procedures. For example, a rise in 62 the fraction of the week
t—2 to t—l growth rate deviation which the Federal Reserve accommodates, would

increase the response coefficients. Using numerical examples, the model is
also compared to the estimated responses in the next section.

IV. Evaluation of the Models
In this section, the stylized models of the policy anticipations and
the expected inflation effects are examined in terms of their consistency

with the empirical results reported in Table 1. While the models are specified
under a variety of simplifying assumptions, they nevertheless embody the impor-

tant features of the underlying hypotheses. Following the evaluation of the
models, additional empirical evidence is presented on the persistence of
announced money surprises.
In examining the consistency of the models with the estimated responses
in Table 1, iterative grid searches are performed over the models' parameters

in both the pre— and post—October 1979 periods. In addition, the searches
are implemented simultaneously for the 3—month (n=13), 1—year (m=4), 5—year

(m=20), 10—year (m=40), and the 20—year (m=80) yields. For the policy
anticipations model, the response of the 3—month yield is represented by (10) and

(17) for the pre— and post—October 1979 periods, respectively. For longer
term yields (m=4, 20, 40, 80), the response under both policy regimes is

—21—

given by (12). For the expected inflation model, the response of the
3—month yield is represented by (22), and the response of longer term yields

,

is given by (23). In each case, all parameters of the models——A,

p,

and cS2 (when relevant)——are subjected to the grid search. The criterion
used in the search is to minimize the sum of the absolute percentage
differences from the point estimates in Table 1 across the five yields._Z'

Is the Policy Anticp!4ons Model Consistent with the Estimated Responses?
The response of the term structure of interest rates under the policy
anticipations hypothesis is computed for selected parameter values in Table 2.
The reported values for the responses consist of both those conforming to the
estimated responses in Table 1——given the criterion described above——as well

as examples exhibiting the effects of changes in parameter values. As is
apparent in the table, sets of parameters are calculated separately for the
pre— and post—October 1979 periods.

For the pre—October 1979 period, the policy anticipations model is
capable of yielding responses fairly close to those in Table 1 when the
parameters take values of p =

.986,

=

.143,

A

.687, and

=

.000.

The response of the 3—month yield, for example, is calculated as 6.48, which

is identical to its estimated value in Table 1. Moreover, the responses of
longer term interest rates are all positive and fairly close to the
corresponding estimated values.

The reported parameter values implied by the responses for the pre—
October 1979 period suggest that weekly money demand disturbances are highly
serially correlated (p =
completely (6, =

0).

.986),

and that they are eventually offset

The speed at which a money demand shock is offset,

—22—

however, is implausibly high. In particular, the value in Table 2 (A =
implies that approximately 68 percent (A

p

.687)

cr2) of a surprise in

announced money is offset during the week of the announcement. The responses
are nevertheless quite insensitive to changes in the rate at which surprises

are offset, as indicated by the third and fourth rows in Table 2. In contrast,
the fraction of the surprise accommodated has a larger impact on the responses,
as indicated in the second row, where

is increased to .100.

In the lower panel of Table 2, sets of parameter values for the post—

October 1979 period are reported. The first row again corresponds to the
parameters obtained from the grid search. The next three rows report values
for selected changes in the policy parameters, as before. The results for
the post—October 1979 period suggest that money surprises are somewhat more

highly serially correlated (p =

.996),

and that the interest—rate responsiveness

of money demand is over five times smaller than that in the pre—October 1979

period.--' Because of the persistence of money demand shocks and the much
lower interest—rate responsiveness of money demand, short—term rates must

remain above their original levels for an extended period of time if the

original long—run target path for money is maintained (

0).

The combination

of these factors is sufficient to explain the relatively large response of long—

term interest rates. By comparing the first and fifth rows in each panel, note
that changes in policy parameters across periods have negligible effects on
the responses.

Is the Expected Inflation Model Consistent with the Estimated Responses?

Analogous to Table 2, the response of the term structure of interest
rates under the expected inflation hypothesis is solved for selected parameter

values in Table 3. As before, parameter values may be obtained which are consistent with the estimated responses in Table 1. In the pre—October 1979 period,
the value for the serial correlation of money demand shocks is again quite high,

but the interest—rate responsiveness of money demand Is lower than that computed

under the policy anticipations hypothesis. The policy parameters also differ
substantially. In particular, the rate at which money surprises are offset
(X) is .438, although the reported responses are fairly insensitive to this

parameter, as Indicated in the fourth and fifth rows in the table. In addition,
the results suggest that a portion of the shock is accommodated by changing the
level of money's target path (oi =

.006),

and that the Federal Reserve permanently

raises its target growth rate in response to a positive shock (62 = .000192).
For a positive 1 percent shock, for example, the target annualized growth rate is
increased by almost .01 percentage points (52

62). As indicated in the table,

the 20—year yield's response of about 1 basis point predominately reflects this

revision in the target growth rate. This sensitivity is also apparent in the
sixth and seventh rows in the table, where the responses are calculated with

different values of 62. The response of short—term yields also depends
importantly on the initial accommodation in the current level of money (6i),
as may be seen in the second and third rows.

For the post—October 1979 period, the two main changes in the parameters
are that 62 increases to .00256 and the interest—rate responsiveness of money

demand is about one—half its previous value. As suggested by Cornell (1983)
and Hardouvelis (1982), the increase in 62 indicates greater accommodation of
money surprises by the Federal Reserve through revisions in its target growth

rate. In this case, the calculated value of 62 indicates that a 1 percent

—24—

money surprise leads to a revision in the target annualized money growth of

.13 percentage points. Again, the 20—year yield's response of 14.6 basis
points predominately reflects this accommodation. The eighth row in each panel
also indicates the key role of this parameter.

Persistence of Money Surprises
The previous two subsections indicate that different sets of parameter
values may be found that make both the policy anticipations and expected infla-

tion hypotheses consistent with the estimated responses in Table 1. Despite
this inability to distinguish between the hypotheses on the basis of their
consistency with the estimated responses, the implications of the models do

differ dramatically. In particular, under the policy anticipations hypothesis,
the parameter values indicate that money surprises are totally offset after

some period of time. In contrast, under the expected inflation hypothesis,
target growth rates are permanently changed in the direction of the surprise.

These different implications suggest one way in which the hypotheses

may be distinguished. In particular, under the policy anticipations hypothesis,
past surprises in the announced level of money would be expected to have

diminishing effects on the level of the money stock over time. Under the
expected inflation hypothesis, this should not be the case. Indeed, for
money surprises to affect expected inflation over the maturity of a long—
term security, surprises would be expected to persist over lengthy intervals.

The monetary policy rule specified previously (2) may be used to
illustrate the possible relationship between past money surprises and the

level of the money stock. In particular, recursive substitution

yields

where

Under the pure policy anticipations model,

62 = 0 so that as j becomes large, the coefficients on the lagged money

surprises decline, approaching 61p asymptotically. In contrast, the inflation expectations model requires 62 >

0.

In this case, equation (24) shows

that as j becomes larger, the coefficients on the lagged money surprises

must eventually start increasing with j. For the parameters reported in
Table 3 for the post—October 1979 period, for example (A =
62 =

.00256),

the coefficients are increasing for j

=

.438,

.021,

10.

Equation (24), therefore, suggests a simple means of discriminating
between the policy anticipations hypothesis and the inflation expectations

hypothesis. To examine the persistence of money surprises, the following
empirical analogue of equation (24) is estimated:

both the pre— and post—October 1979 periods are reported in Table 4. In
each case, the equation is estimated without any constraints on the lag
20 /

structure.—

The estimation results suggest that money surprises are offset within

one year. In both periods, additional lag terms were included in the equations
until the estimated coefficients appeared to remain around, or even below,

zero.—' In the pre—October 1979 period, the unconstrained estimates become
negative after 33 weeks. Similarly, estimated lag coefficients for the post—
October 1979 period become negative after 48 weeks. This empirical evidence,
at least, casts strong doubt on the validity of the expected inflation hypothesis.

V. Summary of Conclusions
By constructing a model of interest rate responses to money announcements,
it has been possible to examine explicitly the effect of the Federal Reserve's
operating procedures and policy rule on the responses across the entire term

structure of interest rates. Two main conclusions follow from this paper.
First, despite claims to the contrary, the policy anticipations hypothesis

is capable of explaining the response of the entire term structure of interest

rates to surprises in weekly money announcements. This hypothesis was shown
to be consistent with the response in both the pre— and post—October 1979

periods. Two key elements of this explanation involve the persistence of
money demand shocks along with the Federal Reserve's desire to eventually

offset money surprises. Nevertheless, the expected inflation hypothesis was
also shown to be consistent with the term structure's response. Under this
hypothesis, it follows that the Federal Reserve increases both the level and
growth rate of their monetary target in response to positive money surprises.
Second, in examining the effects of past money surprises on the level of

the money stock, the empirical evidence suggested that their effects diminish

to zero within one year. This result is inconsistent with the expected inflation hypothesis, which posits an increasing effect of money surprises on the

level of the money stock. Further empirical work would, nevertheless, be
useful in distinguishing between the competing hypotheses.

1. InitIal research on this topic also includes unpublished studies
by
Sivesarid (1978) and Conrad (1978).
2. Both of these studies
are, of course, based on pre—October 1979 data.
Using post—October 1979 data, Makin (1982) finds that movements in nominal
interest rates have been influenced
more by changes in expected real rates
than by expected inflation.
3. However, Cornell (1982) does not attribute these results to the
anticipations effect. Also, Urich and Wachtel (1982) and Roley and policy
Troll
(1983) exanine the impact of
unanticipated announced changes in the consumer (CPI) and producer (FF1) price indices on Treasury bill yields. Both
studies find statistically Insignificant responses in the pre—October 1979
period, and Urich and Wachtel (1982) estimate
a response to FF1 surprises
which is significant at the 5 percent level in the October i979—June 1981
period. By extending the sample to October 1982, however, Roley and Troll
(1983) fincf That the estimated
response is again insignificant at the 10
percent level.

4. The excluded observations
correspond to announcements of the CPI, the
FF1, the unemployment rate, and industrial production. In the pre—October
1979 sample, 43 observations were excluded, while 22 were excluded in the
post—October 1979 sample.
5. Announced changes in Mi—B are analyzed here because of the emphasis
placed on Mi—B by Federal Reserve polIcyrnakers
and market participants. It
should also be noted that the Mi—B data for 1981 are not the shift—adjusted
MI—B figures which reflect the introduction of nationwide NOW accounts.
While the Federal Reserve's target range was in terms of shift—adjusted Mi—B,
weekly announced changes were not shift adjusted.
6. As reported by Roley (1983) in the context of the response of Treasury
bill yields, specifying the surprise in terms of levels rather than changes
has virtually no effect on the empirical results. For this paper, specifications were estimated with changes in the levels of interest rates,
changes in the log of interest rates, and with money surprises in terms of
announced changes, announced levels, and the log of announced levels.
Again these alternative specifications
yielded virtually the same results.
We are Indebted to Raul A. Nicho, vice
president with Money Market Services,
for making the survey data available for this project.

7. In forming the revised expectation, the change in the 3—month bill yield
from Tuesday at 3:30 p.m. to Friday at 3:30 p.m. is taken as a proxy for the
receipt of all new information from the time of the survey to just before
the money announcement. Regressing the announced change in money on the
survey measure and this change in the bill yield indicates that this proxy
is statistically significant at the 5 percent level [see Roley (1983)]. The
rationality of the survey data is examined by Grossman (1981) for the pre—
October 1979 period and by Roley (1983) for the post—October 1979 period.
These studies indicate that except for an additive bias in the pre—October
1979 period, usual hypotheses concerning the rationality of the expected
money data used here cannot be rejected at low significance levels. For
further analysis of these data, see Urich and Wachtel (1983).

eral funds rate data
In contrast to the other yield data used here,
provided by the Federal Reserve are in terms of daily averages. These data,
however, predominately reflect federal funds trading before 3:30 p.m.
8.

9. Following Urich and Wachtel (1981) and Roley (1983), more complicated
specifications which disaggregated money surprises according to the relationship of money growth to its long—run policy ranges were also estimated.
However, because of the larger standard errors of the equations estimated
here due to the longer time interval over which the changes in rates were
measured, the effects of policy ranges were not statistically significant
for any of the yields in the post—October 1979 period. In the pre—October
1979 period, however, the effects of policy ranges were statistically
significant in two instances, but only because of statistically significant
coefficients with perverse signs. Also, the presence of statistically
significant constant terms in some of the estimated equations in Table 1
may reflect measurement error in either the expected money data or the
change in interest rates. Alternatively, they may reflect day—of—the—week
effects [Gibbons and Hess (1981)).
10. To avoid potential problems associated with heteroscedasticitY, the
equations in each of the periods are weighted by the reciprocals of their
estimated standard errors in the tests.
11. The role of the announcement in providing information on past money
demand shifts is emphasized by Urich (1982) and Nichols, Small, and lebster
(1983).

12. Equation (2) is similar to the policy rule used by Tinsley, von zur
= 0.
l'Iuehlen, and Fries (1982), although they assume
13. McCallum and Hoehn (1983) analyze the optimal instrument choice in the
context of lagged reserve accounting. For empirical evidence, see Sivesand
and Hurley (1980).
14. In a similar specification of a biweekly money demand equation, Urich
(1982) assumes u is serially uncorrelated.

15. Equation (10) can be compared with the results of other authors. Urich
(1982) assumes ct2 provides no information on
and that 6-j
0. His
expression for the announcement effect corresponds, therefore, only to the
first term in (10). Nichols, Small, and Webster (1983) rely on an expected
interest rate change in the money demand equation to motivate future expectations affecting current interest rates. They also assume m is the policy
instrument of the Federal Reserve and that ni2 — E(m
reveals information on the net shock to both money supply and money emand during week
t—2. However, under lagged reserve accounting, the major shocks generating
week—to—week fluctuations in the money stock arise from the demand for money
as modeled here.
16. In the empirical work, interest rates are measured in basis points at
annual rates. This makes it necessary to multiply an n—week rate of change
such as t+n —
Pt by 5200.
17. For computational convenience, certain limitations were placed on the
number of digits taken by the parameters. In particular, A, , and p were
restricted to three decimal points, and three nonzero digits were found for
and 62. All parameters were restricted to take values between zero and
one.

18. The increased interest—rate volatility in the post—October 1979 period
coinciding with the change in operating procedures is capable of explaining
this fall in interest elasticity in the model presented by Walsh (1982,
1983). In addition, this elasticity may have declined due to increased
financial innovation and deregulation, which may not be totally independent
of the rise in volatility. See, for example, Lindsey (1977) and Niehans (1982).

19. Note that a proxy for
is not needed in (24') since the money
surprises t—j—2 (j=0,...,k—1) are, under rational expectations, uncorrelated
with this variable. The proxy was instead included to reduce heteroscedasticity
and serial correlation. In this model, as is common in many rational expectations models, standard serial correlation correction procedures would result
in inconsistent coefficient estimates. In contrast, OLS estimation yields
consistent coefficient estimates in this case, but potentially inconsistent
estimated standard errors.
20. Polynomial lags were also estimated, and they yielded virtually the same
qualitative results.
21. Extending both lags beyond the lengths reported in Table 4 suggested that
the estimated coefficients do not once again increase. Furthermore, lagged
money surprises were entered separately on the right—hand side of (24 )
c1 = 0 (ij), c 0) and the estimation results were comparable to those
reported in the table.
