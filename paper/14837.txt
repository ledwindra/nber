ABSTRACT
This paper: outlines an algorithm for concording U.S. ten-digit Harmonized System export and import
codes over time; describes the concordances we construct for 1989 to 2004; and provides Stata code
that can be used to construct similar concordances for arbitrary beginning and ending years from 1989
to 2007.

Concording U.S. HS Codes Over Time

Introduction

This paper serves three purposes. First, it outlines an algorithm for concording ten-digit U.S.
Harmonized System (HS) product codes over time. Second, it describes how this algorithm can be
used to construct an export- or import-code concordance for any arbitrary beginning and ending
years from 1989 to 2007. Finally, it summarizes the 1989 to 2004 HS concordances used in Bernard,
Jensen, Redding and Schott’s (2009) analysis of the margins of U.S. trade and provides statistics
illustrating the prevalence of changes in HS codes during that time interval. We note that though
the o¢ cial names of U.S. export and import product codes are “Schedule B” and “Harmonized
Tari¤ Schedule” codes, respectively, we refer to both generically as HS codes in this paper.
Section 2 provides a brief description of HS codes. Section 3 describes the data used to construct our concordance. Section 4 outlines our algorithm. Section 5 summarizes the 1989 to 2004
concordance. An appendix contains the Stata computer code and describes the input …les used to
generate concordances.

Brief Description of HS Codes

U.S. HS codes are based on the Harmonized System established by the World Customs Organization (WCO). The WCO assigns 6-digit codes for general categories, and countries adopting the
system then de…ne their own codes to capture commodities at more detailed levels. In the United
States, the most detailed level of disaggregation is ten digits. In this paper, we refer to ten-digit
codes as “product”or “goods”categories. U.S. export codes are administered by the United States
Census Bureau (Census). U.S. import codes are administered by the U.S. International Trade
Commission (USITC).
Changes to U.S. export or import product codes can occur via three routes: changes by the
WCO to the o¢ cial list of international six-digit pre…xes; U.S. legislation that a¤ects U.S. eightdigit codes (imports only); and changes by the Committee for Statistical Annotation of Tari¤
Schedules (known as the “484(f) Committee”) to statistical ten-digit codes.1
HS codes are updated for several reasons. The WCO, for example, makes adjustments to
eliminate six-digit roots that capture little or no trade, with a goal of having trade roughly balanced
across codes. In addition, the 484(f) Committee may may split a single HS code into several new
codes in order to report import or export data at a more detailed level. Similarly, producers may
petition one of the o¢ cial bodies noted above for code changes to obtain a higher pro…le for the
goods they export or import.
3.

Data

Each year, Census publishes documents outlining the HS codes that have become “obsolete”and
the “new”codes that will take their place. We refer to these documents as Census’“new-obsolete”
…les. For exports, HS-code changes take e¤ect annually in January; for imports, they can occur
within as well as across years. New-obsolete …les for years before 1997 are available only in hard
copy and were transcribed into electronic form as part of the construction of our concordance. These
…les as well as electronic versions of subsequent …les were obtained from Mayumi Hairston Escalante
at Census. The most recent new-obsolete …les are currently posted on the Census website.2

Concording U.S. HS Codes Over Time

We use the terms “simple” and “complex” to describe the two basic changes to HS codes that
can occur in a new-obsolete …le.3 Simple changes make no adjustments to the actual items covered
by a particular code, they just swap one ten-digit code for another. There are several possible
reasons for a one-to-one re-numbering, including:
1. To align the Schedule B and HTS codes where Census …nds their descriptions are the same;
2. To di¤erentiate the Schedule B and HTS codes where Census has found them to be di¤erent;
3. To correct errors by reclassifying a commodity under a di¤erent subheading;
4. To maintain the level of statistical detail after a revision of the 6- or 8-digit codes; and
5. To accommodate a new numbering pattern, usually the result of another code being broken
out.
In contrast to simple changes, complex changes alter the mix of items captured by a particular
code. For these changes, the items formerly encompassed by one or more “obsolete” codes are
distributed to one or more “new” codes. In 2002, for example, various types of waste oil, which
previously were grouped with the fresh oils to which they were most similar, were given their own
HS codes. As a result, the (now obsolete) former fresh oil product categories were linked to the
new waste oil categories from which they emerged.
For each set of new-obsolete mappings in a particular new-obsolete …le, we construct a synthetic
HS code which we refer to as a “setyear” (setyr in our Stata code). This synthetic code records
both the count of the change since the …rst change in 1989 and an identi…er for when it takes place.
Formally, for exports, it is de…ned as the count of the particular mapping plus the four-digit year in
which the change occurs divided by 10,000. For imports, it is the count of the particular mapping
plus six-digit year-month in which the change occurs divided by 1,000,000. The very …rst setyears
for exports and imports, for example, are equal to 1.1989 and 1.198906.
Table 1 summarizes the number of new-obsolete mappings in the raw data for export and
import codes, respectively. Results for export codes are displayed in the left panel while those for
import codes are displayed in the middle and right panels. The …rst column of each panel notes the
year-month in which the noted changes take place. The second and third columns report the total
number of retired and replacement codes encompassed by the number of sets reported in column
four. Note that the number of sets in column four is smaller than the numbers of HS codes in
columns two and three because multiple codes are often involved in a particular change. The …fth
column reports the number of changes that are “simple” in the sense outlined above.
As indicated in the table, HS codes are updated unevenly in the sense that some years (e.g.,
2002) encompass substantially more changes than others (e.g. 2000).
4.

Developing an HS Concordance

Concording HS codes over time is complicated by the existence of chains of HS-code changes
across months and years into “family trees”. There are two basic types of family tree. We refer
to the …rst case, displayed in Figure 1, generically as a “growing family tree”. In this case, code a
from period t may become obsolete and be mapped to new codes b and c in period t + 1. Then, in
period t + 2, codes b and c may become obsolete and be mapped to new codes e and f , and g and h,
3
Some new-obsolete …les contain “blanket”mappings, our term for mappings that include codes ending in a series
of X’s, e.g., 8486XXXXXX. We drop these observations.

respectively. Our concordance of the period t to period t + 2 HS codes assigns a common synthetic
code to all HS codes in a growing family tree. Such an assignment may result in potentially many
more HS codes being mapped to a given synthetic code in the …nal year of the concordance than
in the …rst year.4
The second type of family tree, which we refer to generically as a “shrinking family tree”, is
displayed in Figure 2. In this case, codes a and b, and c and d, from period t separately become
obsolete and mapped to codes e and f , respectively, in period t + 1. Then, in period t + 2, codes
e and f become obsolete and are assigned to new code g. In this case, the number of HS codes
mapped to the family’s common synthetic code declines over time.5
The algorithm we develop for concording HS codes between arbitrary beginning and ending
year-months accounts for both types of family trees, as well as combinations of the two types.
Though speci…c details about how the algorithm is implemented can be determined by examining
4

In 1997, for example, 7802000000 is mapped to 7802000030 and 7802000060. In a 1996 to 1997 concordance, we
would assign a single synthetic HS code to all of these actual HS codes.
5
In 1997, for example, 8506800010 and 8506800050 are mapped to 8506800000. In a 1996 to 1997 concordance,
we would assign a single synthetic HS code to all of these actual HS codes.

the Stata code in the Appendix, the basic steps are as follows:
1. Read in raw obsolete-new mappings;
2. Assign a single setyear to each obsolete-new mapping appearing in the raw …les;
3. Choose a beginning and end year for the concordance;
4. Identify family trees extending between the beginning and end years of the concordance; and
5. Assign all members of a family tree the minimum setyear among family members within the
time-frame of the concordance. Note that the part of the setyear after the decimal point
identi…es the year in which the family tree starts (i.e., period t in Figures 1 and 2 above).
In the Stata code below, a separate variable (named effyr) identi…es the year in which a
particular new-obsolete mapping occurs.6
Step four is accomplished by successively merging subsequent obsolete-new mappings to all
periods’ new-obsolete mappings between the beginning and end years of the concordance. To
bridge codes used from 1989 to 2004 for example, the chained …le is constructed as follows. First,
merge the new codes in the 1990 …le to the obsolete codes in 1991 …le, dropping any codes that
are unique to 1991. Second, merge the obsolete codes in the 1992 …le to the new codes in the
previously merged 1990-1991 …le, again dropping any codes unique to 1992. And so on. Note
that this successive merging has to be done starting with every year-month between the beginning
and ending year-month because chains can begin in any year-month, and they would be missed
otherwise given the dropping just mentioned. After these chains are created, they are appended
into a single …le and added to all obsolete-new mappings that are not parts of a chain.

A 1989-to-2004 Concordance

This section describes the 1989 to 2004 concordance used by Bernard, Jensen, Redding and
Schott (2009) in their analysis of the margins of U.S. trade. The …rst and second columns of Table
2 summarize total U.S. exports in 1989 and 2004 and the total number of HS product categories
exported in those two years, respectively. Columns three and four provide analogous detail with
respect to U.S. imports. As indicated in the table, (nominal) exports more than double while
(nominal) imports more than triple over the …fteen-year interval. The number of pre-concorded
export and import HS codes observed in each year of data, by contrast, grow 13 percent and 21
percent, respectively.

For example, in 1998 export code 8531800035 from 1997 is mapped to code 8531804000. Then, in 2002, codes
8531804000 and 8527908015 from 2001 are mapped into 8527908600. The setyr for the family is 1404.1998. The
integer part of this setyr indicates that the …rst mapping in the family, from 8531800035 to 8531804000, is the 1404th
mapping since 1989. The part after the decimal point indicates it occurs in 1998. The effyr for the two mappings
are 1998 and 2002, respectively.

Table 3 reports two decompositions of export and import codes. The …rst three rows of the Table
show how many of the original HS codes in each year survive versus being replaced by synthetic
codes. The remaining rows in the table decompose the actual plus synthetic codes that remain
after the concordance into those which are common across years and those which are idiosyncratic
to a particular year.

Notes: Table decomposes the number of original HS codes in each year into those replaced by a synthetic
code versus not, and total surviving HS plus synthetic codes in each year into noted sub-groups. All
replacements are with respect to a 1989 to 2004 concordance. Even columns display values as a percent of
first row in preceding column.

Of the 7,853 original HS codes appearing in the 1989 U.S. export data, for example, 2,504 are
replaced by synthetic codes. Since the same synthetic code is often assigned to more than one
original code, the resulting concorded dataset contains 6,978 actual plus synthetic codes. Of these,
5,349 and 1,629 are actual and synthetic, respectively. Each of these totals, in turn, can be broken
down into actual codes which are common to both 1989 and 2004 (5,318), synthetic codes that are
common to both 1989 and 2004 (1,624), actual codes unique to 1989 (31) and synthetic codes that
are unique to 1989 (5). These breakdowns reveal that the number of actual and synthetic export
and import goods actually added and dropped between 1989 and 2004 is relatively small.
The values of U.S. exports and imports associated with each of the cells in Table 3 are reported
in Table 4. As indicated below, synthetic codes account for the majority of import value in both
1989 and 2004.

Notes: Table decomposes U.S export and import value according to whether HS codes are original or
synthetic. All replacements are with respect to a 1989 to 2004 concordance. Values are in millions of U.S.
dollars. Even columns display values as a percent of first row in preceding column.

Tables 3 and 4 also underscore the prevalence of changes in HS codes over time. As of 2004,
49 percent of import products and 40 percent of export products had been involved in an HS code
change. Moreover, trade in products with code changes accounted for 62 percent of the value of

Concording U.S. HS Codes Over Time

U.S. imports and 48 percent of the value of U.S. exports in 2004. Tracking changes in HS codes
over time, therefore, is important in any empirical research using international trade data classi…ed
by HS codes, and critical when studying topics such as new product introduction.7

Conclusion

This paper has presented an algorithm for concording ten-digit U.S. Harmonized System (HS)
product codes over time and described how the algorithm can be used to create concordances with
arbitrary beginning and end years. Furthermore, in summarizing the 1989 to 2004 concordance
used in Bernard, Jensen, Redding and Schott (2009) it has illustrated the prevalence of changes
in HS codes over time and the importance of tracking these changes when conducting empirical
research in international trade.

7
We note that two features of Census’ new-obsolete mappings complicate the identi…cation of new product introductions (e.g., iPods). First, new HS codes always emerge from predecessor HS codes. Second, new HS codes’
emergence may take place an unknown period of time after an underlying good has been introduced. Statistical
agencies may wait to establish a new HS category until it reaches a certain size or until manufactures apply su¢ cient
lobbying.

Appendix

This appendix provides Stata code that can be used to create HS concordances. It also describes
the input and output …les associated with this code. These …les are contained in the zip …le
hs_over_time_20090302.zip, which is available on the authors’websites. The two sections of code
below contain our algorithm for creating export and import HS concordances for arbitrary beginning
and ending year-months between 1989 and 2007. Those comfortable with Stata programming should
…nd it relatively easy to manipulate. Those unfamiliar with Stata programming can instead use
one of the output …les described below.
Each program requires as an input a data …le containing the raw new-obsolete mappings discussed in the main text. These input …les are named sch_b_concordances_20081101_02.dta and
hts_concordances_20081101_02.dta, respectively, with the string after the “_”re‡ecting the version date of the …le. The basic structure of these input …les resembles the raw new-obsolete …les,
i.e., each set of obsolete HS codes is followed by the new set of HS codes into which they map.
They are posted to the same website where this paper is found and contain the following variables:
obsolete: old HS codes that become obsolete as of e¤ective date;
new: new HS codes associated with the obsolete codes;
setyr: synthetic code to which new and obsolete codes belong, as de…ned in main text; and
e¤yr: date the mapping is e¤ective.
The …rst two sections of code below produce the output …les that can be used to concord
HS codes in U.S. import and export data, as demonstrated in the last section of this Appendix. Speci…cally, the code produces output …les sch_b_concordances_VER_BEG_END.dta and
hts_concordances_VER_BEG_END.dta, where VER, BEG and END re‡ect user-de…ned version
dates (currently 20081101) and beginning-end years (exports: 1989_2007) or year-months (imports:
198906_200707), respectively. These concordances include the same variables as the input …les, but
with setyr and e¤yr standardized across family trees, as described in Section 4 above. Variables
in the concordance output …les include:
obsolete: obsolete HS code;
new: corresponding new HS code;
setyr: synthetic code linking this mapping to all mappings in its family tree;
e¤yr: year (export) or year-month (import) in which the particular new-obsolete mapping
…rst appears in the raw data.
For those unfamiliar with Stata programming we also provide two additional output …les in .txt
format. These output …les, named setyr_x_1989_2007.txt and setyr_m_1989_2007.txt, provide
a record of every HS code associated with every setyr that appears in the 1989-2007 concorded data.
The …rst column of each …le lists the setyr’s, sorted from low to high. Each additional column lists
the actual HS codes appearing in a particular year of the trade data that should be replace by the
setyr. These actual HS codes also are sorted from low to high in each year. To concord U.S. trade
data from 1989 to 2007, one would just replace all codes listed in the table with the synthetic setyr,
and then collapse the data according to these setyr’s. HS codes not appearing in these output …les
are consistent across all years of the data.
