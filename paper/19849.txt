ABSTRACT
We study a contract change for tea pluckers on an Indian plantation, with a higher governmentstipulated baseline wage. Incentive piece rates were lowered or kept unchanged. Yet, in the
following month, output increased by 20–80%. This response contradicts the standard model and
several variants, is only partly explicable by greater supervision, and appears to be “behavioral.”
But in subsequent months, the increase is comprehensively reversed. Though not an unequivocal
indictment of “behavioral” models, these findings suggest that non-standard responses may be
ephemeral, and should ideally be tracked over an extended period of time.

A BSTRACT. We study a contract change for tea pluckers on an Indian plantation, with a
higher government-stipulated baseline wage. Incentive piece rates were lowered or kept
unchanged. Yet, in the following month, output increased by 20–80%. This response
contradicts the standard model and several variants, is only partly explicable by greater
supervision, and appears to be “behavioral.” But in subsequent months, the increase is
comprehensively reversed. Though not an unequivocal indictment of “behavioral” models,
these findings suggest that non-standard responses may be ephemeral, and should ideally be
tracked over an extended period of time.

We study the productivity impact of a contract change. The setting is a tea plantation in India.
The activity in question is tea-plucking, the output of which is measurable and contractible.
Payments to pluckers consist of a baseline wage, along with piece rates per kilogram of
output that vary over different production intervals. In 2008 a contract change was instituted
as part of a customary practice of renegotiation once every three years. This plantation
represented only a fraction of the negotiating parties, which involved representatives from
some 20 unions and large plantations operating in the tea-growing region, with no dominant

players on either side of the table. Negotiations commenced a few months prior to the
expiration of the going contract, and went through several rounds.
The new contract increased the baseline wage by approximately 30%. Almost all of this
increase was mandated by state government legislation. In June 2008, the government
announced a preliminary notification under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, setting the
minimum daily wage payable to plantation workers in the state at Rs.102 (2.25 USD). The
baseline in force in our plantation was, at the time, Rs.78 (1.72 USD); actually, even lower
if a penalty clause is netted out. The new wage contract, instituted at the beginning of
September 2008, set a baseline wage of Rs.104, and covered over 10,000 pluckers from
different plantations in the same area. From the point of view of an individual worker,
therefore, both the timing and the structure of the contract change can be plausibly viewed
as exogenous.
The new contract also altered marginal incentives. It eliminated an existing penalty for
shortfalls below a minimum “standard.” It left the remaining piece rates unchanged, but they
now came into play at somewhat higher output thresholds. The contract therefore effectively
flattened the piece rate structure, and with it, presumably, incentives. We will presently have
more to say about the contract change, but this description is a good starting point.
Standard principal-agent theory yields an unambiguous prediction for worker productivity:
it must weakly decline. But output per worker increased by over 80%, from 30 kg. per
person per day to 55 kg. between the last week of August, just prior to the contract change,
and September of 2008. As a comparison, the same calendar period for the plantation in
the previous year, 2007, showed an increase from 25 to 34 kg. A “control plantation” in a
neighboring region where no contract change occurred (it was within its three-year contract
cycle) exhibited a contemporaneous increase from 35 to 39 kg. With rainfall and other
controls accounted for, it is possible to temper the increase to some extent, but its substantial
existence is undeniable, lying somewhere between 20% and 40% — depending on the exact
controls used, or relative to the trends in the two counterfactuals just mentioned. This is
interesting because it is apparently opposed to a standard, static model of incentives, which
would imply reduced or at best unchanged effort.
Four main possibilities suggest themselves. First, a static framework may be the wrong
one: dynamic incentives based on contract non-renewal or termination may now have been
heightened. Second, the increase may be driven by enhanced supervisory effort. Third,
there are possibilities of intertemporal substitution in plucking. Finally, notions of gratitude,

reciprocity and gift-giving — “behavioral responses,” in short — might play a role, as
opposed to a monetary payoff-maximizing response to a changed incentive structure.
The first explanation appears to carry no weight at all. Briefly — but in more detail below —
temporary workers, who are hired seasonally, are less responsive to the contract change than
permanent workers, who cannot be fired. The second channel — heightened supervisory
effort — appears to account for some of the increase: around a quarter of increased
productivity. Third, we rule out any significant possibilities for intertemporal substitution
in plucking. We also argue against the existence of learning or nutrition-based channels.
Our conclusion is that the presence of a large “behavioral” response appears undeniable.
That would be the end of the story, were it not for the fact that later observations in the
months following the contract change tell a different tale. Starting around the second month
after the contract change, an output decline sets in, until 4 months after the contract change,
output returns to pre-change levels. The reversal is evident in the reduced form, but to
assess its extent, we estimate a simple structural model from the pre-change data. We apply
those estimates to the data after the contract change. Not surprisingly, our predictions are
far removed from the output distribution observed in the month after the contract change.
This confirms what we’ve already noted: that output in the immediate aftermath of the new
contract departs from any prediction of a standard model. But in subsequent months, there is
significant and steady improvement in the fit of the standard model, and the output increase
(relative to the “standard prediction”) essentially vanishes by the end of month 4. In fact, by
week 17 following the contract change, which is the last period for which we have data, the
standard model works remarkably well.
Our study documents that a contract change in a field setting1 has significant “behavioral
effects” in the short run. Yet, these effects dissipate just as significantly as time goes by,
“ultimately” giving way to outcomes reasonably consistent with the predictions of classical
incentive theory. These findings warn against the claim of dominant behavioral responses
based on outcomes just following a change. Once the euphoria dies down, such effects
may vanish. In particular, we caution against the exclusive use of regression discontinuity
1

Our paper belongs to a growing empirical literature on the implications of the contract form in a natural
employment setting; see, e,g., Shaban (1987), Lazear (2000), Ackerberg and Botticini (2002), Shearer (2004),
Bellemare and Shearer (2009), and Fehr and Goette (2007). Some of this research, most notably, the
contributions of Bandiera, Barankay and Rasul (2005, 2007, 2009, and 2010) are based on experiments in
a field setting that deliberately changed the contract form, often with implications that combine monetary and
social motivations.

methods that emphasize only what happens at the point of the event. Both short- and longterm effects are important, and ideally, we would like to identify both. The way to do that is
to track responses over time.2
Our paper connects with a research program outlined by Gneezy, Meier and Rey-Biel (2011),
who examine “some general aspects of how extrinsic incentives may come into conflict with
other motivations.” They emphasize how the introduction of “extrinsic incentives” (money)
might erode “intrinsic motivations” (reciprocity, gratitude or fair play). That is, in situations
in which the baseline interaction is non-monetary — say blood donations or social work —
financial incentives can cut into and displace pro-social motivations, perhaps with a negative
net effect; see, e.g., Gneezy and Rustichini (2000), and Mellström and Johannesson (2008),
and well as Gneezy, Meier and Rey-Biel (2011), Frey and Jegen (2001) and Charness and
Kuhn (2011), who review the empirical evidence.3
In contrast, our baseline interaction is monetary, and a social component is introduced via the
perceived generosity of the contract change. The immediate response of workers does appear
to be a form of pro-social reciprocity. Yet over time, monetary incentives — the original
foundation of the interaction — ultimately hold sway. That is, not only might monetary
considerations displace social motivations in some settings (as in the earlier literature), but
they may also be hard to dislodge when they are status quo, which is certainly true of most
employment settings.
Section I describes the economic setting, the contract change and the data structure. The
short run response to the contract change and possible drivers for this response are analyzed
in Sections II and III. Section IV introduces the long run response; Section V studies it
structurally. Section VI concludes.

These results from the field echo experiments by Gneezy and List (2006), who find that positive productivity
responses to gift exchange are eroded in a matter of hours, and Bellemare and Shearer (2009), who over a
2-week period find that productivity increases only on the day of the gift. However, some behavioral changes
may well be longer-lived. For instance, the pure framing of incentive bonuses as penalties rather than rewards
appears to have a persistent effect on productivity; see Hossain and List (2012).

It is fair to point out that sometimes there is no evidence that crowding-out occurs; see, e.g., Ashraf, Bandiera
and Jack (2012) and Lacetera, Macis and Slonim (2012). Theoretical research that bears on these issues
includes Benabou and Tirole (2003) and Besley and Ghatak (2005) and is reviewed in Kőszegi (2014)

A. Setting. We study a tea plantation in India, owned by a large producer, in a state
where tea is an important source of employment. This plantation is one of several in the
region, collectively forming the dominant source of employment in the locality. Our study
plantation has over two hundred fields on which clonal tea bushes grow in rows. These are
pruned to form a flat surface, resembling a trimmed hedge, constituting a “plucking table”
approximately one meter tall. This is roughly waist-height for the workers on the plantation,
making plucking less physically arduous and facilitating supervision.
Around 70% of the pluckers in our plantation are female. They typically work full days
or not at all. They are permanently assigned to small “gangs,” composed of about 20–40
members, who tend to a fixed set of geographically proximate fields. Each workday, gangs
are assigned to plucking or non-plucking duties; the latter include pruning, weeding, and the
spraying of pesticides. A gang’s daily job duties as well as field assignments are decided
centrally, by managers. So is the decision regarding whether a given field is to be plucked
using hand or shears. All of this is based on an annually predetermined schedule that is
conditioned on the season as well as a 4-year field life cycle, with minor adjustments for
weather conditions. Each gang has a supervisor, who is paid a fixed wage. (Gang and
supervisor assignment were unchanged after the new contract.)
Fresh, unprocessed tea leaf is manually plucked from the bushes, either by hand or with
metal shears. Leaves are collected in bags carried on the backs of the pluckers; these bags
are weighed and the amount of green leaf plucked is recorded by the supervisor for each
plucker on each day.4 There are no complementarities in production across different workers.
Increased output is therefore a simple consequence of increased individual speed in plucking,
permitting more bushes to be plucked.5
Approximately 65% of the pluckers are permanently employed and have a median tenure
of approximately 21 years. They are entitled to work on all workdays and cannot be fired.
Moreover, the Plantation Labour Act of 1951 stipulates generous non-pecuniary benefits for
all permanent workers, including free housing, health care and children’s education. The
remaining 35% are temporary workers and are hired on a season-by-season basis. They are

Indeed, the supervisor closely monitors this small group, recording each member’s daily activity. That
includes presence or absence, and in the former case, either the non-plucking task to which the worker was
assigned, or the number of kilograms of tea plucked for those workers assigned to plucking duty.
5
An individual plant can also be plucked more intensively, though over plucking can damage later yields. As
we will discuss later, this is not a concern since gangs are made responsible for particular rows in a field,
thereby internalizing this dynamic externality, and also because the majority of workers have at least a decade
of experience.

6

not entitled to the same non-pecuniary benefits. However, all workers receive identical wage
contracts. According to management, absenteeism is idiosyncratic (i.e., not in the form of
coordinated shutdowns or strikes) and driven largely by illness or family obligations.
All told, tea plucking is a pretty routine task. Workers engage in this activity on a daily
basis over the course of years under close monitoring. Contracts are written on an objective
measure of productivity. The company has a considerable history in this industry. It is
therefore reasonable to suppose that asymmetric information regarding worker ability or
effort is not a central consideration here. So the usual complications to standard settings
— such as multitasking (Holstrom and Milgrom, 1991), ratchet effects (Gibbons, 1987) or
career concerns (Gibbons and Murphy, 1992) — are unlikely to be focal in our environment.
Finally, permanent workers cannot be legally dismissed, which makes termination an ineffectual instrument in inducing effort (Dutta, Ray and Sengupta, 1989). On the other hand,
temporary workers can be fired; this distinction will inform part of the analysis below.
B. Contract. Workers are paid a baseline wage on the days they work. Otherwise they
receive no payment. In addition, they receive marginal incentives: piece rates per kilogram
of plucked leaf. These rates vary across different slabs of output, and the thresholds at which
the they kick in (though, as it happens, not the rates themselves) vary by estate-climate type
(we observe two such types in our data) and plucking method. Essentially, in estates with
higher overall month-end yields per hectare, and on days where workers are assigned to
pluck with shears, the thresholds at which larger piece rates kick in are higher. In all cases,
piece rate incomes are calculated on the basis of daily output, and overall wages are paid at
month-end. In addition, the contract stipulates a “base output”, which indicates a minimum
standard that workers are expected to maintain.
The lower curve in Figure 1 depicts a typical pre-change contract. The minimum standard is
shown by s and the fixed daily wage by F. There are three piece rates that apply to different
output slabs. Oddly, the contract has no kink at s: the minimum standard is located “within”
the first incentive slab, and the piece rate to the “left” of s is framed as a penalty. In total,
we observe 4 such contracts in our data, with cutoffs as well as the minimum standards set
higher for shears, or for high-yield estates.
C. Contract Change. This contract, in place since 2005, was renegotiated in 2008 as part
of customary practice in the industry to write a new contract every three years. Negotiations
began 3–4 months prior to contract expiration and went through several rounds. They

involved representatives from approximately 20 unions and employers, with no dominant
players on either side of the table. In the end, 10,000 pluckers from different plantations
were covered by the new agreement. Our plantation had around 2,000 pluckers.
From the point of view of establishing the exogeneity of this contract change to the individual
worker, it is imperative to note that state government legislation effectively drove the increase
in the baseline wage. In June 2008, the state confirmed a preliminary notification under the
Minimum Wages Act, 1948, setting the minimum wage for plantation workers at Rs.101.52
(approximately 2.25 USD at 2008 exchange rates). The daily wage being paid at the study
plantation was, at the time, Rs. 77.55 (approximately 1.72 USD in 2008). Writ petitions
and on-going press reports clearly indicated that owners objected to the new baseline wages.
But petitions by planters seeking a stay on the minimum wage notification were dismissed
by the state’s high court on August 27, 2008. The new wage contract, signed by all parties
and instituted on September 2, 2008, set a fixed daily wage of Rs. 103.76, an increase of

8

RAJSHRI JAYARAMAN, DEBRAJ RAY, AND FRANCIS DE VÉRICOURT

around 30%. In fact, because the penalty provisions for dropping below the standard were
also abolished, the effective increase in the daily fixed wage component was 44%.6
This much is indubitably exogenous, not only to the individual plucker, but — because of
state legislation — to the plantation as a whole. The plantations did collectively react to
the change by a flattening of the piece rate structure. The piece rate for the first slab up
to the standard was now effectively zero, because of the absence of a pecuniary penalty.
This change was the biggest driver of the flatter structure. The piece rates for the remaining
slabs were unchanged at Rs. 0.45, 0.55 and 0.85, respectively. However, the thresholds
at which these rates applied were (slightly) shifted to the right. In conversation, while
emphasizing their commitment to the use of piece rates to elicit effort, planters explained the
flatter incentive structure as an effort to offset higher labor costs imposed by the increased
baseline wage. Online Appendix O.1 provides a simple model that explains such a response.
A typical new contract is shown as the upper curve in Figure 1.
In summary, then, the core driver of the contract change was exogenous to all members of
our plantation, and this is the change in the fixed wage. The new piece rate structure was
arguably an endogenous reaction to this core change. But all said and done, both the timing
and structure of the new contract were exogenous to the individual worker. Of course, that
does not preclude alterations in worker behavior before the (anticipated) change. The data
do indicate abnormally low output in the first three weeks of August 2008, just before the
change. We will deal with this by considering different counterfactuals.
D. Output Data. Our data are obtained from supervisor entries in personnel records for all
employed workers. Our unit of analysis is the worker-day. For days on which workers
participate and are assigned to plucking duties, the observations include the number of
kilograms of green leaf tea plucked by each worker. This one number is our measure of
productivity.
Table 1 describes the basic data structure. In 2008, we have daily observations for roughly
2,000 workers, observed for 5 months: one month prior to the contract change and 4 months
following the contract change. In this and all future tables and figures, Month 0 and Week
0 refer to the month and the week before the (date of the) contract change and Months
1–4 and Weeks 1–17 refer to the corresponding months or weeks following the contract
6

If a worker came in and hypothetically plucked no output, the penalty would amount to Rs. 16–28, depending
on yield class and plucking method. Presumably, there were other non-pecuniary penalties, such as supervisory
pressure, which we will account for in our estimation exercise.

Table 1. Data Structure. Notes. This table describes the number of observations in geographic
locations and time periods for which we have data. The contract change was instituted at the

change. Note that the number of worker-day observations is not necessarily the product of
the number of work days and the number of workers because workers may have been absent
or been assigned to non-plucking duties.7
We exploit two counterfactuals. The first is our plantation observed over the same 5 months
in 2007, the year before the contract change; 82% of the workers in the study plantation
sample are observed in both 2007 and 2008, and within each year, roughly 85% of workers
are observed both in Month 0 and thereafter.8 The second counterfactual is a plantation
located in a hill station at a 100 km. great circle distance north of the study plantation.
This “control” plantation is observed contemporaneously in 2008, but is on a different 3year contract cycle, and did not experience a contract change over the observation period.
Two features make it a good counterfactual. First, it is owned and operated by the same
7

We restrict attention to days on which workers participated and were assigned to plucking duty. The reason for
this focus is twofold. First, when the worker is absent, we do not have any means of knowing to what activity
she would have been assigned. This means that we are compelled to assign a missing value for productivity,
rather than a zero, to such an observation. Second, when workers are assigned to non-plucking activities, there
is no comparable measure of productivity.
8
Hence, participation does not change dramatically over this period. In fact, we will show shortly that it cannot
account for the productivity changes we observe. Moreover, our results are robust to the inclusion of worker
fixed effects.

10

company, and shares the same management, technologies, cropping and labor practices as
the treatment plantation. Second, the natural environment is comparable: the plantations
are located at roughly the same altitude, have similar geological characteristics (slopes, soil
quality, etc.), are subject to the same monsoon cycles, and have almost identical rainfall
patterns over the study period.
As already discussed, workers are permanently assigned to gangs that pluck fields based on
a predetermined schedule and plucking method set by management. There is no endogenous
choice on the part of workers or supervisors regarding plucking method, field, or task
assignment. This allows us to control for field and plucking method fixed effects, as well as
the time-varying intensity with which a field was recently plucked. We correct for rainfall
with an appropriate lag structure discussed later, constructed from daily Tropical Rainfall
Measuring Mission (TRMM) grid cells whose centroid is within 20 km. of the village closest
to the plantation.9

The basic facts are evident from a cursory examination of average daily output over Month
0 (August) and Month 1 (September). Figure 2 shows that output increased sharply in the
treatment plantation in the month after the contract change. No comparable increase is
visible in the control plantation over the same period or in the treatment plantation for the
corresponding time period in the previous year.
The rest of this section establishes the fact of this large increase, by taking care of several
potential confounds. First, as already mentioned, output in the first 3 weeks of Month 0 in
2008 is low, both relative to the control plantation in 2008, and relative to Month 0 in the
treatment plantation in 2007. This low output persists even when we correct for other (timevarying) variables, such as rainfall. In order to avoid the possibility that our estimates simply
reflect an unusually low pre-change output, we restrict our pre-change sample to Week 0 —
the week directly preceding the date of the contract change. Output during this period is
comparable to corresponding outputs in the control plantation and in the treatment plantation
in the previous year. Analogous results using all of Month 0 are even more pronounced, and
are provided in the Online Appendix; see Section O.3 there.

Figure 2. Time Series: Average Daily Output. Notes. The time series depicted in this graph
describe average daily output in the treatment plantation in 2008 and 2007 and in the control
plantation in 2008 for one month on either side of Day 0, the date of the contract change.

Yet even the Week 0 baseline leaves little doubt regarding the change. Figure 3 depicts
marginal densities of daily individual output (top panel), as well as worker-specific scatters
(bottom panel), for Week 0 and Month 1 average output. The first panel is the situation of
interest: output in the study plantation in the last week of August and in all of September
2008. The middle panel shows the study plantation again, this time over the same periods in
2007. The right panel depicts output in the control plantation in the corresponding period in
2008 (with no change in contract). There is a mild increase in output for both the treatment
plantation in 2007 and in the control plantation in 2008 (it is close to the start of the plucking
season), but the jump in the treatment plantation in 2008 is dramatic. Average output
increased by 83%, from 30 to 55 kg. between Week 0 and Month 1 in the treatment plantation
in 2008 compared to a 38% increase from 25 to 34 kg. in 2007 and a contemporaneous 11%
increase from 35 to 39 kg. in the control plantation.10 This is a remarkable increase, and we
will discuss various factors that might bear on it. In this section, we address some of the
preliminary considerations.

Figure O.3 in the Online Appendix shows that both the relative and absolute increases in this and subsequent
graphs are only magnified when one uses all of Month 0 rather than Week 0 as the baseline. Average output
more than doubled from 25 to 55 kg. between Month 0 and Month 1 in the treatment plantation in 2008
compared to a 17% increase from 29 to 34 kg. in 2007 and a contemporaneous 8% increase from 36 to 39 kg.

Figure 3. Kernel Density and Scatter Plots: Average Daily Output. Notes. The top three panels
of this figure depict kernel density estimates for the average daily output of workers in Week 0
(solid line) and Month 1 (dashed line). The bottom three scatter plot depict average daily output
per worker in Week 0 (x-axis) and Month 1 (y-axis). Each dot represents an individual worker.
The solid straight lines in the bottom panels are drawn at 45o . Panel (a) corresponds to the study
plantation in the year of the contract change, Panel (b) to the study plantation in the year before
the contract change, and Panel (c) to the control plantation in the year the contract change took
place. Densities are calculated using an Epanechnikov kernel.

Start of the Plucking Season. August is the first month of the plucking season, and there
is a natural tendency for output to grow as the season picks up. Different estates on the
plantation are more likely to fall under a lower yield class in August, and a higher yield class
in September. This is true of our plantation both in 2007 and 2008. All the estates in the
treatment plantation were under yield class 2 in Month 0, and under yield class 3 in Month
1. We can form a rough estimate of how much output is expected to grow over these classes
by looking at the change in the minimum standard: from 23 kg. to 28 kg. for hands, and 28
kg. to 33 kg. for shears. This is an increase of 18–22%, and it roughly explains the growth

in output in our plantation in 2007 and on the control plantation in 2008. But it is nowhere
close to what happened on the treatment plantation in 2008.
Participation Rates. The scatter plots presented in Figure 3 demonstrate the within-worker
increase in output, conditional on workforce participation. It is also worth noting that there
was no overall change in participation following the contract change. When we estimate a
probit model (not reported) for all working days with a binary dependent variable indicating
work participation on the left hand side and a dummy variable equal to 1 in the period
after the contract change on the right hand side, the coefficient on the dummy variable is
statistically insignificant and close to zero.
Hands Versus Shears. The higher output could reflect an increase in the use of shears in the
month(s) following the contract change, since output is higher with shears than with hand
plucking. However, Figure 4 shows that the change we observe does not simply represent a
technological shift, as output in the treatment plantation increased for both hands and shears.
Additional graphical support — kernel densities for hands and shears, and accompanying
scatter plots at the worker level — is available in Figure O.4 in the Online Appendix. At the
same time, we do need to correct for the possibility of a compositional change from hands to

shears, which could confound a proper estimate of the output increase following the contract
change. We take care of this in the regression analysis below.
Rainfall. The South-West monsoon is relevant for the period under consideration. In our
tea-growing region, it generally lasts through the summer months until the end of August,
contributing to a growth in productivity into September. (As we shall see below, rainfall
is beneficial to plucking, but with a lag to account for increased growth of the bushes.)
The analysis that follows not only takes care of weather patterns, it does so in conjunction
with the possibility that higher output can be attributed to the increased use of shears, the
frequency of past recent plucking, as well as the plucking of different and more productive
fields. We account for all of these together by estimating the residuals of an OLS regression
controlling for field fixed effects, a quadratic term for the number of days in the previous
week a field was plucked by hand and (separately) by shears, as well as time-varying weather
patterns.
Figure 5 depicts the first difference and double difference estimates for Week 0 and Month
1, for various lags of a 7-day moving average of local rainfall. The left panel does this for
the first difference estimate τ1 from the following regression:
(1)

Outputit = α + τ1 Aftert + ψ Controlsi(t) + ρ Rainfallt + εit ,

ANATOMY OF A CONTRACT CHANGE

15

where “After” equals 0 in Week 0 and 1 in Month 1, and “Controls” in this and all future
residual estimates include time-varying field plucking intensity mentioned earlier, as well
as a plucking method dummy variable and field fixed effects. “Rainfall” is entered with a
multitude of lags, ranging from contemporaneous to three weeks; in each case, the estimate
τ1 is recorded on the vertical axes of Figure 5.
The right panel presents the OLS double difference estimate τ2 , recording how productivity
in the treatment plantation in 2008 changed relative to its earlier change in 2007:
(2) Outputit = α+τ0 Treatit +τ1 Aftert +τ2 ( Aftert ×Treatit )+β Controlsit +ρ Rainfallt +εit
where Treatit is a dummy variable equal to 1 in 2008 and the interaction term is a dummy
taking value 1 after the contract change in 2008. Both panels indicate that regardless of
the choice of lag structure, the change in output remains firmly positive following the new
contract. The very lowest increase in output, in the left panel, after accounting for all the
controls is around 12 kg. per person, which represents an increase of 40% (see Table 2 for
a more precise estimate). Figure 5 also shows that an 11-day lag in rainfall yields the most
conservative estimate of the productivity increase. In all future estimates for the treatment
plantation, we calculate the output residuals of an OLS regression with field and plucking
method fixed effects, quadratic terms for the number of days a field has been plucked using
hand and shears in the last week, and an 11-day lagged 7-day moving average of local
rainfall. In the control plantation, our residuals only account for rainfall since we lack fieldlevel data.
Figure 6 plots daily average residuals for Months 0 and 1 in 2008, fitted with a local
polynomial using an Epanechikov kernel.11 The series displays a sharp discontinuity on the
date of the new contract. Regression discontinuity estimates indicate a 4–5 kilogram increase
in output, in the vicinity of 15%, in a matter of 2–4 days; see Table A1 in the Appendix. The
Appendix also plots residuals for the treatment plantation in 2007 and the control plantation
in 2008 (Figure A1).The treatment plantation in 2007 also displays an uptick of productivity
in the region of the discontinuity (see Panel (a) of Figure A1), but the increase is far more
muted: regression discontinuity estimates (not reported) are only half the size of those in the
treatment plantation. In the control plantation, such a discontinuity is entirely absent (see
11

As before, there is a depression in the first 3 weeks of Month 0, but by Week 0 the residuals are approximately
0, which coincides with the Month 0 average residual in the treatment plantation in 2007 (marked with the
horizontal line). Figures O.5 and O.6 in the Online Appendix shows kernel densities and scatter plots analogous
to those in Figure 3, but for residuals thus calculated, rather than output.

Finally, Table 2 presents first difference estimates (columns 1-3) and double difference
estimates (columns 4-5) of equations (1) and (2) respectively, using Week 0 as the baseline,
and including all the controls described earlier. Column 1 includes all the 2008 treatment
plantation observations in Week 0 and Month 1. Column 2 accounts for worker participation
effects by restricting attention to those workers who plucked tea for at least 4 days before
and after the contract change, and Column 3 includes worker fixed effects. The expansion of
output by approximately 12.5 kg. (or 40%) is undeniable across these three first difference
specifications. This estimate is qualitatively similar — at 13.3 kg. — according to the double
difference estimate in Column 5, which uses the 2008 control plantation as a counterfactual.
The double difference in Column 4, which uses the 2007 treatment plantation counterfactual,
yields our lowest linear point estimate, but even this amounts to a 20% increase. (Each
estimate almost doubles when Month 0 is used as a baseline; see Online Appendix, Table
O.1.) The results are qualitatively similar when we control for output outliers. When we
drop either the top 1% or the top 5% of observations in the output distribution, the first
difference results are virtually unchanged. The double difference estimates increase for the
2007 counterfactual and fall for the 2008 counterfactual. All estimates, however, remain
positive and statistically significant.

III. P OSSIBLE D RIVERS OF THE S HORT-T ERM I NCREASE IN O UTPUT
The discussion above establishes that following the contract change, there was an immediate
output increase of a sizable magnitude. We now consider different factors that might bear
on this increase, among them (1) static incentives (2) dynamic incentives (3) heightened supervision (4) intertemporal substitution of plucking effort (5) learning, and (6) “behavioral”
responses.
A. Static Incentives. The new contract raised base wages and, if anything, lowered the
piece rates at the margin. In addition, a penalty for falling below the minimum standard
was removed. Under fairly general conditions, classical incentive theory tells us that effort
and output should not go up. More formally, let w denote the original wage function and
ŵ the new wage function, and let s and ŝ be the minimum production standards in each
case. Assume that the wage functions are continuous and increasing, with bounded slope.
(Typically they will be comprised of a baseline wage and various piece rates, as in our
plantation.) Suppose further that (C1) the wage function shifts up, so ŵ(y) ≥ w(y) for all y,
(C2) it flattens, so ŵ(y) − w(y) is non-increasing in y, and (C3) the minimum standards don’t
go up, so ŝ ≤ s. All three are features of our observed contract change.
The worker’s payoff function is given by
u(w) − c(y) − L(s − y),
where u is increasing and concave in w, effort cost c is increasing and convex in y (with
unbounded slope as y → ∞), and L is a nondecreasing, convex “penalty function” with
L(x) = 0 for all x ≤ 0. Note that the consequence of not meeting the standard is, to some
extent, a choice variable that can be influenced by the employer via supervisory effort.12
The worker chooses effort (or equivalently y) to maximize payoffs, subject to the link
between w and y created by the wage function. Notice that the optimization problem is
not concave even if payoffs have the “correct” curvature, as the wage functions might be
non-concave, and in our setting, they certainly are. So, although an optimum always exists
under our assumptions, multiple optima are possible. Yet, the following result states, roughly
12

We control for all stochastic shocks that are realized prior to the supply of effort, and hence don’t carry these
in the notation. In addition, there is little loss of generality in removing all stochastic shocks after effort is
supplied, because the condition and quantity of the leaves on the bushes are observed at the time of applying
effort. In any case, the approach can directly be extended to more general output functions of the form y(e, )
where y is non-decreasing in both effort e and (random) perturbation .

ANATOMY OF A CONTRACT CHANGE

19

speaking, that no optimal effort under the new contract can exceed any effort that was optimal
before the change.
P ROPOSITION 1. Let y be an optimal output choice under w, and ŷ an optimal choice under
ŵ. Then either both choices are optimal for both problems, or y ≥ ŷ.
This result holds in fact for more general and non-separable utility functions, provided we
impose submodularity restrictions on the interaction between w, y and s. See the Appendix
for a proof.
The proposition formalizes what we would suspect right away: a contract change that
increases baseline wages, flattens the incentive structure, and lowers standards without
changing supervisory effort, should cause a decrease in worker effort. In the specific case
studied here, the main “flattening” occurred because of the elimination of monetary per-unit
penalties below the minimum standard. If supervision could be stepped up to compensate for
this removal (and we argue below that it was, to some degree), the lowering of effort could
be attenuated and even conceivably nullified, but presumably not reversed. This is precisely
why the increase in output following the contract change is of interest.
We will return to this model below in order to estimate some parameters off the data
preceding the contract change. That will allow us to examine just how much of the postcontract variation can be captured by these parameters, especially in the longer-term.

B. Dynamic Incentives. It is possible that the new contract might have been accompanied
by sharper dynamic incentives. For instance, the very fact of higher wages might serve as an
inducement to provide higher effort, using the threat of firing or contract non-renewal, as in
Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and Dutta, Ray and Sengupta (1989).
However, permanent workers cannot be legally dismissed. This is not just de jure, it is de
facto: the median tenure of permanent workers on our plantation is an impressive 21 years.
On the other hand, this fact yields a potential test for dynamic incentives, which involves
the comparison of output responses across permanent and temporary workers. The latter
are only hired seasonally. The significant improvement in contractual terms can therefore
reasonably be expected to act as an “efficiency wage.” If dynamic incentives are indeed at
the heart of the story, temporary workers should be contributing the bulk of the increase in
plantation output following the contract change.

Figure 7. Kernel Density: Average Daily Output by Permanent and Temporary Workers. Notes.
This figure depicts kernel density estimates for the average daily output of workers in Week 0
(solid line) and Month 1 (dashed line), as in Figure 3, but disaggregated by permanent workers
in Panel (a) and temporary workers in Panel (b).

Figure 7 depicts kernel densities analogous to those in the top left panel of Figure 3,
disaggregated by permanent and temporary workers. (For corresponding comparisons using
Month 0, see Figure O.7 in the Online Appendix.) Output for both sets of workers shift to
the right. This does not square with the dynamic incentives argument. Whatever the cause
of the output increase, it applies to both permanent and temporary workers.
Table 3 drives this point home by computing first differences along the lines of equation (1),
carrying out the exercise separately for permanent and for temporary workers. We consider
the specification in which the difference is computed using Week 0 as baseline. (Using a
Month 0 baseline yields estimates for both permanent and temporary worker which are 10
kg. higher than the Week 0 baseline estimates.) Across all specifications, both permanent and
temporary workers increase output in response to the contract change. Indeed, contrary to
what one would expect, the response of permanent workers to the contract change is almost
twice as large as that of temporary workers.

permanent (columns 1–3) and temporary workers (columns 4–6). The estimates compare Week

before and after the contract change, in order to deal with worker selection. Columns 1–2 and 4–

We therefore find it difficult to attribute the output jump to any form of dynamic incentives
connected with non-renewal of the contract. However, it is entirely possible that underperforming workers were pressured in other ways, or exhorted to perform well. This
motivates our next consideration.

wage notification were submitted by planters, but were dismissed by the state’s high court.
Plantation owners were all too aware of the incentive effects of piece rates, but these could
not be raised in tandem with the higher fixed wage: the costs of doing so were perceived
to be too high. It is therefore important to see if other non-pecuniary means of maintaining
effort — supervision, in a word — could have been intensified.
Supervisors are paid a fixed wage, between Rs. 2600–3400 per month, depending on
seniority. They are drawn from the ranks of pluckers, are overwhelmingly female, and
given their long association with the plantation, are intensely loyal. For permanent workers,
supervision is limited to a mix of exhortation to work, coupled with worse treatment of
the worker and her family (within limits, of course, as the workers are unionized), or later
assignment to more arduous tasks.
We impose a natural restriction on supervisory authority. Presumably, supervisors only have
power in the output range below the explicitly announced minimum standard. Any drop
below this minimum is tantamount to a breach of contract, even though the punishments
may be limited. Now consider outputs that exceed the standard, and for which an additional
piece rate is paid. The very fact that a piece rate is paid, to begin with, suggests that outputs
in this zone are to be treated, to some extent, as a “bonus,” and the use of the piece rate
undercuts the possibility of any legal or contractual breach when output varies in this range.
This is perfectly illustrated by the pre-contract use of the term “penalty” below the standard.
If we neglect supervisory authority, there is no difference between a per-unit penalty and a
piece rate, but the very use of the term “penalty” suggests that extra-pecuniary supervisory
authority can be brought to bear on workers in this sub-standard range, and not above.
In short, apart from the monetary inducement of the piece rate itself, it is difficult, if not
impossible, to appeal to a legal contract to coerce a worker to consistently perform above
minimum standards. We therefore adopt the position that supervisory authority applies, if
at all, to the underperformers, and use this conceptual restriction to back out an estimate for
the contribution made by supervision.
Following up on this point, we separate all workers into two categories. Using data from the
period before the contract change, we can see if the monthly average of each worker falls

Table 4. Supervisory Effort. Notes. This table presents OLS estimates for τ1 analogous to
those in Table 2 (with the full set of controls, not shown here) in levels and logs for the 2008
Treatment Plantation, but disaggregated by person-method observations which were below the
standard in Month 0 of 2008 (“underperformance”), and those which were above the standard in
that month (“overperformance”). Coefficients in the top half of the table compare outputs to that
in Week 0, and those in the bottom half, outputs to that in Month 0. The final column denotes
the estimated share of output increase S due to supervision, as given by equation (3). Standard
errors are clustered by day. ∗ p < 0.10,∗∗ p < 0.05,∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

below (“underperforms”) or above (“overperforms”) the applicable pre-change standard.13
Table 4 records the subsequent increase in output coming from underperformers versus
overperformers.
A theory based entirely on supervisory effort below the minimum standard would generate
no output increase at all from the overperformers (simply apply an obvious variant of
Proposition 1). All the output increase would come from underperformers. This isn’t
quite what we see in Table 4. It is true that the output increase from underperformers
is significantly larger in absolute terms (and therefore a fortiori so in relative terms) than
the corresponding increase from the overperformers. It is possible to argue that some of
this effect is surely due to regression to the mean, as the underperformers return to some
steady state of performance. But in light of the fact that we average outputs over an entire
month to define underperformers, we consider this effect to be relatively unimportant. The
underperformers raised their output by approximately 45%, if Week 0 is taken to be the
baseline.
13

August is the first month of the plucking season. The yield class, and therefore the standard, is generally
lower, and this is taken into account when defining under- and overperformance.

24

RAJSHRI JAYARAMAN, DEBRAJ RAY, AND FRANCIS DE VÉRICOURT

Yet at the same time, the overperformers also increased their output. The corresponding
number is 22% for the Week 0 baseline. (The estimates, as usual, double for both underand overperformers if Month 0 is taken as the baseline.) As already argued, it is extremely
unlikely that this increase could come from supervision. Under that assumption we can
estimate the fraction of the increase in Month 1 due to supervision. Say the underperformers
increase by percentage a, while the overperformers increase by a corresponding percentage
b, where a > b. First, attribute none of b, which is all above the standard, to supervision.
Then remove that same increase from the underperformers, which reflects the assumption
that whatever “behavioral response” is driving the overperformers is also driving the underperformers. Attribute the rest, which is a − b, to better supervision. Then the contribution
share from supervision, S, is given by the formula
(
)
q(a − b)
(3)
S = max 1,
,
qa + (1 − q)b
where q is the output share of underperformers in the week or month prior to the contract
change. This is reported as “supervision share” in the final column of Table 4; by this
metric, better supervision accounts for at most a quarter of the output increase following the
new contract.
Admittedly, this number is open to reinterpretation, but to increase it any further, one must
assume either that individuals above the standard were nevertheless coaxed or coerced into
doing better, or that individuals who were below the standard did not exhibit any of the same
behavioral responses as their compatriots above the standard, and were made to perform
better by supervision alone. For instance, if we presume that all of the increase a must be
credited to supervision, then the supervisory contribution nearly doubles, but we are still left
with a large and unexplained gap.

D. Unplucked Leaves and Intertemporal Substitution. Output in the treatment plantation in 2008 was unusually low in the first 3 weeks of August, which raises the concern
that the increased output in September may, in part, reflect the accumulation of unpicked
mature shoots from the earlier period. Some degree of intertemporal substitution is certainly
possible from one day to the next. For instance, Sunday is a holiday and there is a
significant and positive day-of-the-week effect on Mondays and Tuesdays, relative to the
weekly average. However, a basic primer on the morphology of the tea plant in this region
will easily serve to rule out effects lasting for more than 5–7 days.

ANATOMY OF A CONTRACT CHANGE

25

The top of the plucking table has a base of maintenance leaves, above which mature shoots
are harvested by workers. Mature shoots are made up of 4 leaves and a bud. Three of these
(and the bud) are plucked; the fourth “janam” leaf, located just above a “maintenance leaf”,
must be left intact if the shoot is to grow again.14
It is imperative to note that mature shoots must be plucked within 5–7 days, because after this
period, new leaves unfold from the bud. Overgrown shoots (with more than 4 leaves) must
be plucked and discarded: their leaves are no longer tender and they eventually develop
floral buds that hinder commercial use. So, both over-plucking and under-plucking can
damage plant yield, both in the long-term and also within several days, the latter because of
overgrown shoots. It is therefore no surprise that Hall (2000, Ch. 2, p. 48) writes: “Pluckers
barely have enough time to harvest all the leaves from the fast and furious growth of each
bush before the whole cycle has to be repeated.”
This little primer makes it clear that underplucking, far from creating an “renewable
resource” of leaves for future plucking, can actually lower subsequent output, as overgrown
shoots must be plucked and discarded, or the bush pruned. Therefore, low output in August
cannot account for the increased output even in the days following the contract change, let
alone during the entire month.
E. Learning. Perhaps workers were unaware that a contract change had occurred, or
failed to understand the new terms. In the former (unlikely) case, productivity would be
unresponsive to the change. It wouldn’t have increased. As it so happens, the new contract
was clearly communicated and explained to workers by both the unions and the employer.
The most salient feature was the base wage. Of course, workers may not have learned the full
magnitude of its increase until month-end when they saw their paychecks, but the direction
and substance of the increase were obvious in view of public discussion around the wage
legislation. Since this did not affect marginal incentives, however (or at best would have
lowered those incentives under a concave utility function for income), learning the precise
magnitude of the base wage increase should not have raised productivity.
Alternatively, workers may have had an imperfect understanding of the new piece rate
structure. In order to increase productivity, however, they would have had to believe that
piece rates were now higher. This is implausible. Unions viewed a key achievement of the
14

The plantation practices coarse plucking: fine plucking involves taking the bud and just two of the leaves.
Coarse plucking is standard practice in these plantations, with output targeted to the wholesale tea auction
market.

26

new contract as setting the piece rate for the first slab to zero; in other words, doing away
with the “penalty” below the standard. This was the most notable change in the piece rate
structure and was likely to have been widely advertised.

F. Nutrition. A large body of empirical evidence, following Leibenstein (1957), suggests
that at low levels of income, there is a close connection between wages, nutrition, and manual
labor productivity, with low wages perpetuating poor nutrition, which in turn hampers
productivity; see Strauss and Thomas (1999) for a comprehensive survey of the literature.
The dramatic productivity increase we saw following the contract change was accompanied
by an equally dramatic increase in earnings: average monthly wages increased by 73%
between Month 0 and Month 1. This could, in principle, have improved nutritional intake,
feeding directly into higher productivity.
There are three main arguments that run against this nutrition-wage hypothesis. First, while
it is true that daily wages increased, it is equally true that wages — though calculated daily
— are only paid at month end, and local credit markets are highly imperfect. It is extremely
unlikely, therefore, that workers could have borrowed against month-end wage payments,
which themselves are endogenous to worker effort and therefore subject to moral hazard.
Second, on average, earnings prior to the change lie well above the poverty line, which
includes minimum caloric needs. We estimate workers’ average earnings in the month prior
to the contract in 2008 change to be Rs. 2,011; in 2007, it was Rs. 2,132. The rural poverty
line in the state in 2008 was about Rs. 600.A rudimentary census of plantation housing
residents suggests an average household size of 4. Assuming that there are two workers
with similar monthly earnings in each household, this would place all household members
at least at 1.6 times the poverty line. At this level of per capita income, it seems unlikely that
workers were undernourished.
Third, workers may have modest earnings, but they are entitled by law to non-pecuniary
benefits that extend to basic food security. Section 11 of the Plantation Labour Act (1951)
stipulates that “[t]he State Government may make rules requiring that in every plantation
wherein one hundred and fifty workers are ordinarily employed, one or more canteens shall
be provided and maintained by the employer for the use of the workers,” and that “[such]
rules may provide for . . . the foodstuffs which may be served therein and the charges which
may be made therefor.” Our study plantation, with almost 2000 workers, clearly falls under
the purview of this law. Indeed, as far as the plantations are concerned, the state government

ANATOMY OF A CONTRACT CHANGE

27

stipulated rules in 1955 requiring that food be provided in canteens on a non-profit basis.
While the company has discretion regarding the range of food on offer, the non-profit
requirement puts an upper bound on prices. Quite apart from this legal requirement, the
company has a strategic interest in ensuring that workers are not under-nourished, given
their long-term employment relationships.
G. Behavioral Responses. Our tentative conclusion is that the remaining gap must be
chalked up to “behavioral responses.” Our data do not permit us to identify a specific mechanism within this category, but some explanations seem more likely than others. Income
targeting, for example, seems unlikely. In the month following the contract change, average
earnings were Rs. 2,907. This represents an 73% increase over average monthly earnings
prior to the contract change. Short of clinging to the dubious assertion that earnings targets
increased by over 70% following the contract change, income targeting is an implausible
explanation.
The sharp increase in monthly earnings is mainly due to the 44% increase in the fixed
component of daily wages. increase in the baseline wage. That wage increased by 30%
and the zero piece rate for the first slab added an additional 14 percentage points to this,
amounting to a 44% increase in the fixed component of daily wages. This was a large
increase, and it may have served to render the baseline wage more salient; see Englmaier,
Roider and Sunde (2014) for evidence on productivity responses to the salience of particular
contractual features. Yet, increased salience of the fixed wage component cannot serve alone
to increase effort: if utility is concave in income, it can only dampen effort, or at best leave
it unchanged.
On the other hand, workers may well have responded by increasing their effort in the spirit
of gratitude or reciprocity. As a counterargument, it could be pointed out that the 30%
base wage increase was effectively mandated by minimum wage legislation, exceeded 3year inflation (since the last contract) by only about 5 percentage points, and could therefore
hardly be interpreted as an act of generosity by the owners. However, doing away with the
penalty was not required by law and it increased the effective fixed wage by an additional
14%, so workers may well have perceived this as a gift. It also seems plausible that these
factors influenced underperformers more than overperformers. They may have been more
likely to feel underpaid and therefore more likely to respond positively to a perceived gift; see
Cohn, Fehr and Goette (2014). Alternatively, they experienced a more generous proportional
wage increase, and so may have been “more than proportionately” grateful.

28

RAJSHRI JAYARAMAN, DEBRAJ RAY, AND FRANCIS DE VÉRICOURT

The “perceived generosity” argument also squares with the observation that permanent
workers responded more strongly than temporary workers (recall Table 3). Any argument
based on dynamic incentives would have gone the other way. For permanent workers, the
contract change implies a larger change in permanent income and therefore a more generous
act, compared to temporary workers who received the same contract, but with no guarantees
after the expiry of their term. Permanent workers, who have a long-term relationship with the
employer, are both well-aware of the increased costs the new contract imposes on the owners
and may be more likely to perceive the substantial wage increase as being pro-social. Both
these factors may also explain their differential response relative to temporary workers; see
Hennig-Schmidt, Sadrieh and Rockenbach (2010) and Hossain and Li (2013), respectively.
Other behavioral explanations are possible, and are consistent with a larger relative response
for underperformers. For instance, workers might derive utility from a positive bonus, over
and above their utility for money. That would have induced larger responses from lowend workers. Or perhaps those workers responded positively to the removal of the penalty.
Finally, it is possible that the short-term increase was a Hawthorne effect of some kind
(Mayo, 1933, Ch. 3); specifically, a “novelty effect” (Clark and Sugrue, 1991, p.333). These
are references to generally positive but often temporary gains in productivity when a novel
change occurs in the workplace. In short, we can’t pin down the exact form of the response,
and indeed, with the plethora of effects that go under the rubric “behavioral,” it would be
difficult to do so except under highly controlled conditions. Yet our elimination of the
usual “non-behavioral” suspects leaves us comfortable with the conclusion that “behavioral
effects” — black-boxed though they may be — played a role in the output increase.

IV. P RODUCTIVITY R ESPONSE IN

THE

L ONGER T ERM

If our data were limited to this immediate post-contract period, the overall impression would
be one of a rather dramatic and counterintuitive increase in output. The increase is robust
to the inclusion of various controls, it flies in the face of the dampening of marginal static
incentives, it is not explicable by the use of dynamic incentives such as firing threats, and
increased supervisory effort explains at best a fraction of the overall change. We are left,
then, with the intriguing hypothesis that a “behavioral” response took place following the
contract change, one that reciprocally rewarded a better deal with higher effort. We have
discussed these matters in some detail in the previous section.

plantation in 2008, accounting for rainfall and other controls. The horizontal line denotes average
output in Week 0 in the treatment plantation in 2008. Panel (b) presents estimates of weekly first
differences relative to week 0, for each week following the contract change, until Month 4.
Dashed lines show the 95% confidence interval.

We now ask a different question: for how long did the response last? Fortunately, we have
data on worker productivity for up to 4 months into the new contract; that is, to the end of
the annual plucking season. Our findings can be summarized in a single sentence: the output
differential reversed itself in the months that followed, with most of the increase eroded by
Month 4.
Figure 8 plots residuals; it extends Figure 6 to four months after the contract change. The
horizontal line in the first panel denotes average Week 0 residual in 2008, which is almost
identical to the average residual in the treatment plantation in Month 0 of 2007 and in the
control plantation in Month 0 of 2008. This panel plots the daily residuals to Month 4. It
shows that the Month 1 productivity response persists through the second half of Month 2,
but then tapers off until, by the end of Month 4, output retreats to the levels in the week
before the contract change. In contrast, as already mentioned, Figure A1 in the Appendix
shows no jump with subsequent reversion for the daily residuals in the treatment plantation
in 2007 and the control plantation in 2008. Moreover, by Month 4, these residuals from the
two time series are at similar Month 4 levels compared to the treatment plantation in 2008.
The phenomenon we uncover is clearly specific to the treatment plantation in 2008: there is

This figure presents estimates of double differences by week—the vector ω2 in equation (5)—for

and Panel (b) uses the treatment plantation on the corresponding dates in 2007. Dashed lines

a Month 1 jump, which reverses by the end of Month 4, both in itself and relative to our two
counterfactuals.
The second panel of Figure 8 provides estimates for the vector ω1 in the following equation:
(4)

Outputit = α + ω1 Weekt + ψ Controlsi(t) + ρ Rainfallt + εit ,

where Weekt is a vector of 17 dummies, one for each of the calendar weeks following the
contract change, the exclusion being Week 0. The coefficients on these dummies record how
output in each subsequent week changed relative to Week 0; see Column 1 of Table A2 in
the Appendix for the estimates. There is a clear downward trend in the coefficients after
the initial spike in weeks 2–5, and in the last week of observation, the increase is no longer
statistically significant.
We follow up this line of reasoning with two more pooled OLS regressions that consider all
observation days from Week 0 onward for 2008 and two explicit counterfactuals: the control
plantation on the same dates in 2008, and the treatment plantation on the corresponding dates
in 2007. Figure 9 presents the point estimates for the vector ω2 in the following regression:
(5) Outputit = α+ω0 Treatit +ω1 Weekt +ω2 (Weekt ×Treatit )+β Controlsit +ρ Rainfallt +εit

ANATOMY OF A CONTRACT CHANGE

31

where Treatit is a dummy variable equal to 1 in the treatment plantation in 2008. Once again
the exclusion is Week 0. The double difference estimates of ω2 in Figure 9 are entirely
consistent with the first difference estimates in Figure 8. The increase — relative to either
counterfactual — is large and significant in the initial weeks following the contract change,
but it decreases in later periods. In the last two weeks before the end of the season, the
increase is no longer statistically significant. See Columns 2 and 4 in Table A2 in the
Appendix for the double difference coefficient estimates.
For a separate take on the attenuation of the output increase, Figure A2 in the Appendix
depicts kernel densities of daily residuals — not just averages — in weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16
after the contract change. These are compared to the corresponding distribution of residuals
in Week 0. Notice that the two densities are very different in the first panel, but the difference
then dissipates in subsequent weeks. The decline is true of both permanent and temporary
workers: there is no evidence that dynamic incentives induce temporary workers to exert
more effort than permanent workers in either the short or the long run; see Table A3 in
the Appendix. In fact, by Week 8, the response for temporary workers turns negative and
remains more or less so until the end of the observation period.
We are going to argue that this reversal is fundamentally due to an erosion of the short-term
behavioral response. We make this case in three steps. First, we recall from Section III.C
that the initial output increase could perhaps be partly explained by heightened supervision.
A decline in supervision could therefore explain a part of this reversal, but only a part. In
fact, over the subsequent three-month output decline, the relative contribution of supervision
appears to increase, which suggests that the “behavioral” response dies faster than supervision does. Table A4 in the Appendix continues the estimates in Table 4 for the treatment
plantation in later months. We retain the same classification into “underperformers” and
“overperformers,” but extend Table 4 to the full observation period by regressing output on
a full set of controls, along with weekly dummies starting from Week 1, the exclusion being
Week 0, separately for overperformers and underperformers. Column 5 in Table A4 presents
week-by-week supervisory effort estimates, calculated from the weekly dummy coefficients
for these sub-samples. The table shows that the relative contribution of supervisory effort
tends to increase over the observation period. Our estimates of supervisory contribution
climb from around a quarter in the month following the contract change, to a half in the last
month of observation.

32

RAJSHRI JAYARAMAN, DEBRAJ RAY, AND FRANCIS DE VÉRICOURT

Second, it might be argued that the decline in output from Month 2 onwards is the
consequence of exuberant plucking in Month 1, which lowered subsequent plant yields
in subsequent months. The general point is related to our discussion on intertemporal
substitution in Section III.D, where we worried that underplucking in an earlier period may
provide a more abundant yield in subsequent periods. We ruled that possibility by invoking
the morphology of the tea plant: this could not happen because the plant yields would be
lower and not higher in September if they were under plucked in the first few weeks of
August. Here by contrast workers could, in principle, overpluck the plant today, thereby
lowering its yield in the future.
But work organization allows us to safely rule out this eventuality. Recall from Section I.A
that within a given field workers are always assigned to the same row(s) of bushes. This
is explicitly designed to preserve dynamic incentives: if, indeed, a worker overplucked a
bush in Month 1, she would suffer directly from lower yields in subsequent periods. This
disincentive for overplucking would be diluted if gangs rotated through completely different
fields over the course of time, rarely, if ever, returning to the same field, compelling workers
in different gangs to pluck the same rows. This is not the case. As described in Online
Appendix O.2, the data are consistent with each gang being assigned to an exclusive set of
fields.
In the third and final step, we argue for the erosion of behavioral responses by estimating an
entirely standard model off the pre-change data, and using those estimates to predict postchange output. As we shall see, by Month 4 the standard model does well in explaining the
observed distribution of output. This exercise is conducted in the next Section.

V. A S TRUCTURAL A PPROACH TO U NDERSTANDING P OST-C ONTRACT O UTPUT
We’ve seen so far that the large output increase in Months 1 and 2 ebbs away in Months 3
and 4, and by the end of Month 4 we are down to practically no increase at all. At this point
the data cease. Whether the ebb continues in later periods is not something we can directly
observe.
Where might theory stand on this matter, using a simple, static model of incentives? Recall
that the main flattening of the incentive structure came from the elimination of monetary
penalties below the minimum standard, which were just piece rates in disguise. The
remaining changes pertained to relatively minor shifts in output thresholds for the payment

ANATOMY OF A CONTRACT CHANGE

33

of (unchanged) piece rates. So the basic model would predict roughly unchanged effort
above the minimum standard, with a decline below the standard if supervisory effort were
unchanged. With an increase in supervison to counteract the removal of the penalty, it would
not be out of line to predict that output should remain unchanged.15 Based on this discussion,
our best guess is that by the end of Month 4, the simple model of incentives in Section III.A
could apply quite well. We now back up that assertion by estimating the parameters of a
simple structural model off the pre-contract data, and applying those parameters to predict
the “out-of-sample” post-contract outcomes.
A. Approach. We place more structure on the model of Section III.A. First, we suppose u
is linear; specifically, that u(w) = w. That is, we ignore the income effects from the change
in the baseline wage, and concentrate entirely on marginal incentives. Second, we write the
cost function as
µ


exp θy − 1 ,
θ
where µ is a shock observed before the effort (or output) decision is made, and θ controls
the curvature of effort disutility. We presume that µ is drawn from a gamma distribution,
the shape and scale parameters of which will form part of the estimation exercise. Next, we
suppose that
(6)

(7)

c(y, µ) =

L(x) = max{βx, 0},

where x is the shortfall s − y in output from the contractually stipulated standard, and β is the
pecuniary equivalent of the unit cost for falling below the standard. With linear u, we can
fold β into the piece rate structure. Thus, under the old contract, workers face an effective
piece rate of w0 ≡ β+0.40 up to the minimum standard q1 = s, where Rs. 0.40 is the per-kilo
monetary penalty for dropping below s. The next piece rate is w1 = 0.40, defined on [s, q2 ),
followed by w3 = 0.55 on [q2 , q3 ) and w4 = 0.85 on [q3 , ∞). The combined effective piece
rates and thresholds are summarized for the relevant yield classes (which are 2 and 3, yield
classes 1 and 4 not being observed) in Table 5. To complete the description of the wage
function, we must recall the baseline wage, which is given by Rs. 77.55. This fixed wage is
now effectively 77.55 − (0.40 + β)s. Call the full wage function described here w(y).
15

This discussion neglects possible income effects on effort that could arise because of the hike in the baseline
wage. We ignore them, as we are dealing with low-income workers, and indeed, in the model we estimate, we
presume that utilities are linear in consumption.

Table 5. Incentives for Yield Classes 2 and 3 (Hands and Shears) Under the Old Contract.
Notes. This table describes the piece rates for yield classes 2 and 3 under the old contract, and
thresholds at which they became active. (Classes 1 and 4 were not observed.) Each threshold
qi is four numbers, one for each yield class and plucking method. Effective piece rates for each
of the incentive slabs, with rounding to the nearest kilogram, are defined on [qk , qk+1 − 1] for
k = 0, 1, 2 and [q3 , ∞). The slab [q0 , q1 − 1] = [0, s − 1] has an effective piece rate of 0.40 + β,
where β is the coefficient on the loss function below the standard.

We estimate four parameters: β (the loss below minimum standard), θ (the curvature of
effort disutility), and the two parameters defining the gamma distribution for the shock µ.
These are the minimum degrees of freedom that are needed to fit the data: in particular, the
random shock µ captures both a description of individual types as well as any additional
idiosyncratic shocks that an individual might experience before she chooses her effort.16 To
this end, consider the individual’s effort choice problem: for each realization µ, choose y to

The data has positive output realizations for all workers. Therefore, a necessary (but not
sufficient) first order condition must hold for every output not exactly at s or at any of the
other thresholds:
w(y) −

(8)

wi = µ exp(θy),

whenever y lies in the slab (qi , qi+1 ), where we set q4 = ∞, and where the wi ’s are defined
as above. This is the first step that informs the estimation: data on individual output yit
permit us to back out which effective piece rate wi applies to each individual, except for
the value of β. But there is a potential identification problem which we must address at this
stage. The problem has to do with the interchangeability of θ and µ. Given any observed
distribution of outputs, we can “explain” that distribution by choosing a relatively narrow
distribution for µ and a correspondingly small value of θ which imparts enough elasticity
in effort responses to traverse the space of observations. But we can, if we wish, choose a
more diffused distribution for µ, provided that we increase the disutility curvature by raising
θ. This is the sense in which the first-order condition alone may fail to pin down both θ and
the distribution of µ; note how µ and exp θ are multiplicatively related in (8).
Two restrictions help us avoid this identification problem. The first is an additional optimality condition: there must be no “global deviations” to other incentive slabs even when
the first-order condition (8) on a particular slab applies. Figure 10 explains. The first-order
condition is met at y∗ , but for global optimality the indifference curve that is tangent to the
wage function at y∗ must lie everywhere above the wage function elsewhere: this imposes a
separate restriction on curvature θ which cannot be “exchanged” with µ. Second, we impose
the parametric restriction that µ comes from a gamma distribution. This distribution is both
extremely flexible — much more so than the more commonly used (log) normal family —
but it still prevents µ and θ from freely “substituting” for each other in the cost function is
as described in (6), thereby facilitating identification of each parameter separately. Once θ
and the distribution of µ are pinned down, β can be backed out easily from the distribution
of observed outputs below the minimum standard s.

B. Estimation. Here are the details of the estimation strategy, which uses only 2007 data
from roughly 2,000 workers in the treatment plantation:

36

RAJSHRI JAYARAMAN, DEBRAJ RAY, AND FRANCIS DE VÉRICOURT

1. Estimate µ. Fix θ and β. For each contract, characterized by a yield-class/pluckingmethod combination k = 1, . . . , 4, and for each worker j, use equation (8) to estimate
the mean and variance of µ( j, k), and so the scale and shape parameters for the gamma
distribution that determines µ(j, k).
2. Simulate 2007 output. For each worker j and each class-method configuration k, draw
µ(j, k) from the gamma distribution in Step 1. For each output slab i of the form [qi , qi+1 ), we
know the marginal piece rate (because β is fixed from Step 1) and so can calculate the level
of output yij that solves equation (8). Check to see if the y∗i j lies in the slab i. If so, keep the
value, otherwise return a missing value. It is easy to prove that for some slab(s), there must
be non-missing values. For each slab i with non-missing value y∗i j , calculate worker payoff.
If all payoffs are negative, set output y∗j = 0. Otherwise, the chosen y∗j is that value of yi j
corresponding to the highest (positive) utility.
3. Iterate and average. Repeat Step 2 for 50 random draws of µ(j, k), and calculate the
average optimal output over these 50 draws for each individual j under each contract k.
Calculate the proportion of days in 2007 that j spent under each contract k. Apply these
weights to the average individual output under each contract to calculate a weighted average
output.
4. Choose best fit. Repeat Steps 1–3 for 200 possible values of θ and β corresponding
to the 0.1 point grid (θ, β) = {(0.1, 0.1), .....(2, 1.0)}. Choose (θ, β) so that the empirical
distribution of the simulated data most closely resembles the 2007 data according to two
criteria: a t-test of the difference in means, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff distance statistic
D = sup y |F(y) − G(y)|, which is the supremum of the absolute distances between the actual
cumulative output distribution F and the simulated cumulative output distribution G. Figure
A3 in the Appendix shows that the D-statistic is minimized and the mean difference in output
is closest to 0 at (θ, β) = (0.9, 1).17 In addition, t-tests for the null hypothesis of equal means
in the simulated and actual distributions for different values of (θ, β) indicate that only for
θ = 0.9 is the p-value different from zero. Moreover, the p-value reaches its maximum at
(θ, β) = (0.9, 1.0); see Online Appendix Table O.4. (The p-value falls for larger values of β
with θ = 0.9; not reported.) We therefore set (θ, β) = (0.9, 1).
Figure 11 compares the output predicted by the structural model under the old contract for
(θ, β) = (0.9, 1) with the actual 2007 data. Table 6 presents summary statistics comparing

C. Predicting Output Post-Change. The contract change generates a new effective wage
function. Table 7 summarizes it. We now use our estimated model to predict the postchange distribution of output. Specifically, we set (θ, β) = (0.9, 1.0) and take 100 random
draws of µ(j, k) from the corresponding gamma distribution for each (j, k). For each draw, we
calculate the optimal output y∗j as in Step 2 of the previous section, but under the parameters
of the new contract. We then calculate the average individual output over the 100 draws
under each possible contract and construct a weighted average across contracts, where the
assigned weights are equal to the proportion of days the individual spent under each contract
following the contract change. This weighted average is our prediction of individual output
under the new contract.
Figure 12 compares the predicted distribution under the new contract to the actual distribution in 4-week intervals—for Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16—following the contract change. By
week 16, we see almost complete convergence to the predicted distribution.

Table 7. Incentive Slabs for Yield Classes 2 and 3, Hands and Shears Under the New Contract.
Notes. This table describes the piece rates for yield classes 2 and 3 under the new contract, and
thresholds at which they became active. (Yield classes 1 and 4 were not observed on any estates.)
Each threshold q̂i is four numbers, one for each yield class and plucking method. Effective
piece rates for each of the incentive slabs, with rounding to the nearest kilogram, are defined
on [q̂k , q̂k+1 − 1] for k = 0, 1, 2 and [q̂3 , ∞). The slab [q̂0 , q̂1 − 1] = [0, ŝ − 1] has an effective
piece rate of β, where β is the estimated coefficient on the loss function below the new standard
ŝ. There are no longer any monetary penalties in this range.

Figure 13 shows deviations of actual output from the mean predicted output of the structural
model. Panel (a) compares weekly averages. In the first 4 weeks following the contract
change, output is approximately 20 kg. higher than predicted by the structural model. This
difference drops by a half to about 10 kg. between weeks 5-8, and again by a half to roughly
5 kg. in the subsequent 7 weeks, until by week 17 — the last week of observation — the
prediction of the structural model is statistically indistinguishable from the actual output at
the 5% level. Panel (b) shows the deviation of actual output from the mean predicted output
of the structural model, in terms of 2-day averages (i.e. for a bin size of 2). There is a sharp
initial increase in Month 1 following the contract change, and then a gradual tapering down,
which seems to converge to around 5 kg. deviation in Month 3, but drops again in Month 4.
In the last week of observation, the predictions of the structural model coincide with actual
output.
Our structural exercise underlines and supports the earlier observation that an output response, although initially quite dramatic, fades away in the succeeding months. What
this exercise adds to the previous observations is that a standard and parsimonious static
model of incentives does a remarkably good job in predicting output following the contract
change, once a few months have passed. It does underperform observed output just after
the contract, though, so this is not at all to say that the initial, sizable jump in output
is uninteresting. It is in fact particularly interesting from a behavioral perspective, as we
have argued. Nevertheless, our longer-term analysis places that initial jump in context: the
behavioral response is eroded as the standard economics of moral hazard appears to reassert

its dominant position. It is in this sense that our study warns against placing excessive
emphasis on “behavioral responses,” a response that may well be significant in the immediate
aftermath of a contract or policy change, but not in the longer term.

VI. C ONCLUSION
This paper studies the productivity impact of a contract change for tea pluckers in an Indian
plantation. The contract raised the baseline wage by over 30%, but lowered marginal
incentives by eliminating a linear penalty for underperformance, and (less significantly) by
applying the existing piece rates at higher output thresholds. In the one month following
the contract change, there is a dramatic increase in productivity. It is robust to all sorts of
controls, including plucking method and field type. This is a surprising result, and appears
to directly contradict the predictions from a standard principal-agent model based on agent
moral hazard.
The first part of the paper documents this output increase, and attempts to understand it.
There are several possibilities that we attempt to account for. One possible explanation is that
the contract change represented a large payoff increase to the workers, and therefore could
have served as a dynamic efficiency wage, with contract termination acting as a now stronger
threat. The data do not square with this hypothesis for two reasons. First, most workers
are permanent and cannot be fired by law. Second, the positive productivity response of
temporary workers is considerably lower than than of permanent workers.

ANATOMY OF A CONTRACT CHANGE

41

A second hypothesis is that managers stepped up their supervisory effort, essentially replacing monetary incentives by exhortations, encouragement, coercion and threat (though
as we’ve argued, these last two items are limited in scope and they would have had
different impacts on temporary versus permanent workers). We can address this question
by studying the subset of workers who fell under the minimum standard before the contract
change, and see whether these “underperformers” increase their output more sharply than the
“overperformers” — those who were performing above the standard. Here we do perceive
a difference. The percentage increase in the output of underperformers does exceed that of
the overperformers, so it seems likely that heightened supervision has some role to play.
We estimate that supervision accounts for about a quarter of the output increase, but a large
fraction of the increase is still unaccounted for.
We discuss and eliminate other possibilities, such as intertemporal substitution of unplucked
leaves, learning effects, or nutritional effects on productivity. That leaves us with a
“behavioral response” of some kind. Perhaps workers felt the new contract was a form of
“gift exchange” (Akerlof (1982), Fehr, Goette and Zehnder (2009)) or was otherwise “fair”
(Akerlof and Yellen, 1990), or raised morale (Solow, 1979). Our data do not permit us to
identify a specific mechanism within the behavioral category, but some explanations seem
more likely than others. (Income targeting, for example, seems unlikely.) It also seems
plausible that these factors influenced underperformers more than overperformers. They
experienced a more generous effective proportional wage increase than overperformers. As a
result, they may have been “more than proportionately” grateful, and indeed, they do respond
more than proportionately.
But the second part of the paper documents a reversal. In subsequent months the initial
increase in output is comprehensively eroded. Four months after the contract change, the
increase is muted and in the last two weeks, it appears to vanish altogether. At this point,
our data end. It is entirely possible that the output reversal could have continued. The basic
theory predicts either a decline of effort, or no change if supervisory effort was stepped up,
which appeared to have been the case. At any rate, the increase is attenuated enough so
that an entirely standard model with no behavioral or dynamic features that we estimate off
the pre-change data, fits the observations four months after the contract change remarkably
well.18
18

In the 5 month period that we study here, there is no significant change in worker participation. As such,
this model does not account for selection effects. It is possible that in the longer-run the new contract, with

42

These findings speak to the importance of examining responses to a policy change, not
just immediately after the change but for a substantive period of time afterward. Our
study suggests that classical monetary incentives ultimately dominate, despite a possibly
“behavioral” response in the shorter term. More generally, our findings speak to a literature in behavioral economics that emphasize both the interaction between “intrinsic” and
“extrinsic” motivations, as well as the dynamic evolution of those motivations following a
policy change; see Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) and Gneezy, Meier and Rey-Biel (2011).
This literature emphasizes how the introduction of the financial incentives might erode more
social incentives (reciprocity, gratitude or fair play).
In this paper the baseline relationship is an employment contract. The transaction is
monetary to begin with, and gratitude, reciprocity and pro-social behavior are secondary
considerations. Do pro-social motivations ultimately hold sway? It would appear not: they
matter in the short run, but do not persist. Ultimately, in this labor market setting, monetary
incentives come to dominate their non-pecuniary counterparts. This is not to argue that
agents are never driven by notions of the social good, or that loyalty to an employer cannot
be nurtured. But, particularly in markets where the fundamental relationship is delineated
along economic lines, we need to be alert to to the possibility that long- and short-term
effects differ, and consequently to the hurried classification of many important economic
phenomena as fundamentally “behavioral.”

A PPENDIX
Proof of Proposition 1. We prove Proposition 1 for a more general family of utility
functions to which the separable payoff function of Section III.A belongs. Denote by
U(w, y, s) the worker’s utility, which is non-decreasing concave in wage w, non-increasing
and concave in effort (or produced output) y and non-increasing in the standard s. Utility U
includes the payoff consequence of not meeting the standard: as the standard increases, the
pressure on the worker may increase. We further assume that U is submodular in (w, y, s),
i.e. the marginal utility of wages is non-increasing in effort and standard. In particular,
the payoff function U(w, y, s) = u(w) − c(y) − L(s − y) of Section III.A satisfies all these
conditions.
Given a wage function w and standard s ≥ 0, the worker chooses y to maximize her utility.

= U(ŵ( ŷ), ŷ, ŝ) − U(ŵ( ŷ), y, ŝ) + U(ŵ( ŷ), y, ŝ) − U(ŵ(y), y, ŝ)
≤ U(w( ŷ), ŷ, ŝ) − U(w( ŷ), y, ŝ) + U(ŵ( ŷ), y, ŝ) − U(ŵ(y), y, ŝ)
≤ U(w( ŷ), ŷ, ŝ) − U(w( ŷ), y, ŝ) + U(w( ŷ), y, ŝ) − U(ŵ(y) − δ, y, ŝ)
= U(w( ŷ), ŷ, ŝ) − U(ŵ(y) − δ, y, ŝ)
≤ U(w( ŷ), ŷ, ŝ) − U(w(y), y, ŝ)
≤ U(w( ŷ), ŷ, s) − U(w(y), y, s)
≤ 0.
The first inequality holds since U(·, ·, ŝ) is submodular with ŵ(y) ≥ w( ŷ) from (C1). The
second one holds since U(·, y) is concave with δ ≥ 0 from (C1). The third one holds since
U(·, y, ŝ) is non-decreasing, where ŵ(y) − δ ≥ w(y) from (C2). The fourth one comes
This holds for instance when lim y→∞ U(w(y), y, s) = −∞, a condition satisfied under the assumptions of
Section III.A.

from the submodularity of U(·, ·, ·) in the three variables and (C3). The last inequality holds
since y ∈ Y, and is strict if and only if ŷ < Y. Thus, either ŷ ≤ y or if ŷ > y then
0 ≤ U(ŵ( ŷ), ŷ, ŝ) − U(ŵ(y), y, ŝ) ≤ U(w( ŷ), ŷ, s) − U(w(y), y, s) ≤ 0, which implies that

Table A2. Change in Weekly Average Output Relative to Week 0. Notes. Each column records
the coefficient of a different OLS regression. Columns 1 and 3 present first difference (FD)
estimates for ω1 from equation (4) for the treatment plantation in 2008, and columns 2 and 4
the double difference (DD) estimate for ω2 from equation (5). a. DD comparison plantation is
the treatment plantation in 2007, controlling for rainfall and other time-varying characteristics.
b. DD comparison plantation is the control plantation in 2008, controlling for rainfall only. The
absence of additional controls in column 3 accounts for the difference in the FD estimates in
columns 1 and 3. Standard errors are clustered by day. ∗ p < 0.10,∗∗ p < 0.05,∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

Table A4. Supervisory Effort over Weeks 1-17. Notes. This table presents OLS coefficient
estimates for weekly dummy variables—the exclusion being Week 0—in levels and logs for
the 2008 Treatment Plantation. Each column pertains to a different regression, each of which
include the full set of controls. The table compares person-method observations which were
below the standard in Month 0 of 2008 (“underperformers”), with those which were above the
standard in that month (“overperformers”). Column 6 displays the estimated share of output
increase S due to supervision, as given by equation (3). Standard errors are clustered by day.

Figure A3. Kolmogorov-Smirnoff D Statistic and Difference between Predicted and Actual
Mean Output by (θ, β) Combinations. Notes. This figure depicts two statistics testing the
difference in predicted and actual output for 2007. The left y-axis denotes the KolmogorovSmirnoff distance statistic D = sup y |F(y) − G(y)|, which is the supremum of the absolute
distances between the actual and simulated output distributions. A smaller D indicates more
similar distributions. The right y-axis shows the difference in mean output; the absolute value
of this difference is minimized at zero (the dashed line). Each x-axis tick denotes a (θ, β)
combination, where θ values are labeled on the big ticks and the associated β values of 0.1,
0.2, ....1.0 are marked by the 10 corresponding small ticks. For example, the first tick on the
x-axis corresponds to (θ, β) = (0.1, 0.1), the second to (θ, β) = (0.1, 0.2), etc.
