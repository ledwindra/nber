    "abstract": "\n\nWe test whether the ACA dependent care provision is associated with young adults\u2019 propensity to live with/near parents and to receive food assistance. Data come from the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation.  Findings indicate that the provision is associated with a 3.0 percentage point increase in young adults\u2019 living with parents during the period in which the ACA had been passed but the provision was not effective, and a 6.0 percentage point increase during the time between the provision becoming effective and the end of 2013. In some specifications, the provision is associated with reduced use of food assistance.\n\n",
