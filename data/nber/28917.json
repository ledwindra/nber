    "abstract": "\n\nSequential auction models of labor market competition predict that the wages required to successfully poach a worker from a rival employer will depend on the productivities of both the poached and poaching \ufb01rms. We develop a theoretically grounded extension of the two-way \ufb01xed e\ufb00ects model of Abowd et al. (1999) in which log hiring wages are comprised of a worker \ufb01xed e\ufb00ect, a \ufb01xed e\ufb00ect for the \u201cdestination\u201d \ufb01rm hiring the worker, and a \ufb01xed e\ufb00ect for the \u201corigin\u201d \ufb01rm, or labor market state, from which the worker was hired. This speci\ufb01cation is shown to nest the reduced form for hiring wages delivered by semi-parametric formulations of the canonical sequential auction model of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002b) and its generalization in Bagger et al. (2014). Fitting the model to Italian social security records, origin e\ufb00ects are found to explain only 0.7% of the variance of hiring wages among job movers, while destination e\ufb00ects explain more than 23% of the variance. Across \ufb01rms, destination e\ufb00ects are more than 13 times as variable as origin e\ufb00ects. Interpreted through the lens of Bagger et al. (2014)\u2019s model, this \ufb01nding requires that workers possess implausibly strong bargaining strength. Studying a cohort of workers entering the Italian labor market in 2005, we \ufb01nd that di\ufb00erences in origin e\ufb00ects yield essentially no contribution to the evolution of the gender gap in hiring wages, while di\ufb00erences in destination e\ufb00ects explain the majority of the gap at the time of labor market entry. These results suggest that where a worker is hired from tends to be relatively inconsequential for their wages in comparison to where they are currently employed.\n\n",
