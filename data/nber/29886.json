    "abstract": "\n\nEntry represents a fundamental threat to cartels. We study the extent and effect of this behavior in the largest price-fixing case in US history, which involves generic drug manufacturing. We link information on the cartel\u2019s internal operations to regulatory filings and market data. There is a substantial increase in entry after cartel formation but regulatory approvals delay most entrants by 2-4 years. We then estimate a structural model to simulate counterfactual equilibria. Absent entry, cartel profits would be dramatically higher. Correspondingly, reducing regulatory delays by just 1-2 years equates to consumer compensating variation of $559 million-$1.3 billion.\n\n",
