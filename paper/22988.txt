Child Age and Gender Differences in Food Security in a Low-Income Inner-City Population
Robert A. Moffitt and David C. Ribar
NBER Working Paper No. 22988
December 2016, Revised April 2018
JEL No. I1,I3,J1
ABSTRACT
A long literature in economics studies differential allocations of resources to children within the
family. In a study of approximately 1,600 very disadvantaged households with children in three
cities in the U.S. from 1999 to 2005, significant differences in levels of food allocation, as
measured by an indicator of food “insecurity,” are found across children of different ages and
genders. Using answers to unique survey questions for a specific child in the household, food
insecurity levels are much higher among older children than among younger ones, and to be
sometimes higher among older boys than among older girls. Allocations are strongly correlated
with the dietary needs of the child as well as with household structure and the level of family
organization. However, the differences appear only in the poorest households with the lowest
levels of money income and household resources in general, and most differences disappear in
significance or are greatly reduced in magnitude when resources rise to only modest levels.

1. Introduction
A large and multi-threaded literature has examined parental allocations of resources to
different children across a wide variety of areas. The classic Becker and Tomes (1976) study
suggesting that parents provide educational resources differently to children with different ability
endowments set off a significant strand of literature which is continuing (e.g., Behrman et al.,
1982; Cunha and Heckman, 2007; Aizer and Cunha, 2012). Another large strand has studied
different parental food and health allocations to children in developing countries, including
differences across children by birthweight, other health endowment indicators, and gender (Pitt
et al., 1990 is an early study followed by many more). In the U.S., a smaller thread has asked if
parental resources are related to child health (e.g., Datar et al., 2010; Del Bono et al., 2012),
while a sizeable literature has examined differences in parental allocations by child gender,
particularly differences in parental time inputs and other variables that might explain gender gaps
in test scores, noncognitive traits, education levels, and other outcomes (Lundberg, 2005; Goldin
et al., 2006; Raley and Bianchi, 2006; Dahl and Moretti, 2008; Fryer and Levitt, 2010; Bertrand
and Pan, 2013; Durante et al., 2015; Autor et al., 2016; Baker and Milligan, 2016).
This paper contributes to the literature on differential parental allocations to children by
examining whether a child’s “food security,” a variable correlated with child food consumption,
differs by the child’s age and gender in low-income families in the U.S. Differential food
allocations to children have been thought to be primarily a problem in developing countries, not
in a prosperous country like the U.S., yet it is also known that poverty is stubbornly high in the
U.S. and that a large fraction of families is extremely poor, living on very meager resources
(Edin and Shaefer, 2013). Consequently, differences in food inputs across children may arise

among very low income households. We study whether food security differs across children of
different ages and genders in very poor households and whether meager resources impel parents
to make difficult food allocation decisions across children.
A sizable literature exists on U.S. food security, where the term is conceptually defined
as having “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life” (ColemanJensen et al., 2015). The converse of food security, food insecurity, is regularly measured by a
set of survey questions developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1995 and
asked annually since then in the Current Population Survey (CPS). The questions ask if the
adults or children in a household have experienced a range of food deprivations in the last twelve
months because of a lack of money, ranging from mild conditions of worrying about running out
of food to more severe conditions of having to skip eating for an entire day. The USDA has set
specific thresholds of food insecurity based on reports of multiple food intake problems in the
answers to the survey questions (USDA, 2014). Previous research using the CPS and other
surveys that ask food security questions has identified a long list of correlates of food insecurity,
including low income, not owning a home, low levels of education, living in a family with an
unmarried household head and unmarried status in general, minority race-ethnicity status, living
in a household with adults with physical or mental disabilities, the presence of substance abuse in
the family, poor child care arrangements, and disadvantageous parenting styles, among other
conditions (Gundersen et al., 2011; Gundersen and Ziliak, 2014). Triggering events for food
insecurity include shocks to income, job loss, disruption to housing arrangements, and the
occurrence of other crises.
This paper departs from these studies by making use of a unique survey that measured
2

food insecurity for a specific, randomly selected child in a sample of low income households,
permitting an examination of how insecurity varies at the individual child level. Such an
investigation has not been possible heretofore because the standard USDA questions only ask
about food insecurity for the children in the household as a whole. 1
However, while individual food insecurity has not been comprehensively examined in the
literature for data reasons, a related issue about intrahousehold allocations has been investigated,
namely, whether food insecurity differs between adults as a whole and children as a whole. This
can be investigated because the USDA questions are asked separately for adults and for children.
Studies of the data on this issue have led to what is known as the “child protection hypothesis,”
which posits that adults sacrifice their own food security before allowing their children to
experience it. Simple evidence for this hypothesis is that, within families, food insecurity levels
for adults as a whole are higher than those of the children as a whole (Coleman-Jensen et al.,
2015; Kirkendall et al., 2013). The analysis here, measuring food insecurity at the individual
child level, can pursue this question further by asking whether adults sacrifice their own food
security differentially for children of different ages and genders.
The data set for this study was developed from a survey of very low income households
in high-poverty neighborhoods in three large U.S. cities from 1999 to 2005. The sample is a

1

No existing U.S. survey has the breadth of sample or the depth of questions on
individual-level child food security or consumption as the data set we use, including the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) used by Bhattacharya and Currie (2001)
and Nord (2013), or the Child Development Study of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics used
by Woodward and Ribar (2012). Woodward and Ribar only analyzed consumption among
children aged 10-17 and did not examine younger children; they analyzed children’s own reports,
rather than parents’ reports; and they did not consider interactions of gender and age, which we
find to be necessary in our analysis.

particularly disadvantaged one relative to the general low income population. The respondents
were mostly Black and non-Black Hispanic and hence mostly minority, and the survey
oversampled single-mother households and households on welfare (although sampling weights
allow an adjustment for this). While the results presented here cannot be generalized to a
nationally representative sample of low income households, very disadvantaged minority
households in U.S. inner cities are a group known to be particularly vulnerable to a variety of
deprivations and constitute a population of special policy concern. Future research can
determine whether the results found here extend to other groups.
There are several notable findings from the analysis of these data. First, the data are
overwhelmingly consistent with the child protection hypothesis, for adult levels of food
insecurity are much greater than those of the child. Second, the data show strong evidence that
food insecurity is positively correlated with the age of the child, and for both adult and child food
insecurity. Third, smaller but noticeable gender differences in food insecurity appear in the data,
with the strongest effects for adolescents where insecurity (both child and adult) is higher for
boys than for girls. Thus, contrary to the hypothesis in the son preference literature (e.g., Dahl
and Morretti, 2008), the data here imply daughter preference. Fourth, a large fraction of the age
difference in insecurity is explained by differential food needs, consistent with intuition and with
a simple economic model outlined in the paper which shows that individuals in the household
who have higher and therefore more costly food needs end up with a lower probability of their
needs being satisfied. Fifth, age and gender differences are strongly correlated with whether the
household has cash income below the poverty line or is experiencing some form of financial
strain; households with income above the poverty line or not experiencing such strain generally
4

have much smaller, and often insignificant, differences in food insecurity by age and gender of
the child. 2 Sixth, differences in food insecurity by age and gender of the child are much stronger
for households with unmarried mothers than for those with married mothers, and for those
households without established routines like eating together at breakfast and lunch than for
households with such routines.
It would be an interesting question to know whether any of these results extend to the UK
or European countries. The U.S. differs from European countries in its economic, social, and
institutional context. Income inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) in the U.S. exceeds
that in every other European country but Turkey. 3 The U.S. also has a higher relative poverty
rate than every other European country and a higher child poverty rate than most European
countries. Since we find that differentials in child food deprivation by age and gender appear
only for the lowest income households, European countries may not have many households with
such low incomes. In addition, material hardship, including studies of food hardships, also
appear to be considerably lower in Europe than in the U.S. Gábos et al. (2011) estimated that, in
2009, 5.2% of European children were in households that could not afford to feed the children
meat or fish daily, 4.7% were in households that could not afford to feed them fruits or
vegetables daily, and 1.0% were in households that could not afford to feed them three meals

2

Consistent with this is the study by Durante et al. (2015) which found that parents say
they would invest and spend more on girls than boys in a low-resource environment, i.e., during
a recession.

in Bulgaria lived in households that could not afford to provide three meals every day, while
only 0.1% of children in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden
faced these conditions. More research on cross-country comparisons in this dimension would be
useful. 4
The next section discusses the data and presents the basic patterns in the data. The
following section lays out a simple optimizing model of parental behavior to guide thinking
about possible causes, particularly the relative roles of parental preferences for different children
versus differences in individual production functions. The sections that follow examine a variety
of possible explanations for the patterns, including the roles of differential dietary and nutritional
needs, household structure and levels of household organization, and level of household
resources.

2. Data and Initial Results
2.1. Data
The Three-City Study (TCS) was a longitudinal survey of approximately 2,400 lowincome households living in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio. When they were first surveyed
in 1999, each of the households had an income below 200 percent of the poverty line, had at least

4

Although the impact of social programs on food deprivation is not the focus of this
study, the constellation of such programs is the source of other major differences with the U.S.
Redistribution in the U.S. relies largely on a patchwork of in-kind assistance programs, including
several food assistance programs specifically targeted at children, and less on cash assistance,
unlike most European countries.

one child 0 to 4 or 10 to 14 years of age, and was living in a low- or moderate-income
neighborhood. The data constitute a random sample of the population with these characteristics.
In addition, because the study was intended to focus on the children in low-income households
after 1990s welfare reform, one “focal” child in the household in either the 0-4 or 10-14 age
range was randomly selected for special data collection. The households were interviewed three
times from 1999 to 2005. 5 By the end of the survey, the children who were initially 0-4 had
grown to 6-10 and the children who were initially 10-14 had grown to 16-20, thus providing us
with an artificial cohort spanning the full age range of children 0-20 (although we only consider
children 0-18). The survey collected a wide range of information on employment, income,
household structure, welfare participation, characteristics of the focal child’s caregiver (usually
the mother), and food security in each of the three waves of interviews. In addition, the
interview collected data on several variables, including financial strains, “family routines”, and
social networks, not present in most other studies but which will be shown to be related to the
main findings. We select a balanced sample of children who were present in all three waves of
the data, whose caregiver did not change from wave to wave, and who have non-missing values
for all variables used in the analysis. The sample has 1,628 unique children and a pooled sample
size over all three waves of 4,229 children. We conduct sensitivity tests to these sample

5

Children were followed to the extent possible after residential mobility. At each of the
first two interviews, households were asked to provide contact information for other family and
friends who would know their location. Postcards were sent to households in between interviews
to ascertain any change in residential status and any cards returned with a change-of-address
were followed up with either the post office or the contact individuals to determine the
respondent household’s new address. There was sample loss to follow-up (see below) but it is
not known how much of that was a result of residential mobility.

exclusions below. 6
Most of the households were headed by a single mother but a few married heads were
sampled as well. The vast majority of the sample was either Hispanic or Non-Hispanic Black
and hence heavily minority, reflecting the characteristics of the low-income neighborhoods of
the cities. 7 While, as noted above, the income cutoff was a relatively high 200 percent of the
poverty line, the sample was very poor and disadvantaged, with quite low levels of education as
well as poor physical and mental health. 8 While the trends in unemployment rates and welfare
caseloads in the three states over the period 1999-2005 were similar to those in other states, the
findings below should not be generalized to populations other than very disadvantaged, mostly

6

The original sample of children pooled over all three waves has 6,424 child-year
observations (there was sample loss to attrition). Of the 6,424 observations, 314 were dropped
because the child aged out to over 18 by the third wave, 146 were dropped because of a change in
caregiver, 765 were dropped because of missing data on one of the variables used in the analysis
in a particular wave, and 970 were lost to attrition, leaving our final sample of 4,229 observations.
While the sample is balanced on caregivers and children, the exclusion of observations missing
values of the variables varies from wave to wave, making the final sample unbalanced.
7
Details of the design can be found in Winston et al. (1999). The design over-sampled
certain types of households, so a survey weight which adjusts for the oversampling is used in all
data analyses. In addition, there was significant attrition, with only 80 percent of the children
still in the sample by the third wave. The survey weights were adjusted for a few wave 1
observables for this sample loss. In addition, a comparison of the observables used in the
analyses below at the first wave among those who later attrited and those who did not show very
few differences. Finally, an incentive experiment was conducted which paid a random fraction
of the sample a higher payment for participation and had a significant effect on attrition but
showed no effect on unobservable attrition in income, poverty rates, and other economic
variables as of the second wave (Moffitt, 2004).
8
Frogner et al. (2009) summarized the findings on the welfare receipt, employment, and
income levels of the sample. Studies of food security with these data have been conducted
(Depolt et al., 1999; Moffitt and Ribar, 2016) but did not focus on the age and gender
characteristics of the child as this study does. Other studies using the data can be found on the
project website at http://web.jhu.edu/threecitystudy.

Food Insecurity Questions and Creation of a Scale. Since 1995, the USDA has
administered an 18-question module as a supplement to the CPS called the Food Security
Supplement Module (HFSSM). The food security scales, count measures, and indicators from
the HFSSM have formed the basis for official reports of food insecurity in the U.S. (see ColmanJensen et al. 2017 and earlier reports) and are widely used in research. The measures have been
formally validated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Bickel et al. 2000) and have been
shown to be valid in many other countries, including Canada, Russia, South Korea, and the U.K.
(see the review by Melgar-Quinonez and Hackett, 2008). The TCS survey asked caregivers only
a subset of 8 of the standard 18 USDA food security questions from the CPS. The 8 questions
are shown in Appendix A. The first 4 questions are identical to 4 of those in the adult portion of
the USDA battery and were selected to reflect the questions about more severe hardships. The
second 4 were drawn from the 8 in the child-related portion of the USDA battery but were
modified to ask about hardships of only the focal child in the household rather than of all
children. The 4 questions that were chosen were also those concerning more severe hardships.
The 8 questions were asked in identical form in all three waves of the TCS survey.
For households with children, the USDA analyzes the answers to its 18 questions by
summing the number of positive answers and then creating binary variables for whether the sum
is greater than particular cutoffs. The USDA defines “Low Food Security” as answering 3 or
more of the 18 questions affirmatively and “Very Low Food Security” (VLFS) as answering 8 or
more of the 18 questions affirmatively (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2015). The USDA also creates
binary variables for food insecurity among children using the sum of affirmative answers to the 8
9

children-related questions alone. Here we take a broader approach to the definitions by using
both binary indicators based on cutoffs of the sums of the TCS questions, but also using the sums
themselves which are continuous measures of food insecurity. The sums have a larger range
than the binary variables, obviously, and hence contain more variation and should contribute
more statistical power to the analysis. On the other hand, if there are nonlinearities in the
relationship between the covariates and the sums, the binary outcomes might provide more
statistical power if the nonlinearity is strong around the cutoff point. We therefore employ both
binary and summation measures.
As emphasized earlier, we also distinguish between answers to the four food insecurity
questions asked about the adults and the four asked about the focal child. We use six outcome
variables in our analysis below, defined with the following acronyms:
1. VLFS: binary variable equal to 1 if 2 or more of the 8 TCS questions are answered
affirmatively
2. VLFSA: binary variable equal to 1 if at least 1 of the 4 adult questions is answered
affirmatively
3. VLFSC: binary variable equal to 1 if at least 1 of the 4 child questions is answered
affirmatively
4. SUM: sum of the affirmative answers to the 8 questions
5. SUMA: sum of the affirmative answers to the 4 adult questions
6. SUMC: sum of the affirmative answers to the 4 child questions

The first variable, VLFS, represents an approximation to the USDA Very Low Food
Security binary indicator. We do not examine the less severe USDA Low Food Security
indicator because it cannot be distinguished from VLFS with the TCS food hardship items. Our
10

choice of a cutoff of 2 or more for the definition of our VLFS is based on an extensive
preliminary analysis using the 18 USDA questions (in their 1999 survey), which we used to
determine what cutoff should be used for the 8 TCS questions to classify families into VLFS
status most closely to the same way they would be classified if all 18 USDA questions were
used. Our analysis, reported in Appendix B, shows that the cutoff of 2 achieves the maximal
congruence with the USDA measure.
However, because only 4 questions were asked of the adults and of the focal child, and
because the distribution of the answers is concentrated at the lower end of their sum distribution
(see below), we define their binary indicators, VLFSA and VLFSC, as answering at least one of
the questions affirmatively. Finally, the three SUM variables are simply defined as the sum of
the affirmative answers to the 8 questions for the household as a whole, and over the 4 questions
for the adults and the focal child, respectively.
Table 1 shows the means of these six measures for our analysis sample as of the first
wave of the survey. A little under 8 percent of all families experienced VLFS, with a slightly
higher rate among families in which the focal child was a boy rather than a girl (8 percent versus
7.6 percent). Still, the gender difference is statistically insignificant (10 percent level). But the
frequency of food insecurity reports is much higher among adults than for the focal child, with
12 percent of the former reporting at least one problem but only 3.9 percent of the latter. This is
strongly consistent with the child protection hypothesis cited in the Introduction although, here,
the child report is only for one child in the family (more on this below). 9 No gender differences

The economic model in the next section will reinterpret the child protection hypothesis
as a matter of allocating food to the individuals where the marginal product is highest.
11

appear in either the adult or child binary indicators, however. For the variables representing the
sums of the answers to the questions, only conditional means are shown in the table (the
unconditional means are the product of the binary indicator means and the conditional means).
Again, the mean number of reports of insecurity is higher for adults than for children, and the
gap between whether the focal child is a boy or girl widens for the adult reports, with adults
reporting more hardships if the focal child is a boy.
The lower portion of the table shows differences by the age of the child, using three
common demarcations of stages of childhood, 0-5, 6-11, and 12-18. The results are broadly
consistent across all six of the insecurity outcomes and tend to show that food insecurity,
whether for the household as a whole, for adults, or for the focal child, tends to rise with the age
of the focal child. But for the binary indicators, the age gradient is somewhat steeper for boys
than girls. The increase in adult insecurity with the age of the child is inconsistent with a simple
version of the child protection hypothesis, which would suggest that adults protect adolescents
less than young children. But it could also be interpreted as suggesting that food insecurity
among adolescents would be even greater than it is, were adults not to sacrifice some of their
own food consumption. Of course, no other variables have been controlled for yet which might
explain the pattern of adult food insecurity with the age of the child in other ways, including the
number and types of other children in the family.
Gender differences also appear in these separate age means that were not apparent in the
means taken over all ages, but they are not large in magnitude. There is a slight tendency for
insecurity reports to be higher for the youngest girls than for the youngest boys but the opposite
for adolescent boys and girls. However, this pattern is not present in a consistent way for the
12

conditional SUM measures.
2.2. Initial Multivariate Results
We estimate random effects probit models for the three binary outcomes (VLFS, VLFSA,
VLFSC) and random effects ordered probit models for the three SUM variables (SUM, SUMA,
and SUMC), in all cases using the survey weights referred to previously. 10 The typical equation
is of the form
𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∗ = Σ𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(1)

where 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∗ is the latent variable for child i at wave t that generates the discrete binary outcome or

ordered discrete outcome, 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 is a vector of the 6 age-gender dummies for the child (3 age groups,
2 genders) and α is its coefficient vector, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of control variables for child i at wave t

and β is its coefficient vector, 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 is a random effect for child i, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the remaining error

term. The vector of control variables consists of measures of household characteristics including
income and household composition (marital status, presence of other children in the household,
etc.), characteristics of the caregiver, measures of participation in relevant welfare programs
(more on this below), and fixed effects for city of residence. The exact list of control variables
and their means is shown in Appendix Tables C-1 to C-3. 11

10

OLS estimates and alternative methods of clustering are discussed below.
The control variables include counts of the number of other children in the household
of each age and gender, so that the coefficients on the age-gender variables for the focal child in
these regressions represent their incremental effects on adult and child food insecurity, holding
fixed the composition of other children in the family. The mean counts of other children in the
family are shown in Appendix Table 3C. The mean number of other children is about 2, so the
mean total number of children in this sample is only 3, not a large number for a low-income
population.
11

13

The main results are shown in Table 2, which shows only the coefficients on the agegender variables. The coefficients on the control variables are shown in Appendix Table C-4 12.
They show that having income below the poverty line and having an unmarried caregiver, for
example, increase the probability of experiencing food insecurity, as does having a disabled
caregiver. 13 Having more adults in the household also increases the probability while having
more other young children in the family decreases it. Being a recipient of SNAP lowers the
probability of having VLFS. This result differs from many estimates of positive effects in the
literature which are usually thought to occur because of selection bias. 14 The negative sign in
this sample suggests that very little if any selection bias is likely present, and this may be, in
turn, because of the homogeneous nature of the TCS sample (all from inner city poor
neighborhoods, all very disadvantaged, etc.).
Turning to the main results, column (1) of Table 2 shows many significant age and
gender differences in overall food insecurity (VLFS) with, for example, an age gradient that was
apparent in the raw means still present after controlling for the variables in the X vector. The age

12

Table C-4 also shows estimates of the effect of child age and gender, uninteracted.
Some prior studies (e.g., Nord, 2013) have found insignificant gender effects on total food
security; we find the same result but only in the uninteracted specification.
13
Additional equations were estimated which decomposed both family income and the
poverty-status dummy into permanent and transitory components, measured, respectively, by the
mean of each variable over the three waves and the family’s deviation from the mean in each
wave. The results (available upon request) show a significant negative effect of permanent
income on food insecurity and significant positive effects of both permanent and transitory
poverty status on food insecurity. However, the coefficients on child age and gender were not
affected, so these results are not shown.
14
See the discussion in Gregory et al. (2016). Our result has also been found in previous
studies using these data (DePolt et al., 2009).
14

gradient is somewhat steeper for those with boys--households with a boy focal child 12-18 have
significantly greater probabilities of VLFS than those with a girl focal child in the same age
range (probit coefficient = -.334). Just the opposite is the case for households with very young
children, where having a boy focal child 0-5 results in a lower probability of having VLFS than
having a girl focal child in the same age range (-.522 vs -.835). 15
The other columns in the upper panel of Table 2 show the coefficient estimates on the
age-gender variables from specifications that have the same control variables but estimated for
the other five outcome measures. The age gradient is maintained for almost all outcomes, with
the exception of girls 6-11 for some of the outcomes. The age gradients for adult food insecurity
are generally smaller than the age gradients for child insecurity. The gender gradients are,
however, considerably smaller for the adult and child insecurity measures than they were for
overall VLFS. The gender gaps at 0-5 and 12-18 are no longer significant, and the gap at 6-11 is
only significant for some outcomes.
The implied magnitudes of the differences translated into probabilities of insecurity (i.e.,
marginal effects) are arguably more relevant and are shown in the bottom portion of the Table. 16
The age gradients are particularly strong for males, with 12-18 males having between 5 and 8

15

Any pairwise difference between two age-gender categories which is statistically
significant at the 10 percent level is indicated in the table. Any such comparison with no
significance level shown is statistically insignificant at that level.
16
The marginal effects are calculated in a way appropriate for the effects of a dummy
variable rather than a continuous variable (see footnotes to the table). We note that the issue of
estimating marginal effects with interactions noted by Ai and Chen (2003) is not directly relevant
here because age-gender variables are the direct object of interest, rather than the overall effect
of either age or gender. We also note that the more recent literature (Pulhani (2012) and the
literature following that paper) recommends, in any case, that interaction coefficients be used
alone when the variables in question are discrete.
15

percentage points higher food insecurity than 0-5 boys. Girls 12-18 also have higher food
insecurity than younger girls, but the magnitude of the gap is generally smaller with 0-5 girls and
generally larger with 6-11 girls than for the same gaps for boys. There is no consistent pattern in
whether these age gradients are larger for adult food insecurity than for the focal child, with the
adult gradient sometimes larger than for the child but often in the other direction as well. The
gender differences are only significant at conventional levels for overall food insecurity and for
VLFS for adults and never significant for child measures, implying that any gender effects are
manifest more in adult food insecurity differences. Where significant, the gender gradients
imply the same reversal from younger ages to older ages, but the magnitudes are largest for the
middle, 6-11 age group. 17
These results will be the basis for the rest of the paper. The next section below lays out a
simple economic model that can be used to interpret these results. Following that, we explore a
number of possible explanations and correlates for these age-gender differences. However,
before doing either of those, we subject our results to several sensitivity and robustness tests
addressing a range of different issues, summarized in Table 3 for the VLFS outcome variable
(results for other outcomes available upon request). First, we address possible concerns with the
inclusion of variables for welfare participation in the equation, especially those for participation

17

We might note at this point that lack of parental knowledge of whether teenagers are
eating if away from home might be contributing to the age gradient results. While this is a
possibility, the questions about child food consumption (see Appendix A) are about cutting
meals, not eating for a full day, or going hungry, which should not, in principle, generate a
positive response if a teenager was simply absent. Also, Nord and Hanson (2012) found that
adolescents often report food problems even if their parents do not, which suggests that the age
gradient might actually be stronger. In addition, adding an ‘Eating at home’ dummy (see below)
to the regression does not affect the age-gender coefficients.
16

in school breakfast and lunch programs which, in addition to being potentially endogenous in
general, could affect child food insecurity. A simple test is just to exclude those variables from
the regression. As the second column shows, this has very little effect on the estimated agegender differences. Another concern is that the strong finding of greater food insecurity among
older children than younger ones could reflect the presence of unobservables correlated with the
presence of older versus younger children in the family. While we cannot test for unobservables
formally, we can examine the sensitivity of the results to the inclusion or exclusion of variables
which markedly change over time as the child ages. These include rising income levels, falling
poverty rates, rising rates of home and car ownership, and aging of other children in the
household (see Appendix Table C-3). The third column of Table 3 shows the effects of
excluding all X variables from the equation which change non-trivially over the waves of the
data. While the coefficient estimates change to some degree, the general pattern and significance
levels do not change. 18
Another concern might be that there are other adults in the household who are providing
assistance to the children’s food consumption. The X vector includes a variable for the number
of adults in the family (including caregiver and any spouse), whose coefficient is significant and
positive (see Appendix Table C-4). This is probably because more mouths to feed means higher
levels of food insecurity, holding income fixed. But the coefficients on the age-gender dummies
could also vary depending on the presence of other adults in the household. The fourth column

18

These results reflect a general lack of correlation between the age-gender variables and
the X variables in the equation in general. OLS regressions of the 6 age-gender dummies on the
X vector yield R2 statistics ranging only from .03 to .11.
17

in Table 3 shows the age-gender coefficients obtained when the sample is restricted to those with
adults present in the household other than caregiver and spouse. 19 Once again, the coefficients
move around in magnitude to some degree (especially that on the 0-5 boys variable, who have
much reduced food insecurity relative to older boys), implying some differences. However, the
general pattern and significance of the results remains. Another test we conduct, shown in the
next column in the table, is to add a dummy variable to the regression for whether the caregiver
is a grandparent. That variable is insignificant but again moves the coefficients slightly around,
with generally reduced differences in the age gaps in food insecurity. 20
The next two columns conduct two sensitivity tests for our sample exclusions. First, we
drop the requirement that the caregiver has to be the same across waves, which results in an
additional 98 observations over all three periods (net of other sample exclusions). The
coefficients again move around slightly but the general pattern remains. We also relax our
requirement that all variables in the X vector be non-missing by dropping the six variables with
the most missing values. This also has little effect on the general pattern.
Finally, we conduct some tests to the estimation method. One test is to estimate the
model with OLS (weighted, random effects) rather than probit. These coefficients, shown in the
final column in the table, should be compared to the marginal effects for VLFS in the lower
panel of Table 2, although the OLS coefficients for some of the effects have to be differenced for

19

About two-thirds of the households have such other adults present, although almost
never more than one.
20
196 observations out of the total of 4,229 had a grandparent caregiver. We might note
at this point that all the caregivers in the analysis sample are female. There were 24 caregivers in
the total original sample who were male, but all 24 were eliminated by the requirement for the
same caregiver over time (which we test for next).
18

comparability. The OLS results are very close to the marginal effects in Table 2. A second
exercise tests the sensitivity of our standard error estimates to methods other than random
effects. One is cluster by child instead of using child random effects (clustering is more robust
than random effects but less efficient if the random effects assumption is correct) and the other is
to cluster both by individual child and by gender of the child. For brevity, the results are shown
in Appendix Table C-5. Clustering instead of using random effects alters the estimated effects
slightly and in one case moves a coefficient slightly below the cutoff for significance at the 10
percent level, while clustering by child and gender leaves most coefficients that were initially
significant still significant except for two coefficients that are moved slightly below that cutoff. 21

3. A Simple Economic Model
A simple economic model can help frame these results and help formalize at least some
of the possible explanations for the differences in food security across members of the
household. One possibility is that adults and children, and children of different ages and
genders, have different nutritional needs, which could lead to different quantities of food being
required to reach a given level of food well-being. 22 This does not automatically imply

21

We also examined the estimates in Table 2 for Bonferroni effects given that two
measures of VLFS (adult and child) and two measures of SUM (also adult and child) are used,
and the two may be correlated. We use the simplest Bonferroni adjustment, which just uses a plevel of α/k, where k is the number of measures, instead of α (this simple adjustment is known to
be conservative in the sense of overadjusting for Type I error). This adjustment does not affect
the conclusions to be drawn in Table 2 because those parameters which are significant in both
adult and child equations have critical values far above the Bonferroni-adjusted ones.
22
Different nutritional needs could also be traced to differences in the activity levels of
adults and children and for different ages and genders of children, which might generate different
nutritional intakes to satisfy.
19

differences across household members if households simply allocate additional food to those
needing more. A second possibility is that adults and children, and children of different ages and
genders, may have different non-food needs. The needs for clothing, housing (bedroom size,
e.g.), and medical care may all differ for adults and different children and, since all compete for
the household dollar, a household may allocate its income differently across different goods for
different household members if non-food needs differ. A third possibility is that food
consumption for children has important future consequences which may be more important than
for adults, and may have consequences for future health, education, and earnings. In addition,
the importance of food intake for future outcomes may differ for children of different ages and
gender, and early child food intake may have implications for health and well-being at later child
ages. A fourth possibility is that a household simply has different preferences for members with
different characteristics. A fifth is that the age and gender composition of the children are related
to household capabilities and functioning, such as financial management, family organization,
and family routines, as will be discussed in more detail below.
There have been a few models in the food insecurity literature which focus on some of
these aspects of household decision making (Barrett, 2002; Gundersen and Gruber, 2001;
Meyerhoefer and Yang, 2011; the last of these draws on Cawley, 2004). However, none of the
frameworks in these studies attempts to model differences between adults and children or
between children of different characteristics. The studies cited in the introduction (Becker and
Tomes, 1976; Behrman et al., 1982; Aizer and Cunha, 2012) are more relevant because they
focus on individual child allocations. But, in all studies, the traditional household production

20

framework is the workhorse model, and that is the same here. 23
Many of the issues can be seen with a model of a household composed of adults and a
single child. Let the household problem be to

where SA is adult food security, SC is food security of the child, NA is adult non-food security
(i.e., security arising from non-food consumption, somehow defined), NC is non-food security of
the child, H is public goods consumption within the household, and YC is a future outcome
(health, education, earnings) of the child. Food security is here assumed to be a continuous
measure of food intake which can generate discrete indicators such as those used in the food
security literature. Non-food security is set up to parallel food security, solely for the purpose of
formality. Both food and non-food security are generated by production functions f and g, with
positive first and negative second derivatives, with inputs of the adults’ and child’s food

23

There has been more past work done on gender differences than age differences. See
Lundberg (2005) for a conceptual analysis of gender differences which also makes the
distinction between preferences and constraints that we make here, and see Raley and Bianchi
(2006) for a sociological study which implicitly discusses the importance of production
functions. See also the references in the Introduction and in the section below on the relationship
between family structure and gender differences in parental inputs.
21

consumption, FA and FC, and non-food consumption, OA and OC, respectively. The functions
depend on XA and XC, the individual characteristics of the adult or child, most prominently age
and gender. Future outcomes for the child are affected by food and non-food security and also
depend on child characteristics, X. Household income, M, is allocated to current food and nonfood consumption to adults and the child, with prices p and q, respectively.
Our interest in this model is in the food allocation to the adults versus the child, which is
governed by the marginal condition
𝑈𝑈1 𝑓𝑓′(𝐹𝐹𝐴𝐴 ; 𝑋𝑋𝐴𝐴 ) = 𝑈𝑈2 𝑓𝑓′(𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶 ; 𝑋𝑋𝐶𝐶 ) + 𝑈𝑈6 ℎ1 (𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶 , 𝑁𝑁𝐶𝐶 ; 𝑋𝑋𝐶𝐶 )𝑓𝑓′(𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶 ; 𝑋𝑋𝐶𝐶 )

(7)

The term on the LHS and the first term on the RHS show that if either the marginal utilities of
increasing food security for the adults and the child differ, or the marginal products of additional
food allocations on food security differ, food allocations will also tend to differ. The second
term on the RHS shows simply that if food security affects future child outcomes, food
allocations will tend to be greater to the child than to the adults even if the production functions
and marginal utilities of the adult and the child are the same. 24 Ignoring these future outcomes
and just examining the other two terms also clearly shows that even if marginal utilities are the
same, more food will be allocated to the child if the marginal product of a given amount of food
in the production of food security is higher for the child, which is plausible because children
have lower food requirements than adults.
However, note that there is no need in this model for the levels of food security to be

24

Adult outcomes such as health and hence wage rates could also be affected by lack of
sufficient food intake. These are examples of investments in health capital, as originally
emphasized by Grossman (1972).
22

equalized between the adults and the child, because it is only the marginal products (weighted by
marginal utilities and ignoring future payoffs) that are equalized. At the optimum, adult food
security could be greater than, equal to, or less than that of the child. On the other hand, it is
plausible (1) that the marginal product of incremental food consumption is higher for the child at
low levels of F, (2) but its marginal product declines more rapidly w.r.t. F than for the adults, and
(3) that the marginal product of F for adults is greater than that of the child at higher levels of F.
In that case, it is plausible that the household first devotes food consumption to the child and
then to the adults thereafter, stopping at a point where resources limit further consumption but at
a level where S is lower for adults. This would be consistent with the child protection
hypothesis.
A model with multiple children speaks more directly to the issues raised by the results
reported in the previous section. Now let the model be:

( 13 )

Once again, greater allocations of food will tend to be made to those children with higher
marginal products in either the production of food security or in future payoffs from increased
food security, ignoring differences in marginal utilities. Both of these are likely to be greater for
younger than older children, and the presence of dynamic complementarities (Cunha and
Heckman, 2007) could generate an additional incentive to allocate more resources to younger
children. Gender differences are not so clear. One possibility is that the rate of return to future
earnings in investing in children is greater for girls because they have a higher likelihood of
going to college relative to food investments in boys for building strength in non-college jobs.
There could also be gender differences in activity levels, and more active children may have
greater nutritional needs, although this would suggest a higher allocation to older children and to
boys. Note that, similarly to the case of adults vs. children discussed above, there is no necessity
for levels of food security to be equalized across children, for only the marginal gains in utility
from incremental food allocations are equalized.
A question to be examined below is whether any differences in food allocations and
resulting food security tend to diminish as income rises. In the model as stated, there is no
reason for those differences to decline because the continuous variable for food security could
increase without bound. However, the empirical work here is based instead on discrete
indicators of low food security. As income rises, it should be expected that food allocations rise
and that means that food security does as well and, after a point, all individuals in the family are
likely to have passed whatever threshold is determining the discrete indicators. Therefore it
should be expected that these between-child differences in the food security indicators will
24

decline and will decline for all household members as income rises. However, there is still an
important empirical question of exactly how high income has to rise before the differences in the
indicators start to narrow.
The model implies that the optimal food and non-food allocations to different children
should be a function of income, the relative prices of food and non-food individualized
consumption goods, and the parameters of the production and utility functions. The data set
available here has no information on most of these variables, including the core choice variables
which are the food and non-food allocations. Consequently, only reduced form equations for the
main outcome variables in the data--the food security levels of the focal child and of the adults-can be estimated. These equations have to be interpreted as reduced forms of the production
functions for S, obtained by solving for the optimal allocations of F and O and substituting those
into the equation.
However, several important aspects of possible correlates of age and gender gaps
between children will be examined below. First, data are available on the nutritional needs of
children of different ages and genders, and these can be used to explore the degree to which they
can explain the gaps (these variables should be thought of as being included in the X vector).
Second, data are available on household structure, which can be used to explore whether the gaps
are related to the marital status of the mother. The data set here also has a measure of whether
the household is well organized in a sense to be defined below. Third, data are available on
household income, of course, but also on other aspects of resource availability, including
resources from the household’s network. These can be used to explore whether the age and
gender gaps shrink as resources rise, as predicted by the model. Also available in the data is a
25

variable for whether the household has difficulty meeting its desired expenditure (“financial
strain”), which is both a measure of financial management skills of the parents as well as
hardships that result from short-term shocks to resources (e.g., Bray 2001 detected these separate
dimensions in an analysis of responses to financial stress questions in Australia). With respect to
financial management, a qualitative study by Edin et al. (2013) found that low-income parents
invest enormous amounts of time in deciding where to shop for food, finding where the best
prices are, looking for sales, planning meals around inexpensive foods, and managing their
budget in general, and that some parents are more skilled at that activity than others.
Mullainathan and Shafir (2014) have emphasized the cognitive challenges that low-income
individuals face in making rational decisions. A quantitative analysis by Gundersen and Garasky
(2012) had a measure of financial management skills and found that such skills reduce the
incidence of food insecurity. With respect to the hardship element, Joyce et al. (2012)
documented that children’s food problems and hunger rarely happen in isolation but rather often
co-occur with a constellation of other financial and non-financial hardships. The financial strain
variable used below may capture both the management and hardship dimensions.

4. Investigation of Correlates
4.1. Nutritional Needs
Two measures of nutritional needs by the age and gender of children are available, one
developed by the USDA used to set SNAP benefit levels and one from the Institute of Medicine.
Regarding the first of these, the USDA has for many years estimated the cost of purchasing a
minimally adequate diet for individuals of different ages and genders. The methodology uses
26

dietary guidelines established for different ages and genders and determines the market basket of
different food groups needed to meet the Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) for 15
essential nutrients (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1999). Specific low-cost options for
weekly meals which attain these RDAs are then calculated by obtaining prices for different foods
which together will yield this outcome. The minimal cost of that bundle of meals is called the
Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) and is widely used to assess the adequacy of family incomes to achieve
minimally nutritious diets as well as being used by USDA to set SNAP allotments. 25
Appendix Table C-6 shows the 1999 USDA TFP weekly food costs for individuals of
different ages and genders in a family of four. Food costs for children less than 12 do not differ
by gender but rise significantly with age. Gender differences in food costs appear for older
children and adults but those are also modest in size, but some of the age differences (e.g.,
between adolescents and those under 12) are larger. Given these differences, a family with
limited financial resources may choose to forgo expenditures for adolescents with their high food
costs in favor of protecting younger children and maintaining their food input at nutritionally
adequate levels. Or, in the language of the model, the marginal product of a given amount of
food expenditure may be greater for those with lower nutritional needs.
We follow a three-step method to determine how much of the age-gender gaps can be
explained by nutritional needs. The first step is to use Appendix Table C-6 to assign a TFP value

25

Caswell and Yaktine (2013) and Ziliak (2016) critique the TFP measure by noting that
it assumes that families purchase the lowest-cost foods and devote large amounts of time in food
preparation. This implies that the TFP may underrepresent the cost for the average family which
cannot devote that degree of time and must purchase higher-price food items.
27

to each focal child in the sample, using that focal child’s age and gender. 26 We then reestimate
the food insecurity equations in Table 2 but substitute the TFP variable for the focal child for the
five age-gender indicators in that equation.

The third step is to use these estimated equations to

predict what the age-gender food security gaps would be, based solely on TFP differences. By
comparing the predicted gaps to the actual ones, we can assess how much of the observed, actual
gap can be explained by differential nutritional needs.
The estimates of the coefficients on the focal child TFP variable are positive and strongly
significant for all six measures of food insecurity, with t-statistics ranging from 3 to 5 (not
shown). But the main question is how much they explain the differences in marginal effects
shown in the lower panel of Table 2. The predicted differences from the TFP estimates are given
in Table 4, which should be compared to those in Table 2. For boys, differences in TFP explain
a major part of the age gaps, ranging from a low of about one-fourth of the actual gap to all of it
(or, in a couple of cases, more than all of it). Most of the values are in the one-half to two-thirds
range for both the binary and SUM measures, and usually a larger fraction is explained for girls
than for boys.

But TFP nutritional needs explain almost none of the gender gaps that were

significant in Table 2, which is not surprising given that the TFP does not have a gender
component below age 15 and only a modest component at ages 15-18.
A second measure of nutritional needs is produced by the Institute of Medicine as part of
its series of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), which have replaced the old RDAs, and are

26

As noted in the footnote to Appendix Table C-6, those figures differ by family size, so
this must be taken into account in the assignment.
28

calculated as estimated average requirements for over 20 nutrients by age and gender. 27 While
most DRIs vary with age in the expected way, no gender differences for children 8 and below are
estimated and those for children over 8 are usually small. For the purpose of this exercise, the
three nutrients with the strongest gender differences above age 8—Vitamin A, Zinc, and
Magnesium—were purposely selected to obtain an upper bound on how much these nutrient
indices can explain the gender gap. For all three, boys were estimated to have higher
requirements than girls. The three-step procedure used to estimate the influence of TFP values
was then duplicated—first determining the value of each nutrient for each focal child, then
reestimating the food insecurity equation by replacing the age-gender dummies with the three
nutrient values for the focal child, then predicting the age-gender gaps implied by those nutrient
values alone. Appendix Table C-7 shows the predicted age and gender gaps from these nutrient
values alone, which should again be compared to the bottom panel of Table 2. For the age gaps,
these nutrient values generally explain even more of the gaps for boys than the TFP values did,
but the opposite is generally true for girls, where these nutrients, more often than not, explain
less than the TFP values (with some exceptions). For gender gaps, while these nutrients explain
little of the gaps for younger girls, they explain much more of the gaps for teenage boys and girls
and, again, in some cases, explaining all or more than all of it. While the nutrients selected were
intentionally those which had large gender gaps for teenagers, this does suggest that nutrient
requirements have the potential to explain much of the gap for that age group.
These results imply that differences in nutritional needs “explain” a large fraction of the

27

http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Activities/Nutrition/SummaryDRIs/DRITables.aspx.
29

age differences in food insecurity across children. As noted previously, the needs differences
explain the food insecurity differences only in the sense that they imply that parents do not
allocate food expenditures across children to equalize levels of food insecurity, which does not
imply that they do not allocate more expenditure per se to children with higher needs—just not
enough to reduce their food insecurity levels to those of children with lower needs. These
findings are consistent with the production function model outlined in the previous section.
4.2. Family Structure and Organization
The influence of family structure on child outcomes has been discussed in the literature. 28
While all households in this sample are poor and have children, both married and unmarried
mothers are included, and unmarried mothers in this case are equivalent to single mothers. 29
While the marital status variable was a statistically insignificant determinant of the level of food
insecurity in Appendix Table C-4, this is an average effect over married and unmarried mother
families and does not imply that the effects of age-gender composition might not vary by marital
status.
Single parenthood could have many different channels of effects on food allocations to

28

E.g., Bertrand and Pan (2013) found that gender differences in outcomes (not inputs
per se) among adolescents were affected by family structure, consistent with Table 5 below. The
relationship between family structure and age gaps among children has been much less examined
in the literature than the relationship with gender gaps. In the latter category, in addition to
Bertrand and Pan, see Lundberg and Rose (2003), Dahl and Moretti (2008), Blau et al. (2017),
and Kabátek and Ribar (2017). Bertrand and Pan (2013), the most relevant to our study, found
that single mothers are less favorable toward boys than married mothers, which is a direction of
effect similar to ours.
29

The data have a measure of cohabitation as well, but it was tested and found to have
the same effect as being unmarried.
30

different children (holding mother’s employment and household income fixed). Low-income
male spouses may, on average, have different preferences over food allocations than wives, for
example, either by gender or by age of the child (e.g., men may have stronger preferences for
supporting teenage boys). Having a male spouse to help with household production in other
aspects may free up time for the mother to devote to food preparation and to ensure that all
children are obtaining needed food consumption. Indeed, having a husband present may allow
the mother to spend more time simply monitoring the food consumption of their children. Wives
may have superior knowledge of the food security production functions than husbands, and
possibly better knowledge of the future payoffs to children of different ages from increased food
allocations. The net effect of these and related considerations on age and gender differences in
food security are not clear and should be an empirical matter to resolve.
Table 5 shows the results of estimating random effects probit equations for the overall
binary indicator of food insecurity, VLFS, and that for adults and children, VLFSA and VLFSC,
respectively, separately for households with married and unmarried mothers. Only binary
indicators are examined here, for brevity (results using the SUM measures add very little).
Estimates for VLFSC for children with married mothers are not possible because no observations
have positive VLFSC, which is partly a result of small sample size but also an indicator, in and
of itself, of a difference between the two types of mothers. As the table shows, there is a marked
difference in the age and gender patterns of food insecurity for children in households with
unmarried and married mothers, especially for the age patterns. For both boys and girls, large
and statistically significant differences between younger children and older children in families
where the mother is unmarried essentially disappear completely in significance for children in
31

families where the mother is married. 30 For gender, there is an anomalous result for younger
children, where a significant gender gap appears only for married mothers, but for older children,
the occasional significant gender difference for unmarried mothers is not present for married
mothers. Overall, these results suggest that household structure does have an impact.
The data also have a measure of household organization which is rarely available in other
data sets, with questions aimed at ascertaining whether the family had established routines-whether they had a time when everyone talks or plays quietly, whether the children go to bed at
the same time every night, whether they all eat dinner together every evening, and whether at
least some of them eat breakfast together (see Appendix Table C-3). Developmental
psychologists have found that having such family routines is correlated with positive
developmental outcomes for children. In our case, the last two questions are also directly related
to whether the children are eating with the rest of the household, which could be related to
monitoring of food intake by the adults.
We construct a variable defined as whether the sum of the responses to the four equations
is below or above the median sum in the full sample, and define this as having Low or High
Family Routines. Entering this variable linearly into the food insecurity questions reported
previously shows that having household routines above the median has a strongly significant
negative effect on food insecurity. Table 6 shows the results when the binary indicator probits
for food insecurity are estimated separately for those with Low and High values of the routine

30

The VLFSC estimates for children with unmarried mothers are almost identical to
those in Table 3 but this is simply because children with married mothers are not contributing to
the coefficients.

index. The results show that there are many cases where age or gender differences are
significant and large for those with low values of household routines which are much reduced in
magnitude and sometimes in significance for those with high household routine values. This is
especially the case for boys, where the age differences for children in families with high routine
values are a half or less as large as those in families with low values. For girls, effects are
insignificant for overall food insecurity (VLFS) (although larger in magnitude for families with
low family routine values) and there is one unexpected result for young girls for adult food
insecurity, but for child food insecurity the significant effects for low-routine-value households
are rendered insignificant for households with high values. Gender differences are not
significant much of the time in general, but in two cases a significant gender difference among
young girls and boys which is significant in households with low routines values disappears for
households with high values. In one case, for older boys and girls, an effect (VLFS) is moved
slightly over the borderline of 10 percent significance for high routine value households, but the
magnitude is essentially the same.
Thus, while there are occasional exceptions for some gender and age groups, the general
tendency of the results suggests strongly that household structure and household organization
and joint eating patterns affect the magnitude and presence of age and gender differences in food
security between different children in the household. The effects are strongest in unmarried
households and in those with low levels of household organization and who tend not to eat
together.
4.3. Income, Financial Strain, and Networks
As noted in the theoretical discussion and as is intuitively obvious, the fraction of
33

household members experiencing food intake deficiencies below a fixed threshold should decline
as income rises. In addition, while there is no necessary relationship between age-gender
differences and income as income rises but food deficiencies are still below the threshold, it
should not be surprising if all differences narrow as they all approach zero. But what the rate of
decline is as income rises, and at exactly what point the differences begin to narrow or disappear,
is an empirical question. The data being employed here were drawn from a sample of
households with income less than or equal to 200 percent of the poverty line, which means that it
is still, by any definition, a low-income sample. Whether within-household food security
differences narrow as income rises up to the 200 percent of poverty level is not obvious.
A measure of total household cash income has been included in all estimated equations
thus far, as is traditional in the literature on food insecurity, in addition to a dichotomous
measure of whether that income is below the poverty line. The coefficients on income are
usually statistically insignificant but those on the poverty status variable are always strongly
significantly positive for all food security outcomes—overall, adult, and child (see Appendix
Table C-4 for the first of these)--indicating a positive association between food insecurity of the
household and having income below the poverty line. Here, the approach to examining whether
the age-gender differences fall as income rises is simply to estimate the equations separately for
households with income below the poverty line (about $20,000 for a family of three in 2017) and
those above it, to determine if those differences change with income category.
Two other measures of household income resources are also available in these data. One
is a measure of what is termed “financial strain,” which is constructed from a set of six questions
asking the caregiver how often her household had to borrow to pay bills, had to put off buying
34

something it needed, could not afford to do things “for fun”, had difficulty paying bills, could not
afford the housing, food, and clothing they needed, or generally ended up with not enough
money (see footnotes to Appendix Table C-3). 31

These questions were aimed at determining

more accurately the household’s financial situation than just their income, but could be
interpreted as reflecting either financial management or hardships resulting from negative shocks
(see above for evidence on such shocks). A household that is an ideal rational economic agent
which is experiencing a fixed level of income at all times should not be expected to have to
borrow, to put off buying items, to pay bills unless it has unusual intertemporal preferences, for
all these activities just push off consumption challenges to the future. Of course, low income
households may not fit that ideal type and may exhibit behavioral responses, cognitive
challenges, or simply poor financial management skills that prevent them from fixing
consumption at a permanent level to match their income (see literature references above). But
the situation is likely to be worse for a household experiencing transitory shocks, either to
income or to consumption needs (sick child, need to buy school supplies in September, and a
host of others), and this may cause short-term problems of the type described by these financial
strain questions. The approach taken here will be similar to that for poverty status, by simply
estimating separating equations for those who are experiencing high levels of financial strain and
those who are not, to determine if within-household food allocations differ by the two types of
households; no attempt will be made to distinguish between these two explanations for any

31

The one question that asked about not having enough food could reflect food insecurity
rather than the other way around. However, it does not have any necessarily relationship to the
relative values of food insecurity across children of different ages and genders, which is the
focus here.
35

differentials.
Finally, the data also have responses to a set of four questions asked about the
household’s access to a supportive social network, regarding whether the household caregiver
had access to people who will listen, help with child care, help with small favors, or loan money
(again see footnotes to Appendix Table C-3). Having a strong network implies that monetary or
in-kind resources are available in case of negative shocks and hence has an insurance value to a
household. 32 While 70 percent of the sample reported positively to at least one of the four
questions, 30 percent responded negatively to all four. Not answering any of the four positive
implies a very limited social network and a high degree of financial vulnerability to income or
consumption shocks. As with the poverty status and financial strain variables, the approach here
is simply to estimate the equations separately for households with lower and higher levels of
network support to determine if age and gender differences in food insecurity differ for the two
types of households.
Tables 7A, 7B, and 7C show the results of the estimation for the three different measures
of resources, again only for the binary indicators of food insecurity for brevity. Table 7A shows
major differences in age-gender differentials in almost all measures of food insecurity between
households with income below and above the poverty line. For example, while age differences
for boys are strong and significant in households with below-poverty level income, they

32

Martin et al. (2004), in a small sample of families in Connecticut, found that an index
of social capital--which includes trust, reciprocity, and social networks--was positively
associated with household food security, and that neighbor reciprocity was particularly strongly
so associated. Edin et al. (2013) found that the availability of kin networks was extremely
important in combating food crises by invitations from those kin to eat at their house, but that
many families have no networks at all and have a much more difficult time in coping.
36

disappear in significance or are greatly weakened in households with higher incomes. Several
gender differences in households with below-poverty incomes are statistically and economically
significant, and all of those disappear completely for households with incomes above the poverty
line. Only the age differences for girls do not follow this pattern, where differentials are
sometimes stronger in households with higher incomes for food insecurity measured in the
household overall or among adults, although the pattern for child food insecurity again shows
significant effects for lower income households and insignificant ones for higher income
households. The general tendency, even if not present for every age-gender comparison, is for
differentials to fall if income simply rises above the poverty line, usually to statistical
insignificance.
The results for the impact of financial strain shown in Table 7B are similar but not quite
as systematic across all comparisons. Again the most marked changes are for boys, where age
differences fall in magnitude and/or significance when financial strain falls. 33 However, for girls
the age differences move more uniformly to smaller magnitudes and insignificance, unlike the
pattern of poverty status just discussed. A more mixed pattern appears for gender differences,
where magnitudes and significance levels are sometimes higher and sometimes lower in
households with lower levels of financial strain. To the extent that this variable is measuring the
response to transitory shocks in income or consumption, it could be that they result in changes in
food allocations that are different than changes in response to changes in permanent income or

For the differential between boys 0-5 and 12-18 in VLFSA, the differential falls in
magnitude when strain falls but so does the standard error, moving the p-value just under 10
percent.
37

resources.
Finally, the effects are considerably weaker for the impact of networks, as shown in
Table 7C. While age differences in VLFSA for boys, age differences in VLFS and VLFSC for
girls, and some gender differences are lower in households with stronger networks, there is no
difference in differentials for boys in VLFS, and gender differences are sometimes greater and
sometimes smaller in households with networks of different strength. It may be that the network
questions underlying the index mix different kinds of effects, with some of them (e.g., having
someone else take care of a child) possibly increasing differentials rather than decreasing them.
It may also be that strong social networks create sets of reciprocal obligations on households that
impose demands, while also providing resources.
The three measures of household resources examined in this section do not uniformly and
consistently support the hypothesis that food insecurity differentials fall as resources rise for all
age-gender categories, but the strong effects for cash income—which arguably is the most likely
to have the expected effect--as well as the somewhat weaker effects for financial strain and
network strength, show a clear general tendency in that direction.

5. Summary and Conclusions
In summary, using a unique data set measuring food deprivation for children of different
ages and gender in the U.S. from 1999 to 2005, significant differences in levels of food
insecurity across children of different ages and genders are detected. Food insecurity levels are
much higher among older children than among younger ones and are sometimes higher among
older boys than among older girls. Allocations are strongly correlated with the dietary needs of
38

the child as well as with household structure and the level of family organization. Further, the
cross-child differences appear only in the poorest households with the lowest levels of money
income and household resources in general, and most differences disappear in significance or are
greatly reduced in magnitude when resources rise to only modest levels.
The results here should by far not be the last word on the subject, but should instead lead
to further work to examine these issues with more data sets and samples in the U.S. and in
Europe. More direct data on food consumption from consumption data sets would be quite
valuable. Another missing element in this paper is the relationship between the quantity and
quality of food consumed, and whether low income families save money by choosing
unnutritious, unhealthy food (Bhattacharya and Currie, 2001; Bhattacharya et al., 2004). Studies
examining these issues in Europe would be valuable given its generally much lower levels of
income inequality and stronger safety net programs, and consequent lower levels of food
hardship. Updating the results to more recent years of the U.S. would also be of interest since
the relative size of the population with extremely low incomes has grown both because of further
deterioration in the labor market of unskilled workers, and because of a long-run decline in the
degree of welfare program support going to the lower income households (Moffitt, 2015). These
and other issues should provide a fruitful agenda for research going forward.

Marginal effects calculated by setting all Control variables to their means, all age-gender variables to zero, and calculating
baseline probabilities from predicted values of Prob(VLFS=1), Prob(VLFSA=1), Prob(VLFSC=1), Prob(SUM>1), Prob(SUMA>0), and
Prob(SUMC>0). Then, for each age-gender group, the six predicted probabilities are recalculated using the estimated coefficient
for that group, and the difference from the baseline probability is the marginal effect. Standard errors are derived by
bootstrapping.

Appendix B
Analysis of the 1999 Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement

Because the TCS data only have 8 of the 18 USDA questions, we construct a VLFS
variable which is correlated with the USDA definition of VLFS to the maximum extent. To
make this determination, we obtained the data from the April 1999 Census survey--which is
closest in calendar time to the first wave of the TCS survey--and selected those households with
children, living in a metropolitan area, and with household income below 185 percent of the
poverty line (a variable that was available in the Census survey) to approximate the TCS sample.
For each of the resulting 1,113 households in the Census data, we constructed both a USDA
VLFS indicator variable equal to 1 if 8 or more of the 18 questions were answered affirmatively,
but also a set of VLFS indicator variables using only the 8 Census questions that were used in the
TCS survey. Specifically, using only those 8 in the Census data, we constructed VLFS
indicators for whether 1 or more, 2 or more, or 3 or more of the 8 TCS questions were answered
affirmatively, and we then determined which of these indicators classified families most closely
into the same VLFS categories as they were placed into using the full 18 questions. 34
Our results showed that the “error rate” was smallest for a definition using the subset of
TCS questions which classified a household as having VLFS if 2 or more of the 8 questions were
answered affirmatively. For that definition, 81 percent of those classified as having VLFS also
had VLFS by the 8-or-more-out-of-18-question USDA definition. Further, using this same 2-or-

34

Of course, the Census questions for children ask about all children whereas the TCS
questions only ask about the focal child, so there is a necessary noncomparability in that sense.
56

more-out-of-8 VLFS definition, 97 percent of those classified as not having VLFS were also not
VLFS by the full USDA criterion. The overall misclassification rate, or error rate, was only 4
percent. In contrast, defining VLFS as having answered 1 or more of the 8 questions
affirmatively resulted in a 7 percent misclassification rate (and only 57 percent of those classified
as having VLFS from this definition were also classified as having VLFS by the USDA
definition) and, going higher by requiring a household to answer 3 or more of the 8 questions
affirmatively to be classified as VLFS resulted in a 6 percent misclassification rate. Other
definitions resulted in even larger misclassification percents.
Applying this definition--namely, VLFS=1 if 2 or more of the 8 questions are answered
affirmatively--to the TCS data themselves yields a VLFS rate of 8.8 percent. The Census
sample we used for the analysis above has a VLFS rate of 9.4 percent, quite close. 35
In a separate analysis, Moffitt and Ribar (2016) validated these count and binary
measures from the TCS using the same formal (item-response theory, IRT) methods as Bickel et
al. (2000). The formal analyses showed that the TCS responses follow a single-parameter
“Rasch” IRT model and that a count of the affirmed responses is a sufficient statistic for food
security.

35

In a separate analysis, we estimated logit models on the CPS data first using the
USDA definition of VLFS as the dependent variable and then using the 2-or-more-out-of-8
definition. The signs and magnitudes of the coefficients on covariates for family structure, race,
income, regional location, education, ages of children, and other socioeconomic characteristics
were not very different.

*Significant at the 10% level
Marginal effects calculated by setting all Control variables to their means, all age-gender variables to zero, and calculating
baseline probabilities from predicted values of Prob(VLFS=1). Then, for each age-gender group, the predicted probability is
recalculated using the estimated coefficient for that group, and the difference from the baseline probability is the marginal
effect. Standard errors are derived by bootstrapping.
