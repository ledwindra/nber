SELF—EMPLOYMENT AND LABOR FORCE

PARTICIPATION OF OLDER MALES

Abs tract

This longitudinal analysis of the labor market behavior of older,

urban white males in 1969, 1971, and 1973 focuses on changes from wage—
and—salary to self—employment and changes from working to non—working

status. In each two—year transition approximately four percent of wage—
and—salary workers switched to self—employment. They were primarily men
who were previously self—employed or who were in wage—and—salary
occupations with characteristics similar to self—employment, e.g.,

managers and salesmen. For a blue collar worker employed forty hours
per week the predicted probability of switching was close to zero.

Controlling for a large number of economic and demographic variables, the
self—employed were significantly more likely to continue to work, partly
by reducing their workweek to under 35 hours. Other significant predi.ctors
of continuing to work are good health, years of schooling, white collar

occupation, no expectation of a private pension, and a workweek longer than

fifty hours. Age is also important, especially at the eligibility ages
set by social security.

SELF-EMPLOYMENT AND LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION OF OLDER MALES

Victor R. Fuchs

Introduction

Background

The labor market behavior of older workers 1is receiving increasing

attention from social scientists at the same time that policies affecting

such behavior are becoming important subjects of public debate. Empirical
economic research has concentrated primarily on explaining labor supply——
especially the retirement decision——with ill health, social security payments,
private pensions, assets, income, wage rates, taxes, and the business

cycle the main variables of analysis. Some economic research, primarily
theoretical, has attempted to explain other phenomena such as seniority
rules, rigidity of wages at older ages, and mandatory retirement.
Recent policy discussions have focused on the desirability of raising or

eliminating mandatory retirement ages, raising the social security
retirement age, and reducing or eliminating the implicit tax on earnings
of those eligible for social security retirement benefits.
The principal reason for the increase in interest in older
workers is the realization that current retirement patterns, longer life
expectancy, and a slowing—down in the growth of the non—aged labor force
will eventually necessitate either large increases in taxes or large

decreases in benefits to retired workers. Short of large—scale immigration
there is not much that can be done to change the size of the non—aged
labor force for at least the next 20 years, and no one is advocating

2

shorter life expectancy. Thus, there is growing support for efforts to
róverse the trend toward earlier retirement.

According to Gordon and Blinder (1980) there are five basic classes

of' reasons why older people retire from the labor force. They are: poor
health, age—related declines in wages for reasons other than health,
incentives created by the social security retirement system, incentives
created by private pensions, and age—related shifts in preferences toward

leisure. In a recent study, based on cross—section analysis of Retirement History Study data, they find strong effects from wages and private
pensions, a usubstantial, though not overwhelming!! effect of ill health,

some support for a shift in preferences, but an insignificant effect from

social security. Boskin (1977), on the other hand, has questioned the
significance of health and has emphasized the importance of social security
retirement benefits, as have Pellechio (1979) and several other investigators.

Most of the published studies have concentrated on wage—and—

salary workers alone; the self—employed are typically excluded. An
important exception is Quinn (1980a, b), who has looked specifically at
the self—employed, and who has called attention to I!partial retirement.!!

He has speculated that some wage—and—salary workers switch to self—employment toward the end of the life cycle as an' alternative to withdrawal from

the labor force. He assumes that there is much more flexibility in hours
and wages among the self—employed and that the change in class of work is
a form of partial retirement.

The increased importance of self—employment at older ages is a

well established feature of the U.S. labor market. For instance, in

3

cross—sectional data the proportion self—employed among white urban male
workers rises from about 15 percent in the late fifties to more than 25

percent by the late sixties. (See Table 1, column 1.) Given a long—term
trend away from self—employment,--'1 this increase may be partly a cohort

effect. However, in longitudinal data from the Retirement History Study
(columns 2 through 7 of Table 1), life—cycle effects within cohorts are

also very pronounced. Indeed, for every birth cohort except 1907, the
within cohort change is slightly larger than that revealed in the cross—section,

possibly for cyclical reasons or as an artifact of the RHS sample.
The observed increase in the importance of self—employment over
the life cycle can result from class—of—worker differences in continuation
at work or from shifts by wage—and—salary workers into self—employment,

or both. Table 2 shows that both phenomena were present during the period
under study. In the 1969—71 and 1971—73 transitions approximately four
to five percent of wage—and—salary workers switched to self—employment;

within this eight—year segment of the life—cycle the probability of switching
does not vary systematicallywith age. A class—of—worker differential in the
probability of continuing to work is also readily apparent. This probability was
higher for the self-employed than for wage and salary workers at every age in both

transitions. The differential in the probability does vary with age, rising from a
very small difference at 58 and 59 to a very large one in the middle sixties.

This paper focuses on both the switch to self—employment and the
class—of—worker differential in the probability of continuing to work.

First, the increase in the relative importance of self—employment at each

age is decomposed into its two sources. Second, the results of multiple

regressions of the probability of switching are presented. The principal

empirical section of the paper provides new estimates of the impact of
class of worker, ill health, wages, social security, private pensions,
mandatory retirement, and other variables on the labor force participation

of older males. The analysis is longitudinal and focuses on the probability
of being at work at t+2 and t+4 years conditional on working at year t.
The final set of regressions tests the hypothesis

that

the higher propensity

of the self—employed to continue to work at older ages is related to their
ability to reduce their work week to less than 35 hours.

The Data

The data used in this paper come from the Retirement History

Study, which egan in 1969 when thesubjects were ages 58 through 63.
Responses to interviews conducted in 1971 and 1973, as well as 1969, are

included. I have restricted the analysis to white urban males in order
to eliminate complications introduced by sex and race differences in
behavior, and to avoid definitional problems concerning the labor force

participation of older farmers. Class of worker was determined by the
response to the question "Are you (a) an employee of a private company,
(b) a government employee, (c) self—employed, (d) working without pay?"
Those who responded (a) or (b) were classified as "wage—and—salary."
The very small number who responded (d) were treated as not working.
In 1969 there were approximately 3500 white urban males in the
sample who were at work and who were retained in the sample in l97l.'
Approximately 2500 were working in 1971 and retained in the sample in 1973.
During each transition approximately 12 percent of the men who were working

7

at time t were lost from the sample by t+2. Individuals were lost from
the sample through death, institutionalization, refusal to respond to

subsequent interviews, or unreported change in location. In general, men
lost from the sample did not have significantly different characteristics

from those retained. For men working at time t, the only statistically
significant predictor of being lost from the sample at t+2 is the presence
of a health—related work limitation.-" The analysis is restricted to men
who were working in the initial year of each transition in order to focus
on subsequent changes in status with a full set of observations for all
variables.

Sources of Increase in Self—employment
One of the advantages of the longitudinal data is the opportunity
they afford for decomposing the life—cycle increase in the relative
importance of self—employment into the share attributable to a class of
worker differential in continuing to work, and the share attributable to
a net shift into self—employment.

This decomposition, shown in Table 3, reveals that the source of

the increase in self—employment varies considerably with age. For those
men who were 58 or 59 in 1969, all of the increase is attributable

to switching from wage and salary to self—employed status. At age 60
(cohorts 1909 in 1969, and 1911 in 1971), shifts in class of worker and

differential continuity of work are about equal in importance. Above age
60 differential work patterns become more important than shifting,

accounting for at least 60 percent and sometimes all of the increase in

the relative importance of self—employment. For the sample as a whole,
it appears that both switching and differential continuity are important.

The balance of the paper, therefore, is devoted to the questions: "Who
switches?" and "Who continues to work?"

Regression Analysis
Model and Variables

In order to explore systematically whether those older men who
continue working differ in predictable ways from those who stop, and

whether those wage and salary workers who switch to self—employment late
in life are different from those who do not, a series of maximum likelihood
logit regressions were run based on the transitions from 1969 to 1971 and

from 1971 to 1973 (and sometimes 1969 to 1973). Because results for each
transition were similar, only the pooled results are reported in the paper.

The independent variables used in the regressions are defined in Table 4

and mean values are shown in Table 5. YRSPRSE, which measures previous
experience in self—employment, was obtained from social security records

that were matched to each individual. A second group of variables describes
the job at time t.

There

are four weekly hours dummies, four hourly wage

dummies, and four dummy variables for occupation. Personal characteristics
are covered by three health status dummies, a continuous variable measuring

years of schooling, and a separate dummy variable for each single year of

age. There are four dummy variables describing private pension expectations
and mandatory retirement status, and three dummy variables for expected

Who

Switches

to Self—employment?

Table 6 reports the results of a regression designed to answer the

question "Who switches to self—employment?" The sample is restricted to
the men who were working as wage—and—salary workers in the initial year
(1969 or 1971) and who were also working in the terminal year (1971 or 1973)

1973).!' The dependent variable is dichotomous, taking a value of 1 if
the subject switched to self—employment, and 0 if he continued as a

wage—and—salary worker. The marginal effect of each independent variable,
evaluated at mean probability, is shown after the regression coefficient
and its standard error.

We see that previous experience with self—employment, occupation,
and weekly hours at current job are all significant predictors of the
probability of a wage—and—salary worker switching to self—employment.
Also, wage—and—salary workers who are subject to mandatory retirement
beyond t+2 or who expect a private pension are less likely to switch.
On the other hand, expectations about the amount of social security income,
health status, education, age, and wages are not significantly related to

changes from wage and salary to self—employment status. A dummy variable
that compares the probability of switching in 1971—73 vs. 1969—71 is also
insignificant.

It is quite clear that the men who switched to self—employment
are primarily those who have had previous e::perience in self—employment

or who are in wage—and—salary jobs that are similar in many respects to

self—employment. Managers, professionals, and salesmen, for instance,
frequently have a good deal of discretion as to how they spend their

time, and their compensation is frequently closely tied to their perform-

ance. Also, the very short (< 35) or very long ( 50) work weeks reported
by the switchers while they were in wage—and—salary employment are
characteristic of the self—employed. The contrasts among wage—and—salary
workers in the probability of switching is quite striking. Although the mean

probability of changing to self—employment is .04, the predicted probability for a blue collar worker with a 40—hour per week job, eligible for
a pension, and no previous self—employment experience, is only

.003.

On the other hand, the predicted probability for a manager with some
self—employment income in any ten years since 1951, an unusually short

Who Continues to Work?
The regression results presented in Table 7 provide some intriguing

answers to the question "Who continues to workY' This formulation is used
rather than "Who retires?" for two reasons. First, it is possible to
determine with considerable accuracy whether a man is working or not at

a given time, whereas the concept of "retirement" is ambiguous. For
instance, in these data some men who state that they are "retired" are

also working. Second, other investigators are using these data to study
"retirement"; the results reported here provide some insight into the
importance of the particular formation of the question.

The analysis is restricted to men working in the initial year who

were sampled in the terminal year. The dependent variable is dichotomous,
taking a value of 1 if the man was also working in the terminal year,

and 0 if he was not. The independent variables are the same as in the
switching regression, except that a dummy variable for self—employment

is substituted for PRVSE. The results are discussed by groups of variables.

Class of worker and age. The regression results presented in
Table 7 confirm the inferences drawn from Tables 2 and 3 that the self—
employed are more likely to continue working than are wage—and—salary
workers. Evaluated at mean probability, and controlling for other variables,

the class of worker differential is almost 8 percentage points. In
regressions based on the transition from 1969 to 1973 (not shown here)
it is possible to compare the probability of continuing to work of men
who had been self—employed in 1969 with that of men who switched to

self—employment in 1971. The coefficients are the same to two decimal
places and the coefficients for the other variables are very sinUlar to
those shown in Table 7.

This table also shows that age is significant, but there are

substantial discontinuities in the effect of age, probably because

of the structure of the social security law.

If withdrawal from

work were determined primarily by biological aging rather, than institu-

tionally imposed incentives and constraints, the age coefficients in

Table 7 would tend to change at a smooth rate. They do not. Instead,
we observe a significantly larger decrease for those men who reach 65

during the transition period (i.e., those who are age 63 or 64 at t), the
"normal" age for retirement under social security and many private pension

18

plans. We also observe a discontinuity for men reaching 62 (age 60 at t),
the eligibility age for 'tearly" retirement under social security. This
can be seen by the large positive coefficient for age 59, indicating that
the change from 59 to 60 is almost twice as large as the change from 58

to 59. There are also some significant interactions between class of
worker and age which will be discussed after the principal results for
the other variables are presented.

Health status, pensions, mandatory retirement, and social security.
Health status is a remarkably strong predictor of the probability of

working. This result has been found before in several cross—section
studies, but its validity has been questioned because of the possibility

that respondents offer poor health" as a rationalization for not working.
The findings in this study are less subject to that criticism because
all the men are working when their self—evaluation of health status is

ascertained. Even in the 1969—73 regression (not shown), when health
status at time t is used to predict work status four years later (and the
sample is restricted to men at work in 1969 and 1971 and still in the

sample in 1973), the health variables do very

well.

Men who report no

health—related work limitation, but are only in average or worse—than—
average health, show a marginal effect of .088 (compared to those with a work
limitation and average or worse—than—average health), while men with no

work limitation and above—average health show a differential probability

of .141. The results of tests of possible interactions between health
status and other variables are discussed below.
Table 7 also shows the strong effect of mandatory retirement within
the

transition

period (R

t+2)

.

Eligibility

for a private pension and/or

19

mandatory retirement beyond t+2 also decreases the probability of continuing

to work. Expectations about social security income do not have a strong
effect. The highest benefit category, however, has a negative coefficient
which is statistically significant at p <

.05.

Education, occupation, hours, and wages. The effects of job—
related variables——hours, wages and occupation——and the education of the

worker are mixed. Ceteris paribus, education and occupation are quite
significant; hours and wages are not. We see that each year of schooling
adds almost one percentage point to the probability of working in the

terminal year. The occupation dummies show that white—collar workers
are much more likely to continue working than are blue—collar workers.
Most of the hours dummies are not significant, but men who work 50 hours
per week or more at time t have a significantly higher probability of

being at work at t+2. This finding is contrary to the results of
Burkhauser and Turner (based on men at younger ages); they suggested that
workers substitute between longer hours and longer labor force

participation.

Perhaps there are other unmeasured characteristics possessed by some men

who "like" to work. The wage variables are not statistically significant,
which is contrary to the cross—section results of Gordon and Blinder, who
estimated wages and included men not at work.

The 1971—73 dummy variable. In contrast to the insignificant
transition dummy in the switching regression, the probability of continuing

to work 1971—73 was significantly lower than in l96c_71. This is the
opposite of what would be expected for cyclical reasons.

The white adult

male unemp1o\ent rate actually fell from 4,0 percent in. l7l to 2.9 percent

20

in 1973 after rising from 1.9 percent in 1969. The sharper decline in
work during the 1971—73 transition is probably the result of a substantial
increase in social security benefits during that period.

Interactions between variables. Several sets of regressions were
run to test for possible interactions among age, health status, class of

worker and pension status. Surprisingly few significant differences emerged.
The most notable interaction is between age and class of worker (see Table 8).
As previously noted (Table 2), there is little difference between self—
employed and wage—and—salary workers in the probability of continuing to

work for the younger men in the sample. At ages 61 (at t) or above, the
class of worker effect is substantial. A similar interaction with age is
observed for the PN/NOR variable. At the older ages in this sample eligibility
for a private pension has a much larger negative effect on the probability
of continuing to work than at the younger ages.
There have been a number of suggestions that the effects of poor
health on labor force participation should vary, depending upon age,
education, class of

worker,

occupation, and the like.' These hypotheses

are not confirmed in this sample. For instance, when the sample is divided

into three groups according to health status,' the coefficients for the
other variables do not vary systematically and significantly with health
status.

A simple summation of the principal findings of the working—not working
regression is presented in Table 9 in the form of estimated probabilities of

working for three hypothetical men: Mr. A, assumed to be a professional,
self—employed, 17 years of schooling, hours
health

50, no work limitation and

above average, no pension or mandatory retirement; Mr. B,

and health

three men the omitted class values are assumed for wages and social security
benefits.

We observe large variation in the probability of continuing to

work among these men, especially at older ages. For Mr. A the probability
of continuing to work is close to unity at all ages through t=65. Mr. B
has a high probability at the younger ages, but it declines with age,
primarily because of the interaction between age and the class of worker
and pension effects. Mr. C has a lower probability even at 58 and 59, and

the probabilityof his continuing towork falls to virtually zero when t=65.

A final regression was run to determine the extent to
which the class of worker differential in the probability of working is
related to greater opportunities for the self—employed to work short hours.
These regressions omitted men who were working fewer than 35 hours per week

at t and men who changed class of work, leaving 5263 observations. Three
possible states at t+2 were specified: working
working

35 hours per week,

35 hours per week, and not working. A polytoinous logit regression

was estimated by maximum likelihood. The coefficients were then used to
calculate the predicted probability of being in each state for the self—
employed and wage—and—salary workers, assuming omitted class for other
categorical variables and mean education (see Table 10).

This analysis suggests that differential opportunity to reduce
weekly hours under 35 does contribute substantially to the class of

40 percent of the working differential of .055 is accounted for by a
differential in the predicted probability of working under 35 hours per

employed than for wage—and—salary workers need to be investigated.

Summary

This longitudinal analysis of the labor market behavior of older
white urban males confirms some previous findings, contradicts others, and

raises new questions for further study. The paper differs from most previous research in this subject by inclusion of the self—employed, by
explicit attention to changes in class of work, and by focusing on the
probability of continuing to work rather than on "retirement" per se.
The -continuing to work regressions provide strong support for the

role of ill health in the labor force decisions of older men. Those men
at work who reported a health—related work limitation at time t were
(ceteris paribus) much less likely to be at work two or four years later.

This is a significant result because it is much less susceptible to the
criticism that "poor health" simply serves as a rationalization for not
working.

Age has a strong effect on the probability of continuing to work,
but there are marked discontinuities in the size of the effect which seem

to be associated with eligibility for social security. The probability
of working at t+2 drops sharply when t is 63. This corresponds with the
'normal" retirement age of 65. A smaller discontinuity is observed when
t+2 is •62, the eligibility age for "early" retirement.

Eligibility for a private pension has a significan.t negative effect

on the probability of continuing to work, and this effect increases with

age. Men working long hours ( 50) are much more likely to continue to
work. Wage rates, on the other hand, do not show a significant effect.
The self—employed are much more likely to continue than are wage—

and—salary workers. This class of worker differential increases with age

27

and seems to be about as large for those who have very recently switched
to self—employment as for those who have been in the class for some time.

A substantial portion of the class—of—worker differential in continuing to
work is accounted for by self—employed who reduce their work week from
more than to less than 35 hours.

The probability of switching regressions reveals that men who change
to self—employment late in life are primarily those who have had previous
experience in self—employment or who are in wage—and—salary occupations
such as managers and salesmen that have many characteristics similar to

self—employment. For instance, men who switch tended to have either very
short or very long work weeks even when they were in wage—and-salary jobs.

The probability of a blue—collar worker with a 40—hour—per—week job switching
to self—employment is extremely small in either of the two—year transitions.

With respect to the five possible explanations for labor force
withdrawal identified in the introduction to this paper,I conclude that
the age of eligibility for social security and poor health are the most
important, private pensions are of some importance, while biologic ageing
and wage effects are of lesser significance.

This paper provides answers to some questions about labor market

behavior, but the results also raise some new questions. Why do the
self—employed continue to work when apparently comparable wage—and—salary

workers stop? Why do they find it easier or more attractive to reduce
their weekly hours below 35 than do wage and salary workers? Why do men
who are working long hours each week have a higher probability of continuing
to work than do those with a normal work week? Why is there (ceteris paribus)
a large white collar—blue collar differential and an education differential

28

in the probability of continuing to work? Apparently there are factors
influencing the labor market behavior of older men that are not captured
by the age, health, wage, pension, and social security variables discussed

by Cordon and Blinder and included in this study. Do self—employment,
education, white collar, and long hours serve as proxies for the utility

or disutility associated with work? Do these variables identify men who
many years ago made life—cycle plans that included higher participation

rates at older ages? Research that helps to clarify the role of these
variables would contribute a great deal to overall understanding of the
labor market behavior of older men.
