ABSTRACT
Numerous studies have examined the effect of cigarette prices on cigarette consumption. These
studies either evaluate the price elasticity of demand for each observation and report the average
price elasticity across all observations or report the price elasticity of demand at the mean of the
price variable. Policy makers rely on these average price elasticity estimates for public health
and revenue generation purposes. The use of an average price elasticity may yield misleading
predictions given the substantial variation in cigarette prices between states. This research is the
first econometric study to examine the price elasticity of cigarette demand at different price
levels. We use aggregate state-level data for years 1991 – 2012 and employ generalized linear
models with log link and gamma distribution to estimate cigarette demand equations. We find
that the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand monotonically increases with price. The
findings from this study will be valuable to policymakers contemplating the use of cigarette
excise taxes to reduce cigarette consumption or to generate revenue.

Introduction
The prevalence of cigarette smoking has declined substantially since the release of the
first Surgeon General’s report on the health effects of smoking in 1964. In 1965, nearly half
(42.4%) of adults aged 18 years and older in the United States were current smokers (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1999). By 2015 (for months January-September),
15.3% of adults 18 years and older in the United States were current smokers (CDC, 2016).
Despite the significant declines in smoking over the past half a century, cigarette use remains the
leading cause of preventable death in the United States fully responsible for more than 480,000
deaths each year (USDHHS, 2014).
Much of the success in reducing cigarette smoking can be attributed to government
tobacco control efforts which began in the mid 1960’s following the release of the first Surgeon
General’s report on smoking (CDC, 1999). While information dissemination and consumer
education were at the core of the government’s tobacco control efforts in the early years, the
campaign against tobacco shifted to public policy interventions (Warner, 2005). Beginning in
the 1980’s federal, state, and local governments began increasing cigarette excise taxes and
enacting restrictions on smoking in public places and worksites in an attempt to decrease
consumption. The smoking restrictions and tax increases continued in the 2000’s at all levels of
government with the restrictions becoming more comprehensive.
In 2002, Delaware became the first state in the union to ban smoking in all private
worksites, restaurants, and bars (CDC, 2011). By April 4, 2016, 24 states and 812 municipalities
had enacted smoking bans in all non-hospitality workplaces, restaurants, and bars (American
Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation (ANRF), 2016a). ANRF estimates that 49.8% of the United

3

States population was covered by 100% smoke-free private worksites, restaurants, and bars laws
on April 4, 2016 (ANRF, 2016b).
Three federal excise tax increases occurred in the 2000’s and 47 states and the District of
Columbia have passed 130 cigarette excise tax increases since January 1, 2000. Moreover,
several local governments have substantially increased cigarette taxes. For example, in 2002
New York City increased its excise tax on cigarettes by $1.42 per pack. Similarly, the city of
Chicago and Cook County, Illinois (which includes Chicago) raised cigarette taxes on 6 separate
occasions since 2004. Combining federal, state, and local level taxes, individuals purchasing
cigarettes in Chicago and New York City pay the highest cigarette excise taxes in the country at
$7.17 and $6.86 per pack, respectively.
For more than a half a century, economists have been interested in how economic forces
affect cigarette consumption. The relationship between cigarette price and cigarette demand has
been the central focus of much of this work. Economists have used diverse data, theoretical
modeling, and empirical strategies to estimate cigarette demand equations. A vast majority of
these studies find clear evidence of a strong inverse relationship between the price individuals
pay for cigarettes and consumption. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
provided a thorough review of the literature based on hundreds of studies. Consensus estimates
from the IARC review imply that a 10 percent increase in cigarette price reduces overall
cigarette consumption by between 2-6 percent (IARC, 2011).
The estimated price elasticities of demand found in the literature vary for a variety of
reasons including the time period examined, the inclusion/exclusion of different confounding
variables, the level of aggregation of the data, and the methods employed in the estimation
process. Researchers typically evaluate the price elasticity of demand for each observation and

4

report the average price elasticity across all observations, or report the price elasticity of demand
at the mean of the price variable. While these average price effects are important, they provide
no information on consumer price responsiveness at different cigarette price levels.
Countries, states, and municipalities have relied on average price elasticity estimates to
predict revenue and cigarette consumption effects associated with changes in cigarette taxes.
The use of an average price elasticity of demand may yield misleading consumption and revenue
predictions as there is tremendous variation in cigarette prices across countries, states, and
municipalities. Indeed, a 10 percent change in price in a low price state may have a very
different effect on cigarette consumption than a 10 percent change in price in a high price state.
No published econometric studies have examined the degree of price responsiveness as cigarette
prices vary. This research is an attempt to fill that void by being the first econometric study to
estimate price elasticities of cigarette demand at different cigarette price levels.
We find that the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand monotonically increases
with price. This makes intuitive sense as a 10 percent increase at a higher price results in a large
absolute monetary increase than 10 percent increase at a lower price and given the lower
affordability of cigarettes in states with high taxes and prices to begin with. The estimates from
this research will be valuable to policy makers attempting to more accurately predict the effects
of cigarette tax increases.
Brief Review of Studies Using Aggregate Data
Researchers have estimated cigarette demand equations using aggregate level data for
more than half a century. Early studies focused on estimating income and price elasticities for a
variety of household goods including cigarettes (for example, see Stone, 1945 and Prest 1949).
Given that the science on the detrimental health effects of smoking was in its infancy stage,

5

cigarettes were treated just like other household items and there was no discussion on the public
health effects associated with taxation or price. As the science on the deleterious health effects
of cigarette smoking became more prevalent, so did the number of published econometric studies
on the demand for cigarettes using aggregate data.
Using meta-analysis methods, Andrews and Franke (1991) quantitatively summarize the
econometric findings on the relationship between cigarette consumption and price. The studies
used in the meta-analysis employed only aggregate level data primarily from the US and UK and
were published between 1933 and 1990. A vast majority of the price elasticity estimates ranged
from -1.0 to -0.10 and the mean price elasticity of demand for the United States for this period
was found to be -0.697. Andrews and Franke (1991) grouped studies into different time periods
and found cigarette demand to become less elastic over time with the average price elasticity of
demand in the latest time period (1970-1990) to be -0.357.
A more recent review of the literature conducted by IARC (2011) that included the US
studies used by Andrews and Franke (1991) and more recent studies found that there is no strong
evidence that the demand for cigarettes in the United States has become less price elastic over
time. The IARC review concludes that the more recent US studies suggest that the range of
estimated price elasticities has narrowed somewhat since the 1970s, with reduced variability,
between -0.6 and -0.2 (IARC, 2011).
Data
We used aggregate state- level data for the United States over the period 1991-2012 in
our analyses. The dependent variable in all models was per-capita tax paid cigarette sales. The
tax paid sales data were obtained from the Tax Burden on Tobacco (Orzechowski and Walker,

6

2014). The sales data for each state were converted to per-capita sales using state annual
population estimates from the United States Census Bureau.
We merged cigarette prices with the sales data. The price data were also obtained from
the annual Tax Burden on Tobacco. These prices are yearly weighted averages for a pack of 20
cigarettes and are inclusive of state-level excise taxes applied to cigarettes. To account for
changes in the relative price of cigarettes over time, all cigarette prices were deflated by the
national Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (1982–1984 = 100).
Cigarette price (in 2012 dollars) ranges from $2.08 to $9.99 per pack in our sample with a mean
price of $4.14 and a standard deviation of $1.36.
We also created a variable to capture the presence and magnitude of smoke free air laws
in each state. In particular, we created a variable that reflect the percent of the state’s population
that is covered by a smoke-free policy prohibiting smoking in private worksites taking into
account both state and local level laws. We created a similar variable reflecting the percent of
the state’s population that is covered by a smoke-free laws prohibiting smoking in restaurants
and another variable for bars. We then created an index variable reflecting the average of these
three variables to capture the magnitude of the population covered by smoke-free air laws.
We created several variables to control for cross-border sales of cigarettes. These
measures are updated versions of what Farrelly et al (2003) employed in their analysis of adult
smoking. Failing to account for cross border sales will bias estimates of the price elasticity of
demand based on sales data away from zero, suggesting that cigarette demand is more responsive
to price than it actually is. Low cigarette price states are likely to have tax paid sales that are in
excess of the actual cigarette consumption of that state, whereas, high cigarette price states are
likely to have tax paid sales that are lower than actual cigarette consumption in that state. Our

7

controls for cross border sales take into account differences in cigarette taxes between states, the
size of border populations, and the distance of these populations to the border. In particular, the
import and export measures follow:

From the United States Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics, we obtained
monthly unemployment rate data for each state and DC. We converted the monthly
unemployment data into fiscal year unemployment numbers. From the United States
Department of Commerce – Bureau of Economic Analysis, we obtained quarterly state specific
personal income data for each state and DC. Again, we converted the quarterly income data into
fiscal year data and deflated by the national Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (1982–1984 = 100) to adjust for inflation. From the United States Department
of Commerce – Census Bureau, we obtained state level population data for each year. We

8

defined variables that represent: the total state population; the percent of the population aged less
than 5, aged 5-17, aged 18-24, aged 25-44, aged 45-64, and aged 65 or older; the percent of the
population that is Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, non-Hispanic American
Indian or Alaskan Native, and non-Hispanic other race/ethnicity. Finally, from the US Census
we received the percent of each state’s population that has less than a high school degree, a high
school degree or some college, and a Bachelors degree or more from college.
Methods
We employed a two-way fixed effects Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to estimate the
per-capita tax paid cigarette sales equations. The use of a GLM requires the selection of a link
function and a distribution function. We used a Box-Cox analysis (1964) to determine the
appropriate link function and a modified Park test (1966) as described by Manning and Mullahy
(2001) to determine the most appropriate distribution to employ. Unlike Park’s original test,
which was designed to test for heteroscedasticity for a specific variable, the modified Park test
checks for a very specific type of heteroscedasticity, one in which the raw-scale variance is a
power function of the raw-scale mean function. Based on the findings of our specification tests,
we determined that a GLM with log-link and Gamma distribution was the most appropriate
functional form to employ to model the per-capita tax paid cigarette sales equations. The twoway fixed effects approach amounts to including a dichotomous indicator for each state (less
one) and each year (less one) as explanatory variables in the models. This assumes that the
differences across states and over time, not captured by the other covariates included in the
model, can be captured by the state and year fixed effects. Finally, the standard errors are
cluster corrected at the state-level using a robust method of calculating the variance covariance
matrix developed by Huber (1967).

9

Table 1 contains the estimates from four alternative models. Model 1 is a basic model
that contains the following covariates: real cigarette price, year fixed effects, and state fixed
effects. Model 2 is identical to Model 1, except Model 2 ads the import and export controls for
cross border sales and the smoke-free air index variable. Model 3 is identical to Model 2, except
Model 3 ads two socio-economic variables: inflation adjusted personal income and
unemployment rate. Model 4 is identical to Model 3, except Model 4 adds the following
demographic variables: gender, age, race, ethnicity, and educational attainment. Some caution
should be used when interpreting the results from model 4 as our identification strategy of
including state fixed effects in the models relies solely on changes in variables within states over
time. There is not much variation year after year within states in gender, age, race, ethnicity, and
educational attainment.
Cigarette Price Results
The average price elasticity of demand across all observations in Models 1, 2, 3, and 4
are -0.77, -0.66, -0.65, and -0.73. These estimates are comparable to previous estimates, but
indicated that cigarette demand in the U.S. during this period is somewhat more responsive to
price than indicated by the consensus estimates of -0.2 to -0.6 found in the literature. Table 2
contains estimates of the price elasticity of demand at different values of cigarette price ranging
from $2 to $10, in $0.50 increments. The absolute value of the price elasticity of demand is
found to monotonically increase with price. The average estimated price elasticity of demand
across the four models is -0.34 at $2 per pack and is -1.70 at $10 per pack. As expected, the
models that control for import and export cross border sales reduce the effect of price on demand
and result in smaller absolute price elasticity estimates. Indeed, the absolute value of the price
elasticity of demand is reduced by 13.81 percent on average when comparing the price elasticity
10

estimates from model 1 to model 2. The inclusion of the socio-economic variables in model 3
reduce the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand by another 1.5% on average compared
to model 2. Finally, when all the demographic variables are added in model 4, the absolute value
of the estimated price elasticities of demand becomes larger than models 2 and 3, but are still
5.4% lower than those estimated in model 1 on average. The inclusion of the demographic
variables in Model 4 results in considerable collinearity among the variables.
Other Results
The fraction of the state that is covered by smoke-free air laws is found to have a
negative effect on cigarette sales in all the models that were estimated. The smoke-free air
results are significant at the 9% level of a one-tailed test in model 3 and at the 12% level of a
one-tailed test in model 2. The negative effect of smoke-free air laws on cigarette consumption
is consistent with a growing number of studies on the effects of smoke-free air laws (IARC,
2009).
While the incentive to import variable is not significant in any model, the incentive to
export has a positive and nearly significant effect on cigarette sales in all the models. The export
incentive finding is consistent with our a priori expectations – states with cigarette taxes that are
low compared to neighboring states have higher tax paid sales because residence close to the
border in the high tax states can purchase cigarettes in low tax states.
An inverse relationship is found between cigarette sales and both the unemployment rate
and inflation adjusted personal income, although the personal income variable fails to meet
significance at conventional levels in Model 4. Controlling for personal income and
unemployment, a positive and significant relationship is found to exist between states that have a
11

high percent of residents that have a high school degree or some college and cigarette sales.
There is a strong inverse relationship between the percent of the population that is Hispanic and
cigarette sales. Finally, there is a positive relationship between states that have a high percent of
residents that are of another race and cigarette sales.
Discussion
States contemplating cigarette excise tax changes have relied on average price elasticity
estimates from the literature when predicting changes in revenue or cigarette consumption.
There is substantial variation in cigarette prices across states and over time and the use of an
average price elasticity may yield misleading predictions if the price elasticity of demand varies
by price. We find that the absolute value of the price elasticity of cigarette demand
monotonically increases with price. At a cigarette price of $2 per pack, the average price
elasticity of demand across the different models is -0.34. This compares to an average price
elasticity of demand across the different models of – 1.70 when the price of a pack of cigarettes
is $10. The estimates from this research will be valuable to policy makers as they will be able to
more accurately predict the effects of cigarette tax increases. For a tax increase that raises
cigarette price by 10%, states that have cigarette taxes/prices above the national average will
generate less additional revenue, but have a greater public health impact compared to states that
have cigarette taxes/prices below the national average, which will collect more additional
revenue, but have less public health benefit.
The results of this research may also shed some light on the possibility that the demand
for cigarettes is becoming less price elastic over time as suggested by Andrews and Franke
(1991) who grouped studies into different time periods and found cigarette demand to become

12

less elastic in the latest time period examined (1970-1990) compared to earlier time periods. The
inflation adjusted price of cigarettes in the United States declines substantially throughout the
1970’s and early 1980’s. Indeed, the real price of cigarettes reached its lowest point on record in
1981, and not until 1987, did the real price revert back to the 1970 level. Our finding that the
absolute value of the price elasticity of demand decreases as price declines is consistent with
studies finding smaller absolute price elasticities of demand during 1970-1990 time period, a
period characterized by very low inflation adjusted prices for cigarettes.
