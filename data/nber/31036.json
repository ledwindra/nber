    "abstract": "\n\nTwo potentially asymmetric players compete for a prize of common value, which is initially unknown, by exerting efforts. A designer has two instruments for contest design. First, she decides whether and how to disclose an informative signal of the prize value to players. Second, she sets the scoring rule of the contest, which varies the relative competitiveness of the players. We show that the optimum depends on the designer\u2019s objective. A bilateral symmetric contest\u2014in which information is symmetrically distributed and the scoring bias is set to offset the initial asymmetry between players\u2014always maximizes the expected total effort. However, the optimal contest may deliberately create bilateral asymmetry\u2014which discloses the signal privately to one player, while favoring the other in terms of the scoring rule\u2014when the designer is concerned about the expected winner\u2019s effort. The two instruments thus exhibit complementarity, in that the optimum can be made asymmetric in both dimensions even if the players are ex ante symmetric. Our results are qualitatively robust to (i) affiliated signals and (ii) endogenous information structure. We show that information favoritism can play a useful role in addressing affirmative action objectives.\n\n",
