Can Universal Screening Increase the Representation of Low Income and Minority Students
in Gifted Education?
David Card and Laura Giuliano
NBER Working Paper No. 21519
September 2015
JEL No. I21
ABSTRACT
Low income and minority students are under-represented in gifted education programs. One explanation
for this pattern is that the usual process for identifying gifted students, through parent and teacher referrals,
systematically misses many potentially qualified disadvantaged students. We use the experiences
in a large urban school district following the introduction of a universal screening program for second
grade students to study this hypothesis. With no change in the standards for gifted eligibility the screening
program led to large increases in the fractions of economically disadvantaged students and minorities
placed in gifted programs. Comparisons of the newly identified gifted students with those who would
have been placed in the absence of screening show that blacks and Hispanics, free/reduced price lunch
participants, English language learners, and girls are all systematically "under-referred" in the traditional
parent/teacher referral system.

Low income and minority students are substantially under‐represented in gifted
and talented education programs in the U.S. (see e.g., Ford, 1998; Donovan and Cross.
2002).1 While some of the gap may be due to differences in the cognitive development
of students from different backgrounds, there is also evidence that the traditional
referral‐based system for identifying gifted children tends to overlook potentially
eligible students from disadvantaged families (e.g., Woods and Achey, 1990; Figlio,
2005; Elhoweris et al., 2005). This raises the question of whether a comprehensive
screening program might be able to identify significant numbers of poor and minority
students who qualify for gifted programs but would go undetected in a referral‐based
system.
We answer this question using data from a unique natural experiment
conducted by one of the largest and most diverse school districts in the country
(hereafter "the District"). State laws governing the District's policies dictate that non‐
disadvantaged students must achieve a minimum of 130 points on a standard IQ test to
be eligible for gifted programs. English language learners (ELL's) and free‐or‐reduced
price lunch (FRL) participants are subject to a lower 116 point threshold, known as "Plan
B" eligibility. Even with this lower bar, however, the District's gifted student population
in the early 2000s was largely comprised of white children from higher‐income
neighborhoods. Only 28% of gifted students in third grade were black or Hispanic,
compared to 60% of all students in the District. Thirteen of the regular elementary
schools in the District had no gifted children in third grade in 2004 or 2005, while the
gifted rate was nearly 10% at the 13 schools with the lowest rates of FRL participation
In response to these disparities the District introduced a universal screening
program in spring 2005. Under this program, all second graders completed a non‐verbal
1

For example, in 2006 the national average participation rates of K‐12 students in gifted and
talented programs was 8.0% for whites, 3.8% for blacks, and 4.2% for Hispanics (U.S.
Department of Education 2010, Table 49). In the large urban district we study, the gifted
program participation rate for students who receive free or reduced price lunches was 1.9% in
the 2004‐5 period, while the rate for other students was 5.5%.

ability test, and those scoring above a threshold of 130 points (for non‐disadvantaged
students) or 115 points (for ELL and FRL participants) were eligible for referral to a
District psychologist for IQ testing.2 As in earlier years students could still be nominated
for testing by parents or teachers, and families could have their children tested privately
and submit the IQ scores to satisfy the state mandate. The screening program was
therefore intended to supplement the traditional referral system, helping to narrow the
gaps in referral rates between students from different backgrounds. Importantly, the IQ
thresholds and other requirements for gifted eligibility were unchanged, so any increase
in the number of students identified as gifted following the introduction of the program
can be attributed to the screening effort, and not to a relaxation of the standards for
gifted status.
Comparisons across cohorts of third‐graders, illustrated in Figure 1, suggest that
the introduction of universal screening led to large increase in the number of gifted
students in third grade in the District. In contrast, the gifted rate in a matched
comparison group of schools from other districts in the same state was quite stable.3 As
a result of financial pressures caused by the Great Recession the District cut its funding
for IQ testing in 2007, and suspended the universal screening program altogether in
2010. Thus, the original program was short‐lived, and by 2011 the fraction of gifted
third graders in the District was back down to the level of 2004‐2005. At the same time
the gifted rate in the comparison schools began to increase after 2007, reflecting
program changes in other districts.
In light of the history of the District's screening program and the striking patterns
in Figure 1, in this paper we focus on simple "pre/post" comparisons between third
graders in 2004‐2005 (the two cohorts immediately before the introduction of universal
screening) and those in 2006‐2007 (the two cohorts immediately after). We present

As discussed below, the District used the Naglieri Non‐verbal Ability Test (NNAT), rescaled to
have mean 100 and standard deviation 15, for screening.

evidence confirming that the 2004‐2005 ("pre") cohorts form a credible comparison
group for the 2006‐2007 ("post") cohorts. We use differences between these groups to
measure the impact of the program on gifted participation rates and to characterize two
key groups of participants: students who were classified as gifted in the post cohort and
would have been identified in the pre cohort; and those who were classified as gifted in
the post cohort but would have been overlooked in the pre cohort. These are
equivalent to the "always takers" and the "compliers" in a standard analysis of
experimental designs with incomplete compliance (e.g., Imbens and Angrist, 1995). By
studying the characteristics of the compliers and their distribution across schools we
gain important new insights into the types of students who would normally "fall through
the cracks" of the traditional referral system for gifted education programs.
Our analysis points to four main conclusions. First, as shown in Figure 1, the
introduction of the screening program led to a large increase in the fraction of students
classified as gifted, with no cut in the standards for gifted certification. Second, the
newly identified gifted students were disproportionately poor, black, and Hispanic, and
more likely to have parents who speak a language other than English. They were also
concentrated at schools with high shares of poor and minority students and low
numbers of gifted students prior to the program. Thus, the experiences of the District
confirm that universal screening can significantly increase the representation of
disadvantaged students in gifted and talented programs. Third, the distribution of IQ
scores for the newly identified students was very similar to the distribution among those
who were identified under the referral system, particularly among students who
qualified under the Plan B eligibility standard. The compliers included many students
with IQ's significantly above the minimum eligibility threshold, implying that even
relatively high ability students from disadvantaged backgrounds were being overlooked
under the traditional referral system. Finally, comparisons of the achievement gains
made between the end of third grade and the end of fourth grade suggest that the
newly identified gifted students benefitted at least as much from participating in the

3

gifted program as the always taker group who would have identified under a referral
system.

I. Background: The Referral Process and the Screening Program
Prior to the introduction of the screening program candidates for gifted status in
the District were identified through an informal process of parent and teacher referrals.
Referrals were concentrated in first and second grades to ensure that qualified students
could begin receiving gifted services by third grade.4 Nominees were placed in a queue
for a free evaluation and IQ test by a District psychologist. Parents could also bypass the
queue by hiring a private psychologist and submitting the IQ score directly. Students
with IQ’s above the relevant threshold were eligible for gifted status, 5 with the final
determination based on parent and teacher inputs and scores on a checklist verifying
that the student showed evidence of "gifted indicators," including motivation, creativity,
and adaptability.6 The referral and evaluation process remained unchanged after the
introduction of the screening program and is still in place today.
There is a thriving private market for IQ testing in the District, with many
psychologists offering first‐time IQ tests and re‐testing for children who failed to meet
the state mandated standards on an earlier test.7 Advertisements posted by these
psychologists suggest that their target market is mainly non‐disadvantaged families
whose children have to meet the 130 point IQ threshold (known as the "Plan A"
eligibility rule). The importance of private testing for these families is underscored by an
analysis of the testing records for students who were placed in the gifted program by
4

More information on the District's gifted program is presented in Card and Giuliano (2014). In
most schools gifted programming starts in third grade, and in fourth and fifth grades students
are placed in separate classes designated for gifted and high‐achieving students.
5
The state law actually allows students to score within a standard error (3 points) of the IQ
threshold and still be placed in the gifted program. A small fraction of gifted students have
scores 1,2 or 3 points below the mandated threshold.

The eligibility checklist for Plan B students also includes measures of academic achievement
and family background factors.

end of third grade in the 2004 and 2005. Among the Plan A eligible students, 20% were
qualified on the basis of a private IQ test. In contrast, less than 1% of the Plan B eligible
students were qualified through a private test.
Under the screening program, introduced in spring 2005, all second graders in
the District completed the Naglieri Non‐Verbal Ability Test (NNAT) (see Naglieri and
Ford, 2003). The NNAT test ‐‐ which is similar to Raven's Progressive Matrix Test ‐‐ takes
less than an hour to complete and was administered by second grade teachers during
regular class time. Non‐disadvantaged students scoring above 130 points on the test,
and ELL/FRL students scoring above 115 points were eligible for referral for IQ testing.8
The aim of the program was to identify high‐ability students and have them tested
relatively quickly so they could begin receiving gifted services in third grade. Consistent
with this objective, our analysis of records for gifted students in the third grade cohorts
of 2006 and 2007 suggests that most completed an IQ test by December of the
preceding year.
A key feature of the screening program was the need to increase the number of
IQ tests performed by District psychologists. We estimate that about 1,300 additional
IQ tests were conducted by District staff in the summer and fall after the first screening
test in spring 2005, and a similar number of extra tests were performed in 2006. Since
each test takes approximately 3 hours, the cost in overtime payments for testing staff
was relatively large. In response to a budget crisis in 2007, the District decided to cut
the overtime budget for testing staff. The result, clearly evident in Figure 1, was a sharp
decline in the fraction of students placed in the gifted program by the end of third
grade. Continuing budget pressures led the District to suspend the screening program
altogether in 2011.

8

Teachers were supposed to fill out a checklist of qualifications and only refer students with
sufficiently high scores on the checklist, in anticipation of the checklist requirement for gifted
placement.

II. Data Description and Research Design
Our main data source for evaluating the effects of the District's screening
program consists of longitudinal records for elementary students who were enrolled in
third grade during spring semester of years from 2004 to 2007. We restrict attention to
students who attended one of the 140 larger elementary schools in the District,
excluding those at charter schools and other special schools. For our analysis sample we
also exclude students who repeated third grade. Thus every student was in third grade
during the 4‐year sample period and would have written the screening test (if one was
available) in the spring of the previous calendar year.
Column 1 of Table 1 presents some descriptive information on the roughly
40,000 third graders in our analysis sample during the pre‐screening period (2004 and
2005).9 The District's student body is racially diverse, with 35% white non‐Hispanic
students, 34% black non‐Hispanics, 25% Hispanics, and 3% Asians. Some 45% of third
graders in these cohorts were eligible for free or reduced price lunches (FRL), and 11%
were English language learners (ELL). Altogether 49% of third graders were either FRL or
FRL and were therefore eligible for gifted status under the state's Plan B standard. The
other 51% had to meet the regular (Plan A) eligibility requirements.
Columns 3 and 5 show the characteristics of the Plan A and Plan B eligible
students, respectively. White and Asian students are over‐represented in the Plan A
group while blacks and Hispanics are over‐represented in the Plan B group. We also
report the overall fractions of FRL and black or Hispanic students at the schools
attended by the two groups. Plan B eligibles attended schools with higher fractions of
minority and FRL participants, reflecting residential segregation patterns in the District
and the fact that school assignment is neighborhood based.
The lower panel of the Table presents information on IQ testing rates, mean IQ
scores (for students who are tested), and gifted status as of the end of third grade.
9

For convenience, from now on we refer to cohorts by the year that they were in spring
semester of third grade.

6

Overall about 16% of third graders in the District in 2004‐2005 had an IQ score on
record, with an average score of just over 100 points. Not all these students were
tested to screen for gifted status. Many students are tested for diagnostic purposes,
including the detecting of learning disabilities. Overall about 4% of students in the
2004‐2005 cohorts had an IQ score above their respective eligibility threshold for
potential gifted status, and 3.3% were classified as gifted. Despite the lower threshold
for Plan B eligible group the gifted rate was still much lower for these students (1.5%)
than for the Plan A group (5.1%).
Columns 2, 4, and 6 report the characteristics of third grade students in the
District in the two years after the introduction of the screening program. Overall, these
students are very similar to those in the two earlier cohorts, with the only notable
difference being a small decline in the fraction of whites, offset by small rises in the
fractions of black and Hispanic students. Given this stability, and the relatively smooth
trend in economic conditions in the District's metropolitan area between mid‐2004 and
mid‐2007, 10 we believe that student outcomes in 2004‐2005 represent a credible
counterfactual for the outcomes of students in 2006‐2007, particularly if we adjust for a
trend to capture long‐run demographic shifts and the gradually improving economic
climate.
The validity of this interrupted time series design is supported by the patterns in
Figure 1, which show that between 2004 and 2007 the fraction of gifted children in third
grade in a matched comparison group of schools from the same state was relatively
stable (3.5% in 2004, 3.6% in 2005, and 3.7% in 2006 and 2007). Thus, for most of our
analysis below we use a simple pre/post "differences" design, though we also report
some results based on comparisons of publically available school/grade level data from
other districts to verify that the fraction of gifted third graders in other medium and
large districts were very stable between the pre and post periods.

The unemployment rate in the local MSA was 5.6% in March 2004, 3.7% in March 2005, 2.7%
in March 2006, and 2.8% in March 2007.

III. Impacts of the Screening Program on Testing and Gifted Rates
a. Screening Test Outcomes, IQ Testing, and Gifted Placement
The screening tests in spring 2005 and spring 2006 revealed that approximately
13 percent of Plan A‐eligible students and 18 percent of Plan B‐eligible students had
NNAT scores above the 130 and 115 point thresholds, respectively. Unfortunately, we
do not have direct information on which students were referred for IQ testing as a result
of their scores. As shown in columns 2, 4, and 6 of Table 1, however, the overall fraction
of third graders with an IQ test rose by 8 percentage points (ppt.) between the pre and
post cohorts, with a 5 ppt. gain for Plan A eligible students and an 11 ppt. gain for the
Plan B eligibles. This extra testing resulted in a 3 ppt. rise in the overall fraction of third
graders with an IQ test score above the threshold for gifted eligibility, with a 2 ppt. gain
for the Plan A eligibles and a 4 ppt. gain for the Plan B group. Most importantly, the
fraction of students placed in the gifted program rose by 2.2 ppt. relative to the pre
cohorts, with a 1.5 ppt. gain for the Plan A group and a 2.9 ppt. gain for the Plan B
group.11
Further insights into the impacts of the screening program are revealed by
Figures 2a and 2b, which show how IQ testing rates and gifted rates were related to
NNAT screening test results for students in the post cohorts.12 The design of the
screening program implies that IQ testing rates and gifted rates should jump
discontinuously at the screening thresholds if the program operated as intended. To aid
in interpreting the figures, we also show local linear regression discontinuity style

11

A complicating issue is that some Plan B eligible students in second grade change status in
third grade. These are mainly English learners who transition out of the language program after
second grade. These students can be referred for IQ testing and placed in the gifted program as
Plan B eligible, but recorded as Plan A eligible in third grade. As discussed below, we estimate
that this group accounts for about one‐third of the newly identified students coded as Plan A
eligible in third grade.
12
Note that the figures are based on data for students who were in the District in second grade
at the time of the screening test and enrolled in third grade in a District school the next year.

8

models fit separately to observations above and below the respective screening
thresholds. Estimates of these models are reported in Appendix Table 1.
Looking first at the results in Figure 2a for Plan A eligible students, students who
scored just under the screening test threshold of 130 points had a 38% probability of
being IQ tested, whereas those who scored just above the threshold had a 58% chance
of being tested. Thus, passing the screening test threshold was associated with a 20
percentage point increase in the probability of IQ testing for Plan A eligible students.
Nevertheless, even non‐disadvantaged students with NNAT scores well above the
threshold had a less than 100% chance of being IQ tested within the next year.
The corresponding jump in the probability of having an IQ score above the gifted
program minimum is 7 ppt., implying that about one‐third of Plan A eligible students
who were referred for IQ testing as a result of barely passing the screening threshold
had an IQ score of 130 points or higher. There is also about a 7 ppt. jump in the
probability of being placed as a gifted student, which suggests that most of the newly
identified Plan A eligible students with NNAT scores just above the screening threshold
were actually placed in the gifted program.
The results in Figure 2b for Plan B eligible students show some important
differences with the results for the Plan A group. Just to the left of the 115 point
threshold the IQ testing rate for the Plan B group was about 10% ‐ only 1/4 of the
testing rate for Plan A eligibles with scores just under 130 points.13 This disparity is
consistent with concerns that many disadvantaged students with ability levels around
the threshold for gifted status were being overlooked in the traditional referral system.
In contrast, the IQ testing rate for Plan B eligibles with screening scores just above the
115 point threshold is about the same as the rate for Plan A eligibles just above their
threshold (around 60% in both cases). This suggests that the "marginally qualified" Plan

13

In fact it seems likely that most of the Plan B group just below the screening test threshold
who had an IQ test on record were tested for some reason other than to check for gifted
eligibility, so the disparity is even larger.

9

A and Plan B groups were treated equally in the post‐screening referral process,
effectively closing the gap in referral rates for students just above the screening bar.
Looking at the fraction of the Plan B group with IQ scores of 116 or higher, and
the fraction who were placed in the gifted program, both are very close to zero for
students with an NNAT score just under the Plan B screening threshold (115 points). For
those with a screening score just above the threshold, on the other hand, the fraction
with an IQ score of 116 or more is 16% and the fraction classified as gifted is 10%. Thus,
about one quarter of the newly identified Plan B group who were IQ tested as a result of
an NNAT score just above the threshold had IQ's of 116 points or higher ‐‐ a "success
rate" somewhat below the 30% rate for Plan A eligibles with NNAT scores just above
130. Only 60% of the marginal Plan B group with IQ scores above 116 were actually
placed in the gifted program, however, compared with a nearly 100% placement rate for
marginal Plan A students with IQ scores above 130.
To help better understand the determinants of which disadvantaged students
were actually IQ tested as a result of the screening program, and which of those with
high enough IQ's were placed in the gifted program, we fit a series of descriptive models
to the universe of Plan B students in the post cohorts who had NNAT scores above the
115 point screening threshold. We fit separate models for being IQ tested; having an IQ
score of 116 or higher if tested; and being placed in the gifted program if IQ‐qualified.
The results are reported in Table 2. For each of the three outcomes we present three
specifications: a basic model with only demographic characteristics of students and their
NNAT scores; a second model with school dummies that control for potential
unobserved factors across different schools (e.g., teacher or principal enthusiasm for
the screening program); and a third model with school dummies and a control for the
student's third grade scores on statewide achievement tests.14

14

Statewide testing only starts in third grade so we have no second grade achievement scores.
Third grade scores may be affected by gifted placement, though other research (e.g., Card and
Giuliano, 2014; Bui, Craig and Imberman, 2011) suggests the effect is probably very small.

10

The models for IQ testing (in columns 1‐3) show that students with higher
NNAT's were more likely to be tested ‐‐ consistent with the simple patterns in Figure 2b.
Testing rates were also higher for Asian students, younger students, and those with
higher third grade achievement scores. Models for the likelihood of having an IQ score
above the state threshold (columns 4‐6) suggest that this probability was higher for
students with higher NNAT scores, lower for older students, black students and female
students, and much higher for those with higher achievement levels. Finally, models for
the probability of placement in the gifted program conditional on having an IQ score
above the minimum threshold (columns 7‐9) suggest that these rates were slightly
higher for black and Hispanic students, higher for Asian students, lower for ELL students,
and much higher for students with higher levels of achievement.
To illustrate the implications of the achievement score effects from the models
in columns 3, 6 and 9 of Table 2, consider the effect of a 1 standard deviation higher
achievement score (holding constant NNAT scores and other factors). This would lead to
a 7 ppt. increase in the likelihood of being IQ tested, a 22 ppt. increase in the likelihood
of actually scoring above the 116 point threshold on an IQ test, and a 21 ppt. increase in
the likelihood of being placed in the gifted program, conditional on scoring at least 116
on the IQ test. These estimates suggest that the referral, testing, and placement system
operated by the District after the introduction of the screening test selectively pushed
higher‐achieving Plan B eligibles into the gifted program, while holding back "under‐
achievers" with adequate NNAT scores or IQ scores but lower achievement levels. This
pattern is broadly consistent with the guidelines teachers were expected to use in
deciding which students to refer for IQ testing once the screening test scores were
available, and with the checklist used in combination with IQ scores to determine gifted
placement of Plan B students.

11

b. Net Impacts of the Screening Program on Rates of Gifted Placement
With this background we now turn to estimates of the impact of the screening
program on the fraction of gifted students in the District, summarized in Table 3. We
begin in Panel A with estimates based on the same publically available school/grade
data used in Figure 1.15 Row 1 shows the mean fraction of third grade gifted students in
the District in the pre and post years, and the change in this fraction, which is 1.7 ppt..
Row 2 shows the difference in the fraction gifted between schools in the District and a
comparison group of schools in other districts in the state.16 This gap corresponds to
the difference in the fraction gifted between District schools and the comparison group
schools in Figure 1. The difference of differences between District schools and
comparison group schools is 1.6 ppt., with a standard error (clustered by school) of 0.3
ppt.. We also fit a model which allows gifted rates at schools in the state to have a
trend over time. The difference in differences from this model, presented in column 4,
is virtually the same as the entry in column 3.
A possible concern with the estimates in rows 1 and 2 is that their precision is
over‐stated by the presence of unobserved district‐wide factors that cause the fraction
of gifted children to vary from year to year. Such factors are not incorporated in the
standard errors reported in the table. To assess the likely importance of district‐level
error components in the fraction of gifted students, we constructed the empirical
distribution of changes in the average fraction of third graders in gifted programs from
2004‐5 to 2006‐7 for the 23 larger districts in the state (those with at least 20
15

These data are available from the state testing agency, and report the numbers and
characteristics of students who took the statewide achievement tests in each school, grade, and
year. For consistency with our student level data, we select larger elementary schools (at least
40 third graders in each year) that are not classified as charter schools.
16
We fit a propensity score model to the pooled sample of larger District schools and larger non‐
charter schools in other districts, and used the estimated scores to weight the data for the
comparison schools. The variables included in the propensity score model were: mean fraction
gifted in 2004‐5, mean FRL participation rate of third graders in 2004‐5, 2006‐8, and 2009‐11,
mean fraction of blacks and Hispanics among third graders in 2004‐5, 2006‐8, and 2009‐11, and
mean number of third grade students in all years 2004‐2011.

12

elementary schools), including the District (which, with 140 elementary schools is one of
the largest in the state).17 We show this distribution in Figure 3, along with the
confidence intervals associated with the changes in the fraction of gifted students in
each district. Two features are clear from the figure. First, among other larger districts
the variability in the fraction gifted between the pre and post cohorts is relatively small.
Second, relative to this distribution the change in the fraction gifted in the District is a
clear outlier.18 We conclude that a simple within‐District differences analysis provides a
plausible estimate of the effect of the screening program on the overall fraction of
gifted third graders.
Panel B of Table 3 shows within‐District differences estimates based on student
level data for schools in the District. For each student group we present a simple
difference estimate in column 3 and a trend‐adjusted difference in column 4. The
results for all third grade students (row 3) show a slightly larger increase than the
aggregated school‐level data, but the trend adjusted difference is nearly identical to our
difference‐in‐differences estimate. In the lower rows we present estimated impacts for
various subgroups of third graders. The trend‐adjusted impacts (which we prefer) are
relatively small for Plan A eligibles and whites, while the impacts for Plan B eligibles,
blacks, and Hispanics are all relatively large. 19
To interpret these estimated impacts it is helpful to translate the percentage
point effects into numbers of gifted third graders. The trend adjusted difference
estimates suggest that the screening program added about 300 gifted students to the
total in the District, consisting of roughly 60 (20%) Plan A eligibles and 240 (80%) Plan B
17

We exclude one other district which adopted a screening program in 2005. The change in the
gifted fraction in this district is 1.76 ppt., just a little larger than the change in the District.
18
The empirical mean and standard deviation of the changes in fraction gifted across the 22
other districts in the state are ‐0.001 and 0.007, respectively. The observed change in the
District is 2.65 standard deviations from the mean for the other districts, which can be
interpreted as a t‐test statistic.
19
As shown in Appendix Figures 1a and 1b, there are clearly positive trends in the gifted rates of
various subgroups of student in the District.

eligibles. The added Plan B's represent a 180% increase in the total number of
disadvantaged gifted students in third grade relative to the numbers in 2004/2005. The
percentage impacts on the numbers of black and Hispanic students in the District gifted
program are also very large: around an 80% increase in the number of black
participants, and a 130% increase in the number of Hispanic participants.

IV. A Closer Look at the Newly Identified Gifted Students
a. Student Characteristics
The evidence in Table 3 suggests that the changes in gifted participation rates
caused by the District's screening program were very different across economic and
racial groups. Table 4 presents a more systematic analysis that allows us to compare
the newly identified gifted students ‐‐ the "compliers" whose gifted status was changed
by the screening program ‐‐ to the students who would have been identified under the
traditional referral system. We begin in columns 1 and 2 by showing the fractions of all
gifted students in the pre cohorts and the post cohorts with the characteristic identified
in the row heading. In the absence of the screening program or any trend factors
affecting the total fraction of District students with the characteristic, the fractions
would expected to be the same in the two cohorts. The characteristics of the complier
group, in column 3, can be identified by comparing fractions in the two cohorts and
adjusting for any trend across the 4 years in our sample.20 Finally, in column 4 we show
the difference in means between the compliers and the group of gifted students
identified in the pre cohorts through the traditional referral system.
Several interesting patterns emerge from this analysis. As noted in the
discussion of Table 3, about 80% of the compliers were Plan B eligibles. They are
20

Specifically the estimates in columns (3) and (7) are calculated as the trend‐adjusted change in
the population share that is gifted and has the characteristic in question divided by the change
in the population share that is gifted. To calculate the standard errors for these estimates and
those in columns (4) and (8) we estimate the changes simultaneously using Stata’s suest
command and allow for clustering by school.

disproportionately black and Hispanic, and substantially less likely to have English‐
speaking parents. The newly identified group also attended schools with relatively high
fractions of FRL participants and non‐white students. Girls are more likely to be
identified through screening than boys, whereas under the traditional referral system
girls were under‐represented in the District's gifted program.
The bottom two rows of the table show mean third grade math and reading
scores and mean IQ scores of the various groups of gifted students. The newly
identified students have about 0.4 standard deviation units lower third grade test scores
than the always takers, and IQ scores that are about 0.5 standard deviation units below
the scores of the always takers. In interpreting the IQ gap, however, it is important to
keep in mind that most of the complier group are Plan B eligible, and therefore subject
to a lower IQ threshold than the Plan A group who comprise the majority of the always
takers.
Given this fact it is useful to focus on comparisons among the Plan B eligible
subpopulation only. We report a parallel analysis for this group in columns 5‐8 of Table
4. Note that the characteristics of the Plan B compliers, reported in column 7, are quite
similar to the characteristics of all compliers reported in column 3, reflecting the fact
that 80% of all compliers are Plan B eligible. In contrast, the Plan B always takers
(summarized in column 5) are different from the overall sample of always takers (in
column 1). Overall the gaps between these two Plan B groups are modest, though the
compliers are less likely to be white, and more likely to be Hispanic, ELL, and to have
non English speaking parents than the group of Plan B eligibles who were identified
using traditional referrals. These gaps suggest that language may be a particularly
important barrier preventing the identification of qualified gifted children in a referral‐
based system.
Looking at the last two rows of the table for the Plan B group, the compliers have
lower achievement scores than the always takers, but about the same mean IQ scores.
On average, it appears that the traditional referral system tends to overlook

15

disadvantaged students with modest achievement levels, regardless of their cognitive
abilities. Teachers and parents may simply not recognize the abilities of many students
− particularly those from poor and immigrant family backgrounds.
Further insights into the cognitive abilities of the compliers are provided in
Figure 4, which plots the distribution of IQ scores of always takers and compliers in the
Plan A and Plan B gifted populations in 2006 and 2007. Looking first at the data for the
Plan B group, note that the two distributions are very fairly similar, though the
compliers are less likely to have scores very close to the cutoff. Twenty percent of the
compliers have IQ scores of 130s points or higher (versus 25% of the always takers),
suggesting that many high‐ability disadvantaged students are at risk of being overlooked
in a traditional parent/teacher referral system.
The distributions of scores for compliers and always takers in the Plan A group
are also interesting. About 30% of the compliers have scores under 125 points, versus
8% of the always takers. These are students who were classified as Plan B eligible at the
time they were tested, but by end of third grade are Plan A eligible (mainly because they
transition out of English language learning status). Taking account of this group, about
85% of all the newly identified gifted students were drawn from the Plan B pool. As
with the Plan B compliers, many of the newly identified Plan A gifted students have IQ
scores well above the minimum threshold, suggesting that the traditional referral
system also misses some high ability non‐disadvantaged students.

b. School Distribution
A troubling feature of the District's gifted education program prior to the
introduction of the screening program was the very unequal distribution of gifted
students across schools. This situation is illustrated by the blue line in Figure 5, which
shows a "q‐q" plot of the cumulative distribution of gifted 3rd grade students in the
2004‐2005 cohorts among the 140 larger elementary schools in the District against the
cumulative distribution of all 3rd grade students. (The schools are ranked by their

16

fraction gifted, with the first school contributing the largest relative share of gifted
students). Fifty percent of gifted students in the pre cohort were at schools that
enrolled only 18% of the entire District third grade population, while one half of all
students in the District were at schools that enrolled a total of only 16% of the gifted
students.
The effect of the introduction of the screening program is illustrated by the
green line in the figure, which shows the q‐q plot for the 2006 and 2007 cohorts. This
line is much closer to the 45 degree line, implying a more equal distribution of gifted
students across schools. In particular, after the introduction of screening all schools had
at least 1 gifted 3rd grade student in 2006 or 2007, whereas in the pre cohorts, 13
schools had no gifted students in 2004 or 2005. The third (red) line in the figure shows
the distribution of the compliers across schools. This line is (mostly) below the 45
degree line, implying that relatively few compliers were identified at the schools with
the high fraction of gifted students in the pre cohort, whereas relatively more were
identified at schools with low gifted rates in the pre cohort.

V. Academic Performance of the Newly Identified Gifted Students
One of the potential concerns with a screening program is that the newly
identified students will be "mismatched" and will not benefit as much from the gifted
program as traditionally referred students. Such arguments are often made against
other outreach efforts, including programs to expand minority representation in elite
universities (e.g., Arcidiacono et al., 2012). The newly identified students may also
disrupt the quality of gifted services for other students, undermining the value of the
program (Golden, 2004). Given the large increase in the number of gifted students
following the introduction of the District's screening program, and the high fraction of
poor and minority students among the newly identified group, it is useful to examine
the potential effects on academic performance of the District's gifted student body.

17

To develop some simple evidence on this question we use the distribution of test
score gains in reading and math between third and fourth grade for gifted students in
the pre and post cohorts.21 Most gifted students in the District have already received
some limited services by the end of third grade, such as individualized instruction in
math or reading. In fourth grade, however, all gifted students are placed in designated
classes for gifted students and other high achievers (see Card and Giuliano, 2014) and
also receive a full year of gifted services. Arguably, the test score gains between third
and fourth grade can provide useful, albeit noisy information on the degree to which
students are successfully adapting to gifted education.22
We began by measuring a reference distribution of test score gains, using the
entire population of gifted students in the 2004 and 2005 cohorts. We then calculated
the distributions of test score gains for gifted students in the 2006 and 2007 cohorts,
classifying these students into 3 groups, based on the relative fraction of newly
identified gifted students in the 2006/2007 cohorts at their school. In the lowest tercile
schools there were very few newly identified gifted students, and we would expect the
distribution of test score gains for students in these schools to closely match the
reference distribution. In the highest tercile schools, on the other hand, most of the
gifted students were in the newly identified group. If these students were "mismatched"
to gifted education we would expect their distribution of test score gains to be shifted
left relative to the reference distribution. Finally, at the middle tercile schools there was
a combination of always takers and compliers. If, for example, the compliers were
mismatched and their presence harmed the quality of education for the always takers,
then we would also expect the distribution of gains to lie to the left of the reference
distribution for students at these schools.

21

We use each student's standardized scores in reading and math in statewide tests at the end
of third and fourth grades to measure the change in scores or the "gain score".
22
Very few students’ standardized scores are top coded so we are not concerned that the tests
have no power to measure achievement gains for gifted children.

18

The results of our comparisons are presented in Figure 6. We show the
distributions of gains in each tercile group, along with the reference distribution. For
each group we also note the share of newly identified gifted students. As expected, at
the schools with the lowest fraction of newly identified gifted students we see that the
distribution of test score gains is virtually identical to the reference distribution. This is
reassuring since it also means that differences in the statewide test instruments used in
different years do not have much effect on measured gain scores. In the second tercile,
where about 35% of gifted students in the 2006‐2007 cohorts were newly identified by
screening, the distribution of gains is shifted slightly to the right relative to the reference
distribution, showing no indication of a disruptive effect on the always takers. At the
third tercile schools, where about three quarters of the gifted students in 2006‐2007
were newly identified by the screening program, the distribution is also shifted slightly
to the right relative to the reference distribution.
While a full analysis of the effects of participating in gifted education for
different groups of students is beyond the scope of this paper, we view the results in
Figure 6 as suggestive that if anything, the newly identified students benefitted even
more from participating in gifted education than did the group of always takers who be
identified under a traditional referral system. Moreover, the patterns at the middle
tercile schools suggest that any spillover effect on the always takers were small.

VI. Conclusions
A longstanding concern about gifted education programs is the under
representation of disadvantaged groups, including minorities, non‐native English
speakers, and children from poor families. In response, a substantial body of research
has focused on alternative methods for assessing giftedness that are less reliant on
standard IQ tests (e.g., Renzulli, 1978; Borland and Wright, 1994; Naglieri and Ford,
2003; VanTassel‐Baska, Feng and Evans, 2007). Over the past 30 years states and school
districts have introduced multiple criteria for determining giftedness (e.g., grids using a

19

combination of IQ and achievement) and also adopted different thresholds for
disadvantaged groups (McClain and Pfeiffer, 2012). Nevertheless, the fractions of black
and Hispanic students in gifted programs remain far below the fraction of whites and
Asians, and disparities between socioeconomic groups persist.
An alternative and complementary explanation for the under‐representation gap
is that the traditional referral process for identifying gifted students tends to
systematically miss many potentially qualified disadvantaged students. The experiences
in the District following the introduction of universal screening for second graders
strongly support this hypothesis. With no change in the minimum standards for gifted
status the screening program led to a 180% increase in the gifted rate among all
disadvantaged students, with a 130% increase for Hispanic students and an 80%
increase for black students.
A comparison of the newly identified gifted students to those who would have
been identified even without screening shows that black and Hispanic students,
free/reduced price lunch participants, English language learners, and girls were all
systematically "under‐referred" to the gifted program. Newly identified gifted students
were more likely to come from schools in poor neighborhoods with relatively few gifted
students, leading to a substantial equalization in gifted participation rates across
schools. On average the newly identified students also had IQ scores that were similar
to those of the always takers in the same eligibility group, though they had lower
standardized achievement scores. We hypothesize that parents and teachers often fail
to recognize the potential of many poor and immigrant children with less than stellar
achievement levels, accounting for their likelihood of being under‐referred.
An important limitation of our analysis is that it pertains to only a single school
district. While the student population in the District is highly diverse, and arguably
representative of the student population in many other large urban districts, the gifted
program offered by the District has a number of distinctive features, including a
minimum IQ threshold with a lower bar for free/reduced price lunch participants and

20

English language learners. Prior to the introduction of the screening program the
District had relatively low gifted participation rates (around 3.5% for third graders),
reflecting the importance of the IQ thresholds. At a minimum, however, our findings
suggest that the under‐representation of poor and minority students in gifted education
is not due solely to the lower IQ scores of these students. A substantial share of the gap
appears to be caused by the failure of the traditional parent/teacher referral system to
identify high‐ability disadvantaged students.
