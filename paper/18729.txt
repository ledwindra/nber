ABSTRACT
Protecting the environment during economic growth is a challenge facing every country. This paper
focuses on two regulatory measures that China has adopted to incentivize air quality improvement:
publishing a daily air pollution index (API) for major cities since 2000 and linking the API to performance
evaluations of local governments. In particular, China defines a day with an API at or below 100 as
a blue sky day. Starting in 2003, a city with at least 80% blue sky days in a calendar year (among other
criteria) qualified for the “national environmental protection model city” award. This cutoff was increased
to 85% in 2007.
Using officially reported API data from 37 large cities during 2000-2009, we find a significant discontinuity
at the threshold of 100 and this discontinuity is of a greater magnitude after 2003. Moreover, we find
that the model cities were less likely to report API right above 100 when they were close to the targeted
blue sky days in the fourth quarter of the year when or before they won the model city award. That
being said, we also find significant correlation of API with two alternative measures of air pollution
– namely visibility as reported by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and Aerosol Optical
Depth (AOD), corrected for meteorological conditions, from NASA satellites. The discontinuity around
100 suggests that count of blue sky days could have been subject to data manipulation; nevertheless,
API does contain useful information about air pollution.

1. Introduction
Protecting the environment during economic growth is a challenge facing
every country. Because private sectors may not fully internalize the environmental
consequences of their activity, environmental protectionists have called for
government regulation. Existing research has examined the effect of
environmental regulations on firm behavior1, environmental measures2, and health
outcomes3, but few studies look at the policies that motivate local governments to
reduce pollution.4 Nevertheless, a great number of international treaties have
been established, with the assumption that each targeted government, facing the
incentives specified in an international treaty, can effectively reduce pollution in
or near its territory. Unfortunately, any policy that motivates local governments to
reduce pollution can also motivate them to report better outcomes on paper,
especially if it is more costly to make actual improvements, if gaming is difficult
to detect, and if enforcement relies on self-reporting due to a lack of
disaggregated objective data.
China provides a unique opportunity to study local government incentives
in environmental protection. While China has enjoyed steady GDP growth for the
past 30 years, 16 of the world’s top 20 most polluted cities were located in China
as of 2007.5 Given the regional decentralized authoritarian (RDA) regime in
China, Xu (2011) argues that local government officials have an incentive to
sacrifice environmental protection in order to boost local GDP growth. This is
because local government leaders are appointed by the central government based
on local performance, and GDP growth is easier to measure than environmental
conditions. To be fair, the central government is aware of the problem and has

the US. A number of other studies focus on the effect of environmental regulations on trade flow,
capital flow, and international pollution havens, for example, Dean, Lovely and Wang (2009),
Ederington, Levinson and Minier (2005), Keller and Levinson (2002), Wheeler (2004), and Zeng

Games on Beijing’s air quality.

environmental policy.

incorporated some environmental measures into the performance evaluation
criteria. Lessons learned from these environmental incentives are likely to have
important implications for crafting other domestic and international policies that
target local governments for environmental protection.
This paper focuses on two regulatory measures that China has adopted to
incentivize local governments to improve air quality: one is publishing daily air
pollution index (API) for 86 cities since 2000; the other is linking the API to
performance evaluation of local governments. In particular, China defines a day
with an API at or below 100 as a blue sky day. Starting in 2003, a city with at
least 80% blue sky days in a calendar year (among other criteria) qualified for the
“national environmental protection model city” award. This API cutoff for a
model city increased further to 85% in 2007. While these incentive policies were
adopted to reduce air pollution, they also provided incentives to game the API
data, as the API data are reported by local governments and misreporting is less
costly than actual improvement of air quality.
Using the officially reported API data from 37 large cities during 20002009, we show that there is a significant discontinuity at the threshold of 100,
despite the fact that API is calculated as a city-day average for multiple pollutants
across multiple monitoring stations. This discontinuity is of a greater magnitude
after 2003, and model cities are less likely to report API right above 100 when
they face more pressure to reach the cutoff by the end of the year in which and the
year before they won the award. That being said, we also find significant and
stable correlation between the API with two alternative measures of air pollution:
visibility (reported by the China Meteorological Administration, CMA) and
Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) derived from the NASA satellites. These findings
suggest that the count of blue sky days may be subject to data manipulation, but
the reported API does contain useful information about air pollution.
We also show that, controlling for weather, day fixed effects, and cityspecific factors, there is no statistically significant improvement in the API,
visibility, or the AOD immediately before or after a city won the model city
award. This implies that model city status is not awarded to acknowledge
significant air quality improvement within a city, which could be explained by
either the model city policy providing little incentive to improve air quality or the
policy encouraging every city to improve on similar scales regardless of model
city award status. Both are consistent with the fact that air quality is only a small
part of model city award evaluation and the model city award is only one of many
incentive tools facing local governments.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes data and
policies on blue sky days and model city evaluation. Section 3 reviews the
literature. Section 4 presents evidence of the discontinuity of the API, the
particulate matter inferred from the API (PM10), visibility, and the AOD. Section 5

examines the extent to which the pressure to achieve the model-city goal of blue
sky days has affected the reported API and PM10. Section 6 offers a broader study
of whether various measures of air quality have improved immediately before or
after a city won the model city award. Section 7 checks the correlations between
the API, visibility, and AOD in light of the API discontinuity around the blue sky
threshold. Section 8 concludes.
2 Data and Background
China has been known for poor air quality since the 1990s. The 1996
national standards on sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), total
suspended particles (TSP), and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter
of 10 microns or smaller (PM10) were 2-7 times higher than the standards
established by the World Health Organization (UNEP 2009). An amendment in
2000 further weakened the Chinese standards for NO2 and ozone. Even so, the
relatively liberal standards are hard to enforce in China, partly because each local
environment protection agency, although a branch of the Ministry of
Environmental Protection (MEP), is also part of the local government and thus
subject to local governance.
2.1 API
Among other environmental protection efforts, the MEP started publishing
a daily air pollution index (API) for 86 cities in June 2000. These cities cover
most median- and large-size cities of China, including all the provincial-level
municipalities and all provincial capitals. For each city, the MEP aggregates the
measured intensities of NO2, SO2, and PM10 (monitored at sparsely distributed
stations with unknown locations in the city) into a daily API ranging from 0 to
500.6 Specifically, suppose a city has M stations and each station monitors NO2,
SO2, and PM10 N times each day.7 The MEP first computes the daily average of
all the MxN measures for each pollutant and then translates the daily mean
intensity into a pollutant-specific API according to linear spines with cutoff points
as defined in Table 1.8 The overall API is the maximum of all pollutant-specific
6

According to Andrews (2008) and Jiang et al. (2004), API was calculated based on TSP, NO2,
SO2, in 1998-2000. A new policy starting in June 2000 changed API calculation to PM10, NO2, and
SO2. MEP monitors the intensity of CO but does not include it in the current API calculation
because the calculation formula was set ten years ago and at that time the vehicle volume in China
was very low. MEP is considering adding CO and other pollutants for future API. Source:
http://news.163.com/09/0312/11/5470SBA9000120GU.html
7
The MEP stipulates the number of monitoring stations according to city population and the size
of the established area. For a large city like Beijing, one monitoring station is required for every
25-30 km2 and the total number of stations must be at least 8.
8
For example, if the daily mean of PM10 is 220 μg/m3, the corresponding API of PM10 is (220150)/(350-150)*(200-100)+100 = 135.

APIs. If that maximum is above 500, the overall API is capped at 500. The MEP
partitions the API into five groups: 0-50, 51-100, 101-200, 201-300, and 301-500,
representing “excellent,” “good,” “slightly polluted,” “moderately polluted,” and
“heavily polluted” air quality, respectively. The MEP also reports the category of
the dominant pollutant(s) if the API is above 50. Over our analysis sample (from
06/06/2000 to 10/31/2009 for 37 cities), 72.9% of API observations reported PM10
as the main pollutant, 0.35% reported NO2, and 6.85% reported SO2. The
remaining 19.9% have an API below 50.

from Table 2.2 of UNEP (2009).

Although the API data are disclosed on the MEP website, they are
collected and reported by local MEP branches. At the frequency of city-day, it is
virtually impossible for the central MEP to verify every number reported by a
local branch. To the extent that local MEP officials are subject to local
governance, the reliability of the API data may depend on the data collection
method (defined by the MEP), as well as local political incentive to report a good
number to the central government.

2.2 Blue Sky Day
A crude categorization of air pollution refers to a day with an API at or
below 100 as a “blue sky” day. Both national and local environmental authorities
have used the number of blue sky days in a year as a measure of air pollution. For
example, Beijing claims steady air quality improvement because the number of
blue sky days increased from 274 in 20089 to 285 in 200910and 286 in 2010.11
However, in our analysis sample, the average API of all blue sky days increased
from 65.62 in 2008 to 71.11 in 2009 (up to 10/31/2009). This finding implies that
continuous API and binary count of blue sky days can paint different pictures of
air quality. Nevertheless, the number of blue sky days is visible in mass media and
its improvement is often cited by local governments as a political goal at the
beginning of a calendar year and an achievement at the end of the year.12 The
phrase “blue sky day” has also been challenged by a local resident of Beijing,
who photographed the sky each day and found that the number of days with a real
blue sky was 180 instead of 285 in 2009.13 While the naked eye and reported data
differ in definition, this incident reflects the public attention paid to blue sky days.
2.3 Model city policy
As early as 1997, the central government of China started to evaluate
whether a city was qualified for a “national environmental protection model city”
award based on environmental quality and economic measures. These measures
cover air pollution, water quality, noise, percent of green land, management of
industrial and residential waste, consumer satisfaction with the environment,
municipal institutions that focus on environmental protection, GDP per capita,
GDP growth rate, population growth rate, energy consumption, and water
consumption.14 While the API has always been the only measure of air quality in
the evaluation criteria, its use in model city evaluation is vague. The ambiguity
was reduced over time, as a 2003 regulation specified that a model city must have

over 80% of days in a calendar year with an API below 100 and this cutoff was
increased to 85% in 2007.15
It is worth noting that participation in the model city evaluation is
voluntary. We do not observe which cities applied for the award in a given year,
and we assume that every city that satisfies the explicit criteria apply. Upon
application, the central government’s evaluation committee will visit the city in
person and announce the winner(s) afterwards.16 Among the 37 big cities for
which we have complete API and visibility data from 6/5/2000 to 10/31/2009,
nine have won the model city award in our sample period: Qingdao (2000),
Hangzhou (2001), Changchun (2002), Nanjing (2003), Fuzhou (2004), Shenyang
(2004), Nantong (2006), Tianjin (2006) and Guangzhou (2007). Another six cities
won the award before the start of our sample: Shenzhen (1997), Dalian (1997),
Xiamen (1997), Haikou (1999), Shantou (1999) and Suzhou (1999). Because we
do not know the exact timing of award announcement, we assume that the
evaluation is conducted based on the data for the year of award and one year
before the award.17
The model city award is semi-permanent. According to the MEP
regulation, a city that has won the model city award is subject to reexamination
every three years; if it fails the reexamination, it has two years to correct the
problem; if underperformance remains after the correction period, the award will
be revoked. In reality, some reexaminations were conducted more than three years
after the initial award, and some cities were even exempted from reexamination.18
To our best knowledge, no model city award has ever been revoked. This suggests
that it is more difficult to earn a model city award than it is to keep it. It may also
15

The 1997 regulation was a pilot program that specified the criterion of air quality as
“API<100.” The 2003 regulation clarified the air quality criterion as the percentage of days with
API<100 higher than 80%. The regulation was issued on 11/19/2002 and made effective on
7/1/2003 (http://www.mep.gov.cn/gkml/zj/bgt/200910/t20091022_173806.htm). The 2007
regulation (effective as of 1/1/2007) stipulated that the percentage of days of API<=100 be higher
than 85%. Although the 1997 and 2003 regulations specified API<100 instead of API<=100, we
believe the actual implementation was always API<=100 because both definitions of blue sky days
and the “good” API category use 100 as the upper bound. This assumption is also confirmed in the
below discontinuity study and a local MEP branch website in Xiamen.
16
We could not find any MEP document that provides details on the specific timing of the model
city award.
17
In one particular application, we observe the applicant citing environmental and economic
measures in the past two years.
18
For example, Yangzhou earned the award in 2002 but was re-examined in 2006
(http://www.mep.gov.cn/gkml/zj/bgth/200910/t20091022_174312.htm); Changchun earned the
award in 2002, but was re-examined in 2008
(http://www.mep.gov.cn/gkml/zj/bgth/200910/t20091022_174443.htm). According
to http://wfs.mep.gov.cn/mfcs/mfcsxx/gldt/200503/t20050327_65797.htm, some model cities can
be exempted from re-examination.

reduce incentives for both manipulation and genuine improvements in air quality
after winning the model city award, a hypothesis we will examine in Section 6.

2.4 Visibility
In addition to the API, we employ two additional proxies for air pollution.
The first proxy is visibility, defined as the greatest distance at which an observer
with normal eyesight can discern a dark object from the horizontal sky. We
obtained daily visibility data from the China Meteorological Administration
(CMA), along with local temperature, precipitation, barometric pressure,
sunshine, humidity, and wind velocity as reported at 2PM each day at a fixed point
in each city. Researchers have shown that API and visibility are negatively
correlated (Che et al. 2006, Fan and Li 2008), and visibility is considered to be an
important predictor of fine particulates (Ozkaynak et al. 1985, Huang et al.
2009).19 Like the API, visibility is reported by government officials, but it is not
disclosed to the public (we purchased the data from CMA) and not used in the
evaluation of government officials, and therefore is subject to fewer gaming
incentives.
2.5 AOD
The second proxy for air pollution is the daily 10km AOD data (Level 2,
collection 5.0) retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) aboard Terra and Aqua satellites (NASA 2010). The extraction
procedure is available elsewhere (Chu et al. 2003; Levy et al. 2007a, 2007b).
Imagine that radiation travels from a satellite to the earth’s surface. By definition,
the AOD captures the amount of radiation absorbed, reflected, and scattered due
to the presence of solid and liquid particulates suspended in the atmospheric
column (Kaufman, Gobron et al. 2002; Kaufman, Tanre et al. 2002). While the
AOD is potentially available everywhere at the satellite crossing time (~10:30am
and ~1:30pm of Beijing time), it is sensitive to the point- and time-specific
weather and available only for days with less than 10% cloud cover. Despite this
fact, researchers have shown that the AOD, corrected for meteorological
conditions, can predict air quality (Gupta et al. 2006; Kumar 2010; Kumar et al.
2011). Focusing on Delhi and Kanpur in India and Cleveland in the US, Kumar et
al. (2009; 2011) demonstrate how the AOD can be converted to PM10 estimates.
They develop an empirical relationship between in situ measurements of PM10 and
the AOD. They conclude that AOD captured 70% of the variations in the PM10
(monitored on the surface) after controlling for meteorological conditions and
19

Fine particulates (PM2.5) are defined as particulates less than 2.5µm in aerodynamic diameter.

seasonality. Since the in situ PM10 data were not available for Chinese cities
during our sample period, this paper utilizes the AOD data directly (corrected for
meteorological conditions and spatiotemporal structure).
The comparison of API, visibility, and AOD data is far from perfect. Even
if the reported dominant pollutant of the API is PM10, visibility and AOD data
could vary with the composition of particle size. According to Brook, Dann and
Burnett (1997), Canadian data suggest that PM2.5 accounted for 49% of the PM10,
and PM10 accounted for 44% of total suspended particles. The composition of
suspended particles is likely coarser in developing countries: Kumar and Foster
(2009) and Kumar, Chu and Foster (2007) show that PM2.5 accounts for only 24%
of the PM10 in Delhi, India. Moreover, all particulate matter in the atmosphere
could affect the AOD, whereas visibility and the API are more related to
particulate matter on the ground. The third difference is due to the mismatch in
the spatial resolution of AOD and API. Although we know the centroid latitude
and longitude of each AOD data point (which represents ~10km at the satellite
crossing path), we do not know the exact location of each API or visibility
monitoring station.20
2.6 Analysis Sample
Conditional on having non-break API and visibility data, our analysis
consists of 37 cities, which include major provincial-level municipalities, such as
Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing, as well as 24 provincial capitals.21
The API, visibility, and other meteorological data from the CMA are
reported by city-day, covering 126,688 observations from 6/5/2000 to 10/31/2009.
For the 37 cities in our sample, we retrieved 2,614,734 valid 10km AOD
observations from 2/25/2000 to 12/31/2009. Of all the 3,598 calendar days in the
sample period, only 49.9% had valid AOD observations due to gaps in the data.22
On average, we have 39.36 data points of the AOD per city-day.
To control for time-specific meteorological conditions at the observation
time of the AOD, we acquired hourly global surface meteorological data from the
monitoring stations in and around the selected cities. The details on these data are
20

Andrews (2008) and Viard and Fu (2011) used station-level PM10 data for Beijing. We are not
aware of station-level data available for all the 37 cities in our sample from 2000 to 2009.
21
Although the MEP reports API for 86 cities and the CMA visibility data cover 69 cities, only 42
cities have API data in 2000 and the visibility data are incomplete for some cities between 1993
and 2009. For an unknown reason, the API data are missing on June 4, 2008 for all cities. So the
“non-break” criterion means having valid data every city-day from the beginning to the end of our
data sample, ignoring the missing data on June 4, 2008. All the discontinuity analysis in Section 4
is robust on the full sample of 86-city API data.
22
For 37 cities from February 25, 2000 to December 31, 2009, there are totally 133126 city/day
cells. In our data, there are actually 66427 city/day cells with valid AOD observations, which
amounts to 49.9%.

10

available elsewhere (NCDC 2007). These data were collocated with the AOD data
within a one-hour time interval of AOD time on a given day. This means we
assigned the same value of meteorological conditions (from the closest station) to
all AOD values in a given city on a given day. The gaps in meteorological data
and AOD data resulted in missing values in 6% of the sample. Therefore,
meteorological conditions were imputed for days when AOD was available.23
To facilitate the comparison between API, visibility, and AOD data, our
AOD analysis focuses on the city-day average of the AOD conditional on AOD
availability. This resulted in 63,948 city-day observations of AOD, of which
50,672 city-days reported PM10 as the dominant pollutant.
3 Literature and potential ways to game the API
We are not the first to question the reliability of API data. Using data for
Beijing only, Andrews (2008) expresses concern that Beijing may have
manipulated the official API report because (1) Beijing has relocated monitoring
stations over time; (2) the 2000 MEP regulation switched one component of API
from TSP to PM10, and weakened the limits of nitrogen oxides and ozone; and (3)
the number of days with an API between 96 and 100 is significantly higher than
the number of days with an API between 101 and 105. The article compares
reported API with detailed station-level PM10 data, showing discontinuity of API
and PM10 data, but provides no formal statistical test for the discontinuity. Nor
does it control for weather and other factors that may influence API. Guinot
(2008) suggests that it is not uncommon to add monitoring stations with economic
and urban growth, and the uncertainty in the API metrics may range from 15% to
25% due to measurement errors in pollutant intensities. This casual debate
motivates us to examine the discontinuity of API in a more scientific way. Our
study also expands from Beijing to 37 big cities, and pays more attention to the
incentive of misreport from local governments.
A few other studies have used alternative measures of air pollution in
addition to the official API. In February 2009, United Nations published a
summary report on the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, with an entire chapter
devoted to air quality (UNEP 2009). This report uses the API and pollution
intensity data from the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB), plus a
brief discussion of coarse resolution AOD data (i.e., 100km instead of the10km
AOD used in our study). The report concludes that Beijing’s air quality improved
from before to during to shortly after the 2008 Games. Chen et al. (2011)
23

When meteorological variables are missing, we usually miss some but not all of them. Suppose
we only miss the meteorological variable K for date t in city c. Conditional on the days when K is
available, we regress K on the other meteorological variables and continuous time (days since
2000). We then impute K on date t, using these regression coefficients and other meteorological
variables that are available on date t.

11

investigate the impact of the 2008 Games on air quality using the same API and
AOD data as in this paper. After controlling for city-specific attributes and a
nationwide trend toward better air, they find that the air-cleaning actions adopted
in the name of the 2008 Olympic Games lead to real but temporary improvement
in the air quality of Beijing. This result is supported by both API and AOD data,
suggesting that the API contains useful information about air pollution. However,
this conclusion does not rule out gaming of the API given the imperfect
comparison between API and AOD data. Viard and Fu (2011) use both API and
station-level PM10 data of Beijing to investigate the impact of traffic restriction on
air quality. They find that traffic restriction leads to a 19% decline of API during
every-other-day restriction and a 7% decline during one-day-per-week restriction.
Wang et al. (2009) collected their own PM10 and PM2.5 data at Peking
University between 7/28/2008 and 10/7/2008. They find a significant correlation
between self-measured and published PM10, but the absolute level of their selfmeasure is 30% higher. This finding triggers concerns that the official API may be
subject to manipulation, but the discrepancy may be attributed to sampling and
methodological differences (Tang et al. 2009, Yao et al. 2009, Simorich
2009).Wang et al. (2009) also find that meteorological conditions such as wind,
precipitation, and humidity account for 40% of the total variation in PM10. This is
why we need daily meteorological data for every city in our sample.
Any systematic study of gaming needs to ask “why” and “how.” The
incentive to improve the reported API is rooted in the unique structure of the
Chinese political system. As described in Xu (2011), China is characterized by a
combination of political centralization and economic regional decentralization:
the central government controls the appointment, promotion, and demotion of
local political leaders, while leaving to subnational governments (provinces,
municipalities, and counties) the responsibility for initiating and coordinating
reforms, providing public services, and making and enforcing laws within their
jurisdictions. The central control of personnel is a powerful instrument to induce
regional officials to follow the central government’s policies. This so-called
regionally decentralized authoritarian (RDA) regime stands in clear distinction to
federalism (where governors or mayors are elected from the bottom) and central
planning.
Researchers have shown that the central government stipulates
performance criteria for local leaders, and these local leaders negotiate narrower
and more precisely defined performance contracts with its sub-levels. For
example, Tsui and Wang (2004) show that 60 percent of provincial leaders are
assigned targets related to economic construction. More generally, work
achievement accounts for 60 to 70 percent of the evaluation of regional officials,
while political integrity, competence, diligence, and other aspects account for the
rest (Edin 2003). Similar personnel control is documented between county

12

governments and township and village officials (Whiting 2000). Within this
structure, every level of government may use absolute and/or relative
performance in the political contract for the next level. Maskin, Qian and Xu
(2000) provide evidence that officials from relatively better-performing regions
have a greater chance of being promoted. Similarly, Chen, Li and Zhou (2005)
find that provincial officials’ performance relative to the national average and to
their immediate predecessors has significant impacts on their promotions. All this
evidence suggests that the central personnel control over the local governments is
effective and that the model city award policy is likely one of many performance
criteria that the central government uses to evaluate local officials.
For gaming of the API to exist, two conditions must hold. First, there
needs to be enough noise in the true API that one cannot precisely target a
particular number (e.g. the upper bound of blue sky days) via actual improvement.
This condition is not difficult to satisfy, given that meteorological conditions such
as wind, precipitation, and humidity account for 40% of the total variation in
PM10 (Wang et al. 2009).
The second necessary condition for gaming to exist is that it needs to be
difficult to detect. To the extent that the MEP uses the reported API without
verification, a local MEP branch could report any number, in theory. However, the
reported API will be disclosed to the public, and citizens (including local media)
will form their own judgment as to how precise the reported API is relative to
their personal experience on that city-day. The recent smog in Beijing
demonstrates the high public awareness of air quality and the power of public
outcry if the official API is not consistent with personal experience. 24 This
suggests that any misreporting cannot stray too far from the truth.
One way to game the system is reporting an API slightly above 100 as
slightly below 100. More sophisticated gaming may spread the underreporting if
the public cannot distinguish small changes in the API (say, 99 vs. 95). Data
manipulation can also be achieved by relocating monitoring stations or computing
the aggregated index from a selective sample of existing stations, both of which
are difficult to detect because the reported API is not station-specific and in situ
density of air pollutants was not publicly available in our sample period.25
As summarized in Zitzewitz (2012), “forensic economics” relies on
several techniques to detect gaming: one is to compare the reported data with
24

The heavy smog in Beijing on December 4-6, 2011 caused extensive flight delays and
cancellations. See BBC December 5, 2011 report “China morning round-up: Beijing heavy smog

Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center started to publish pollutant densities by
hour and monitoring stations on January 12, 2012. There are not enough historical data to study
the reliability of this measure.

13

other data sources. For example, Fisman and Wei (2004, 2007) and Mishra et al.
(2007) compare custom data in both origin and destination countries in order to
identify missing imports or missing exports. Zinman and Zitzewitz (2009)
compare resort-reported snowfall with official weather data and find that resorts
are more likely to over-report snowfalls when they can benefit more from such
over-reporting. Snyder and Zidar (2009) compare economists’ self-reported
publications (in vitas) with journals' tables of contents and identify subtle forms
of inflation. This method of collation is limited to the availability of other reliable
data sources.
A second method to detect gaming is searching for data patterns that are
consistent with gaming, for example, bunching around a threshold (Slemrod 1985
and Saez 2010 on income tax, DeGeorge, Patel and Zeckhauser 1999 on earnings
management, and Forbes, Lederman and Tombe 2011 on airline delays), patterns
that should not exist without cheating (Jacob and Levitt 2003 on school test
scores), or a correlation between the reported data and the situations that present
strong incentives to game (Michaely and Womack 1999 on stock
recommendations, Levitt and Syverson 2008 on real estate sales).
We use both methods. First, we detect discontinuity in the raw data around
critical thresholds. Given the clear threshold definition for blue sky days, we
expect API density to be lower immediately below 100 than immediately above
100 if gaming exists. Moreover, this discontinuity should be more conspicuous
after the central government introduces a quantitative measure of blue sky days in
the evaluation of a model city, if local governments care about winning the model
city award. With the specified cutoff (80% from 2003 to 2006 and 85% after
2007), we expect cities that are close to the cutoff in the fourth quarter of a year to
have an incentive to underreport the API at or below 100. Given the permanence
of the model city award, we also expect cities that have already won the model
city award to be less eager to game for the award.
Our second approach is to compare reported API with visibility and AOD
data. Given the imperfect comparison of the three air pollution proxies, we will
investigate their statistical correlations after controlling for other factors that may
correlate with them in different ways (e.g. weather). To the extent that the
underreporting of the API generates a random number below but close to 100, we
expect the correlation between the API and visibility/AOD to be lower when the
API is close to 100. However, if underreporting is monotonic to the actual API –
for example, report 105 as 100, 104 as 99, and 101 as 96 – gaming does not
necessarily predict a lower correlation between the API and visibility/AOD.

14

4 Tests of Discontinuity
This section examines the discontinuity among API, visibility, and AOD
data. To the extent that the API cannot be misreported too far from truth, we
expect misreporting to lead to less density on the right of 100 than on the left.
4.1 Discontinuity of API and underlying PM10
The first row of Figure 1 plots the histogram of the API in our whole
sample, where bins are defined over the complete API range (0 to 500) with bin
width=1 (API is reported in integers). The plot shows likely discontinuity at 50,
100, and 500: the number of observations jumps from 1,408 for 50 to 2,034 for
51, from 1,367 for 99 and 1,005 for 100 to 509 for 101, and from 2 for 499 to 126
for 500.
One possible explanation for this discontinuity is the API definition. As
shown in Table 1, the API is a piece-wise linear transformation from the averaged
in situ measures of the main pollutant on a city-day. As confirmed in simulation,
the API definition could generate API discontinuity around each category
threshold even if the underlying pollutant density is continuous. To assess this
possibility, we focus on the city-days that report PM10 as the main pollutant and
infer PM10 density from the reported API. Since the main pollutant is not specified
when the API is below 50, our analysis on PM10 focuses on the city-days with the
API above 50.
One data issue arises in this process. Because the API is reported in
integers and PM10 range (0 to 600) is greater than API range (0 to 500), inferred
PM10 has zero density for many PM10 numbers. As shown in the second row of
Figure 1, with bin width=1 we observe positive frequency on only 363 out of the
600 potential integers of PM10. To address this, we group PM10 by a wider bin
width of 2, as 2 is the transformation factor from the API to PM10 when the API is
below 200 and most of the API data are below 200.26
As shown in Figure 1, when bin width=1, PM10 demonstrates apparent
discontinuity around 150 (corresponding to API of 100). When bin width is
widened to 2, human eyes can still identify discontinuity around PM10=150.
The second column of Figure 1 presents the Burgstahler and Dichev test
(BDT) of discontinuity (Burgstahler and Dichev 1997). In particular, for any bin
(j) that is not at the boundaries, we compute a BDT statistics by comparing the

26

When API is between 50 and 100, PM10=50+(API-50)/(100-50)*(150-50)=50+(API-50)*2.
When API is between 100 and 200, PM10=150+(API-100)/(200-100)*(350-150)=150+(API100)*2. When API is between 200 and 300, PM10=350+(API-200)/(300-200)*(420350)=350+(API-200)*0.7. When API is between 300 and 400, PM10=420+(API-300)/(400300)*(500-420)=420+(API-300)*0.8. When API is between 400 and 500, PM10=500+(API400)/(500-400)*(600-500)=500+(API-400).

According to Burgstahler and Dichev (1997) and Takeuchi (2004),
conforms to a standard normal distribution if the true distribution underlying the
data is continuous. Obviously, the power of BDT depends on sample size and bin
width. Using Monte Carlo simulation, Takeuchi (2004) shows that the test is
powerful over moderate sample size (n>500) and is able to detect a small jump if
the sample size is large (n>5000). Our sample size is 126,688 for the API and
92,383 for PM10.27
The first graph in the second column of Figure 1 draws BDT against each
API value. The two dashed lines correspond to 2.58 and -2.58, the critical values
for the 99% confidence in a standard normal distribution. Consistent with the
histogram on the left, this BDT graph confirms significant API discontinuity in
the neighborhood of 50, 100, and 500. The large BDT at 499 is not surprising
given the censoring at 500. The significant BDTs around 50 can be driven by
gaming or the piece-wise definition of API. We cannot distinguish the two
because the major pollutant is not reported unless the API is greater than 50.
The other two graphs in the second column of Figure 1 present the BDT
for each bin of PM10. With bin width=1 the BDT graph confirms discontinuity at
many points (due to gaps in PM10 data), but the discontinuity for PM10=150 still
stands out. With bin width=2, the discontinuity at PM10=150 remains significant.
This suggests that the discontinuity of API at 100 is not completely driven by its
piece-wise definition.

27

One potential caveat of the BDT is that its value is proportional to the square root of sample size.
When sample size is very large (e.g. 2.6 million observations for our point-specific AOD data) and
the value of each raw data point is limited to a small number of decimal points, each computed
BDT can exceed the critical value even if the underlying distribution is continuous. This is partly
why we choose to focus on city-day average of the AOD rather than point-specific AOD. While
this choice may create some smoothness in the AOD, it is arguably a better comparison with the
API, not only because they are both at the city-day level but also because the API by construction
is an average of station- and time-specific data on a city-day.

Figure 2 presents the BDT statistics of API, PM10 (bin-width=1) and PM10
(bin-width=2) before and after 2003 separately. The discontinuity around
API=100 and PM10=150 is more significant after 2003, consistent with the
introduction of blue sky targets in 2003. An alternative explanation is that there
are more data after 2003, and the BDT increases with sample size by definition.
The BDT statistics use only bins adjacent to the study bin. A more general
test introduced by McCarry (2008) employs all the data to the left and right of a
potential break point and smoothes the histogram by running local linear
regressions on the two sides separately. If there is no discontinuity at the break
point, the two predicted densities at the break point should be close to each other.
This yields a discontinuity estimate (log difference in the two predicted densities
at the break point) and the corresponding standard error and t statistics.
Figure 3A presents the API histogram with smoothed densities to the left
and right of 100. Following McCarry (2008), we set bin size as 1 and bandwidth
as 15. Below Figure 3A, we report the discontinuity estimate, standard error, and
t-test for the full sample of the API and the subsamples of 2000-2002, 2003-2006,
2007-2009, model cities, and non-model cities. By model cities, we mean all the
1 observations of a city if that city won the model city award in year .
Within model cities, we further distinguish model cities in the years preparing for
and receiving the award (
1 & ) versus years after winning the award (
).
Not only does the McCarry test confirm the API discontinuity at 100; it
shows that the discontinuity estimate more than doubled from 2000-2002 to 20032006 and only declined slightly after 2007. Similarly, the discontinuity estimate
for model cities almost triples that of non-model cities. These patterns support the
argument that local governments have more incentives to underreport the API
since the central government began emphasizing the number of blue sky days in
model city evaluation. Note that within model cities, the discontinuity estimate is
similar in the years before and after winning the award.
Figure 3B repeats the exercise for inferred PM10. Given the data gaps in
PM10, we define the x-axis as PM10/2 and conduct the McCarry test with bin
size=1 and bandwidth=10. Both the graph and the discontinuity estimates show
significant discontinuity around PM10=150 after 2003, and such discontinuity is
more conspicuous for model cities. This pattern is consistent with gaming around
PM10=150 and thus API=100.
Is it possible that the API discontinuity around 100 is driven by local
governments targeting 100 in real air quality? If the answer is yes, to the extent
that visibility and the AOD are correlated with the API, we shall observe some
discontinuity for these two variables as well, especially in the days where the API
is not far from 100. Conversely, if the API discontinuity at 100 is driven by
gaming, visibility and the AOD should not demonstrate any discontinuity because
they are used in neither mass media nor model city evaluation.

Figures 4 and 5 present the BDT for visibility and the AOD. Contrary to
our expectation, visibility demonstrates significant discontinuity at integers,
especially multiples of five. This phenomenon is easy to explain because visibility
is based on human visual observation and manual reporting. The bottom two
panels of Figure 4 separate the BDT of visibility by ranges of API (0-40, 40-80,
80-120, 120-500). If the API discontinuity at 100 reflects real air quality and
visibility is a valid proxy of air quality, we may observe more discontinuity of
visibility when the API is between 80 and 120, as compared to other ranges of the
API. Figure 4 does not support this conjecture. As for the city-day average of the
AOD, Figure 5 shows no obvious discontinuity at any particular value, which is
further confirmed by ranges of the API.28 These patterns are consistent with the
lack of gaming incentives in the AOD data.
Above all, the observed API distribution reveals a significant discontinuity
at 100 and such discontinuity is not completely driven by the piece-wise
definition of the API. The distributions of the API and inferred PM10 are
consistent with gaming in response to the definition of blue sky days and the
model city policy.
5. Regression results on model city incentives
This section uses regressions to detect whether cities respond to the
targeted number of blue sky days in model city evaluation. Because the pressure
for city to manipulate the API of day
in year
depends on the target and
the previously achieved number of blue sky days, we define
#

.

#

For example, if a city realized 16 blue sky days in January 2003, then its pressure
on February 1 is (365*80%-16)/(365-32)=0.829. If February 1 is not a blue sky
day, then its pressure on February 2 is (365*80%-16)/(365-33)=0.831.
Several adjustments are necessary. First, Pressure is coded 0 before 2003,
because the blue sky day target was not effective until 2003. Second, if the
targeted number of blue sky days is achieved before the end of the year, then
Pressure is coded 0 after the achievement. Third, Pressure is coded 0 if the above
formula yields a value larger than 1, which implies that it is impossible to achieve
the
28

In unreported graphs, we plot the BDT against a fine grid of point-specific AOD. Probably due to
the very large sample size (2.6 million) and the limited decimal points in the AOD data, we have
the BDT exceeding the critical value everywhere and across all ranges of the API. Even if we take
the BDT values literally, it implies discontinuity everywhere, which is inconsistent with the
special discontinuity of API around 100.

target.29 Fourth, the above formula is not well defined for the last day of a
calendar year. We code Pressure 0 for the last day of year, because it should be
zero if the target has been realized before the last day. If the target has not been
met, there is no way to meet it unless the city is only one day short of the target,
which is rare in our data.30 Above all, two types of variations help identify the
effect of
: one is the comparison between the days when gaming could
help (
0) and the days when gaming is not necessary or unhelpful; the
other is different magnitudes of pressure conditional on
0.
To capture potential gaming incentives of model city, we define:
1 if city c is announced as a model city in year y;
1 if city c has been announced a model city before year y;
1 if city c is announced as a model city in year y 1.
Given the API discontinuity around 100, we want to understand whether
cities systematically underreport an above-100 API number as below 100. To the
extent that underreporting must be subtle to avoid public attention, we expect
gaming to lead to a lower probability to report right above 100 (defined as
between 101 and 105, inclusive) and a higher probability to report right below
100 (defined as between 96 and 100, inclusive). Alternatively, if model cities won
the award because of overall improvement in air quality, the whole API
distribution should shift to the left. Because the blue sky threshold is on the right
tail of the API distribution (Figure 1), real improvement should imply lower API
density in both [96,100] and [101,105].
At first glance, it seems straightforward to regress a dummy of whether
the
reported
API
falls
into
[96,100]
or
[101,105]
on
,
,
,
and their interactions for the full
sample. This regression is likely to generate bias because
is defined by
the API on previous days of the same year. Not only does this present a classical
econometrics problem with a lagged dependent variable on the right hand side; it
is also possible that local MEP branches (or city governments) engage in
sophisticated dynamic programming throughout the year in order to meet the
targeted number of blue sky days. Since officials are likely to know more than we
do about the benefits and costs of meeting the target, it is difficult for us to
capture this dynamic behavior in an explicit model.
29

Results change little if we add a separate dummy to control for the cases of “impossible to
reach the target.”
30
This happens only once in our data, for Yinchuan in 2003, and its last day API reading is 101 in
2003. This city did not win the model city award until 2011.

25

To address this problem, we focus on the last quarter of each year and take
as of September 30 as a predetermined variable. We run the
regression:
∙
0930
0930

0930
∙
∙

∙

where
is the dummies of 96
100, 101
105, 140
PM10 150, or 151 PM10 160. The choice of neighborhood range is
arbitrary, but we ran the same regressions by alternative ranges (+/-10, +/-8, +/-3
for the API and +/- 20, +/- 16, +/- 6 for PM10) and obtained similar results.31 are
city fixed effects,
are date fixed effects,
are city-specific time trends32,
and X are control variables including city-day weather 33 and socioeconomic
indicators such as GDP growth rate, GDP per capita, industrial production,
population, energy consumption, number of private vehicles, and a dummy for
regular heating season if heating is provided by the city.
Our main interest is the two-way interaction between
0930 and
the status of model city. If a city won the model city award by gaming the API,
gaming should be more apparent in the year of or the year immediately before the
award, and when it is subject to a greater pressure to reach the target. Errors are
clustered by city.
Linear probability34 results are reported in Table 2. The first two columns
focus on the API in the full sample; the last two columns focus on inferred PM10
when PM10 is the dominant pollutant. Coefficients on
0930 ∗
and
0930 ∗
suggest that the higher the pressure
to reach the target, the more likely it is for a city that is about to win the award to
report an API/PM10 right below the blue sky threshold. Similarly, the higher the
pressure, the less likely the city is to report an API/PM10 right above the threshold.
All these effects are relative to two or more years before winning the award. In
comparison, in the years after winning the award, neither API nor TSP regressions

31

The signs of key coefficients remain the same as before, but those in the smaller bands (+/-3 for
API and +/-6 for PM10) are less significant due to fewer data frequencies in the small bands.
32
In the reported table, we use a city-specific linear trend. Results are similar when we use a
quadratic or cubic trend instead.
33
Weather variables include rainfall, temperature, barometric pressure, sunshine, humidity (if
rainfall is zero), wind velocity, and four dummies for wind direction (east, south, west, and north).
34
We use a linear probability model because every regression includes a large number of date
fixed effects.

suggest significant changes in the neighborhood of the blue sky threshold. This
finding is consistent with the semi-permanent nature of the model city award.
The PM10 coefficients suggest that, compared to a city facing 10%
pressure, a city facing 60% pressure35 as of September 30 in the years of winning
the award is 6.2 percentage points more likely to report a PM10 right below the
blue sky threshold and 3.0 percentage points less likely to report a PM10 right
above the threshold. In the years immediately before winning the award, the
corresponding numbers are 2.7 percentage points36 more likely to report a PM10
right below the blue sky threshold and 2.2 percentage points less likely to report a
PM10 right above the threshold. These magnitudes are large compared to the
5.88% likelihood of observing a PM10 in [140,150] and 2.28% likelihood of
observing a PM10 in [151,160] in the raw data.
For robustness, we rerun the regressions using October 31 instead of
September 30 as the cutoff date. This makes the regression sample smaller.
Coefficients on the two-way interactions between
and model city
status are similar to those reported in Table 2, some with larger standard errors.
6. A broader evaluation of model city policy
Given the permanency of model city award and the evidence of gaming
API around 100, a remaining question is whether model city policies are effective
at motivating local governments to engage in an overall improvement of air
quality. Specifically, we have two predictions: first, if the model city award is
granted to acknowledge air quality improvement of a city, model cities should
have more air quality improvement right before winning the award than at least
two years before the award. Second, the lax re-examination policy implies that
model cities could reduce efforts to improve air quality after winning the award.
Tables 3A and 3B summarize the API and PM10 by city type and city status
in terms of model city award. In particular, we distinguish three city types: cities
that did not win any model city award by 2010 (total 22 cities), cities that won the
model city award in our sample period of 2000-2009 (total 9 cities), and cities that
won the award in or before 1999 (total 6 cities). For cities that won the award
during our sample period, we further distinguish their observations for at least 2
years before the award, 0-1 years before the award, and all years after the award.
As expected, cities that won the award earlier tend to have a lower average API,
lower PM10, and higher counts of blue sky days. Similarly, for the cities that won
the award during our sample, API and blue sky days improve over time.
Table 3A also shows that the probability of the API in [96,100] increases
during the award-winning years but decreases afterwards. Given the fact that the
35

Among 369 city-year observations, 135 have pressure0930=0. Conditional positive
pressure0930, the mean of pressure0930 is 0.54 and standard deviation is 0.20.
36
Of the four numbers, all but 2.7 are significant from zero with 95% confidence.

overall density of API declines in the range of 96 to 105, the non-monotonic
change is inconsistent with actual air quality improvement over time but
consistent with greater incentive to report the API in [96,100] right before
winning the award. In comparison, the probability of the API falling in [101,105]
declines both during and after the award winning years. This finding could be
consistent with gaming or actual improvement.
To test whether the model city award is granted to acknowledge air quality
improvement of a city or motivates model cities to reduce air quality protection
after receiving the award, we regress each air quality measure on the timing of
model city award while controlling for city fixed effects, date fixed effects,
weather, and socioeconomic indicators as specified above. Effectively, the default
control cities are those that do not win any model city award before the end of our
sample period. Compared with them, a city that won the award in our sample
should have better air quality right before winning the award and worse air quality
after winning the award if air quality improvement targets the model city award.
We define
1 if city c won the model city award in year y or y+1,
1 if city c won the model city award in or before year y-1,
and run regressions at the city-day level:

Table 4 shows that the air quality in model cities does not significantly
improve in the 0-1 years right before winning the model city award, nor does it
decrease after winning the award. This finding is consistent across the API, PM10,
visibility, the AOD and the dummy of blue sky. In light of the significant air
quality improvement found in Beijing around the 2008 Olympic Games (Chen et
al. 2011), we rerun the regressions without Beijing, without other Olympic-related
cities, and without data for 2008 and 2009. The results are similar.

7. Comparison of API/ PM10 with visibility and AOD
This section examines whether visibility and AOD are less correlated with
API when the API are reported to be close to 100. In particular, we define
1 if API is in [96,100],
1 if API is in [101,105],
and run the regressions:
∙

ln
∙
∙ ln

∙

∙ ln

∙

∙ ln
∙

;

ln

.

As before, control variables
include weather and socioeconomic
indicators. Errors are clustered by city. We present the regression results of
visibility in Table 5 and the AOD in Table 6. In both tables, the left panel is for the
API using the full sample; the right panel is for PM10 using the PM10 dominant
sample. In the PM10 regressions, Left and Right are adjusted according to whether
PM10 is in [140,150] or [151,160].
As expected, the API and PM10 are negatively correlated with visibility
and positively correlated with the AOD. In both tables, the coefficients of
ln
∙
and ln(
∙
are not significantly different from zero with
more than 95% confidence. ln
∙
is marginally significant in Table 5
(with a sign opposite to what we would expect under gaming), but its significance
disappears if the regression is run on the PM10 dominant sample only. This
suggests that the stronger correlation between visibility and the API when the API
is above 100 is probably driven by pollutants other than PM10.
Overall, these results are inconsistent with the gaming prediction that the
API and PM10 should be less correlated with visibility and with the AOD when
they are close to the blue sky day cutoff. However, these findings do not rule out
all types of gaming. It is possible that the extent of underreporting is not random
(e.g. shifting down the API by a constant). Even if underreporting is random, it
could go much further below the blue sky threshold. It is also possible that
visibility and the AOD are more related to fine particles than the API and PM10,
and this definitional difference dominates gaming underlying the API or PM10.

8. Conclusion
Overall, this paper focuses on two regulatory measures that China has
adopted to incentivize air quality improvement: publishing daily API for major
cities since 2000 and linking the count of blue sky days (
100) to the
evaluation of the model city award. Using daily API, visibility, and the AOD data
from 37 large cities during 2000-2009, we show that the officially reported API
has a significant discontinuity at the blue sky threshold. This discontinuity cannot
be fully explained by the piece-wise definition of the API and is more pronounced
after the introduction of the blue sky target in model city evaluation. These
patterns suggest data manipulation around the blue sky threshold.
That being said, we also find significant correlation of the API and two
alternative measures of air quality (visibility and the AOD), and such correlations
do not change significantly when the API is closely below or above 100. These
findings suggest that although count of blue sky days may be subject to data
manipulation, the reported API does contain useful information for cross-city and
cross-time variations of air pollution.
Evidence regarding the effect of the model city award is less clear. On the
one hand, reported API (and inferred PM10) around the blue sky threshold tends to
be more sensitive to the pressure of reaching the targeted blue sky days when a
city was winning the award, and this sensitivity declines after the city won the
award. This is consistent with gaming around the threshold. On the other hand,
based on all data, there is no statistically significant improvement in the API,
inferred PM10, visibility, or the AOD immediately before or after a city won the
model city award once we control for weather, city fixed effects, and date fixed
effects.
How then can these mixed findings be explained? We offer several
possible explanations. The first possibility is that the model city award does not
generate any significant air quality improvement throughout the year but it
generates incentives to game around the blue sky threshold when a city faces
higher pressure to reach the target toward the end of a year. If we rank cities
according to their average API in year 2001 only and then correlate this rank with
the order of receiving the model city award, we find the spearman rank correlation
to be 0.42 (significant at 99% confidence). This leads us to wonder whether the
model city award was designed simply to recognize cross-sectional variation of
air quality across cities rather than to encourage further environmental protection
efforts within a city.
It is also possible that local cities adopt real measures to temporarily
improve air quality around the threshold of blue sky days at the time of winning
the model city award. However, the reported API is supposed to be an average
across multiple stations and multiples times for a major pollutant on a city-day. It

36

is difficult to aim for a particular integer after such an arithmetic aggregation.
Also, the translation from city-wide anti-pollution measures to pollutant density is
noisy, not immediate, and difficult to predict beforehand. Some temporary
improvements — for example, relocating a monitoring instrument to a cleaner
area — are gaming, by our definition.
The third possibility is that gaming around the blue sky threshold is
dominated by overall air quality changes before, during, and after a city wins the
model city award. If every city improves in response to the model city policy
regardless of its award-winning status, such improvement contributes to national
variation. This could explain why we do not find any statistical improvement after
controlling for date fixed effects nationwide. But this explanation is questionable
if we consider how lax re-examination is after a city wins the model city award.
Other facts to be considered are that air quality is only one of the many statistics
used in model city evaluation and that model city evaluation is only one of the
many tools that the central government may use to promote local government
leaders. These considerations imply that cities could have improved air quality in
response to other policies that provide stronger and more continuous incentives
than the model city award. Identifying such policies is a potential direction for
future research.
