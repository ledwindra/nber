Accounting for Post-Crisis Inflation and Employment: A Retro Analysis

NBER Working Paper No. 20707
November 2014
JEL No. E31,E32,E52
ABSTRACT
What accounts for inflation after 2008? We use the prominent pre-crisis Smets-Wouters (2007) model
to address this question. We find that due to price markup shocks alone inflation would have been
1% higher than observed and 0.5% higher that the long-run average. Their standard deviation is similar
to its pre-crisis level. Price markup shocks were also responsible for the slow recovery of employment,
though not for the initial drop. Monetary policy shocks predict an inflation rate 0.5% below average.
Government expenditure innovations do not contribute much either to inflation or to employment
dynamics.

Introduction

Retro (adj.) Esp. of fashion, music, or design: characterized by imitation
or revival of a style from the (relatively recent) past; (more generally)
backward-looking, nostalgic, esp. affectedly so. Oxford English Dictionary

Why was there no deflation and what accounts for inflation after 2008?
This is the question we seek to address in our paper. There is a time-honored
tradition in economics to construct new models in light of new events, discarding previously successful approaches. This is particularly so in light of
the 2008 financial crisis. Much has been written about the failures of the
pre-crisis models to incorporate financial frictions and much has happened
in the literature since then. While we applaud (and participate) in these
ongoing efforts, there also is the risk of overfitting. For that reason, it may
be good to take pause once in a while and use a prominent pre-crisis model
to study a prominent post-crisis question. Let us call this a “retro analysis”.
This is what we do in this paper.
We examine the evolution of post-crisis inflation which has puzzled many
observers. As a subsidiary question, we examine the evolution of employment and seek to understand how it is related to the evolution of inflation:
these two are usually thought to be connected, via Phillips curve reasoning.
Inflation behavior has been on the minds of many. A number of academic
researchers have raised the issue of the connection between monetary policy, fiscal policy and aggregate economic conditions, and whether or not we
should expect inflation to be higher or lower than currently observed. Indeed, the fear of deflation was not merely an academic concern. At the end

of 2008, the financial markets were expecting a drop in inflation by 6%.1
Despite these widespread concerns, prices did not decrease. The absence
of deflation has been interpreted as a failure of the Phillips curve and the
theories linking economic slackness to deflationary pressure, but also as a
serious challenge to New Keynesian theories, linking the stimulus effects
of government spending to producing future inflation and thereby lower
unemploymentIn his Presidential Address, Hall (2011) argues that “the
inflation rate hardly responded to conditions in product and labor markets,
else deflation might have occurred”, concluding that theories based on the
concept of non-accelerating NAIRU fail to explain the dynamics of inflation
during the recent crisis.
Many attempts have been made to reconcile the theory with the observed
fact.2

Del Negro Marco and Frank (2014) add a financial wedge to the

Smets-Wouters model and argue that at the end of 2008 the missing deflation
was due to high expected future marginal costs.

Christiano, Eichenbaum

and Trabandt (2014) examine the evolution of output featuring a detailed
labor market. Complementary to these contributions, we instead proceed by
accounting for the post-crisis movements in inflation and employment, using
a benchmark DSGE model. To do so, we shall use the well-known pre-crisis
Smets-Wouters (2007) model and decompose the movements in inflation
and employment. One can read this as an exercise in “wedge accounting”
in the spirit of Chari, McGrattan and Kehoe (2007) , except that we are

Matthias Fleckenstein and Lustig (2013)
In his discussion to Ball and Mazumber (2011) ’s paper, Stock argues that the
missing deflation puzzle disappears when we consider PCE-XFE, headline CPI, headline
PCE and median CPI inflation. By contrast, Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2013) argue
that the missing deflation puzzle can be explained by a rise in inflation expectations.
Building on the fiscal theory of the price level,3 Leeper (2013) suggest that the expansion
of government debt may have led to higher inflation.

using the Smets-Wouters (2007) model as our measuring stick. We shall
use pre-crisis estimation and solution techniques too. In particular, we will
pretend that agents are unaware that the nominal rate cannot sink below
zero and may therefore be continuously surprised by positive shocks to the
policy rate, when the rate is zero rather than what the Taylor rule in this
model would have predicted. How far do we get by employing this “retro”
model rather than imposing recent advances (and there are many, pulling
in different directions)? The choice fell on Smets-Wouters (2007) because it
is one of the most successful and tested pre-crisis models.
Through the lenses of this model we can ask a number of questions. For
example, are there odd shocks that this model needs to impose in order to
explain the observed movements in inflation, that would point to a major
deficit in employing this model? What is the “smoking gun” and the telltale sign that this model is wrong to begin with? Are different types of
shocks dominant post 2007? Is the behavior of inflation and employment or
is their relationship after 2007 unusual, compared to what we have learned
from the rest of the sample? Answers to these questions may be useful in
judging how far a theory update may need to go in order to correct previous
deficiencies, or where to look more closely.
Our exercise delivers several interesting insights. First, the long lasting
period of low employment combined with stable and positive inflation that
characterized the years following the Great Recession raised further questions on the nature of the relation described by the Phillips curve and the
responsiveness of inflation to the slackness in the economy.

Hall (2011)

collects some evidence of the presence of demand shocks preventing the
economy from reaching full employment, concluding that the lack of defla-

tionary pressure suggests that inflation was near-exogenous. Smets-Wouters
provides a different answer: inflation hardly responded to the large and
positive employment gap because of price markup shocks counteracting the
deflationary pressure.
Secondly, we find that fluctuations in inflation are almost entirely driven
by wage and price markup shocks before the crisis but not after. As a
matter of fact, these shocks explain the bulk of the inflation dynamics in
pretty much the entire pre-crisis sample, from 1948 to 2007. By contrast, a
substantial gap between actual inflation and inflation explained by markup
shocks arises after 2007: based on the price markup shocks alone, inflation
should have been more than one percent higher. After 2007, inflation became
more responsive to monetary shocks, to shocks to TFP, to the risk premium
and to the investment-specific technology, that account almost in equal part
for the gap between inflation explained by the markup shocks and observed
data.
Moreover, government expenditure shocks hardly played any role. Neither
inflation nor employment are significantly explained by shocks to government expenditure. Although we acknowledge that the model has important
weaknesses as far as fiscal policy questions are concerned, we view our result indicative of the failure of the theories linking the stimulus effects of
government spending to producing future inflation and thereby lower unemployment.4 Likewise, the modest effect of government spending on employment without a corresponding effect on inflation is broadly consistent
with the view of Conley and Dupor (2013) , that the ARRA was largely a
government jobs program.5

For alternative papers discussing the role of the government stimulus during the

Obviously and given recent advances in the literature, the model presents
many limitations for the analysis of the post-crisis period. We model monetary policy and the impact of the zero lower bound as pseudo6 monetary
policy shocks, rather than explicitly introducing this constraint.

7

Moreover,

the model is unsuitable to address questions on the effect of the quantitative easing and the government stimuli during the period. It is also an issue
whether a solution method based on an approximation around a steady state
appropriately applies to the large disruption brought by the last crisis: we
have to go back almost 80 years to find something comparable. On the contrary, financial frictions are incorporated in the model to the extent to which
they introduce a wedge between the interest rate set by the central bank
and the return on assets held by the households. Similarly, the investmentspecific technology shocks capture exogenous changes in the efficiency of the
investment in capital.
In section II, we describe our approach. Section III, shows the results
for inflation and employment for the entire sample from 1948 to 2014. In
section IV, we “zoom in” on the crisis and post-crisis episode, starting in
2007 and provide some counterfactuals. Section VII offers some discussion
and conclusion.
II.

Our approach

The Smets-Wouters (2007) model assumes a representative household,
whose utility function is nonseparable in consumption and leisure, and where

, Kaplan and Violante (2014) , Wilson (2012) among the others.
6
We shall leave out the moniker “pseudo” for the remainder of the paper.
7
The zero lower bound is a key focus in, say, Eggertsson (2006) , Werning (2011)
or Eggertsson and Woodford (2005) .

consumption is compared to an external habit. Households can save by investing in capital or by buying government bonds. In addition, households
choose the level of capital and of capital utilization. Investment in capital is
costly. Labor unions and firms set respectively wages and prices according
to a Calvo pricing mechanism. Both wages and prices are partially indexed
to inflation. Finally, the interest rate is set according to a Taylor rule with
weights on both inflation and output gap and the government expenditure
is assumed to be exogenous.8
There are seven shocks in the model: shocks to the technological process, to the consumer’s preferences, to the government expenditure, to the
investment-specific technology, a price and a wage markup disturbance and
a monetary policy shock. The assumptions of the model and the choice of
the shocks restrict the set of possible explanations for the observed movements of the variables. Although with many limitations, the structure of
the model provides us with a fairly flexible structure. First, in spite of the
fact that financial frictions are not explicitly modeled, the shock in the Euler equation is a reduced form for all the sources of financial friction that
distort the intertemporal choices.9 Moreover, frictions that modify firms’
behavior are captured by the shocks to the price markup if they affect the
firms’ price setting choices. Furthermore, the interpretation of the shocks
to the investment-specific technology as financial frictions is an intriguing
possibility.
We solve and re-estimate the model using Dynare and a sample for the
period 1948Q1-2014Q2, rather than ending in 2004Q4, as in their paper.
8
Further details can be found in Smets and Wouters (2007) as well as in the technical
appendix to this paper.
9
See Drautzburg and Uhlig (2011) for instance.

Otherwise, we use the same Bayesian approach and prior as well as the
same (extended) time series as in Smets and Wouters (2007) , i.e. the
seven US time series on the log difference of real GDP, real consumption, real
investment, the real wage, log hours worked , the log difference of the GDP
deflator and the federal funds rate. While some differences in the estimates
arise, none are particularly remarkable. Details are in the appendix.
Next, we use the estimated model to calculate a (Wold) shock decomposition. This is a standard method in the literature, see Fernandez-Villaverde
et al. (2007) , and a brief reminder shall suffice. After log-linearization,
the model can be written as a system of linear equations. Given the seven
observables and an initial condition, we can solve for the time series of the
seven shocks. With this, we can now decompose the movements of inflation
and employment into the sequence of present and past shocks.
The decomposition also affords us to calculate a variance decomposition
for the variances of the four-quarter-ahead forecast error as well as the unconditional variance (or infinite-horizon forecast error10 ). We compute them
at the posterior mean for the coefficient matrices and the posterior mean
for the shock variances. To compare the contributions of the shocks across
subsamples, we use the estimated variances for ut for these subsamples as
well.

Accounting for inflation: full sample

Figures 1 and 2 report the historical decomposition of inflation into individual shocks. In each panel, we compare observed inflation (solid blue line)
and the inflation we would have observed if only one shock was non zero

for the whole period of time (dashed red line). The dashed red line close to
the horizontal axis reveals that the corresponding shock plays little role in
explaining the inflation dynamics.
A number of conclusions can be drawn from this analysis. The contribution of the monetary shocks over the entire sample period is important but
small. There is a bit of a positive push from monetary policy shocks in the
late 70’s, followed by a negative push in the early 80’s, in line with the standard narrative of fairly loose monetary policy during the 70’s, followed by
the Volcker disinflation. There also is a bit of a negative push at the end, after 2007, probably due to the zero lower bound constraint. We shall discuss
this more below, but what should be noted here is that these movements
are not unusual by full-sample standards. Assuming constant parameters
for the Taylor rule over the entire time period ranging from 1948 to 2014,
we fail to account for these changes in the monetary policy. However, it is
surprising that the model does not explain the oscillations in inflation during the periods in which there is some evidence of a change in the monetary
policy as the result of shocks to the monetary policy, but rather as shocks
to the price and the wage markup.
Second, shocks to TFP, to the risk premium, to the investment-specific
technology and to government expenditure had a remarkably negligible effect on inflation. The corresponding panels reveal that, were these shocks
absent, inflation would have remained almost stable and close to its longtrend average throughout the entire time period considered.
Third and by contrast, the shocks to the wage and the price markups are
particularly important to account for inflation dynamics: when combined
as in Figure (3), the two shocks explain the great majority of the observed

variation in inflation in the sample.11 Visually, that graph tells the story
that not much would have been missed in thinking about inflation, if one
had only concentrated on these two shocks alone. Also the importance
of wage and price markup shocks to account for the inflation dynamics is
confirmed by the variance decomposition: combined, the two shocks account
for 80.97% of the variance of inflation at one-year horizon and for 77.64% of
its asymptotic variance in the full sample (see first column of Tables 1 and
2).12
The overwhelming importance of the shocks to price and wage markup
hints at a general failure of the model to explain the inflation dynamics. Our
finding is related to a number of other studies on the issue. It corroborates
King and Watson (2012) ’s result, who show that inflation dynamics can
be decomposed in a part due to changes in the marginal cost and another
due to changes in inflation expectations and find that inflation expectations
are the most important component. Based on a similar result, Hall (2011)
and Michaillat and Saez (2014) postulate that the inflation rate follows
an exogenous path. However, it has also been argued that the fact the lack
of sensitivity of the inflation to the economic slackness could be a proof of
the success of the central bank to implement a stabilizing monetary policy.
Following this line of reasoning, inflation was stable during the 90’s because
the central bank successfully stabilized it, whereas it was high during the
70’s because the monetary policy was too lax.
11
Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2014) argue that markup shocks do not matter
for output fluctuations once risk shocks are introduced. Our focus is on inflation instead.
12
The tables report the variance decomposition for the entire period (left column), the
pre-crisis period (center column) and the post-crisis period (right column). The measures
in the three samples only differ for the variance of the shocks, restricted to the sample
period considered in each column. The Wold coefficients instead are the same throughout
the three columns and they are computed as previously explained using the full sample.

There is one glaring discrepancy, however, and that is the crisis and postcrisis episode of 2007 and beyond.

Accounting for inflation after 2008

After 2008, price markups exert a positive pressure on inflation. Therefore, this answers a key question of this paper: there was no deflation and,

inflation and the contribution of price and wage markup shocks. This gap
is primarily driven by the price markup shocks, that by themselves would
have predicted an inflation rate 1% higher than observed (and even 0.5%
higher than its long-run average), but while inflation was almost entirely
explained by price and wage markup shocks prior to the crisis of 2008, inflation responded more to the other shocks after 2008, contrary to the common

in a negative direction. Confirming the results from the full sample, the
contribution from government spending shocks is negligible even after 2008.
By contrast, shocks to TFP, to the risk premium and to the investmentspecific technology are more relevant. Moreover, monetary shocks now play
a fairly substantial role.
Presumably, monetary shocks capture the effect of the zero lower bound
on inflation. The model is log-linearized and it does not incorporate any
constraint on the monetary rule, effectively assuming that the central bank
can lower the nominal rate below zero: when observations of zero nominal

rates come in, the agents in the model treat these as a surprising tightening.
It should therefore not surprise, that these pseudo-shocks to monetary policy
had the effect of reducing inflation.14
Interestingly, one obtains an even smaller role of monetary policy shocks
when examining a variance decomposition (tables 1 and 2).15 According to
these tables, the contribution of monetary policy shocks was practically negligible: remarkably, this is also true for the post-2007 sample, in contrast
to the insights from figure 4 or table 3. Unsurprisingly, during the zero
lower bound episode from 2008 to 2010, monetary policy shocks tend to be
positive, all pointing in the direction of a surprise tightening. While the
standard deviation of these shocks is not remarkable in historical compari14

Although, below we show that treating the ZLB as a sequence of unexpected events
underestimate the effect of the liquidity trap on inflation.
15
To calculate the variance decomposition for the post-2007 episode and to compare
it to the full sample, we estimated the variance of the shocks for the post-2007 episode as
well as for the full sample, see table 4, and then proceeded to calculate a 4-step ahead and
a 200-step ahead variance decomposition in the usual manner, effectively assuming that
these variances then stay constant. Moreover, this procedure relies on the assumption
that the coefficients of the policy functions are constant throughout the whole period.

son, their effects pile up due to being virtually all of the same sign. For that
reason, figure 4 and table 3 provide better insight into the actual evolution
of inflation than the variance decompositions in tables 1 and 2. Nonetheless,
they show that perhaps these zero lower bound monetary policy shocks do
not amount to much.
A word of caution is due. The Wold decomposition, by construction,
represents a variable as the sum of the contribution of the shocks introduced
in the model. As such, it identifies what shocks would justify the observed
pattern in inflation and employment. Equivalently, by construction the

sum of the contributions of the shocks entirely explain the movements in
inflation. Therefore, the absence of response of inflation will be mechanically
interpreted as a combination of offsetting shocks, because a Phillips curve
is embedded in the model. So, it is not surprising that the model provides
an answer to the missing deflation puzzle. The relevant question is: can one
believe its answer? Are the shocks reasonable? Is the behavior of the shocks
estimated by the model significantly different from the previous period? Is

there any narrative evidence that can rationalize the shocks estimated by
the model?
We first look at the statistical properties of the shocks before and after
the Great Recession and conclude that there are no remarkable differences
between the two periods. Table 4 compares the standard deviation of the
shocks in the sample periods considered. It is even surprising to notice that
the standard deviation of the shocks is extremely similar before and after

by 20%. On the contrary and remarkably, shocks to government expenditure and to the risk premium are less volatile in the period following the
recession than in the period before: the standard deviation for the government expenditure shocks is 0.66 for the period before 2008 and 0.44 after,
whereas the standard deviation of the risk premium shocks is 0.12 for the
period before 2008 and 0.08 after. Instead, the shocks to the wage markup

period before. However, as we mentioned earlier, wage markup shocks do
not play a major positive pressure on the inflation in the post-crisis period.
Therefore, although their statistical properties differ somewhat in the two
periods, they are not the key driving force that is pushing inflation higher
than we would have expected. Figure 8 plots the time series of the shocks
to price and wage markup and it confirms that, although the price markup
shocks do not seem to display a different pattern before and after 2008, wage
markup shocks are more volatile.
There is good evidence in the literature on the sources of the shocks to the
monetary policy, to the risk premium, to the investment-specific technology
and to the government expenditure, responsible for a downward pressure on
inflation (see Hall (2011) for a discussion on the issue). On the other hand,
there is less anecdotal evidence on the increase in price markup that could
justify the shocks estimated by the model for the period of the financial crisis

and its aftermath. There is a large literature on the countercyclicality of
price markups due to strategic complementarities (see Atkeson and Burstein
(2008) among others), round-about production structure ( Basu (1995) )
or a demand featuring non-constant elasticity of substitution ( Klenow and
Willis (2006) ). We view this literature as broadly consistent with our results
and a complement to the more recent literature.

The zero lower bound resulted in a tightening monetary policy from 2008
to 2010, pushing inflation down. It should be noted, however, that the magnitude of this effect is rather modest. The model predicts that the inflation
drop due to the liquidity trap, were all the other shocks absent, would have
been only 0.5% below its long-run average (figure 7). Furthermore, the duration of the zero lower bound constraint is fairly short, according to the

model. The zero lower bound was hit in 2008, but after 2010 the interest
rate suggested by the Taylor rule was actually higher than the one implemented by the Fed by one percent until the second part of 2012 (Figure 9).
Hence, the surprise tightening from 2008 to 2010 was followed by a surprisingly loose monetary policy afterwards, though more modest in size. We
study more closely the Taylor rule to better understand the interest rate
dynamics.
It is worth recalling that the Smets-Wouters (2007) version of the Taylor
rule, which we use here, is given by
(1)

it = ī + ρR it−1 + (1 − ρR )(ψ1 πt + ψ2 xt ) + ψ3 (xt − xt−1 ) + rt

where xt is the output gap. It turns out that the change-in-the-output-gap
term is key, while the output-gap term itself is not.
Figure 10 decomposes the interest rate rule into its components. Even
in the presence of a large output gap, the effect due to this component
on the interest rate dynamics is relatively small, because the parameter of
the Taylor rule, ψ2 is small (0.08).17 Inflation did not have considerable
effects on the interest rate. As a matter of fact, although inflation is a
quantitatively important component of the interest rate rule, it remained
below but close to the inflation target during the post crisis. The output
gap growth is the main responsible for the initial drop of the natural rate
below zero and for its subsequent increase. As the output gap dramatically
decreased, the interest rate suggested by the Taylor rule decreased below
zero. Afterwards, however, the output gap has remained negative but stable.
As a consequence, the Taylor rule interest rate slowly moved back above the

zero lower bound, according to this pre-crisis model.
This Taylor rule may differ from other specifications studied in the literature, some of which create a considerably larger gap between the implied
interest rate and zero. It is here, though, where the “retro” part of our
analysis is a particularly important disciplining device: it forces us to stick
to the Smets-Wouters (2007) specification rather than allow us to “pick”
the importance of the zero lower bound post-crisis.18 We view this as a
strength of our approach rather than a drawback and a complement to the
more recent literature.

The concerns regarding the threat of deflation is typically motivated by
its link to the level of unemployment, via some Phillips curve tradeoff. This
Phillips Curve relationship is examined in figures 11, 12 and 13. The relationship with inflation is certainly not a tight one, and it is therefore
imperative to account for the movements in employment and contrast them
with those in inflation.
The shock-by-shock decomposition of employment for the entire sample
is provided in figures 14 and 15. The overall secular movements seem to
be well explained by the wage markup shock alone. However, as for the
case of inflation, a substantial gap opens for 2007 and beyond (actually
starting earlier than that), when the wage markup shock would have actually
predicted much higher employment than observed.
As for inflation, we zoom in on the last period of the sample. Figures 16,

17 and 18 provide a decomposition of the labor movements for 2007 and
beyond. A combination of risk premium shocks, monetary policy shocks
and investment-specific technology shocks seem to largely account for the
decline: adding price markup shocks as well provides a nearly complete
account. By contrast, government expenditure shocks as well as TFP shocks
played only a modest role at best. Interestingly, shocks to the risk premium,
to monetary policy and to the investment-specific technology account for the
entire initial drop in employment starting in 2008 (Figure 19, left panel).
However, these shocks alone are not able to explain the puzzling subsequent
slow recovery, which can only be explained if we also take into account
the price markup shocks in addition to the previous ones (Figure 19, right
panel).
A similar picture also emerges from the variance decomposition in tables 5

and 6. It should be noted that the contribution of monetary policy shocks for
the post-2005 sample is not particularly different from that of the full sample
for the 4-period ahead variance decomposition and actually declines for the
asymptotic variance decomposition. The same is true for shocks to the risk
premium and investment-specific technology shocks. Wage markup shocks,
by contrast, explain a lot, and even more so asymptotically for the post-2005
sample. Given that these shocks imply higher employment than currently

observed in the data, this may be good news for those who are worried
about high unemployment rates. There is a difference here for all these
numbers in terms of their contribution to the four-quarter ahead variance of
the forecast error versus the unconditional (or 200-period-ahead) variance.
This is due to some shocks having a larger impact at high frequencies, while
other shocks account more for the low frequencies.

Zero Lower Bound

One obvious objection to our approach is related to the fact that the model
does not take explicitly into account the zero lower bound. As a result, it
may be hard to judge whether we are overestimating or underestimating the
effects of a tightened monetary policy on inflation and output during the
crisis years.
We use a very simple model to gain some insight on the issue. Although

To close the model we need an equation for the interest rate. We want
to compare two interest rate paths. In the first one (Case A), the agents
recognize the existence of the zero lower bound.
• Case A: it = max{0, ĩt }
In the second case (Case B), the zero lower bound is modeled as an unexpected exogenous positive shock.
• Case B: it = ĩt + m

where ĩt is the interest rate consistent with the Taylor rule.

known to agents under Case A. The qualitative results are not affected by
the introduction of this simplification.
Consider a sufficiently large demand shock. As a result of it, the economy
is in a liquidity trap from period t = 0 to t = τ . The behavior of the interest
rate is described in the left panel of Figure 20. The interest rate becomes
zero in period zero and it remains at the zero lower bound from period zero
to period τ . Afterwards it stays positive forever.
We compare the behavior of the economy under the two cases described
above. In the first case, the agents fully internalize the fact that the economy
is stuck in a liquidity trap. In the latter, the liquidity trap is a shock of
decreasing intensity occurring each period.
From τ onwards, the two cases do not differ. Therefore, output gap and
inflation are the same. At τ , the economy is in a liquidity trap, so the
nominal interest rate is zero. However, in period t = τ − 1, the two cases
have different predictions for the expected inflation rate and expected output

It follows that Eτ −1 xB
τ > Eτ −1 xτ , because Eτ −1 ĩτ < 0. Therefore, at τ − 1

both output gap and inflation are higher in Case B than in Case A.
Recursively, we can prove it for any period from t = 2 to t = τ − 1.
Since the realization for the periods since t = τ are the same under the two
scenarios and in Case A inflation is always lower than inflation under Case
B, it follows that, on impact, it has to be that output gap and inflation drop
more in Case A than in Case B. Moreover, the output gap when agents fully

internalize the zero lower bound grows at a faster pace after a recession, but
the recession itself is deeper.
The Great Recession and the liquidity trap recently spurred revived interest in the solution of quantitative models where the zero lower bound
on the nominal interest rate is explicitly taken into account.

Guerrieri

and Iacoviello (2013) provide an algorithm to find a deterministic solution for models with occasionally binding constraints. Their approach can
potentially be extended further in order to perform a historical shock decomposition as above. While perhaps feasible, this violates the spirit of
our exercise of employing a retro analysis to the question of accounting for
inflation.
But more importantly, a full treatment of the liquidity trap requires subtle
choices regarding the expectations of agents regarding the path of future
monetary policy variables at the onset of the 2008 crisis. Although the
little exercise shows that our analysis might be underestimating the effect
of the zero lower bound on inflation, other specifications for the behavior of
monetary policy can easily introduce a bias of opposite sign. For example,
Eggertsson and Woodford (2005) have suggested that keeping interest rates
low upon exiting the zero lower bound is the best strategy for the central
bank during a liquidity trap, leading to an avoidance of deflation. Indeed,
one can read our figure 9 that this is what the Federal Reserve Bank has been
doing, as it exited the constraint around mid-2010, according the model. If
that is the case, and as agents anticipate the correspondingly looser policy
upon exit, positive levels of inflation will result from the forward-looking
nature of the price-setting behavior by firms. It appears to be hard to fully
settle this matter, without taking a strong stance on subtle and hard-to-

measure matters of expectation formation.
We conclude that our analysis may therefore well provide a proper benchmark for accounting for post-crisis inflation and employment.
VII.

Conclusion

In spite of the widespread fears, the US did not experience a period of
deflation during the recession following the events of 2008. During these
years, inflation has been low but positive and stable, despite the slackness
in the economy. It is therefore of interest to understand why this is so.
We used a pre-crisis “retro” model by Smets and Wouters (2007) to account for the movements in inflation. The model allows for a “risk premium”
shock to move the value of capital, but does not otherwise incorporate financial frictions. Moreover, the log-linearized solution and equations effectively
mean, that agents consider zero nominal interest rates as a surprisingly tight
monetary policy stance, if the unconstrained Taylor rule would have implied
negative rates instead.
While price and wage markup shocks nearly suffice to account for the inflation movements prior to the crisis of 2008, a gap opens after that date.
Indeed, by themselves they would have predicted a considerably higher inflation than what has been observed in the data. We find that due to price
markup shocks alone inflation would have been 1% higher than observed and
0.5% higher that the long-run average. This answers a key question of this
paper: there is no deflation and, actually, some inflation for the same reason that there was inflation at other times, namely price- and wage-markup
shocks.
The gap is explained by the other shocks in the system, notably monetary

policy shocks. The unconstrained Taylor rule of the model predicts that
interest rates should have been somewhat negative from 2008 to 2010, while
the zero lower bound constrained them from that: this is the effect many
observers feared and pointed to. It should be noted, however, that the
magnitude of this effect is rather modest. The model predicts that the
inflation drop due to the liquidity trap, were all the other shocks absent,
would have been only 0.5% below zero. Furthermore, the duration of the
zero lower bound constraint is fairly short, according to the model. The
zero lower bound was hit in 2008, but after 2010 the interest rate suggested
by the Taylor rule was actually higher than the one implemented by the
Fed by one percent until the second part of 2012 (Figure 9). According
the model then, the surprise tightening from 2008 to 2010 was followed by
a surprisingly loose monetary policy afterwards, though that counterswing
was more modest in size.
