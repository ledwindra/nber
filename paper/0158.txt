          Since the early sixties, students have been attracted to the study and

to the practice of law. The number of lawyers increased by 33 percent between

1960 and 1970 after growing by just l4 percent during the previous decade.

Interest in the law has not declined since 1970. The annual number of new ad-

missions to the Bar was higher in 1975 than in 1970 by 91 percent. This rapid

growth, while unusual, is not unprecedented in the United States, as witness the

30 percent increase in the number of lawyers (and judges) from 1920 to 1930

(Table 1, nor is it limited to the United States, as witness the increase in

the number of lawyers in Canada and in England during the sixties. Table 1

also shows the United States has been historically more lawyer intensive than

Canada   and England.
         The renewed interest in the practice of the law andthese international
comparisons,   crude as they are, raise several questions about the underlying

determinants of the demand for lawyers. The prosperity of the twenties and sixties

indicates the level of economic activity is an important determinant of the demand

for laywers. The role of government regulation is less obvious and more difficult

to detect. It is often said the social legislation of the sixties, the expanding

scope of government regulations and judicial rulings are responsible for the

increase in the number of lawyers. Those who advance the regulation hypothesis

often support it with evidence from the sixties. The appeal of the regulation

hypothesis is reduced if a longer span of time is studied. The regulation

hypothesis does not explain why the U.S. has been historically more lawyer

intensive than Canada and England and cannot explain the rapid growth in

lawyers during the twenties. Nor does economic theory unambiguously predict

an increase in regulation will increase the number of lawyers. At least some

types of regulations of industry simultaneously raise the cost of production

and increase the use of lawyers. Regulations of this type, e.g. noise or

pollution control, encourage a more intensive use of lawyers, but also reduce

    industry output and employment because of higher product prices. whether this

    type of regulation increases the number of lawyers, depends on the strength of

    these two opposing forces.!' Economic theory and some of the empirical evidence

    suggests that government regulation may not be an important a determinant of

    the demand for lawyers. Clearly some additional evidence on the comparative

    effect of income, regulation as well as other variables on the demand for

    lawyers is called for.

              Professional training in law often requires three years of schooling.

    Specialized training could lead to oscillatory or "cobweb" patterns in earnings

    and numberof lawyers if prospective entrants fail to correctly forecast future

    demand and cost conditions. Recent concern has been expressed that the current

    large enrollments in law schools will depress earnings in law as the market

    adjusts   to the large graduating classes. Freeman [l97!+] provides some results
.   suggesting that such oscillations are an important characteristic of the market

    for lawyers. There are, however, several reasons to suspect that oscillations

    due to systemmatic forecast errors cannot be of great importance in the market

    for lawyers. The training of lawyers is sufficiently general that recent

    graduates could and have substituted into other business occupations if and

    when earnings in law are unduly depressed. In addition, systematic forecast

    errors committed by prospective law students imply the periodic existence of

    profitable investments in legal education. These reasons suggest a reconsider-

    ation of the legal market to determine if cobweb patterns are in fact an

    important phenomenon of the market for lawyers.


            !'If new legislation or administrative rulings reduce uncertainty at a
    lower transaction cost than would occur within the existing legal system in
    the absence of the new legislation, then the demand for lawyers may decline
    with added regulation.
        Another objective of this paper is to investigate the speed of adjust-

ment of law schools to shifts in the demand for lawyers. Law schools are

members of private nonprofit and public educational institutions. A large

proportion of law schools are approved by the American Bar Association (ABA).

Profit making law schools are excluded from the market and have been opposed

by the A.B.A. The organization of the legal education industry and the effect

of this type of organization on property rights and on the speed of adjust-

ment of enrollments to shifts in demand have not been given serious attention.

        Section I presents a theortical model of the demand for and supply of

lawyers. The empirical counterpafts of the variables are introduced in Section

II. Section III presents the results of the estimation and Section IV compares

the actual number of lawyers with the number that would have existed if lawyers

earned a normal return on their investment in legal education. Section V

presents other evidence of an excess demand for lawyers and offers several

explanations for the speed of adjustment of enrollments in law schools to shifts

in the demand for lawyers. The paper ends with a summary of the major findings

of the paper.



                          I. The Theoretical Model

        The number of practicing lawyers in year t equals a fraction of the

number practicing in year t - 1   plus a fraction of new admissions to the bar

in year t.

        Not all new admissions begin the practice of law. While the depreci-
ation rate of new admissions may differ from the rate for existing lawyers, it
could be higher or lower. Older and more experienced lawyers have greater
investments in on the job training and would have lower depreciation rates to
offset the higher rates due to retirements, etc.

                                                                                   .

where d denotes the depreciation rate and measures the effects of voluntary

quits, deaths and retirements. New admissions to the bar in t equal some

proportion of first year law students in year t - 3,

able and represents successful candidates who have failed the bar examination

in previous attempts or have taken longer to complete law school because they

were part time students.

        The demand for legal services in t is given by

                    =      +        + a2Z + Ut               a1 < 0, a     >0


where LS denotes the quantity of legal services demanded, LEt denotes the

annual earnings per lawyer, Z. is a vector of exogenous variables (discussed

in detail below) and u is a disturbance terni)1


        'The quantity demanded is normally related to the price charged per
day (hour), t• Earnings have been used as a substitute. This approximation
is acceptable if total days worked per year, ht and the share of total revenues
accounted for by operating costs, vt, have not changed appreciably over time.

        The quantity of legal services supplied, LS is assumed to increase

with the number of lawyers, Lt, and the earnings of lawyers. The existing

stock of lawyers supplies more services by increasing the use of other factors

when legal earnings rise and increases in the number of lawyers increases the

supply of legal services, given legal earnings

where Vt is a disturbance term. Under this formulation an increase in

earnings outside of the legal industry does not have an immediate effect on

the supply of legal services but reduces the supply of legal services in the

long run by reducing the number of lawyers. Given the stock of lawyers,

Since     -    < 0, LE. decreases with Lt and increases with Z..

        In long run equilibrium the number of lawyers is determined so that

prospective law student anticipates a normal rate of return on the investment

in legal education. If the number of lawyers is less than this equi1ibrum

number, the anticipated rate of return on the investment in legal education wi1

exceed the normal rate of return. The number of' first year law students will

increase and three years later the number of lawyers will increase. This

adjustment to long run equilibrium may   be   described with the aid of'   graphs.
Let the demand curve for legal services be given by DD in Figure 1. If the

current number of lawyers is L1, the supply curve of legal services is given

by SS. Assume a college graduate can earn U dollars per year.              Because

the college graduate must forego U for three years while attending law

school, the graduate will enter law school only if LE > (1 +         r)3 U.W
Because LE1 > (1 +   r)U,   the anticipated rate of return from legal training

exceeds the normal rate of return, r. Law school enrollments and the number of

lawyers increase. The supply curve shifts to S'S'. The number of lawyers

increases to L2, earnings decline to (1 + r)3U            and the quantity of legal

services increases to LS2. The market is now in long run equilibrium since a

normal rate of return is earned on the investment in legal education

        In long run equilibrium the annual earnings of a lawyer may be expected

to exceed (1 + r)3U.   The probability of completing law school and passing the

bar examination within three years of beginning law school has been appreciably

less than one, varying from an estimated low of .26 in 1938 to a high of .7

in 1969 over the l925-l94O and 1951-1970 periods.' Embarking on a legal

career has been a somewhat risky endeavor. It is iossible to derive an estimate

of long run equilibrium earnings that reflects the probability of failure.


          The present value of earnings for a college graduate is:


                                               1••
                                   i=C       (l+r)1
The present value of earnings for a college graduate who enters and completes
law school is (ignoring tuition):


                                    LE
                                   i=3       (1 +   r)1
These two streams are equal if LE =      (1 + r)3U.

candidates who fail the initial bar examination try again until they pass.

        The probability of completing law school, , and the probability of

passing the bar examination, p, help determine the annual earnings of a lawyer

when the market is in long run equilibrium. In Appendix A the long run

equilibrium earnings of a lawyer are shown equal to

where 1 +   rh   (0 < h < 1)   is the assumed rate of return earned by a law student

who has graduated but has not passed the bar exaznlnation)1 Equation (6) indi-

cates the real earnings of lawyers should exceed the real earnings of college

graduates by more than (1 +     r)U     if p or             is less than one. Table II

shows that a change in         has a larger effect on the LE to U ratio than a

comparable change in

        Equation (6) may be modified to reflect the uncertainty of future

earnings of lawyers and college graduates. In long run equilibrium the fore-

cast made in t - 3      of real annual earnings per lawyer in t,                 is
                                                                         t_3t'

         Equation (8) defines an equilibrium in terms of the forecasts of the

earnings of a representative lawyer and a representative college graduate. With

rational expectations the forecast of earnings in t made by first year law

students in t - 3       is assumed equal to the mean of the distribution of lawyer

earnings in t [Muth, 1961].

where   E denotes the mathematical expectation given the information available

in t - 3.   First year law students are assumed to neither systematically over

or under estimate their future earnings under rational expectations.

        In t - 3        anticipated lawyer earnings in t will depend on the current

stock of lawyers, Lt3, the current flow through the pipeline,
                                                                           Ft5, Ft, Ft3

Equation (13) requires that new admissions in period t equal the difference

between the number of lawyers demanded at the anticipated equilibrium earnings

per laywer (the expression in the square brackets) and the expected number of

lawyers in t as projected in t - 3        from the size of the entering classes

in t -    14   and t - 5.

          The actual number of first year students may be less than the long run

equilibrium number during periods of growth. Entry by profit making law

schools is prohibited and entry by nonprofit law schools is regulated by

minimum   requirements   established by the A.B.A. Within the nonprofit sector

the incentives for growth are attenuated. Tuition does not differ appreciably between

departments or professional schools and is independent of demand conditions.

In many law schools tuition could have been increased in the last ten years or

so without reducing enrollment but with a lowering of the quality of student.

Yet, some law schools act as if any increase in the net income of the law

school due to an increase in tuition or enrollment will be taxed at a high

marginal rate. In particular, the incentive to increase enrollment is reduced

if the use in net income reverts to the central administration. The degree

of attenuation of property rights is not random across law schools. In his

pioneering study of law schools in the twenties Reed [1928] distinguished

between law schools in universities with extensive private endowments or

public support and those in universities with little private or public support.
                                       1j4




Law schools in universities with little private or public support were in

fact virtually independent operations whose net revenue depended on their

ability to attract tuition paying students. These law schools placed relatively

low prerequisites on prospective students requiring none or one year of college.

Well endowed law schools placed higher prerequisites on prospective students

by requiring a college degree. Differences in this type of behavior can be

explained by differences in property rights. While changes have occurred

since, the distinction between higher and lower quality schools remains a useful

one. In summary there are two reasons for expecting a slower response to a

shift in demand for lawyers: restrictions on the formation of new law schools

and the attenuation of property rights in existing law schools.JJ

        If these arguments have some validity, the actual number of first year

students may at times differ from the equilibrium number.   The speed of response

by the legal education industry to shifts in demand can be estimated and the

model has been formulated to provide some estimates of this response rate.

it is assumed that the number of places in law schools for first year students

is always large enough to satisfy replacement demand due to retirements, etc.

The number of first year students required to satisfy replacement demand equals

(dt3Lti)/(ct(l_d)). A second assumption is that places for first year

students expand so that a proportion, w, of the discrepancy between the

equilibrium   number of lawyers in t and the projected number of lawyers in t,


              attenuation of property rights should also exist in other fields
as well, e.g. business. If the legal education industry respondçs less rapidly
than the business education industry, it is presumably because of differences
in the cost of entry.

values equal the actual values of these variables plus a nonserial correlated

random variable. Under this assumption, the actual values of the variables

able (1 +   r)3   Ht3Ut. Lti enters with a positive coefficient in (l6a) and

a negative coefficient in (l6b) or (16c) if w > d. As w approaches zero

        The analysis could be extended by forecasting each of the exogenous

bias because the disturbance term in the regression includes                        which is
correlated with the independent variable Z. If the variance of                          is small

             II. Discussion of Selected Time Series, 1920-1970


A. Number of Lawyers, New Admissions and First Year Law Students

        A continuous time series of lawyers from 1920 to 1970 does not exist.

The decennial census estimates of the number of lawyers may be combined with

the annual number of new admissions to the bar to produce an estimate of the

depreciation rate for each decade from the expression



                 Lt =      (1   -   d)1 t-i   + (1   - d)10
                                                              Ltio


where Lt and Lt10 are Census of Population estimates of practicing lawyers1

and NAt. is known for i = 0         to i = 9. A value of d may be determined

which satisfies the equality during each decade from 1910 to 1970. The

decennial estimates of d are shown below.




       IlEquation (16c) could be estimated by using      Dt/c and L1/ct
as independent variables. However, accurate estimates of c. are difficult
to obtain without separating full time from part time students. Some pre-
liminary results were not promising, perhaps because of the measurement errors
in



       JMore precisely, the Census combines lawyers and judges.

       1930-191xJ             .037           1960-1970          .o3o


        Comparatively low depreciation rates were experienced from 1910 to 1930
and from 1960-1970. The highest depreciation rate occurred in the decade from
1950 to 1960. It    is likely that trends in the depreciation rates accurately

reflect the level of prosperity in the legal service industry. By this test

the periods from 1910 to 1930 and 1960-1970 were prosperous ones for the legal

profession.

        Once the estimate of d is known for each decade, the number of

lawyers in each year of the decade may be estimated. As Table I indicates

the number of lawyers grew rapidly during the 1920's and in the l960's. This

may be seen even more clearly by examining the time path of new admissions

to the bar in Table III. New admissions increased rapidly after 1920 and

peaked in 1930. It is revealing that new admissions to the bar remained at

comparatively high levels during the first half of the thirties, averaging

9,)77 per year from 193019314. New admissions declined after i93L but still

averaged 8,772 per year from 1935-1939 compared to 9,132 per year from 1925-1929.

Given the large decline in real income from 1929 to 193)4, the modest decline

in new admissions over this period suggests that relative earnings of lawyers

remained high during the first half of the Depression. In the immediate post

war World War II period new admissions surged and then remained relatively

constant throughout the fifties at a level slightly higher than the late

twenties. New admissions have grown rapidly since 1963.

B. Actual and Equilibrium Earnings of Lawyers

        No continuous series of lawyer earnings exists and those that do exist

are limited. From 1929 to l95)- the Department of Commerce surveys estimate

the income of lawyers in individual practice. The Internal Revenue Service

(I.R.S.) provides tax   return   data of the net income of sole proprietors sub-

mitting Schedule C and informational return data of partners in 19-9 and 1953

and annually since 1957. The two      series   were spliced together by (l inter-

data is presented in Appendix B.

        Real lawyer earnings from 1929 to 1970 (in 19117 prices) are shown by

the series marked I in Figure II. Real earnings of lawyers remained fairly

stable from 1929 to the middle fifties and increased markedly thereafter. The

right hand side of equation (6) may be used to calculate an estimate of equi-

librium earnings of lawyers. Because a long time series of earnings of college

graduates or of high school graduates does not exist, annual earnings of full

time employees were adjusted upward to derive an estimate of the earnings of

high school graduates (see Appendix B). r was arbitrarily set at .10, an

estimate close to other estimates of the rate of return on education. The time



        'The I.R.S. estimates are below the Commerce estimates because a
lawyer who is a member of a partnership but also has some independent practice
will submit a Schedule C (as a single proprietor) and will also be included in
the information return of the partnership. A salaried lawyer with a practice
on the side will also submit a Schedule C return. Because of the method of
reporting, I.R.S. estimates of net income per lawyer should be biased downward.

                                                                                    .

series of estimated equilibrium earnings of lawyers is shown by the series

marked by 0 in Figure II.         The actual earnings of lawyers exceeded equi-

librium earnings by decreasing amounts from 1929 to the early fifties. The

discrepancy disappears in the early 1950's but reappears and increases throu,gh-

out the 1960' s. The ratio of actual to equilibrium earnings is shown    in   Figure

III. This ratio equaled 1.67 in 1929, declines, hovers around unity throughout

the early fifties, rises during the sixties and equaled 1.29 in 1970. This

review of the earnings data suggests the market was adjusting to long run

equilibrium between 1929 to the early fifties. Real lawyer earnings remained

flat from 1929 to the mid-fifties while long run equilibrium earnings continued

to increase. New admissions remained relatively high throughout the thirties

because of the relatively favorable earnings of lawyers although the decline

in new admissions in the late thirties is not explained by the relative

earnings data. During the fifties the market for lawyers appears to have been

in long run equilibrium, and the approximate stability of new admissions

during this period is consistent with this conclusion. The rise in new

admissions since 1963 is consistent with the rise in the relative earnings of

lawyers. A surprising finding of this historical review of relative earnings

is that the speed of adjustment to long run equilibrium has been low since the

excess of actual over equilibrium earnings has persisted for relatively long

periods of time.



C. Exogeneous Determinants of the Demand For Legal Services

        Given a body of law and current interpretations of this body of law,

increases   in   the level of economic activity will increase the number of

transactions     between consumers and firms and between firms and presumably raise
the demand for lawyers. Given the level of economic activity, an increase in

the number of regulations will also raise the demand for lawyers. The purpose

of the econometric estimation is to quantify these two effects)1

           Consumers, firms and governments are the major users of the services

of lawyers. Recent surveys do allow some perspective on the relative importance

of consumers and firms as contributors to revenue of the legal service industry,

i.e. single proprietors and partnerships and certain nonprofit firms. In

19)48 the Department of Commerce reported consumers accounted for 52 percent

of total billings of the legal service industry [Winfield, 19)49]. The 1972

Census of Selected Services reported consumers accounted for 53 percent

of total billings. Individuals appear to produce about the same dollar volume

as firms do and somewhat surprisingly, the consumer share has not declined

over tinie./                                                                       -
           Several proxy variables have been used to identify those transactions

where the services of a lawyer are likely to be used. The variables and the

symbols used are discussed below.




        !JTime series analysis may be a superior way of measuring the adjust-
ruent to equilibrium while a cross state analysis may be a superior way of
identifying the separate effects of each of the variables on the demand for
lawyers since the variables in the demand equation tend to move together
through time.


           'In house council and government lawyers would be excluded from these
figures.


        'If the burden of the increasing scope of regulation has been placed
on firms, it should have caused a relative rise in the use of the legal service
industry by the business sector. If this effect is operating, it has been
offset by a corresponding rise in the services demanded by consumers.
                                      25


1. Consumer

        Besides the level of real income, certain transactions have been

singled out for analysis.

        a. Real Estate Transactions (MORG): A continuous time series real

estate transactions does not exist. Nonfarm housing mortgage loans made by

savings and loans deflated by the rent price index were used as a measure of

the volume of transactions in the real estate market):!

        b. Divorce (DIV): The total divorce rate per 1000 population was

used.

        c. Automobile Accidents (LOSS): Real dollar losses paid by insurance

companies for auto insurance (property and liability) divided by total motor

vehicle registrations was used.



2. Business

        Transactions among firms create a demand for legal services. The volume

of transactions among firms in an economy will be directly related to the size

of the economy. Given the size of the economy, the number of transactions

requiring legal services will depend on the average size of the firm.

If there are relatively few firms in the economy so that the average size of

a firm is relatively large, the demand for legal services should be smaller

since the number of nonmarket transactions increases, i.e., transactions within

the firm will be larger. As the number of firms increases, the number of market

transactions will rise and with it the demand for legal services. Still further



        I/Shorter series of the volume of mortgage recordings do exist. By
combining these measures, a-time series of mortgage recordings can be con-
structed. No change in results was obtained with these alternative measures.
                                         26


increases in the number of firms may reduce the demand for legal services since

smaller firms are likely to use other less costly methods of resolving and

enforcing conflicts. Given the size of the economy the demand for legal

services is likely to rise with increases in the size of the firm up to a

point and thereafter decrease because more nonmarket transactions occur.

The proxy measures used to represent business demand for legal services are:

        a. Real Gross National Product (RGNP): The number of market trans.-

actions among firms and the demand for legal services is expected to rise

with real gross national product.

        b. Number of Firms (AC): Because a continuous series of the business

population is unavailable, the number of active corporations as reported by

the Internal Revenue Service was used.



3. Judicial and Regulatory Activity

        The central difficulty in measuring the effect of government regulation

on the number of lawyers is that the available measures of regulation are

deficient in one or more ways. Some new laws or regulations create legal

uncertainties which are resolved through court activity. Measures of court

activity are available and may be used as a proxy for government regulation.

However, some new laws are sufficiently precise and some judicial interpretations

are so clear that the amount of subsequent judicial activity will be negligible

even though the effect on the demand for lawyers can be large. A new tax

law may increase the demand for (tax) lawyers without an appreciable

increase in subsequent court activity. While, the effects of regulation are

large, they would not be reflected in court activity. Hence, court activity

is an admittedly imperfect proxy for the scope of government regulation.
                                              27


               Rules promulgated and   enforced   by regulatory commissions raise

    similar issues. On the other hand the scope of activity of regulatory

    commissions cannot be independent of the available resources. The number and

    thoroughness of investigations and the level of enforcement of regulations

    depend on the size of the budgets of these commissions. It is assumed that

    the scale of activity of regulatory commissions is directly related to resources

    available to these agencies.

              The proxy variables for regulatory activity are

              a. Court Activity (TCA). Number of Federal District court cases

    commenced plus the number of bankruptcies filed is used. It should be noted

    the    judicial activity at the state level has been ignored.
              b. Regulatory Commission Activity (BEG). The total real budget of
    15 federal regulatory agencies was     used    as the measure of regulatory activity
•   [see Stigler, l972]. It is worth examining the behavior of this measure
    over   time relative to the size of the economy to see if it conforms with con-

    ventional views of changes in government regulation. Regulatory expenditures

    per $10,000 of gross national product for selected years are shown in

    Table IV. Relative to the size of the economy, regulatory input declined

    during the late twenties, rose during the thirties and reached a peak by 19110.

    An erratic pattern followed with a decline in the middle fifties. Regulatory

    expenditures have increased relative to the economy since the late fifties so

that by 1976    the   ratio was approaching the high of the late thirties. This

series suggests that the scope of regulation was widest in the late thirties

and late sixties during the 1925-1970 period. It should be noted the rate

of growth of lawyers was declining in the late thirties, while increasing in

the late sixties. Further, the decline in the scope of regulation in the

late twenties was accompanied by a continued growth in new admissions. This

admittedly partial analysis of        the   data suggests that regulatory expenditures

have    not had a large quantitative effect on the demand for lawyers.
          As an aid to the reader a siimmPry of        the   symbols used for each variable
is    presented in   Chart   I.




                                  III. Regression Results


          Regression results for equations (l6a) and (l6b) are displayed in

Table V. These equations were estimated with the Hildrith—Lu search process

over a grid of values for the first order serial correlation coefficient, p.

Results are presented for the smallest transformed sum of squares.

          The coefficient of Lt_i is positive in (16a) and negative in (l6b)

if w > d. Except for twD cases, the estimated coefficients have the correct

signs.    The numerical magnitude of these          coefficients indicates the speed of

         toward long run equilibrium is relatively low. The estimates in
adjustment

columns 1-4 indicate w ranges from .03 to .17. This finding is independent
of,   but consistent with, the slow adjustment of actual lawyer earnings to
long run equilibrium earnings noted above.
          Two variables      were used to measure the opportunity cost of choosing
the   law as an occupation and both indicate a rise in earnings outside of the

 equilibrium earnings and is derived from real annual earnings of full time

 workers in the private sector. RGNPP measures real per capita gross national

product. Given BEA, a rise in RGNPP is thought to reflect an improvement in

 employment opportunities in the private sector and, for this reason, leads to

a reduction in the number of lawyers)1

          The most important determinant of the demand for legal services and

for lawyers is real gross national product. Shifts in the demand for lawyers

are due for the most part to changes in real income. On the other hand, the

form in which wealth is held appears to have little differential effect on the

demand for   lawyers. No consistent effect of real property and   liability
losses   paid   by automobile insurance companies or of the measures for the turn-

over of the housing stock were observed. It appears that increases in real

income increases the number of transactions, a fraction of which require

consumers and firms to use the services of lawyers.

          The time series results do indicate the divorce rate is a significant

but quantitatively small determinant of the demand for lawyers. So, marital

instability does increase the number of lawyers but this effect is small

compared to a comparable increase in real income.



        RGrPP varies more over time than REA and is more sensitive to
cyclical changes. REA is a measure of opportunity cost assuming the worker
is employed full time in the private sector. On the other hand, fluctuation
in RGNPP appear as a proxy for employment conditions in the private sector,
improving when RGNPP rises. While other methods of adjusting for changes in
employment conditions have not been explored, an alternative is to adjust
REA directly for under and unemployment.

          The effect of the size of corporation on the demand for lawyer is

unclear. Columns (2) and (1.) indicate an increase in the size of corporation

increases the number of lawyers. However, this result is sensitive to the

inclusion of real per capita income (columns 1 and 3). Great reliance cannot

be placed on this result.

          Different   effects are observed for the regulatory variables. Total
court activity is positively related to the demand for lawyers and      to new

admissions if per capita income is excluded. Column        (l) suggests that the

number of court cases and not the number of bankruptcies is      important. If
court activity is a measure of the increasing scope of government regulation,

then there is some support for the hypothesis that regulation increases the

demand for lawyers. However, this effect is quantitatively small (see

below). The budgets of regulatory commissions have no significant effects on

the number of lawyers and are inversely related to new admissions. Hence,

this measure of regulation does not suggest that the legal profession benefits

from regulation.

          In summary the    number of lawyers appears to decline with increases
in the foregone earnings      of becoming a lawyer.   The quantity demanded of
legal   services appears to increase with the level of economic activity,

the divorce rate, the scale of judicial activity and may decrease with

the   scale of regulatory activity.

the long-run number    of   lawyers is shown in Table VI. These elasticities

number of lawyers. The elasticities are evaluated at the mean                      values   of the

variables. The estimates in columns 2 and              are   derived from the two           regres-
sions with the highest explanatory power. If reliance is placed on these

estimates, it appears that the real product elasticity is in the i.8 to 2.0

range.   The elasticities of the other variables in the demand curve are

decidedly lower with the divorce rate elasticity around .3. It is apparent

that   the major variable increasing the demand for lawyers has been the
increase in real gross national product. A 10 percent increase in long run
equilibrium   earnings and in real per capita income reduces the number of

lawyers by 2.0 to 2.5 percent.L"




                      IV. The Equilibrium Number of Lawyers


          Equation   (l6a) may be       solved for the equilibrium number           of lawyers,
LE, by letting Lt = Lti         =   L

(17)            L=         {   (a -        + a2        +
                                                           (a1
                                                                 -
                                                                     )   -   ((1   +   r ) 3UtHt)]

The equilibrium number of lawyers in each year may be derived by setting



        'If a profession maximized the total wage bill of its existing
members, the salary per member would be determined so that salary elasticity
equals -1. The results suggest the salary (earnings) elasticity is less
than -1. This evidence does not indicate the pass rate on the bar examination
has been determined so as to maximize total earnings. It should be noted
the elasticities are calculated on the assumption that the actual number
of lawyers equals the equilibrium number. Since the actual number has often
been less than the equilibrium number,            the actual elasticities will differ
from the elasticities shown in Table VI.

Lt_i = 0      and dividing the r.h.s. of (16a) by one minus the coefficient of

Lti. The estimated coefficients have been used to derive L€ in equation

 (17). The estimate of the equilibrium number of lawyers in a given year

assumes (1) the exogenous variables remain constant thereafter,          (2) the

equilibrium rate of return on legal education equals 10 percent, and (3) the

completion rates of law students are exogenous.!" By comparing this time

series of the equilibrium number of lawyers with the actual time series of

lawyers,     it   is possible to determine the time periods when the rate of return

on   legal   education exceeded 10 percent. Whenever the actual number of lawyers

is less than the equilibrium number, it may be inferred that the actual rate

of return on legal education exceeded 10 percent.

                  Figure IV shows the equilibrium and actual number of lawyers in each

year from l925_19140 and 1951-1970.        The equilibrium number of lawyers   was
estimated     from the coefficient estimates (column 2 of Table V); the regression

with the smaller residual standard error. Table VII shows the ratio of equi-

librium to     actual number of lawyers and the ratio of actual to equilibrium
earnings     for selected   years.   The ratio of equilibrium to actual number of

lawyer is largest in the mid-twenties and declines thereafter and approaches

one in 19110. After the post war adjustment, the ratio hovers near but some-

what aboveunitythrou.ghout the nineteen fifties and then rises from 1960 to

1970 and was in the 1. 17-1.19 range in 1970, not      far different from the value
reached    in 1929. The time series pattern of the ratio of actual to equilibrium

earnings shows a similar pattern except for one major exception. The ratio



            .i/'Completion rates are positively correlated with the rate of return
to the investment on legal education. If the rate of return to legal education
fell to 10 percent, the completion rates would decline, equilibrium earnings
of lawyers would rise, and the equilibrium number of lawyers would decrease.
Hence, the estimates of the equilibrium number of lawyers are biased upward
when the completion rates are considered exogenous.

of   earnings is largest in 1929 and declines throughout the thirties. However,

the ratio of earnings far exceeds unity in l94O while the ratio of equilibrium

to actual number of lawyers is near unity in 191lO. In the post war period the

ratio of earnings remains near unity throughout the fifties and then rises

from 1960 to 1970 and equals 1.29 in 1970. The two independent tests, the

ratio of earnings and the ratio of numbers suggest the rate of return to

legal education exceeded 10 percent throughout the twenties, most of the

thirties, and throughout the sixties.!/

         Figure IV reveals why an equilibrium was finally achieved in the middle

fifties. The equilibrium number of lawyers grew by only •14 percent per year

from 1925 to 19)40 and by about .6   percent   per year from 1925 to 1956.

Changes in real income, divorce rates and other determinants of the demand
for legal services were on balance offset by increases in the opportunity cost

of legal education, so that the equilibrium number of lawyers demanded at

long run equilibrium earnings did not increase appreciably over a 30 year

period ending in the middle fifties.

         Given the low speed of adjustment in the production of lawyers, a

long run equilibrium was not achieved until the late thirties. After the

post war adjustment a long run equilibrium was reestablished throughout the



          This comparison of the ratio of earnings to the ratio of numbers
indicates the actual earnings of lawyers reported by the Department of Commerce
during the thirties are probably biased upward. The ratio of equilibrium to
actual number of lawyers suggests the market was close to equilibrium by 19)40.
The depreciation rate of the stock of lawyers was relatively high for the
decade of the thirties compared to the twenties. These two sources of infor-
mation raise the suspicion that the earnings of lawyers reported in the surveys
conducted by the Department of Commerce during the 1930's are biased upward.
The surveys conducted in the post war period do not indicate the same degree
of bias. No explanation can be offered for the apparent improvement in the
quality of the data.

fifties. Increases in RGNP and other demand determinants throughout the

1960's have increased the demand for legal services. Once again, the low

speed of adjustment of places in law schools created a gap between the actual

and equilibrium number of lawyers. By 1970 the ratio of equilibrium to

actual number of lawyers was between 1.17 to 1.19, not far different from

the ratio in 1929.




                               V. Other Evidence


        Other evidence indicates a widening discrepancy between the actual

and equilibrium number of lawyers throughout the sixties and into the early

seventies. Table VIII shows the number of (LSAT) tests administered to

prospective law school students relative to first year law students and the

mean score on the tests administered. Comparable data are shown for prospective

graduate students in business. In both law and business there has been a rapid

rise in total tests administered. However, the trend to testing occurred

earlier in law than in business so that a smaller proportion of the increase

in testing intensity (columns 3 and ti-)   is    due to the rise in the number

of law schools requiring testing.1 The evidence suggests that there has been

an increasing interest in entering law school and probably an increase in the

quality of law students.1 In contrast the mean score of prospective business



        'The number of schools requiring the test is unknown. However, conver-
sations with informed individuals suggests that most law and business schools
were requiring the test by the middle sixties.

        'The number of tests administered differs from the number of individuals
taking the test since some individuals repeat the test. The repeat rate appears
to be higher in law than in business. The higher repeat rate in law than
business is consistent with a larger discrepancy between the actual and equi-
libirum stock in law than in business.

a)    Law school and business school tests are taken by students entering law school and graduate business
      schools.  The number of law and business schools requiring the test as part of the application process
      has increased over time. While there are no figures available, informal opinion suggests that most
      law and business schools required the test by the mid-sixties. Repeaters are included.

b)    Enrolled first year students reported by the Journal of Legal Education includes full and part-time
      students.

c)    Includes M.B.A. and   doctoral    students and    full   and part-time students.

d)    Data supplied by Educational Testing Service.   The tests are formed SO that the absolute level of
      the test scores are not comparable across fields.

If the student drops out of law school after 2 years (virtually all dropouts
occur within the first two years), he receives:

        The present value of earnings for a student entering law school is:

quality variation presumably also exists in other fields, e.g. business.

A detailed study of business education has not yet been undertaken. However

supply response of the business education sector is not likely to be as slow.

A major difference between law and business is the ease of entry into the

education sector. A comparison between law and business is instructive.

While both sectors have experienced a rapid increase in the demand for pro-

fessional education, they differ in the number of new schools entering the

market. The number of business schools offering graduate programs increased

from 183 in 1960-61, 254 in 1966-67 and 360 in 1972-73. Similar counts

of the number of law schools are 158 in 1960-61, 166 in 1966-67 and 190 in

1972-73. The number of business schools increased by about 97 percent

since 1960 while the number of law schools has increased by 20 percent.

The comparatively modest expansion in the number of law schools may explain

why the ratio of tests administered to first year students has increased

more rapidly in law than in business since the middle sixties (when realistic

comparisons are possible) and why the mean score of prospective law students

has increased relative to mean score of prospective business students.

        A further test of the regression results is to explain behavior after

1970. The empirical results suggest that the rate of return to legal educa-

tion exceeded 10 percent in 1970. The ratio of equilibrium to actual number

of lawyers was between 1.17 and 1.19. The subsequent behavior of first year

enrollments and new admissions is consistent with this evidence. Table X

shows first year students enrolled in law schools and new admissions, the

equilibrium and actual number, and the estimates of the number of lawyers

from 1970 to 1974. The equilibrium number of lawyers is estimated with the

actual or extrapolated values of the exogenous variables from 1971 to 1974.
        Table X shows first year students increased somewhat from 1970 to

197)4 and remained at relatively high levels between 1973 and l974. If the

difference between the equilibrium and actual number of lawyers had declined

from 1970 to 19711., the number of first year students should have declined.

The evidence suggests that the gap between the equilibrium and actual number

of lawyers increased from 1970 to 1973 and then declined in 197)4 and helps

explain why the size of the first year class has not declined appreciably.

Nevertheless, the large number of new admissions in 1973 and 197)4 has sub-

stantially increased the number of practicing lawyers and a subsequent decline

in the size of the first year class would not be surprising.




                                 Conclusions


        During the last half century the legal profession has experienced

two extended periods of prosperity. The first period covered the twenties

and the early thirties and the second the sixties and the first half of the

seventies. Both periods correspond to periods of rapid growth in real gross

national product, the major determinant of the demand for legal services. The

length of these prosperous episodes appears due to the slow adjustment of

places in law schools. The slow supply adjustment causes the rate of return

to legal education to rise when demand increases and to remain above a normal

rate of return for extended periods of time. The existing stock of lawyers.

has gained from the slow supply response in the legal education industry.

A more rapid supply adjustment would shorten the number of periods when the

rate of return exceeded a normal return. Some tentative explanations for

the slow response have been considered. The slow response may be due in part

to the nonprofit character of the suppliers in the legal education industry.

Higher quality law schools act as if a high marginal tax rate is placed on the

net income of the school. In addition entry in the legal education sector

appears more difficult than in business education sector. These arguments

imply that the supply response would be faster if the legal education industry

was organized with profit maximizing suppliers or under the apprenticeship

system.

          The importance of cobweb oscillations in the market for lawyers can

be best assessed after study of an extended time series. During the last

fifty years the market for lawyers has been marked by two extended periods of

adjustment to long run equilibrium and one extended period in or near long run

equilibrium. Cob'web oscillations due at first to "too many" and then "too few"

lawyers do not describe the market for lawyers in the last fifty years. The

slow supply response and the ease with which lawyers may shift into other

occupations mitigate against cobweb type oscillations. While many believe

the number of lawyers is excessive, the historical evidence suggests that there

have been on balance too few lawyers. The current wave of warnings of a future

glut of lawyers should also be evaluated in light of the historical record.

          The findings of this study suggest the economic status of the legal

profession is closely tied to the performance of the economy and not to scale

of government regulation. Consequently, additions to the stock of lawyers

should decline in the future unless there is an unexpected increase in the

rate of economic growth. At the present time the earnings of lawyers appear

to be abnormally high. A decline in the relative earnings of lawyers may be

expected to accommodate the decline in the rate of growth of' lawyers.

probability   of passing the bar examination during the year. Suppose a

student graduates from law school. If the student passes the bar, the present

value of lawyer earnings (assuming infinite life) is:

where LE (assumed constant) equals the annual earnings of a lawyer. Define
 *
L   as the present value of taking the bar examination. Then the present value

of earnings for a student that fails the examination is:

       The present value of taking the bar examination is:

       Consider a student entering law school. If the student graduates from

law school, the present value of earnings is:

If the student drops out of law school after 2 years (virtually all dropouts
occur within the first two years), he receives:

        The present value of earnings for a student entering law school is:



(6a)
            (lr)*+ (i-) ((l+r) U(l+rh)2)

        In long   run   equilibrium the present value of not entering law school

                                  APPENDIX B


        Appendix   B displays lawyer income data from four different sources

and briefly describes the methods used to calculate long run equilibrium

earnings.



                   I. The Net Income and Earnings of Lawyers


        The net income data for lawyers for selected years is shown in Table Bi.

In 197)4 and 1953 the Department of Commerce estimates exceed the Internal Revenue

Service estimates (column (1) compared to column (5)) by about twenty-seven

percent. Median earnings reported in the 19)49 Census of Population are not out-

of-line with the 1949 Department of Commerce estimate of mean income, given the

skewness of lawyer income distribution.

        Column (6) displays the Internal Revenue Service estimate adjusted upward

by twenty-seven percent. The adjusted estimate in 1959 is less than the 1959

Census of Population estimate of mean earnings by 19 percent, a relatively large

amount, but exceeds the 1969 Census of Population estimate by only 4 percent.

While a changing proportional upward adjustment of the I.R.S. figures would have

been preferable to a fixed upward adjustment of 27 percent, the Census of

Population figures do not reveal a systematic upward or downward bias in the

adjusted I.R.S. estimates. Some further support for the upward adjustment

comes from a special tabulation of the 1971 income tax returns. For returns

with a Schedule C, the amount of other sources of income in 1971, e.g., wage

and salary income, was reported. If lawyers operating single proprietorships

also obtain considerable wage and salary income, the income estimates based

solely on the Schedule C reports will seriously underestimate total income from

        In 1971 Business Statistics reports the distribution of income for
returns with Schedule C. Adding wages and salaries reported, partnership income
and loss from proprietorships in other industries raises the reported income per
return to 22,7lO. This may overestimate the return from legal practice since
wages and salaries may include wages and salaries of other members of the
household.




                                                                                        .

legal   practice. When wages and salaries, partnership income and loss from

proprietorships in other industries are added to income reported on Schedule C,

the 1971 income per proprietor increases from $l)4,170 to *22,710. The income

per lawyer (including proprietors and partners) rises from *22,030 to $26,570

which is only 5 percent less than the 1971 adjusted value of $27,978. This

test also suggests the 27 percent upward adjustment is not in great error.

         The mean annual salaries of lawyers employed by firms in the private

sector reported by the Department of Labor (column (7)) are near the combined

I.R.S. estimate but less than the adjusted I.R.S. estimates and less than the

Census of Population estimates of earnings. The Census of Population figures

generally show the wage and salary income of wage and salary lawyers is less

than   the earnings of all lawyers and this may account for the lower salary
estimates reported by the Department of Labor.



             II.    The Calculation of Long Run Equilibrium Earnings


         The estimation of long run equilibrium contains the following steps.

The ratio of annual earnings of high school graduates to average annual earnings

of all full time working in private industry was regressed on time for selected

years when annual earnings of high school graduates was available (1939 in the

first such year). The coefficients of this regression equation were used to

convert the average annual earnings of full time workers in private industry

into estimated average annual earnings of high school graduates for the period

l925-194O   and   1951-1970.
                                         56


           The estimated annual earnings of high school graduates in each year

was multiplied by (i + r)ED     where ED represented a three year moving average

of the mean years beyond high school required for completion of law school.

The series for mean years beyond high school to complete law school was

obtained by taking a random sample of law school and calculating a mean value

for each year. The result of this product was then multiplied by
                                                                      II
(equation 7) where p equals the proportion passing the bar in t         and
equals the third year students in t - 1       divided by first year students in
t -   5.   h was arbitrarily set at .05 and r      .10 was considered a normal

rate of return on the investment in education.
