    "abstract": "\n\nThis essay discusses the reasons for and implications of the decline in real interest rates around the world over the past several decades. It suggests that the decline in interest rates is largely explicable from trends in saving, growth, and markups. In this environment, greater government debt is likely not problematic from a budgetary standpoint. But a Ponzi-like scheme of perpetual debt rollover might fail, and such a failure would make an already-bad state of the world even worse. In addition, even if a perpetual debt rollover succeeds, the increased debt could still crowd out capital, reducing labor productivity, real wages, and consumption.\n\n",
