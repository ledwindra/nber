                 The Term Structure of Euromarket Interest Rates:
                            An Empirical Investigation




                                     ABSTRACT


         This paper is an empirical investigation of the predictability and
    comovement of risk premia in the term structure of Euromarket interest
    rates. We show that variables which have been used as proxies for risk
    premia on uncovered foreign asset positions also predict excess returns in
    Euroniarket term structures, while variables which have been used as proxies
    for risk premia in the term structure also predict excess returns on taking
    uncovered foreign asset positions. These findings suggests that risk premia
    in the Euromarket term structures and on uncovered foreign asset positions
    move together. We test formally the hypothesis that risk premia on uncov-
    ered 3-month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposits move in proportion to a single
    latent variable. We are unable to reject this hypothesis. We are also
    unable to reject the hypothesis that the risk premia on these three strate-
    gies and those on rolling over 1-month Eurosterling (EuroDM) deposits versus
    holding a 3-month Eurosterlirig (EuroDN) deposit move in proportion to a
    single latent variable. The single latent variable model can be interpreted
    atheoretically, as a way of characterizing the extent to which predictable
   asset returns "move together"; or it can be interpreted as in Hansen and
   Hodrick (1983) and Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) as a specialization of the
   ICAPM in which assets have constant betas on a single, unobservable bench-
   mark portfolio.

                        AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION

I. Introduction

     There is by now a substantial body of empirical work on the predict-

ability of excess returns across assets of the same maturity denominated in

different currencies. Recent studies by Geweke and Feige (1979), Hansen and

Hodrick (1980, 1983), Cumby and Obstfeld (1981, 1982), Hakkio (1981a), and

Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) have rejected the "Fisher open" hypothesis

that interest rate differentials on assets of the same maturity denominated

in different currencies are offset by an expected exchange rate depreciation

and the hypothesis, equivalent given covered interest arbitrage, that

forward exchange rates are efficient predictors of future spot rates. The

source of these rejections is that information variables such as the

percentage forward premium [Hodrick and Srivastava (1983)) or lagged forward

rate forecast errors [Hansen and Hodrick (1980)] help to predict realized

excess returns on uncovered foreign asset positions.

     Hansen and Hodrick (1983) and Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) have tested

whether or not the time varying risk premia which separate the dollar prices

of 1-month forward contracts in several currencies from expected future spot

exchange rates are driven by a single latent variable. This latent variable

                                      1
                                                                               2

is interpreted in the context of the intertemporal capital asset pricing

model (ICAPM) as the expected dollar return on some benchmark portfolio in

excess of the nominally riskiess 1-month dollar rate) Hansen and Hodrick

(1983) were unable to reject the hypothesis that risk premia on 1-month yen,

mark, pound, Swiss franc, and French franc forward contracts all move in

proportion to a single latent variable. By contrast, using a somewhat

longer data series which included an additional twenty-one months of data

ending in September 1982, Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) rejected the single

latent variable model for the same five contracts.2

     The expectations theory of the term structure of 'on shore' U.S.

interest rates has also been rejected in recent empirical work. Shiller,

Campbell, and Schoenholtz (1983) and Mankiw and Summers (1984) have shown

that the spread between 6- and 3-month treasury bill rates has predictive

power for excess returns in the U.S. terni structure. Campbell (1985) has

decisively rejected the hypothesis that the time varying risk premia on

2-month treasury bills, bonds, and stocks over 1-month bills all move in

proportion to a single latent variable.

     This paper is an empirical investigation of the predictability and

comovement of risk premia in the term structure of Euromarket interest

rates. Our approach may be described as follows. We choose the dollar as

our numeraire currency and focus on four alternative strategies for obtain-

ing dollar payoffs three months hence. The first is to purchase a 3-month

Eurodollar deposit, a nominally riskless investment under our assumptions.

The second is to roll over 1-month Eurodollar deposits. The third is to

purchase a 3-month foreign currency Eurodeposit and to sell the proceeds

received three months hence at the then prevailing spot exchange rate. The
                                                                                3

 fourth is to purchase a 1-month foreign currency Eurodeposit, reinvest the

 proceeds in 1-month Eurodeposits in the same currency, and to sell the

 proceeds accumulated after three months at the then prevailing spot exchange

 rate. The difference in     Post excess returns on the latter two strategies

 is equal to the realized foreign currency return on holding a 3-month

 foreign currency Eurodeposit versus rolling over three 1-month deposits

 denominated in the same currency. Each of these latter three strategies

 generates a risky dollar payoff three months hence. We establish that the

excess returns on these risky strategies relative to the 3-month Eurodollar

deposit rate are predictable given information such as the spreads between

3- and 1-month Eurodeposit rates and the differentials between 3-month

foreign currency Eurodeposit rates and the 3-month Eurodollar rate. The

main task of the paper is to test whether or not the time varying risk

premia on each of these risky strategies move in proportion to a single

latent variable. This hypothesis can be interpreted atheoretically, as a

way of characterizing the extent to which predictable asset returns "move

together"; or it can be interpreted as in Hansen and Hodrick (1983) and

Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) as a specialization of the ICAPM in which

assets have constant betas on a single, unobservable benchmark portfolio.

The data are restricted in this framework with as few as two asset returns

and two information variables.

     The first contribution of this paper is to show that variables which

have been used as proxies for risk premia on uncovered foreign asset

positions also predict excess returns in at least two Euromarket term

structures. In addition, varia'bles which have been used as proxies for risk

premia in the term structure also predict excess returns on taking uncovered
                                                                              4

foreign asset positions. These findings suggest that risk premia in the

Euromarket term structures an on uncovered foreign asset positions move

together. We first test the hypothesis that risk premia on uncovered

3-month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposits and on rolling over 1-month versus

holding 3-month Eurodollar deposits move in proportion to a single latent

variable. We are unable to reject this hypothesis at standard levels of

significance. We next test whether or not the risk premia on these three

strategies and those on rolling over 1-month Eurosterling (EuroDM) deposits

versus holding a 3-month Eurosterling (EuroDM) deposits move in proportion

to a single latent variable. Again, we are unable to reject this hypothesis

at any reasonable level of significance.

     The plan of the paper is a.s follows. Section II discusses the data

series used and the construction and interpretation of the relevant excess

return variables. This section also shows how we construct proxies for risk

premia, and summarizes the behavior of these information variables over the

sample period. Section III provides an overview of the estimation and

testing strategies employed in the analysis. Section IV investigates the

existence and nature of predictable excess returns in the Eurodollar term

structure and on uncovered 3-month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposits. A

formal test of the proportionality of these predictable excess returns with

a single latent variable is presented. The section concludes with a similar

investigation of the predictability and coniovement of excess returns on

these three strategies and those on rolling over 1-month Eurosterling

(EuroDM) deposits versus holding a 3-month Eurosterling (EuroDM) deposit.

Section V provides some concluding remarks.

II. Construction and Interpretation of Variables

      The data set used in this paper consists of weekly observations on DM

and sterling spot exchange rates relative to the dollar, and on 1- and

3-month Eurodollar, EuroDM, and Eurosterling deposit rates.3 From these

data, we construct excess returns on three alternative investment strategies

relative to a baseline investment in a 3-month Eurodollar deposit. Each

alternative requires a dollar investment and yields a risky dollar payoff

after three months.

      The log of the 3-month gross return on the baseline investment, under-

taken at time t ,            is   log(l + R3(us)/400) where R3(us) is the
3-month Eurodollar deposit rate quoted in percentage points per year at time

t .   In   forming excess returns, we subtract log gross returns on alternative

investments from the baseline and simplify by using the approximation
                    4
log(l+x) — x
                         .
                .
                        Finally   we multiply by 400 to express excess returns in

units of percentage points per year.

      The first alternative investment strategy we consider is that of

rolling over 3 successive 1-month Eurodollar deposits. The log gross

return on this strategy is log[(1 + R1 t(us)/l200)(l +
                                                                Ri+1(us)/1200)
•(l + Rit+2(us)/1200)] .            The approximate excess return on the baseline

over the dollar rollover strategy, in percentage points per year, is


                                                    2
            A3'(us,us) —           R3 (u5) - (1/3) E R1+.(us)                       (1)
                                                   i—0


The rational expectation at time t of this excess return is called the

"rolling premium" on a 3-month Eurodollar deposit over 1-month Eurodollar

deposits [Campbell and Shiller (1984)]. According to the "pure expec-
                                                                                  6

tations theory" of the terni structure, the rolling premium is zero. A

slightly weaker hypothesis, which we call the "expectations theory" and test

in this paper, is that the rolling premium is constant through time at some

(possibly nonzero) level.

     The next set of alternative investments involves the purchase of a

3-month EuroDM or Eurosterling deposit. For example, dollars are used to

purchase DM at time t ;     the DM are invested in a 3-month EuroDM deposit:

and the DM proceeds are converted to dollars at the time t+3 spot exchange

rate, which is uncertain at time      •6 The log gross return on this

strategy is


          log[(l + R3(g)/4OO)S3(g)/S(g)]


where S(g) is the dollar price of DM at time t .         The approximate excess
return on the baseline over the 3-month DM strategy, in percentage points

per year, is



     3'3(us,g) —    R3(us)    -
                                  R3(g)   -
                                              400[log S3(g) - log S(gfl     (2)



The "Fisher open" hypothesis (uncovered interest parity) states that the

rational expectation of (2) at time t is zero, or at least constant

through time.

     Finally, we consider mixed strategies which involve rolling over

1-month EuroDM or Eurosterling deposits. Returns on these strategies are

uncertain both because future 1-month Eurodeposit rates are uncertain, and

because future spot exchange rates are uncertain.7 The log gross return on

a mixed DM strategy is
                                                                                                           7




The approximate excess return on the baseline over the mixed DM strategy, in

percentage points per year, is

The difference between (2') and (2) is just the excess return in the DM term

structure, the German equivalent of (1). In general we have,

          Recent theoretical work on asset pricing restricts the behavior of the

excess returns defined in equations (1), (2) arid (3). Formulated in

discrete time with a representative agent with time separable utility u

defined over consumption c          ,        the intertemporal capital asset pricing
models of Merton (1973), Lucas (1978, 1982), Breeden (1979), and Hansen,

Richard, and Singleton (1981) imply that for any asset i                          ,   the   gross
dollar return from time t to time t+n                    ,    1   + h'(i) ,       must satisfy the
first-order condition



               E{Qm(1 + h'(i))] —                1   .
                                                                                                    (4)

Here           denotes expectation conditional on the representative agent's

information set at time t               and                  is the marginal rate of substitu-

tion of dollars between t+n and t .           In   a one good world and in the

absence of cash-in-advance constraints

                     —   __________
                                                                                 (5)
                          U'(c t)Pt+n

where S is a discount factor and              is the dollar price of the consump-

tion good at date t (Hansen and Hodrick (1983) and Mark (1985)). In a

more complex model, with multiple goods or cash-in-advance constraints,

equation (5) would have to be generalized but a relation of the form (4)

would remain valid.

     In our context, (4) implies that, for example,


                (31) (us,g)]
                in
                                        — 0
          Et[Q+3A                                                                (6)



which is obtained by subtracting relation (4) for the DM rollover strategy

from relation (4) for the baseline Eurodollar investment strategy.

     Rearranging the expectation of the product into the sum of the covari-

ance and the product of expectations, (6) implies



          E[A3'(us,g)) — covt[Qt+3, 43'(us,g)]/E[Q÷3]                            (7)



Thus the risk premium is proportional to the conditional covariance of the

interteniporal marginal rate of substitution of dollars and the excess dollar

return on buying DM, rolling over 1-month EuroDM deposits, and selling the

accumulated proceeds back for dollars at the exchange rate prevailing three

months hence. The other risky returns studied in this paper are priced

analogously in the ICAPM framework.
                                                                                     9

        Now consider a "benchmark" portfolio defined to have nominal return


             (1 + h3(b)) Qt÷3/Et[(Q+3)2i                                       (8)



 Clearly, for any asset i


                   + h3(b))(1 + h3(i))) -
                                                l/Et[(Q+3)2J                   (9)



The nominally riskiess rate must obey (1 +                                    SO
                                                R3 (us))      1/E[Q' t+31 '
that



        E{(l + h3(b))(l + h3(i))] — (1 + R3 t(u5))E(1 + h3(b))                (10)


This can be rewritten as



        R3(us) -   E[h3(i)J    —
                                   cov[h3(i),   h3(b)]/E {(1 + h3b))]         (11)



This relationship must hold for h3(i) —
                                                h3(b)   ,   so we can substitute

out E{l + h3(b)] to obtain


            R3(us) -   E[h3(i))       1ER3(us) -        Eh3(b)I               (12)


or in more compact notation,



            E[A3(i)) -

where
               covt[h3(i), h(b)]/var [h3(b)] —     cov[A3(i),
                            Thus, the expected dollar excess return on asset

i is proportional to the expected excess return on a benchmark portfolio

whose payoff is perfectly conditionally correlated with the intertemporal
                                                                                  10

marginal rate of substitution of dollars. Although the betas        can in

general vary over time, our econometric work will test restrictions implied

by constant betas. As pointed out by Hansen and Hodrick (1983), such tests

are not tests of a fully specified general equilibriun model, but are tests

of proportional co-movement of expected excess returns which are motivated

by the ICAPM.

     In Section IV, we test the hypotheses that the rational expectations of

excess returns are constant through time by regressing excess returns on a

constant and "information variables" which are known at time t ,   and

testing the joint significance of the information variable coefficients.

     If such tests are to be powerful against a broad range of alterna-

tives, the information variables used should be ones which plausibly predict

excess returns when the expectations and Fisher open hypotheses are false.

Some authors have used lagged excess returns [Hansen and Hodrick (1980)],

thereby conducting a "weak-form" test. We adopt a different approach, using

as information variables elements of excess returns themselves, as defined

in equations (1), (2) and (3), which are known at time t

     The element of (1) which we use for our tests is R3(us) -
                                                                   R1(us)

linear approximation for the term structure, the Eurodollar spread can be

 When the expectations theory of the term structure holds, the first term on

 the right hand side of (13) is a constant;        unusually high longer term
 interest rates are then due entirely to expectations of short rate in-

 creases. However if there is any variation in the rolling premium, it will

be reflected in the spread so that this variable should be a good instrument

 for our empirical work.

     The element of (2) we use is         R3(us) -                  the   interest
                                                      R3
differential between 3-month Eurodollar and EuroDM and Eurosterling rates.8

Following Fama (1984), we can decompose this variable into the sum of the

cross-currency risk premium, and the expected rate of depreciation of the
dollar relative to currency j



R3(us) -   R3(i) — EA33)(us,j)        +
                                          4OO[E log S3(j) - log S(j)] . (14)

When uncovered interest parity holds, the first term on the right hand side

of (14) is constant, and unusually high differentials are then due entirely

to expected dollar depreciation. However in general variation in the cross-

currency risk premium will be reflected in the differential, so this is also

a good instrument for our purposes.

     One final set of information variables corresponds to equation (3). We

include foreign currency term structure spreads,     R3(i) -                which
                                                               R1
can be decomposed in the manner of equation (l3).

     If our tests are to be powerful, it is also desirable that our informa-

tion variables should not be too highly correlated.         The inclusion of

variables which are highly collinear with other instruments is likely to use

up degrees of freedom in estimation and testing, without contributing to the

predictability of returns. To check for this, and to review the behavior of
                                                                                 12

interest rates over our sample, we present summary statistics for informa-

tion variables in Table 1.

     The first row of Table 1 reports the mean Eurodollar spread, the mean

differentials between 3-month Eurodollar and foreign currency rates, and the

mean foreign currency spreads. Mean spreads in all currencies are positive

but small, ranging from just over 5 basis points in the UK to almost 13

basis points in Germany.       The mean Eurodollar rate is more than 420 basis

points higher than the mean EuroDM rate, but almost 175 basis points lower

than the mean Eurosterling rate. The second row of Table 1 reports standard

deviations, which are all quite large relative to the nieans)°

     The bottom panel of Table 1 shows the correlations of the various

instruments. The highest correlation, 0.646, is between the two      differen-
tials; evidently movements in US interest rates relative to the other two

currencies account for a large part of the variation in the differentials.

There are positive but fairly small correlations among the spreads in all

three currencies. None of the correlations are high enough to suggest that

we should drop any of our information variables.



III. EcrQmetric Issues

     Most of the empirical work of this paper is conducted within a standard

regression framework.       The major econometric difficulty in our application

is one which is by now familiar from the work of Hansen and Hodrick (1980)

and others; we have weekly observations but a 3-month (13-week) holding

period, so the error terms in our regressions follow an MA-12 process under
                       11
the null hypothesis.
                                                                                                     13
         Serial   correlation in the equation error does not affect the consis-

 tency of OLS coefficient estimates, T but it does require an
 adjustment in the estimated variance-covariance matrix of these estimates.

 Hansen and Hodrick (1980), following Hansen (1979), propose the following

 consistent estimator of the variance-covariance matrix of                          -
                                                                                        bT)

             0                                     .
                                                                                              (19)

 Here            is the matrix of independent variables at sample size T ,                    and
 the ()th element of
                               T WT(1,j) ,                  is   defined by

             A                  T     A    A

             w(1j)       (l/T) E uu - k for k
                              t—k+l
                                                                 n

                        —0
                                                   otherwise,


where k —        i-j   and n — 12         (the order of the MA process).

        The above estimator does not allow for conditional heteroskedasticity

in the error terni, but it is straightforward to do so, using the method of

White (1984) and following Hsieh (1984) and Cuniby and Obstfeld (1984), by

redefining w(i.j) —             for k n and — 0
                          uu                                      otherwise.

        One problem with both Hansen and Hodrick's estimator and its hetero-

skedasticity-consistent variant, is that                         need not be positive definite
in finite samples.        Thus use of          8       in   practice may result in negative
"CM-squared" test statistics or even negative standard
                                                                          errors; problems may
also arise with nonlinear iterative estimation methods of the type we use to

estimate the latent variable models.

    Newey and West (1985) propose a simple modification of                              which is
consistent and constructed to be positive definite.                       Allowing for condi-
                                                                                                  14

tional   heteroskedasticity, this is cz)T(i,j)      y(k,m)uu.         for k        in   ;   and

= 0 otherwise, where -y(k,m)      1 -   (k/(m+1))   and in       -     as   T -,        ,   but
no faster than the fourth root of T

      Newey and West's estimator achieves positive definiteness by down-

weighting the higher-order autocovariances of                ,       and consistency by
                                                       u.r

reducing the downweighting as       T     increases.     We were conservative in

applying this estimator, choosing in       2n for our fixed sample size so that

the first 12 autocovariances- -those which are nonzero under the null- -all

received weights of at least 1/2.        In general, for this choice of                     in



Newey and West's estimator gave us standard errors which were at least as

large as any of the alternatives discussed above.'2

      When we come to estimate restricted single latent variable models, we

use   the   Generalized Method of Moments procedure (Hansen (1982), Hansen and

Singleton (1982)), which allows for the presence of conditional heteroske-

dasticity.      This is important because in the ICAPM variations in expected

returns on the benchmark portfolio will generally be associated with

variations in the conditional covariance matrix of excess returns. We use

Hansen's Chi-square statistic to test the nonlinear cross-equation restric-

tions of the model. We again employ Newey and West's procedure to construct

the optimal weighting matrix for the GMM estimation.



IV. Empirical Results

      Tables 2, 3, and 5 present regression results which establish the

predictability of excess returns in the Eurodollar term structure and on

uncovered investments in 3-month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposits.                          The

sample period is 1976:1 through 1982:52. The top half of Table 1 shows that
                                                                               15
 these   excess returns do not exhibit first-order serial correlation, thus

 passing the simplest "weak form" efficient markets test.13      However, as
 indicated in the bottom half of Table 2, the spread between the 3- and

 1-month Eurodollar rate has significant explanatory power for realized

 excess returns in the Eurodollar term structure, and the spread between the

 3-month Eurodollar rate and the 3-month Eurosterling rate      (to a close
approximation, the percentage forward premium on sterling) helps predict

realized excess returns on uncovered 3-month Eurosterling deposits. Similar

findings are reported in Hakkio and Leiderman (1984) who test, and reject,

the hypothesis that expected excess returns in the Eurodollar, EuroDM, and

Eurosterling markets are constant.

     More interesting are the results of Table 3. The top row demonstrates

that the spreads between the 3-month Eurodollar rate and the 3-month EuroDM

and Eurosterling rates jointly have incremental predictive content for

excess returns in the Eurodollar term structure after allowing for the

information contained in the spread between the 3- and 1-month Eurodollar

rate. The bottom row of Table 3 shows that the spread between the 3-month

and 1-month Eurodollar rate has significant explanatory power for realized

excess returns on uncovered Eurosterling deposits as do the differentials

between the 3-month Eurodollar rate and the 3-month EuroDM and Euro-

sterling deposit rates.    Tables 2 and 3 also indicate that none of the

aforementioned variables predict realized excess returns on uncovered EuroDM

deposits.    However, as shown in the second row of Table 5, the spreads

between 3- and 1-month EuroDM and Eurosterling deposit rates both have

significant explanatory power for excess returns on uncovered 3-month EuroDM

deposits. To summarize, variables which have been used as proxies for risk
                                                                               16

premia   on uncovered foreign asset positions also predict excess returns in

the Eurodollar term structure, while variables which have been used as

proxies for risk premia in the term structure also predict excess returns on

taking uncovered foreign asset positions.

     These findings suggest that risk premia in the Eurodollar term struc-

ture and on uncovered foreign asset positions move together. We now test

formally the hypothesis that risk premia on uncovered 3-month EuroDM and

Eurosterling deposits and on rolling over 1-month versus holding 3-month

Eurodollar deposits move in proportion to a single latent variable.

     As discussed in Section II, the ICAPM places the following restrictions

on the excess returnof a particular asset i



           E[A3(i)Ix] —   fi.E[)3(b)Ix]                                 (16)



This equation is derived by projecting equation (12) onto a k-vector   x of
information variables, a subset of the market's full information set. The

first element of x is just a constant.              is the "beta" of excess

return i with the benchmark portfolio, defined as in equation (12) but now

assumed to be constant through time.    Since the expected excess return on

the benchmark portfolio is unobservable, we substitute the best linear

projection of this excess return on the variables in x ,    i.e.,

           E[A3(b)fx] —   a'x   .
                                                                        (17)


     Consider now the implications of (16) and (17) for the system of p

regression equations


           A—x+v                                                        (18)
                                                                                    17




 where    A   is a p-vector of excess returns, '      is a p by k matrix of
 regression coefficients with typical element         ,    and   V iS a p-vector
 of forecast errors which is orthogonal to

        The model (16) and (17) imposes a single latent variable structure on

 (18), restricting                      is normalized to unity so the first row
                            8a
 of       estimates the a coefficients, the first column estimates the other

 fi    coefficients and the lower right hand block is restricted. Thus there
 are     (p-l)(k-l)   restrictions, which force expected excess returns on all

 assets to move in proportion with one another.

        Table 4 presents parameter estimates of the       a's and fl's    and the

test statistic for the hypothesis that the restrictions on               apply to

the system of regression equations in Table 3.        The information variables

       are a constant, the spread between the 3- and 1-month Eurodollar rate

and the spreads between the 3-month Eurodollar rate and the 3-month EuroDM

and Eurosterling rates.       The restrictions of the single latent variable

model cannot be rejected at any reasonable level of significance:        a x(6)
value of at least 7.323 would occur 29.2% of the time under the null.

       Close inspection of Tables 2 and 3 reveals why we obtain this result.

The key excess returns are A(31) (us,us)        and A(33) (us,uk)     which are
predictable in Table 3. The a coefficients in Table 4 are quite close to

the unconstrained regression coefficients of A3'(us,us) in the first
row of Table 3.       The constrained system must then fit A3'3(us,uk) to

this vector of coefficients, multiplied by some scalar.            The choice of

fl3    -1.193 generates a vector of coefficients for A3'3(us,uk) which
has the same sigr pattern as the unconstrained coefficients, although a
                                                                                     18

 smaller magnitude. The system estimates the a coefficients quite precise-

 ly, but the standard errors of the fl's are large relative to their point
           14
 estimates.

     Table 4 also reports the correlations of the estimated latent variable

with each of the instruments.       Even though the latent variable has been

 arbitrarily normalized by setting fl1 — 1      ,   the same correlations (up to a
possible sign change) would be obtained by any other normalization given the

estimated coefficients of Table 4.     The estimated latent variable is most

strongly correlated with the Eurodollar spread, at 0.697, but is also quite

highly correlated with the two differentials.

     In Tables 5 to 7 we repeat the above analysis for a large system of

excess returns and information variables. The vector of excess returns is

expanded to include the foreign term structure excess returns

and ).3'(uk,uk) .       We   work with these excess returns, rather than the

excess returns on ttmixed investment strategies defined in equation (2'),
for several reasons.   First, the foreign term structure excess returns are

more directly comparable with excess returns in the domestic term structure.

Secondly, the variance of exchange rate changes, and therefore of cross-

currency excess returns, is much greater than the variance of 1-month

interest rate changes which lead to term structure excess returns. (This can

be seen in the table of summary statistics following Table 5.) When the two

types of excess return are combined in a "mixed" excess return, the cross-
                             *
currency excess return dominates;       (3,1)       .
                                                (us,j)   and    (33) (us,j)   are
                                      )'

almost perfectly collinear. Finally, even though the foreign term structure

excess returns are not excess returns on dollar investments relative to a

dollar benchmark, they are the differences between two dollar excess returns
                                                                                   19

 and thus, under the null hypothesis, obey the linear restrictions implied by

 the single latent variable model stated above.

       Corresponding to the foreign term structure excess returns, we now

 include foreign terni structure spreads in our vector of information vari-

 ables along with the dollar spread and the cross-currency interest differen-

 tials.

       Regression results for the larger system are presented in Table 5. The

two new information variables have considerable explanatory power for

cross-currency excess returns on 3-month Eurodeposits, so that the excess

return on the 3-month EuroDM investment strategy is now predictable
                                                                         along
with the other excess returns.       The excess return in the EuroDM term

structure is highly predictable; by contrast the expectations theory of the

term structure cannot be rejected in the Eurosterling term structure.         In

general there appear to be important cross-effects which suggest that once

again a single latent variable model might fit the data well.

       In Table 6 we test and are unable to reject the hypothesis that a

single latent variable explains the results of Table 5.      Once again the

coefficients are estimated precisely relative to the    fi   coefficients,   but
the point estimates of the     8's   generally imply reduced-form regression

coefficients which match the sign pattern of the most significant uncon-

strained coefficients. The new       coefficients for foreign term structure

spreads are estimated quite close to unity, although these estimates seem to

be somewhat sensitive to the choice of starting values for the GMM proced-

ure.

       Finally, in Table 7 we shrink the model to the first three rows of

Table 5, in order to compare the results with those of Table 4 which used
                                                                               20

the same set of excess returns, and in order to check the robustness of the

latent variable model to changes in the estimated system.     Once again the

model seems to fit the data quite well; higher test Statistics would be

obtained under the null 19.5% of the time.      In both Tables 5 and 6 the

estimated latent variable continues to have a high correlation of around 0.7

with the Eurodollar spread.



VI. Conclusion

     In this paper we document the existence of predictable time-varying

excess returns on a variety of investment strategies, relative to a 3-month

Eurodollar investment. The strategies we consider involve three currencies

--the dollar, the DM and the pound sterling- -and two maturities--3- and

1-month Eurodeposits.

     We find not only that excess returns are predictable, but that there

are important cross-effects.    Variables which traditionally are used to

predict term structure excess returns also have explanatory power for

cross-currency excess returns, and vice versa. In fact a tightly specified

model, constraining all expected excess returns to move in proportion with a

single latent variable, cannot be rejected at any reasonable significance

level in a variety of tests. The estimated latent variable is quite highly

correlated with the spread between 3- and 1-month Eurodollar interest rates.

     Our favorable results for the single latent variable model contrast

with the rejections reported by Campbell (1985) for US domestic assets and

by Hodrick and Srivastava (1984) for Eurocurrency assets. However Gibbons

and Fersori (1985) and Hansen and Hodrick (1983), wrking with domestic and

Eurocurrency data respectively, also failed to reject the model.         An
                                                                                 21
important    topic for future research is to sort out these apparently con-

flicting results.      It does seem to be the case that rejections occur when

more heterogeneous assets are studied, and when a longer sample period is
used.      Slow changes through time in relative betas of assets with widely

divergent characteristics might explain this pattern of results.      Our work

should not be taken to imply that betas are constant for all assets in all

sample periods, but merely as evidence that a simple latent variable
structure describes our data.

        These results are preliminary to a more structural investigation of the

sources of predictable excess returns across currencies and maturities. If

indeed predictable excess returns are driven by a single underlying latent

variable, it seems plausible that conditional second moments of returns also

move with this variable. We hope to explore the interrelationship between

conditional first and second moments of returns in future work.

                                 FOOTNOTES


1.   However, as Hansen and Hodrick (1983) and Hodrick and Srivastava (1983)
     are careful to point out, their approach to modelling is best construed
     as an interpretation of a parsimonious statistical representation of
     risk premia using intertemporal capital asset pricing theory.        In
     particular, their statistical tests are not tests of a fully specified
     equilibrium model.

2.   Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) also employ non-overlapping data.
     However their rejection of the single latent variable model is not due
     to their different sample procedure.

3.   We are grateful to Richard Levich for supplying us with these data,
     derived originally from Harris Bank sources.       The data set also
     includes forward exchange rates and 6 and 12 month Eurodeposit interest
     rates, which we do not use here.

4.   This approximation is commonly used in empirical work on the term
     structure (Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz (1983), Mankiw and Summers
     (1984)).   For the short 3-month holding period considered in this
     paper, the approximation is extremely accurate since gross returns are
     very close to one when measured in natural units.

5.   Campbell and Shiller also discuss the "holding premium" on a long-term
     investment, sold before maturity, relative to a short-term investment.
     We do not consider holding premia in this paper since Eurodeposits are
     generally non-negotiable and must be held to maturity.

6.   It would also be possible to arrange at time t to convert the DM back
     to dollars at a known forward exchange rate.       This would give a
     riskiess 3-month dollar return which by arbitrage ("covered interest
     parity") is always very close to the 3-month Eurodollar rate. Small
     deviations from covered interest parity in the Euromarkets appear to
     arise from transactions costs.

7.   Note that it would not be possible to fully hedge the exchange risk of
     a mixed strategy by engaging in a forward exchange transaction. This
     is because the number of DM which must be converted back to dollars at
     time t+3 depends on future 1-month DM rates, and thus is not known at
     time t.

8.   By covered interest parity, the interest differential is also the
     forward premium (400 times the log of the ratio of the 3-month ahead
     forward rate quoted at time t  , to the time t spot rate).
9.   The decompositions of (17) and (18) help to account for the fact that
     spreads and differentials have been used to obtain powerful rejections
     of the expectations and Fisher open hypotheses, as documented in the
     introduction to the paper.
                                                                           30

10. All the information variables have a fairly high degree of serial
    correlation, so the standard deviations should not be interpreted as if
    they come from independently and identically distributed variables.

11. This statement is true for regressions with cross-currency excess re-
     turns (2) as the dependent variable. With term structure excess re-
     turns (1) or (3) as the dependent variable, uncertainty is resolved
     after 2 months when the 2-month ahead 1-month Eurodollar rate becoses
     known, so the error process is only MA-8. We ignore this in our empi-
     rical work, thus obtaining conservative estimates of standard errors.

12. Alternative methods for constructing a positive definite T matrix
    have been developed by Hansen (1982) and Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld
    (1983).   However we found Newey and West's approach to be easier to
    apply.

13. However, for all three excess return, we can rejects at the 5% level
     the hypothesis that the first six autocovariances are jointly zero.

14. Point estimates of some of the coefficients in Table 3 are sensitive to
    the starting values used in the estimation, because these starting
    values help to determine the first-round weighting matrix in the GMM
