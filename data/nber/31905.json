    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper describes an emerging literature in economics that aims to merge macro issues of structural change and growth with micro data and analysis. This literature focuses on a set of related patterns of change that accompany the processes of growth and development. Traditionally, the focus has been on industrialization \u2013 and more broadly the reallocation of employment and economic activity from agriculture to manufacturing and services. The new literature considers a broader set of transformations: from rural to urban, from home to market (and from market to home), from informal to formal, and from self-employment to wage work. Drawing on new data sources, including micro data and administrative records, the literature tries to understand the complex interactions of a broad set of market failures, policy distortions, and impediments to the growth process. In broadening the understanding of structural transformation \u2013 to encompass processes beyond industrialization \u2013 this literature opens the door to a richer understanding of the processes of growth and a wider set of potential levers for policy.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nThis paper benefited from the comments of Cheryl Doss and two anonymous referees. Our views on these topics have been shaped by many colleagues and co-authors over the years. We particularly acknowledge, without implicating, Paco Buera, David Lagakos, Mart\u00ed Mestieri, Rachel Ngai, Stephen Parente, Richard Rogerson, Yongs Shin, and Akos Valentinyi. With sadness, we also note our intellectual debts to our late friend and colleague, Berthold Herrendorf. Berthold brought tremendous clarity and insight to every discussion, as well as humour and curiosity. His untimely death in 2022 was a loss to all of us working in the field. We gratefully acknowledge support for this work \u2013 and for the broader research programme on Structural Transformation and Economic Growth (STEG) \u2013 from the United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), as part of the UK aid effort. Colleagues at FCDO, and particularly Andy Hinsley and John Piper, have encouraged us to articulate our thinking about structural transformation and its relationship with economic growth. Finally, we would not have completed this paper without the constant encouragement of Tessa Ogden, Ed Sellers, and Sarah Pogrund at CEPR. We are truly appreciative. The views expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\n\n"
