    "abstract": "\n\nEuropean unemployment has been steadily increasing for the last 15 years and is\nexpected to remain very high for many years to come. In this paper, we argue that\nthis fact implies that shocks have much more persistent effects on unemployment than\nstandard theories can possibly explain. We develop a theory which can explain such\npersistence, and which is based on the distinction between insiders and outsiders in\nwage bargaining. We argue that if wages are largely set by bargaining between\ninsiders and firms, shocks which affect actual unemployment tend also to affect\nequilibrium unemployment. We then confront the theory to both the detailed facts of\nthe European situation as well as to earlier periods of high persistent unemployment\nsuch as the Great Depression in the US.\n\n",
