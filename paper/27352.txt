Inflation with Covid Consumption Baskets

JEL No. C43,E21,E31
ABSTRACT
The Covid-19 Pandemic has led to changes in consumer expenditure patterns that can introduce
significant bias in the measurement of inflation. I use data collected from credit and debit
transactions in the US to update the official basket weights and estimate the impact on the
Consumer Price Index (CPI). I find that the Covid inflation rate is higher than the official CPI in
the US, for both headline and core indices. I also find similar results with Covid baskets in 10 out
of 16 additional countries. The difference is significant and growing over time, as socialdistancing rules and behaviors are making consumers spend relatively more on food and other
categories with rising inflation, and relatively less on transportation and other categories
experiencing significant deflation.

Introduction

The Covid-19 Pandemic has led to lockdowns, mobility restrictions, and social-distancing rules
that are dramatically changing consumer expenditure patterns in many countries.1 In particular, consumers are spending less on transportation, hotels, restaurants, and recreation, while
expenditures on food and other groceries have increased in both absolute and relative terms.
These sudden changes in expenditure patterns can introduce significant biases in the Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) used to measure inflation, as noted by Diewert and Fox (2020). Most
National Statistical Offices (NSOs) update their CPI expenditure weights once a year, often with
lagged expenditure data. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), for example, updated the
weights in December 2019 using expenditure information collected back in 2017-2018.2 While
this practice may be reasonable in normal times, it makes inflation indices much harder to interpret during the Pandemic, as recently noted by central bankers such as Tenreyro (2020) and
Lane (2020).
In this paper, I empirically study the impact that changes in expenditure patterns are having
on the measurement of CPI inflation in 18 countries. I use high-frequency estimates of spending
based on transactional data to build updated CPI weights and compute alternative “Covid
Basket” price indices.
I start with the US, where card-based expenditure data are publicly available as part of the
Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker at Harvard and Brown University, described in Chetty et
al. (2020). I first show that headline Covid inflation is higher than what the CPI reflects. By May
2020, the annual inflation rate of the US Covid index was 0.95%, compared to only 0.13% of the
equivalent CPI (all-items, US city average, not seasonally adjusted). The difference is significant
and growing over time, as new social-distancing rules and preferences prevent consumer spending
in categories that are experiencing deflation, such as transportation, and induce more expenditure
in food and other groceries, where prices are increasing over time. I also find similar results when
I focus on the Core CPI, implying that the bias is not limited to consumer spending on food

Most NSOs compute a Lowe Index formula at upper levels of aggregation. This introduces small adjustments
that account for relative price changes across categories every month, but they have little impact on the basket
weights because quantities are assumed to be fixed. See Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020) for an archive of BLS
weights over time.

and energy. Furthermore, I show that low-income households are experiencing more inflation
during the crisis, with an annual inflation rate of 1.12% in May 2020, compared to just 0.57%
for high-income households.
Next, I estimate the impact in 17 additional countries. To build a unique Covid basket for
each country, I update the official CPI weights with the same relative changes across categories
observed in the US. Consistent with the previous results, I find that in 12 countries the Covid
inflation rate is higher than that of the official CPI. In the other 5 cases, however, the inflation
rate is lower, highlighting the fact that the CPI bias can go in any direction, depending not only
on the changes in the basket weights but also on the inflation rates experienced by each CPI
subcategory.
My results have important implications for policy-makers trying to respond to the crisis.
They suggest that the cost of living for consumers is higher than estimated by the official CPI,
especially for low-income consumers. The welfare effects are particularly relevant during this
crisis, where a large share of the population is becoming unemployed. My results also highlight
the divergence in sectoral inflation rates that reflect different demand and supply shocks across
categories in many countries. This particular behavior of prices during the Pandemic tends to
amplify the CPI bias emphasized in this paper.

Data and Methodology

To build the “Covid Basket,” I start with daily measures of the change in US consumption patterns since January 2020, available at the Opportunity Insights (OI) Tracker3 . These estimates,
shown in Figure 1, are produced using transactional data collected from credit and debit card
transactions in the US, as described by Chetty et al. (2020).

Figure 1: Changes in US Consumer Spending During the Pandemic
Notes: This graph shows the cumulative expenditure change across categories of goods and services in the US since
January 2020. These estimates are computed by Chetty et al. (2020) using data collected from credit and debit card
transactions. The data is publicly available at the Opportunity Insights (OI) website (opportunityinsights.org).

I combine these estimates with official CPI data from January 2019 to May 2020, obtained
from the official NSO in each country, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US. In
most cases, I use the CPI sector series that form the first level of disaggregation of the headline
CPI (all-items, not-seasonally adjusted), as well as the latest available weights in the official CPI
basket.
The matching of the OI categories with the CPI sectors requires some assumptions, as detailed
in the Appendix. To improve the correspondence, I split the CPI for “Food and Beverages” into
three additional subcategories. About six categories are then closely matched in both datasets.
For “Food at Home” and “Alcoholic Beverages,” I use the OI “Grocery” category. For “Food
Away from Home,” I use the OI category for “Restaurants and Hotels.” For “Other Goods and
Services,” I assume that the expenditure changes are equal to those of the whole OI basket.
Finally, for “Housing” and “Education and Communication,” I assume that expenditures in
these categories have not changed, which seems a reasonable assumption during the first months

3

of the Pandemic.
To estimate the expenditure shares in the Covid basket, I start with the latest official CPI
weights and multiply them by the average percentage change in the corresponding expenditure
category each month. The new weights are then re-computed as a share of the total, to account
for the fact that total expenditure is also falling over time.
Formally, the Covid weights are given by:
si ∆ei
P i Qi
sit = P t i t i = P 0 i i
i P t Qt
i s0 ∆e
where Pti and Qit are the prices and quantities of CPI category i at time t, and ∆ei =

(1)
Pti Qit
P0i Qi0

is

the change in expenditure. Equation 1 highlights the fact that these are relative weights, so the
importance of a category in the basket can change even when its expenditure is not affected.
Finally, the CPI and Covid price indices are computed using the weighted sum of the changes
in the official CPI sectoral indices, using weights si0 and sit , respectively. Note the fixed-basket
CPI is Laspeyres index, which traditionally results in higher inflation because it does not allow for
the possibility that consumers shift their spending away from categories experiencing relatively
more inflation. By using more current expenditure weights in the Covid Index, I am allowing
for this possibility, which makes my results with the Covid basket more surprising.4

Impact on US Inflation

In this section, I focus on the US, where detailed high-frequency Covid expenditure estimates
are publicly available. I first look at the impact on the all-items CPI, expand the results to the
Core CPI, and discuss some policy and welfare implications comparing results for both low and
high-income consumers.

3.1

All-items CPI

The all-items CPI for urban consumers (CPI-U) is the main “headline” measure of inflation in
the US. Table 1 shows the impact that the changes in expenditure shares across categories had
4

The Covid index is not a Paasche index because I am not fixing the basket weights to the last period. Instead,
my method is closer to the ”Chained CPI” produced by the BLS (C-CPI-U). Unfortunately, the BLS can only update
expenditure weights gradually, which results in a preliminary C-CPI-U index that does not fully reflect spending
patterns until a year later, when a final version is published. In fact, in the Appendix I show that the C-CPI-U has
had less inflation during the Pandemic than the CPI-U, the benchmark all-items CPI used in this paper.

adjusted CPI, and an equivalent index constructed using estimates of the consumption expenditure shares during
the Covid Pandemic.

on this index for every month since the Pandemic started.
As expected, the CPI and Covid CPI have nearly identical monthly inflation rates in January
and February because there were no significant expenditure differences. By March, when the
Pandemic hit the US, both indices started showing significant deflation. But the Covid index
had only half the deflation shown by the fixed-basket CPI. In April, the difference became larger,
with the Covid CPI falling by only -0.09% compared to a fall of -0.69% in the CPI. In fact, that
month the trend in the Covid CPI was already rebounding. In May, the Covid CPI has a positive
inflation rate, while the CPI was still experiencing some deflation.
Although the magnitude of the bias changes over time, every single month has added more
inflation to the Covid index, so that the impact on the annual inflation rate is already significant,
as shown in the last two columns of Table 1. By May, the Covid index was experiencing an annual
inflation rate equal to 0.95% compared to just 0.13% in the official CPI.
To understand why the Covid index has more inflation, consider the CPI patterns and weights
shown in Table 2 for the month of April 2020, when the difference was largest. The first column
shows a comprehensive list of all the CPI categories that compose the all-items index. The
second column shows the monthly CPI sector inflation for that month. The third and fourth
columns show the CPI and Covid weights. Finally, the last two columns show the incidence that
each category has on the total inflation rate. The incidence is simply the monthly inflation rate
multiplied by the weight, and the sum of all the numbers in the last two columns equals the
-0.69% and -0.09% monthly inflation rates for CPI and Covid CPI during the month of April.

Table 2: US CPI Weights and Incidence - April 2020
Notes: The CPI weight is the share of expenditure in a given category over total expenditures. Note that categories
that experience no change in spending over time can have higher Covid weights as a share of the decreasing total
expenditure basket. The incidence is the monthly inflation rate multiplied by the weight. The sum of all the category
incidence numbers is equal to the monthly inflation rate.

Table 2 shows that the US Covid inflation rate was higher in April because there was more
weight in categories that had a positive inflation rate, and less weight in categories experiencing
significant deflation. In particular, the weight for “Food at Home” rose from 7.58% to 11.28%,
increasing the incidence of this category by 0.1%. At the same time, the weight for “Transportation” fell from 15.74% to 6.25%, increasing the incidence on the total monthly inflation
rate by about 0.47%. The weights of “Housing” and “Education and Communication” also rose
significantly. However, these two categories had little impact on Covid inflation so far because
their sectoral inflation rates are close to zero.

3.2

Core CPI

Although most of the difference comes from the changes in spending on food and fuel, a similar
bias is present in the Core CPI index that excludes these categories, as shown in the Appendix.
By May, the Core Covid annual inflation rate was 1.59% compared to the 1.20% in the official
Core index.5
Why does the Core CPI have more inflation with a Covid basket, even after food and energy
5

To build the Core indices, I dropped all food CPI series and further split the “Housing” and “Transportation”
series to remove their energy components. I also made similar assumptions for the consumer spending patterns at
the category level, with details provided in the Appendix.

6

are excluded? The reason is that there is less spending weight in non-energy transportation
subcategories with significant deflation, such as “Public Transportation” and “New and Used
Motor Vehicles.” Detailed spending patterns for these categories are not available, but Figure 1
shows the share of U.S. consumer spending in the broader “Transportation” sector is taking
longer to recover that in other categories, suggesting that while the magnitude of the bias is
smaller with the Core CPI, its effects may end up being more persistent over time.

3.3

Income Levels and Policy Implications

These findings imply that the cost of living for consumers is rising faster during the Covid crisis.
This can, in turn, have important welfare implications across different income groups. A large
literature has studied how inflation varies across income levels. Earlier papers by Michael (1979),
Hagemann (1982), Hobijn and Lagakos (2005) focused on differences in expenditures at upper
levels of aggregation. More recently, papers with scanner data such as Kaplan and SchulhoferWohl (2017), Jaravel (2019), and Argente and Lee (2017) have emphasized additional mechanisms
that affect the inflation experienced by low-income households within narrow categories of goods.
In particular, Jaravel (2019) found that annual inflation in the US for households in the bottom
income quintile was on average nearly 0.4% higher for the period 2004-2015.
To explore the impact that the Covid crisis is having on the inflation rate experienced by
different households, I use data from the 2018 BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) to
build upper-level expenditure weights for the lowest and highest quintiles of the household income
distribution. I then update these weights using monthly spending for equivalent income quintiles
provided by Opportunity Insights. More details on the construction of these weights are provided
in the Appendix.
Figure 2 shows the annual inflation rate for the income-level indices, as well as the benchmark
official and Covid CPIs. During 2019, low-income households were already experiencing more
inflation due to the fact that they spend relatively more on food. After March 2020, the Pandemic
exacerbated the difference. Using Covid weights, the low-income households had an annual
inflation rate of 1.12% in May 2020, compared to just 0.57% for high income households.
The changes in consumption patterns during Covid increased the inflation rate for both
income groups, but the fact that low-income households spend relatively more on food than in

7

transportation has exacerbated the difference in inflation rates during the first months of the
crisis.6 A complete welfare calculation requires knowing the persistence of these effects and the
changes in incomes during the crisis, but as far as inflation is concerned, real consumption for

Figure 2: US Annual Inflation with Covid Expenditure Baskets
Notes: The CPI and Covid CPI are plots of the same indices shown in Table 1. The Covid Low (High) Income index
uses CEX expenditure weights for households in the lowest (highest) quintile of the income distribution. These
weights remain constant for 2019, and after January 2020, are updated using the changes in spending patterns for
equivalent quintiles computed by Opportunity Insights. See the Appendix for details.

For Central Bankers and others interested in inflation dynamics, my results highlight the
importance of monitoring sectoral inflation trends during the Pandemic. The combination of
negative demand and supply shocks suggests that aggregate inflation is likely to remain relatively
stable in the short-run compared to the 2008-2010 Financial Crisis. This is particularly true when
we take into account the changes in consumption patterns. Furthermore, my results could help
explain the sudden increase in consumer inflation expectations in April and May, as reported
in the Michigan Survey of Consumers.7 This behavior is consistent with a growing literate that

inflation.8

4

Impact in other Countries

In this section, I show results in 17 additional countries. The methodology remains the same
except for two differences. First, these countries use the COICOP classification system, which is
different from the one applied by the BLS in the US.9 Nevertheless, the matching and assumptions
are similar to those used for the US, as shown in the Appendix. Second, I do not have updated
expenditure estimates in other countries, so I assume that the change in spending for each
category during the Pandemic is the same as in the US. This provides an approximation to the
potential impact that the Covid consumption basket has in each of these countries. In the end,
the Covid shares are very different across countries because I start with the official CPI weights
and only update with the assumption that the relative changes in spending are similar to those
experienced in the US.
Table 3 compares the CPI and Covid annual inflation by May 2020. Detailed weights and
incidence by category are shown in the Appendix.

Table 3: CPI and Covid Inflation in May 2020
Notes: The top panel shows countries where the Covid inflation is higher than the fixed-basket CPI. The bottom panel
shows countries where the Covid inflation is lower than the fixed-basket CPI. Covid inflation rates are constructed
using official CPI weights in each country updated by the relative changes across categories observed in US data.
Details on the incidence of CPI categories on the monthly inflation rate in each country are shown in the Appendix.

In the top panel, I show those countries where the Covid Inflation rate is higher than that
of the fixed-basket official CPI, ranked by the percentage point difference. Consistent with the
US results, in most of these countries the higher Covid inflation rate is driven by an increase in
spending in “Food and Beverages”, which is experiencing more inflation, and a decrease in the
weight of “Transportation”, which is having significant deflation. Brazil is at the top because
the divergence in these two sectoral inflation rates has been more persistent since the Pandemic
started.
The bottom panel shows that some countries are experiencing less inflation with the Covid
basket. For these cases, there is no common explanation across countries. For example, in
the Appendix I show that in Germany there was less Covid inflation because there was less
weight on “Recreation and Culture,” a category that had a surprising inflation rate of 4.23%
10

during April, while in Ireland there was more weight on “Housing,” which was having significant
deflation that same month. Understanding the specific inflation dynamics within each of these
country is outside the scope of this paper, but these results highlight the fact that the basket bias
depends not only of the changes in the basket weights but also on the CPI sectoral inflation rates
experienced by each country. So far, the Pandemic has led to a divergence in sectoral inflation
rates that is causing higher Covid inflation in most countries, but the persistence of this result
ultimately depends on how supply and demand shocks affect different sectors across countries.
Overall, my results outside the US should be used as approximations to the Covid inflation
rates. Recognizing the potential bias stemming from the changes in consumption patterns, some
NSOs have recently started to produce experimental indices with ad-hoc adjustments to the
baskets, as in ONS (2020). Future research could help expand these efforts by computing Covid
expenditure weights using high-frequency transactional data in each country.

Conclusion

There is growing awareness among academics, central bankers, and the financial media about
the challenges of measuring and interpreting inflation measures during the Pandemic.10 A major
concern is that consumption patterns are greatly affected by the lockdowns and social-distancing
behaviors, introducing a potential bias into the measurement of CPI inflation.
Using estimates of the changes in consumption expenditures during the Pandemic, obtained
from US credit and debit card transactions by Chetty et al. (2020), I update the basket of CPI
weights and study the effect on on inflation in 18 countries. In most cases, I find that the
Covid price index has more inflation than the official CPI. In particular, in the US the annual
inflation rate by May 2020 was 0.95% with the Covid basket and only 0.13% with the official
CPI weights. The difference is growing over time as consumers continue to spend more on food
and similar categories experiencing inflation, and less on transportation and related categories
with significant deflation. The difference is also present in the Core CPI, implying that the bias
is not limited to consumer spending patterns on food and energy. Furthermore, I show that
low-income households are experiencing more inflation during the crisis, with an annual inflation
rate of 1.12% in May 2020, compared to just 0.57% for high-income households.

11

These results have important implications for policy-makers trying to respond to the crisis,
as they suggest that the cost of living for consumers is higher than implied by the official CPI.
The welfare implications are particularly relevant for lower-income households and extend to
many countries experiencing a divergence in sectoral inflation rates. While the persistence of
these effects is yet to be seen, the changes in consumer spending patterns during the first few
months of the Pandemic have already produced a significant difference in inflation dynamics.
