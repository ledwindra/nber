    "abstract": "\n\nWhen the Great Depression struck the United States, Oliver M.W. Sprague was America\u2019s foremost expert on financial crises. His History of Crises under the National Banking System is a frequently cited classic. Had he diagnosed a banking panic and called for an aggressive response by the Federal Reserve, it might have made a difference; but he did not. Sprague\u2019s misdiagnosis had, I argue, two causes. First, the crisis lacked the symptoms of a panic, such as high short-term interest rates in the New York money market, which Sprague had identified from his studies of previous crises. Second, Sprague\u2019s macro-economic ideas led him to conclude that an expansionary monetary policy would be of little help once a depression was underway. Sprague\u2019s main concern was that abandoning the gold standard would intensify the crisis, a concern that led him to resign his position as advisor to the U.S. Treasury to protest Roosevelt\u2019s gold policy.\n\n",
