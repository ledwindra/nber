Trigger Strategies and Price Dynamics in
Equity and Foreign Exchange Markets

ABSTRACT

Trigger

strategists may be defined as actors i r asset markets

who buy or sell when the price reaches a pr edeter ml ned level; they

include participants in portfolio insurance schemes in equity
markets and central banks who i nterverie to defend an exchange rate

target zone. This paper presents an approach to rnodel.l ing the
effects of trigger strategists, with emphasis on how target zones
affect

market expectations. It is shown that. commitment to defend

a target zone will generate stabilizing expectations within the
band,

which may generate a "target zone honeymoon". an extended

period in which the announcement of a target zone stabilizes

exchange rates without any riced for action on the

part

of

authorities. However, an imperfectly credible target zone is
vulnerable to crises in which the market tests the authorities'
resolve.

the trigger strategy is followed by private investors

computers to sell stock when the price drops below a specified

level. In foreign exchange markets the trigger strategy is
followed by central banks, who intervene when the exchange rate
reaches the limit of a target zone.
There are many questi ens that. riced to be answered r egar di ng
trigger strategies. When followed by private agents, are such
strategies rati orial? When followed by central banks, are they
welfare—improving? However, the first question we need to ask is a
descriptive one: how does the presence of trigger strategists
affect the dynamics of market behavior? Ever this is a highly
disputed question i ri practice. Many

the limits create targets for speculative attacks arid are

ultimately destabilizing.
This paper presents an approach to modelling the effects of
trigger strategies on price dynamics. The underlying method is to
determine an equilibrium relationship between the "fundamentals"

large group of trigger strategists alters this equilibrium in

simple geometrical interpretation in terms of the concavity or
convexity of the relationship between fundamentals and prices.

Similar issues have been discussed in earlier work on price

dynamics, notably that of Flood and Garber (1983), but the
particular approach taken here is new, and seems to yield simpler

The paper begins by laying out a simple model of pricing in

of a large group of portfolio insurers. It then turns to

A

model of equity prim.
We begin by laying out a simple model of' the determination of

prices in an equity market. This model is in the tradition of
financial market modelling associated with Tobin (1969): that

is,

it is a model of portfolio balance in which asset demands are
presumed

to arise

explicitly

from some maximizing behavior, but are riot

derived from utility maximization under uncertainty. In
2

particular, we will consider only the effects of changes over time

in expected returns in affecting asset. demands, ignoring the
possible effects of changes in higher moments of the return.

Consider, then, an asset which we take to represent the
aggregate of an equity market. This asset. yields a dividend per
period of
which fluctuates over time according to a process to
be described below. The asset has a price

The price after the por tfol i a insurers have left must be lower for

any given dividend rate, because the other investors have to be
given an incentive to hold a larger quantity of stock.

In this static expectations world, it is easy to see how

portfolio insurance schemes can cause a stock market crash.
Suppose that initially the insurers are present, so that the price
fluctuates

along E1E1. Then

at some point the random motion of r

will bring the market to the point C, precipitating the exit of
the insurers and pushing the market into the other regime: that

is, a

small (perhaps infinitesimal) negative shock to the

fundamentals produces the Collapse of the Dow CD.

This

may be a pretty good story f or what happened on October

19. However, in

general

we would not expect market dynamics to be

so simple, because the non—programmatic investors have an obvious

incentive to

foresee such events. Thus we next turn to the

portfolio insurers present to one in which they are gone.

To determine equilibrium values of A and B, we need one
further, though reasonable assumption. This is that dCi), the
deviation of the price from its static expectations level, is
bounded to some maximum values both positive and negative. (Any
non-infinite bound will do). This is effectively a "no speculative

assumption, of the kind now very familiar, and it is made

without apology.

Given this assumption, we may quickly determine the
equilibrium for the regime after the portfolio insurers have sold
out. Under this regime, i may take on any value, and will if we
give it long enough to walk randomly around. This means, however,

The

fundamentals-price relationship in this regime is tied
down by the fact that when the price falls below the trigger
level, there is a transition to the other regime. So the overall
picture must be as shown in Figure 2. The curve labelled
describes the behavior of prices while the portfolio insurers are
still in the market.

Eventually random

walking of r will bring the

market to C, leading the insurers to drop

out. After- that point,

The geometry of jjg strateq equilibrium

The equilibrium illustrated in Figure 2 has

that will be crucial in understanding the more

complex case of a target zone system treated in the remainder of
the paper. Notice that in the case where portfolio insurers have
not yet dropped out, the equity price lies below that which would
prevail with static expectations --

that

is, it must be the case

that the price is expected to fall. But how is this possible,
given that earnings follow a random walk? The answer lies in the

concaviti of the relationship between r and p. Because of the
curvature of the relationship, Jensen's inequality applies and the

expected change in p is negative. This observation can be turned

9

around: whenever p lies below its static—expectations locus, the

fundamentals—price relationship must be concave (and whenever p
lies above, it must be convex). This provides a rule for

quickly

the qualitative characteristics of price behavior in
trigger strategy equilibria, as we will see in the target zone

When the non—insurers have rational

there is no step drop in

p;

instead, the

pre--programmed sale of assets is willingly purchased. The reason
for

this is the change in the curvature of the fundamentals—price

relationship. Just before the sell-out, this relationship is
just after, it becomes linear. The expected change in p
therefore goes from negative to zero, implying a willingness of
investors other than participants in portfolio insurance schemes
to hold more equities -- with the equilibrium being constructed so
concave;

that. what they are willing to buy exactly matches what the
portfolio

insurers proceed to sell.

EXCHANGE RATE BEHAVIOR WITHIN A TARGET ZONE

We now turn to the more elaborate issue of how the presence
of an exchange rate target. zone —— a band within which the
exchange rate is supposed to remain, and which central banks are
expected to somehow defend if necessary —— affects

exchange rate

behavior. Clearly the fact that the exchange rate will not be

to go outside the band must have an effect on expectations
within the band; we would expect that as the exchange rate nears
allowed

10

the top of the band it will be perceived that it has more room to
go down than up, and conversely at the bottom of the band. This in
turn should produce stabilizing expectations that tend to keep the
exchange

rate within the band even when the band is not

actively

defended. The objective here is to take these vague

being

expectations and justify them with a clear model. As we will see,
the possibility of an imperfectly credible target zone, and the
corresponding risk of crisis, can also be accommodated within this
framework.

The basic model

As

in the equity market model, we consider a situation where

the exchange rate reflects both fundamentals and expected
appreciation and depreciation. In the target zone model ,

however,

it is also useful to make a distinction between the "shadow"
exchange rate, which is the exchange rate that would prevail at
each

moment if there were no action taken by the central banks,

arid the actual exchange rate. Inside the target zone the shadow

rate and the actual coincide, but when the shadow rate lies
outside the band the actual rate is constrained to lie at the
band's upper or lower limit.

Expressed in natural logarithms, the shadow rate is
determined as follows:

(14)

s=x

+

—

where x represents the "fundamentals"

11

that

ultimately drive the

exchange rate. A pure monetarist approach might identify x with
domestic credit, which is allowed to be reflected in money inside

the band but is offset by intervention when the limits are

reached; however, the model need not be construed in this
particular fashion, and x could represent the sum of a more
general set of influences.

and shadow exchange rate may be rewritten

Finally, the actual exchange rate depends on the shadow
exchange rate and on the

target zone. We assume that the exchange

rate is not allowed to go

above a maximum value of s or below a

value of s. The determination of the actual rate is

Exactly how this band is enforced will not, be specified.
Again in a purely monetary model we could envisage unsterilized
intervention that, offsets domestic credit creation when the
exchange rate hits the limits of the band, but the general
framework can be considered to apply to other policy measures as
wel 1.

It will be helpful if we choose units so that the target zone
is centered around a zero logarithm of the exchange rate:

We can then conveniently label the step" corresponding to a

zero x as zero, so that (again using the notation that. relates
variables t.o steps rather than time periods)

We

can immediately make a guess about what

the

relationship

between fundamentals and the exchange rate must look like; this is

in Figure 3. Within the band the exchange rate must lie
along an S-shaped curve, lying below the 45° line in the upper
half of the band, above the 45° line in the lower half. In the
right hand part of the S the curve is concave, providing through
shown

Jensen's inequality the expected decline in the exchange rate that
in turn keeps the curve below the 45° line. In the left hand part

of the S the curve is convex, providing the expected rise that
keeps the rate above the line. A curve of precisely this shape
will be generated by equation (24) if A is negative: the deviation
of the exchange rate from xCi) will then be negative and growing
for i>O, and reversed for i<O.
We know, then, the general shape of' the exchange rate curve
within the target zone. We can also see directly that the
expectation that the target zone will be defended does stabilize
exchange rates within the band. The slope of the S—curve is always
less

than 45°, so that changes in the fundamentals are reflected

less

than fully in the exchange rate; correspondingly, the

exchange

rate will remain within the band without intervention for

values of x that would have placed s outside the band in the
absence of a target zone.

To go further, it is necessary to tie down the S—curve.
Algebraically,
Geometrically

this means determining A in equation C24).

(and economically),

what we need to do

is determine

the level of x (or equivalently the step i) at which the S-curve

intersects the band. That is, at what level of the fundamentals do

the authorities have to make good on their promise to defend an
exchange rate target zone?

Lui

down the ends of the S

Let I be the step at which the S-curve intersects the upper
limit of the target zone. (It must correspondingly intersect the
lower limit

at

-I, but the symmetry of the problem allows us to

focus only on the upper end). The economic meaning of I is that

when the fundamental drifts up to x(I)

the

exchange rate would

overstep the bounds of the zone unless the authorities intervene.
This

implies that I is the lowest value of i such that

(26) sCI) > s
Consider the elements determining the shadow exchange rate at
the upper boundary of the target zone. The shadow exchange rate is

a weighted average of the fundamentals, the exchange rate at the
next lower step, and the exchange rate at the next higher step:
(27) sCI)

where d(I) = sCI)

Now step I-i lies inside the band, and therefore is
determined by (24). This implies that it can be related to d(I),
by the expression
(28)

dCI—1) =

A numerical example

Figure 5 shows a computation of the

relationship

between

fundamentals and exchange rates based upon some quasi—realistic
parameters. The assumptions are as follows:

Period length: 0.01 years
X:

0.9975 (implies that 1 percent annual rate of expected
depreciation reduces actual exchange rate by 4
percent).

6: 0.02 (implies annual standard deviation of

5:

exchange rate in

of target zone of 20 percent).

0, 10 (target zone 20 percent wide, 10 percent above and below
reference exchange rate)

In the absence of a target zone the exchange rate would
simply move up and down the 45° line in Figure 5. It would cross
the

boundaries of the indicated band at "steps" 5 and —5, that is,

its starting point. The

commitment

of f

expectations that greatly widen the range of fundamentals that
lead

to an outcome within the band. Specifically, the crossing

18

point I turns out to occur at step 17

that is, when the

fundamentals are 34 percent away from their starting point.

Because of its strong effect in stabilizing expectations, a
commitment to a target zone that is regarded as credible is likely
to succeed in stabilizing the exchange rate for an extended period
without

actually requiring any action from the authorities. One

measure of this stabilizing effect is the expected length of time
that the exchange rate will remain inside the band without
intervention. In this numerical example, there is a 50 percent
probability that in the absence of a target zone the exchange rate
would lie outside a 20 percent—wide band within 19 periods --

that

is, within 0. 19 years, or about 10 weeks. With a totally credible

commitment by the authorities to defend such a 20 percent zone,

there is a 50 percent probability that no action on the
authorities' part will be necessary for 219 periods, or mor-e than
two years!

This seems to suggest that announcing a commitment to defend
a target zone is a highly attractive action for politicians, since

large rewards in exchange rate stability will result immediately,

while the bill in terms of policy actions will not come due for
some time. We can think of this as the "target zone honeymoon"; it

is similar in a way to the initial capital inflows that result
when a country with a crawling peg slows the crawl in an effort to

reduce inflation (Connolly and Taylor 1984). A substantial
honeymoon effect may well have taken place in 1987, when markets

probably gave politicians more credit f or a willingness to act
than they deserved. However, in general we would expect the market

to discount promises to some extent, so that the next question is

19

what happens when the target zone is only partially credible.

Credibility and crises

Suppose that the market believes that there is only a
probability

that

the announced target zone will actually be

defended if challenged, and that with probability 1- the exchange

rate will actually be allowed t. move beyond the band. This will
clearly affect the dynamics of the exchange rate within the band:

stabilizing expectations will be weaker, and the expected length

of time before the authorities' resolve is challenged will be
shorter.
Let

be the step on which the target zone is tested in the

case of partial credibility. What happens at this step is that an

incipient movement of the exchange rate beyond the band either
does or does not bring forth the promised defense. If the defense
is

provided, the authorities are now credible, and the exchange

rate jumps to its full credibility level sCI). If the defense is
not provided, the market has discovered that it is living under a
free float, and the exchange rate jumps to its floating level
xCI). Thus the expected exchange rate at l, which must equal
the shadow rate at-

that point, is

= ØsCI)
The

+

Cl-)X(Ipc)

challenge to the target zone therefore takes place at the

lowest i f or which

> s. With the expected exchange rate

tied down at I and —I, the exchange rate behavior between
20

these bounds is described by a "squeezed" S—curve obeying equation
(24) and connecting these end points.
Figure 6 shows the exchange rate's behavior in our numerical
example when the market believes that there is only a O percent

chance that the authorities will actually defend the target zone.
The 10 percent band is now challenged after only 8 steps fr-om
zero, that is, after fundamentals have moved .16 percent away from
their starting point. There is still significant stabilization of

the exchange rate within the band, but the expected longevity of
the "target zone honeymoon" is greatly reduced: there is now a O
percent chance that the band will be challenged within 49 periods,
or about 6 months.

An interesting feature of the functioning of an

credible

imperfectly

target zone is that more or less continuous movement of

the fundamental determinants of the exchange rate gives rise to a

discontinuous movement of the exchange rate itself: when the

exchange rate drifts up to the edge of the zone, there is a
"crisis" in which the exchange rate jumps. The reason why such

crises are not ruled out by rational expectations is that the
exchange rate may jump either way —

with
i

into

the expected jump being zero.

CONCLtJSI ONS

This paper has offered a general method for analyzing markets
21

containing trigger strategists, arid two

applications,

of which the

analysis of target zones is the more extensive and probably the
most important.

The method is to look for an equilibrium relationship between

fundamental determinants of an asset price and its actual
price. Surprisingly, the curvature of this relationship plays a
crucial role, with concavity or convexity creating the
expectations of rising or falling asset prices that drive

the

deviations

from the static expectations case.

The application to exchange r-ate target zones reveals
three

important features of such zones that are widely understood

but not reflected in formal analysis. First, the presence of a
commitment by authorities to keep the exchange rate within a band
tends to stabilize the movement of the exchange rate even inside
that band. Second, announcement of a target zone will normally
provide a "target zone honeymoon": an extended period of time in
which stabilizing expectations keep the exchange rate within the
band without any need f or official action. Third, an imperfectly
credible target zone system will give rise to crises in which the
market challenges the commitment of the authorities to defend the
zone.

The

models offered in

simplified

this paper are of course highly

and abstract. However, the conclusions seem plausible.

and the method used here can be applied to more complex and
realistic models in the future.
