Slow Recoveries: A Structural Interpretation
Jordi Galí, Frank Smets, and Rafael Wouters
NBER Working Paper No. 18085
May 2012
JEL No. E32
ABSTRACT
An analysis of the performance of GDP, employment and other labor market variables following the
troughs in postwar U.S. business cycles points to much slower recoveries in the three most recent episodes,
but does not reveal any significant change over time in the relation between GDP and employment.
This leads us to characterize the last three episodes as slow recoveries, as opposed to jobless recoveries.
We use the estimated New Keynesian model in Galí-Smets-Wouters (2011) to provide a structural
interpretation for the slower recoveries since the early nineties.

Introduction

Even though more than two years have gone by since the latest cyclical
trough, the unemployment rate in the U.S. economy remains stubbornly high,
due to persistently weak job creation.1 As noted by many commentators, that
pattern is not new: a similar pattern can be observed in the aftermath of
the two previous recessions, in the early 1990s and early 2000s. The term
jobless recovery has been used by journalists, academics and policymakers
alike to refer to that phenomenon, which contrasts starkly with the strong
job creation and robust employment growth observed in previous cyclical
recoveries.2 In the present paper we revisit the evidence on U.S. cyclical
recoveries in order to understand better the causes and nature of any observed
changes, and the extent to which jobless recoveries may have become "the
new normal".
Our paper has two well di¤erentiated parts. In the …rst part, we provide
some basic quantitative evidence on the U.S. postwar recoveries. We start
by con…rming statistically the existence of a di¤erential pattern in the most
recent recoveries. But we emphasize one feature that has not been su¢ ciently recognized: the three cyclical recoveries since 1990 are characterized
by unusually low growth rates of both employment and GDP. In fact, we are
unable to uncover any evidence of structural change in the relation between
those two variables during recoveries. This leads us to relabel the phenomenon we are studying here as slow recoveries as opposed to jobless recoveries,

The NBER has determined that the trough of the Great Recession occurred in 2009Q2.

(November 2011).

the latter being a misnomer in light of our evidence.
In the second part of the paper we use an estimated version of the model
developed in Galí, Smets and Wouters (2011) to provide a structural interpretation (through the lens of that model) of the changing speed of recoveries.
In particular, we seek to evaluate the role of shocks and structural change as
a source of the slower recoveries experienced in recent times. When it comes
to shocks, the evidence suggests that relatively favorable (adverse) shocks
experienced during the pre-90 (post-90) recoveries themselves (rather than
shocks that originated during the preceding recessions) are the main factor
behind the di¤erential performance. Our main …ndings stress the change in
the sign of the contribution of risk premium and investment shocks as the
main reason for the signi…cantly slower recoveries during that recent period.
When we take a closer look at the recent episode we uncover a nonnegligible
role for adverse wage markup and monetary policy shocks as factors behind
the slow recovery. We interpret the latter …nding as re‡ecting the zero lower
bound on interest rates and the likely presence of downward wage rigidities.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides
the basic evidence on the post-recession performance of the U.S. economy.
Section 3 summarizes the main features of the Galí, Smets and Wouters
(2011) model. Section 4 discusses the role played by di¤erent shocks and
their timing, as well as the role of changing parameters, as determinants of
the speed of cyclical recoveries. Section 5 takes a closer look at the most
recent cyclical episode. Finally, we conclude in Section 6.

Postwar U.S. Recoveries: Basic Evidence

Figure 1a displays the cumulative growth of employment over the four quarters following the trough in each of the eleven postwar U.S. recessions, as
dated by the NBER. The …gure illustrates clearly the slower employment
growth characterizing the recoveries since the early 90s.3 As shown in Table
1, the cumulative growth rate of employment four quarters into the recovery
was on average 2.5 percent before the nineties, but -0.1 percent across the
three most recent recoveries. Dropping the recent recovery episode makes the
latter statistic slightly positive, but does not change the overall picture. A
similar pattern can be observed when we look instead at cumulative employment growth rates eight quarters into the recovery, as illustrated in Figure
1b. Note that in the latter …gure we have dropped the recovery following the
1980 recession, since the eight-quarter period following its trough overlaps
with the 81-82 recession, potentially distorting the evidence.4 In both cases,
we reject comfortably the hypothesis of equality of mean average growth
rates across subsample periods at a signi…cance level below one percent.5
3

We conducted a test for a break in the mean based on the maximum t-statistic (with
the latter corresponding to the test for equality of means across two populations) across
all possible sample splits. The outcome of the test con…rms the visual evidence of a break
starting in the early 90s. The latter is signi…cant at a level below 1 percent, on the basis of
Montecarlo simulations. The same …nding applies when we look instead at eight-quarter
growth rates (see below).
4
We dropped the recovery following the 1980 recession throughout the paper whenever
we look at eight-quarter periods.
5
We use a conventional test of equality of means across two populations (see, e.g.,
Lars and Marx (1981), p.322). Under the assumptions of normality, independence across
observations (i.e. recoveries, in our application), and equal variance across samples the
t-statistic follows a t-distribution with 9 degrees of freedom (8 in the case of the eightquarter growth rate due to having one observation less). The signi…cance levels reported
in the Table are based on that distribution.

3

Table 1 reports similar statistics for a number of additional variables.6
We start by discussing those directly related to the labor market, namely,
the labor force, the unemployment rate, hours per worker (workweek) and
aggregate hours.
As reported in Table 1, the cumulative growth rate of the labor force
during cyclical recoveries has also experienced a decline after 1990, but is
substantially smaller than that of employment growth (and signi…cant only
at the 10% level and for the 8 quarter horizon). Accordingly, the pattern of
employment during recoveries is largely mirrored by that of the unemployment rate. As shown in Table 1, and illustrated graphically in Figures 2a and
2b, the cumulative change in the unemployment rate has been positive on
average over the past three recoveries, which contrasts with large cumulative
decline in the unemployment rate during the pre-90 recoveries. The di¤erence between the two periods’ means is statistically signi…cant. So is the
di¤erence in the cumulative growth rate of aggregate hours, which shows a
pattern similar to that of employment, given the absence of a large/signi…cant
change in the recoveries pattern of hours per worker.
Next we turn to GDP, the central measure of overall economic activity.
Figures 3a and 3b show GDP growth rates accumulated over four and eight
quarters, respectively, following each postwar U.S. recession. Table 1 reports
the corresponding averages for the two subperiods considered. While the
mean is shifted upward relative to the corresponding …gures for employment,
6

The data were drawn from the FRED database at the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis, with the exception of aggregate hours which correspond to the "uno¢ cial" BLS
series used by Francis and Ramey and downloadable from Valerie Ramey’s web site. The
corresponding mnemonics for the remaining variables are: GDP (GDPC1), civilian employment (CE16OV), labor force (CLF16OV), and the unemployment rate (UNRATE).

4

we see that an identical pattern emerges, i.e. GDP growth rates have been
much lower during the recent recoveries, with a mean of 2.6 percent over four
quarters, compared to 7.6 percent in the earlier sample period (5.6 percent
vs. 12.5 percent if we look at an eight-quarter horizon). Again, and despite
the relatively small number of cyclical episodes, we can easily reject the null
of equality of mean recovery growth rates across subsamples also in the case
of GDP.
The previous evidence calls into question the widely held view of a "recovery in economic activity coexisting with a sluggish labor market" as a
distinctive feature of the aftermath of the three most recent recessions, and
which underlies the "jobless recoveries" label. Instead, it appears that the
recovery itself has been much slower than in earlier episodes.
In fact, there is no evidence of the labor market underperforming relative to the economy as a whole. This observation can be made precise by
looking at the evolution of labor productivity after each recession trough.
Figures 4a and 4b show the (4 and 8 quarter) cumulative growth rate of
GDP per worker after each cyclical trough. If the labor market had lagged
GDP in the more recent recovery episodes, the latter would be characterized
by a higher productivity growth. But this turns out not to be the case: As
shown in Table 1 the average cumulative growth rate of GDP per worker four
quarters into the recovery has been 2.7 percent across the three most recent
recessions, compared to 4.9 percent before the nineties. This is exactly the
opposite from what one would expect under the jobless recovery hypothesis.
A similar pattern arises when we look at the eight-quarter horizon statistics:
a 4.8 percent average cumulative productivity growth for the recent recov-

5

eries, 7 percent in the earlier ones. In both cases the di¤erence in means
across sample periods turns out not to be statistically signi…cant, but this
is beside the point given that the sign of the di¤erence is opposite from the
hypothesized one. A similar pattern can be observed if we take GDP per
hour as a measure of labor productivity, as seen in Table 1.
Another perspective on the same issue can be obtained by running an
"Okun’s law regression" of the change in the unemployment rate ( ut ) on
GDP growth ( yt ) and to test for a change in the associated coe¢ cient in the
post-1990 period. Using quarterly U.S. data for the pariod 1948Q1-2011Q4
the estimated equation (with standard errors in brackets) is
ut = 0:24

(0:022)

0:27

yt

(0:018)

0:04 dum90t

(0:037)

yt

where dum90t is a dummy variable for the post-1990 subsample period. As
made clear by the reported estimates there appears to be no trace of a change
in the Okun relationship across sample periods, which is consistent with the
evidence discussed above.
A possible explanation for the di¤erence in speed of recoveries across
periods is that before the 1990s recoveries were more robust because GDP had
fallen much more in the preceding recession and there was a more pronounced
"snap-back" e¤ect. But the similarity in the average cumulative GDP losses
during recessions in the two subperiods (1.85 and 1.92 percent, respectively)
do not help support that view.
To summarize: our characterization of changes over time in the pattern
of cyclical recoveries points to a substantial reduction in the growth rates
of GDP, employment and hours during the three most recent recoveries,
relative to the past. As a consequence unemployment has remained very
6

high as late as two years into the recovery, instead of experiencing the fast
decline observed in the aftermath of the earlier episodes. In the remainder
of the paper we try to shed some light on the reasons for that change, using
the model in Galí, Smets and Wouters (2011) as a reference framework.

The Slowing of Recoveries through the Lens
of an Estimated New Keynesian Model

In this section we use (updated) estimates of the model developed in Galí,
Smets and Wouters (2011; henceforth, GSW) to evaluate alternative hypotheses regarding the causes and nature of the recent slow recoveries. The GSW
model constitutes an evolution of the well known framework in Smets and
Wouters (2003, 2007). Smets and Wouters (2007) show that this framework
is able to compete with standard VAR and BVAR models in out-of-sample
forecasting. Theory embedded in the structural model is helpful in improving
the forecasts of the main US macro variables, including real GDP growth and
hours worked, in particular at business cycle frequencies. The SW framework
is therefore a good empirical model to examine the causes and nature of the
recent slow recoveries.
The main di¤erence with the GSW model lies in the explicit introduction
of unemployment, following the approach proposed in Galí (2011a, 2011b),
and the use of a utility speci…cation that parameterizes the strength of wealth
e¤ects (along the lines of Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009)). Next, we summarize
the key ingredients of that approach, emphasizing the reduced form relations
they give rise to.
The assumed preferences are such that the household’s marginal disutil7

ity from having an additional member employed (expressed in terms of consumption) is given in a symmetric equilibrium by M RSt =

'
t Zt Nt ,

where

Nt denotes the employment rate, Zt is a distributed lag of consumption (thus
restricting the short run impact of the latter’s changes on the marginal rate
of substitution), and

t

expf t g is an exogenous labor supply shock.

Thus, and using lower case letters to denote the logs of the original variable, we have:
mrst = zt + 'nt +

(1)

t

On the other hand, and as in Smets and Wouters (2007), the wage in‡ation equation implied by Calvo staggered wage setting is given by

latter is assumed to vary exogenously. Note that the average wage markup

pt is the average real wage (in logs).

The labor force or participation rate, denoted by lt (in logs), is pinned
down by the individual for whom the relevant marginal rate of substitution
is equal to the current average real wage. Thus, we can interpret
wt

pt = zt + 'lt +

t

(3)

as a labor supply equation. Note that the (arbitrarily) smooth response of
zt to any shock (given that it is a distributed lag of consumption), makes it
8

possible to reconcile the sluggish behavior of the average real wage with a
(mildly) procyclical labor force. See GSW (2011) for further discussion.7
Combining (1), (2), and (3), and letting ut

lt

nt denote the unem-

ployment rate, we can derive a simple relation between the latter and the
average wage markup (as in Galí (2011a)):
w;t

= 'ut

The latter relation allows us to rewrite the wage in‡ation equation in
terms of the unemployment rate:

(4)

As emphasized in GSW (2011) the error term in (4) captures exclusively
shocks to the desired wage markup, and not preference shocks (even though
the latter have been allowed for in our model). This is in contrast with the
representation of the wage equation found in Smets and Wouters (2007) and
related papers. That feature, made possible by reformulating the wage equation in terms of the (observable) unemployment rate, allows us to overcome
the key identi…cation problem raised by Chari et al. (2009) in their critique
of New Keynesian models. Thus, labor supply and wage markup shocks are
separately identi…ed in our framework, which allows us to determine their
role as a source of ‡uctuations in any historical episode.
The remaining aspects of the model and estimation are similar (though
not identical) to Smets and Wouters (2007).8 In particular, we use eight data

series as observables: GDP, consumption, investment, GDP de‡ator in‡ation,
the federal funds rate, the unemployment rate and two wage measures (compensation per employee, from the BLS Productivity and Costs Statistics,
and average weekly earnings, from the Current Employment Statistics. Furthermore, our model incorporates as many as eight driving forces, which we
group in three di¤erent categories on the grounds of their implied comovements among output, in‡ation and the real wage.9 More speci…cally, we
allow for four "demand" shocks (risk premium, monetary policy, exogenous
spending, and investment-speci…c technology), two "supply" shocks (neutral technology and price markups), and two "labor market" shocks (wage
markup and labor supply).
The model is estimated over the sample period 1966Q1-2007Q4 for the
reasons discussed in GSW (2011), and then simulated up to 2011Q2.

Accounting for Slow Recoveries

We use the estimated model in order to uncover the sources behind the
observed GDP patterns during cyclical recoveries. We …rst look at the role
of shocks, their nature and timing, while keeping parameters unchanged.
Then we re-estimate the model separately for two subsample periods and
carry out counterfactual simulations to assess the role of parameter changes
in accounting for the change in the speed of recoveries. The discussion below
focuses on the main …ndings of that analysis, which are reported in Tables 2
through 5. Additional tables with more detailed results can be found in the
online appendix.

See GSW (2011) for a discussion.

4.1

The Role of Shocks

We report a …rst set of estimates pertaining to the forces behind U.S cyclical
recoveries in Table 2. In particular the Table shows the average contribution
of the di¤erent structural shocks to the cumulative growth of GDP, four and
eight quarters after each recession trough. The model is estimated assuming
a linear trend in log per capita GDP, and the deviations from this trend are
used as a reference variable for the remainder of the exercise.10 As shown in
the …rst row of the Table, the growth rate of per capita GDP is well above
trend in the early period, while the corresponding average growth rate for the
post-90 period is just slightly above trend. The di¤erence between the two
periods is signi…cant at either the 10 percent (for the four-quarter horizon)
or 5 percent (for eight-quarter horizon) levels.
We quantify the role played by di¤erent shocks in accounting for the above
di¤erences. As discussed above we group the shocks into three categories
(demand, supply and labor market) and provide aggregated statistics for
each of them. A number of results stand out:
Supply shocks make a positive contribution to recoveries throughout
the sample period, but especially so in the post-90s. That contribution
is accounted for by technology shocks, with price markup shocks playing
a negligible role. The presence of labor hoarding, unaccounted for in
the current version of our model, could be partly responsible for the
strong role allocated to technology shocks.
10

The linear detrending and the normalization by the working age population explain the
di¤erences with the growth rates reported in Table 1. Tables with results for employment
and unemployment are qualitatively similar and can be found in the online Appendix.

11

Labor market shocks make a negative contribution in both subsample
periods, but more so in the more recent one. The overall di¤erence is,
however, not statistically signi…cant. Both wage markup shocks and
labor supply shocks are responsible for this, though the latter only so
in the post-90 period (largely accounting for the di¤erence between the
two periods).
Demand shocks make a large positive contribution to the recoveries of
the pre-90 period, but negative in the post-90 one. The di¤erence between the two is highly signi…cant, both economically and statistically.
This is in itself more than su¢ cient to explain the di¤erence in recovery
growth rates across subsample periods. Investment-speci…c technology
shocks play the largest role in accounting for that di¤erence.
Next we turn our attention to the timing of the shocks responsible for the
di¤erences in the speed of recoveries. Table 3 displays the results of a decomposition of GDP growth rates during recoveries based on the timing of the
shocks: before the onset of the recession ("initial state"), during the recession
("recession shocks") and during the recovery itself ("recovery shocks"). We
brie‡y summarize the main …ndings:
The bulk of the di¤erence in recovery growth rates across periods is the
result of a very di¤erent pattern of shocks during the recovery itself.
Those shocks were on average largely favorable in the pre-90 period,
accounting for much of the GDP growth above trend at both the fourquarter and eight-quarter horizons. On the other hand those shocks
have been somewhat adverse during the post-90 period.
12

The unwinding of the e¤ects of recession shocks also contributes to
GDP growth during cyclical recoveries, but can only account for a
small (and statistically insigni…cant) fraction of the di¤erence across
sample periods.
The observed di¤erence in the pattern of recovery shocks across periods
can be traced to demand shocks, whose contribution to recoveries were
positive in the pre-90 era, but strongly negative in the post-90 period.
This holds true for both four-quarter and eight-quarter horizons.
Supply shocks experienced during the recoveries have made highly positive contributions to GDP growth rate during those episodes, but cannot account for the slowing of recoveries in the recent period; on the
contrary, their positive contribution has risen over time.
On the other hand, labor supply shocks’during recoveries have made
on net a negative contribution to GDP growth during recoveries. This
is especially so at the eight-quarter frequency during the most recent
period, which may be related to the phenomenon of discouraged job
seekers.
We close this section by digging a little deeper and trying to uncover what
is the nature of the demand shocks that account for the latter’s di¤erential
impact during the recoveries. The answer to this question can be found in
Table 4, which reports the contribution to GDP growth during recoveries of
the di¤erent types of demand shocks experienced during those very episodes.
All four shocks appear to have made a non-trivial negative contribution during the post-90 era, both at the four-quarter and eight-quarter horizons. In
13

the case of spending and monetary shocks, this was also the case in the pre90 era. The bulk of di¤erence across periods is thus accounted for by risk
premium shocks and investment-speci…c technology shocks, which made a
positive contribution to the speed of recoveries in the pre-90 period, but a
negative one in the more recent period. That di¤erence is signi…cant for both
shocks and horizons (though not with the same level).

4.2

The Role of Parameters

The decompositions discussed in the previous section were based on the
model estimated over the period 1966Q1-2007Q4. Implicitly we assumed
that the economic parameters remained stable over that sample period. However, the slower recoveries since the 90s could also be related to changes in
the economic structure (i.e. parameter values) as opposed to changes in the
patterns of exogenous shocks. In order to evaluate this alternative hypothesis, we re-estimated the model over two sub-samples: 1966Q1-1984Q4 and
1984Q1-2007Q4. The parameter estimates for each of the subsamples (reported in the online appendix) con…rm the results in Smets and Wouters
(2007). First, we notice important changes in the parameters describing the
exogenous processes: the volatility of most of the shocks decreases during
the recent period. But we can also observe some important variation in the
structural parameters. Most of these changes are related to parameters that
are relatively weakly identi…ed and where endogenous rigidities or frictions
and persistence in the exogenous drivers are close substitutes. Some examples: the early sample period is characterized by relatively high habits in
preferences and a lower persistence in the risk premium, while the opposite

14

occurs during the more recent period. A similar switch happens between
endogenous price indexation (high in the early period) and persistence in
the price markup (higher in the later period); or between persistence in the
exogenous wage markup and wage stickiness. Of course, with our short subsamples and relatively uninformative priors, it is di¢ cult to conclude whether
these parameter changes really represent structural changes in the economy
or whether they just re‡ect weak identi…cation.
The previous caveat notwithstanding, if we take the hypothesis of a potential break seriously, the model allows us to carry out two exercises that
may shed light on the role of change in structural parameters as a source
of the slower recoveries during the recent period. In a …rst exercise, we use
the estimated structural parameters of the late subsample period and impose
them on the model estimated for the early subsample. With the resulting
model, we can simulate the outcomes of the pre-90s shocks with the post-90
parameters in place.11 If the estimated changes in the structural parameters play an important role in accounting for the change in the speed of
recoveries, we would expect that recoveries in the counterfactual simulation
would be signi…cantly slower than the actual ones in the pre-90s data. Table
5 summarizes the results from this exercise. The counterfactual simulation
indeed produces a slower recovery but this change is relatively small and
not signi…cant. For the four-quarter horizon, the average counterfactual recovery in output measured in deviation from the trend growth path is 2.43
percent against 2.60 percent in the data. This di¤erences increases for the
11
We only substitute the parameters describing the optimizing behavior of the agents
and the policy rule of the central bank. We keep the parameters of the exogenous processes
so that they remain consistent with the simulated innovations.

15

eight-quarter horizon with a cumulated output increase of 4.53 percent in
the counterfactual against 4.83 percent in the data. None of these di¤erences
are statistically signi…cant. When looking at the contribution of the di¤erent
shocks, it appears that the parameter changes have divergent implications for
the di¤erent shocks. Only in the case of labor market shocks and a 4-quarter
horizon we uncover a statistically signi…cant di¤erence between the actual
average growth rate and the counterfactual, but the sign is the wrong one.
We conclude that structural change, as re‡ected in variations in the model’s
parameters, is unlikely to have played a major role in explaining the slower
recoveries.
In the second exercise, we repeat the decomposition of Tables 2 and 3,
but now using the subsample estimated models to identify the shocks and to
evaluate their contribution to the slow recovery. If we take the hypothesis of a
break in the parameters as the correct hypothesis then the subsample models
should yield a more precise identi…cation of the shocks and their transmission
mechanism. The outcome of that exercise, summarized in Tables 6 and 7,
con…rms most of the previously discussed …ndings with one major exception:
The impact of recession shocks on the speed of recoveries now appears to
have changed over time. This is especially relevant for the 4-quarter cumulative growth statistic. Thus, while under the full-sample model, the impact
of the recessions shocks on output tended to be reversed relatively quickly
during the recovery, this stabilization process is much weaker in the model
estimated for the more recent period. This change is most apparent in the
case of demand shocks experienced during the recessions. When using the
full-sample model, but also in the pre-90 subsample model, the economy re-

16

covers quickly from the negative demand shocks that hit the economy during
the recession. This force is much less present in the model estimated for
the more recent sample period. The other side of the coin is that now the
adverse demand shocks experienced during the recovery become somewhat
less important for explaining the slower recoveries.

5

A Closer Look at the Great Recession and
its Aftermath

In this section we concentrate on the recovery after the Great Recession.
Figures 5a and 5b illustrate the role of the di¤erent exogenous forces driving
output and the unemployment rate, respectively, during the period 2007Q12011Q2, and based on the model estimated over the full sample. The following observations are worth making:
The Great Recession is mostly explained by negative risk premium and
investment shocks, whose adverse e¤ects clearly kick in when GDP
starts declining signi…cantly, in 2008Q3. Monetary policy shocks partially o¤set the negative demand developments during the early phase
of the recession, but its contribution turns negative from 2009Q2 onwards, possibly re‡ecting the zero lower bound constraint on the nominal short-term interest rate (which the model estimates interpret as an
"exogenous" deviation from the historical rule).
The very limited recovery of output after 2009Q2 coexists with persistently negative demand developments and is almost entirely driven by
positive productivity shocks. The contribution of the latter is larger
17

than during any of the previous recoveries in our sample.
The negative contribution of demand forces to the slowness of the recovery is accounted for by the four demand shocks, with investment
playing a somewhat larger role. In addition to the demand shocks, the
model attributes a substantial role to adverse wage markup shocks as
a factor behind the slow recovery. In other words, wages seem to have
adjusted less than economic conditions would warrant, given historical
estimates of the wage equation. We interpret that evidence as re‡ecting the likely presence of downward wage rigidities, in an environment
with low in‡ation and high unemployment.
A similar picture emerges when we look at the performance of the
unemployment rate. While the initial increase in unemployment during the Great Recession is largely due to contractionary risk premium
shocks, its persistently high level well into the recovery is mostly accounted by adverse exogenous wage markup shocks (about 3 percentage points) and by the combined negative in‡uence of the four demand
shocks. Note that, in contrast with the picture for output, productivity
developments have very limited e¤ects on unemployment.

Concluding Remarks

Our analysis of the performance of employment, GDP and other labor market
variables following the troughs of postwar U.S. business cycles points to much
slower recoveries in the three most recent episodes, but does not reveal any
signi…cant change over time in the relation between GDP and employment.
18

This leads us to characterize the last three episodes as slow recoveries, as
opposed to jobless recoveries.
We have sought to interpret that evidence through the lens of an estimated version of the New Keynesian model developed in Galí-Smets-Wouters
(2011). Our …ndings suggest that the slower recoveries are not due to structural change in the U.S. economy. Instead we uncover a dramatic change
in the sign of demand shocks experienced during the recovery itself and, according to some estimates, during the preceding recession as well. If our interpretation is correct, there is no fundamental reason why recoveries should
remain slow in the future, especially if there is room for expansionary …scal
and monetary policies that may counteract any adverse demand developments.
