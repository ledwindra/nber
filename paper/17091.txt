Poultry in Motion: A Study of International Trade Finance Practices

NBER Working Paper No. 17091
May 2011
JEL No. F1,G0,K12
ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes the financing terms that support international trade and sheds light on how and
why these arrangements affect trade. Using detailed transaction level data from a U.S. based exporter
of frozen and refrigerated food products, primarily poultry, it begins by describing broad patterns about
the use of alternative financing terms. These patterns help discipline a model in which the trade finance
mode is shaped by the risk that an importer defaults on an exporter and by the possibility that an exporter
does not deliver goods as specified in the contract. The empirical results indicate that transactions
are more likely to occur on cash in advance or letter of credit terms when the importer is located in
a country with weak contractual enforcement and in a country that is further from the exporter. Letters
of credit, however, are rarely used by the exporter. As an importer develops a relationship with the
exporter, transactions are less likely to occur on terms that require prepayment. During the recent crisis,
the exporter was more likely to demand cash in advance terms when transacting with new customers,
and customers that traded on cash in advance terms prior to the crisis disproportionately reduced their
purchases. These results can be rationalized by the model whenever (i) misbehavior on the part of
the exporter is of little concern to importers, and (ii) local banks in importing countries are typically
more effective than the exporter in pursuing financial claims against importers.

Introduction

Managers at …rms that engage in international trade must decide which …nancing terms to use in
their transactions. An exporter can require the importer to pay for goods before they are loaded for
shipment, can allow the importer to pay at some time after the goods have arrived at their destination, or can use some form of bank intermediation such as a letter of credit. Alternative terms are
associated with distinct risks and capital requirements for traders, and they give rise to cross-border
capital ‡ows and …nancial claims. Although similar claims arise for purely domestic transactions,
international transactions are unique because longer transportation times often increase working
capital requirements and variation in institutional context across countries introduces additional
considerations.1 How do cross-country di¤erences in contractual enforcement a¤ect the terms that
are selected and the prices that are charged in transactions that are …nanced in di¤erent ways?
Can the development of a relationship between traders mitigate concerns associated with weak
institutional environments? How did the manner in which trade is …nanced shape the impact of
shocks like the recent crisis on trade ‡ows? This paper sheds light on the relative use of di¤erent
kinds of …nancing terms and addresses these questions.
One of the main challenges in studying the …nancing arrangements used to support international
trade is that detailed data on how di¤erent types of transactions are …nanced are not readily
available. This paper begins by presenting some broad patterns that emerge from analyzing detailed
data on the activities of a single U.S.-based …rm that exports frozen and refrigerated food products,
primarily poultry. The data cover roughly $7 billion in sales to more than 140 countries over
the 1996-2009 period and contain comprehensive information on the …nancing terms used in each
transaction.
Three main facts emerge from this initial exploration. First, the most commonly used …nancing
terms do not involve direct …nancial intermediation by banks. They are cash in advance terms and
open account terms; these are used for 44.0% and 39.2% of the value of transactions, respectively.
Cash in advance terms require the importer to pay before goods are shipped and title is transferred. Open account terms allow a customer to pay a certain amount of time following receipt
of the goods. Over the sample period, 5.8% of the value of transactions occur on letter of credit
terms and 11.0% on documentary collection terms. Under both of these terms, banks intermediate
payments. In typical transactions …nanced with a letter of credit, a bank commits to pay for goods
on behalf of the importer, and this commitment is made before goods are shipped. Under the most
commonly used documentary collection terms, banks facilitate payments, but the exporter retains
the documents granting title to the goods until the importer pays to obtain them when goods arrive
at the importer’s location. Foley, Johnson, and Lane (2010) describe these terms in detail.
The second stylized fact that emerges from the data is that the location of the importer has
1

A substantial literature seeks to understand trade credit, or the …nancial relationships between …rms that have
supply relationships. Much of this work emphasizes the idea that …rms have access to better collateral or private
information as a consequence of interacting in product markets. Burkart and Ellingsen (2004), Cuñat (2007), Giannetti, Burkart, and Ellingsen (2011), Petersen and Rajan (1997), and Ng, Smith, and Smith (1999) represent recent
work in this …eld.

a large impact on the …nancing terms that are used. Sales to locations with weak contractual
enforcement are more likely to occur on cash in advance terms than sales to other locations. This
pattern holds for a variety of measures of contractual enforcement, and the di¤erences are large.
For example, 63.8% of exports to countries with a civil law legal origin occur on cash in advance
terms, but only 4.0% of exports to countries with a common law legal origin do. Survey evidence
suggests that these patterns are not unique to the …rm-speci…c data used in this paper.
The third main fact is that as the exporter establishes a relationship with an importer through
repeated interaction, transactions are less likely to occur on cash in advance terms. As the level of
cumulative transactions with a customer increases from values of less than $25,000 to more than $5
million, the share of transactions that occur on cash in advance terms falls from 60.3% to 10.9%.
These empirical patterns are used to motivate a model of how trade is …nanced. The mode
of …nancing chosen by …rms in the model is shaped by cross-country di¤erences in contractual
enforcement. In particular, there are two fundamental sources of contractual frictions: …rst, the
importer may default and not pay fully for goods it orders, and second, the exporter may not
produce and deliver goods as speci…ed. Trading partners choose to trade on cash in advance terms;
post shipment terms, which include documentary collection and open account terms; or letter of
credit terms. In post shipment term transactions, exporters expect lower revenues, relative to
those stated in the sales contract, when transacting with customers that are in environments where
contracts are enforced with a lower probability and in environments that are further away. Cash
in advance terms eliminate this default risk, but under these terms, importers might have concerns
about the quality of goods being shipped and are required to pay funding costs that might be high.
Finally, letters of credit reduce the problem of exporter misbehavior and also eliminate importer
default risk, but these instruments are associated with high bank fees.
The model identi…es a key condition under which exports to locations characterized by weak
contractual enforcement are more likely to occur on cash in advance or letter of credit terms as
opposed to other terms. Namely, this requires that local banks in the importing country are
better able than exporters to pursue …nancial claims against importers. This condition is plausible
given that such banks are likely to be familiar with and close to importers. Regardless of this
condition, the model predicts that the e¤ects of contractual enforcement on …nancing terms is
more pronounced for sales to customers located further away from the exporter. It also predicts
that, holding constant the volume of sales, prices should be set higher in post shipment term
transactions than in cash in advance transactions, especially for transactions with customers in
countries with weak contractual enforcement. The theory also indicates that the use of a letter of
credit is unlikely to be optimal whenever the exporter’s scope for misbehavior is limited, a plausible
scenario in the empirical setting considered.
In order to analyze the impact of the development of relationships between traders, a dynamic
extension of the theoretical framework considers the possibility that some fraction of importers is
trustworthy and honor a contract even when it is not enforced and the remaining fraction is not
always trustworthy. With a certain probability, these traders face a liquidity shock so they care

2

only about current payo¤s and do not honor a contract when it is not enforced. In this set up,
the exporter learns which importers are trustworthy and o¤ers post shipment …nancing terms as
a trading relationship develops. Introducing these features allows the model to shed light on the
impact of the recent economic crisis. This crisis can be mapped to the model as an increase in
the likelihood that importers face liquidity shocks and also as a decrease in demand. When these
events occur, new customers are more likely to trade with the exporter on cash in advance or letter
of credit terms, and importers that were trading with the exporter on such terms before the shock
are the ones that reduce their purchases the most.
Regression analysis explores the robustness of the basic empirical facts described above and
tests the other predictions generated by the model. Results of multinomial logit speci…cations
that explain the choice of …nancing terms indicate that cash in advance terms and letter of credit
terms are each more frequently used for sales to destinations where contracts are less likely to be
honored. Linear probability models that include measures of contractual enforcement interacted
with distance show that proximity reduces the e¤ects of weak contractual enforcement. Tests
…nd evidence supporting the additional theoretical prediction that transactions that occur on post
shipment terms have higher prices per pound than transactions that occur on other terms and that
the magnitude of these price di¤erences is larger when customers are located in weak institutional
environments. Analysis of the …nancing terms used when transacting with a particular customer
illustrates that as customers develop a relationship with the exporter, they trade on cash in advance
terms less frequently and on post shipment terms more frequently.
The data also inform the impact of the recent economic crisis. Customers that began to trade
with the exporter during the October 2008 to December 2009 period were more likely to trade
on cash in advance terms than customers that started to trade with the exporter during earlier
periods. Customers that traded on cash in advance terms prior to the crisis reduced their purchases
by larger amounts than those that had traded on post shipment terms.
Taken together, this analysis of the …nancing of trade reaches three main conclusions. First,
to engage in trade, …rms that are likely to have the most di¢ cult time obtaining capital appear
to be the ones that are most likely to need it. Firms located in countries with weak enforcement
of contracts typically …nance transactions, yet external capital is often very costly in such environments. This insight contributes to the literature that considers how institutional development
a¤ects cross-border …nancing decisions and trade. Previous work illustrates how institutions that
facilitate access to capital give rise to comparative advantage in sectors that require external …nance.2 Existing work also analyzes how …rms adjust their operating, …nancing, and investment
decisions in response to general problems of contract enforcement and to more speci…c problems
that make …nancial contracting costly.3 Very little work, with the exception of Ahn (2010), Olsen
2

Papers that develop this idea include Kletzer and Bardhan (1987), Beck (2002), Chaney (2005), Manova (2008,
2010), and Antràs and Caballero (2009).
3
Antràs (2003, 2005), Antràs and Helpman (2004, 2008), Levchenko (2007), and Nunn (2007) analyze the impact
of contractual enforcement on trade ‡ows and ownership structure. Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) and Antràs,
Desai, and Foley (2009) study the impact of costly …nancial contracting on …rm operating, …nancing, and investment
decisions.

3

(2010), and Schmidt-Eisenlohr (2011), has considered how institutional context shapes the …nancing
of trade.
The second conclusion is that as a trading relationship develops, it can be a source of capital
for …rms in countries with poorly functioning institutions. Put di¤erently, the establishment of
trading relationships overcomes concerns about the enforcement of contracts and allows capital to
‡ow to places where it is needed. In making this point, the paper contributes to research that
considers how relationships and experience can substitute for weak institutions.4 Papers in this
literature consider how relational mechanisms allow contracting without formal legal protections.
Analyses also consider the ways in which trust and the development of networks facilitate trade
and cross-border investment.5
Third, the results imply that the impact of shocks to demand and the liquidity of trading
partners is shaped by how trade is …nanced. The theory and the data indicate that sales to
customers that were trading with the exporter on cash in advance terms experience the largest
decline during downturns like the recent economic crisis. Di¤erences in performance are large.
Estimates imply that, between the …rst three quarters of 2008 and the subsequent three quarters,
customers that do not make use of post shipment terms decreased sales by 16.5 percentage points
more than customers that only used such terms. As such, the paper adds to a growing body of
work that analyzes how trade responds to macroeconomic and …nancial shocks.6
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data employed and
some general patterns that appear in the data. Sections 3 and 4 lay out a model of the …nancing
of international trade that is motivated by these patterns and that generates several additional
predictions. Section 5 presents tests of features of the theory, and Section 6 concludes.

2.1

Data and Three Empirical Facts
Basic Characteristics of the Data

To document general patterns in how international trade is …nanced and to test the implications
of the theory developed below, this study employs detailed data on the activities of a single U.S.
based exporter. This exporter is a marketer of frozen and refrigerated food products. It does not
produce the goods it sells, but it procures them from suppliers who are primarily based in the U.S.
and sells them to customers located in more than 140 countries. A small fraction of its products are
sold under one of its own brands, and the remainder are sold unbranded. The data are transactionlevel data and cover the 1996-2009 period. Each observation in the data set covers the shipment

(1999), Banerjee and Du‡o (2000), and Macchiavello (2010).

Schnabl, and Wolfenzon (2011) each analyze the decline in trade during the recent crisis. Alessandria, Kaboski, and
Midrigan (2010), Iacovone and Zavacka (2009), Stephens (1998), and Wang and Ronci (2006) examine earlier crises.
Several of these studies consider the role of credit conditions, but none make use of detailed transaction-level data.

of a product to a speci…c customer location. Shipments are primarily seaborne. Data on sales to
customers based in the U.S., which comprise 4% of aggregate sales, are removed to maintain the
focus on cross-border transactions.
Figure 1 presents information about the share of sales by destination region de…ned using the
World Bank’s grouping of countries into regions. There is wide variation in the destination of
exports. As indicated, slightly more than one-third of the products sold over the 1996-2009 period
were sold to customer locations in the East Asia and Paci…c region, and a similar share of sales
was sent to customer locations in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Approximately 20% of
sales was destined for Europe and Central Asia. About 3% was sold to the Middle East and North
Africa region, and the remainder to Sub-Saharan Africa, North America, and South Asia. Figure
2 provides information about the share of sales by broad product group. Slightly more than half
of aggregate 1996-2009 sales were sales of poultry, primarily chicken. Pork accounted for 22% of
sales and other meat for an additional 11%. Fruits and vegetables made up about 4% of sales, and
a variety of other products comprised the remainder.
The data include information on the date on which the sales transaction was booked and the
value and weight of goods sold. Perhaps most importantly for this study, the data indicate the
…nancing terms used for each transaction. Over the 1996-2009 period, the exporter used more
than 100 di¤erent …nancing terms when transacting with its customers. These can be grouped into
four types of terms: cash in advance terms, letter of credit terms, documentary collection terms,
and open account terms. Table 1 displays the categorization of the 20 most commonly used terms
that cover more than 90% of the sales in the data. Cash in advance terms typically involve a wire
transfer or deposit in advance of shipping goods. Open account terms require payment within a
7-30 day period after goods arrive at the importer’s location. Some less frequently used …nancing
terms include a mix of …nancing arrangements, and these are categorized according to the terms
that o¤er the most security to the exporter. For example, “50% wire transfer in advance / 50%
letter of credit” terms are classi…ed as cash in advance terms, but such terms are rarely used.

2.2

Three Facts about How Trade is Financed

Three broad empirical patterns emerge from a descriptive analysis of trends in the …nancing terms
used for di¤erent transactions. First, the fraction of the value of transactions that take place on
terms involving direct …nancial intermediation is small. Table 2 provides information about the
relative use of di¤erent …nancing terms for the full sample and various subsamples. The share
of sales on cash in advance terms is 44.0%, and the open account share is 39.2%. Documentary
collections and letters of credit account for 11.0% and 5.8% of sales, respectively. This table also
includes information about the relative use of …nancing terms for customers the …rst time they
appear in the data, excluding those that appear in 1996. 51.2% of these new customer sales occur
on cash in advance terms, 15.2% occur on letter of credit terms, 13.8% occur on sight draft terms,
and 19.8% occur on open account terms. Thus, terms tend to give the exporter more security when
transacting with new customers.
5

The second trend in the data is that sales to destinations with weak enforcement of contracts
are more likely to occur on terms that o¤er the exporter more security. Figure 3 displays the
share of sales that occur on di¤erent terms for sales made to locations classi…ed using four di¤erent
measures of the enforcement of contracts. Panel A characterizes countries by whether they are
common or civil law countries. Panels B, C, and D split countries according to whether their
measures of contract viability, payment delay, and the enforceability of contracts are above or
below sample medians. Countries with a common law legal tradition are identi…ed using data from
the CIA World Factbook, and this classi…cation is available for the broadest set of countries. La
Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1998) and Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and
Shleifer (2003) show that common law countries o¤er stronger protections to holders of …nancial
claims and more e¢ cient legal systems. Contract viability is a measure of the risk of contract
modi…cation or cancellation with higher values indicating lower risks, and it is drawn from the
International Country Risk Guide. Payment delay is also drawn from the International Country
Risk Guide, and it measures the risk of receiving and removing payments from a country with higher
values indicating lower risks. Enforcement of contracts comes from Knack and Keefer (1995), and
it captures the degree to which contractual agreements are honored with higher values indicating
higher enforcement. Within each panel, four bars with di¤erent degrees of shading are presented
for each subset of countries. The unshaded bars illustrate the share of sales that occur on cash in
advance terms, the lightly shaded bars illustrate the letter of credit share, the darker bars illustrate
the documentary collection share, and the darkest bars illustrate the open account share.
For each of the proxies of contractual enforcement, the cash in advance share is lower and the
open account share is higher where the strength of enforcement of contracts is higher. In common
law countries, 4.0% of sales occur on cash in advance terms and 78.2% of sales occur on open account
terms, while in civil law countries these shares are 63.8% and 20.4%. Similar di¤erences appear
when the sample is split using measures of contract viability, payment delay, and the enforceability
of contracts. Letters of credit and documentary collections are used much less frequently than cash
in advance and open account, and di¤erences in their use across institutional environments is small.
The third …nding that emerges from a descriptive look at the data relates to relationships
between traders. As a relationship with a customer develops, transactions are less likely to occur
on cash in advance terms. This pattern is illustrated in Figure 4. Each bar in this …gure indicates
the share of transactions that occur on cash in advance terms for a particular range of values of
cumulative sales to a customer that have taken place since the year the data coverage begins, 1996.
For the …rst $25,000 of sales, 60.0% of transactions are cash in advance transactions, and this share
falls monotonically, reaching 10.9% for sales that bring cumulative sales to values exceeding $5
million. Although this pattern suggests that the …nancing terms o¤ered to customers change as a
relationship matures, it could also re‡ect that trade on cash in advance terms may buy less. Tests
below use …xed e¤ects to illustrate that …nancing terms indeed appear to change for customers as
they establish their trustworthiness.

6

2.3

Representativeness of Sample

One question that arises about these facts is whether they are speci…c to the sample or whether they
hold more generally. Prior academic work does not identify the relative use of alternative …nancing
terms for trade and therefore o¤ers little guidance. Furthermore, many surveys, including recent
ones conducted by the International Chamber of Commerce, the International Monetary Fund, and
the Bankers’Association for Finance and Trade, are surveys of …nancial institutions and therefore
are based on limited information about transactions …nanced on cash in advance and open account
terms. Fortunately, a survey conducted by FCIB, a trade association of export credit and trade
…nance specialists, provides some insight. Its 2009 International Credit & Collection Survey asks
respondents to report “the top payment method”used in each of a set of countries. FCIB provides
the country-level distribution of replies for 44 countries. In this survey, cash in advance terms
and open account terms are also more commonly used than other terms. The average share of
respondents reporting cash in advance as the top payment method is 22.2% across countries, and
this …gure is 53.9% for open account, 13.2% for letters of credit, and 10.7% for documentary
collections.
Exporters that respond to the FCIB survey also use less secure terms when selling to markets
where contractual enforcement is stronger. This evidence appears in Panel A of Figure 5. The
bars re‡ect the average, computed across countries, of the share of FCIB survey respondents that
report open account terms as the top payment method. Within each pair of bars, the unshaded
one displays data for countries with relatively strong contractual enforcement and the shaded one
for countries with relatively weak contractual enforcement. The four pairs of bars represent sample
splits using di¤erent proxies for contractual enforcement. For each of the measures, open account
terms are more prevalent in countries where the likelihood that contracts are honored is higher.
Panel B presents results of performing similar calculations using the data analyzed elsewhere in
this paper. In order to meaningfully compare these data to the results of the FCIB survey, information on 2009 transactions is used to classify each country according to the top payment method.
Subsamples of countries are generated using the same criteria used to generate the subsamples that
appear in Panel A. The …gure reveals that the same pattern in the use of open account emerges;
open account terms are used more frequently where contractual enforcement is stronger.7
In sum, the FCIB survey results indicate that the …rst two facts described above generalize.
Unfortunately, the nature of the data from FCIB or from other sources does not allow one to verify
how …nancing terms change as relationships develop.
7
It is notable that the measure of the use of open account terms presented in Figure 5 di¤ers from that presented
in Figure 3. Figure 5 presents the share of countries in which open account terms are used more than other terms,
so this approach e¤ectively equally weights country-level measures. Figure 3 presents value-weighted measures of the
use of di¤erent terms. The di¤erences in these approaches matter because the exporter makes more extensive use of
cash in advance terms in larger markets with weak institutions and makes more extensive use of open account terms
in larger markets with strong contractual enforcement.

2.4

Additional Features of the Data

A few other features of the data are helpful in shedding light on the use of alternative …nancing
terms and disciplining the theory developed in Section 3. First, the exporter charges importers
higher prices when transactions occur on open account as opposed to other terms. The data from
the exporter include measures of the value and weight of goods sold, and the ratio of these is the
price charged per pound. Figure 6 illustrates the value-weighted average price per pound for all
products, calculated over the entire sample period. As indicated, the price per pound is $0.51
for transactions that occur on cash in advance terms, $0.47 for transactions that occur on letter
of credit terms, $0.53 for transactions that occur on documentary collection terms, and $0.67 for
transactions that occur on open account terms. This pattern in prices likely re‡ects the risk that the
importer might default in open account transactions and the fact that customers take more time to
make payments in transactions that occur on open account, and to a lesser extent, on documentary
collection terms. The theory developed below considers how prices should vary across di¤erent
kinds of customers, and Section 5.3 presents the results of tests of predictions of this theory that
control for the country and product composition of sales.
Aspects of the exporter’s business require a cautious approach when transacting on open account
terms. Industry margins are around 3-4%. Low margins reduce the attractiveness of o¤ering
customers open account terms on an experimental basis because the exporter could lose all of
the expected revenues in a transaction if an importer defaults when transacting on these terms.
Furthermore, there is signi…cant turnover among importers. In an average year, 39.5% of customers
that buy from the exporter do not do so in the following year, and 43.2% of customers did not
transact with the exporter in the previous year. These customers that enter and exit the data do,
however, make smaller purchases than those that remain in the data. Nevertheless, low margins
and signi…cant customer turnover imply substantial risks for open account transactions. In sum,
using open account terms to screen buyers does not appear to be a particularly bene…cial strategy
for the exporter, and as a consequence the model abstracts from this possibility.

3

A Basic Framework

This section develops a partial-equilibrium model of how the …nancing terms traders pick are shaped
by the institutional environments in which exporters and importers reside.

3.1

Model Setup

Environment The model considers the problem of an exporter that markets a measurable set
of varieties within an industry. These varieties are di¤erentiated in the eyes of consumers, so the
exporter faces a downward sloping demand for each of these varieties. Preferences are such that the
revenue obtained from the sale of a particular variety in country j = 1; :::; N can be expressed as a
strictly increasing and concave function of the quantity sold in that country, and as an increasing

8

function of a demand shifter

which may vary across varieties, i.e.,

Rj = R (xj ; ) ; with

@R (xj ; )
@ 2 R (xj ; )
> 0,
@xj
@ (xj )2

0,

@R (xj ; )
> 0,
@

(1)

with R (0; ) = R (xj ; 0) = 0. The measure of varieties produced by the …rm is assumed to be
exogenous, but it could easily be endogenized in a monopolistically competitive environment akin
to that in Melitz (2003).
On the supply side, the exporter faces a marginal cost normalized to 1 for all varieties regardless
of whether it produces and sells a given variety or it acts as an intermediary buying the goods from
suppliers and then exporting them. The exporter cannot access foreign consumers directly and
needs to contract with an importer in order to make varieties available to consumers in other
markets. Importers only handle one variety for the exporter. Shipping goods between any two
countries i and j is costly and entails iceberg costs equal to

ij

> 1. An additional …xed cost fij

associated with exporting is introduced later on.
Exporting Lags and Trade Finance In order to allow a role for how trade is …nanced, the
model incorporates a delay between the time that goods are produced and the time they are
consumed in foreign markets. This captures the fact that it takes a considerable amount of time
not only to transport goods but also to ful…ll all the customs, administrative, and port requirements
associated with shipping. To simplify matters, goods are assumed to be produced and shipped at
some initial time t = 0 and to reach foreign countries and be consumed at a later period t = 1.
If the exporter gets paid at t = 1, then the exporter acts as if it were lending the exported
goods to the importer before the latter can sell these goods to repay the loan. These kinds of
…nancing term are often referred to as open account terms. Such terms entail …nancing costs on
the part of the exporter, who must fund working capital requirements. In transactions that occur
on documentary collection terms, the exporter typically exchanges the goods for payment when the
goods reach the importer’s location so that such terms can also be mapped to payments occurring
at t = 1. In the empirical part of the paper, these two types of …nancing terms are combined to
create what is referred to as post shipment terms.
If the exporter is paid in advance at t = 0, then it is as if the importer is lending to the exporter.
Transactions that occur on these terms are called cash in advance transactions. They require the
importer to fund working capital needs associated with prepayment.

After considering cash in

advance and post shipment terms, letter of credit terms are introduced.
Contractual Frictions

Contractual frictions are captured by assuming that contracting is imper-

fect due to a problem of limited commitment, as in Hart and Moore (1994) or Thomas and Worrall
(1994). In particular, contracts signed at t = 0 are only enforced with probability
j

j

2 (0; 1), where

is an index of the quality of institutions in country j. When a contract is not enforced, parties

cannot commit to abide by the initial terms of the contract. For example, when the exporter sells

9

on post shipment terms, the importer is not compelled to honor contractual obligations concerning
payment at t = 1. Analogously, when an importer buys on cash in advance terms the exporter is
not compelled to honor contractual obligations concerning the amount or type of goods that are
traded. These contractual frictions also a¤ect the …nancial relationships of traders and their banks,
and this issue is discussed in Section 3.3 below.
When …nancing terms are post shipment terms and the contract is not enforced in the importing
country, the importer can threaten to refuse to pay. This leads to a renegotiation process that
reduces the cash ‡ows that the exporter expects to obtain at t = 1. For simplicity, let the exporter
receive a fraction

X

(

ij )

2 (0; 1) of the revenues that would have been generated if the initial

contract had been honored. It is assumed that this fraction is a decreasing function of the distance
as proxied by transport costs between the two markets. Anecdotally, it is more costly for an
exporter to enforce a claim against an importer who is located further away because exporters tend
to be less informed about the importer’s business practices, and it is more time consuming for
the exporter to make use of the dispute resolution mechanisms in the importer’s country. In some
industries, exporters’main recourse involves shipping goods back to the home market.8
In cash in advance transactions, there is no risk that the importer will not pay because payment
occurs before the shipment. However, in such transactions exporters might be tempted to shave
the quality or otherwise reduce the value of the goods being shipped. This is captured by assuming
that with probability 1

i,

with i being the exporting country, the initial contract is not enforced,

and the exporter is able to avoid an in…nitesimally small e¤ort cost without which the value of
the shipment is reduced by a factor

X.

In such a circumstance, the exporter ships the full value

initially agreed at t = 1 whenever it is privately optimal to do so, which is never the case in a cash
in advance transaction but always the case when trade occurs on post shipment terms.9
The initial contract signed by the exporter and the importer speci…es a volume of trade xj and
a payment Pt;ij from the importer to the exporter that occurs either at t = 0 or at t = 1. The
analysis of endogenous …nancing costs is signi…cantly simpli…ed when the exporter makes a takeit-or-leave-it o¤er to the importer, so this assumption is made throughout the analysis. Finally, it
is assumed that the importer has no wealth and is protected by limited liability, in the sense that
the amount paid by the importer can not exceed the market value of the purchased goods.

3.2

Trade Finance Choice with Exogenous Financing Costs

To build intuition, it is useful to begin by studying the choice between transactions on post shipment
terms and cash in advance terms while taking the costs of …nancing working capital requirements
as exogenous, although these are endogenized later. In a cash in advance transaction, the importer
8
Although contracts governing payments related to trade can specify a dispute resolution process and legal system
that should be used in case of a disagreement, enforcing awards ultimately requires the support of the law in the
country where the party that must make amends has assets. See Foley, Johnson, and Lane (2010) for additional
information about resolution dispute mechanisms.

This assumes that the exporter learns whether or not the contract is enforced in his country before he ships the

The choice is governed by the relative magnitude of the contractual frictions and exogenous …nancing costs associated with each …nancing mode. The likelihood that a transaction occurs on cash
in advance terms as opposed to post shipment terms is decreasing in the strength of contractual
enforcement in the importing country ( j ) and is increasing in the distance between the importing
and exporting countries (

ij ).

Both of these are associated with larger frictions stemming from lim11

ited commitment on the part of the importer. Furthermore, the negative e¤ect of weak contractual
enforcement in the importer’s country on the expected relative pro…tability of post shipment terms
is alleviated by the proximity of markets. The relative attractiveness of cash in advance terms is
also enhanced by a strong contractual environment in the exporting country (high

i ),

as well as

by high …nancing costs in the exporting country or low …nancing costs in the importing country.
The theoretical result regarding the e¤ect of the importer country’s institutional quality provides
a simple explanation for the second stylized fact described in Section 2. Buyers in countries with
weaker contracting are tempted to default with higher probability, and, for given …nancing costs,
this induces the exporter to make more extensive use of cash in advance terms. As intuitive as the
result might appear, it carries an important quali…cation when …nancing costs are endogenized.

3.3

Trade Finance Choice with Endogenous Financing Costs

As explained above, cash in advance terms require importers to fund working capital needs and
post shipment terms require the exporter to fund working capital needs. If funding costs are higher
in weak institutional environments, cash in advance terms may not be as desirable for transactions
involving importers in such environments. It is therefore informative to endogenize …nancing costs.
CIA in a transaction that occurs on cash in advance

terms, assume that the importer approaches a local bank to borrow the value of this payment.
Assume also that the banking sector is competitive, and the cost of funds is equal to 1 +

The

sector in the importing country. Banks are not, however, willing to lend at an interest rate equal
to

j

because of the same limited commitment constraints that induce exporters to favor cash in

advance over post shipment terms. The importer cannot credibly pledge all the revenue obtained
at t = 1 to a local bank, and this in turn implies that the exporter is not able to extract all
surplus from the importer even when making a take it or leave it o¤er. More formally, assume that
when the t = 0 …nancial contract between the bank and the importer is not enforced, the importer
defaults, or threatens to default, and the bank can only recoup a payment that equals a fraction
B

of the revenues generated at t = 1. The importer’s bank thus anticipates that the maximum

expected repayment that it can obtain from the importer is equal to a fraction

j

where institutions are particularly strong; and third, the emphasis in the paper is on the e¤ects of
variation in the importer’s …nancing costs on the choice of …nancing terms.

that is if only if local banks in the importing

Proposition 1 indicates that the patterns unveiled in Section 2.2 can be explained by the model
but only when local banks are more e¤ective in pursuing claims in the case of default, that is when
B

(

ij ).

This seems a natural assumption to make given that a local bank is likely to be

familiar with an importer’s business and is more able to use local dispute resolution mechanisms
because it is close by and familiar with them. Still, there may be situations in which exporters are
better able to pursue these claims than local banks. This could occur, for instance, in situations in
which the exporter ships highly specialized machines or inputs so that it is easier for that exporter
13

than for a local bank to redeploy those machines in case of default. Burkart and Ellingsen (2004)
develop this idea in their model of trade credit.
Thus, the modelling of endogenous …nancing costs leads to an important quali…cation of the
e¤ect of the institutional quality of the importer’s country on the mode of …nancing. However, the
remaining comparative statics discussed in the case of exogenous …nancing costs hold regardless,
implying:
Proposition 2 With endogenous …nancing costs, the likelihood that a transaction occurs on cash in
advance terms as opposed to post shipment terms is increasing in the distance between the importing
and exporting countries (

ij ).

Furthermore, the negative e¤ ect of weak importer institutions on the

expected relative pro…tability of transactions that occur on post shipment terms is alleviated by
proximity between markets.

3.4

Letters of Credit

Letters of credit can be incorporated into the model by assuming that they accomplish two objectives. First, a letter of credit ensures that the exporter only receives payment whenever its shipment
is in accordance with the initial contract. Hence, a letter of credit eliminates, or at least reduces,
the possibility that the exporter reduces the value of the shipped goods. Second, a letter of credit
substitutes the trustworthiness of the importer’s bank for that of the importer, and it is assumed
that the exporter necessarily gets paid if it meets its contractual obligations. However, in a letter
of credit transaction, the importer must make a payment to the importer’s bank. Following the
modelling choices above, the importer cannot commit not to renege on its promised payment, and if
it fails to meet its obligation, the bank can collect a share of the importer’s revenues,

B

>

X

(

ij ).

Furthermore, letters of credit are associated with a processing cost incurred by the importer’s bank,
and this cost is modelled as an increase in the cost of funding by a factor

j

> 1. As indicated

above, the banking sector in the importer’s country is assumed to be competitive and to break
even.
Following the same steps as above reveals that the pro…ts for the exporter in a letter of credit
transaction are given by:

From this the following conclusion follows:
Proposition 3 Letters of credit are unlikely to be optimal whenever the exporter’s scope for misbehavior is limited (in the sense that either

i

or

X

enforcement of the importing country, as captured by

are close to 1). The level of contractual
j

, is irrelevant for the choice between a

letter of credit and cash in advance terms. Conversely, the choice between a letter of credit and
post shipment terms is shaped by the institutional quality of the importing country and by distance
in a manner identical to the choice between cash in advance and post shipment terms.
The …rst statement in Proposition 3 helps rationalize the fact that letters of credit are not
prevalent in the data used in this paper. The model suggests that this is because the exporter is
located in the U.S. where contractual enforcement is strong and, perhaps more importantly, because
the type of goods that it sells are not prone to quality manipulation. Intuitively, in such cases,
the only bene…t of a letter of credit is to substitute the trustworthiness of the importer’s bank for
that of the importer, but the same can be achieved at lower cost with a cash in advance contract.
With regards to the second statement in Proposition 3, it should be emphasized that although
inequality (10) is independent of

j,

to the extent that the fees

j

charged on letters of credit are

a¤ected by the quality of institutions in the importing country, these institutional variables may
in fact signi…cantly a¤ect the choice between a letter of credit and cash in advance terms. Finally,
the last statement suggests that in empirical applications where the key variation is in importer
characteristics, there is little loss in grouping cash in advance and letters of credit into a single type
of …nancing terms, an approach that is used at times in the econometric analysis.10

3.5

Equilibrium Prices and the Trade Finance Mode

Section 2.4 above provides suggestive evidence that the prices charged by the exporter are higher
in post shipment term transactions. A comparison of prices is complicated by the fact that these
are determined by variety of product and importing country characteristics, some of which may
not be observed. Analysis presented below provides evidence of systematic price di¤erences that
appear even after controlling for product/country/Incoterm/year …xed e¤ects.11 In anticipation of
that analysis, it is informative to compare the price that the exporter would charge to the importer
10

The costs of letters of credit are modelled as increases in the marginal cost of fund provision. If these were
modelled as …xed costs, the analysis would be a bit more cumbersome, but it would deliver the prediction that,
ceteris paribus, letters of credit transactions should be larger than transactions involving other …nancing terms. This
is consistent with the data that appear in Appendix Table 1.

Incoterms terms refer to the international standard trade terms that govern which trading party is responsible
for which aspects of transport. The data contain information about which terms are used in each transaction.

under di¤erent …nancing modes while holding all the model parameters …xed.12 The data include
the price that the exporter quotes the importer in the initial contract at t = 0.
For the case of cash in advance terms, this price is straightforward to compute; the exporter
charges an ex-ante amount equal to P0CIA (pinned down by constraint (2)), so the implied price is

In the case of post shipment terms transactions, the price agreed at t = 0 is the one that the
exporter expects to obtain if the contract is enforced in the importing country. In that case, the
exporter demands a payment equal to the total sales receipts obtained at t = 1, implying a price of

(12)

A comparison of the two prices in (11) and (12) is not completely straightforward because sale
volumes and revenues need not be equal across …nancing modes even for common parameter values.
Notice, however, that holding constant the volume of sales xj , it is clear that prices are higher in
post shipment transactions than in cash in advance transactions. There are three reasons for this.
First, because of the potential for exporter misbehavior, the expected quality of the good is lower
in cash in advance transactions (i.e.,

X

< 1). Second, limited commitment problems reduce the

expected goods sold on cash in advance terms and increase the probability that actual payments
are only a fraction of promised payments in post shipment transactions. A third factor reducing
the price of cash in advance transactions relative to post shipment term transactions relates to the
j >
importer.13

higher cost of funds faced by the importer in cash in advance transactions (i.e.,
again limits the extent to which the exporter can extract surplus from the

0), which

Notice also that, again holding constant the value of sales, the di¤erence in prices pPj SP
pCIA
is predicted to be lower when contractual enforcement is stronger in the importer’s country.
j
Furthermore, larger transactions should be associated with lower prices. Section 5.3 presents tests
that explore the empirical validity of these predictions.
Finally, it is informative to consider prices in letter of credit transactions. These are determined
in a manner similar to prices in cash in advance transactions. Following analogous steps to those
12
This raises the question of why, in light of the model, one might observe both cash in advance and post shipment
terms transactions given the same parameter values. It would be straightforward to add a source of idiosyncratic
preferences for particular …nancing modes into our model so as to generate the observed heterogeneity in the data.
13
It may seem surprising that the cost of funds faced by the exporter is not a relevant factor in the comparison
of prices. This parameter would be central to a comparison of prices that left the exporter indi¤erent between
…nancing modes. Yet, because the exporter is assumed to make take-it-or-leave-it-o¤ers to importers, its indi¤erence
between terms is irrelevant in the computation of prices. In variants of the model with a more balanced distribution
of bargaining power, the wedge between the two prices would also be a¤ected by the cost of funds of the exporter.
Although a strong one, the assumption of full bargaining power on the part of the exporter allows the focus to be on
variation in price gaps stemming from importer characteristics, which maps to variation observed in the data that
are analyzed.

Relationship Dynamics and the Crisis

This section introduces a simple extension of the framework that sheds light on the e¤ect of relationships on the choice of …nancing terms. This extension is also useful in generating predictions
about the e¤ects of the recent economic crisis. For simplicity, this section rules out the possibility
of misbehavior on the part of the exporter by assuming

X

= 1, so that letters of credit are a

dominated …nancing mode. This seems reasonable for the empirical setting considered, given the
nature of the traded goods and the fact that letters of credit are rarely used in the data. The
analysis also assumes, as before, that the exporter is not credit constrained and thus ri =

i.

There

is substantial customer turnover in the data, and to generate this a …xed cost fij associated with
exporting from country i to country j is introduced. If the exporter incurs this cost, this modi…cation simply amounts to adding a term

fij in the pro…t functions derived above and has no

bearing on the results in Propositions 1 though 3.15

4.1

Dynamics

In the previous setup in which the exporter and the importer transact only once, it is optimal
for importers to deviate from their contractual obligations if contracts are not enforced. Suppose
instead that these agents interact on a repeated basis, and for simplicity, assume that the game
played between these agents is or is perceived to be in…nitely repeated. Assume also that importers
come in two types: they are either always patient and discount the future at a very low rate, or they
are stochastically myopic in which case, with certain probability , they care only about current
payo¤s and with the complementary probability 1

they are patient.16 Shocks to importers’

14
Although the model also characterizes the equilibrium volume of sales in the initial contract, it does not yield
sharp predictions for how sale volumes di¤er depending on …nancing modes. For example, comparing (7) and (4) with

with this ambiguity, unreported analysis indicates that there are not di¤erences between the yearly volumes of sales
for customers using these types of trade …nance terms.
15
Nevertheless, because R (xj ; ) ! 0 when ! 0, some exporters now optimally decide not to sell certain lowdemand varieties in foreign markets where …xed costs of exporting are substantial. Furthermore, the likelihood that
an exporter …nds it optimal to sell to a foreign market is decreasing in the distance between the two countries,
increasing in the demand shifter , and increasing in the institutional quality of the importing country j .
16
This formulation is related to the model of reputation building developed in Araujo and Ornelas (2007).

17

discount factors can be interpreted as liquidity shocks. When an importer is hit by a liquidity shock
it threatens to default when given the chance, which occurs with probability 1

j.

Conversely,

the exporter and the importer’s bank can use the threat of discontinuing the relationship to get
patient importers to meet their contractual obligations. Provided that the discount rate of patient
importers is su¢ ciently low, the folk theorem implies that an equilibrium exists in which patient
importers never threaten to default. It is assumed that this is the case, and thus patient agents are
always trustworthy.17
While defaults are publicly observed, whether an agent is always patient or stochastically myopic
is private information to that agent, and the exporter, as well as the importer’s bank, can only
form beliefs on the type of the particular importer they are dealing with.18 How are these beliefs
formed? First, it is common knowledge that, at any point in time, a fraction 1

of the population

of importers is stochastically myopic. Hence, a new importer is perceived to be always patient with
probability

. In repeated relationships, however, the probability assigned to the importer being

always patient evolves over time and increases with a history of no defaults. Denoting by b (T ) the

particular posterior probability assigned to the importer being always patient in a relationship of
length T and using Bayes’reveals that
b (T ) =

+ (1

) (1

+

)T

>

when there have been no defaults up to length T , and b (T ) = 0 otherwise. Whenever an importer
fails to meet its contractual obligations, the exporter and the importer’s bank optimally choose to

stop trading with the importer and begin to trade with a new importer, who is perceived to be
patient with probability . Note that, as long as there are no defaults, b (T ) is increasing in T and

thus as relationships evolve with no defaults, the exporter and the importer’s bank assign a higher
and higher probability to the importer being always patient.

How does this reputation-building process a¤ect the pro…tability of di¤erent trade …nancing
arrangements? Consider …rst the case of post shipment transactions. In a relationship of length T
with no prior defaults, pro…ts of this option are given by

where the term in square brackets captures the probability with which the exporter believes that
it will be paid the initially contracted price at t = T . This probability is increasing in the length
of an existing relationship, as the trust in the importer grows over time in the absence of defaults.
17

This requires that the importer obtains some positive payo¤ when he chooses to honor the contract. Still, for
a discount factor close enough to 1, this required payo¤ can be made arbitrarily close to 0. This limiting case is
considered for simplicity.
18
The analysis rules out the possibility of the exporter o¤ering a menu of contracts to screen the importer’s type.
One could envision that repeated interactions might also alleviate the scope for opportunism on the part of the
exporter and might increase the pro…tability of transactions that occur on cash in advance terms. This type of e¤ect,
however, is not likely to be relevant when X is close to 1, as the data suggest.

18

,

Consider next the case of cash in advance transactions, in which there exists the possibility of
the importer defaulting on its bank, though again this probability is perceived to decrease with
a history of no prior defaults. Given public information on past defaults, the exporter and the
importer’s bank terminate and reinitiate relationships in a similar manner. As a result, the length
of the exporter-importer relationship coincides with the length of the importer-bank relationship
and the pro…ts associated with a cash in advance transaction in a relationship of length T with no
prior defaults are given by:

Comparing equations (13) and (14), reveals that:
Proposition 4 Provided that

X

<

B,

the likelihood that a transaction with a particular

importer occurs on post shipment terms increases with the number of past interactions between
the exporter and that particular importer. Furthermore, in importing countries where contractual
enforcement is close to perfect, that is when

j

! 1, the e¤ ect of past interactions on the relative

pro…tability of transactions that occur on post shipment terms vanishes.

Intuitively, the reputation-building process that occurs through repeated interaction substitutes
for strong institutions, so the result bears a clear analogy to that in Proposition 1.19 A corollary of
Proposition 4 is that, other things equal, the likelihood that a transaction occurs on post shipment
terms is lower for transactions involving new customers relative to transactions involving repeat
customers. This prediction is consistent with the patterns documented in Table 2.
The solid curves presented in Figure 7 provide a graphical illustration of the e¤ect of past
interactions on the choice of …nancing mode. This graph is constructed for the interesting case in
which

19

It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the quality of institutions does not always diminish the e¤ect
of an increase in a relationship length on the relative pro…tability of post shipment versus cash in advance terms. The
reason for this is that the level of j a¤ects the speed of learning within relationships. For example, in contractual
weak (low ) environments, an increase in T starting from T = 0 quickly raises the relative pro…tability of post
shipment terms because there is signi…cant information in the importer not defaulting; but, in those environments,
little is learned once T is su¢ ciently high.
20
The analysis makes the strong assumption that the exporter and the importer’s bank update their beliefs on the
importer’s type in a symmetric fashion. The trade credit literature has argued that, in some cases, sellers might have
a comparative advantage (relative to …nancial intermediaries) in learning about the trustworthiness of their buyers.
A simple way to incorporate this feature into the model would be to assume that the importer’s bank has a worse
understanding of the industry than the exporter and in particular believes that the size of liquidity shocks is always
large enough to induce all agents (not just myopic ones) to default. In such a case, a bank would believe that the
importer defaults with a probability equal to the average default rate across importers in the country and would not
update this expected default rate based on the importer’s past history of defaults. As a result, the …nancial constraint
faced by the importer would not be relaxed over time and the pro…tability of cash-in-advance terms for the exporter
would not increase with the length of the relationship between the exporter and the importer (conditional on no

4.2

A Crisis

The dynamic extension of the model is also helpful for understanding patterns in customer turnover
and the e¤ects of the recent crisis. The recent crisis can be interpreted as a fall in demand, that
is a fall in

in the model, or as an increase in expected default stemming from an increase in the

probability of a liquidity shock
e¤ects of a fall in

faced by stochastically myopic importers.21 Figure 7 illustrates the

on the prevalence of the use of cash in advance terms and post shipment terms.

Equations (13) and (14) indicate that the fall in

reduces the pro…ts of transactions that occur on

both types of terms and increase the probability that an export relationship is terminated because
the …xed costs of exporting cannot be covered. In the …gure, the dashed lines indicate negative
pro…ts for values of T below T . This implies that importers that traded on cash in advance terms
before the demand shift are more likely to stop trading with the exporter than importers that
traded on post shipment terms. In other words, the extensive margin response to a fall in demand
should, other things equal, be larger for cash in advance transactions. The fall in

also reduces the

intensive margin or volume of export sales of surviving relationships. Without further restrictions
on the function R (xj ; ), it is unclear if decreases on the intensive margin are larger for importers
that were transacting on cash in advance terms or post shipment terms. In fact, for the often-used
case of isoelastic revenue functions, the e¤ect is proportionate for all …rms, as illustrated in Figure
7.
An increase in the probability that stochastically myopic importers face liquidity shocks generates richer e¤ects which are depicted in Figure 8. First, note from equations (13) and (14) that the
increase in

reduces the pro…tability of transactions that occur on both cash in advance and post

shipment terms.22 As in the case of a fall in , the fall in

implies that trade with importers that

were transacting on cash in advance terms before the shock is more likely to become unpro…table
than trade with importers than were transacting on post shipment terms. Di¤erentiation demonstrates a second e¤ect; for a given length of the relationship T , the pro…tability of transactions that
occur on post shipment terms is more severely a¤ected than that of transactions that occur on cash
in advance terms. Intuitively, the increase in

has a similar e¤ect as a decrease in the strength

of contractual enforcement in the importer’s country in the static model. As a consequence of this
result, the exporter becomes more likely to use cash in advance terms when transacting with new
customers during the crisis than before it. It is also important to note that an increase in

reduces

pro…ts by lower amounts for more established trading relationships, or relationships where T is
higher. The probability the exporter assigns to the importer being stochastically myopic is very
low in long-term relationships without prior defaults. An implication of this result is that importers
that transacted with the exporter on cash in advance terms prior to the crisis and continue to trade
defaults). Nevertheless, the fact that the exporter continues to update his belief on the importer type by observing
his history of defaults implies that the result in Proposition 4 would continue to hold in this modi…ed environment.
21
The approach here is very much reduced form. The fall in demand and increase in defaults would interact with
each other in a more detailed model.
22
In computing the e¤ect of the increase in on the pro…ts in equations (13) and (14), one should hold b (T ) …xed
because that belief is shaped by past default probabilities not by current or future ones. The new default probability
0
> a¤ects how future beliefs b (T 0 ) for T 0 > T are formed.

Econometric Evidence

The model has several testable implications. The data that are analyzed cover exports of a single
U.S. based …rm that serves importers in varied institutional environments. As the model does not
di¤erentiate between documentary collection and open account transactions, these are aggregated
into a category called post shipment terms. Most of the tests employ the invoice-level data and
include product variety …xed e¤ects to control for any di¤erences in how trade of di¤erent varieties
takes place.
Propositions 1-3 predict that cash in advance transactions and letter of credit terms are preferred
to post shipment terms when contractual enforcement is weak in the importer’s country and that
the institutional quality of the importer’s country does not a¤ect the choice between cash in advance
and letter of credit terms. The patterns displayed in Figure 3 which is described above are roughly
consistent with these ideas, but they are tested more rigorously using the speci…cations presented
in Table 4. Propositions 2 and 3 point out that cash in advance terms and letters of credit terms
are preferred to post shipment terms when there is more distance between the exporter and the
importer and that the impact of weak institutions is alleviated by proximity. Table 5 presents tests
of these predictions. Section 3.5 includes several predictions about prices of transactions that occur
on di¤erent terms and how price di¤erences vary with contractual enforcement in the importer’s
country. Table 6 presents results of tests of these ideas.
The model also has implications for how the development of trading relationships a¤ects the
terms used. Proposition 4 predicts that transactions are more likely to occur on post shipment
terms as a relationship develops and that the impact of relationships is largest when contractual
enforcement is weak. Figure 4 provides suggestive evidence of the impact of the development of
a trading relationship, and tests in Tables 7 and 8 analyze the e¤ects of past interactions more
carefully. Finally, Section 4.2 also formulates predictions about the e¤ects of the recent economic
crisis. Empirical facts related to these predictions appear in Tables 9 and 10. Before turning to the
tests, the text describes other data items that are used.

5.1

Other Data Items

Additional data items are based on the exporter’s data and a variety of other sources. The
transaction-level data from the exporter can be used to infer attributes of trading relationships
between the exporter and importers. It is possible to compute several measures of the extent to
which the exporter has established a base of trading experience with a customer. One such measure
is the sum of the value of past sales that the exporter has made to a particular customer. Another
is the count of the number of past transactions the exporter has engaged in with a particular customer. Each of these provides a proxy for the extent to which the exporter has been able to collect
information about a customer. However, these measures are subject to the concern that the sample
21

begins in 1996 so it is not possible to determine the extent of trade prior to this date. Tests below
therefore use 1996 data to compute proxies for trading relationships, but then drop observations
from 1996 to test for the e¤ects of relationships. The analysis below also considers if new customers
appearing in the data after 1996 receive distinctive …nancing terms.
Measures of institutional development are merged into the transaction data. In addition to the
four proxies for the strength of the enforcement of contracts described above, the analysis below
considers four other proxies for institutional quality. Con…dence in legal system is drawn from
a World Bank Survey of managers on the degree to which they believe the system will uphold
contracts and property rights in a business dispute, and higher values imply greater con…dence.
Duration of legal procedure is taken from Djankov, La Porta Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2003),
and it measures the total estimated duration in calendar days to pursue a claim on a bounced
check. Two outcome based measures of the development of institutions that protect …nancial
claimants are drawn from the World Bank’s Financial Structure database. Private Credit is the
ratio of private credit by deposit money banks and other …nancial institutions to GDP, and Stock
Market Capitalization is the value of listed shares to GDP. It is important to exercise caution
when interpreting measures of institutional development because they are highly correlated.
The analysis also makes use of two other country measures. Distance measures the number
of miles from the capital of each country to Washington, DC, and GDP per capita is measured
in nominal US dollars and comes from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Several of the areas
that the exporter serves are protectorates of other countries, and for these, the analysis assigns the
institutional features of the independent state that governs the nonindependent entity. For example,
American Samoa is assigned the legal institutions of the U.S. because it is a U.S. territory. Table
3 displays descriptive statistics for the tests described below.23

5.2

The Enforcement of Contracts, Distance, and Financing Terms

The extent to which contractual obligations are likely to be enforced features prominently in the
theory developed above. Table 4 presents results of some coe¢ cients generated by multinomial
speci…cations that analyze how proxies for the enforcement of contracts a¤ect the type of …nancing
terms that are chosen. These speci…cations consider three groupings of …nancing terms: cash in
advance terms, letter of credit terms, and post shipment terms. Measures of the strength of contract
23

The analysis primarily uses data at the transaction level that cover the sale of a speci…c product to a speci…c
country. Appendix Table 1 illustrates features of the detailed transaction data and how these data relate to orders
and annual measures of interactions with a customer. Sales per transaction are highest for transactions associated
with letter of credit terms, slightly lower for cash in advance terms, lower still for documentary collection terms,
and lowest for open account terms. A customer order can be, and often is, comprised of more than one transaction.
Orders occurring on open account terms cover an average of 4.3 transactions, which is more than twice as many
transactions as orders occurring on letter of credit or cash in advance terms. Despite this, mean sales per order has
the same ordinal ranking across types of terms as mean sales per transaction. This pattern is sensible given that
there are …xed costs associated with the creation and use of a letter of credit. Because customers that transact on
letter of credit and documentary collection terms place fewer orders per year than customers that transact on cash in
advance or open account terms, average annual sales are lower for customers using these terms than the others. Open
account terms feature the most orders per year, so that average annual sales are marginally higher for this …nancing
mode relative to cash in advance terms ($793,397 vs. $720,341).

22

enforcement are the dependent variables of interest, and eight di¤erent measures are considered,
one at a time. Each speci…cation includes a …xed e¤ect for each year and each of the product types
depicted in Figure 2 and controls for the log of the distance between Washington, DC and the
capital city of the destination country and the log of GDP per capital in the destination country to
ensure that measures of the strength of contract enforcement do not pick up the e¤ects of distance
or country wealth.24
The …rst column reports coe¢ cient estimates of the e¤ects of the strength of contractual enforcement on the relative choice of cash in advance and post shipment terms. The negative and
signi…cant coe¢ cient on the common law dummy in the …rst column implies that cash in advance
terms are less commonly used in countries with a common law legal origin than post shipment
terms. The second column reports coe¢ cient estimates for the choice between letter of credit terms
and post shipment terms. The negative and signi…cant coe¢ cient in this column implies that letters of credit are also less frequently used in common law countries than post shipment terms. The
third column contains coe¢ cient estimates for the choice between cash in advance terms and letter
of credit terms. Consistent with the predictions of the model, common law legal origin does not
have a signi…cant e¤ect on the relative use of these …nancing terms. The marginal e¤ects of selling
to a common law country implied by the results are large. The results predict that moving from
a common law country to a country with an alternative legal origin increases the probability that
cash in advance terms are used from 4.0% to 31.6%, increases the probability that letter of credit
terms are used from 0.5% to 4.2%, and decreases the probability that post shipment terms are used
from 95.6% to 64.2%.
Results are largely consistent for other measures of the strength of enforcement of contractual
obligations. If contracts are more viable, payment delays are less problematic, contracts are more
enforceable, or there is greater con…dence in the legal system, transactions are less likely to make
use of cash in advance relative to post shipment terms and less likely to make use of letter of credit
relative to post shipment terms. Similar choices are associated with outcome based measures of
the enforcement of contractual obligations, namely the depth of private credit markets and stock
markets, although the private credit variable is not signi…cant in explaining the choice between
letter of credit and post shipment terms. When the duration of legal procedures associated with
pursuing a claim on a bounced check is longer, cash in advance terms appear to be preferred to
post shipment terms and letter of credit terms appear to be preferred to post shipment terms,
but this measure is only signi…cant in explaining the second of these relative choices. Only one of
the measures of the strength of contractual enforcement has a signi…cant coe¢ cient in explaining
the choice between cash in advance terms and letter of credit terms. Private credit is negative
and signi…cant, suggesting that cash in advance terms are more frequently used than letter or
24

Dispute resolutions mechanisms allow the exporter to pursue claims against an importer wherever the importer
has assets. Therefore, sales to a particular location need not be governed by the institutions of that location if the
importer serves more than one market. As a consequence, although about 10% of customers import products to
more than one market, it is not possible to identify the role of institutional features o¤ of within customer variation.
The results in Table 4 are robust to dropping customers that serve more than one market.

23

credit terms when private credit markets are shallow, perhaps re‡ecting that fees on letters of
credit are disproportionately higher in those environments. These …ndings broadly support the
predictions about the e¤ects of the institutional quality of the importer’s country that are put
forth in propositions 1-3.25
These propositions also have implications for the e¤ects of distance and the interaction of
distance and measures of the strength of contractual enforcement. The speci…cations used to
generate the results presented in Table 4 include the log of distance, and the coe¢ cient on this
variable is positive and signi…cant in explaining the choice between cash in advance and post
shipment terms in 7 of 8 speci…cations, and it is positive and signi…cant in explaining the choice
between letter of credit and post shipment terms in 6 of 8 speci…cations. Thus, longer distances are
associated with greater use of cash in advance and letter of credit terms relative to post shipment
terms, consistent with the predictions.
One caveat about the results presented in Table 4 is noteworthy. These results emphasize the
impact of contractual enforcement in the importer’s country, which is denoted by the parameter
j

in the theory. This parameter measures enforcement of open account …nancing terms between

the exporter and importer as well as the enforcement of loans made by the importer’s bank to the
importer in cash in advance transactions. The model also accounts for the technological e¢ ciency
of the banking sector in the importer’s country, which is denoted by

j

and captures factors that

are not related to contractual enforcement and a¤ect funding costs. Unfortunately, there are no
clean empirical measures of

j.

As a consequence, the estimates in Table 4 might su¤er from

omitted variable bias. Given that weak contractual enforcement is likely to be associated with
weak technological e¢ ciency of banks and that these two conditions are predicted to have opposite
e¤ects on the use of cash in advance or letter of credit terms relative to post shipment terms, any
bias that does exist would likely yield underestimates of the magnitude of the e¤ects of contractual
enforcement.
Propositions 2 and 3 have implications for analysis of the interaction of distance and contractual
enforcement, but this analysis raises the issue that interaction terms can be di¢ cult to interpret
in multinomial logit models, as discussed in Ai and Norton (2003). Table 5 presents the results
of linear probability speci…cations in which the dependent variable is a dummy equal to one for
transactions that make use of cash in advance or letter of credit terms and zero otherwise. Given
that contractual enforcement and distance appear to have similar e¤ects on the use of both cash in
advance and letter of credit terms both theoretically and empirically, these are grouped together.
In order to simplify the exposition and the interpretation of the results, distance is measured
using a dummy equal to one for sales to destinations that are further away from the US than
25

One sample selection issue is worth noting. The data only include transactions that actually occur. According
to the theory, decreases in the institutional quality of the importer’s country reduce the pro…tability of all types of
transactions, so transactions in countries with weaker institutions are less likely to occur. If, as suggested by the
results, B > X ( ij ), unobserved transactions would be more likely to occur on cash-in-advance and letter of credit
terms. Therefore, the e¤ect of instituations on the use of these terms relative to post shipment terms would be likely
to be larger than indicated in the …rst two columns of Table 4 if one does not condition on transactions actually
occuring.

24

the mean transaction.26

These speci…cations include one of the eight measures of contractual

enforcement, the proxy for distance, the interaction of the distance proxy with the measure of
contractual enforcement, the log of GDP per capita, and year and product …xed e¤ects.
The results indicate that the coe¢ cients on measures of contractual enforcement on their own
are typically insigni…cant, and the coe¢ cients on the distance dummy are typically positive and
signi…cant. These results imply that for sales to destinations located close to the US, the extent of
contractual enforcement does not impact the …nancing terms employed and that cash in advance
and letter of credit terms are more commonly used for sales to more remote locations. In 6 of
the 8 speci…cations, the coe¢ cient on the interaction of the measures of contractual enforcement
and distance is signi…cant. For more remote sales, cash in advance and letter of credit terms are
less frequently used when the destination country has a common law legal origin, fewer problems
related to payment delays, more enforceable contracts, shorter duration of legal procedures, deeper
private credit markets, and larger stock markets. These …ndings are consistent with the prediction
of the theory that proximity mitigates the e¤ects of weak contractual enforcement.
One concern that can be raised about the simple speci…cations used to produce Tables 4 and 5
is that distance and measures of institutional quality could proxy for the amount of trade that takes
place between the exporter and importer. In general, one should exercise caution in interpreting
cross-country results, and in this particular setting longer distances and weaker institutions in the
importer’s country could be associated with lower amounts of trade, and these lower amounts might
trigger the use of cash in advance or letter of credit terms. Distance plays this role in Ahn (2010).
To check the robustness of the results to this concern, it is possible to include the log of the sales
value of the transaction, the log of the sales volume of the transaction, and the log of the sum
of past sales values from the exporter to the importer in the speci…cations used to generate the
results presented in Tables 4 and 5. Doing so does not materially change the results. Another
concern is that measures of institutional quality capture the e¤ects of exchange rate volatility.
Exporters might prefer cash in advance terms when transacting with customers in countries with
more volatile exchange rates. To address this possibility, end of month exchange rates are used to
compute the standard deviation in the …rst di¤erence of exchange rates over a one and …ve year
period. Each of these measures are negatively correlated with measures of institutional quality, as
suggested by Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Thaicharoen (2003). However, including either of
these variables in the speci…cations presented in Tables 4 and 5 does not have a material e¤ect on
the results. Finally, in Table 5, distance might capture market centrality. If goods are sold on post
shipment terms, it might be more costly to …nd another buyer for the goods in less central markets.
To consider this possibility, the log of the number of importers in each country/year and this value
interacted with the measures of contractual enforcement have been included in robustness tests of
the results in Table 5. The results are not materially a¤ected.
26

This approach generates estimates of the coe¢ cient on measures of contractual enforcement for two kinds of
locations, nearby ones and more remote ones. Using a continuous measure of distance generates results with similar
levels of statistical signi…cance, but further calculations are required to determine the association between …nancing
terms and contractual enforcement for nearby and remote locations.

25

5.3

Prices

The theory generates several predictions about prices once one controls for sale volumes. Specifically, the prices charged for goods sold on post shipment terms should be higher than the prices
charged on cash in advance terms. Furthermore, the di¤erences in these prices should be larger
in transactions in which the importer is located in a country with weak contractual enforcement,
re‡ecting the higher probability of default in open account transactions with such importers. In
addition, the prices of goods sold on letter of credit terms should be similar to those of goods sold
on cash in advance terms. Finally, all prices should be appear to be lower in larger transactions.
Table 6 of the paper presents the results of tests of these hypotheses. These tests do not intend
to pinpoint any kind of causality; they aim to describe average prices for sales that occur on di¤erent
terms, conditional on the value of sales, and to exhibit the correlation between prices and the size
of a transaction. The dependent variable is the price per pound, and each speci…cation includes a
…xed e¤ect for each product/country/Incoterm/year combination. Products that are classi…ed as
“Other” products in the data are dropped from the sample for this analysis because they include
a wide variety of items. The speci…cation presented in the …rst column includes a dummy for
transactions that occur on letter of credit terms and a dummy for transactions that occur on post
shipment terms so that the coe¢ cients on these dummies re‡ect average prices relative to the prices
charged for transactions on cash in advance terms. The coe¢ cient on the post shipment dummy is
positive and marginally signi…cant, indicating that prices changed in these transactions are $0.0326
higher than prices charged in cash in advance transactions. The second column adds a control for
the log of the value of sales. The coe¢ cient on this variable is negative and signi…cant, indicating
that larger transactions occur at lower prices. In this speci…cation, the coe¢ cient on the post
shipment dummy is larger in magnitude and has a higher degree of statistical signi…cance than
in the previous speci…cation, re‡ecting the fact that post shipment transactions typically have a
smaller value than cash in advance transactions.
The third and fourth columns display speci…cations that are similar to those in the …rst two
columns, but these also include the interaction of the letter of credit and post shipment dummies
with a proxy for the strength of contractual enforcement in the importer’s country, namely the
common law dummy. This proxy is used here because, relative to the others described earlier, it
is available for the largest set of countries in the sample. The positive and signi…cant coe¢ cient
on the post shipment dummy in the fourth column implies that prices charged in post shipment
term transactions are higher than those charged in cash in advance terms for importers in civil
law countries, and the negative and signi…cant coe¢ cient on the interaction of the post shipment
dummy and the common law dummy indicates that this price di¤erence is smaller for importers
in common law countries. In fact the magnitudes of these coe¢ cients are similar, which suggests
that the di¤erence in these prices is negligible in common law countries. This …nding is consistent
with the idea that prices of transactions that occur on open account terms re‡ect the higher risk of
importer default in weak institutional environments. The coe¢ cients on the letter of credit dummy
and interactions including it tend not to be statistically signi…cant throughout the table. Thus, the
26

results are consistent with the theoretical predictions.27

5.4

Creditworthiness, Relationships, and the Crisis

The theory considers the possibility that, within each country, some importers are always patient
and honor contracts when they are not enforced while others are stochastically myopic. Exporters
learn importers’ type by interacting with them. These features generate implications for how
…nancing terms change as a trading relationship develops; these are described in Proposition 4.
Speci…cally, importers that have traded more extensively with the exporter in the past should be
more likely to transact on post shipment terms and less likely to transact on cash in advance
terms. The strength of contractual enforcement should reduce the impact of the development of
an extensive trading relationship.
Table 7 displays the results of tests of these ideas. The speci…cations presented are linear
probability models that explain the use of di¤erent …nancing terms. Each speci…cation includes
…xed e¤ects for each customer in each country, so the impact of past interaction is identi…ed o¤
of changes in the …nancing terms o¤ered to particular customers in particular countries. The
speci…cations also include product …xed e¤ects and year …xed e¤ects, and standard errors are
clustered by customer.
To measure the extent to which the exporter and importers have interacted in the past, the
speci…cations in the odd numbered columns include the log of sales to a customer prior to a
particular transaction, and the speci…cations in the even numbered columns include the log of the
number of past transactions with a customer. These variables are interacted with a dummy equal to
one for common law countries to capture the possibility that an established trading relationship has
less of an impact in countries with strong institutions. The common law dummy is not included on
its own because it is subsumed by the …xed e¤ect for each customer in each country. Speci…cations
also include controls for the log of sales value, the log of sales volume, and the log of GDP per
capita.
The dependent variable in the …rst two columns is a dummy variable equal to one for transactions
that occur on cash in advance terms. The -0.0223 coe¢ cient on the log of previous sales in column
1 indicates that transactions with a customer are less likely to occur on cash in advance terms
as the value of past transactions with that customer increases. The magnitude of this coe¢ cient
implies that a one standard deviation increase in the log of previous sales is associated with a 3.7
percentage point decrease in the use of cash in advance terms. The 0.0218 coe¢ cient on the log of
previous sales interacted with the common law dummy o¤sets the coe¢ cient on the log of previous
sales on its own and indicates that the e¤ect of the development of a trading relationship is not
operative in common law countries but only in other countries. The second column presents results
using an alternative measure of the development of the relationship between the exporter and the
27

While it is tempting to use prices to calculate implied interest rates associated with di¤erent …nancing terms, the
data do not contain su¢ cient detail about the timing of payments to perform the required computations. Rough
estimates suggest that credit supplied by the exporter carries a high implied annualized interest rate, which is
consistent with estimates of the cost of trade credit in papers like Ng, Smith, and Smith (1999).

27

importer, and the results are similar.
Columns 3 and 4 repeat these speci…cations but the dependent variable is a dummy equal to
one for transactions that occur on letter of credit terms. Although the e¤ects of the development
of a relationship on letter of credit use is not explicitly considered in the model, it is considered
empirically nonetheless. Measures of the development of a trading relationship do not have a
signi…cant e¤ect on the use of this type of …nancing term in common law or other countries. One
possible explanation for this …nding is that the exporter and banks may not learn as much about
importers in letter of credit transactions as they do in cash in advance transactions because of
collateral requirements and limited interaction.
The dependent variable in columns 5 and 6 is a dummy equal to one for transactions that occur
on post shipment terms, and the results mirror those in columns 1 and 2. As customers develop a
relationship with the exporter, they are more likely to trade on post shipment terms, and the e¤ects
of past experience are not signi…cant for transactions with countries with stronger institutions.28
The tests presented in Table 8 provide further evidence of the impact of relationships by providing insight on the …nancing terms o¤ered to new customers, and it also informs the question of
how …nancing terms o¤ered to new customers changed during the recent economic crisis, a question
considered theoretically in Section 4.2. As in Table 7, the dependent variables are dummies equal
to one for transactions using cash in advance terms in columns 1 and 2, letter of credit terms in
columns 3 and 4, and post shipment terms in columns 5 and 6. The speci…cations include a new
customer dummy, a crisis dummy, the interaction of the new customer and crisis dummy, country
…xed e¤ects, product …xed e¤ects, and year …xed e¤ects.29
The new customer dummy is a dummy equal to one for observations related to the initial
transaction with a customer, and the coe¢ cient reveals if …nancing terms used for new customers
are distinctive when compared to those used for other customers within a particular country. The
positive and signi…cant coe¢ cient on this dummy in column 1 indicates that new customers are
more likely to transact on cash in advance terms than established customers. The coe¢ cient on the
crisis dummy, which is equal to one for transactions that are booked from October 2008-December
2009, is insigni…cant, but it is di¢ cult to interpret given the use of year …xed e¤ects. The positive
and signi…cant coe¢ cient on the new customer dummy interacted with the crisis dummy is perhaps
more telling. Consistent with the theoretical prediction, it indicates that the exporter is more likely
to transact with new customers on cash in advance terms during the crisis than it was before the
crisis. The test presented in column 2 of Table 8 controls for the log of sales value, the log of sales
volume, and the log of GDP per capita, and the results are similar to those presented in column 1.
28

Shocks experienced by individual importers could increase their purchases and their creditworhtiness, and the
results might merely re‡ect the impact of these kinds of shocks. To address this issue, it is possible to use a proxy for
the nature of the relationship between the exporter and the importer that is computing using the importer’s initial
level of purchases and the subsequent growth in the GDP of the importer’s country. Results using this technique are
similar to those presented in the paper.
29
While the tests presented in Table 7 include customer/country …xed e¤ects, product …xed e¤ects, and year …xed
e¤ects, those in Table 8 include country …xed e¤ects, product …xed e¤ects, and year …xed e¤ects. Identi…ng e¤ects
o¤ of within customer variation is undesireable because the sample period ends before the crisis subsides so it is not
possible to observe how the terms o¤ered to customer that were new during the crisis change after the crisis.

28

Tests presented in columns 3 and 4 of Table 8 analyze the extent to which transactions occur
on letter of credit terms. The results indicate that trade with new customers is more likely to
occur on letter of credit terms. This e¤ect does not appear to be more pronounced during the
crises. Columns 5 and 6 present the …ndings of analysis of the use of post shipment terms. These
mirror the results in columns 1 and 2. New customers are less likely to receive post shipment terms,
especially during the crisis.30
The economic events of late 2008 and 2009 had a large impact on trading generally; demand fell
signi…cantly, and importers and exporters questioned whether counterparties that had exhibited
creditworthy behavior in the past would continue to do so. In the theoretical framework developed
above, a demand and liquidity shock reduce the pro…tability of transactions that make use of all
types of …nancing terms. However, the decline in activity is predicted to be greatest for customers
that transact with the exporter on cash in advance terms prior to the crisis.
Table 9 presents descriptive statistics of growth rates around the time of the crisis that are
consistent with this prediction. As indicated in the …rst row of the table, the exporter’s sales fell
by 16.28% between the …rst three quarters of 2008 and the subsequent three quarters. The second
row displays the extent to which sales that occurred on di¤erent …nancing terms contributed to
this decline, and sales on cash in advance terms accounted for 10.26 percentage points of the
decline while sales on open account terms accounted for 3.46 percentage points of the decline.
Because 50.3% of sales in the …rst three quarters of 2008 occurred on cash in advance terms and
34.6% of sales occurred on open account terms, the decline in sales on cash in advance terms was
disproportionately large.
The subsequent rows in the table decompose the overall growth rates into growth in the intensive
margin, which accounts for 13.4 percentage points of the decline, and changes due to exit and
entry which account for -8.75 percentage points and 5.91 percentage points of the overall growth
respectively. Within each component, changes in sales that occur on cash in advance terms are
disproportionately large.
These patterns are analyzed in a regression framework in Table 10. The dependent variable
in columns 1 and 2 captures intensive margin growth and growth due to exit. It is equal to the
change in sales between the …rst three quarters of 2008 and the subsequent three quarters scaled by
the sum of sales in these two periods for customers that remain active, and it is set equal to -1 for
customers that only purchase goods in the pre-crisis period.31 The 0.1557 coe¢ cient on the share
of pre-crisis sales on post shipment terms variable indicates that customers that were purchasing
goods on these terms before the crisis reduce their sales less than other customers during the crisis.
The coe¢ cient remains positive and signi…cant in the speci…cation in column 2, which also controls
for the log of pre-crisis sales value and volume. The 0.1646 coe¢ cient implies that customers that
30

Selection considerations raise issues for the estimates in Table 8. During the crisis, new customers might be
di¤erent in terms of their risk pro…le than new customers at other times, thus biasing estimates. Conditioning on
the value and volume of the transaction helps address this issue. In addition, it seems reasonable to believe that,
if anything, new customers during the crisis are better credit risks than new customers before the crisis, and this
di¤erence would work against obtaining the …ndings in Table 8.

This approach is used in other work, including Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1989).

conducted none of their purchases on post shipment terms before the crisis decreased sales by 16.5
percentage points more than customers that conducted all of their sales on these terms.
The next four columns present results for intensive margin growth and growth that is a consequence of exit separately. In columns 3 and 4, the dependent variable is similar to the one used in
columns 1 and 2, but observations in which the customer purchases goods before the crisis but not
during the crisis are dropped from the sample. The results in column 3 indicate that customers
that transact on post shipment terms experience a smaller decline in sales on the intensive margin
than other customers, but the coe¢ cient on the share of pre-crisis sales on post shipment terms is
smaller and insigni…cant when the speci…cation includes the log of sales value and volume, as in
column 4. Columns 5 and 6 present results of linear probability models in which the dependent
variable is equal to one for customers that remain active during the crisis, and results of these tests
illustrate that customers that purchase a larger share of goods on post shipment terms are more
likely to remain active.
Taken together, the results in the paper generate two main insights about the e¤ect of the
recent crisis. First, the impact of the crisis on trade is shaped by how trade is …nanced. Importers
that were transacting with the exporter on cash in advance terms before the crisis decrease their
purchases by larger amounts. The theory and empirics generate strong results for changes on
the extensive margin, but they are more ambiguous concerning changes on the intensive margin.
Second, o¤setting factors cause the relative use of di¤erent …nancing terms to remain fairly stable.
The decline in sales to customers that were active before the crisis primarily re‡ects a decrease in
sales that occur on cash in advance terms, but the exporter transacted with new customers during
the crisis on primarily cash in advance terms. As a consequence, the share of sales occurring on
cash in advance terms decreases only slightly, from 50.3% to 47.9% between the …rst three quarters
of 2008 and the next three quarters.32

Conclusion

Existing research does not explain what kinds of …nancing terms are used to support trade in
di¤erent circumstances, and how and why these arrangements a¤ect trade. Few theoretical frameworks characterize how trade is …nanced, and a dearth of data limits empirical e¤orts. This paper
attempts to push research on this topic forward. It begins by presenting insights that emerge from
a descriptive analysis of detailed transaction-level data from a U.S. exporter. This analysis yields a
32
The results presented in Tables 4-10 have been subjected to several robustness tests. As mentioned in Section
2.1, some transactions involve a combination of terms, and terms have been classi…ed according to the category of
terms that o¤ers the exporter the most security. Classifying these according to the category of terms that o¤ers
the exporter the least amount of security yields results that are very similar to those that are in the tables. The
transaction-level data can be aggregated to the order level because some customer orders are associated with more
than one speci…c transaction. The speci…cations presented in Tables 4-8 make use of the transaction-level data in
order to include product …xed e¤ects and an order can cover transactions involving multiple products. Dropping
these …xed e¤ects and running tests using data aggregated to the order level yields …ndings that di¤er very little from
those presented in Table 4, 5, 7, and 8. Product …xed e¤ects are essential in Table 6, so this robustness test does
not apply.

30

few basic facts that motivate a model which in turn generates empirical predictions that are tested
more rigorously.
Three main conclusions emerge. First, …rms that are likely to have the highest costs of obtaining
external capital appear to be the ones that need it in order to …nance transactions. Descriptive
statistics and regression analyses that consider a variety of proxies for the strength of contractual
enforcement reveal that importers are more likely to transact on cash in advance terms in countries
where contracts are less likely to be honored. 63.8% of sales to importers in civil law countries occur
on cash in advance terms, but only 4.0% of sales to importers in common law countries occur on
these terms. This pattern can be rationalized in a model in which banks in the importing country
are more e¤ective than the exporter in pursuing claims against importers.
Second, …rms in weak institutional environments are able to overcome the constraints of such
environments if they can establish a relationship with their trading partners. Examination of
descriptive data and analysis of how …nancing terms o¤ered to speci…c customers change over
time show that as a relationship develops between trading partners, concerns about contractual
enforcement seem to subside, and transactions are more likely to occur on post shipment terms.
These …ndings are consistent with the predictions of a dynamic theoretical framework in which
importers are either patient and do not default when contracts are not enforced or are stochastically
myopic and face liquidity shocks with some probability that cause them to default when contracts
are not enforced. The exporter learns about the importer’s type by transacting with him and
becomes more willing to …nance transactions through open account terms as a relationship develops.
The third conclusion is that the manner in which trade is …nanced shapes the impact of macroeconomic and …nancial crises like the recent one. Using the theoretical framework developed in the
paper, crises can be modelled as a decrease in demand and an increase in the likelihood that liquidity shocks occur. Under these circumstances, importers that were transacting on cash in advance
terms before the crisis reduce their purchases the most, a pattern that appears in the data.
Additional research on how trade is …nanced could make novel contributions. Although survey evidence suggests that the relative use of alternative …nancing terms and that the impact of
contractual enforcement on the choice of …nancing terms are similar for other …rms, analysis of
how trade is …nanced in other settings could reveal new insights about how contracting problems
a¤ect international economic activity and the value of alternative types of collateral. For example,
product characteristics might shape …nancing terms and, in turn, levels of trade. Exporters of
commodities might be more willing to trade on letter of credit terms because these goods are a
more attractive form of collateral, but exporters of di¤erentiated goods might be more likely to
require the use of cash in advance terms. Studies of the …rm-level dynamics of trade rarely account
for considerations about how trade is …nanced, but …nancing e¤ects could be signi…cant and correlated with more commonly studied e¤ects. Transitions of …rms into and out of international trade
activity could re‡ect liquidity shocks and learning about which …rms are creditworthy rather than
learning about demand. The growth and productivity of traders could re‡ect the relaxation of a
…nancial constraint rather that some type of spillover. These topics are left for future research.

Descriptive Statistics
Notes: The Cash in Advance Dummy, Letter of Credit Dummy, and Post Shipment Dummy are dummies equal to one for transactions that
occur on cash in advance, letter of credit, or post delivery terms, respectively. Common Law Dummy is a dummy equal to one for
countries with a common law legal origin. Contract viability is drawn from the International Country Risk Guide, and it measures the risk
of contract modification or cancellation with higher values indicating lower risks. Payment Delay is also drawn from the International
Country Risk Guide, and it measures the risk of receiving and exporting payments from a country with higher values indicating lower
risks. Enforcement of Contracts comes from Knack and Keefer (1995), and it captures the degree to which contractual agreements are
honored with higher values indicating higher enforcement. Confidence in Legal System is drawn from a World Bank Survey of managers
on the degree to which they believe the system will uphold contracts and property rights in a business dispute, and higher values imply
greater confidence. Duration of Legal Procedure is taken from Djankov et al. (2003), and it measures the total estimated duration in
calendar days to pursue a claim on a bounced check. Private Credit is the ratio of private credit by deposit money banks and other
financial institutions to GDP, and Stock Market Capitalization is the value of listed shares to GDP. Distance measures the distance from
Washington DC to the capital city of a country. Price per Pound is the ratio of the value of sales to the weight of sales in a particular
transaction. Sales value is measured in dollars, and sales volume is measured in pounds. Log of Previous Sales is the log of aggregate
sales to a customer location prior to a transaction, and Log of Number of Previous Transactions is the log of the count of transactions to a
customer location prior to a transaction. Growth: All Customers is the growth in sales to customers measured as the change in sales
between the first three quarters of 2008, or the pre-crisis period, and the subsequent three quarters, or the crisis period, scaled by the sum
of sales in the pre-crisis and crisis periods. This growth rate is equal to -1 for customers that purchase goods in the pre-crisis period but
not the crisis period, but such customers are excluded from the sample in computing Growth: Customers that Remain Active. Customer
Remains Active is a dummy equal to one for customers that purchase goods in the pre-crisis and crisis periods and zero for customers that
only purchase goods in the pre-crisis period. Share of Pre-crisis Sales on Post Shipment Terms measures the share of purchases by a
customer during the pre-crisis period that occurred on post shipment terms. Log of Pre-crisis Sales Value is the log of pre-crisis sales
measured in millions of dollars, and Log of Pre-crisis Sales Volume is the log of pre-crisis sales measured in pounds.

Table 4
Financing Terms and Enforcement of Contacts
Notes: This table displays estimates of coefficients from multinomial logit specifications that explain the choice to use cash in advance, letter of
credit, or post shipment financing terms. The specifications include one of the country variables listed in the first column, the log of distance, the
log of GDP per capita, product fixed effects, and year fixed effects. Common Law Dummy is a dummy equal to one for countries with a common
law legal origin. Contract Viability is drawn from the International Country Risk Guide, and it measures the risk of contract modification or
cancellation with higher values indicating lower risks. Payment Delay is also drawn from the International Country Risk Guide, and it measures
the risk of receiving and exporting payments from a country with higher values indicating lower risks. Enforcement of Contracts comes from
Knack and Keefer (1995), and it captures the degree to which contractual agreements are honored with higher values indicating higher
enforcement. Confidence in Legal System is drawn from a World Bank Survey of managers on the degree to which they believe the system will
uphold contracts and property rights in a business dispute, and higher values imply greater confidence. Duration of Legal Procedure is taken from
Djankov et al. (2003), and it measures the total estimated duration in calendar days to pursue a claim on a bounced check. Private Credit is the
ratio of private credit by deposit money banks and other financial institutions to GDP, and Stock Market Capitalization is the value of listed shares
to GDP. Distance measures the distance from Washington DC to the capital city of a country. Standard errors that correct for clustering by country
appear in parentheses below coefficients. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Table 9
Growth and its Components During the Crisis
Notes: This table displays aggregate measures of sales growth and components of sales growth during the recent financial crisis. Growth is
measured as the change in sales between the first three quarters of 2008, or the pre-crisis period, and the subsequent three quarters, or the crisis
period, scaled by the level of sales in the pre-crisis period. The first column displays growth for sales occurring on all terms, and the next four
columns display the extent to which sales on different financing terms contribute to the total. Overall growth is also decomposed into intensive
margin growth, or the growth due to changes in sales to customers that are active in the pre-crisis and crisis periods, as well as growth due to exit
and entry. Growth due to exit is measured by scaling the sales of customers that were active in the pre-crisis period but not the crisis period by the
level of sales in the pre-crisis period. Growth due to entry is measured by scaling the sales of customers that were active in the crisis period but
not the pre-crisis period by the level of sales in the pre-crisis period.

Effects of Crisis on Growth by Financing Terms
Notes: The dependent variable in the specifications that appear in columns 1 and 2 is the growth in sales to customers measured as the change in sales between the first three quarters of 2008,
or the pre-crisis period, and the subsequent three quarters, or the crisis period, scaled by the sum of sales in the pre-crisis and crisis periods. In these columns, the growth rate is equal to -1 for
customers that purchase goods in the pre-crisis period but not the crisis period, but such customers are excluded from the sample in columns 3 and 4 which analyze growth on the intensive
margin. The dependent variable in the specifications that appear in columns 5 and 6 is a dummy equal to one for customers that purchase goods in the pre-crisis and crisis periods and zero for
customers that only purchase goods in the pre-crisis period. Share of Pre-crisis Sales on Post Shipment Terms measures the share of purchases by a customer during the pre-crisis period that
occurred on post shipment terms. Log of Pre-crisis Sales Value is the log of pre-crisis sales measured in millions of dollars, and Log of Pre-crisis Sales Volume is the log of pre-crisis sales
measured in pounds. The specifications are OLS specifications, and heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors appear in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1, 5, and 10
percent levels, respectively.

Appendix Table 1
Transaction and Order Characteristics by Financing Terms
Notes: This table characterizes the level and frequency of interactions between the exporter and importers for each type of financing term. It
provides means of the sales per transaction, the number of transactions per order, sales per order, and orders per year. Each transaction corresponds
to the shipment of a particular product to a specific customer location. A customer order can be associated with more than one transaction. The
number of orders per year measures the number of orders placed by a specific customer that are shipped to a specific country on one of the four
specific types of financing terms. Mean sales per year is a similar measure for sales.
