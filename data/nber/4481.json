    "abstract": "\n\nWe test the hypothesis that the Great Contraction would have been attenuated had the Fed not allowed the money stock to decline.  We do so by simulating a model that estimates separate relations for output and the price level and assumes that output and price dynamics are not especially sensitive to policy changes.  The simulations include a strong and a weak form of Friedman's constant money growth rule.  The results support the hypothesis that the Great Contraction would have been mitigated and shortened had the Fed followed a constant money growth rule.\n\n",
