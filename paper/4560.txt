EVALUATION OF SUBJECTIVE
PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS
IN THE HRS

ABSTRACT

In the Health and Retirement Survey respondents were asked about the chances they
would live to 75 or to 85, and the chances they would work after age 62 or 65. We analyze the

responses to detennine if they behave like probabilities, if their averages are close to average
probabilities in the population, and if they have correlations with other variables that are similar

to correlations with actual outcomes. We find that generally they do behave like probabilities

and they do aggregate. Most remarkable, however, is that they covary with other variables in

the same way actual outcomes vary with the variables. For example, smokers give lower
probabilities of living to 75 than nonsmokers. We conclude that these measures of subjective

probabilities have great potential use in models of intertemporal decision making under
uncertainty.

1. Introduction

Many economic models are based on forward looking behavior by economic

agents. Although it is often said that expectationf about future events
these

models, more precisely

it is the probability

distributions

are important in

of future events that

enter

the models. For example, consumption and savings decisions of an individual are

thought to depend on beliefs about future interest rates, the likelihood of dying, and the
risk of substantial future medical expenditures. According to this theory, decision
makers have subjective probability distributions about these and other events and they
use them to make decisions about saving.

In a few microeconomic models, we have data on probability distributions that
may plausibly be assumed to approximate those required by the models of decision

making under uncertainty. For example, life cycle models of consumption in which
mortality risk helps determine saving have been estimated by assuming that individuals

have subjective probability distributions on mortality risk that are the same as those

found from life tables. In most applications, however, we do not have data on
probability distributions, so estimation requires some unverifiable assumptions. For
example, in macroeconomic models expectations are assumed to be rational, which often

yields an estimable relationship; yet, the rationality assumption cannot be tested outside
of the context of the model. In life cycle models of saving, the average mortality risk of
a cohort may not be well approximated by the life table mortality risk because of

changing risk: a cohort may not believe that the mortality experience of older cohorts is
the same as its will be. Furthermore, individuals within a cohort will have different
subjective probability distributions on mortality risk because of observable and
unobservable differences in mortality risk factors. Finally, an individual's own subjective
evaluation of probability distributions determines behavior, even if it is systematically

incorrect; yet that evaluation is not generally observable.

The Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) has a number of innovative questions
in which respondents were asked on a 0-10 scale the chances of future events such as

working full-time past age 62 or living to age 75.' After rescaling to 0-1, these

can

be

interpreted as subjective probability distributions on the events, They have the potential
to change substantially the way in which we estimate stochastic dynamic models based on
micro data because they can supply probabilities of events for which we have no
population avenges, and because they contain individual heterogeneity about

probabilities. They can, in principle, be used directly in our models of decision making.
This makes them different from subjective evaluations

that have been elicited in previous

surveys: questions such as "When do you expect to retire?* have been asked before, but
the

responses cannot be used in a quantifiable way in our models.

While the HRS questions about subjective probabilities have great potential, it is

certainly possible that, as an empirical matter, they are not particularly useful. For
example, respondents may have little idea of the probabilities of future events, or they
may answer at random. Of course the best evaluation of them will come from a
comparison of the probabilities with outcomes in the panel. But even in cross-section we
can learn a great deal.
The broad goal of this paper is to evaluate the subjective probability distributions
in three ways. First, we will check external consistency: how do the probabilities

compare with probabilities found in external data? We compare avenges of the
subjective probability distributions with population averages such as probabilities of living
from life tables and retirement probabilities. Second, we study the intemaj consistency

of the subjective probability distributions to see if they behave like probabilities. For
example, do they imply conditional probabilities that are between zero and one.
Our third kind of evaluation takes the subjective probabilities to be actual
outcomes. We explain those outcomes with simple equations estimated over individual
level data and compare the estimates with results from the literature.

2. Measures of subjective probability distributions in the I-IRS.

HRS has a number of questions that can be interpreted as subjective

The

probability distributions. All the questions are asked in the following

form:

"Using any number from zero to ten where 0 equals absolutely no chance
and 10 equals absolutely certain, what do you think are the chances you
will live to be 75 or more'?"

"You will be working full-time after you reach age 62? Age 65?"
and other questions on housing purchase, job stability, financial help to family, housing
prices, Social Security, and the economy.

In this paper we study the responses to the questions about living to 75 or 85,
which we will call Plive75 and Plive85, and the responses the questions about working
full-time, which we will call Pwork62 and Pwork65. After normalizing to [0,1] we will

call these the probabilities of living or of working, but they are, at best, measures of
subjective probabilities. We have chosen to focus on these probabilities because much
more is know about what constitutes reasonable answers than to the other subjective
probabilities both with respect to level and to how they covary with other observable
data.

3. Probabilities of living to 75 or 85.
For population comparisons, our sample is restricted to the age range 51-61. and
3

we use sampling weights to account for oversampling of blacks, Hispanics and Floridians.
For analysis we use a sample of men aged 5 1-65 and women aged 46-61, and who were

not represented by a proxy interview. We realize that outside of the age range 51-61, the
sample is not representative of the population because a respondent must be a spouse ot
an age-etigible person. Nonetheless, we wanted more age variation than in the ageeligible sample, particularly because we want to find how the subjective probabilities vary

as age approaches 65 or 75. Furthermore, about 23% of the sample is outside the age
range 5 1-61, which is a large fraction to drop in the absence of a compelling reason.2

We have 7946 observations that we will use for the results in this section. This is
based on the responses to P!ive75. (We have slightly fewer responses to Plive85). The
response rate in the entire survey to Plive75 and Plive85 is about 98%.
3.1. Comparisons with life tables
We begin by comparing in Table 1 Plive7S and PliveS5 with averages from lile

tables. PliveS5 is less than Plive7S, and Plive85 given Plive7S, is 0.66. The levels of
Plive7S averaged over men and women are close to the averages in the 1988 life table,

but the Plive8S are higher than those from the life table3 Taking the life table as the
relevant comparison, men substantially over-estimate the probability they will live to 85,

and women under-estimate the probability they will Jive to 75. As a consequence, both
over-estimate the conditional probability of living to 85 given alive at 75.

There have been substantial reductions in mortality risk over a number of years,

and the reductions are expected to persist. It is relevant, therefore, to wonder how
people form their expectations about the length of life and how the expectations might
vary from cohort to cohort. The second part of the table has estimates of the probability

2For analysis we often would like to know ila model seems to hold for any population provided the
population was not chosen either to favor or disfavor the model. Based on this reasoning we imagine ihat
most analyses will be able to use the part oldie HRS outside oldie age range 51-61.

number

of men or women at each age in our MRS sample. The age range is 51-61.

of living to 75 or 85 from age 55. The last three lines come from, respectively, a 1980

life table (based on observed age-specific mortality rates in 1980), a 1988 life table, and
a 2000 life table, which is, of course, based on forecasts of changes in mortality risk. The
changes are substantial, which makes it difficult to know what is a good standard of
comparison;

the 1988 life table is the product of age-specific mortality rates in 1988,

which could be quite different from the age-specific mortality risks the HRS population
anticipates. From this point of view, even the "overestimatC of PliveSS by men could be
a reasonable projection. At a minimum we would expect the HItS sample to give higher
rates of Plive75 and especially PliveSS than the 1988 life table because

of cohort effects.

Figure 1 has the distributions of Plive7S and Plive8S. They have considerable
bunching at 0, 0.5 and 1.0. An interpretation is that people choose

one of the three

points according to whether they are rather confident, not confident at all, or uncertain

about living to 75 or 85. However, there are mini-spikes at 0.2 and 0.8, and particularly
for Plive8S, considerable mass at other points. Iii our view the distribution cannot be
reduce much further without the possible loss of considerable information.

In Figure 2. we have, for the moment, extended our sample to include men aged
46 to 74, and, in Figure 3, women aged 38-65. We did this to get the greatest possible
age range. As a reminder of the thin sample at ages far from the HRS age range, we

show the distribution of observations at the bottom of the graph. The avenges by age of
Plive75 and PliveS5 are compared with estimates of Plive7S and PliveSS from the 1988

life table. As we saw earlier Plive8S is considerably greater than the life table estimates.
What is most notable is that the age-paths of Plive7S and PIive8S are rather flat except
at ages above about 64, when they rise rather sharply. Figure 3 shows age paths of
Plive75 and Plive85 for women. The paths are flat and possibly even declining before
50.

If mottaiity risk is stationary over time and there were no heterogeneity in the
population, these paths should slope upward, reflecting that the probability of dying in

any year is positive. It is unlikely, however, that either of these conditions is met.

4We only use the extended sample for these two graphs.
5

Figure 4 shows Plive75 as a function of age estimated from the 1980, 1988 and 2000 life
tables, and Figure 5 shows PliveS5. It is certainly reasonable to imagine that the upward

shift has been so rapid that cohorts in their early 50's could have conditional
probabilities of living to 75 that are about the same as older cohorts. For example, if a
50 year-old man uses the year 2000 life table to form probabilities, his estimate of
Plive7S would be about 0.6. II a 62 year-old uses the 1988 life table his estimate would

be about 0.62.
At greater ages the slope of the conditional probability curve becomes steep, so

that the shift is not important, and the cohort effect will be negligible. The age pattern
of Plive75 implied by this example is about what we saw in Figure 2. The effect of the
upward shift is even greater on PliveSS (Figure 5). The same comparison we just made
would lead to a declining PliveSS in cross-section data. This is roughly what we observed

in Figures 2 and 3.
We do not know how people form their subjective probabilities about living to 75
or 85. But the rapid change in mortality risk leads us to conclude that a declining path

of Plive75 and Plive8S with age, especially at younger ages, can be consistent with our
thinking of them as probabilities.

3.2. Internal consistency
Although we may not want to make predictions about how Plive7S or PliveS5 vary

across individuals by age, we can make predictions about the relationship between them

at the individual level: in that each individual has a positive probability of dying
between 75 and 35 should he live to 75, Plive75 should be greater than Plive8S for each
individual. Figure 6 has estimates of the mean of PliveSS given P11ve75. It is just the

avenge of Plive85 over all those who gave a particular value of Plive75. For eference
the figure shows the 45 degree line. The graph shows that Plive85 given Plive75 is less

than Plive7S, and the difference increases with Plive7s. Therefore, on average PliveSS
given Plive75 lies between zero and one.

Table 2 has information about the joint responses. These figures and those in the
6

rest of this sectioa are based on our sample of women 46-51 and men 5 1-65. About 70%

of the individuals have Plive7S greater than

PliveSS.

If we add in the zeros as

reasonable answers, we have about 77% of the sample whose responses satisfy either
Plive7S > PliveS5 or both probabilities are zero. It is not clear how much one should be
disturbed by the other cases: the ties could be explained by uninformed guessing by the

respondent or observation error, which would have to be modelled by an analyst. We
fmd the 2.5% with Plive7S <PliveSS and the 9.2% with Plive7S = PliveSS = 1.0 more
worrisome: they constitute 11.7% of the sample that may not have understood the

of the question. However, the response rate to the probability questions is very
high, and it should be clear that there is information even in these lowest quality
nature

responses.

All variables derived from household interviews have inconsistencies and

observations error. We conclude that the inconsistencies in Plive7S and Plive8s are

tolerable and that their inconsistencies and errors are probably no larger than those of
many other variables such as household wealth.

Figures 7-10 have examples of the conditional distribution of Plive8S. Figure 7
gives the distribution of Plive8S given that Plive7S = 0.2. In about 90% of the cases

Plive8s is less than 0.2. Figure 8 (PlivelS=0.5) has some bunching at 0.5: apparently in
the face of considerable uncertainty some simply answered 50-50 to the questions.

Again, this does not mean the responses have no information.
As shown in Figure 9, most of the respondents who gave Plive7S =0.8 gave smaller

values for PliveSS; just 2.8% gave higher values.

Fig 10, which has the responses over those with Plive7S= 1.0 (22% of the sample),
shows that a large percentage of them, 42%, said Plive8S is also equal to 1.0. It is, of
course, possible that these are optimistic people, and that they act as if their probabilities

of surviving to 75 or 85 are close to one. However, it is quite likely that some did not
understand the question, and, had they not been bound by the scale (which they had as a

visual cue) they would have answered with numbers larger than one. We shall have to
wait in the panel to see if these probabilities change with changes in life events.
We thought that with age the responses might become more heterogeneous: as

people get new information about their health status and as they age toward 75, they
7

may either become convinced they will live to 75 or convinced they will not live. Thus,
rather than the avenge being composed of everyone having the population probability, it

would be composed of a fraction with probability one and another fraction with

probability zero so that the fractions avenged to the population probability. If such a
process happens with age the variance of Plive75 and PliveSS should increase with age.

We studied the variation in the standard deviation of Plive7S and Plive8S as a function
of age, but we could not see any pattern.5
We conclude that, although there is some internal inconsistency, broadly speaking
the observations on Plive75 and PliveS5 act like probabilities, and, given the changes in

life tables over time, they aggregate to reasonable levels.
3.3. Covariation with other variables.
Even with changing mortality risk from cohort to cohort, at least the sign of the
variation of Plive7S and Plive85 with risk factors should remain constant. For example,
someone who smokes should have a lower probability of living to 75 than someone from

the same cohort who does not smoke. Avenging the probabilities over smokers and
nonsmokers will reveal that difference,b A difference will be found after avenging over
cohorts unless the incidence of smoking varies substantially with cohorts and there is a

change in cohort-specific mortality risk. It is beyond the scope of this papeç to study
changes in risk factors by cohort, so we will assume that the incidence of risk factors is
roughly constant.
In the analysis to follow we will find differences in Plive7S and in PliveS5 as risk

factors vary. It will help our understanding if we can translate a change in a probability
into something with which we are more familiar such as a change in life expectancy. For
5This is complicated by the mean and variance of the probabilities not in general being independent:
just as in binomial sampling, the maximum variance is at a probability of O.5;but, of course, the variance in
Ptive7S and PIiveSS wilt be zero iIeveryone has a probability of 0.5.
61k difference in probabilities does not require a causal relationship between smoking and longevity,onty
that the correlations among observed and wiobserved variables be similar in the population and in the FIRS.

8

example, in the 1988 life table Plive75 is 0.59 for the men in our sample. Suppose it
were 0.03 higher among nonsmokers than among nonsmokers. Is this difference large?

We can get a rough idea in terms of live expectancy as follows. Among men, the
probability of living to 75 from 55 is about 0.59 and of living to 74 is 0.62. If a 55 yearold man has a Plive7S of 0.62, he believes his chances of living to 75 are the same as the

chances of a random 55 year-old living to 74. A way to construct his individual life table

is simply to shift the population life table by a year so that the population probability of
living to 74 is now his probability of living to 75, and to make the probability that he will

live to 56 equal to 1.0. Then his life expectancy, the integral under the life table
function, is the integral from age 56 up plus the integral from 55 to 56. The first part is
the same as the life expectancy of the 55 year-old population and the second part is 1.0.
Therefore, thre change in life expectancy is one year. We will take this approximation.

In that the life expectancy of a 55 year-old male is about 22 years, a 0.03 change
in PlivelS on a base of 0.59 will change life expectancy by about 5%. Among 55 yearold women, a change of 0.02 in Plive75 (on a base of 0.74) wiU change life expectancy

by a year, which is about 4%. Both of these "elasticities are fairly close to one.
Although a change in Plive8S of 0.03 is a larger proportionate change than in Plive75, its

effect on the life expectancy of men is about the same, one year. Among women,
because the PliveS5 curve has a steeper slope, an increase of a year in life expectancy
requires an increase of about 0.04 in Plive8S. We will use these rough approximations as
a guide in assessing the importance of a change in PlivelS or Plive85 as risk factors
change.

It is well known that mortality risk varies with a number of indicators of socio-

economic status: education, wealth and income to name but a few. Table 3 has Plive7S
and PliveS5 by wealth quartiles, and indeed, the variation is substantial: taking a linear
extrapolation of the relationship between Plivel5 and life expectancy the difference in
life expectancies between the first and fourth quartiles is abut five years; according to
Plive85 it is about two years.
The variation by education level is about the same (Table 4) with approximately
the same implications for life expectancy.

9

The HRS respondents were asked to give a self-assessment of their health. Table

S has the distribution of responses in our working sample and the avenges of Plive7S
and PliveS5 by health status. The variation is enormous: Plive7S ranges from 0.34 to
0.75 among men and 0.40 to 0.78 among women, and with similar variation in PliveSS.

This is roughly a difference in life expectancy of 13

years at age 55.

Within health categories, Plive75 and PliveSS are higher among women than
among men. Women have fewer risk factors such as smoking, and

there are surely other

unobserved determinents of longevity that vary by sex even holding constant health
status.

Tables 6 and 7 show the life probabilities

as a function of smoking and drinking.
Smoking, of course, is a risk factor in the population, and that is found in PlivelS and
PliveSS. Furthermore, the difference between "never smoked" and "not now" (but in the
past) is rather small just as it is in the population. In epidemiological data, moderate
drinking is associated with greater longevity, and heavy drinking (five or more drinks per

day) with substantially lessened longevity. This

is precisely what is found in Plive75 and

Plive8s.

8 has the avenges of the life probabilities by health and education.
Because of the positive correlation between health and education the effects of
Table

education on the life probabilities is much smaller than when health is not kept constant.
For example, at health levels of good or very good (where most of the observations lie)
Plive7S varies by just 0.03 or 0.04 with eduction level, and PliveSS be even less. Yet,

within education level they vary with health status by about as much as they do in Table
5.
We have similar results when we interact health status with smoking status, or

with income or wealth quartiles. Within health categories the variation in the
probabilities of living is much smaller than in Tables 3 and 6; yet, among smokers or
within an income or wealth quartile, the probabilities vary substantially with health
status. Apparently the main result of smoking is to change self-assessed health (and
actual health), which, in turn, changes life expectancy. The main effect of income or
wealth is to signal differences in health status.
10

Within the health categories "good or "very good" moderate drinking has only
very small effects (Table 9). Yet, the difference between heavy drinking and moderate

drinking is about as large in Table 7, which has no control for health status. Possibly
heavy drinkers whose health is very good anticipate a decline in health status and they

have incorporated that into their subjective probability distributions. The overall
variation in Plivel5 and Plive85 in the table is remarkably large, and the variation is
both internally and externally consistent. For example, Plive7S is 0.74 among those who

do not drink at all and are in excellent health; it is 0.30 among those who are heavy
drinkers and in poor health. This kind of variation (large and consistent) increases our
confidence that these subjective probabilities will be good predictors of actual mortality
outcomes.

Although the cross-tabulations are suggestive and in accord with what is known

from epidemiological data, we would like to know better the source of variation in
Plive7S and PliveS5. We do this with linear regressions of Plive7S and PliveSS on
measures of socio-economic status, personal characteristics, risk factors, diseases, and
self-assessed health status.

Table 10 has two sets of estimated coefficients. The first has observable variables

on the right-hand side; the second has, in addition, health status. We first discuss the
coefficients in the first column, the results when health status is excluded?

Income has a small, not significant coefficient; wealth has a small coefficient with
a t-statisuic just over 1.95. We say these are small in that the variation in Plive75
explained by the coefficients on income and wealth as income and wealth vary across

quartiles is small compared with the actual variation across the quartiles (Table 3).

The change with age is much smaller than what is found in a life table: here 10
years change Plive7S by about 0.04 compared with about 0.15 in the 1988 life table. We
have already discussed how cohort effects could account for the difference.

The measures of physical activity (normalized at three or more per week)

Tlle sundard errors do not change by much

when

in the table.
11

health status is excluded, so we do not repofl them

apparently classify people into those who are physically activity and those who are not.
Not being physically active reduces Plive7S by 0.04 to 0.06, and it matters little if the

physical activity is light or heavy. The result, of course, does not imply that exercise will
increase longevity because health status will influence both whether people are physically
active and longevity.

Both smoking, drinking and education have smaller effects than in the crosstabulations.

The incidence or prevalence of diseases affects Plive7S as would be expected and

the effects are large: all are negative, and many of them reduce life expectancy by 2-4
years in our metric. For example, ever having had cancer or malignant tumor reduces
Plive7S by 0.072, which reduces life expectancy for women by about 3.6 years. To the

extent smoking affects life expectancy by causing these diseases, including them in the
regression will attenuate the effects of smoking, which is what we observe.

Adding the health variables increases the R2 from 0.094 to 0.158: apparently

people use information that is not observable in answering both the question about
health status and about the subjective probability distributions.
Income and wealth now have very small coefficients (second column of Table 10).
The physical activity variables are not very important with the exception of the difference
between never having any heavy physical activity and having some more than once a

month. As before, we imagine that the difference is not causal, but simply ;etlect.s that
people who are not physically active often are not able to be physically active. Never
having physical activity simply provides finer detail on a measure of health than thc five
categories "excellent' to "poor."
The health variables have very large coefficients: Plive7S differs by 0.35 between
excellent and poor health even though we have a number of socio-economic variables
and nine disease indicators in the regression. This is probably about half of life
expectancy at age 55.
Among the diseases all the coefficients are smaller in absolute magnitude, and

only cancer has a significant coefficient. Apparently most of the effect of diseases on the
subjective probabilities works through their effect on self-assessed health.
12

Table 11 has corresponding results for PliveSS. The effects of the variables are

generally smaller than in the estimated regression of Plive7S. The exception is diseases:
for example the effect of ever having had heart problems is -.069 on Plive7S and -.097 on

Plive85. As before1 including the health variables reduces the importance of the other
risk factors.

Genetic factors also help determine life expectancy, and the age at which parents

die is an important indicator of the genetic predisposition to longevity. We imagine,

however, that the functional relationship between the parents' age at death and the
child's mortality risk is rather complicated. In that the leading cause of death at an early
age is accidents, the effects of the very early death of a parent on Plive7S or PIiveSS will

probably be qualitatively different from the effects of a later death. In particular, the

effect will not be monotonic in the age of the parents' death. We allow for this with a
set of categorical and continuous variables in each parent's age, if alive, and in each

parent's age at death, if dead.
Table 12 has selected coefficients from a regression that includes parents' age if
alive and parents' age at death if dead. The table also shows the distribution of the
parents' mortality status.t
Adding 14 variables about the parents' age or age of death increased the R2 from
0.158 to 0.185. This is roughly comparable to the increase from adding the self-assessed

health variables. The coefficients on the other variables are little changed by adding the
variables on the parents. For example, the difference in Plive75 associated with a
difference in health status of "excellent' to "poor" is -.035, the same as it was when the

parents' variables were excluded (Table 10).

The reference is someone whose parents died at age 65. The regressions have
two types of variables: categorical variables, which are indicated in the table by a (1),

and variables that are continuous in either the parents' age or age of death. The ages
are normalized to be zero at 65. If the mother is alive (44% of the observations),

do not show coefficients on 32 other variables that were included in the regressions. The
coefficients changed very little from what were reported in Tables 10 and 11.

13

Plive7S is predicted to be 0.073 greater (the coefficient on *mother alive categorical
variable) than if the mother had• died at 65 , and it increases by 0.W14 for each year of
the mother's age. Thus if she is alive and is 85, Plive7S is greater by 0.101 than if she
had died at age 65. If the mother died before age 51(7% of the observations), PJive7S

is higher by 0.038 than if she had died at age 65. We imagine this is a reflection that
early (accidental) deaths of parents do not affect probabilities of death of the child later

in life. If the mother died between 51 and 64, Plive75 is almost

the

same as if her death

had been at age 65. If the mother has died, her age at death increases Plive75 by 0.0039
per year, so that if she died at 85, Plive7S will be higher by 0.078 than if she had died at

age 65. This is, of course, a rather large difference in Plive7S: about two and a half
years in life expectancy for men and almost four in the life expectancy for women. The
other categorical variables cover missing data on parents' age and age at death, and
while the coefficients can be large, the categories are not important in our sample.

The effects of the father's age or age at death are similar to those of the mother.
For example if the father died at 85 rather than at age 65, Plive7S would be 0.092
greater.

It seems clear from these results that the respondents are aware that the age of
their parents or the age of their parents' death has an influence on their own mortality
risk and that they alter their reports on Plive75. The effects are large, particularly
because the regressions control for self-assessed health, which is probably associated with
the lifetime health status of the parents and their age at death.
The regression of PliveSS on the variables describing parents' age or age of death
is similar. The R2 increased from 0.134 to 0.168. As with Plive7S the health effects are

about the same as when the parents' variables were excluded. The effects of disease are
attenuated, and the effects of the parents' variables on Plive8S are similar to the effects
on Plive75.

In these regressions no distinction was made between male and female
respondents beyond a categorical variable for sex. Yet it is certainly plausible that males
tend to form their expectations about longevity more from their father's age or age of
death and females from their mother's age or age of death. To find if this is the case,
14

we estimated the regression of Plive7S separately for each sex. We used the same set of
50 right-hand variables as in Table 12.
Table 13 shows just the coefficients on the variables describing the parents' age or

age of death. Among females, Plive7S is increased by 0.082 if the mother is alive; yet

by only 0.46 if the father is alive. Among males, Plive75 is increased by 0.068 if the
father is alive and 0.047 if the mother is alive. This is just one example

of the

remarkable symmetry in the table: the coefficients on the mother's variables in the
regressions over the data on females are about the same as the coefficients on the

father's variables in the regressions over the data on males. For example, among women
Plive7S increases by 0.0060 in the age of the mother's death; among men Plive7S

increases by 0.0061 in the age of the father's death. In both cases the effects are

considerably larger than the effects of the mother's age on the son's probability or the
father's age on the daughter's probability.
This is summarized in Figures 11 and 12 which show the fitted values of Plive7S

from the regressions. Among men Plive7S varies much more in the variables associated

with the father than with the mother. Furthermore, the fitted probability is about the
same whether the father reached his 80's and then died, or is still alive in his 80's. This
is reasonable because of the high mortality risk among men in their 80's. The fitted

values of Plive7S for women look almost like the fitted values for men except for the
mother" and "father" labels. This brings out rather clearly the symmetry of the

coefficients in Table 13.

4. Probability of working
For studying the probabilities of working full-time past 62 or 65 (Pwork62 and
Pworkó5), we use the sample of full-time workers (hours of work greater than or equal
to 35 per week)

is

aged 51-61 because the transition from part-time work to full-time work

not common in this age group,

and

because part-time jobs have rather different

characteristics from full-time jobs (Hurd, 1993).
We reported in section 2 the language of the questions we use to construct
15

Pwork62 and Pwork65. We resealed the responses to the interval [0,1] and treated them
as probabilities. Generally we will think of them as conditional probabilities: the

probability of working full-time at 62 or 65 given working full-time at age t. It should be

apparent, however, that the question has ambiguity: it could refer to working full-time
anytime after the 62nd birthday or it could refer to working sometime after the
respondent is no longer 62. As we will see, some respondents seemed to have the first

interpretation and some the second.
It is much less straightforward to find population data to compare with Pwork62
and Pwork65 in the way we compared

life table data with PlivelS and Plive8S, but we

will make two comparisons. The method behind the first is shown in Table 14. We have
estimated the fraction of the population 55-59 working full-time and the fraction aged 63

working full-time from estimates of the fraction of full-time workers among all workers,
and from labor force participation rates. According to this calculation the

probability of

working full-time at age 63 conditional on working full-time at ages 55-59 is 0.246+0.537

= 0.457. The avenge of Pwork62 over the 55-59 year-old full-time workers in the HRS
is 0.478, which is remarkably close and

which should increase our confidence that

Pwork62 and Pwork65 measure conditional probabilities of working.

We can make an additional comparison based on the HRS data by using the
observations of 62 and 63 year-old males who were interviewed but are not in the age-

eligible population. They are husbands of age-eligible wives, and while they are not
exactly representative of the 62 and 63 year-old male population (having to be married
to younger women to be in the survey) we imagine they are sufficiently representative to
give good estimates of the conditional probability of working full-time. We estimate the

probability of working full-time at age 62 conditional on working full-time at e from the
fraction of the HRS married males aged 62 who are working full-time and the fraction oF
the FIRS married males working full-time at age t.

Figure 13 shows the average of Pwork62 of married males by age, and our

estimates of the conditional probability of working full-time given full-time work at each
of the ages 5 1-61. We show both the conditional probability of working to 62 and to 63
because

of ambiguity in the FIRS question:

as

16

discussed above, it is not clear whether

the question refers to age 62 or age 63. Pwork62 is bounded by our estimates and has a

modest but smaller upward trend. We conclude that the average of Pworkó2 is
reasonably close to population avenges and to conditional probabilities calculated from
the frequencies of full-time work in our sample.
Figure 14 has the distributions of Pworkó2 and Pwork6s. They have considerably
less bunching at 0.5 than Plive7S and PIiveS5 and larger peaks at 0 and one. This is
reasonable because respondents have considerable control over their work status, and

many have decided either definitely to work past 62 or definitely not to. Some in the
middle have not decided or they face greater random events than those who

The conditional distribution of working (Pworkó5 given Pwork62) is quite similar
to the conditional distribution of Plive85: as in Figures 6-10, Pworkó5 is on average less
than Pwork62, and most respondents give smaller values for PworkóS than for Pwork62.

An interesting difference is in Figure 15, which is a graph of Pwork65 given that

Pwork62 = 1.0. It shows that a substantial number of workers are certain of working
past age 62 and certain of retiring before age 65. This corresponds to what we know

about actual retirement: the retirement hazards are high at age 62 and very high at age

65. Many people plan to work until Social Security benefit eligibility (age 62) and then

retire. Most of those who plan to work until 65 when they are eligible for full Social
Security benefits, retire shortly after their 65 birthday.
Table 15 has our check for internal consistency. Unlike the case with Plive75 and
PliveSS, a probability of zero or one can be appropriate. The sum of the percentage

giving those probabilities and of the percentage with Pwork62 > Pwork65 is 88.9%. Just
1.6% have Pwork62 <Pwork65.
The HRS asked workers if they had made plans or thought about retirement, and
if so at what age did they plan to retire completely, change jobs, reduce hours, or
become self-employed. If Pwork62 and Pwork65 are informed probabilities, we would
expect that they would vary according to whether someone has thought about retirement.

9There are, of course, random events that affect retirement: health, layoff, and Iinancial gains and
losses, to name but several.
17

Figure 16 shows the fraction of workers that have not thought about retirement

and the avenge of Pwork62 according to whether workers have or have not thought
about retirement. The percentage that has not thought about retirement (37.7 percent
over all ages) falls steadily with age from over 50 percent at age 51 to about 24 percent

by age 61. Among those who have not thought about retirement, Pwork62 is rather

steady except at age 61. At that age someone who has not thought about retirement and
who therefore has no plans, probably has little choice but to continue to work.
Accordingly Pwork62 increases to about 0.73.

It is likely that people do not think about retirement until several years before a
possible retirement age. Therefore those who have thought about retirement are closer
to their actual year of retirement. This means that workers in their early 50's who have
thought about retirement will have small Pwork62. Workers in their late 50's who have
thought about retirement will have higher Pworkó2 because some plan to retire after age
62. The figure shows such an age pattern among those who have thought about
retirement.

This view has the implication that the weighted avenge of Pwork62 (over those

who have and have not thought about retirement) could be rather stable with age: until
workers are in their late 50's the most important change in Pwork62 at the individual
level is a decline that accompanies the switch from not having thought about retirement
to having thought about it. The evolution in Pworkó2 conditional on having thought

about retirement could be rather minor. This means that the avenge variation by age
does not represent the evolution in Pwork62 of an individual: it is the result of changing
heterogeneity in the population with age.

It is well known that pension plans affect retirement. Defined benefit plans (DB),
and to a lesser extent defined contribution plans (DC), affect retirement through the
details of the structure of the plan. Typically DR plans have an age at which reduced

pension benefits could be paid, and an age at which full benefits could be paid. Usually
workers will not want to leave the firm a few years before those ages. Particularly after
the age for full benefits, it often does not pay to remain with the firm, so many workers
retire soon after qualifying for full benefits.
18

Table 16 has Pworkó2 and Pworkó5 classified by pension availability and by the

details of the age of eligibility.1 Having a DC plan reduces Pwork62 by about 0.04.
However, if the earliest age for eligibility is greater than 62, Pwork62 increases to 0.64,
which is considerably greater than Pwork62 of those with no pension. This effect is

similar to the effect of Social Security on retirement at age 62, which is thought to act
through a liquidity constraint.

Most workers with DB plans are eligible for full pensions benefits before the age
of 62, and their Pwork62 is about 0.23 less than workers with no pension (Table 16).
Among workers who must wait until 62 for a reduced or full benefit the probability
increases by 0.11 to 0.41. If they must wait until age 65, their probability of working past

age 62 increases to 0.67, which is greater than among workers with no pension. Thus,

Pwork62 more than doubles as the age at which full benefits can be taken varies. The
table shows similar variation in Pwork62 and Pwork65 as other details of the DB pension
plan change. The variation is almost completely consistent with our knowledge of the
effects of DB plans on actual retirement.

Figure 17 is based on an extract from Table 16. It shows among workers whose
age for reduced benefits is less than 62 the variation in the probabilities of working as

the age for full benefits varies. The effects are large, particularly when the age for full
benefits increases from 62 to 65: apparently many workers plan to stay on the job past

age 62 until they qualify for full benefits. If the age for full benelits is greater than 65,
Pwork65 increases from 0.21 to 0.2$; yet Pwork62 changes by very little. This illustrates

the sensitivity of retirement plans to the details of DB pension plans.
5. Conclusion

Our criteria for judging the measures of subjective probabilities in the HRS were
that they are good approximations to population probabilities, that they are internally
consistent, and that they covary with other variables in the same way as in other data.

7We use information on the pension of the present job only.

19

On average the probabilities of living to 75 or 85 are close to avenges in a lifetable
from 1988. However, in view of the rapid change in mortality rates, it is not really clear
how close they should be because we do not know how cohorts form their views about

mortality risk.

Labor force participation rates have been stable for a number of years, implying

that retirement behavior has been stable. Therefore, the mean of Pwork62 should be
close to the population avenge, at least when compared with the difference between

Plive7S and a population probability from a life table. Indeed, the HRS measure of the
subjective probability of working full-time past 62 is within several percentage points of a
population estimate.

The subjective probabilities are in general internally consistent. To the extent
that they are not, an analyst should model the process that causes the inconsistency.
The process surely includes observation error, and in this regard is no different from
almost all economic variables. Usually, however, the respondent and the analyst share a
common understanding of the meaning of a survey question. This is undoubtedly not
always true for the questions about subjective probabilities, and that difference needs to
be taken into account.
The sharpest test of the subjective probabilities comes from their covariation with
other variables. The probabilities of living to 75 or 85 vary in a systematic and
reasonable way with diseases, socio-economic status, self-assessed health, anØ indicators

of family longevity. The probabilities of working past 62 or 65 vary with personal,
financial and job variables in ways that are consistent with what has been found in other

data. On avenge, therefore, the subjective probabilities will correctly predict some of
the variation in outcomes. For example, workers with defined benefit pensions will
retire earlier than workers without pensions, and because workers with defined benefit
plans have lower subjective probabilities of working past 62, small values of Pwork62 will

correctly predict early retirement. Of course, what we hope is that conditional on
observable characteristics, the subjective probabilities will be good predictors of
retirement, which will allow us to observe and control for individual heterogeneity.

Finding whether this happens will require observations in the panel data. From the
20

cross-section, however, we conclude that the measures of subjective probabilities in the

HRS show great promise for making a substantial contribution to our understanding of
decision making under uncertainty.
