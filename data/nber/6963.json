Because that market exhibits many complementarities between applicants and between positions, the theory of simple matching markets does not apply directly.  However, computational experiments reveal that the theory provides a good approximation, and furthermore the set of stable matchings, and the opportunities for strategic manipulation, are surprisingly small. A new kind of  core convergence' result is presented to explain this; the fact that each applicant can interview for only a small fraction of available positions is important.  We also describe in detail engineering aspects of the design process.\n\n",
