    "abstract": "\n\nIn periods of high energy demand, utilities frequently issue \"emergency\" appeals for conservation over peak hours to reduce brownout risk. We estimate the impact of such appeals using high-frequency data on actual and forecasted electricity generation, pollutant emission measures, and real-time prices. Our results suggest a perverse impact; while there is no significant reduction in grid stress over superpeak hours, such calls lead to increased off\u000b-peak generation, CO2 emissions, and price volatility. We postulate that consumer attempts at load shifting lead to this result.\n\n",
