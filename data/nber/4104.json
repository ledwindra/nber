We estimate the parameters representing habit persistence or durability. risk version and time preference for each of the countries. We find that time-nonseparable preferences improve the fit of the model. When the nonseparability parameter is statistically significant. its magnitude indicates that the effect of habit persistence dominates the effect of durability in consumption expenditures. However. the international evidence for habit persistence is weaker than it is for the United States. The results indicate that the simple model of time nonseparability does not provide a satisfactory explanation of consumption and asset returns.\n\n",
