    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines evidence on employment practices in the U.S. with respect to race and the impact of governmental anti-bias activity on these practices. It shows a striking difference in the responses of American employers to job applications differing in race from the responses of British employers and asks whether these differences can be attributed to the greater U.S. effort to aid minority workers. It reviews the recent research by Jonathan Leonard on the effect of court suits and affirmative action compliance activity and concludes that much of the improved status of minorities in the U.S. is indeed due to governmental activity and public policy.\n\n",
