This paper proposes an econometric methodology to deal with life cycle
earnings and mobility among discrete earnings classes. First, we use panel
data on male log earnings to estimate an earnings function with permanent and
serially correlated transitory components due to both measured and unmeasured
variables. Assuming that the error components are normally distributed,
we develop statements for the probability that an individual's earnings will
fall into a particular but arbitrary time sequence of poverty states. Using
these statements, we illustrate the implications of our earnings model for
poverty dynamics and compare our approach to Markov chain models of income
mobility.

1. INTRODUCTION

Is poverty a transitory status or a permanent condition of individuals

and households? More broadly, is there a high or low degree of mobility
over time in an individual's place in the distribution of earnings or a house-

hold's place in the distribution of income? The increasing availability of
longitudinal data files containing information on individual and family earnings,
income, personal characteristics and environmental variables together with a
growing body of theoretical literature on life cycle behavior have greatly

enhanced the capacity of economists to answer such questions. The purpose of
this paper is to propose an econometric methodology that may serve as a link

between theory and data on the dynamic aspects of earnings and of income
distributions.

this paper ——

In the case of earnings mobility ——

the

case considered in

it has the added advantage of providing a direct linkage with

traditional human capital earnings functions.

Although human capital earnings functions are cast in a life cycle framework, it is only rarely that the availability of longitudinal data has been

deemed crucial for their estimation. The reason for this can probably be traced
to the emphasis in these models on the paradigm of the "representative man."
This paradigm leads to an empirical emphasis on the effects of independent

variables on the mean earnings of an average individual and to a relative lack

of interest in individual differences.2 One consequence of this is that most
human capital earnings functions are incapable of describing the life cycle
dynamics of the earnings distribution; they simply describe the average growth
path of earnings for the representative individual.3

—2—

In contrast, longitudinal data have played an essential role in

several recent studies by economists of mobility among discrete income or

earnings classes. (McCall [1973], Levy [1975], Schiller [1976] Schorrocks [1976]).
A central question in these studies is the extent to which an individual retains
his position in the earnings or income distribution of his cohort over his

life cycle. From this point of view, cross-sectional income distributions are
susceptible to a wide vartety of interpretations. One extreme possibi1ity is
complete income stratification. In this case, knowledge of an individual's
position in the income distribution in a cross—sectional survey in year t
is a perfect predictor of his position in subsequent years. Levy [1976], for
example, argues that this interpretation of cross—section statistics on the
poverty population was implicit in the view of government poverty policy—

makers during the 1960's: Without outside help, an individual who is in poverty
cannot expect to get out of poverty. As Levy points points out, this possibility
cannot be distinguished in cross—section data from the possibility that poverty
is merely a transient status in which many of the individuals who are in poverty

In one year will be replaced by others who were initially out of poverty. Thus,
at the opposite extreme from complete income stratification is complete income

mobility in which an individual's probability of being in some discrete income
class (e.g., poverty or nonpoverty, a given decile of the earnings distribution,

etc.) in a given period is independent of his prior income status. While
neither of these extreme possibilities seems realistic, it is clear that longitudinal data on income or earnings are necessary to establish what reality is.
In this paper, we propose a fairly simple methodology to deal with life

cycle earnings and mobility among discrete earnings classes. First, we

—3—

estimate an earnings function with log male

earnings

as the dependent

variable, using seven years of earnings data from the University of Michigan

Income Dynamics Panel, 1967—73. We estimate permanent and serially correlated
transitory components of earnings due to both measured and unmeasured variables.

Measured variables are represented by an earnings function, while unmeasured

variables are represented by components of residual variance. Assuming that
the error components are normally distributed, the intertemporal distribution
of log earnings, conditional on measured variables, is multivariate normal with a

correlation matrix determined by the estimated components. The probability
that an individual's earnings will fall into a particular, but arbitrary time
sequence of discrete earnings classes is then computed by evaluating the
appropriate multivariate normal integral within the limits given by the definition of the earnings classes.4

It is important to point out that our approach to earnings mobility copes
quite easily with certain issues that have proven difficult in Narkov chain
mobility models such as those of Champernowne (1953), McCall (1973) and

Schorrocks (1976) which provide the major alternative methodology. First in
a Markov model It is necessary to define in advance the number and width of

the Income classes among which transitions take place. While, for example,
Champernowne's theory assumes an infinite number of classes of equal logarithmic length, data limitations necessitate a relatively small number of
classes to preserve ceilsize. In addition, policy interests may suggest focussing on
certain classes such as "poverty" because of their normative rather than their

behavioral significance. This presents a difficulty because a process which is
Markovian in a given state space need not be Markovian when states are

redefined (see Shorrocks, 1976). In our approach, the number and width of
Income classes may

be

defined arbitrarily. Second, Markov models present

—4—

some difficult and subtle statistical problems when transition probabilities

vary among observationally identical individuals (i.e. individuals with
identical measured characteristics) .

Because we estimate the components due

to unmeasured permanent and serially correlated components, we can deal with
this problem of population heterogeneity by computing directly the distribution

of probabilities of an arbitrary sequence of earnings states. Finally, our
approach allows transition probabilities to vary across people and over time
because of variations in measured variables or because of variations in the

definition of earnings classes. Thus, there is no need to assume that transition
probabilities remain constant over time, as is often done in the Markov models
(e.g. Shorrocks (1976)).

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we specify an
earnings function that utilizes all sample information about earnings and is

clearly linked to the life cycle earnings literature. By considering both
permanent and serially correlated transitory components as well as measured
variables that vary across time and people, we take fairly full account of

population heterogeneity. To some extent, serial correlation also captures
some of the effects of the arbitrary time frame of the data (i.e. yearly

earnings). In Section 3, we analyze the implications of this earnings function
for earnings mobility across discrete earnings classes. For simplicity, we
develop probability statements for two earnings classes. These probabilities
are illustrated empirically in Section 4 for transitions into and out of

poverty by blacks and whites. The state "poverty" is arbitrarily defined by a
poverty line equal to one—half the median of U.S. male earnings in each year.

For expositional convenience empirical probability statements used to illustrate the general methodology are based on a variance component model which
omits measured variables.

2. EMPIRICAL EARNINGS MODEL

The basic ingredient of our approach to earnings mobility is an

empirical earnings function. The purpose of this section is first to outline
the specification of the earnings function, its error structure and the
statistical methodology used to estimate it and, second, to present parameter
estimates based on seven years of earnings data from the Income Dynamics panel.

The earnings function is of the form

+

Y1 =

(2.1)

+

i1...,N; t1,...,T

is the natural logarithm of the real annual earnings (in 1970

where

dollars) of the ith person in the t-th year. Each person is observed each of

the same T years. Three successively more complex forms of this earnings
function will be estimated: the models including (1) r (i.e., time dummies)
only, (2) a conventional earnings function , X8, including race, education, labor

force experience and time effects and (3) a fairly comprehensive earnings
function, X, which includes such additional variables as detailed job histories,
geographical data, an index of local labor market conditions, union membership
and interactions of certain variables with time.

(A full list of these vari-

ables is given in the Appendix.)

The error structure is assumed to be of the following form.

(2.2)

and

is a random individual component ('s..

is a purely

random component (iid(0,)) and y is the serial correlation coefficient
counnon to all individuals. The variates

rL are assumed to be inde-

pendent of each other and of X1 and Ft. This error structure, which we
call the "autocorrelated individual component model," combines the features
of both the traditional variance component model of individual random effects
and first order autocorrelation over time net of the individual component.6

The individual component of this error structure, 6, represents the
effect of unnieasured individual variables in equation (2.1).

It may be termed

population heterogeneity in mean relative earnings and iill play a central

role in the analysis of the dynamics of poverty. In this section it will
be assumed that

is hoinogenous throughout the population. Later we will

illustrate heterogeneity over identifiable subgroups of the population with

respect to ci, a2 and •
The serial correlation term, y, may be interpreted in a couple of ways.
First, it reflects the effect of random shocks which persist longer than one

year but which deteriorate in effect over time. Second, it reflects the
operation of individual, unobserved variables which are serially correlated
over time, i.e., change slowly through time.

Time effects are estimated as fixed parameters (i.e., dummy variables).
While in equation (2.1) time effects are shown for simplicity to be the same

—7—

for all individuals, they are different for various Identifiable population

subgroups (e.g., race). Year effects capture the combined effect of time—
varying macroeconomic variables such as exogenous productivity changes,

market conditions, etc., that are not explicitly entered as exogenous vari-

ables In our model. In these data time effects are estimated directly,
rather than used as a random component, since there are only seven years

in the panel and more than six parameters are estimated leaving far too few
degrees of freedom for the latter procedure to be interpretable (See Nerlove
(1971]).

Assuming that initial earnings at the beginning of the work history
are shocked by an error of the form

The Data
The University of Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics represents
a panel of seven contiguous years, 1967—73. The survey included 5,517 households,
about 2,000 from the 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity and an additional 3,000

from a cross section of U.S. families. Since the SEO subsample selected by the
Survey Research Center for inclusion in the panel was not random with respect to income

this group is excluded from consideration.8 A detailed description of the data
is provided in Morgan (1974). The parameters of the model are estimated for the
1,041 white and 103 black persons identified as a male head of household (including
single persons) between the ages 18 and 58 in 1967 who were not disabled, retired
or a fuiltime student during the period and who reported positive annual hours

—9—

and earnings each year. Means and standard deviations of variables are presented
in Appendix Table Al. All earnings values are in real 1970 dollars.

Parameter Estimates
The parameters

and rt are estimated by OLS on the data pooled over

individuals and years.9 The parameters

a and y are estimated by maximum

likelihood from the OLS residuals)° Parameter estimates for the residual structure
are reported in Table 1 for alternative sets of independent variables including

(1) no independent variables, except rt,

(2) a simple set of independent

variables including only schooling, experience, race and r, and (3) a more
comprehensive set of independent variables including individual and job related char-

acteristics, some indicators of local market conditions, time and interactions.
First consider the components of variation in log earnings controlling
only for individual year differences, i.e.,

=

+

Since the variance

in the log of earnings is often used as an index of earnings inequality, these

components may be thought of as sources of earnings Inequality. Total within
year variance is .307. Permanent earnings differences among individuals
represent 73.1 percent of total variation. Of the 26.9 percent remaining stochastic
variation from period to period, 22.4 percentage points may be considered purely

stochastic variation, the remainder being due to serial correlation. The
permanent component may be interpreted as the effect of permanent differences

among individuals, some of which we observe and others that we do not. As noted
earlier, serial correlation may represent the effect of serially correlated
independent variables or the effect of transitory variables whose effects last

more than a year. We will observe some of these variables but not all. The

analysis but cannot be distinquished here.
Using estimates from the full model (p =

of earnings In adjacent years across individuals is p + (l—p)y = .840. It declines
to .775 for observations two years apart, .74.9 for three years apart, .738 for

four years and, asymtotically to .731. These values are represented graphically
by the solid line in Figure 1. Corresponding correlations from the simple variance

Our results indicate larger permanent and smaller transitory variances in

log earnings among blacks compared to whites. The black permanent component is
44 percent larger than the white value. Much of this racial differential in
permanent components is due to measured variables. Thus, controlling for a
comprehensive set of explanatory variables, the unmeasured permanent component

is only 14 percent larger for blacks. In contrast, the transitory component
is about 16 percent smaller among blacks compared to whites. Total earnings
variance is about 27 percent larger for blacks, but variance due to unmeasured
factors (both permanent and transitory) is almost Identical for blacks and whites

when the comprehensive set of explanatory variables are held constant.

Consider the role of measured variables in these components of earnings

variation.12 First consider simply Introducing race, years of schooling, and

years of work experience into the earnings function. The earnings function is
then

(2.9) 1=7'665 + .084 Sch + .038 Exp — .007 Exp2 — .166 Black + +

The B parameter estimates conform to
traditional estimates of many earlier studies. These variables explain 33
percent of total earnings variation but explain 44 percent of the permanent

component.13 As expected, these individualized variables explain none of the
stochastic variation. This fairly simple earnings function then does quite well
at explaining permanent earnings differences even though its performance would

appear somewhat poorer in cross—sectional estimates in which the permanent and

transitory components cannot be separated. Within racial groups, schooling and
experience alone explain 51 percent of the permanent component for blacks and

40 percent for whites. The corresponding figures for total earnings variation
are 41 percent and 29 percent respectively.

The overall explanatory power of the earnings function is increased to
50 percent when a fairly comprehensive set of measured variables are included.

The full list of variables and estimated coefficients are presented in an

appendix available from the authors. They include detailed job history data, an
index of local labor market conditions, union membership, and interactions of

certain variables with time to allow differential growth rates. A detailed
discussion of these parameter estimates would be interesting but is not appropriate

—12—

to the focus of this paper. Within racial groups the explanatory power of the
X variables and

is 58 percent for blacks and 47 percent for whites. This

is a consequence of the larger share of total variation due to permanent

differences for blacks and the greater explanatory power of these variables

with respect to the permanent component. The measured variables explain 46 percent
of total residual variation for whites and 53 percent for blacks. Of
total permanent variance, 73 percent Is due to measured variables for blacks

and only 65 percent for whites. The unmeasured permanent component accounts for
24 percent of total earnings variation for whites, 22 percent for blacks and 24

percent (including race) for the total population. Correspondingly, 71 percent
of total earnings variation is accounted for by measured variables plus permanent
differences among whites, 81 percent for blacks and 73 percent (including race)

for the total sample. This set of variables, some of which vary a bit with
2

time,

only slightly affect the estimate of purely stochastic variance, a

A rather weak aspect of even the fairly comprehensive set of variables used here

is that too few variables having transitory effects are observed. However, the
estimate of serial correlation is reduced from about .40 to .35 for each group
by this set of variables.

3. DYNAMIC ASPECTS OF POVERTY

In this section we develop mathematical expressions, based on the
earnings function and the components of variance, for the probability of observing a
given individual or group of individuals in any arbitrary sequence of poverty

states. To be in a state of poverty at a given time, an individual's earnings
must fall below some prespecified but arbitrary level. We also derive formulas
or the joint and conditional probabilities of poverty status in two or more

years and for the corresponding distributions of such probabilities over mdi—

—13—

viduals. The conditional probabilities are compared to analogous probabilities in Markov chain models of poverty dynamics. The empirical
counterparts of these formulas will be examined in Section 4. Although we

assume that ri and 6 are normally distributed, our approach could be used
to derive probability statements under less restrictive assumptions or assuming

alternative probability distributions for 6 and
The poverty level and the earnings class it defines are prespecif led

in the sense of being based on considerations outside the probability model

itself. Thus, this level, denoted as Y1, may vary from period to period
and across well—defined groups of individuals (e.g., by place of residence

or family size). And since the probability of being in poverty is invariant
over monotonic transformations of earnings, we may use the logarithm of
earnings directly.

Poverty Probabilities for an Individual

The Distribution of Poverty Probabilities Among Individuals
It is important to distinguish the, probability statements for individuals

in the previous section from probability statements for groups of observation—
ally identical individuals (i.e., individuals who share identical values of

Xe). The individual probability statements are conditional on a given value

of 6 while 6 varies across observationally identical individuals. This
generates a distribution of poverty probabilities among such individuals which

depends on the distribution of 5.
The distribution function of individual poverty probabilities

for

Aggregate Poverty Probabilities
The mean of the distribution of single year poverty probabilities corres-

ponds to the probability that a random,person in the group will be observed in

poverty and to the expected proportion of the group falling into poverty. Note,
however, that this probability is not generally equal to the single year poverty
probability of the "representative" or "median" individual (with tS

0).

Similarly, the probability of any given sequence of poverty states for the
representative individual is not equal to the probability of that sequence for

an individual chosen at random or to the expected proportion of the population
who follow that sequence, because of population heterogeneity caused by variation

When no serial correlation is

individual probabilities are inde-

pendent around an individual mean from period to period (and thus are a

product of cumulative normals), but aggregate probabilities are not, even
for observationally identical individuals, because of population heterogeneity.
This is the special case of population heterogeneity studied by Heckinan and

Willis [1975] in the context of conception probabilities.

Conditional Probabilities and Relationship to Markov Models
Using the probability statements for single years and pairs of years
developed above, it is easy to derive expressions for k—step poverty

—19—

transition matrices for a given individual (ó specified) or for a

group of observationally identical individuals (6 unspecified). The typical
element in a k—step transition matrix is the conditional probability of being

Since the serial correlation model implies that the intertemporal dis-

tribution of a given individual's earnings is Markovian (see Feller 1971, pp.
94—96), it is not surprising that the individual k—step transition probabilities
in our model share some of the same properties as the k—step transition

Despite these similarities, it should be noted that the transition
probabilities in our model are not Markovian because the individual's prob-

ability of poverty in period T is affected not only by his poverty state in

period t but also by his entire history of poverty states prior to t. This is an
example of thewellknown fact that a process that is Markovian inagLven state space

is nat nera1ly Markovian when states are aggregated.
In a group of observationally identical individuals, those who are in

poverty in t tend to be selected for low values of

S and conversely for

those out of poverty in t. Thus, in a heterogeneous population, knowledge
of an individual's poverty state at time t provides information about his
chances of being in poverty at all subsequent tImes.
The appropriate k—step transition probabilities for a group of observationally
identical individuals are equal to the ratio of the aggregate joint probability

of poverty (not poverty) in t and t divided by the aggregate probability
of poverty (not poverty) in t. For example.

It

follows that a random indi-

vidual chosen from among those who are in poverty in a given year will have
a greater chance of being in poverty in all subsequent years than an observa-

tionally identical individual chosen randomly from among those not in poverty
in that year.

Clearly, these transition matrices can be easily generalized to any

number of earnings states using the parameter estimates of the earnings

function and its error structure. In addition, the conditional probabilities
allow individual characteristics to vary across people and over time and also
allow the poverty definition to change.

Finally, joint and conditional probability statements can easily be

generalized to K arbitrary years. The probability of any sequence of events
(in or out of poverty) over years t1, t2,. .

is given by an equation

analogous to the two year equations with the intersection of the correspond-

ing events expanded to K periods. For example, the probability of being

4. EMPIRICAL POVERTY DISTRIBUTIONS AND EARNINGS DYNAMICS

In this section we briefly illustrate some of the concepts developed in
section 3, using parameter estimates from section 2.

Basic patterns are

illustrated using black/white comparisons. Because our purpose here is
to be illustrative, the probability concepts are explored empirically only
for the crudest earnings function in which no explanatory variables except
time dummies enter.

This form of the earnings function puts the entire

analysis in its worst possible light while emphasizing its power to predict
the qualitative features of the dynamics of poverty for individuals and groups.

This means that many interesting questions related to measured determinants of
earnings are not explored at all.
It is Important to Introduce the caveat that all of the probability
statements predicted from the model assume normality of

5

and

rì.

While

this assumption is not necessary it Is quite convenient analytically. Since
the probability statements reported in this paper relate to log earnings, it

—23—

it is appropriate to note that the actual distributions of Y1 for both
blacks and whites are leptokurtic and slightly negatively skewed relative
to normal curves with the same mean and standard deviation.'7 Much of the
discrepancy between actual and predicted probabilities can be traced to
non—normality.

We begin by comparing actual and predicted poverty sequences for black

and white aggregates. These probabilities include single—year poverty probabilities, joint and conditional probabilities for three adjoining years and

k—step transition probabilities for up to seven years. We also compare
the fraction of blacks and whites in permanent poverty (i.e., whose expected

value is the poverty state). The relationships between individual probabilities arid aggregate probabilities are then explored. First, we illustrate
the distribution of individual single—year and two—year joint poverty probabilities as a function of the permanent component 6 and then show the

distribution of such probabilities across individuals. Differences in
probabilities between an individual chosen at random from a population and

a hypothetical representative individual with 60 are used to illustrate
the effects of population heterogeneity.

Actual and Predicted Poverty Sequences

In our empirical illustrations, we define an individual from the Income

Dynamics panel to be in poverty in year t if his earnings, '1k' fall below

an arbitrary poverty line, Y, which is equal to one half median earnings of
male workers reported in the corresponding year in the Current Population

—24—

â

Survey. Since the estimated parameters

and - are all assumed to

remain constant over time and no explanatory variables except time dummies
are considered, the only source of temporal variation in predicted probabilities in our model is caused by time variation in

—

Y(crbj)

where Y

is mean log earnings of whites or blacks in the Income Dynamics panel8
Economy—wide productivity change tends to increase both

and Y; however,

since the Income Dynamics sample also increases its average level of labor
force experience over time,

tends to increase somewhat faster than Y.

Accordingly, the poverty threshold, Y —

Y,

which is tabulated in Table 2

for blacks and whites, tends to rise from 1967 to 1973.
The actual

and expected

fractions of blacks and whites in

poverty in each year 1967—73 are presented In Table 2, along with the percentage in permanent poverty

The expected aggregate poverty proba-

bilities are calculated using the probit function in equation (3.12) and the
parameter estimates of the log earnings model for whites and blacks in Table 1.

According to the predicted probabilities, p, a random black is over four times
as likely to be in poverty in a given year as is a random white. In large
part, this is caused by lower mean earnings for blacks, but to some extent

it is also the result of the higher variance of black earnings. For example,
in 1970 the black poverty probability is .089. If blacks had the same
earnings variance as whites, this probability would have been .066. The
decline of the white poverty probability from .028 to .019 and the black
probability from .138 to .083 over the period 1967—73 is the result of the
growth of mean earnings in the Income Dynamics sample relative to median male

eariiings in the CPS. Comparing Pt and p in Table 2, it is apparent that
our model predicts the fraction of whites in poverty fairly well, but over—
predicts black poverty to a moderate degree.
In Table 3, we present for whites and blacks the joint aggregate

probabilities of the eight possible sequences of poverty and nonpoverty
over the three—year period 1967—1969 together with the actual proportions

following these sequences. The joint probabilities are calculated by
evaluating a trivariate normal function according to (3.17) and are reported
using the notation P(H1967, H1968, H1969) where Ht equals one if not poverty
in year t and zero if poverty.20 Again, as in the case of single—year

probabilities, the model is a better predictor for whites than for blacks.
It is easy to see the extent to which population heterogeneity and serial
correlation (i.e.,

>

0,

y > 0) increase the probability of persistence in

poverty or nonpoverty for a random individual by comparing the values of
P(000) and P (111) in Table 3 with the product of single—year poverty (non—

poverty) probabilities in Table 2. For whites, the probability of three years
of poverty, P(000)=.0076, is over 100 times as large as the product of single—
year poverty probabilities, while the probability of three years out of
poverty, P(lll)=. 950, is only modestly larger than the product of probabil-

ities (.925). The corresponding comparisons for blacks are P(000).067 compared to .001 and P(lll)=. 807 compared to .726. Despite this persistence,

the three—year probabilities do indicate considerable mobility in and out of

poverty. Only 15 percent Of whites and 35 percent of blacks expected to
be in poverty at any time during 1967—1969 are expected to be in poverty in
all three years.

Given heterogeneity and serial correlation, knowledge of an individual's

poverty history is very useful in predicting his poverty status in a given year.

This is illustrated by considering predicted and actual aggregate poverty
probabilities for whites and blacks in 1969 (a) with no information about
poverty history, (b) conditional on poverty status in 1968 and (c) condi-

tional on poverty status in 1967 and 1968. These probabilities are presented
in Table 4 where, for example, P(69I".67, 68) is the probability of poverty

in 1969 given not poverty in 1967 and poverty in 1968. We shall confine our
discussion to predicted probabilities for blacks, since it is apparent from
inspection of panels (b) and (c) in Table 4 that similar patterns of conditional

probabilities hold for blacks and whites and because predicted and actual
conditional probabilities are fairly close for both groups.

A random black in 1969 is predicted to have an lipercent chance of
poverty. If he had been in poverty in 1968, his poverty probability in 1969

is increased to .65, while it would be only O4 if he had been out of
poverty in 1968. Having been in poverty in both 1967 and 1968 increases
the probability of poverty in 1969 to 74 percent, while being out of poverty

in the past two years reduces it to 2.5 percent.
These differences between conditional and unconditional probabilities
are the result of the combined effects of heterogeneity and serial correla-

tion. The effect of serial correlation itself can be isolated by comparing

P(69[67, 68) and P(69167, '68). Aside from slight trend effects, these
probabilities would be equal In the absence of serial correlation. With
serial correlation, poverty in 1969 is more likely for those who were in

poverty more recently. This is borne out by the fact that P(69 j'-67, 68) >

P(69 167, ''68) for blacks and whites for both predicted and actual probabil—
bilities, although for whites the difference in actual probabilities is
small.

The extent to which knowledge of an individual's poverty status in
year t continues to provide information about his probability of being in
poverty in a subsequent year r

t + k may be judged from the actual and

predicted k—step transition probabilities presented in Table 5 for t1967 and
t=l968,... ,1973. It is apparent from Table 5 that the risk of poverty to
those who were in poverty in 1967 remains considerably larger than the risk

to those who were out of poverty in 1967 as much as six years later. This
is true for predicted and actual probabilities among both whites and blacks
and is chiefly the result of heterogeneity.

Variation in

p

and

as t increases reflects two factors: (1) a

decrease in the unconditional poverty probability caused by an increase in
mean earnings relative to the poverty line and (2) a decrease in the informational value of serially correlated components in the conditioning year,

1967, as the distance from that year increases. Both factors tend to

decrease
for

p

as T increases,while the first tends to be offset by the second

Evidently, in the latter case, the two factors are of approxi-

mately equal strength since there is little trend in predicted values of

empirical counterpart is readily calculable by equation (3.2). For example,
the probability of being below one half the CPS median earnings ($3334) is
one—half for a person with (5 2.2 standard deviations below average ((5 = —1.04

and

=

.47) and is one—fourth for a person 1.4 standard deviations below

average ((5 =

—.67).

The average person ((5 = 0) has a .2 percent chance of

falling intO poverty compared to a 3 percent chance for an individual chosen
at random.

The probability of being in poverty in both 1970 and 1971 is similarly
illustrated and is also a monotonic function of (5

.

This probability is given

by equation (3.3). This is substantially less than the single—year probabilities
but greater than the product of the two single—year probabilities because of
serial correlation. For example, consider the person with (5 = —1.04 so that
=

.5.

If the years were independent, the joint probability of poverty

in both years would be .25. It is instead .31. As years become further apart,
the probability approaches .25. The joint probability of poverty in both 1970
and 1973 (it—TI = 3) is .26. The individual conditional probability of poverty
in 1971 given that this person was in poverty in 1970 is correspondingly .62

rather than .5. This is solely the result of serial correlation, since it
is the same person (same S). The conditional probability of poverty in 1973
given poverty in 1970 is .52.

The joint probability of being in poverty in 1970 but not in poverty in 1971
is not a monotonic function of (5.

The joint probability peaks at (5 = —1.04.

For (5 > —1.04, the probability of poverty is small in each year and conversely
for (5 < —1.04.

—29—

The distribution of single year poverty probabilities among individuals
is derived directly from the distribution of 6 and is stated in equations

(3.9) and (3.10). Here we illustrate these distributions for blacks and whites
using separate estimates of the components of variance for each group from
Table 1.

Consider the distribution function, panel B of Figure 2, and density
function, panel A, of poverty probabilities among blacks and whites for 1970.

Dispersion in poverty probabilities among individuals within each group

is the result of variation in the permanent component, 6. If

=

0,

individuals would have identical poverty probabilities, while if a2 =

all

0,

individuals would have either a unitary or zero poverty probability depending
on whether 6 is greater or less than bit.

The calculated distributions

presented in Figure 4 lie between these extremes because both transitory and
permanent variances are positive.
The differences between aggregate poverty probabilities and probabilities for a representative individual are illustrated by comparing the means

and medians of these distributions. The mean of the distribution of poverty
probabilities is equal to the proportion expected to be in poverty, which Is
.024 for whitesand .089 for blacks in 1970 (see Table 2). Given normality,
the median (i.e., representative) individual has a value of 6 =

the median of the poverty probability distribution is it =

Hence,

This implies that the rep-

SUIIMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we present a methodology in which average life cycle
earnings growth and the dynamics of the distribution of earnings — viewed
either as a continuous distribution or in terms of mobility across a set
of discrete earnings classes — can be analyzed within a common econometric

framework using longitudinal data. The basic ingredient of our approach
is an empirical (log) earnings function with an error structure that allows
for permanent differences among individuals due to unmeasured variables and
for first order serial correlation in the transitory components of a given

individual's time—series of earnings. We call this error structure the
"autocorrelated individual component model." Assuming normality of the
permanent and transitory components, the interteinporal distribution of log

earnings among individuals (holding measured variables constant) is multi—
variate normal with a correlation structure determined by the share of
permanent variance in total variance and the degree of serial correlation.
Earnings mobility is then analyzed by deriving the probability statements
implied by the earnings function for arbitrary time sequences of earnings
states (e.g. whether earnings are above or below an arbitrary poverty line)
for a given individual (i.e. holding the permanent component constant) or

for a group of individuals. The distribution of poverty probabilities across
observationally identical individuals is also derived.
The methodology is illustrated using seven years of data on male earnings

from the Michigan Income Dynamics Sample. The autocorrelated individual
component model is estimated separately for blacks and whites, as well as
for the total sample, using three successively more comprehensive sets of

—31—

explanatory variables. The simplest model (no explanatory variables except
time dummies) indicates that 73.1 percent of total variance in log earnings

represents permanent earnings differences. Of the remaining 26.9 percent
stochastic variation, 22.5 percentage points are due to purely stochastic
variation, and 4.4 to serial correlation.
The variance components and serLalcorrelation coefficients are of roughly

similar magnitude for blacks and whites. The permanent component for blacks
is about 44 percent larger than for whites, while their transitory component

is about the same. Some caution concerning these and other racial comparisons
is in order because of the relatively small number of blacks in our sample.
Explanatory variables in the more complex equations tend to leave the
size of the permanent and transitory variance components unchanged but reduce

the unmeasured permanent variance. For example, schooling, experience, and
race explaIn 33 percent of observed annual earnings variation, but they explain

44 percent of the permanent earnings variation. Schooling, experience, race
and the permanent component still explain 73 percent o'f total earnings variation.

Within racial groups, schooling and experience alone explain 51 percent of the
permanent component for blacks and 40 percent for whites.
We began this paper with several questions concerning the extent to which
poverty is a permanent or transient status and, more broadly, the degree to
which the distribution of earnings is characterized more by mobility or strat-

ification. Since the analysis in this paper is confined to males who had
earnings in a sequence of years, it cannot deal fully with such questions.
A more complete analysis of poverty would consider family income, variations
in family composition over time, unemployment and a variety of other issues.
However, within their limitations, our model's implications for the mobility

—32—

of blacks and whites into and out of poverty do suggest some tentative
answers to these questions.

The poor are different from the non—poor. Those in poverty in a given
year have permanently lower earnings than those not in poverty and are fifteen
to twenty—five times as likely to be in poverty as much as six years later.

Moreover, these differences are not solely the result of measured characteristics
such as race, schooling and experience ——

these variables explain only about

half of permanent earnings variation with the remainder due to unmeasured
factors. Finally, although about 2.5 percent of wh'ites and 9 percent of blacks
are predicted to have earnings below the 1970 poverty line, the representative
(i.e. median) person of either race had a negligible chance of falling into
poverty in that year.

While the poor are different in the sense just described, it would be
misleading to conclude that poverty is a permanent status. We find that of
those individuals in poverty in a given year, about 55 percent of whites and

35 percent of blacks will be out of poverty in the following year. Another
indication of mobility is that only 15 percent of whites and 35 percent of
blacks who fall into poverty at some time during the three year period from 1967—70
are expected tc be In poverty in all three years. It would also.be misleading to

conclude that our findings support the concept of a "culture of poverty" which
is qualitatively distinct from the social and economic environment in which

the majority of persons operate.22 Rather, our findings simply indicate that
the majority of cross—section earnings variation is due to permanent rather

than transitory factors. As a result, there is a considerable tendency for
individuals to retain their position in the earnings distribution over time whether
this position is in the lower, upper or middle portions of the distribution.

4mis methodology could be reversed. The reverse methodology has been
used in past and current work by James Heckman and Robert Willis on the analysis of panel data on discrete events, such as pregnancy (Heckman and Willis,

1975) and female labor force participation (Heckman,l977). This reverse methodology could be applied to poverty dynamics as follows. Assuming the error
components are normally distributed, sequential observations of poverty and

F— 2

nonpoverty could be used to estimate the parameters of the earnings function,.
the level of the poverty line and the covariance structure of unmeasured components (up to a factor of proportionality) using multivariate probit analysis.
While this approach has no appeal when earnings and the poverty line can be
observed directly, it provides a fruitful framework for the analysis of the
timing or sequence of discrete events such as female labor force participation
in which the underlying determinants of behavior such as market wages and the
shadow price of nonmarket time either cannot be observed or can be observed for
only part of the population (e.g. working women).

related mobility models.

clearly reduces to (1) the simple variance component model when

y = 0, and reduces to (2) a replicated (bldckwise) serial correlation model

when a6 = 0.
7Alternatively, this error structure may be interpreted as one assuming
an infinite history of random shocks.

8The SEO sample had been drawn such that all the SEO families chosen
by the Survey Research Center for the Income Dynamics Study ". . .had incomes

in 1966 equal to or below twice the federal poverty line at that time. The
selection formula was $2,000 + N($l,000) where N is the number of individuals

in the family," (Morgan, 1974, p. 2). An earlier version of this paper
contained estimates from a sample which included the SEO households. We are
grateful to Roger Gordon for calling our attention to the non—random nature
of the SEO sample.

9Alternative estimates of the earnings function coefficients, ,

for

the simple function were the same when estimated by OLS and by maximum likelihood jointly with the other parameters of the model.

F- 3

10For the purposes of estimation, the residual error structure is
put in the form of a system of linear structural equations, the parameters
of which are amenable to estimation by the LISREL III maximum likelihood

computer program of Joreskog and Sorbom (1976). The LISREL model is exposited
in Joreskog (forthcoming) and.its application to this structure is explained
in detail in Lillard and Weiss (1977).

set are presented in an appendix available from the authors.
121t is probably worth noting at this point that similar magnitudes of
these components have been found in other panel data for similar simple

earnings functions. For a longitudinal sample of American scientists in the
NSF Registry observed over the decade 1960—70, Lillard and Weiss [1976]
estimated that
y

= .67 and y = .70 for gross earnings and that

= .56 and

.63 for the residuals from a fairly detailed earnings function. The

results were stable over a wide range of scientific fields. In another
study based on individuals in the NBER—TH sample of W.W. II veterans on
whom information is available at intervals from 1943—1969, Lillard (1977)
found that 56 percent of earnings variation around an earnings function
including age, schooling and ability indices represented permanent differ-

ences. This study used a simple variance component model and arithmetic rather
than log earnings.

It is also interesting to recall that Friedman's (Friedman, 1967)
theory of the consumption function assumes that consumers perform an ex
ante decomposition of income variance into permanent and transitory com-

ponents. Estimates of p =

a2/c

(his notation is P) obtained by Friedman from

F—4

cross—section consumption—income data fall within the range of the (ex post

estimates of p that we obtain from panel data on earnings. For example, his
estimates of p for urban families is .82 in 1935—36 and .87 in 1941, while

corresponding estimates for farm families are .63 and .64

(Friedman,

Table 4, p. 67).

14Th1s expression was derived by James Heckman for the distribution of

women's labor force participation probabilities in a preliminary draft of
}Ieckinan and Willis [1977]. The published version of the paper contains the

derivation of an analogous expression for g(ir) for the general case in which
the functional forms of the distributions of the permanent and transitory
components are not specified.

17These features of the distribution of log earnings have also been
reported in other bodies of data in the U.S. and several European countries.
See Mincer (1974, p. 113) for discussion and citations to the literature.
While a variety of alternative functional forms for cross—section earnings
distributions have been proposed (see Singh and Maddala, 1976, for a recent
example), we are not aware of any which have a convenient multivariate form.
'8Another source of differences between predicted and actual aggregate
probabilities is the substantial year to year variation in the variance of log
earnings.
