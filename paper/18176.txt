Income inequality, tax base and sovereign spreads
Joshua Aizenman and Yothin Jinjarak
NBER Working Paper No. 18176
June 2012
JEL No. F36,F41,H20
ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the association between greater income inequality, de-facto fiscal space, and
sovereign spreads. Using data from 50 countries in 2007, 2009 and 2011, we find that higher income
inequality is associated with a lower tax base, lower de-facto fiscal space, and higher sovereign spreads.
The economic magnitude of these effects is large: at the margin, a one point of the Gini coefficient
of inequality (in a scale of 0-100), is associated in 2011 with a lower tax base of 2 percent of the GDP,
and with a higher sovereign spread of 45 basis points.

The growing public debt in OECD and developing countries put to the fore the need to
rebalance fiscal deficits. This can be done by either raising taxes, or cutting expenditure. The
recent experience of countries affected by the global crisis vividly illustrate the challenges with
raising taxes, suggesting the presence of structural factors accounting for resistance to tax
reforms. A possible obstacle may be polarized distribution of income. If all agents are identical,
equal burden sharing would be the norm. Greater income inequality may put a drag into efforts
to broaden the tax base. A possible mechanism explaining the resistance was modeled by
Bénabou (2000), showing conditions under which greater inequality would result in less
government spending on redistribution.
In this paper, we investigate the association between income inequalities and the tax base
across countries in the 2000s, and link it to the pricing of sovereign debt. We find strong
negative association between the two, and that higher inequality is associated with lower tax
base, lower de facto fiscal space, and with a higher sovereign spreads. 1 Our de facto fiscal space
follows Aizenman and Jinjarak (2011), defined as the public debt relative to the de facto tax
base, where the latter measures the realized tax collection, averaged across several years to
smooth for business cycle fluctuations. Thus, the de facto fiscal space is inversely related to the
tax-years it would take to repay the public debt. In practice, the average tax revenue provides a
good statistics on the de facto taxing capacity, being the outcome of the tax code and its effective
enforcement. While the public debt/GDP ratio may increase rapidly at times of peril [see Ireland
in the recent crisis, more than doubling its public debt/GDP in one year], the de facto taxing
capacity changes slowly at times of peril, as parties tend to be locked in a war of attrition,

Heller (2005) defined fiscal space “as room in a government’s budget that allows it to provide resources
for a desired purpose without jeopardising the sustainability of its financial position or the stability of the
economy.” Yet, measuring ‘fiscal space’ tightly remains a challenge. Ghosh et al. (2011) uses a
stochastic ability-to-pay model of sovereign default in which risk-neutral investors lend to a government
that displays “fiscal fatigue,” because its ability to increase primary balances cannot keep pace with the
rising debt. Using data for 23 advanced economies over 1970–2007, they find evidence of a fiscal
reaction function with these features, and use it to compute “fiscal space,” defined as the difference
between projected debt ratios and debt limits. This appealing approach provides operative measures of
fiscal space, yet its precision is limited by the inability to predict tightly future growth rates and real
interest rates.

attempting to minimize their adjustment burden [Alesina and Drazen (1991)]. Consequently, the
ratio of the outstanding public debt to the de facto tax base, or the tax-years needed to repay the
public debt, provide information about the relative fiscal tightness of countries. For a given
similar unanticipated adverse fiscal shock, a country with lower public debt/average tax revenue
may have more room to adjust by reallocating its priorities of using the relatively high tax base.

1. Estimation
We consider first a linear equation relating sovereign risk to de facto fiscal space:

SovRiskit = b0 + b1FiscalSpaceit-1 + uit + eit;
where SovRiskit is the market price of sovereign risk of country i at year t, FiscalSpaceit is the
fiscal space variable(s), and uit represents other factors that affect sovereign risk, such as trade
openness, growth, income level, inflation, and foreign reserves, and eit is the error term. As our
fiscal space variable, defined as public debt/[average tax revenue], is made of the public
debt/GDP in the numerator and the average tax revenue/GDP in the denominator, the interactions
between these two variables and other macroeconomic factors imply that the regressor,
FiscalSpaceit, is likely to be correlated with the error term. Including income inequality is our
gist of solution to this potential endogeneity of fiscal space as the main variable of interest. We
formally address the issue in the as follows.

Income Equality and Fiscal Space
It is plausible that an above-average inequality (i.e. a high Gini coefficient) could impair tax
collection and thus reduce the fiscal space at a given public debt level. This conjecture is in line
with Bénabou (2000), showing in a model of endogenous redistribution that more inequality may
result in less government spending on redistribution because the consensus for ex ante efficient
redistributive policies breaks down. This result was confirmed by the findings that more unequal
societies do spend less on redistribution [see de Mello and Tiongson (2006)]. Our goal is to test
3

directly the association of greater income inequality and the tax base, and to evaluate the ultimate
association of income inequality and sovereign risk.
As long as the income inequality does not have a direct effect on the sovereign risk, the
correlation between the Gini coefficient and uit would be small. Thus, the Gini coefficient is a
potential instrumental variable that is both relevant and exogenous. Figures 1.a and 1.b are
scatterplots of the data for 2007 and 2011, respectively, of the tax base - income inequality
relationship.2 A look at Figures 1.a and 1.b suggests that developed countries are clustered
mainly to the left, while emerging markets are clustered to the right. This suggests other
explanations, i.e. the association between the corruption level and tax base. Indeed, Figures 1.c
and 1.d support the negative relationship between tax base and the corruption index. Therefore,
we also include the Corruption index as an additional right hand variable:3
FiscalSpaceit = a0 + a1Giniit-1 + a2Gini2it-1 + a3Corruptionit-1 + eit.
Note that because sovereign risk, fiscal space, and income inequality are likely driven by
political economy considerations, we use the lagged Gini coefficient so that it affects the
sovereign risk only indirectly through the fiscal space variable(s). We base our econometric
analysis on the 50 countries that have comprehensive records of the key variables; Gini
coefficient, tax base, fiscal space, and market pricing of sovereign risk, up to year 2011. Using
data for the 50 countries in 2007 and in 2011, Table 1 reports the quadratic regression of fiscal
space variable and its components on the Gini coefficient and the Corruption level.

2

We use the World Bank’s “All The GINIS” 2010 data, compiled from 5 primary sources (LIS,
SEDLAC, WYD, ECA, and WIID), covering the desirable years for fifty countries. See Milanovic,
Lindert, and Williamson (2010), and Haughton and Khandker (2009). We refrained from using Atkinson
and the Theil’s indexes due to their limited coverage of countries and years.

3

We did not include GDP per capita as it is potentially endogenous with respect to the dependent
variable. Note that there could also be other explanations, such as an increasingly large informal
economy causing more inequality due to falling tax revenues and weakened social safety nets; and
increasing inequality causing more informal activity as social solidarity and trust decline (see Rosser et al.
2000).
4

Columns (i) and (ii) show that higher inequality is associated with lower tax base over the
sample period; and that the inequality effect has increased from 2007 to 2011. The quadratic
term, Ginii2, suggests that a negative association between inequality and tax collection flattens
out when inequality is high. The relationship between tax base and corruption is negative and
statistically significant. The R2 of these regressions are 55-65%, so the variation in inequality
and corruption explains a significant variance of tax collection across countries. On the other
hand, the associations between Gini coefficient and the public debt/GDP variable (columns (iii)
and (iv)), as well as the Gini and the public debt/[average tax revenue/GDP] (columns (v) and
(vi)), as well as the fiscal balance to GDP (columns vii and viii) and the fiscal balance to tax base
(columns ix and x) are insignificant. So the influence of inequality on fiscal space operates
through the tax base denominator. Based on the regression estimates of Table 1 columns (i) and
(ii), a one standard deviation increase of Gini (10.4 in 2007 and 2011) is associated with a lower
average tax base by -15.6 %GDP in 2007 [10.4*(-1.71) + 108.16*(0.02) = -15.6]; and by -21.4
%GDP in 2011. This back-of-the-envelope calculation is consistent with the patterns observed
in the plots of Figure 1.

2. Application to the Sovereign Risk Equation
We estimate the association between sovereign risk and fiscal space leaves with the two-stage
least square estimation, summarized as

(1)

SovRiskit = b0 + b1TaxBaseit-1 + Xit’b + ci + it

(2)

TaxBaseit = a0 + a1Giniit-1 + a2Gini2it-1 + a3Corruptionit-1 + Xit’a + ci + eit;

where TaxBaseit is a single endogenous regressor, a and b are two sets of unknown regression
coefficients, with Xit a set of exogenous variables, ci are the unobserved characteristics that vary
across countries but do not change over time, and Giniit and Gini2it are the two instruments in the
reduced form of TaxBaseit. We can now undertake a thorough evaluation of inequality effect on
both the fiscal space and the sovereign risk.
5

To deal with the presence of ci, we ask first: why do some countries have higher
sovereign risk than others? One reason might be variation in macroeconomic factors across
countries, including public debt/GDP, [exports+imports]/GDP, real GDP growth, consumer price
inflation, foreign reserves/external debt ratio, volatility of GDP (three-year standard deviation),
and time-specific effects -- we add these variables to Xit so they are not part of the error term.
Another reason is that there are historical factors influencing the sovereign risk. For example,
fragile states have higher sovereign risk than other states. This could possibly be related to
inequality and corruption, suggesting that an omitted factor in sovereign risk - whether the
country is inherently fragile - could be correlated with the Gini coefficient and the corruption
level.
To eliminate the influence of unobserved variables that vary across countries but do not
change over time, such as the state fragility and historical conditions, we make use of years
2007, 2009 and 2011 data.4 Table 2 provides results from three empirical specifications. All
regressions have the same regressors, and all coefficients are estimated using two-stage least
squares, with the functional form of the dependent variable, CDS prices, in log term, and various
plausible assumptions on the unobserved characteristics ci. The causal variable of interest,
TaxBase, is instrumented by Gini, Gini2, and corruption level.
Firstly, if E(Xit, ci) = 0 and cov(TaxBaseit, ci) = 0, then we could directly apply a pooled
two-stage least squares method to the panel data of 2007, 2009 and 2011 (3 data points) based on
the specification above. Column (i) applies the pooled two-stage least squares to the panel
sample, 50 countries * 3 years = 150 observations. The results of these pooled two-stage least
squares are consistent with the results of the time-specific estimation of columns (ii) to (iv);
respectively, years 2007, 2009, and 2011. For all specifications, the estimated effects of
4

We chose this particular time period due to the dramatic changes for several European countries that
may confound the estimation. There is evidence that the pricing behavior of the credit markets of the
Euro Area sovereign bonds was different before and after 2007. Arghyrou and Kontonikas (2010) find
that while prior to July 2007 the borrowing costs of the Euro Area countries were converging and
macroeconomic fundamentals did not play an important role, since August 2007, the markets began to
price in country-specific macro fundamentals.
6

TaxBase and other macroeconomic controls have the expected sign and are mostly statistically
significant at 1 percent level.
Column (v) applies the lagged-dependent two-stage least squares estimation to the data,
including the lagged CDS prices. This is like saying that there is a persistency in sovereign risk;
what makes CDS price in this period high is the CDS price in periods ago. The results suggest
that higher tax base and lower public debt are associated with lower CDS prices. To check the
validity of Gini coefficient as the instrument for TaxBase, Table 2 also reports the first-stage Fstatistics (equation (2)). For the regressions in column (v), the p-value of the first-stage statistics
is 0.000, so the Gini coefficients and corruption level are not weak instruments for TaxBase.
Because both regressions are overidentified, the Sargan test for overidentifying restriction has a
p-value of 0.0143 for column (v), suggesting that the null hypothesis that both the Gini, Gini2 ,
and corruption instruments are exogenous cannot be rejected at 1% significance level.
Alternatively, if E(Xit, ci)  0 and cov(TaxBaseit, ci)  0, we could handle the fixed
unobserved effects by constructing data on the changes in the variables between year 2007 and
year 2009, and between year 2009 and year 2011, and focusing on the medium-term period.
Specifically, the change in sovereign risk, SovRiski,2011 - SovRiski,2009, and
SovRiski,2009 - SovRiski,2007, are regressed against the change in tax base %GDP,
TaxBasei,2011 - TaxBasei,2009, TaxBasei,2009 - TaxBasei,2007 and the change in macroeconomic
factors, xi,2011 - xi,2009, and xi,2009 - xi,2007 where each xi,t is the variable in Xit. Three instruments
are used: the change in the inequality over the period, Ginii,2011 - Ginii,2009; the change in
quadratic term of inequality over 5 years, Gini2i,2010 - Gini2i,2005; and the change of corruption
level. The results of this before-and-after specification are in column (vi). The effect of the
TaxBase variable is now larger, positive, and insignificant. It is known that if the laggeddependent model (column (v)) is correct, but we use fixed effects as in column (vi), estimates of
TaxBase influence will tend to be too big.5
5

While the pooled 2sls in column (i) and the lagged-dependent 2sls in column (v) are not
straightforwardly comparable, a simple F test based on the same 150 observations suggests that the
estimation of (v) has significantly lower sum squared residuals (RSS) at the 5 percent level, consistent
with its having higher R2 (0.8 > 0.6). The first-differenced 2sls in column (vi) is the worst performing
7

We summarize the economic significance of our econometric findings in Figure 2. For
each variable, the corresponding bar in the figure is its coefficient estimate of column (iv),
multiplied by the sample standard deviation. Given that the sample standard deviation of CDS
prices is 1176.2 basis points in 2011, we find that our controls capture a significant variation in
the sovereign risk data. Our key factors of interest, the fiscal space variables (tax base and
public debt) – together account for more than 351.5 basis points of sovereign risk as measured by
the CDS prices, which is about a third of sovereign risk in 2011. This estimate indicates that
sovereign risk is responsive to the tax base, and hence the Gini coefficient, though this
association is estimated using changes over the period, so it is a medium-run relationship. Other
macroeconomic variables, including growth, volatility, and inflation are also economically large
and significant in the sovereign risk equation. Overall, the estimation suggests that increased
inequality, and thus decreased tax base and fiscal space, is associated with a significant
worsening impact on sovereign risk, at least in the medium run. Applying our estimates, with the
standard deviation of the tax base being 10.2 %GDP in 2011 (10.9% in 2007), a one standard
deviation increase of the Gini coefficient is associated with a rise of 469 (=[21.4/10.2]*223.6))
basis points of the sovereign spread in 2011, and 723 basis points in 2007 (= [15.6/10.9]*504.9).

3. Concluding remarks
This note identified the large negative association of income inequality with the tax base,
and with the de-facto fiscal space. The de-facto fiscal space plays a key role in accounting for
severing spreads [Aizenman, Hutchison and Jinjarak (2011)], and explains the patterns of fiscal
stimuli in the aftermath of the crisis [Aizenman and Jinjark (2011)]. The results suggest that
more polarized societies would find it harder to adjust to crises by raising taxes at times of peril,
as parties tend to be locked in a war of attrition, attempting to minimize their adjustment burden.
Thus, the de facto tax base is hard to change overnight, as it reflects a social contract. This
contract depends on the tax enforcement capacities of a country, which are anchored in the

estimation, due to the loss of variability in the data as a result of first differencing (can also be seen from
the low R2 in the first-stage estimation).

public’s perception of tax fairness and the gains from public sector expenditure, factors that are
hard to change at times of peril. This view is consistent with recent empirical literature finding
that tax compliance and the individual’s willingness to pay taxes are affected by perceptions
about the fairness of the tax structure. An individual taxpayer is influenced strongly by his
perception of the behavior of other taxpayers [see Alm and Torgler (2006), and the references
therein]. If taxpayers perceive that their preferences are adequately represented and they are
supplied with public goods, their identification with the state increases, and thus the willingness
to pay taxes rises [Frey and Torgler (2007)]. Thereby, greater income inequality limits the
ability to conduct a counter fiscal policy, and increases the downside risk of a given debt/GDP.
The discussion on the Euro crisis focused on the inequality between rich and poor
member states, and whether it has contributed to the crisis. Our analysis suggests that another
income inequality -- within countries -- could account for the resistance to conduct tax reforms.
Broadening the tax base and steps reducing income inequality will increase the likelihood of
greater fairness perception of the tax structure, lower polarization, higher adjustment capacity at
times of peril, and lower the sovereign risk associated with a given public debt/GDP.
Accomplishing these tasks is challenging, yet the history of Brazil during the last two decades
illustrates the feasibility of these reforms.6

The tax revenue in Brazil as a percent of the GDP rose from 25 percent to 37 percent between 1993 and
2005. Brazil’s GINI coefficient in 2001, 60, has decreased to 54 in 2009 [see Melo et al. (2010)]. The
record of the Euro Periphery has been mixed: the GINI coefficients of Greece was overall stable, 33 in
1999 and 32.9 in 2009, while its tax/GDP dropped from 35.4% in 1999 to 32.8% in 2009; for Portugal,
the GINI declined from 36 in 1999 to 33.7 in 2009, while its tax/GDP increased from 33.4% in 1999 to
34.4% in 2009; for Spain, the GINI went from 32 in 1999 to 33.9 in 2009, while its tax/GDP dropped
from 34.8% in 1999 to 31.6% in 2009; for Italy, the GINI went from 29 in 1999 to 31.2 in 2009, while its
tax/GDP increased from 42.4% in 1999 to 43.1% in 2009; for Ireland, the GINI went from 30 in 1999 to
33.2 in 2009, while its tax/GDP dropped from 32.8% in 1999 to 29.8% in 2009.

five years to account for business cycle fluctuations. The data are taken from the World
Bank's WDI, IMF Article IV Consultation documents, OECD, and Eurostat.

Public Debt/GDP data are based on the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department, Article IV Consultation
documents, and World Economic Outlook.

Sovereign CDS prices are 5-year tenor and based on the CDS pricing is based on London closing
values collected from a consortium of over thirty swap market participants. The data are
taken from the CMA Datavision. See Aizenman et al. (2011) for further discussion on
the CDS prices and related studies.

Trade/GDP, Inflation (consumer price, %), Real GDP Growth and Volatility (three-year standard

Table 2: Estimates of Sovereign Risk Equation Using Panel Data for 50 Countries.
This table reports two-stage least squares estimation (2sls): pooled 2sls for columns (i) to (iv); lagged dependent 2sls for (v); first-differenced 2sls for (vi).
The dependent variable is the log of CDS prices (in basis points, ln(SovRiskit)).
The endogenous regressor is TaxBase, with the lagged, lagged squared Gini coefficients, and lagged Corruption index as the instruments.
Standard errors are in parentheses (s.e.a for clustered by country heteroscedasticity robust; s.e.b for unadjusted standard error; s.e.c for GMM-bootstrap).
*** (**,*) denote statistical significance at 1 (5,10) level.
The first-stage statistics are from the regression of TaxBase on Gini, Gini2, Corruption index, and all other exogenous controls in the SovRisk equation.
