Pigouvian Taxation with Administrative Costs

ABSTRACT

This

paper examines how the optimal Pigouvian tax should be adjusted

to reflect administrative costs. Several cases are examined, depending
on

whether the administrative costs are fixed per firm

tion

taxed or are a func-

of the amount of tax collected, and on whether such costs are borne

by the government or by the taxed firm. In some cases, the presence of
administrative costs increases the optimal tax above the external cost,
while in other cases it leads to a decrease in the tax.

INTRODUCTION

Whenever a Pigouvian tax is used to control an externality-generating activity, "administrative" costs are incurred.
These costs might be borne by the government or by the taxed

party--assumed for concreteness to be a firm. They include
the time spent in filling out forms, the cost of having the
activity monitored, and the expense of resolving disputes

over tax liability. Some administrative costs, such as
those involved in filling out forms, depend only on the
number of firms, taxed and not on the tax revenue collected;

these will be referred to as "fixed" per firm. Other administrative costs, such as the expense of resolving disputes,
may depend on the amount of tax collected (e.g., legal

expenditures may rise with the size of the dispute); these
will be referred to as "variable" per firm.

This paper examines how the optimal Pigouvian tax
should be adjusted to reflect administrative costs when the
administrative costs are fixed or variable and when they are

borne by the government or the taxed firmJ As is well
known, in the absence of administrative costs, the tax

should equal the external cost. It is shown here that when
there are fixed administrative costs borne by the government,

the tax should exceed the external cost. This is because
raising the tax above the external cost reduces the number
of firms which engage in the activity and thereby saves

administrative costs. However, raising the tax causes those
firms which do participate in the activity to choose too

4

low a level of activity; the administrative cost of taxing
these firms is "sunk," so, with respect to them, the closer

the tax is to the external cost, the better. This limits
the extent to which the tax should be raised.

If, on the other hand, the fixed administrative costs
are borne by the taxed firms, the tax should equal the

external cost. In this case, it is not desirable to raise
the tax in order to reduce the number of firms which engage
in the activity because their bearing of the administrative
costs already accomplishes this (to an appropriate extent).

By setting the tax equal to the external cost, those firms
which do engage in the activity are induced to choose the
correct level of activity.

When the administrative costs are variable and borne by
the government, the optimal tax could be above or below the

external cost. For example, if the activity levels of those
firms which engage in the activity are not very responsive
to changes in the tax, then lowering the tax reduces tax

revenue and thereby saves administrative cost. This savings

may make it desirable to lower the tax. Similarly, if firms
are very responsive to the tax, it may be optimal to raise
the tax above the external cost.

Finally, if the variable administrative costs are borne

by the taxed firms, the optimal tax is below the external

cost. This result will be explained below.

THE MODEL
The model analyzed here has the following features.

Risk neutral firms derive benefits from engaging in an
activity which imposes a constant external harm per unit of

activity. Each firm is described by its schedule of benefits from participating in the activity at different levels.

The government imposes a tax per unit of activity. A firm's
problem is to choose a level of activity to maximize its

profits--its benefits less its tax payments and less any

administrative costs it bears. One possibility is that the
firm

chooses

not to participate in the activity at all. The

government's problem is to choose the tax rate to maximize
social welfare subject to the constraint that firms maximize

profits. Social welfare equals the benefits to those firms
which engage in the activity less the external harm they
impose and less administrative costs, whether borne by the

firms or the government. The following notation will be
used:

Thus, each firm's problem is:

(administrative

costs),

where the administrative costs are only a possibility and
may be of the fixed or variable kind.2 Let x(A,t) be the
activity level chosen by a A-type firm given a tax t; if

x(A,t) = 0, this means that the firm does not participate in

the activity at all. Note that a higher A corresponds to a
higher benefit schedule; thus, for any tax t, there will be
a critical value of the benefit parameter, denoted A(t),

such that firms with A below A(t) will choose not to engage
in the activity at all, and firms with A exceeding X(t) will
engage in the activity at a positive level.

Given the above, social welfare W may be written as

The first term represents the benefits to those firms which
engage in the activity and the second term represents the

external harm they impose. The government's problem is to
choose t to maximize

NO ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

For purposes of comparison, it will be useful to verify
that if there are no administrative costs, then setting the

tax equal to the external harm is optimal. To see this,
maximize social welfare (2) assuming that there are no

administrative costs. The first-order condition is

This can be simplified by noting that firms which are just
indifferent between participating and not choose an activity

Also, since each firm which

does participate chooses its level of activity so as to
maximize its benefits net of taxes, b(x,t) -

that b(x(X,t),X) =

As noted in the introduction, the administrative costs might
be borne by the government or by the firms themselves.

x(A(t),t) = 0 and b(x(X,t),A) =

LX (t)
The term

in

brackets is positive since X'(t) > 0 (the higher

the tax, the higher the minimum A required for firms to be
just willing to engage in the activity), since f(A(t)) > 0
(there are some firms which are just indifferent between
engaging in the activity and not), and since xt(A,t) < 0
(the higher the tax, the lower the level of activity chosen).
Thus, the optimal tax exceeds the external cost.
In order to understand this result consider two extreme

cases. First, suppose that all firms strictly preferred to
engage in the activity, or, equivalently, all firms had a A

exceeding X(t). Then f(X(t)) would be zero, so that, from
(6), the optimal tax would equal the external cost. This is

true for the following reason. The administrative costs
would be a sunk cost for society. Consequently, all that
would matter would be that firms choose the appropriate
activity level, and to achieve this the tax should equal the
external cost.

9

Second, suppose that if a firm

participates

in the

activity, it does so at a fixed level--say a unit level of
activity--and that the benefits to a A-type firm from parti-

cipation are A. Then, of course, there could not be any
effect of the tax on the activity level; the tax would
affect only the decision whether to engage in the activity.
Since by participating in the activity the firm would impose
on society the external cost plus the administrative costs,
the optimal tax would equal the sum of those two costs.6

These two cases illustrate respectively the effect of
the tax on the activity levels of firms and the effect of
the tax on the number of firms engaging in the activity, and

hence on the magnitude of administrative costs. As seen,
the first effect tends to make the optimal tax close to the
external cost and the second to raise it above the external

cost.7 However, it should be explained why the second
effect is always strong enough to raise the optimal tax

above the external cost. If the tax were equal to the
external cost, then the activity levels of firms which
choose to participate in the activity would be correct.

Thus, the effect on social welfare of a marginal change in

their activity levels would be zero. However, if the tax
were equal to the external cost, the effect on social welfare
of a marginal reduction in the number of firms that partici-

pate in the activity would be positive (this is the second

effect). Hence, a small increase in the tax above the
external cost would increase social welfare.

10

4.2 Borne by Firms
In this case, for a firm to be indifferent between

participating and not, it must be true that
b(x(X(t),t),X(t)) -

Thus, since b(x(X,t),A) =

t,

tx(X(t),t)

- a =

0.

(5) implies that t =

e.

As

noted in the introduction, because firms bear the administrative cost, they make the correct decision whether to
participate in the activity; and by setting the tax equal to
the external cost, those firms which do participate are
induced to choose the correct level of activity.

5.

VARIABLE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS PER FIRM
In this section, suppose that the administrative cost

per firm taxed depends on the amount of the tax. Specifically, let a(tx) be the administrative cost when the tax
collected is tx, and assume that a(O) =

0

and that a' > 0.

Therefore, the administrative cost term in the social welfare
function (2) is
1

fa(tx(A,t) )f(X)dA,
A (t)

so that the first-order condition determining the optimal
tax is

(7) W'(t) =

-A'(t)[b(x(X(t),t),X(t))

As before, x(A(t),t) = 0 and b(x(A,t)iX) =

t.

fore, (7) reduces to

(8)

t=e±A(t)

fx f(X)dA
X(t)t

Observe that f(x +

tx)a'f(X)dX

is the impact on administra-

tive costs of a marginal increase in the tax rate. This
consists of a positive direct effect due to the increase in
the tax given firms' existing levels of activity (J'xa'f(X)dA)

and a negative indirect effect due to reductions in firms'

levels of activity (ftxta'f(X)dA). Either effect may dominate.
Thus, the optimal tax could be above or below the external
cost.

To better understand this result, suppose the tax were

equal to the external cost. Then firms will be led to
consider the effect of their behavior on the external costs
(and, of course, on their own benefits), but not on adminis-

trative costs. Therefore, it will be beneficial to change
the tax to reduce the unaccounted for administrative costs.
This may require raising or lowering the tax for the reasons

noted in the previous paragraph. For a small change in the
tax, the resulting effect on social welfare due to changes
in firms' benefits and their external costs would be zero

since, with respect to these considerations, their activity
levels would have been correctly chosen.

12

5.2 Borne by Firms
Since x(X(t),t) = 0 and now b(x(A,t)) =

t a'(tx(X,t))t,
+

(7) reduces to

fxa'f(X)dA
(9)

fx f(A)dX
X(t)t
Note that fxa'f(X)dX is the effect on administrative costs
of a marginal increase in the tax rate given firms' existing

levels of activity. Since this effect is positive, the
optimal tax is unambiguously less than the external cost
(since x. <

0).

The explanation of this result is as follows. Suppose
the tax were equal to the external cost. As in the previous
case, firms will be led to consider the effect of their

behavior on the external cost and their own benefits. But
since they now bear the administrative costs, they will also

be led to consider the indirect effect of changes in their

activity levels on the administrative costs. However, firms
cannot consider the direct effect of changes in the tax on

administrative costs. By lowering the tax, administrative
costs are reduced at the existing levels of activity. The
resulting effects on social welfare due to changes in firms'
benefits, the external costs, and the administrative costs
would be zero since, with respect to these considerations,
their activity levels were correct.

NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
To illustrate the effect of administrative costs on the

optimal Pigouvian tax, some examples have been computed

using specific functional forms. In each case, the external
cost is $5.00 per unit of activity and the parameter defining
the benefit schedule, A, is assumed to be uniformly distrib-

uted between 0 and 1. The examples differ in terms of who
bears the administrative cost and in terms of the benefit
schedules.

Table 1 shows how the optimal tax rises when there are
fixed administrative costs borne by the government. For

administrative costs of $50 per firm, the optimal tax is
nearly twice the magnitude of the external cost.

Table 2 illustrates how the optimal tax is affected

when there are variable administrative costs. As demonstrated above, if these costs are borne by the government,
the optimal tax might be higher or lower than the external

cost. Both cases are shown in Table 2. For administrative
costs of $0.50 for every dollar collected in taxes, the
optimal tax rises 33% over the external cost in one case and

falls 78% in the other. Table 2 also shows how the
optimal tax falls when the variable administrative costs are

borne by the taxed firm. For administrative costs of $0.50
per dollar collected, the optimal tax falls 20% below the
external cost.

The only other analytical studies of administra-

tive costs and taxation have been in the context
of "optimal taxation," in which the problem is
typically to choose excise or income taxes to
raise a fixed amount of revenue with least dead-

weight burden (rather than, as here, to internalize
an externality) .

In

this context, Heller and

Shell (1974) characterize administrative costs in
a very general way and examine whether, given such
costs, it is desirable for production to be efficient.

Yitzhaki (1979) considers the tradeoff between
higher administrative costs and lower deadweight
burden as the number of taxed commodities increases.

Stern (forthcoming) compares optimal income taxation
to lump sum taxation when the taxing authority

makes errors in classifying individuals. Also,

17

Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980, PP. 359—360, 455)

have noted the desirability of incorporating
administrative costs in the analysis of taxation.
2.

It will be assumed that a solution to (1) exists.
Uniqueness is guaranteed (since

< 0)

when the

firm does not bear any administrative costs or,

when the firm does bear such costs, if they are
fixed; when the firm bears variable administrative
costs, uniqueness is assumed.
3.

It will be assumed that a unique interior solution
to this problem exists.

4.

Since these firms are just indifferent between
participating and not, their profits must be zero.

Now if it were strictly optimal for these firms to
participate at a positive level, then their profits
would have to be greater than they would be at a

zero level of activity. But their profits at a
zero level of activity are zero.
5.

This result can be derived in a simpler, more

direct way. The first-best solution--what the
government would order if it had complete control——is to have each firm choose a level of
activity x which maximizes b(x,X) - ex.
firm's problem is to maximize b(x,A) -

Since the

tx,

setting

t = e will induce the firm to choose the first-best

level of activity. This result was derived in the
text by maximizing the social welfare function

because later results require use of this method.

This result can easily be seen to follow from (2)

The fact that in (6) a higher a, f(X(t)), or
At(t) tends to raise t reflects the second effect.

8.

If a(O) were positive, then there would be some

fixed administrative costs per firm. The assumption that a(O) = 0 is made in order to isolate the
effect of variable administrative costs on the
optimal tax.
