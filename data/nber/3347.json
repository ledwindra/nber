Since the eruption of the debt crisis, many proposals for structural reforms in the developing countries have contemplated a trade liberalization process that would create a low and uniform tariff structure. In this paper I review the literature on the subject and construct a general equilibrium model to evaluate the consequences of alternative structural adjustment policies. Throughout the analysis it is assumed that labor markets and nontradables markets are subject to some distortions.\n\n",
