ABSTRACT
When Roosevelt abandoned the gold standard in April 1933, he converted what had been
effectively real government debt into nominal government debt to open the door to unbacked
fiscal expansion. We argue that he followed a state-contingent fiscal rule that ran nominal-debtfinanced primary deficits until the price level rose and economic activity recovered. Theory
suggests that government spending multipliers can be substantially larger when fiscal expansions
are unbacked than when they are tax-backed. VAR estimates find that primary deficits made
quantitatively important contributions to raising both the price level and real GNP from 1933
through 1937. The evidence does not support the conventional monetary explanation that gold
revaluation and gold inflows, which were permitted to raise the monetary base, drove the
recovery independently of fiscal actions.

1 Introduction
Franklin D. Roosevelt's monetary and scal policies helped to pull the United States out of
the Great Depression.

His rst step was monetary: America reduced the gold content of

the dollar, abandoned the promise to convert dollars to gold, and abrogated the gold clause
on all current, past, and future contracts.

This paper emphasizes his second, scal, step:

his administration expanded government spending, nanced that spending with nominal
bonds, and convinced people that the bonds would not be fully backed by future taxes
until the economy recovered. Because the monetary componentsdevaluing the dollar and
revoking convertibilitywere necessary for the scal step to work, this narrative is about

joint

monetary-scal actions.

When Roosevelt shucked o the gold standard's straightjacket, he was freed to exploit
the nominal nature of government debt.
denominated government liabilities are

If dollars are convertible to gold, even dollar-

real

obligations.

Credibility of the gold standard

rested on government standing ready to raise real taxes to acquire the requisite gold [Bordo
and Kydland (1995)]. By revoking convertibility, Roosevelt enhanced his policy options. He
could decide to continue the orthodox policy that new debt begets new taxes or to break from
the past and allow prices to revalue outstanding bonds. Early in his presidency, Roosevelt
chose the latter option.
Our thesis challenges the conventional wisdom that recovery had little to do with scal
policy. Scholars from Brown (1956) to Romer (1992) to Fishback (2010) maintain that scal
decits during Roosevelt's rst term were too small to close the gaping gap in output.

1

Those

economists base their conclusion on a narrowly construed scal transmission mechanism. The
government raises real spending, directly increasing real aggregate demand. Higher demand
propagates through higher real expenditures and income, eventually to raise output by a
multiple of the initial scal expansion. We call this mechanism Keynesian hydraulics, to
use Coddington's (1976) evocative label.

Under Keynesian

demand provides no additional economic

stimulus. Brown (1956) and the studies that followed explicitly exclude government borrowing from their analyses. Keynesian hydraulics implicitly assume that higher taxes extinguish
all wealth eects from higher nominal debt. That assumption eectively continues to treat
government debt as a real obligation, denying that the suspension of gold convertibility fundamentally altered the nature of government debt and the scal options available to policy
makers after 1933.
We broaden the perspective on scal transmission to include both Keynesian hydraulics
and a vehicle by which government debt dynamics aect economic activity. When nominal
government debt expands without raising expected taxes, private-sector wealth and aggregate demand increase via a conventional Pigou-Keynes-Patinkin eect. Roosevelt exercised
this optionunbacked scal expansionto implement a state-contingent policy: run debtnanced scal decits until the American economy recovers.
Our perspective complements and elaborates Eichengreen's (2000) conclusion that  . . . the
fundamental change in policy making in the 1930s was not the Keynesian revolution, but the
`nominal revolution'the abandonment of the gold standard for managed money. To reach
our perspective, broaden money to nominal government liabilities.

Nothing compels

policy makers to back expansions in either component of nominal liabilitiesbase money
or bondswith higher taxes. When they don't, debt-nanced scal expansion becomes a
potent policy tool.

1.1 The Policy Problem
nd

By the time Roosevelt was sworn in as the 32

president of the United States in March

1933, the economy had been declining for over three years.

Relative to the third quarter

of 1929, real GNP was 36 percent lower while current-dollar GNP was 57 percent smaller;
industrial production had fallen by half; unemployment had increased 22 percentage points;
and government debt had grown from 16 percent to over 40 percent of output. Although
his rst acts salvaged a banking system left reeling by three consecutive banking crises,
Roosevelt's focus never strayed far from those macroeconomic facts.
One fact gured prominently in his thinking: the precipitous decline in overall prices
bankrupted the farmers and homeowners who had incurred nominal debts at elevated price
levels.

Those citizens were also among Roosevelt's strongest supporters.

sulates the policy problem.

Figure 1 encap-

FDR felt that the key to economic recovery lay in returning

overall prices to their 1920s levels, to achieve  . . . the kind of a dollar which a generation
hence will have the same purchasing power and debt-paying power as the dollar we hope to
attain in the near future [Roosevelt (1933c)]. The problem was that in the 1920s the price
level was 60 percent above the long-run average to which it had to revert to maintain gold
convertibility at the parity that prevailed over the previous century.
Roosevelt's objective to return the price level permanently to that high level was inconsistent with remaining on the gold standard at the historical conversion rate.

FDR pur-

sued a triple-barreled approach to the problem. The executive branchwith Congressional
approvaltook control of monetary policy from a Federal Reserve that by all accounts had

been inept since the depression started.

The monetary component sharply reduced the

gold content of the dollar; it then evolved into complete abandonment of the gold standard
and abrogation of gold clauses on all public and private contracts.
The second barrel ran emergency scal decits nanced by new issuances of nominal
Treasury bonds.

Emergency spending served two purposes.

It provided much-needed re-

lief through a vast array of works programs and infrastructure projects. But the modier
emergency also communicated the temporary and state-contingent features of the scal
program.
Political strategy, which was crucial to establish the unprecedented scal program was
credible, composed the third barrel.

Roosevelt made recovery

the

policy priority; higher,

for example, than the last century's scal orthodoxy. The president found innovative ways
to persuade the people the stakes of recovery were unprecedentedly high. On the domestic
front, he feared agrarian revolution and amorphous resentment of economic institutions.

3

Internationally, FDR conjured images of European fascism. In advisor George F. Warren's
words, Roosevelt faced a choice between a rise in price or a rise in dictators.

4

The president

framed economic recovery as a war for the survival of democracy [Roosevelt (1936a)].

description of fact. Also see Wicker (1965) and Meltzer (2003) for similar assessments.

3 In October 1933, FDR told a group of nancial advisors that the gold-buying policy the Administration

pursued averted an agrarian revolution in this country [Blum (1959, p. 72)]. Leuchtenburg's (1963) aptlytitled chapter, Winter of Despair, documents that by the winter of 193233, economic despair transformed
into amorphous resentment of the economic institutions that people blamed for the depression.

inuence in context. See also Sumner (2001).

5 Authorities other than the president communicated the high stakes. As early as February 1933, Marriner

Eccles, in his capacity as a private banker, testied to the Senate Finance Committee that in the absence

3

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
and Rua (2017) present evidence that in the second quarter of 1933 ination expectations
picked up rapidly. That evidence suggests the third barrel succeeded to convince people that
Roosevelt would experiment with selling bonds that do not portend higher taxes, at least
temporarily.

1.2 What We Do
The paper places FDR's policy actions in the political and intellectual context of the times.
That context drives the narrative. Desperate times can engender creative measures. Despite
running for oce on his belief in sound nance, Roosevelt was at root a pragmatist, willing
to experiment with the economic levers at his disposaland even some levers that were not.
Several theoretical results underpin our narrative:
1. Under a classical gold standard with xed parity, monetary and scal policies are not
free to achieve any desired price level.
2. Unbacked scal expansion is infeasible under a classical gold standard.
3. Unbacked scal expansion permanently raises the price level.
4. Government spending and transfer impacts from unbacked scal expansion generally
exceed those from tax-backed scal expansion.
We bring both informal and formal empirical evidence to bear on the thesis. Surprise
ination signicantly reduced the value of government debt.

Over the seven years after

America left the gold standard, nominal debt rose 30 percent more than real debt. Negative
real returns on the government bond portfolio became more prevalent in that period. Government debt, which was 16.4 percent of GNP in the last quarter of 1929, rose to 42.3 percent
by the rst quarter of 1933. Although nominal debt doubled over the next seven years, it
averaged only 41.6 percent of GNP to belie the critics' hysteria about scal sustainability.
Nominal economic growth stabilized debt.
Identied VAR evidence nds that temporary scal expansions produce persistent increases in output, the price level, the monetary base, the market value of nominal government debt, and the monetary gold stock. Fiscal disturbances are also important sources of
uctuations in those variables and account for signicant fractions of the forecasts errors in
real GNP and the price level. Although the VAR recovers the patterns of correlation that
underlie conventional monetary explanations of the recovery, the VAR points to scal, rather
than monetary or gold, shocks as the genesis of those comovements.

2 Political and Intellectual Context
Roosevelt's decision to leave the gold standard and reate arose against a backdrop of growing political and intellectual consensus that higher retail and wholesale prices were critical
to recovery of wages, employment, investment, and consumption.

The banking crisis of

of federal government intervention into the economy, we can only expect to sink deeper in our dilemma
and distress, with possible revolution, with social disintegration, with the world in ruins, the network of its
nancial obligations in shreds, with the very basis of law and order shattered [Eccles (1933, p. 705)].

4

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
FebruaryMarch 1933 heightened expectations of a dollar devaluation as political pressure

6

mounted against maintaining gold convertibility at the existing parity.

To avoid capital

losses from the banking panic, foreign depositors in U.S. banks liquidated their dollar balances and converted them to gold, pushing gold reserves close to their statutory minimums,
particularly at the New York Fed.

Rebuilding dwindling gold reserves required the bank

to raise its discount rate in the middle of a banking panic. To avoid further strain on the
beleaguered nancial sector, Senator Elmer Thomas advocated issuing unbacked currency
to raise the price level to its 1920s level and Senator Tom Connally proposed reducing the
gold content of the dollar by one-third. Financial and political forces were aligning against
the gold standard.
Those realignments were echoed by a camp of economists who agitated for reation.
Irving Fisher's (1932; 1933b) debt-deation theory argued that when the private sector is
over-indebted, a falling price level triggers a sequence of eventslower asset prices, higher
real interest rates, contraction of bank deposits, decrease in prots, reduction in output, rising
unemployment, bank runs, and so onthat drives the economy into depression.

Viewing

nominal income through the equation of exchange, Fisher advocated government policies
designed to raise the money supply and velocity.
Fisher carried on extensive correspondence with the president and met with him several
times to discuss his economic proposals.

In an April 30, 1933 letter to Roosevelt, Fisher

(1933a) wrote, No one is happier than I over the prospect of the passage of the reation legislation, referring to the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which included the Thomas Amendment giving the president unprecedented powers to reate. George F. Warren, though, had
the ear of the president. George F. Warren was the rst person who ever advised a President
of the United States to raise the price of gold, begins Pearson, Meyers, and Gans (1957, p.
5598), a detailed description of Warren's role in Roosevelt's inner circle.
Keynes (1933) wrote an open letter to Roosevelt, published in the

New York Times,

calling for the U.S. government  . . . to create additional current incomes through the expenditures of borrowed or printed money. Although today Keynesian stimulus often is narrowly
construed as the real mechanisms of Keynesian hydraulics, Keynes's emphasis in this letter
is on governmental loan expenditure as the only sure means of obtaining quickly a rising
output at rising prices.

Keynes prescribed unbacked scal expansion:

nominal-liability-

nanced decits with no promise to raise future taxes to pay o the debt.
We do not claim that Roosevelt consciously engineered an unbacked scal expansion.
Nor do we believe that he had in mind the precise economic mechanisms that we identify
as critical to the recovery. There were false starts, such as the National Industrial Recovery
Act of 1933, which in addition to being ruled to contain unconstitutional features, likely
slowed recovery [Cole and Ohanian (2004)]. But his try anything macroeconomic approach
contained the essential ingredients for an unbacked scal expansion: suspension of the gold
standard, a commitment to run debt-nanced emergency decits until specied parts of the
state of the economy improved, and a policy decision not to sterilize gold inows, which
permitted the monetary base to grow without further increases in government indebtedness
for monetary reasons.
The paper does not try to use a formal model to reproduce recovery-period data, as

6 This exposition draws on Eichengreen (1992), particularly chapter 11.

5

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
Cole and Ohanian (2004) and Eggertsson (2008) do. In that tumultuous period, economic
agents confronted an entirely new and ever-evolving economic structure. Interpretations that
rely on modeling conventions like well-understood policy rules and rational expectations are
dicult to align with the historical facts. Instead, we use theory to frame the issues and to
interpret the history and the data.

3 Contacts with Literature
Our argument that the

joint

monetary-scal mix that underlies an unbacked scal expan-

sion spurred recovery in the 1930s contrasts with existing explanations, which frequently
attribute diminished roles to both monetary and scal policy. Existing studies argue that
the combination of dollar devaluation, the departure from the gold standard, regime change,
expansion of the monetary base, and rising ination expectations account for the recovery.
Our unbacked scal expansion interpretation broadly agrees with many of these arguments,
but links them to the monetary and scal policies of the 1930s.
Another distinction concerns the view that monetary policy made no substantive contribution to the recovery. Friedman and Schwartz (1963), for example, conclude the immediate
recovery owed nothing to monetary expansion [p. 433]. Wicker (1965) attributes Fed inaction to a leadership vacuum and the Fed's incomplete understanding of how monetary policy
aects the economy and the price level. Meltzer (2003, p. 273) atly declares that  . . . in
the middle and late thirties, just as in the early thirties, the Federal Reserve did next to
nothing to foster recovery.
We argue that by ensuring short-term interest rates did not rise with ination throughout
the 1930s, the Fed permitted unbacked scal expansion to reate the economy. Expansions
in nominal debt that do not portend higher future taxes raise household wealth at prevailing
prices and interest rates. Bond holders convert higher wealth into higher aggregate demand.
Some of the increased demand shows up in aggregate price levels, but if prices do not adjust
instantaneously, some demand raises real economic activity.

If interest rates are pegged,

monetary policy prevents the nominal debt expansion from raising debt service enough to
put debt on an explosive path. In this manner, Federal Reserve policy performed a critical
role: it permitted higher price levels to bring the real market value of debt in line with the

7

expected present value of the primary surpluses that back debt.

Monetary and scal policy

are equal partners in successful unbacked scal expansion.
The economic consequences of the unbacked scal expansion that began in 1933 rationalize why concerns that expanding federal debt would threaten the U.S. government's
creditworthiness were not realized.

Studenski and Krooss (1952, p.428) summarize a key

feature of unbacked scal expansion:
In its early years, the New Deal administration itself believed that the public
credit could not sustain continuous budgetary decits and increases in the public
debt. But in practice this also proved incorrect. The public credit did not collapse
under the burden of increased public debt. On the contrary, government credit
grew stronger, interest rates on new government borrowing declined steadily, and
the Treasury found it increasingly easy to nance its operations.

7 Leeper (1991), Sims (1994), Cochrane (1999), and Woodford (2001) describe this mechanism. Bianchi
and Melosi (2017, 2018) formally model unbacked scal expansion.

6

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
Unbacked expansions raise prices and real GNP to ensure that higher nominal debt does not
transform into a higher debt-output ratio.
The initial impetus for recovery came from dollar devaluation and departure from the
gold standard, which signaled a change in policy regime that raised ination expectations,
according to the consensus view. We agree that these elements all contributed to the recovery,
particularly in commodity prices, but argue they cannot account for the rapid pick up in
the price level and output in isolation.

Temin and Wigmore (1990) oer evidence that

dollar devaluation in 1933 signaled that Roosevelt had abandoned the deation associated
with adherence to the gold standard and that the lower dollar directly increased aggregate
demand and indirectly raised prices and production throughout the economy.

Hausman

(2013) supports Temin and Wigmore's hypothesis by showing that increased agricultural
incomes bolstered auto sales in rural areas.

Hausman, Rhode, and Wieland (2019) oer

evidence that the redistribution of income to constrained farmers in the spring of 1933
links devaluation to higher agricultural incomes and aggregate demand.

Their framework

abstracts away from macro policies to focus instead on the role of microeconomic channels
through which the nominal eects of monetary and scal policies operated. Romer (1992),
however, makes a forceful case that the dollar depreciation after April 1933 cannot account
for the sustained increases in subsequent price levels. We agree with Romer and point out
as do Jalil and Rua (2017)that both Britain and France experienced similar depreciations
in their currencies after leaving gold, yet prices and output did not rise as they did in the
United States.
Our work complements Jalil and Rua's narrative evidence on the role of rising ination expectations in the recovery of 1933. We ground those expectations in the prevailing
monetary-scal policy mix.
Our narrative shares some elements with Eggertsson (2008), but the economic mechanisms dier in important ways. Eggertsson emphasizes a regime change in policy dogmas
from Hoover to Roosevelt and relies on new Keynesian mechanisms for escaping from the
lower bound on the nominal interest rate, with expectations anchored on an eventual return to the conventional active monetary/passive scal policy mix.

8

Eggertsson's story rests

on the coordinated action of monetary and scal policy to maximize household utility. In
the presence of distorting taxes, higher decits provide an incentive for the Fed to keep
interest rates low for an extended period of time, to manage the value of outstanding debt.
Monetary policy mitigates tax distortions by committing to generate ination when the Fed
has the freedom to do sothat is, once the zero lower bound ceases to bind. In this way,
the time-consistent policy generates the same stimulatory mechanisms that Eggertsson and
Woodford's (2003) optimal commitment policy delivers.
This interpretation faces two diculties. First, it requires substantial policy coordination. Eccles (1951) describes a highly decentralized Federal Reserve, both in its operations
and in its objectives, an account that Wicker (1966), Wheelock (1991), and Meltzer (2003)
conrm. Federal Reserve ocials frequently voiced concerns about the prospect of ination,

8 Leeper (1991) denes an active policy authority as free to pursue its objective, while a passive authority
is constrained by the behavior of the active authority and optimizing private behavior.

In a model like

Eggertsson's, a determinate bounded rational expectations model requires either an active monetary policy
with a passive scal policy or vice versa.

7

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
even during the deationary years in the early 1930s [Meltzer (2003, p.

9

280)].

Second,

Eggertsson's mechanism leans heavily on rational expectations at a time when the entire
monetary system had no precedent. It is dicult to square that history with Eggertsson's
sophisticated and single-mindedly inationary Fed behavior. Unbacked scal expansion does
not require rational expectations, as Eusepi and Preston (2012) and Sims (2016a) show. In
this important sense, our mechanism is far less demanding than is Eggertsson's.
History was not nearly as linear as our unbacked scal expansion interpretation makes it
seem. Disparate viewpoints about the depression battled for the soul of FDR, in Stein's
(1996, ch. 6) memorable phrase. A 1932 Memorandum written by three young Harvard
economists nicely distills those disparate views. The document denounces the failure on the
part of the government to adopt other than palliative measures to combat the depression
[Currie, White, and Ellsworth (2002, p.

534)].

Viewpoints Roosevelt contended with in-

cluded: (1) economists who believe the depression cannot be stopped and any eorts to do
so interfere with the natural functions of the economy; (2) those who believe the economy
is so poorly understood that government eorts are likely to make matters worse; (3) some
who adopt the view that depressions are cleansing and purge ineciencies; (4) a group, like
the Memorandum's authors, who believe that recovery can and should be hastened thru
[sic] adoption of proper measures.

10

Roosevelt clearly sided with the fourth group, at least in the early years of the recovery.

4 Why Unbacked Fiscal Expansion?
Contemporary supporters and critics understood that Roosevelt's price-level objective entailed a permanent increase in prices to 60 percent above their long-run average.

But a

permanent revaluation of the dollar price of gold required leaving the gold standard.

Result 1. Under the gold standard with a xed paritythe classical gold standardmonetary
and scal policies cannot achieve any desired price level.

11

Straightforward economic logic underlies this result.

Private holdings of gold, which

standard asset-pricing reasoning determines, establish the goods value of goldthe aggregate
price level. The Euler equation for private gold demand implies that

9 Some academic economists backed those voices. Eleanor Lansing Dulles (1933, p. V) at the University
of Pennsylvania drew on the French experience in the 1920s to write in November 1933 that the United
States faced serious dangers from ination: Ination takes many forms, Government debt is the most
insidious. . . . Oliver Sprague, a Harvard professor and advisor to Roosevelt's rst treasury secretary William
Woodin, opposed leaving gold, warning that America was in great danger of a great ination such as German
had [Pearson, Meyers, and Gans (1957, p. 5616)].

10 Two authors went on to play critical roles in policy: Currie at the Federal Reserve Board, Treasury,

and the White House; White at the Treasury where, together with Keynes, he created the Bretton Woods
system.

When the dollar price of gold is xed at

rate of substitution between gold and consumption uniquely determines the equilibrium price
level.
Monetary policy must passively adjust to accommodate the price level consistent with the
pegged price of gold. Fiscal policy must passively adjust primary surpluses to provide gold
backing for outstanding government debt at that price level. This establishes that leaving
the gold standard and abandoning convertibility were necessary to achieve FDR's price-level
objective.

Denition 2.

Unbacked scal expansion increases government expenditures on purchases or
transfers, issues nominal bonds to cover the decit, and persuades people that surpluses will
not rise to nance the bonds.
Simple theory makes this denition precise and illustrates the price-level consequences
of unbacked scal expansion.

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
Unbacked scal expansion requires active scal behavior; the government does not use
future surpluses to stabilize debt.

Condition (3) uniquely determines the price level as a

function of the expected present value of primary surpluses including seigniorage revenues
the right sideand outstanding nominal government liabilities. Asset-pricing condition (1)

determines the price level as a function of the gold price, P̄ , and prevailing conditions in
the gold market. These two price levels will generally be dierent.

When the price level consistent with P̄ is too low to satisfy (3), the real value of debt
exceeds its real backing. Households will over-accumulate government bonds to violate their
optimality conditions. When the price level under the gold standard is too high, households
will refuse to buy bonds, and the government will violate its budget constraint. By either
outcome, no equilibrium exists.

Unbacked scal expansion permanently raises the price level.

this increase is permanent, examine how nominal government liabilities at time 0 change.

M0 /P0 = L(ī, ȳ), and real debt, B0 /P0 = τ̄ /(1 − β), remain
unchanged because they do not depend on τ0 . With the change in price level, ∆P0 , given by
the equilibrium condition, both M0 and B0 expand in proportion to ∆P0 . In the absence of
Both real money balances,

any further disturbances, nominal liabilities remain at those permanently higher levels, as
does the price level.

12

These theoretical points establish that an appropriately scaled unbacked scal expansion
could, in principle, achieve FDR's price-level objective and that ending convertibility of
dollars for gold was a necessary rst step.

But why did Roosevelt opt for a scal, rather

than a monetary, solution?

4.1 Monetary Policy
In the wake of the Federal Reserve's inactivity in the worst years of the depression, Congress
feared that any recovery would be stymied by continued Fed inaction [Meltzer (2003, p.
459)]. The Thomas Amendment of May 1933 granted the Executive unprecedented monetary
powers, which included xing the gold value of the dollar, issuing greenbacks, and ordering
the Fed to buy Treasury securities. This was a rst step to ensure the Fed would not act to
thwart the stimulative impacts of scal expansion.
Enter Klüh and Stella (2018) who argue that the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 undermined
the Fed's ability to reverse the stimulus through open-market operations.
to the Treasury legal title to all monetary gold.

Treasury bought gold by issuing gold

certicates, which could be held only by the Fed and were redeemable
Treasury's discretion.

The Act gave

in dollars

only at the

Treasury gold purchases raised the Fed's monetary liabilitiesnew

Treasury deposits at the Fedwithout commensurate increases in liquid assets. By the end
of 1936, the Fed's total monetary liabilities were $10.89 billion, of which only $2.43 billion

13

were liquid: over 80 percent of the Fed's assets were irredeemable gold certicates.

12 Because the expansion in

M0

depends on

L(ī, ȳ),

rather than directly on the size of the decit, this is

not conventional money nancing of decits, as in Sargent and Wallace (1981). Instead, the money supply
expands passively to ensure the money market continues to clear at the pegged nominal interest rate

ī.

13 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1937). Total monetary liabilities are Federal Reserve

10

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
Klüh and Stella (2018, p. 4) observe that Fed ocials understood they could not win a
war of attrition with the Treasury. The Treasury could undertake gold purchases to expand
reserves without limit, secure in the knowledge that it was infeasible for the Fed to sterilize
them.
Operational factors combined with institutional features of the Federal Reserve in the
early 1930s to reduce the Fed to impotence, according to Eccles (1951). At the time, there
was no single Federal Reserve policy; there was a policy for each regional Reserve Bank
and the Board of Governors. Eccles emphasizes that Reserve Banks were beholden to their
directors, who acted in the private interests of bankers. Before accepting the nomination to
chair the Federal Reserve Board, Eccles insisted on institutional reforms that consolidated
decision-making power in Washington, D.C. The Banking Act of 1935, among other things,
changed the decision-making process at the Fed, which Eccles describes:
 . . . before a uniform decision could be reached. . . there had to be a complete
meeting of the minds between the governors of the 12 Reserve banks and the
108 directors of those banks, plus the FRB in Washington. A more eective way
of diusing responsibility and encouraging inertia and indecision could not very
well have been devised. Eccles (1951, p. 170)
While the Fed could not sterilize the Treasury's gold purchases, monetary policy also
did little to advance Roosevelt's economic agenda.

After only minor actions in 1933, the

Fed conducted no open-market operations after November 1933.

This inactivity occurred

against a backdrop of current and former Fed ocials publicly expressing concerns about
run-away ination. After leaving his position as Fed Chairman on May 10, 1933, Eugene
Meyer wrote that  . . . the mere fact that the Administration has assumed responsibility for
dening our monetary policies and xing our price goal, indicates a subordinate role for the
Federal Reserve System [Meyer (1934)]. Adolph Miller, one of the original governors of the
Federal Reserve System, who served until 1936, was vociferous in calling for a return to gold,
fearing the discretion that underlies a managed currency, which he called human nature
money [Miller (1936, p. 4)].
At a practical level, it was not clear that monetary stimulus would be eective. There
was no assurance, particularly on the heels of sequential banking crises, that higher reserves
would lead to higher bank deposits. Nor was it certain that higher deposits, if they were

14

forthcoming, would ultimately increase bank loans to nance new investment.

As it happened, banks, worried about the Federal Reserve's failure to fulll its lenderof-last-resort function, behaved conservatively and expanded holdings of government bonds,
rather than loans to the private sector. From March 1933 to June 1940, annual growth rates
of narrow money far outstripped those of broad money: reserves (23.1 percent), base (12.8
percent), M1 (7.7 percent), and M2 (5.2 percent). This was a very dierent pattern from
the 1920s when M2 averaged 3.2 percent annual growth and reserves averaged 2.8 percent.
and Federal Reserve Bank notes outstanding plus bank reserves; total liquid assets are gold reserves plus
U.S. Treasuries. Gold certicates remain on the Fed's balance sheet today.

14 Although Bordo and Sinha (2018) argue that the $1 billion open-market operation in 1932 was stimula-

tive.

11

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
4.2 Fiscal Policy
Unbacked scal expansion served several of FDR's objectives. Given his strong support in
Congress, particularly from inationists like Senators Thomas and Connally, scal policy
was largely under the president's direct control. Federal Reserve actions, to FDR's frustration, were beyond his control.
Fiscal policy also served political objectives. By providing immediate relief to the unemployed, farmers, and the forgotten man, federal expenditures tamped down domestic
unrest.

Direct relief was a highly visible indicator that the federal government had the

common man's interests at heart, helping to re-establish condence in policy institutions.
Finally, economists and politicians alike understood that deation had redistributed wealth
from debtors to creditors.

Reation, and the scal actions underlying it, were deliberate

eorts to reverse that redistribution.

15

Roosevelt's attitudes toward redistribution shone

through in a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Woodin: I wish our banking and economist
friends would realize the seriousness of the situation from the point of view of the debtor
classesi.e., 90 percent of the human beings in this countryand think less from the point
of view of the 10 percent who constitute creditor classes [Roosevelt (1933a)].
Roosevelt walked a ne line on scal policy, seeming to maintain contradictory positions.
During the 1932 campaign for president, he harshly criticized Hoover's decits and took a
Pittsburgh pledge to balance the budget by reducing expenditures [Roosevelt (1932a)]. Just
six months earlier he delivered his famous speech about the forgotten man at the bottom of
the economic pyramid [Roosevelt (1932b)]. That speech characterized the depression as a
more grave emergency than World War I and called on government to restore the purchasing
power of farmers and rural communities and assistance to homeowners and farmers facing
foreclosure.
Six days after taking oce, Roosevelt sent to Congress a proposal to cut federal spending
by an amount equal to nearly 14 percent of total expenditures. Cuts eliminated government
agencies, reduced federal worker pay, and, most critically in light of the politics of the time,
shrank veterans' benets by half. When the Economy Act of 1933 was nally signed into law,
the spending cuts amounted to a little under seven percent of expenditures, but Roosevelt
could point to the legislation to help establish his bona des as a sound nance man.
Just 20 days into his administration, Roosevelt created fresh scal nomenclature in a
press conference.

Asked when it might be possible to balance the budget, the president

replied,  . . . it depends entirely on how you dene the term, `balance the budget ' [Roosevelt
(1933b, p.

13)].

His reply spawned the distinction between ordinary and emergency

expenditures, which became institutionalized in Treasury Reports.

16

15 Fisher (1934, ch. VI) thoughtfully discusses how to arrive at a just price level that balances the losses
of borrowers and creditors. Eccles (1933) pointed to the redistribution of wealth as a source of the prolonged
depression: During the period of the depression the creditor sections have acted on our system like a great
suction pump, drawing a large portion of the available income and deposits in payment of interest, debts,
insurance and dividends. . . .

16 The reply continued: What we are trying to do is to have the expenditures of the Government reduced,

or, in other words, to have the normal regular Government operations balanced and not only balanced, but
to have some left over to start paying the debt. On the other hand, is it fair to put into that part of the
budget expenditures that relate to keeping human beings from starving in this emergency?

I should say

probably not. . . You cannot let people starve, but this starvation crisis is not an annually recurring charge.

12

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
FDR was more comfortable with decits by 1936. In the face of precipitous declines in tax
receipts, he argued that To balance our budget in 1933 or 1934 or 1935 would have been a
crime against the American people [Roosevelt (1936b)]. And in response to budget director
Lewis W. Douglas's argument that the only way to project a balanced budget in 1936 was
to cut spending, Roosevelt replied, No, I do not want to taper o [spending programs] until
the emergency is passed [Rosen (2005, p. 85)]. On the other hand, he supported tax hikes
in 1935 and 1937.
Why did FDR wae so on scal policy?

It is possible, as Stein (1996) suggests, that

Roosevelt was tentative and uncertain about scal stimulus. But the waing may have been
deliberate. His distinction between ordinary and emergency government expenditures was
central to communicating that unbacked scal expansion was state-contingent. Linking the
state-contingent emergency expenditures tightly to the economic emergencythrough both
their timing and their labelsRoosevelt drove home their temporary nature. At the same
time, by demonstrating scally responsible ordinary spending, he could reassure his critics,
particularly bankers, that once the crisis passes, he would balance the budget. Roosevelt's
January 1936 budgetary address made this point explicit when he said,  . . . it is the decit
of today which is making possible the surplus of tomorrow [Roosevelt (1936c)].

5 Empirical Facts and Theoretical Interpretations
This section presents a variety of facts about the state of the U.S. economy throughout the
1920s and 1930s. It oers some evidence that corroborates the interpretation that unbacked
scal expansion spurred recovery. In the gures that follow, we contrast the performance of
economic variables during the gold standard (January 1920 to March 1933) to their behavior during the unbacked scal expansion (April 1933 to June 1940). Data are quarterly.
Vertical bars in the gures at April 1933 mark America's departure from the gold standard.
The section also lays out a new Keynesian model to contrast scal multipliers under
Keynesian hydraulics and unbacked scal expansion. We then use the theory to interpret
time series on government debt and on the returns to debt.

5.1 Macroeconomic Indicators
The price level, however measured, decreased by roughly 30 percent from the stock market
crash in October 1929 to its trough in April 1933 when the United States abandoned the
gold standard (right panel gure 2). Although consumer and wholesale prices and the GNP
deator rose through most of the 1930s, they never regained the 1920s levels that various
policymakers desired.
Like prices, output also plunged after the stock market crash and rebounded with the
abandonment of the gold standard. The left panel of gure 2 shows that real GNP fell by
roughly 25 percent from peak to trough, as measured on an annual basis.

GNP hits its

trough in the rst quarter of 1933. Industrial production dropped 45 percent from peak to
trough and, like consumer and wholesale prices, began a sustained recovery in April 1933.
Unlike prices, GDP and industrial production eventually surpassed their pre-recession peaks.
I think that is the easiest way of illustrating what we are trying to do in regard to balancing the budget. I
think we will balance the budget as far as the ordinary running expenses of the Government go [Roosevelt
(1933b, pp. 1314)].

The left panel of gure 3 shows the dollar-sterling and dollar-franc exchange rates. The
rst vertical line marks when the United Kingdom left gold in September 1931, which triggered a very large dollar appreciation that was reversed in April 1933. Note that sterling's
depreciation against the dollar is roughly comparable to its subsequent appreciation.
Figure 3's right panel plots the level of the GNP deator along with two interest rates
the commercial paper rate for New York and the New York Fed's discount rate. Although
during the gold standard period interest rates generally followed the decline in the price level,
there are also several distinct deviations when rates rose sharply despite a at or declining
price level. For example, in October 1931, concerns about gold outows induced most Federal
Reserve banks to raise their discount rates after Britain left the gold standard, even though
prices were in free fall.

The Federal Reserve banks aimed to mitigate the gold outows

that dollar appreciation vis-à-vis the pound triggered. Meltzer (2003, p. 280) claims that
Federal Reserve policy decisions were mostly consistent with the Rieer-Burgess and real

17

bills doctrines.

But these interest-rate hikes were clear attempts by the Federal Reserve to

follow the gold standard's rules of the game [p. 273].
After the abandonment of the gold standard in April 1933, the Federal Reserve pegged
the discount rate, changing it infrequently. Meltzer (2003, p. 413) notes that the Federal
Reserve made few changes to its market portfolio and discount rates from 1933 to 1941. If
anything, rates moved against the price level: the Fed was not adjusting policy to combat
higher prices; instead, it was permitting price-level rises to devalue outstanding government
bonds.

17 Meltzer (2003, p. 282) elaborates that under the Rieer-Burgess framework, policymakers focused on
borrowed reserves and short-term market interest rates as key signals of bank demand.

stem from the revaluation of gold to $35 an ounce.

Steady increase in the two monetary

measures during the unbacked scal expansion period reects the Roosevelt Administration's
decision not to sterilize gold inows. That decision was reversed in 1937, reducing the growth
rate of the base [Irwin (2012)] (see appendix C for more details on sterilization).
For a couple of years before the gold revaluation, the cover ratio was precariously low,
imposing a severe constraint on the level of the monetary base. Eichengreen (1992) recounts
events during February and March 1933 when the New York Fed was at its statutory 40
percent minimum gold cover ratio, which prevented it from rediscounting bills.

Initially,

other reserve banks discounted bills on New York's behalf. By March 3 the Chicago Fed,
which held the bulk of the System's excess gold, refused to provide further assistance to New
York for fear that it would be unable to help banks in the Chicago district. These tensions,
which stemmed from the absence of a coherent

national

monetary policy, exacerbated the

already tenuous state of commercial banks and raised doubts about the credibility of the
System's commitment to gold parity.
Ocial revaluation of gold in January 1934, by almost 60 percent, increased the cover
ratio sharply and it remained close to 0.90 for the remainder of the decade. Gold no longer
constrained policy behavior as it had before April 1933, a point that is central to the theory
of unbacked scal expansion.
Table 1 reports the highs and lows of GNP and its components. By 1937, constant-dollar
GNP exceeded its 1929 high, but investment remained below its high. In current dollars,
GNP and its components did not regain their 1929 peaks. Monetary aggregates fell in the
early 1930s as nancial unrest lead to contractions in deposits and cash hoarding by the
public. Total deposits in all banks fell 30 percent between 1929 and the low point in 1932
33. Deposits bounced back to their pre-depression levels by 1937. Loans, which declined over

5.2 Policy Behavior
Many authors have noted that adherence to the gold standard imposed severe constraints
on monetary and scal policies by focusing policy authorities on international considerations
at the expense of domestic conditions [see Wicker (1966) for discussions of monetary policy
constraints]. Eichengreen (2000) argues that the gold standard prevented governments from
reating: So long as the gold standard remained in place, the commitment to defend the
central bank's gold reserves and stabilise the gold parity was an insurmountable obstacle to
the adoption of expansionary policies.

Apropos of scal policy under the gold standard,

when taxes must back government debt, is Eichengreen's statement: Decit spending could
not be used. . . if decit spending could not be nanced.
Figure 5 illustrates precisely the constraint on monetary policy that Eichengreen has
in mind.

Dashed lines are interest rates and the solid line is the growth rate of the gold

stock. A shrinking gold stock usually induced Federal Reserve banks to raise interest rates
to attract gold from abroad, which arrived with a lag.

And when Federal Reserve banks

lowered interest rates, gold would ow out of the United States. But in the 1920s, as gure
3 shows, these interest-rate movements occurred in the face of a steadily falling price level.
The Fed's actions aimed to stabilize exchange rates at the expense of domestic prices.

5.2.1 Emergency Spending

Our interpretation of the 1930s recovery relies on a joint

monetary-scal policy mix that was possible only after abandoning the gold standard. The
top panel of gure 6 plots three measures of the federal budget surplus: gross, primary, and

17

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
ordinary, dened as total receipts less what are labeled ordinary expenditures. All three
measures deteriorated sharply as economic activity contracted in the early 1930s.

Falling

surpluses stemmed from declining revenues due to lower corporate and income tax receipts
and rising expenditures due to increased public works spending. Although Roosevelt touted
the evils of decits and was more outspoken than President Herbert Hoover in his promise to
cut expenditures, until the second half of the decade he did little to convert primary decits

18

to primary surpluses.

Decits remained sizeable until 1936, despite growing receipts from 1934 onward [table
2]. To reassure the public that scal nances were sound, Roosevelt's Treasury drew a clear
line between ordinary and emergency government expenditures.

19

With the exception of

1936, when large veterans' bonuses were paid out, Roosevelt could claim that he balanced
the ordinary budget [left panel of gure 6].

From 1934 to 1937, emergency expenditures ranged from one-third to over one-half of
total federal expenditures [table 2].

Emergency expenditures fall into three categories

public works, relief, and other spending. Table 3 shows that public works expenditures
public highways, Hoover dam, reclamation projects, improvements of rivers and harbors,
ood control, and the Tennessee Valley Authoritydoubled under Roosevelt. But Hoover
also doubled public expenditures from historical averages. Roosevelt's public works program
included $3.3 billion in funds allocated to the Public Works Administration (PWA) which
also made loans for private construction in addition to federal projects.
Roosevelt's relief spending, a mixture of direct relief and works projects, was the largest
emergency expenditure category in most years. The Federal Emergency Relief Administra-

18 Stein (1996, p. 87) notes that, at least initially, Roosevelt was able to rise above his belief in reducing
expenditures to do what he considered necessary, which was increasing spending.

19 The annual reports of the Treasury categorize federal government expenditures chargeable against ordi-

nary receipts in general and emergency categories in scal years 1934 and 1935. From 1936 to 1939, these
categories are labeled general and recovery and relief. Prior to Roosevelt taking oce, expenditure were
divided into ordinary and another category to retire public debt. In his annual budgetary messages in 1934
and 1935 and in a reside chat on Monday, July 24, 1933, Roosevelt refers to non-emergency expenditures
as regular expenditures. We use the terms regular and ordinary interchangeably to refer to non-emergency
expenditures.

Total Expenditures

Table 3: Federal expenditures by category, millions of dollars. Total expenditures exclude
debt and railroad retirements. Emergency expenditures in this table contain some regular
expenditures resulting in totals that are 10 to 30 percent higher than the ocial emergency
expenditures listed in Table 2. The other emergency expenditures category includes net
loans, subscriptions to stock and surplus, and the agricultural adjustment program. Source:
Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury (p. 354, 1937).

tion (FERA) established in May 1933 replaced many of the relief eorts of the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation (RFC) implemented under Hoover in January 1932. While the RFC
lent primarily to institutions such as states, public entities, or distressed nancial institutions, the FERA made direct grants to states totaling $3.1 billion from 1934 to 1936. States
used proceeds from the FERA for direct relief along with relief programs including sanitation
improvements, repair or construction of public buildings, national park improvements, and
loans and grants to nancially troubled farmers. [Studenski and Krooss (1952, pp. 374, 411)
and Fishback, Kantor, and Wallis (2003)].
In contrast to FERA, the Civil Works Administration (CWA) operated directly under
the federal government and focused on works projects such as building and improving sewer
pipes, roads, schools, playgrounds, and airports as well providing work to teachers, writers,

20

and artists.

From 1934 to 1935, the CWA encompassed $1 billion in federal relief expendi-

tures and employed 4 million workers. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) followed
the CWA and also focused on work relief by spending $8.1 billion between 1936 and 1940 and
employing 2.2 million workers per year on average [Studenski and Krooss (1952, p. 412)].
Projects included highways, slum clearance, reforestation, and rural rehabilitation.
The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) spent $2.5 billion to employ 3 million young
men from 1933 to 1942 on works projects relating to the conservation and development of
natural resources [Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury (1940, p. 27)]. Projects
included planting trees and constructing and upgrading trails and facilities at more than
800 parks nationwide.

The other emergency spending category includes grants to the

Agricultural Adjustment Administration for farm subsidies aimed at raising agricultural
prices, Reconstruction Finance Corporation loans, and other farm and housing assistance
including the Home Owners' Loan Corporation created in June 1933 to assume mortgage
debt of distressed homeowners amounting to $3.1 billion [Studenski and Krooss (1952, p.

417)].
Regular operating expenditures declined under Roosevelt relative to Hoover, except in
1936 due to the payout of the veterans' bonus [Hausman (2016)].

Most of the decline in

regular expenditures can be attributed to the shifting of existing RFC and public works
expenditures to emergency categories starting in 1934 [Annual Report of the Secretary of
the Treasury (1934, p. 5). Although the Economy Act of 1933 cut $243 million of regular
operating expenditures by reducing the pay of civilian and military federal workers by 15
percent and decreasing veterans' benets by 10 percent, Congress eventually restored 95
percent of the pay cuts essentially undoing the budgetary savings [Studenski and Krooss
(1952, p. 404)].

5.2.2 Measuring Fiscal Impulses

Unbacked scal expansion changes the relevant mea-

sure of scal impulse from the surplus-output ratio to the surplus-debt ratio. In expression
(3), the ultimate impact on aggregate demand, and the price level in that example, depends on total real backingright siderelative to oustanding nominal liabilitiesleft side.
Consider the ow government budget constraint written in nominal terms

Bt + St = (1 + it−1 )Bt−1
where

S

is the primary surplus. Then the surplus-debt ratio is

Bt
St
= (1 + it−1 ) −
Bt−1
Bt−1

(4)

Declines in surpluses relative to debt raise nominal debt growth. Higher debt growth without
correspondingly higher surpluses raises nominal wealth and nominal demand. Equation (4)
highlights a key point: lower debt,

Bt−1 ,

implies larger nominal debt growth from a given

decit.
Fiscal stimulus from unbacked expansion hinges on the amount of scal backing relative
to outstanding debt. Keynesian hydraulics focuses narrowly on the size of decits relative
to the economy, leading to Brown's (1956) oft-cited conclusion: Fiscal policy, then, seems
to have been an unsuccessful recovery device in the 'thirtiesnot because it did not work,
but because it was not tried [pp. 863866].
Figure 6, right panel, contrasts the two measures of scal impulse. Data to the right of
the vertical line shows that once government debt expansion

could

be unbacked, decits were

very large relative to debt. Between April 1933 and June 1940, primary decits averaged 5.2
percent of GNP, but 12.5 percent of debt, almost two-and-a-half times larger.

21

5.3 Keynesian Hydraulics vs. Unbacked Fiscal Expansion
Economic theory supports the unbacked scal expansion narrative. Unbacked scal expansions generally have much larger scal spending and tax multipliers than those that arise
under Keynesian hydraulics. This section applies the reasoning in Beck-Friis and Willems
(2017) to contrast scal impacts under the two monetary-scal regimes.

22

21 Aside from World War II, only the decades of the 1970s and 1980s exhibit comparable decit-debt ratios.
22 To make the exposition transparent, we log-linearize the model around its deterministic steady state.
Appendix B provides details, extensions to long-duration debt, and numerical examples.

Government spending and transfer impacts from unbacked scal expansions typically exceed those from Keynesian hydraulics alone.

Keynesian Hydraulics.

The standard Keynesian view of scal expansions assumes

|φπ | > 1
and

β −1 − φT < 1.
This assignment of policy implies monetary policy actively stabilizes ination, while tax
policy passively stabilizes debt. Equilibrium ination and debt dynamics are

of government spending associated with Keynesian hydraulics. Ination is independent of

In contrast to

Keynesian hydraulics, an unbacked scal expansion makes ination depend on all aspects of
scal policy. Debt has monetary consequences, and the timing of taxes and transfers matter.

increase in transfers on ination are

U BTπ (0) = δ −1 (1 − βλ2 ) β
U BTπ (j) = λj2 βλ2
for

j > 0.

The fact that the impact eect depends on the inverse of the debt-to-GDP ratio is

relevant for later resultsthe smaller is outstanding debt relative to GDP the larger will be
the impacts. Equivalently, the larger are decits relative to outstanding debt, the larger the
expansionary eect. Early in the recovery, decits were almost 30 percent of debt [gure 6].
This measure of impulse is fundamentally dierent to standard Keynesian hydraulics logic.
We can now express the eects of government purchases on ination as




U BFπ (j) = KHFπ (j) + 1 − δ β −1 − φπ KHFπ (0) U BTπ (j)
for

j ≥ 0.

(7)

The eects of government purchases on inationand output, though not shown

in an unbacked scal expansion decompose into two components. The rst comes from the
π
eects of spending in the standard Keynesian story, KHF (j). This is the eect of spending
when taxes back debt. The second term comes from the fact that spending does not herald
future tax increases:
demand.

it reects the wealth eects of nominal debt issuance on aggregate

This is why the term depends on the tax multiplier:

it captures the implicit

reduction in taxes, of magnitude equal to the spending impulse, under an unbacked scal
expansion.
A sucient condition for larger impacts from an unbacked scal expansion than under
Keynesian hydraulics is

δ<

β (σ + ω −1 )
κσ

which standard parameter values easily satisfy. For this same reason, Keynesian hydraulics
are small relative to the eects of reduced taxes. This captures the eect of nominal debt
dynamics arising from the commitment not to raise taxesan eect theoretically and empirically large. For example, taking standard parameter values in the new Keynesian model,
and a debt-to-GDP ratio of

40

percent in annual terms, the present discounted value of

output resulting from a one percent

i.i.d.

increase in spending is 4.14 in an unbacked scal

expansion versus 0.977 under Keynesian hydraulics. Prices rise by

42 times the size of response under Keynesian hydraulics.

0.65 in the long run, some

While only meant to be suggestive,

such dierences are a robust feature of the model. There are reasons to think these magnitudes are understated relative to the environment of the 1930s. Infrastructure spending
and transfers to constrained households with high marginal propensities to consume were
important features of FDR's scal strategy, and both would deliver larger multipliers [table
3].

5.4 Government Debt and Unbacked Fiscal Expansion
The theory of unbacked scal expansion just described informs how we interpret government
debt dynamics in the 1930s. The expression for equilibrium real debt, equation (6), implies
that debt-nanced scal expansion is consistent with stable debt, even when that expansion
does not eventually bring forth higher taxes.

Theory explains why signicant growth in

nominal debt did not undermine public credit, as many contemporaneous critics predicted.
Figure 7 summarizes key features of unbacked scal expansion.
model in section 5.3 to plot responses to an

i.i.d.

The gure uses the

increase in government purchases, with

the nominal interest rate pegged in the left panel and responding weakly to ination in the
right panel. Fiscal policy sets taxes independently of debt. By pegging the nominal rate,
monetary policy also pegs bond prices. All debt revaluation arises from a jump in the price
level, so even on impact real debt rises less than nominal debt. Higher government spending
raises expected ination, so the real interest rate falls. The combination of surprise ination
and lower real debt service retire real debt back to steady state.
When monetary policy raises the nominal rate with ination, bond prices fall to introduce
an additional debt-stabilizing mechanism. The market value of real debt rises less than the
par value. Because monetary policy raises the nominal rate, real interest rates decline less
than under a pegged nominal rate.
With no response in future primary surpluses to the scal expansion, how can the value
of debt rise, as it does in both panels of gure 7? The answer lies in real interest rates. Lower
real rates raise the present value of the xed stream of surpluses to increase the current value
of real backing and, therefore, the value of debt.

gross debt doubled during his rst seven years in oce. By comparison, seven scal years
after the nancial crisis in 2008, U.S. gross federal debt increased by a factor of 1.8.
The left panel of gure 8 plots index numbers for nominal and real federal debt. Taken
together, the two panels highlight central features of unbacked scal expansions: despite
increases in nominal debt, real debt rises less dramatically and there may be no increase at
all in debt as a share of income. The index equals 100 in 1932Q2 to 1933Q1, the year leading
up to America's departure from the gold standard. After declining for a decade, nominal
debt began to rise in 1931; real debt started to increase a year earlier, due to deation.
From 1933Q2 until 1940Q2, the par value of nominal debt rose 112 percent, while real debt
rose 82 percent. The ratio of these indexes reached its nadir when the country left gold and
then rose 19 percent by 1940Q2, but 22 percent just before the 19371938 recession. Those
changes in the ratio measure how much debt was devalued by a higher price level.

23

More striking is the right panel of the gure. The debt-GNP ratio, whether measured at
par or market value of debt, rose sharply from 15 percent in 1930 to 42 percent at the time
gold was abandoned. Then it hovered around 40 percent for the next six years, until the
recession raised the ratio. In the last few years of the decade, when Roosevelt abandoned
the unbacked scal expansion policy, the debt-GNP ratio rose.
Figure 9 performs the accounting exercise that breaks the growth rate of the debt-GNP
ratio in gure 8,

Bt /Pt Yt ,

into growth rates of the three components. All three drove debt-

output in the three years before Roosevelt took oce. From the rst quarter of 1933 on,
nominal debt contributed to driving the ratio higher. That inuence, though, was oset by
higher prices and real GNP, with the exception of the recession of 193738.

23 These numbers are nearly identical when measured in terms of the market value of debt.

Revaluation eects on nominal debt are a distinctive feature of unbacked scal expansion.
Several patterns emerge from returns data in table 4. First, nominal returns are comparable

25

across the gold standard and unbacked scal expansion period.

Second, real returns are

substantially higher in the gold standard period than in the later period (average annual real
returns of 7.86 percent versus 1.20 percent). Finally, on average, surprises in real returns are
strongly positive in the early period (4.81 percent), but negative during the unbacked scal
expansions (−0.76 percent).

26

These patterns are fully consistent with surprise ination

devaluing government debt during Roosevelt's administration.

25 Return data start in 1926, so gold standard refers to 1926Q1 to 1933Q1.
26 Romer (1992, p. 778) estimates the ex-ante real commercial paper rate to nd that it is negative nearly
the entire unbacked scal expansion period except the 19371938 recession.

Surprise real returns on government debt are quantitatively important. Figure 10 shows
that as a percentage of the market value of outstanding debt, these revaluationscomputed
M M
M
M
as ηt Pt−1 Bt−1 /Pt Bt are a central feature of scal nancing (left panel). After leaving
the gold standard, surprise revaluations are both large and frequently negative. With debt
at 40 percent of GNP, the revaluations are several percentage points of output, a substantial
fraction of primary decits.

27

The decomposition of surprise real returns, graphed in the right panel of gure 10, conrms that before leaving the gold standard, high realized real returns were driven by low
ination. The negative spike due to bond prices in 1931Q4 was created by the Fed's eorts
to defend the gold parity by sharply raising discount rates. In the period of unbacked scal
expansions, again with the exception of the jump in early 1938, surprise devaluations of debt
from ination dominate the surprise real returns.
The last informal piece of empirical evidence about the unbacked scal expansion appears in gure 11, which plots the relative price of the bond portfolio. This relative price is
M
computed as the real market value of debt over the par value of debt, which yields Pt /Pt ,
the goods-price of government bonds. Bonds became increasingly costly in terms of goods

27 Sims (2013) computes surprise capital gains and losses on U.S. government bonds since World War II
to argue that these revaluation eects are importantthe same order of magnitude as annual uctuations
in primary surpluses. Of course, any stochastic model with monetary and scal policy in which ination
and interest rates uctuate will generate revaluation eects.

This holds regardless of the monetary-scal

policy regime, so merely nding revaluation eects during the recovery of the 1930s does not imply that the
United States experienced an unbacked scal expansion. Such an inference requires identifying assumptions,
to which we turn in section 6.

throughout the gold standard period, reaching a peak in 1933Q1. With the departure from
gold came a steady devaluation of the bond portfolio, bottoming out in the middle of 1937
when the 19371938 recession began. This cheapening of bonds is consistent with bondholders substituting out of debt and into buying goods and servicesan increase in aggregate
demand triggered by unbacked scal expansion.

6 Structural VAR Analysis
We turn now to more formal analysis of scal and monetary impacts over the period of
unbacked scal expansions. Because the identied VAR methodology is well understood, we
review it only briey here.

28

6.1 VAR Methods
If

yt

is a

k×1

vector of time series, the economic structure is

A0 yt = A+ (L)yt−1 + εt
where

Eεt ε0t = I

and

εt

is uncorrelated with

ys

for

s < t.

(15)
The

εt 's

are economically inter-

pretable exogenous disturbances. The reduced-form is

yt = B(L)yt−1 + ut
where, assuming that
−1 0
A−1
0 (A0 ) = Σ.

6.2 Data and Identification
We estimate a seven-variable monthly VAR from April 1933 to June 1940. The seven variables are:

the commercial paper rate,

primary surplus,

S,

i,

(NSA), the monetary base,

M,

(NSA), federal

(SA), the market value of nominal gross federal government debt,

(NSA), the monetary gold stock,

G,

(NSA), monthly interpolated GNP deator,

1926), and monthly interpolated real GNP,

Y .29

P,

B,

(100 =

VAR estimates employ the Sims and Zha (1998) prior, which allows for unit roots and
cointegration, and probability bands are computed as in Sims and Zha (1999). All variables
except the primary surplus and the interest rate are logged; the interest rate is divided by
100 to put it in percentage units. We include six lags and a constant.

30

The identication aims to be consistent with actual policy behavior in the post-gold
standard period of the 1930s.

We impose restrictions only on

A0 ,

the contemporaneous

interactions among innovations in variables, leaving lags unrestricted. With monthly time
series, this means every variable responds to past values of every other variable.
Money Supply : The supply of monetary base, M s , depends on the short-term nominal
interest rate,

R,

and the monetary gold stock,

G.

The decision about whether or not to

sterilize gold inows lay with the Treasury during this period, but in the case when inows
s
were not sterilized, there was a direct impact of G on M . In addition, the Federal Reserve
might decide to adjust supply in order to inuence interest rates, so we have the money
supply rule

P
a1 Mts = a2 it + a3 Gt + εM
t

(17)

Money Demand : The demand for base money is a derived demand. Demand for nominal
M d , depends on the short-term nominal interest rate, the price level, P ,
and income, Y
D
a4 Mtd = a5 Pt + a6 it + a7 Yt + εM
(18)
t

money balances,

Fiscal Policy :

Fiscal policy chooses the primary surplus,

S.

Revenues are procyclical

and an unindexed tax code makes revenues depend on the price level.

Because surplus

movements in the period were dominated by FDR's emergency spending programs, which
were a reaction to prevailing economic conditions, there was little contemporaneous reaction
of scal choices to variables other than measures of the price level and real economic activity.
We also permit a contemporaneous response of surpluses to the nominal market value of debt,

29 Primary surpluses were seasonally adjusted using the X-11 procedure in RATS. The deator and real
GNP were interpolated from Balke and Gordon's (1986) quarterly series using the Chow and Lin (1971) algorithm. Monthly series used to interpolate the deator included M2, the consumer price index, the wholesale
price index, the long-term yield on Treasury bonds (NBER Macrohistory Database, m13033a), and index
composite wages (NBER Macrohistory Database, m08061c); series used to interpolate real GNP included
industrial production, composite index of six roughly coincident series (NBER Macrohistory Database,
m16003a); index of factory employment, total durable goods (NBER Macrohistory Database, m08146a),
and production worker employment, manufacturing (NBER Macrohistory Database, m08010b). Appendices
A.1 and A.2 describe scal data in detail and compare our series to three widely used sourcesNBER
Macrohistory Database, Firestone (1960), and Romer (1992).

30 In notation analogous to that in Sims and Zha (1998), these results set the hyperparameters for the prior

as

µ1 = 0.6, µ2 = 0.3, µ3 = 1.0, µ4 = 1.75, µ5 = 2.0, µ6 = 2.0.

The prior was chosen based on the model's

marginal data density. See gure 24 in appendix D for the model's unconditional forecasts under this prior.

This leads to the scal rule

a8 St = a9 Bt + a10 Pt + a11 Yt + εPt S
Government Debt :

(19)

We measure government debt as the nominal market value of gross

federal debt. Because bond prices react immediately to all shocks in the economy,

B

is an

information variable, in Leeper, Sims, and Zha's (1996) terminology. The debt equation is

a12 Bt = a13 it + a14 Mt + a15 St + a16 Gt + a17 Pt + a18 Yt + εB
t
Gold :

(20)

With the passage of the Gold Reserve Act in January 1934, the Treasury bought

all gold supplied at the price chosen by the Treasury and the President, which was $34.00
an ounce. This made the demand for gold perfectly elastic at that price. Supply of gold to
America, on the other hand, was driven by both exogenous political conditions in Europe
and endogenous factors within the United States. Among those endogenous factors were the
relative strength of the U.S. recovery, U.S. willingness to buy unlimited quantities of gold
at a high price, increased sale of U.S. merchandise abroad as the dollar depreciated, the
inow of capital to the United States, and foreign-owned capital sent to U.S. to build up
dollar balances or to purchase American securities [Paris (1938)]. We model the supply of
monetary gold as a function of the nominal interest rate and goods-market conditions:

a19 Gt = a20 it + a21 Pt + a22 Yt + εG
t
Goods Market :

(21)

We refer to the remaining variables in the VARthe price level and real

GNPas goods market variables.

We treat these as inertial variables that are predeter-

mined and obey a recursive ordering. The limitation in this assumption is that we do not
distinguish between the two goods market shocks, treating them simply as disturbances
unrelated to the behavior identied in other equations

a23 Pt = a24 Yt + εPt

(22)

a25 Yt = εYt

(23)

Predeterminedness of goods market variables is not a stringent restriction: it says that the
price level and output do not respond to non-goods-market shocks within the month, as
assumption that Romer (1992) employs with annual data.
The identication determines the money stock, the nominal interest rate, the gold stock,
nominal debt, and the primary surplus simultaneously, with

P

and

Y

predetermined.

With 28 distinct moments in the covariance matrix of innovations and 25 freely estimated
parameters, the system is overidentied. If data strongly reject the overidentifying restrictions, the estimated exogenous disturbances may not be mutually uncorrelated, muddling
the economic interpretations of the shocks.
Table 5 reports posterior modes and 68-percent probability intervals for the estimated parameters. The money supply rule is consistent with the central bank expanding high-powered
money in response to surprise increases in the nominal interest rate. Contemporaneous interactions between gold and the base are weak.

Money demand has a negative but weak

interest elasticity, but positive and signicant short-run income and price elasticities.

31

A

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
negative contemporaneous relation between debt and surpluses likely emerges from the government's ow budget constraint. Primary surpluses are weakly connected to goods market
innovations, although over longer horizons real economic activity does aect surpluses. Real
income innovations raise the monetary gold stock, which is consistent with the U.S. economic
recovery inducing gold inows from abroad, which are met by an elastic demand for gold
by the Treasury.

Finally, the nominal market value of government bonds is signicantly

associated with contemporaneous innovations in variables, reecting the responsiveness of
asset prices to news. Those contemporaneous relationships make good economics sense: a
surprisingly high market value of bonds is associated with negative innovations in the interest
rate, money stock, primary surpluses, and the price level, but positive innovations in gold.

31

Strong eects are associated with the interest rate and ination, as theory would suggest.

6.3 Primary Surplus Impacts
Figure 12 reports the dynamic impacts of a surprise decrease in the real primary surplus
during the unbacked scal expansion period. The one standard deviation initial shock raises
the primary decit by $0.21 billion, which is about half of the average annualized monthly
decit in the sample. Because the decit decays rapidly, the total increase over the threeyear forecast horizon is only $0.51 billion.

This is a relatively small and transitory scal

impulse. Higher decits do not bring forth higher future surpluses, lending support to the
interpretation that scal expansion is unbacked.

31 Appendix D reports that the exogenous shocks in this model are mutually uncorrelated [see table 4].

33

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
Higher decits produce Keynesian impacts. Prices and output, which the identication
prevents from rising contemporaneously, steadily increase and signicantly so.

Monetary

policy makes no eort to oset the inationary consequences of the scal expansion, suggesting the Fed behaves passively. Nominal interest rates fall slightly in the short run. The
lower nominal rates, together with higher expected ination, drive

ex-ante

real rates lower.

Lower real rates induce households and rms to shift demand for goods into the present.
New nominal bonds nance the higher decits.

Debt jumps on impact and remains

elevated. Economic recovery encourages gold to ow into the United States. By choosing not
to sterilize gold inows, the Treasury allows the monetary base to expand to accommodate
rising demand for money.
Looking down the column in gure 12 it is easy to see the conventional monetary narrative of the recovery that Friedman and Schwartz (1963), Romer (1992), and Steindl (2004)

32

recount.

The initial revaluation of gold, together with the steady inows of gold largely

due to political uncertainty in Europe, were permitted by the Treasury to steadily increase
the monetary base. Expansion in high-powered money stimulated real activity and raised
prices. At the same time, enhanced condence in banks after the early 1930s crises reduced
cash hoarding and raised the income velocity of money to reinforce the expansionary eects
of the growth in the base.
But the impulse responses create a problem for this conventional narrative. How does
one reconcile monetary-induced economic recovery with the sharp short-run declines in primary surpluses and the persistent increase in nominal government debt? Existing literature
does not address this question, primarily because the scal dimensions have not been fully
integrated with the monetary interpretations of the recovery.

6.4 Monetary Impacts
Higher decits generate positive comovements among output, the price level, the monetary
base, and the gold stock.

But that interpretation ascribes to scal policy a causal role.

Perhaps those scally-induced correlations are but a small part of the story about the recovery. Perhaps other disturbances, unrelated to scal policy, generate the same comovements,
but account for the bulk of uctuations in output and prices, as the conventional monetary
narrative maintains.
We address these concerns by examining four other impulse response functions. Figure
13 reports the dynamic impacts of four shocks related to the monetary sectormonetary
policy, money demand, government debt, and the supply of gold. Our identication does
not attach any distinct behavioral interpretation to the shock in the equation for debt, but

33

does to the other three disturbances.

From early 1933 until December 1936, the Treasury opted not to sterilize gold inows,
which permitted the monetary base to expand along with the gold stock. We view gure 13

32 Friedman and Schwartz give this narrative a dierent twist than Romer. Friedman and Schwartz (1963,
p. 499) write that  . . . the rise in the money stock [from 1933 to 1937] was produced not by the monetary
authorities but by gold inow. Though accidental gold inows served the same economic function as compliant monetary authorities would have, it occurred despite rather than because of the actions of unions,
business organizations, and government in pushing up prices. Romer, in contrast, attributes much of the
growth in base money to a policy choicethe Treasury's decision not to sterilize the inows.

33 Figure 25 in appendix D reports the full moving average representation.

34

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
with an eye toward shocks that move base money strongly and persistently. The rst two
columnsa monetary policy contraction and an increase in money demandgenerate such
movements, but only monetary policy moves the gold stock appropriately, but then does so
only insignicantly. In any case, neither shock has signicant impacts on the price level or
real GNP.
Shocks to the supply of goldthe fourth column of the gureare the genesis of the
conventional monetary narrative. They are an important source of gold-stock uctuations,
but little else. Positive innovations in gold are followed by a higher monetary base, although
not signicantly higher; if anything, though, higher monetary gold leads to lower prices
and real GNP. The prime candidate for the monetary narrative shock does not deliver the
required comovements of macro variables.
Innovations to the market value of debt are followed by a higher gold stock, monetary
base (insignicantly), and price level (briey signicantly).

But the debt innovation also

creates a transitory decline in the surplus that arises from the coecient on

B

in the third

equation in table 5. As we found in gure 12, excursions in variables that look like the conventional monetary narrative arise only in conjunction with signicant movement in primary
surpluses.

34

Only disturbances to the primary surplus generate the full set of movements in assets, the
price level, and real GNP that would seem to align with existing monetary explanations of the
recovery. Figure 12's responses to a shock that raises the primary decit are fully consistent
with what the theory predicts for the consequences of an unbacked scal expansion.

We

turn now to how important these scal disturbances are in generating uctuations in the
variables of interest.

6.5 Quantitative Importance
Variance and historical decompositions help to assess the quantitative importance of scal
policy for the economic recovery. Those decompositions measure how important each exogenous shock is for future movements in the variables in the VAR. This section also reports
output multipliers for several VAR specications.

6.5.1 Variance Decompositions

Table 6 reports variance decompositions of the seven

variables in the VAR at 6- and 36-month horizons. These statistics record how important
disturbances in each exogenous shock are for explaining uctuations in the variables, on
average over the estimated sample.
Looking rst at the goods market variables,

P

and

Y,

in the rst two panels, aside from

own shocks, the only disturbance that accounts for an important fraction of error variance in
those variables comes from scal policy. A bit under 20 percent of goods market variables'
uctuations arise from shocks to the primary surplus.

Monetary disturbancesmonetary

policy, money demand, and gold owsjointly explain at most only 5.5 percent.

34 An identication that excludes

B

from the

S

equation does not produce a signicant response of the

surplus to a debt innovation, and it also does not produce strong responses in gold, money, or the price level.
We do not report that result because the identication produces a non-zero correlation between the shocks
to surpluses and money demand.

Money market shocks together account for substantial fractions of error variances in
the monetary base (49 percent) and the commercial paper rate (87 percent). But primary
surpluses explain almost all the remaining variance in base money (39 percent), suggesting
a strong endogenous response of money to scal disturbances.
Primary surplusesthe fth panelare largely exogenous, with own shocks accounting
for 92 percent of surplus movements at all horizons.

This nding is consistent with Roo-

sevelt's emergency spending driving scal policy in the period. Of course, this spending
was most decidedly

not exogenous

in the usual meaning of the term because the spending

was an explicit response to economic conditions in the preceding years.
Primary surplus disturbances explain 27 percent of the forecast error variance in gold.
This nding belies the argument by Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and others that gold
inows were almost entirely due to European political turmoil and gold discoveries.

Of

course, a substantial fraction (60 percent) of uctuations in gold are due to exogenous shocks
in demand and supply for gold, which may reect the factors that Friedman and Schwartz
emphasize. As gure 13 reports, though, positive shocks to gold supply do not produce the
higher price levels and output associated with recovery.

Figures 14 and 15 decompose the historical paths of the price level and real GNP into
three of the components in (25). After accounting for lags in the VAR estimation, forecasts
run from October 1933 through June 1940. Solid lines are actual values,

E0 yjt .

yjt , and solid dotted

The remaining three lines are actual values less the contributions

of primary surplus disturbances for the model in table 5 and two recursive orderings.
Forecasts of both the price level and real GNP rise monotonically over the period, suggesting that in the absence of shocks, deterministic dynamics over the sample would raise
prices and output. The marginal contribution of surpluses appears as the vertical distance
between the actual value and the value less that group's addition. A consistent pattern across
both gures and all three identications is that absent scal shocks, prices and output would
have been lower over most of the sample, except around 1939.

real GNP is in logs, while the surplus is in real dollars, so we scale the impulse response by

the mean of real GNP. Figure 15 makes clear that GNP grew over the sample period, so we
compute the multipliers using two dierent measures of the meanthe full sample period
and the rst year of the sample.
Output multipliers are large and persistent. Taking the average of output over the full

Credible sets expand over the forecast horizon, but remain above zero over the three-year
horizon in the gure. The peak multiplier falls to 3.6 when the mean of real GNP is based
on the rst year of the sample. Multipliers are not appreciably dierent under the recursive
orderings.

7 Lessons for Today
We have argued that unbacked scal expansion was the critical policy action that contributed
to recovery from the Great Depression. Roosevelt's try anything policies produced debtnanced primary decits that remained in place until recovery was underway.

Monetary

policy combined with that scal policy to stabilize debt by preventing nominal interest rates
from rising with ination. The paper oers a variety of evidence that debt-nanced decits
generated gold inows and expanded the monetary base at the same time that they raised
prices and output. Gold inows and higher base money that are not associated with higher

36 Appendix D reports results for a recursively ordered eight-variable VAR that splits the primary surplus
into expenditures net of interest payments and tax receipts.

Multipliers for government expenditures are

comparable to those in gure 16, though less precisely estimated. Tax multipliers are highly uncertain.

40

Jacobson, Leeper, & Preston: 1933
decits and nominal debt contain little predictive power for the GNP deator and real GNP.
Despite rapid growth in nominal debt between 1933 and 1937, the debt-GNP ratio was stable
at about 40 percent, the level it had reached before the United States abandoned gold. This
leads to the conclusion that unbacked scal expansion helped to lift the U.S. economy out
of the depression without endangering the creditworthiness of the country.
Roosevelt's successful, if incomplete, reation carries two important lessons for policymakers today. Many countries now suer from lowbelow-targetination rates and tepid
economic growth. Rather than relying on a joint monetary-scal attack on the problem, as
Roosevelt did, these countries are leaning entirely on monetary policy. Central banks in the
Euro Area, Sweden, Switzerland, and Japan have set policy interest rates below zero and
undertaken large-scale asset purchases in an eort to reduce real interest rates and stimulate
aggregate demand and ination. This policy relies on intertemporal substitution induced by
low real rates, rather than the wealth eects of an unbacked scal expansion. Fiscal policies
in those areas, meanwhile, have lacked Roosevelt's initial single-minded goal to stimulate
the economy, uctuating between scal stimulus and scal austerity. Despite the Herculean
eorts of monetary authorities for several years, reation has been slow to come to those
countries.
Ironically, those same countries and the United Kingdom, like the United States in the
1930s, are well positioned to undertake unbacked scal expansions. Monetary policies are
already passive and central banks are on board to achieve higher ination rates.

37

A second lesson from the Roosevelt policies is that scal stimulus and scal sustainability
need not be in conict. When the aim is to raise ination and economic growth, higher nominal government debtif people are convinced it does not portend higher future taxescan
achieve both the macroeconomic objectives and the goal of stabilizing debt. The two goals
go hand-in-hand: higher ination reduces the real value of the debt and higher economic
growth raises surpluses and reduces debt-output ratios.

But to engineer an unbacked s-

cal expansion, governments must understand that rapid growth in

nominal

debt need not

threaten scal sustainability, just as it didn't in 1930s America.
In the current atmosphere of what Sims (2016b) calls hyper-Ricardian beliefs about
policy in which the public sees higher debt as bringing forth much higher surpluses in the
future, it may be dicult for policymakers to credibly commit to an unbacked scal expansion. Here, too, FDR may have something to teach. Roosevelt never claimed to be aiming for
what even he might have regarded as irresponsible scal policy. But his communications
and actions made clear that he was willing to do whatever it took to bring the country out
of the depression.

Roosevelt was also agnostic, willing to experiment, even with what at

the time seemed to be radical policies. He kept the public's attention on the policy

tives,

objec-

objectives over which there was nearly universal agreement, rather than on the policy

tools. And he made policy actions explicitly state-dependent. Today, state-dependence is

rigueur

de

among central banks. It rarely enters the scal calculus.

37 Because individual Euro Area countries do not control their monetary policy, it would require a coordinated unbacked scal expansion across member nations together with the ECB's pegging of interest
rates.
