    "abstract": "\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Building and Loans (B&Ls), the leading home lenders, had a structure that mitigated the crisis.  Borrowers were owners of the B&L and dissolution of the institution required a two-thirds majority vote.  Using panel data from New Jersey in the 1930s, we find that this voting rule delayed dissolution by about one year.  The year delay allowed one-fourth of the borrowers in the at-risk B&L to pay off their loans, but nonborrowers lost share value.  The net loss was roughly -0.67 percent of the value of all New Jersey B&L assets in the mid-1930s.\n\n",
