    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper discusses U.S. energy policy and the associated evolution of energy supply, energy demand, energy prices and the industrial organization of the domestic energy industries during the period 1991 through 2000.  This period covers the last two years of the George H. W.  Bush administration and the entire Clinton administration. The paper begins with a background discussion of energy supply, consumption and energy policy prior to the 1990s.  It then  provides an overview of the evolution of energy markets and energy policy during the 1990s.  This discussion is followed by a more detailed discussion of supply, demand and public policies affecting the primary sources of energy supply and demand during the 1990s: petroleum, natural gas, electricity, coal, nuclear energy, renewable energy and energy efficiency.\n\n",
