    "abstract": "\n\nIt is often useful to price assets and other random payoffs by reference to other observed prices rather than construct full-fledged economic asset pricing models.  This approach breaks down if one cannot find a perfect replicating portfolio.  We impose weak economic restrictions to derive usefully tight bounds on asset prices in this situation.  The bounds basically rule out high Sharpe ratios - `good deals' - as well as arbitrage opportunities.  We present the method of calculation, we extend it to a multiperiod context by finding a recursive solution, and we apply it to option pricing examples including the Black-Scholes setup with infrequent trading, and a model with stochastic stock volatility and a varying riskfree rate.\n\n",
