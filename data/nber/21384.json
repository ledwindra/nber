    "abstract": "\n\nWe construct datasets of linked census records to study internal migrants\u2019 selection and destination choices during the first decades of the \u201cGreat Migration\u201d (1910-1930).  We study both whites and blacks and intra- and inter-regional migration.  While there is some evidence of positive selection, the degree of selection was small and participation in migration was widespread.  Differences in background, including initial location, cannot account for racial differences in destination choices.  Blacks and whites were similarly responsive to pre-existing migrant stocks from their home state, but black men were more deterred by distance, attracted to manufacturing, and responsive to labor demand.\n\n",
