    "abstract": "\n\nExpenditures on teacher salaries in US public schools exceeds $200 billion annually, yet there is no existing evidence on whether this spending level is efficient. We fill this gap by developing a theoretical test for efficiency based on the causal impact of salary spending and taxes on local house prices. We empirically implement the test on a national sample of school districts from 1990-2015, using a research design that generates quasi-random variation in public school spending and taxes. We find that a tax-funded increase in salary spending would raise house prices, indicating that spending on teacher salaries is inefficiently low.\n\n",
