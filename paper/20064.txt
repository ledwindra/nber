ABSTRACT
Bloom, Canning, and Fink (2014) argue that the results in Acemoglu and Johnson (2006, 2007) are
not robust because initial level of life expectancy (in 1940) should be included in our regressions of
changes in GDP per capita on changes in life expectancy. We assess their claims controlling for potential
lagged effects of initial life expectancy using data from 1900, employing a nonlinear estimator suggested
by their framework, and using information from microeconomic estimates on the effects of improving
health. There is no evidence for a positive effect of life expectancy on GDP per capita in this important
historical episode.

Introduction

Beginning in the 1940s, a wave of health innovations and more eﬀective international public
health measures led to a rapid and large improvement in health – for example, in some
relatively poor countries, life expectancy at birth quickly rose from around 40 years to over
60 years. In Acemoglu and Johnson (2006, 2007, hereafter AJ) we constructed an instrument
for these changes in life expectancy: “predicted mortality,” which is calculated from initial
mortality by disease and the timing of global disease interventions. Across a wide range of
specifications, our work suggests no positive eﬀects – over 40 or 60 year horizons – of life
expectancy on GDP per capita (or GDP per working age population).
Bloom, Canning, and Fink (2014, hereafter BCF) argue that the level of life expectancy in
1940 aﬀected subsequent growth rates and should be included in our long-diﬀerence specifications, i.e., the level of life expectancy in 1940 should be included on the right-hand side when
1940-1980 or 1940-2000 changes in GDP per capita are the dependent variables. In a linear
regression framework, their specification introduces a great deal of multicollinearity and the
standard errors become very large.
The specifications in AJ (2006, 2007) allowed for potential long-run eﬀects of health improvements, and supported our empirial strategy by showing that changes in the predicted
mortality instrument were uncorrelated with its own past changes and past changes in population, GDP, and GDP per capita. There are three further ways to assess BCF’s concerns.
First, we include the initial level of life expectancy from 1900, interacted with time dummies
in our decadal panel data set (which runs from 1940). Second, we use a nonlinear estimator
suggested by BCF’s framework to estimate directly their proposed equation with reasonable
precision. Third, from microeconomic estimates in Ashraf, Lester, and Weil (2009, hereafter
ALW) we calculate potential macroeconomic eﬀects of current life expectancy on future growth
and examine the implications for our baseline findings. Our results remain robust throughout.

The Estimating Framework

Our estimating equation in AJ (2006, 2007) was,
+ =  +   +  + Z0 θ + + 

1

(1)

Here  denotes country and  is time period;  is log GDP per capita;  is log life expectancy
(at birth or at other ages); the   ’s denote a full set of fixed eﬀects to capture cross-country
diﬀerences in time-invariant characteristics; the  ’s incorporate time-varying factors common
across all countries; and Z denotes a vector of other controls. (We use the subscript  +  as
a shorthand for   + ). The case where   0 allows for lagged eﬀects of life expectancy.
We instrumented life expectancy with predicted mortality, constructed as:
 =

X

∈D

((1 −  )40 +    ) 

(2)

where  denotes mortality in country  from disease  at time ,  is a dummy for intervention on disease  at time  (equal to 1 for all dates after the intervention), and D denotes
a set of 15 infectious diseases for which we have data – including most major communicable
causes of death around the world in 1940, as well as some less common killers. 40 refers to
the pre-intervention mortality from disease  in the same units, while   is the mortality
rate from disease  at the health frontier of the world at time . For our baseline instrument,
  is set equal to zero.
Any change in life expectancy is unlikely to have its full eﬀect on any demographic or
economic variables instantaneously – or even in the same decade. For this reason, in AJ
(2007), we estimated equation (1) in long diﬀerences, i.e., regressing change on change in a
panel including only two years, 0 and 1 (in practice 1940 and 1980, or 1940 and 2000). In
AJ (2006) we also presented a range of panel specifications using decadal observations; these
results were very similar to those from the long-diﬀerence specifications that were emphasized
in AJ (2007). We explicitly discussed the adjustment dynamics of population and GDP, and
allowed for potential health eﬀects to show up after a long lag – after 40 or 60 years in the
long-diﬀerence specifications and with 10, 20, 30 or 40 year horizons in panel specifications.
BCF propose a “partial adjustment model” that takes the following form:1
∆ = ∆ + −1 − −1 +  +   

(3)

where ∆ ≡  − −1 , and ∆ is defined similarly. They derive this from our equation (1),
assuming an AR(1) specification for the error term ( = −1 +   ). This equation allows
for convergence dynamics (through the  term) and a potential impact of the lagged level of
1

This is their equation (3), using their notation, except that we denote the error term by   to distinguish
it from our error term,  , in (1), and we use  instead of their  for consistency.

log life expectancy, −1 , on subsequent changes in GDP per capita.

The Impact of Initial Life Expectancy

BCF’s IV regressions generate very imprecise estimates for the eﬀect of life expectancy on
GDP per capita. This simply reflects the fact that it is impossible to distinguish the impact
of the level of life expectancy in 1940 (−1 ) and of the subsequent change in life expectancy
(∆ ) in long diﬀerence using only the variation in predicted mortality ( ).
If the true eﬀect of life expectancy on GDP per capita were positive – for example, because
the level of life expectancy aﬀects subsequent changes in GDP per capita – then estimates
of the relationship between changes in life expectancy and changes in GDP per capita over
a 60-year horizon should capture much of these positive eﬀects even if there are reasonable
lags.2 Our long-diﬀerence specifications should thus reveal any long-run, positive relationship
between life expectancy and GDP per capita. Our estimates in AJ (2006 and 2007) using
60-year changes show no such positive eﬀect.
There are three further ways to check if potential long-term eﬀects from lagged life expectancy modify any of our conclusions: (a) run panel regressions including initial life expectancy in 1900, interacted with time dummies, (b) employ a nonlinear estimator implied by
BCF’s equation (3), and (c) use reasonable estimates for direct eﬀects of health improvements
based on microeconomic evidence.

3.1

Controlling for Initial Life Expectancy

To facilitate comparison with models that control for the eﬀect of initial life expectancy, column
1 of Table 1 reports baseline estimates of (1) using decadal observations as in the panel data
models of AJ (2006). Panel A is for 1940-1980 and Panel B is for 1940-2000.3 The standard
errors in this and subsequent models are robust and allow for arbitrary serial correlation at
the country level. In column 1 of Panel A, ̂ = −1307, with a standard error of 0455,
indicating a negative impact of life expectancy on GDP per capita. Column 1 of Panel B
shows a similar estimate that is larger in absolute value (i.e., more negative) for the period
2
For example, even if only a third of the impact of lagged life expectancy on GDP per capita materializes
over a generation (i.e., over 20 years), the bulk of these eﬀects should be evident in our specification using
60-year changes (1940 to 2000).
3
We have data on GDP, life expectancy, and other variables of interest every 10 years from 1940 to 2000. We
also look at the period 1940-1980 to avoid the potential eﬀects of the onset of HIV-AIDS as a global disease.

3

1940-2000, ̂ = −1394.4
The remaining columns in Table 1 include a full set of time interactions with log life
expectancy in 1900 – allowing initial life expectancy to flexibly impact future GDP per capita.
Using the 1900 value for life expectancy, rather than the 1940 level, alleviates the mechanical
correlation between 1940 life expectancy and predicted mortality. It is equally valid if there is
an impact from the level of initial life expectancy on future growth as proposed by BCF.5
Column 2 shows results from including these interactions without controlling for lagged
GDP per capita. In Panel A, the estimate is ̂ = −0100 with a standard error of 0421. Thus
there is a negative (and far from significant) impact of life expectancy on GDP per capita,
which is much smaller than the estimate in column 1. The estimate in Panel B (̂ = −0928,
s.e. = 0486) is larger in absolute value (i.e., more negative), much closer to the estimate in
column 1, and marginally statistically significant.
In addition to year dummies interacted with initial life expectancy, column 3 adds a full
set of time interactions with log GDP per capita in 1940. These interactions are useful, since
any correlation with initial GDP per capita might otherwise load on to initial life expectancy.
In Panel A, we now estimate ̂ = −0270 (s.e. = 0522) The coeﬃcient on life expectancy in
Panel B is larger, −1317, very similar to our baseline estimate in column 1, and statistically
significant at 5% (s.e. = 0627).
Columns 4 and 5 add lagged log GDP per capita to the right-hand side, allowing for
convergence eﬀects. These two columns, respectively, use the standard 2SLS estimator and
Arellano and Bond’s (1991) optimally weighted two-step Generalized Method of Moments
(GMM) estimator, with predicted mortality as external instrument. The results are again
broadly consistent with our baseline results. The GMM estimate in column 5 is ̂ = −0171
(s.e. = 0.393) in the 1940-1980 panel, and a larger (in absolute value), more precise, and
statistically significant ̂ = −0598 (s.e. = 0.234) in the 1940-2000 panel.
4

These balanced panel estimates are very close to those reported in columns 1 and 2 of the unbalanced panel
of Table 11 in AJ (2006) and to the long diﬀerences in columns 1 and 2 of Table 7, Panel B in AJ (2007).
5
Econometrically, we are controlling for the eﬀects of initial life expectancy by including a full set of time
dummies interacted with initial life expectancy, i.e., terms of the form  × 1900 (one for each ). This strategy
potentially controls for two types of eﬀects. The first is that life expectancy in 1900, 1900 , directly impacts
outcomes in subsequent years. The second is that the year  equation contains the term   ×−1 (thus allowing
for a general impact of lagged life expectancy). In this latter case, we can substitute for −1 in terms of log life
expectancy in 1900, 1900 . For example, following the model for the dynamics of life expectancy estimated in
Table 6 of AJ (2007, equation (12), p.957), suppose that  = −1 +   , with decadal observations and  
being serially uncorrelated and orthogonal to other variables. Then substitute for −1 and its lags successively
to obtain −1 =  −1 1900 +  −1 +  −2 +  2  −3 + , with 0 = 1900 . Then the coeﬃcient on −1 in
the year  equation would be   ×  −1 , and all other coeﬃcients can be estimated consistently.

4

Overall, controlling for the eﬀects of initial life expectancy changes our point estimates,
especially for the 1940-1980 period. However, in no case is there any evidence for a positive
eﬀect of life expectancy on GDP per capita, and the estimates in Table 1 for 1940-2000 show
statistically significant negative eﬀects of life expectancy on GDP per capita that are close in
magnitude to the baseline results of AJ (2006, 2007).

3.2

Nonlinear Generalized Method of Moments

We can directly estimate BCF’s proposed equation (3) using a nonlinear GMM approach (with
nonlinear equivalents of the moment conditions used in column 5 of Table 1). Estimates for 
and  obtained in this fashion are shown in Table A1 of the Online Appendix. These imply
long-run negative eﬀects of life expectancy on GDP per capita that are very similar to our
baseline results for both 1940-1980 and 1940-2000. For example, ̂ is estimated as −1261 for
1940-80 and −1548 for 1940-2000, while our original estimates ranged from −121 to −270.6

3.3

Directly Incorporating Lagged Eﬀects of Life Expectancy

An alternative strategy is to directly incorporate the potential eﬀect of initial life expectancy in
the long-diﬀerence specification from AJ (2007). Rewriting BCF’s estimating equation gives:
∆̃ ≡ ∆ − −1 = ∆ − −1 +  +   

(4)

Although we do not know the precise value of  (= ), the microeconomic literature –
surveyed by ALW (2009) – provides guidance on how large this could be. Specifically, we use
their estimates to obtain an upper bound for plausible values of  by supposing that all of the
potential eﬀects of initial life expectancy are captured by .
In our sample, life expectancy among the countries with high initial mortality increased
from about 40 to over 60 between 1940 and 1980. Increasing median life expectancy from 40
to 60 years would, according to ALW’s base estimate, raise GDP per capita by 15 percent in
the long-run (over 60 years). Using their high estimate – which assumes that all impacts of
health are as positive as any microeconomic study could suggest – the increase in GDP per
capita is 25 percent and the full long-run eﬀect is achieved within 40 years.
In terms of equation (4), supposing that the 15 percent long-run eﬀect is all captured by
6
By setting ∆ = ∆ = 0 in equation (3), it can be verified that their  measures the long-run (e.g., 40
or 60 years) impact of life expectancy on GDP per capita, exactly as does the parameter  in our equation (1).

5

, this would imply a value of  equal to 0.343, while a 25 percent long-run eﬀect implies that
 equals 0.54.7 We use  = 03, 04, 05, and 06 to span a range for the upper bound for
the eﬀects of increased life expectancy on future growth. The estimate of 0.6, in particular,
represents the strongest possible case for the BCF hypothesis.
We estimate equation (4) using 2SLS in two sets of specifications. First, we estimate (4)
assuming no mean reversion, i.e., setting  = 0 (odd-numbered columns in Table 2). Second,
we estimate (4) including log GDP per capita in 1940 on the right-hand side to control for
potential convergence eﬀects in GDP per capita (even-numbered columns in Table 2). In either
case, there is no evidence of a positive coeﬃcient for .
For example, for 1940-1980, with  = 06 and log GDP per capita in 1940 included, the
coeﬃcient on change in life expectancy is −0551 (Panel A, column 8). For 1940-2000, in Panel
B of column 8, there is a significant negative coeﬃcient on change in life expectancy: −2534
with a standard error of 1042.
As shown in Table 2, every 0.1 increase in  reduces the negative eﬀect of life expectancy by
about 0.15 in absolute terms. This implies that to reach even a zero coeﬃcient on change in life
expectancy for the odd-numbered columns of Panel A (for 1940-1980 and without controlling
for GDP per capita in 1940) would require a  of around 0.9. This is far larger than anything
that can reasonably be supported using the available microeconomic evidence. To imagine a
positive eﬀect for life expectancy on GDP per capita in the other specifications in Panel A or
in Panel B (for 1940-2000) is even more far-fetched.

4

Conclusion

Estimates using 40-year or 60-year diﬀerences in AJ (2006 and 2007), which should capture any
slow-acting eﬀects of health improvements, did not show any evidence for a positive impact
of life expectancy on GDP per capita. In this note, we report three additional approaches
for assessing the potential eﬀects of initial life expectancy on subsequent changes in GDP per
capita. All these approaches confirm our main results are robust – there is no evidence that
increases in life expectancy after 1940 had a positive eﬀect on GDP per capita growth.
7

We translate between ALW’s simulation parameters and our regression coeﬃcients as follows. A 15 percent
increase in GDP per capita means the level of GDP per capita ends up at 1.15 (i.e., if it starts at 1), so the
impact measured in natural logarithms is ln(1.15) = 0.139. Initial life expectancy is 40 years and ln(40) = 3.69.
Final life expectancy is 60 years and ln(60) = 4.09. The change in log life expectancy is 0.405. Assuming that
all of this is accounted for by  gives an upper bound for  equal to (0.139/0.405) = 0.343 in the base case.

Online Appendix
In the text, we explained how BCF’s equation (3) is used to motivate their argument that
there is a potential impact from the initial level of life expectancy on future growth. In
this Appendix, we report estimates from equation (3) using nonlinear GMM, with moment
restrictions corresponding to using past values of predicted mortality and life expectancy in
1900 as instruments – as in Arellano and Bond’s GMM, reported in Table 1. The results of
this estimation are provided in Appendix Table A1.
The two columns of this table correspond to alternative moment restrictions, with Panels
A and B again showing results for the periods 1940-1980 and 1940-2000 respectively. Column
1 reports results using a sparse set of moments (at most two lags of predicted mortality and
GDP per capita). Column 2, in the same spirit as Arellano and Bond’s full GMM, uses all lags
of predicted mortality and twice or more lagged GDP per capita.
The results are very close to the baseline estimates in AJ (2006, 2007). In the first column
for 1940-1980 (Panel A), we have ̂ = −1261, with a standard error of 0.801; and for 1940-2000
(Panel B), we have a more precisely estimated ̂ = −1548 with a standard error of 0.644. The
results in column 2 are similar, with the Panel B results showing larger (i.e., more negative),
more precise, and more statistically significant estimates.
The similarity of these results to our baseline estimates can be seen by noting that, as
pointed out in footnote 6 in the text,  in this specification corresponds precisely to the
parameter  in our equation (1), which measures the impact over a 40 or 60 year horizon.
This can be verified by setting ∆ = ∆ = 0 in equation (3) – so that the dynamics have
worked themselves out – in which case the equation implies  =  . Therefore, estimates
of  can be directly compared to the estimates in Table 9 of AJ (2007), which range from -1.21
to -2.70.
In short, nonlinear estimation using BCF’s own specification produces estimates within the
range of our baseline results.

Note. Two-Stage Least Squares specifications (columns 1, 2, 3, and 4) include a full set of country
and year fixed effects. Columns 2, 3, 4, and 5 include a full set of year dummies interacted with life
expectancy in 1900. Regressions in column 3 also include a full set of year dummies interacted with
the log of GDP per capita in 1940. Arellano and Bond's GMM estimator (column 5) removes country
fixed effects by taking first differences (hence the lower number of time periods), and then
constructs moment conditions using all predetermined lags of GDP per capita and predicted
mortality as instruments. It is estimated in two steps and thus is optimally weighted. Robust
standard errors corrected for arbitrary serial correlation (clustered) at the country level are reported
in columns 1, 2, 3 and 4, and robust standard errors are reported in column 5. Panel A contains
estimates using a balanced panel of 47 countries from 1940 to 1980. Panel B contains estimates
using a balanced panel of the same 47 countries from 1940 to 2000. See Acemoglu and Johnson
(2007) for the construction of the predicted mortality instrument, definitions, and data sources.

Note. Optimally weighted two-step GMM estimates of the model in
equation (3) from the text. Robust standard errors are in parentheses.
In column 1, the second lag of GDP per capita and the first and
second lags of predicted mortality are used as instruments for every
year. In column 2, the second and all longer lags of GDP per capita,
and the first and all longer lags of predicted mortality are used as
instruments for every year. All models include a full set of year
dummies which are also used as instruments. Panel A contains
estimates using a balanced panel of 47 countries from 1940 to 1980.
Panel B contains estimates using a balanced panel of the same 47
countries from 1940 to 2000. See Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) for
the construction of the predicted mortality instrument, definitions, and
data sources.
