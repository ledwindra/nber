How Consumers Respond to Environmental Certification and the Value of Energy Information

JEL No. D12,D83,L15,Q41,Q50
ABSTRACT
The ENERGY STAR certification is a voluntary labeling that favors the adoption of energy efficient
products. In the US appliance market, the label is a coarse summary of otherwise readily accessible
information. Using micro-data of the US refrigerator market, I develop a structural demand model
and find that consumers respond to certification in different ways. Some consumers have a large willingness
to pay for the label, well beyond the energy savings associated with certified products; others appear
to pay attention to electricity costs, but not to the certification, and still others appear to be insensitive
to both electricity costs and ENERGY STAR. The findings suggest that the certification acts as a substitute
for more accurate, but complex energy information. Using the structural model, I find that the opportunity
cost of having imperfectly informed consumers in the refrigerator market ranges from $12 to $17 per
refrigerator sold.

1. Introduction
The role of certification programs is to address informational market failures, and ultimately help
consumers in distinguishing high-quality products from lemons (Akerlof 1970; Viscusi 1978). Theoretical analyses have shown that the welfare effects of certification programs depend on a confluence of factors such as market structure, heterogeneity in consumer preferences, and consumer
sophistication (Dranove and Jin 2010). When certification programs come with labeling schemes,
the information content of labels may also be an important determinant of welfare. Labels—like
advertisements—may affect how consumers perceive and experience goods (Bagwell 2007). Moreover, whether a label provides new information, or summarizes complex, but otherwise available
information have different welfare implications.
The goal of this paper is to show how consumers respond to ENERGY STAR (ES), a voluntary
certification program managed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The main
feature of the program consists of a simple labeling scheme (Figure 1(a)) that identifies the most
energy efficient products in the marketplace. In several markets, the program complements the
mandatory label EnergyGuide (Figure 1(b)), which provides detailed energy information. The
rationale of the ES label is to present energy efficiency as a dimension of quality that is simple,
easy to assess, and fully salient to consumers.
I propose a structural demand model that captures the various mechanisms by which the certification influences consumers. The model is inspired from classic models of consumer search and
information acquisition (e.g., Stigler 1961; McCall 1965; Gabaix et al. 2006). In the same spirit as
Sallee (2013), I use a theory of rational attention allocation (Sims 2003) to model why consumers
may rely on different pieces of energy information.
The estimation is carried on a large sample of transactions of the US refrigerator market. In
addition to rich variation in prices, electricity costs, and financial incentives for purchasing certified
products, the sample period includes two natural experiments that provide variation in labeling.
The structural model exploits this variation to recover consumer preferences for the ES label,
marginal utility of income, discount rate, and propensity to take advantage of rebates. The crucial
feature of the model is, however, to recover heterogeneity in the way consumers rely on energy

3

information. I find that some consumers rely on the certification and value the label itself well
beyond the energy savings associated with certified products, but others rely on a measure of
electricity costs and do not value the label highly. A non-negligible fraction of consumers also
appears to neither value the certification nor consider electricity costs in their purchase decisions,
and this fraction is much larger for lower income households.
The results from the structural estimation are supported by alternative estimators that account
for heterogeneity in a more flexible manner. I first show using a simple conditional logit that the
coefficients on the ES label and electricity costs are inversely correlated with several demographic
variables. In particular, richer and smaller households, where the head is older and educated
respond more to electricity costs, but not so much to the label. Using an approach proposed by
Fox et al. (2011), I recover a nonparametric join distribution of the coefficients on the ES label
and electricity costs, which also shows a clear negative correlation between the two coefficients.
Altogether, the data suggest that the certification acts as a substitute for more accurate, but
complex energy information.
These results are of primary importance for the design of energy policies that target energy
demand. Consumers’ inattention to energy efficiency is an often-cited justification for minimum
standards. Recent empirical evidence has, however, been mostly confined to the car market (e.g.,
Klier and Linn 2010; Li, Timmins and von Haefen 2009; Busse, Knittel and Zettelmeyer 2013;
Allcott and Wozny 2012), and suggests that inattention to car operating costs may in fact be
modest on average. I fill a gap in this literature by explicitly showing how existing labeling policies
in the appliance market may overcome inattention, and quantifying the value of energy information.
I find that the opportunity cost of having imperfectly informed consumers in the refrigerator market
ranges from $12 to $17 per refrigerator sold, or $108M/year to $153M/year for the whole market.
These latter estimates are more than twice larger the overall program cost of the ES program.
Surprisingly, although ecolabels have become ubiquitous in marketplaces, empirical analyses
of such policies have remained scarce (Mason 2013). The structural model contributes to the
theoretical work on the topic by developing and testing a theory of how consumers respond to

4

environmental certification. It also provides the first estimates of the behavioral effects of the ES
program using a revealed preference approach combined with market-level data.1
More broadly, this paper contributes to the literature on information-based policies. Arguably,
the complexity and economic significance of the appliance purchasing decision pale by comparison
to other decisions such as retirement savings, health care plan, nutrition, and school enrollment.
In these settings, it is also customary to provide coarse summaries of complex information, by way
of grades, rankings, and score cards, for instance. My framework and empirical strategy could be
applied to these contexts, and complement other structural estimators (e.g., Abaluck and Gruber
2011; Abaluck 2011; Handel and Kolstad 2013) that aim to explicitly deal with attention allocation
and heuristics used in complex choice environments.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a primer on energy
labels for the US appliance market. Section 3 presents a theory of how consumers respond to the
ES certification. Section 4 gives an overview of the data, and discusses sources of identification.
Section 5 provides preliminary estimates using a simple conditional logit model. Section 6 proceeds
to the estimation of the structural model, and section 7 provides an alternative estimator that
recovers heterogeneity in the valuation of energy efficiency with minimal structure. The policy
analysis is presented in section 8, and conclusions follow.

2. A Primer on Energy Labels for the Appliance Market
In the US appliance market, two different labeling schemes offer energy information to consumers.
The EnergyGuide program was established in 1979, and is managed by the Federal Trade Commission. The program covers most types of appliances, and several consumer electronics. The
main feature of the program is the requirement that all products offered in the marketplace display
prominently a large yellow label with detailed technical information about energy consumption and
costs. The content of the EnergyGuide label was revised several times since the inception of the
program. In its most recent version (Figure 1(b)), the label displays the annual electricity (or gas)
1

Ward et al. (2011) used an online survey to elicit consumers’ willingness to pay for the ES label, and found a
positive and significant impact of the label on hypothetical decisions. Recently, Newell and Siikamäki (2013)
use an online survey with hypothetical choices and also found that the label has a large impact on choices.

5

consumption of the product, an estimate of the annual operating cost based on the national average
price of energy, and a scale with a cost range of similar products.
ENERGY STAR was established in 1992 by the EPA as a way to complement EnergyGuide.
The ES label contains no technical information, and is similar to a simple brand logo (Figure 1(a)).
Only products that meet a certain certification have the right to display the label. For certified
appliances, the label is often displayed on the product itself, and on the EnergyGuide label.
Historically, the certification requirement for appliances has been binary.2 Under this system,
the requirement is defined relative to the federal minimum energy efficiency standard. For instance,
since April 2008, a full-size refrigerator can be certified if it consumes at least 20% less electricity
than the minimum energy efficiency standard established for this refrigerator model. Because
minimum standards vary as a function of the appliance size, and other attributes, the certification
requirement does not fix electricity consumption to an absolute level. It is common to find small
uncertified appliances that consume less than larger certified appliances.
A crucial feature of the program is that the certification requirements are revised periodically.
The EPA revises the stringency of a requirement using various criteria, such as the proportion of
certified products offered on the market, the market shares, and the availability of new technologies
(McWhinney et al. 2005). The stringency of a requirement is ultimately determined by the EPA
upon consultation with different stakeholders, such as manufacturers, part providers, retailers,
analysts, and environmental groups. The EPA usually announces a revision one year in advance.
An important institutional feature of the US electricity market is that several electric utilities are
subject to regulations that incentivize them to promote energy efficiency measures to consumers.
Rebate programs tied to the purchase of ES products have been arguably one of the most popular energy efficiency measures pursued by US electric utilities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005
also established a state rebate program for appliances tied to the ES certification. In 2010-2011,
this program was temporarily funded with stimulus funds. Thus, apart from the informational
component, financial incentives may play a role in favoring the adoption of certified products.
2

Since 2011, the EPA has been experimenting with a multiple tiers system in some product categories. The
present paper focuses on the binary system.

3. An Information Acquisition Model for Energy-Intensive Durables
In the context of purchasing an appliance, evaluating the energy cost of each product is arguably a
complex and costly task. It requires taking the time to look at the EnergyGuide label, understand
the various pieces of information, look up the local electricity prices, and perform mental calculations. A priori, knowledge about the energy cost of each product j, Cj , is then consider imperfect.
A consumer i can learn the value of Cj only by incurring a cost Ki (ei ), where ei represents the
effort to collect and process energy information. Define I(ei ) as the consumer’s knowledge about
energy costs for a given level of effort, the expected energy cost of product j at the time of purchase
is then defined by: E[Cj |I(ei )].
In addition of the expected energy cost, consumer i values product j as a function of its quality (δj ), price (Pj ), whether a product is ES certified or not (Dj ), rebate amount (R), and an
idiosyncratic taste parameter (ij ):
(1)

Uij = δj − ηPj − θE[Cj |I(ei )] + τ Dj + ψDj × R + ij ,

where the coefficients: η, θ, τ , and ψ all relate to structural demand parameters. The coefficient
on prices (η) corresponds to the marginal utility of income, and the ratio of the coefficient on the
ES dummy (τ ) and the marginal utility of income (τ /η) corresponds to the marginal willingness
to pay for the label itself. If we were able to observe whether a consumer claimed a rebate R, and
there were no hassle costs associated with claiming a rebate, the coefficient on rebates would match
the coefficient on prices, i.e., would be equal to the marginal utility of income. These conditions
do not hold in the present application. The coefficient on rebates (ψ) should then be interpreted
as an intent to treat estimator (Imbens and Angrist 1994) corresponding to the marginal utility of
income multiplied by the probability that a consumer takes advantage of a rebate program. Finally,
comparing the coefficient on electricity costs (θ) with the coefficient on prices informs about the
extent that consumers trade off future electricity costs with the purchase price. Assuming that
consumers form time-unvarying expectations about annual electricity costs, and do not account for
the effect of depreciation, the coefficient on electricity costs is then a reduced form parameter that

7

relates to the discount factor as follows:3
θ=η

(2)

1 − ρL
,
1−ρ

where L is the lifetime of the durable, and ρ = 1/(1 + r) is the discount factor. The estimates of η
and θ can then be used to infer a value of an implicit discount rate r.
A consumer’s purchasing decision is modeled as a two-step process. To begin, a consumer is
uncertain about energy costs, the meaning of the certification (noted S), and whether a product is
certified or not.4 A consumers observes the quality and the price for each appliance and then decides
the amount of effort to collect and process energy information. I assume that choosing the effort
level is a discrete choice with three possible outcomes. A consumer may collect and processes enough
information to form accurate expectations about the energy costs associated with each option, and
thus make a purchase decision perfectly informed (noted e = I). In this case, E[Cj |I(ei = I)] = Cj ,
where Cj is an accurate forecast of the energy costs of product j. Alternatively, a consumer may
only collect information related to the certification (noted e = ES). He will then learn the true
meaning of the certification and which products are certified, but not the exact energy costs of
each option. The expected energy costs are then: E[Cj |I(ei = ES)] = E[Cj (s)|Dj ], where s
corresponds to the certification requirement.5 Finally, a consumer may decide to not update his
3Under

these assumptions, the lifetime energy costs (LCj ) over the lifetime of the durable are given by:

can be interpreted as a small psychological cost to detect whether or not a product has the ES label.
a consumer were to know the meaning of the ES certification, he would then know that the energy costs of
certified products are below a particular threshold corresponding to the ES standard. Denote this threshold
by S. If the consumer does not collect information, his belief about the meaning of S is given by a prior
distribution G. If the consumer learns the meaning of the certification, he observes a realization s from G.
If the prior on energy costs is given by the distribution F , the expected energy cost for a certified product
j is then:
Z s

E[Cj (s)|Dj = 1] = E[Cj |Cj ≤ s] =
cf (c)dc,
F (s) c
where c is the lower bound of the support of F , and . Similarly, the expected energy costs for a non-certified
product j 0 is: Similarly, the expected energy costs for non-certified models are:

E[Cj 0 (s)|Dj = 0] = E[Cj 0 |Cj 0 > s] =

where c is the higher bound of the support of F .
5If

8

priors and remain uncertain about energy costs, the meaning of the certification, and whether a
product is certified or not (noted e = U ). In this case, prior beliefs are uninformative, i.e., all
options in the choice set have the same expected energy cost ex ante: E[Cj |I(ei = U )] = C̄. In a
discrete choice framework, it is as if the consumer dismisses energy costs altogether.
Prior to making a purchase, the consumer’s effort to collect and process information is given by
the following optimization problem:

j

When consumers are heterogeneous with respect to the costs of collecting and processing energy
information, a fraction of the population will rely on energy costs, another on the ES certification,
and others will dismiss the energy efficiency attribute.
In this framework, the certification influences consumers via three mechanisms. First, it can be
used as a heuristic to compare products in a binary manner along the energy dimension, and thus
partly informs about energy costs. In particular, if consumers rely on ES, instead of an accurate
forecast of energy cost, they would value certified products more based on their expected energy
savings: E[Cj (s)|Dj = 1] − E[Cj 0 (s)|Dj = 0]. According to this mechanism, the certification
thus brings welfare gains because it allows consumers to economize on information costs while still
bringing some information about energy efficiency.6
A second mechanism is the effect of the label itself. That is, consumers might value certified
products beyond purely their expected energy savings, and value the exact same appliance with and
without the label differently. There are a number of reasons that can explain why the label might
have such effect. ES products are often advertised as being environmentally friendly. Consumers
might thus derive warm glow to purchase certified products, respond to social norms, or experience
social prestige. Under this interpretation, the label impacts how consumers experience the product,
and provides a positive utility shock. It is also possible that consumers correlate certified products
with better quality, and are subject to what marketeers refer to the halo effect (Boatwright, Kalra,
6Consumers

at the source of the welfare gains are the ones that would not consider energy efficiency if
the certification were not in effect, but rely on the ENERGY STAR label when it is present. Note that a
consumer should always choose to be fully informed if there are no extra costs to doing so, i.e., a consumer
is better off with more information. A formal proof of this argument can be found in Appendix A.

9

and Zhang 2008). In this case, the certification provides an illusion of higher quality, and biases
consumers. Empirically, these explanations are hard to disentangle, but they are important to
recognize as they have different welfare implications.
The third mechanism is simply the effect of rebates, which provide an explicit financial motivation to adopt ES products.

4. Data and Preliminary Evidence
The primary data used for the estimation consist of all transactions made at a large US appliance
retailer during the period 2007-2011 where a full-size refrigerator was bought. The retailer offers a
large selection of appliance models, and has at least one brick-and-mortar store in each US state
in addition to a national online store. For each transaction, I observe the date, the model of the
refrigerator, attributes, the suggested retail price, the promotional price, the wholesale price, the
taxes paid, and the zipcode of the store where the transaction was made. For a large subset of
transactions, I also observe consumer demographics, such as household size, income, education,
homeownership, housing type, political orientation, and age of the head of the household. This
demographic information is transaction specific.
The estimation focuses on refrigerators for three reasons. First, during this period, there were
two events that led to the decertification of ES refrigerators. As it is further explained below, these
events provide natural experiments that identify the effect of the label. Second, refrigerators are
one of the few energy intensive durables for which utilization behavior has little impact on energy
consumption. Operating costs can then be estimated accurately using engineering information
and electricity prices. When utilization is unobserved, this creates a measurement error problem
(Allcott and Wozny 2012), and can be at the source of a selection bias (Bento, Li and Roth 2012). In
the present application, I can credibly rule out utilization as a source of unobserved heterogeneity,
which has important implications on how to interpret the results. Finally, a third reason is that this
market is representative of other appliance markets in terms of market structure and public policies
it is subject to. The structural demand parameters can then be applied to a broader context.

10

The construction of the key variables used in the estimation, and their main sources of variation
are discussed next.

4.1. ENERGY STAR Certification
When a new certification requirement comes into effect, the EPA requires that manufacturers and
retailers remove the ES label on certified products that do not meet the more stringent requirement.
For products that display the ES logo on the EnergyGuide label, firms are also required to clearly
identify that these products are decertified by masking the logo. Using data that cover the period
before and after the revision in the standard, it is then possible to observe the same refrigerator
model being sold at the same store, with and without the ES label. I can thus exploit this variation
in labeling to identify how consumers value the ES label, while controlling for all other product
attributes.
The last revision of the ES certification requirement for full-size refrigerators came into effect
on April 28, 2008, and was announced exactly one year in advance by the EPA. Prior this revision,
ES refrigerators had to consume at least 15% less electricity than the minimum energy efficiency
standard; the revision set the stringency at 20%.
For the year 2008, there were 2,524 refrigerator models available in the whole US market and
1,278 models lost their certification (Table 1). In the sample, there are 1,483 models for that year,
with 674 models that were decertified. The large number of decertified models provides good power
for identification, and more importantly covers all product classes. This decertification event thus
allows us to elicit preferences for all segments of the population, but it brings two challenges.
First, manufacturers and retailers adjust to the revision in certification by introducing new
models, and removing decertified models. This is illustrated on Figure 2, which plots the location
of all the models offered for particular types of full-size refrigerators, with respect to the minimum
and ES standards. The two standards are depicted by the straight lines as a function of the
refrigerator size. Each dot represents a refrigerator model offered in a given year. There are two
important stylized facts. First, there is strong bunching at the standards. Firms thus believe
that consumers value the certification, and make product line decisions accordingly. Second, firms
can adjust their product lines quickly. In the same year that the revision was announced, models

11

just meeting the new certification entered the market. Following the revision, a large number of
decertified models also exited the market.
If left unaccounted for, product exit would confound the effect of the change in labelling. To
control for the effects of product entry and exit, I construct an unbalanced panel of refrigerator
models offered on the market. In particular, for each refrigerator model, I identify the first and
last month for which a model was sold at least once in a specific store. I assume that consumers
shopping at this store between these two months could purchase this particular refrigerator model.7
Under these assumptions, the choice set imputed for each consumer consists of refrigerator models
that were physically present in the store at the time of purchase.
The second challenge in using this large decertification event is that I do not observe the exact
date that the ES label was removed or masked on each product. Although, the retailer’s policy
is to coordinate the change in labeling across all stores, and to implement the change close to the
date mandated by the EPA, I cannot ensure that all store managers complied with the policy at
an exact date. The estimation is performed under the assumption that all refrigerators that were
decertified in 2008 lost their ES label on the last week of April 2008.
As a robustness test, I exploit a second decertification event that overcomes these issues. In
January 2010, the EPA announced that 21 refrigerator models were subject to an incorrect testing
procedure, which resulted in the underestimation of their electricity consumption. The revised test
confirmed that these models did not meet the certification requirement, and should be decertified.
The sample contains 14 of these models. Unlike the 2008 revision, this event came as a surprise
for manufacturers and retailers. The EPA also mandated to print new EnergyGuide labels printed,
and to diligently remove all references to ES after the public announcement on January 20, 2010.
This event is thus appealing because it provides a sharp discontinuity in labelling, and rules out
the effect of anticipation by the firms. One caveat is that the prices of these decertified models are
higher that the average price (Table 1). Therefore, if different consumers sort into product classes
7Excluding

the first and last month of the panel is a conservative assumption. This ensures that months
were a stockout happened at the end or beginning of the month are discarded. Note that using store specific
choice sets is also a conservative assumption given that the retailer can deliver appliances available at nearby
stores.

12

with expensive models, the behavioral response to this event might not be representative of the
whole market.

4.2. Prices
The retailer implements promotions primarily at the national level due to a national price policy.
Each refrigerator model is subject to large and frequent variations in prices. This high frequency
temporal variation in retail prices is exploited to identify consumers’ sensitivity to prices. Prices are
imputed from the transaction level data. Weekly and store-specific price time series are constructed
for each model, and the average tax rate is computed for each store and trimester.
Figure 3 plots the percentage change of average weekly prices relative to the suggested manufacturer retail price (a measure of promotion) together with the percentage change in weekly sales
relative to average weekly sales for each refrigerator model in the sample. Figure 3 suggests that
most of the promotions consist of price reductions between 5% and 25%, and that correlation between sales and prices is negative and relatively large. The figure also suggests a change in the
pricing strategy over time. In 2008, promotions tend to be more idiosyncratic, while in 2010 promotions are clustered at rounded percentages (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%). The average duration of
a promotion also increases from 2008 to 2010, from 1.4 week to 3.1 week (Table 1).
Figure 4 shows the weekly average normalized price for different classes of refrigerators.8 Around
the time of the revision in April 2008, there is no significant change in prices for decertified models
relative to models that were never certified, or met the more stringent requirement (i.e., models
that were certified before and after April 2008). Post-decertification, prices of decertified models
dip below other models by about 1% to 2%, but otherwise follows a similar trend. For 2010, the
story is different. The price of decertified models drop sharply just after the announcement by as
much of 15%.
8The

weekly average normalized price for different classes of refrigerators is computed as follows. First,
the normalized price for each refrigerator model is obtained by taking the weekly retail price divided by its
average weekly price. The average normalized price and standard errors in each efficiency class are then
computed by fitting a cubic spline on normalized prices.

13

4.3. Electricity Prices
The electricity cost of each refrigerator model is the yearly electricity consumption reported by
the manufacturer multiplied by the average electricity price of the region where each household
lives.9 I assume that consumers form time-unvarying expectations about electricity prices using
the current local average price. The time-unvarying assumption is consistent with recent evidence
in the car market suggesting that consumers’ best forecasts of future gasoline prices are simply the
current prices (Anderson et al. 2011). Note also that electricity prices tend to vary much less over
time than gasoline prices. For instance, between 2008 and 2010, the national average electricity
price remained virtually unchanged (Table 1). Whether consumers respond to marginal or average
electricity prices, and the appropriate level of spatial aggregation to compute average electricity
prices is open to discussions. Ito (2012) shows that consumers respond to variations in average
electricity prices within California, which suggests that fairly local average electricity prices is the
most appropriate measure. Most online tools provides by the US EPA and retailers to estimate
energy costs and savings associated with ES, however, rely on a state average. In the estimation,
I compute average electricity prices using two different levels of aggregation, namely at the state
and county level.
Average electricity prices are computed using the EIA-861 form of the Energy Information
Administration (EIA 2008), which provides total revenue and sales to residential consumers for
each utility operating in the US. Further assumptions and methodology to construct the average
electricity prices are described in Appendix B.
The main source of identification of the coefficient on electricity costs comes from the fact
that I observe the same refrigerator models being sold at stores located in different electric utility
territories. This allows me to control for product and region fixed effects and use cross-sectional
variation in average electricity prices across regions to identify the sensitivity to electricity prices.
9I

do not observe the zipcode of each household, but the zipcode of the store where each transaction was
made. Each household’s location is imputed from the zipcode where the purchase was made.

14

4.4. Rebates
In the US, several electric utilities offer rebate programs to encourage the adoption of energy
efficient appliances. These rebate programs are all similar in nature. Consumers claim the rebates
by filling out a form that must be submitted by mail or online. The purchased refrigerator must
meet a given energy efficiency criterion, which for most programs consists of the ES certification. A
complete description of these programs is available in the database of state incentives for renewable
and efficiency (IREC 2011). The number of active rebate programs and the amount offered by each
program vary over time. In 2008, 87 utilities offered a rebate program for ES refrigerators, and this
number increased to 133 in 2010 (Table 1).
In addition to utility rebate programs, state governments also offered financial incentives for ES
appliances during the sample period. In 2010, as part of the stimulus effort, the federal government
allocated funds to all US states and territories to establish temporary rebate programs to encourage
the adoption of energy efficient products. Each state had sovereignty over the design of its rebate
program, which led to important variation in the rebate amount across regions and time. During
the 2010-2011 period, 44 states offered rebates for refrigerators. The average rebate amount was
$128, and varied from $50 to $600. Some programs lasted for only one day (e.g., IL and TX); the
longest running program was in Alaska and lasted 639 days (Aldy and Houde 2013).
In the estimation, the rebate amount offered to each consumer is the average rebate amount in
each county, which includes the utility and state rebates, when both are available. Utility rebates
vary across county and years, while state rebates have weekly variation.

5. The Average Consumer
The goal of this section is to characterize the preferences of the average consumer in the US
refrigerator market, and discuss the sources of variation used for identification.
The empirical strategy relies on a simple discrete choice model. Consumer i living in region r
at time t derives utility Uijrt from purchasing refrigerator model j:
(4)

Uijrt = τ Djt − ηPjrt + ψRrt × Djt − θCjrt + δj + ijrt ,

15

where Djt is a dummy variable that takes the value one if product j is certified at time t and zero
otherwise. The variable Cjrt is the annual electricity cost of product j sold in region r. Pjrt is the
retail price, which includes all the local sales taxes, and Rrt is the rebate amount offered in region
r. The variables γj , and ijrt denote respectively the product fixed effects, and the idiosyncratic
taste parameters.
The idiosyncratic taste parameters are i.i.d. and Type I extreme value distributed, which yields
closed-form expressions for the choice probabilities. The choice probabilities do not include an
outside option (no purchase or purchase at other stores) because the policy analysis focuses on
how energy information influences which product to purchase, not the timing of the decision. The
model is estimated by maximum likelihood, where the likelihood is constructed with the choice
probabilities of a large sub-sample of consumers. The sub-sample is taken from the transactions
that contain demographic information. I also only consider transactions made by homeowners
living in single family housing units that bought no more than one refrigerator in any given year.
This restricted set of transactions is then likely to correspond to households that have to pay for
their electricity bills. The sample thus rules out heterogeneity in the sensitivity to energy costs
due to the split incentive problem (Blumstein et al. 1980), i.e., the fact that some consumers of
energy-intensive durables do not pay for energy costs.
For the estimation, I treat the two decertification events distinctly. Moreover, because the
rebate programs offered as part of the stimulus effort are in nature different from the programs
offered by utilities, rebate amounts offered in 2010-2011 may have a different effect than rebates
offered in prior years. The estimation is therefore carried on two separate sub-samples. The first
sub-sample is taken from transactions close to the 2008 revision. Namely, only transactions from
January 2008 to December 2008 are considered.10 An additional rationale to consider a restricted
sample centered around April 2008 is to control for product exit. The second sub-sample is taken
from all transactions made between January 2009 and December 2011. This covers the second
decertification event and a period with more variation in rebates.
10Transactions

for the whole month of September 2008 and prior to January 2008 do not include demographic
information. They are then excluded from the sample for the structural estimation. Data for the year 2007
are used for robustness tests presented in the Online Appendix C.

5.1. Results
Table 2 presents the estimates obtained with various specifications of the conditional logit. For all
models, robust standard errors clustered at the store level are reported. The first three models are
estimated using the sub-sample covering the year 2008. Model 1 is the simplest and only controls
for product fixed effects. The coefficient on price is negative, relatively large, and significant.
The own-price elasticity evaluated at the mean price ($1300) is -5.47. This is large, but not
surprising. Each refrigerator model has several close substitutes, and manufacturers and retailers
offer generous promotions. Consumers can then easily substitute across models to take advantage
of the promotions.
The effect of the ES label is positive and statistically significant. This translates into a willingness
to pay for the label of $19, or about 1.5% of the purchase price, on average.
The coefficient on electricity costs is negative and significant. This suggests that consumers do
respond to information about electricity costs, on average. Assuming a lifetime of 18 years, the
implicit discount rate is 62%. This is on par with previous estimates for refrigerators that range
from 35% to more than 60% (Meier and Whittier 1983). To put these numbers in perspective, in its
latest cost-benefit analysis of minimum energy efficiency standards for refrigerators, the Department
of Energy (DOE) used a product lifetime of 19 years, and discount rates of 3% and 7% (DOE 2011).
The impact of ES rebates is positive, small, and not statistically significant. As explained earlier,
the coefficient on rebates should be interpreted as the marginal utility of income multiplied by the
probability that a consumer takes advantage of the rebate. For the present estimates of η and ψ,
the implied probability of taking a rebate is below 1.0%. The fact that the sub-sample covers the
year 2008 implies that only cross-sectional variation in utility rebates is exploited. This limited
source of variation combined with measurement error associated with using average rebate at the
county level may lead to an attenuation bias.

5.2. Other Specifications
Weekly variation in prices is exploited to identify the price coefficient. It can be argued that this
variation is in part exogenous to demand shocks due to some institutional details of the appliance

17

market. In this market, manufacturers set high MSRPs, and let retailers offer promotions. To
comply with antitrust laws, retailers, however, do not offer products in constant discount, and
cycle promotions across similar products. This pricing strategy provides idiosyncratic variation to
identify the coefficient on prices. At specific time of the year, the retailer, however, often offer
generous promotions for specific brands. Model 2 thus includes brand-week fixed effects to account
for marketing efforts correlated with promotions. This has few impact on the coefficient on prices,
and other coefficients as well, suggesting that the marketing effects are not a major source of bias.
The construction of the electricity operating costs relies on the assumptions that consumers do
not forecast future electricity prices, and use local average prices. The lack of variation in electricity
prices over time makes the first assumption uncontroversial. The second assumption may imply a
degree of sophistication that not all consumers might have. Measurement error in electricity prices
is therefore a concern. In the car market, Allcott and Wozny (2012) shows that measurement
error in car operating costs is an important source of bias. An important difference in the present
context is that the source of measurement error is not due to the unobserved utilization decision,
but due to not knowing which electricity price consumers rely on when making decision. Model 3
reports results where the average state electricity price is used, instead of a county average. The
magnitude of the coefficient on electricity costs increases (in absolute value), which suggests that
measurement error does have an effect. In this specification, the implicit discount rate is 32%,
about twice smaller than in the previous specifications. Using county average electricity prices thus
provides a conservative estimate of the average valuation of energy efficiency.
Because variation in electricity prices is primarily cross-sectional, a concern is that consumers
living in regions subject to higher electricity prices are systematically different than others. The
Online Appendix C contains additional specifications to control for region specific unobservables.
Count models that include brand-week fixed effects, product fixed effects, and store fixed effects are
presented. For all specifications, the coefficient on electricity prices remain negative and significant.
Model 4 is a conditional logit with product fixed effects estimated on data covering the period
2009-2011. This provides an alternative estimate of the effect of the ES label exploiting the 2010
decertification event. As discussed before, this decertification was unexpected by firms, ruling out
the possible confounding effect of product entry and exit associated with the 2008 revision. The

18

coefficient for the ES label is now more than twice larger than the coefficient obtained for the 2008
revision. The larger estimate can be explained in part by the fact the decertified models were
expensive, and thus captures preferences of affluent households that might have a high willingness
to pay for certified products. This previews the results of the next section, which show that the
willingness to pay for ES increases with income. Model 5 is similar to Model 4, except that it
uses only four weeks of data following the announcement on January 20, 2010. The goal of this
specification is to show that even with a more conservative criterion to rule out the effect of firms’
product line and inventory decisions, the coefficient on ES is still large. However, the estimate is
smaller than in Model 4, and imprecisely estimated. This reassures that the change in labeling does
capture demand preferences, and the label effect is not entirely confounded by firms’ decisions.
Finally, note that for Models 4 and 5, the coefficient on rebate is positive, but still economically
small, and only marginally significant (Model 5). The implied probability of taking advantage of
a rebate varies between 9% and 14%. These results are consistent with the findings of Aldy and
Houde (2013), which suggest that most consumers that took advantage of rebates in 2010 would
have purchased an ES appliance even in the absence of a rebate program.

5.3. Interaction with Demographics
I now let the demand preferences vary as a function of demographics. Table 3 first presents
the estimates from a conditional logit estimated for three different income groups. I distinguish
between households with income of less than $50,000, households with income between $50,000
and $100,000, and households with income of more than $100,000. As expected, lower income
households have a larger coefficient on prices, which implies that the marginal utility of income is
decreasing with income. The willingness to pay for the ES label is increasing with income, but the
implicit discount rate is decreasing. Everything else being equal, lower income households respond
less to the certification and electricity costs.
Table 3 also presents the estimates from a conditional logit estimated for the three different
income groups where the ES dummy is interacted with demographics. Doing so, the coefficient
on electricity costs remains virtually unchanged. This suggests that region-specific preferences for
energy efficiency are not an important source of bias for the coefficient on electricity costs. It would

19

be particularly problematic if, for instance, consumers living in high electricity prices regions also
tended to be greener and, therefore, valued ES more. In that case, high rates of adoption of ES
products in these regions would be confounded with a response to electricity prices. Interacting
the ES dummy with demographic information (income, education, political orientation, age of the
head of the household, and family size) provides a simple way to show that a positive correlation in
the preferences for the certification and electricity costs does not mechanically drive the behavioral
response to electricity costs.
In Table 4, both the coefficients on the ES dummy and electricity costs are interacted with
demographics. First note that within each income group, income is still an important source
of heterogeneity11 for the ES coefficient, except for the highest income group. Within the low
and medium income groups, the coefficient on ES increases with income. This suggests that the
willingness to pay for ES increases steadily with income until it reaches a certain threshold. The
coefficient on electricity costs increases with income within the low and medium income groups.
Here, a larger and positive coefficient implies that consumers value future electricity costs less (i.e.,
higher implicit discount rate). For these two income groups, there is then an inverse correlation
between the willingness to pay for the ES label and lower electricity costs.
The effect of education varies between income groups. For the two highest income groups,
households where the head has a graduate degree tend to respond more to electricity costs relative
to less educated households. On the other hand, these households do not value the ES label much
more. For the lowest income group, this is the inverse pattern. It thus appears that more affluent
and educated households might be sophisticated enough to consider electricity costs, and by doing
so they do not see extra value in the ES label.
The most important source of heterogeneity for the coefficient on electricity costs is, however,
the age of the head of the household. Older households respond more to electricity costs, and this
holds across the three income groups. The coefficient on ES has no clear correlation with age, and
the effects are marginally significant.
11Income

is measured with a categorical variable taking nine values. Each sub-sample corresponding to a
particular income group contains three income groups.

20

The size of the household matters, especially for the first two income groups. Larger families
value ES more, but respond less to electricity costs.
Finally, political orientation impacts mostly preferences for ES. Perhaps surprisingly, relative to
Republicans, households registered as Democrats or other political parties (including non-registered
households) have a lower willingness to pay for the label.
The Online Appendix C presents an additional model where the coefficient on prices is also
interacted with demographic information. Under this specification, the patterns discussed above
still hold.

5.4. Discussion
The aforementioned estimates suggest that both the ES certification and information about electricity costs impact consumers, on average. The sign and the magnitude of the coefficients for
the ES label and electricity costs are robust to several specifications. Measurement error in average electricity prices has however a relatively large impact on the coefficient on electricity costs.
Overall, consumers, at least some, appear to rely on different pieces of energy information when
purchasing an appliance.
Interactions with demographics information yield interesting heterogeneity patterns. The most
important finding is that the coefficients on ES and electricity costs are inversely correlated for most
demographic variables. This implies that classes of consumers that value ES highly tend to respond
less to electricity costs, and vice versa. Richer households of a smaller size, where the head is older
and educated respond more to electricity costs. This suggests that these households might be the
most sophisticated–enough to rely on the EnergyGuide and more detailed energy information. The
structural model, presented next, explicitly tests this hypothesis, and yields results consistent with
these patterns.

6. Estimation: Information Acquisition Model
To obtain an econometric specification of the information acquisition model, I maintain the assumption that the idiosyncratic taste parameters () are extreme value distributed. In addition, I

21

assume that the information acquisition costs have an unobservable idiosyncratic component, νie ,
that is also Type I extreme value distributed. For a level of effort, e, the cost for consumer i is
given by:
Ki (e) = K e + β e Xi + νie ,

(5)

where Xi is a vector of demographics, and the constant K e and the vector β e are coefficients to be
estimated.
The choice model takes the following general form:
Qirt (j) =

(6)

X

e
Hirt (e)Pirt
(j),

e={U,ES,I}
e (j) are the product choice probabilities
where Hirt (e) are the effort choice probabilities, and Pirt
e (j) for each level of effort
conditional on e. The alternative-specific utilities, Uijrt , that enter Pirt

are:
e=I:

I
Uijrt
= −ηPjrt + ψRrt × Djt + τ I Djt − θCjr + δj + Iijrt

ES
e=ES: Uijrt
= −ηPjrt + ψRrt × Djt + τ ES Djt − θESAV IN GSrt × Djt + δj + ES
ijrt

e=U:

U
Uijrt
= −ηPjrt + γj + U
ijrt .

When e = I, consumers form a perfect forecast of the operating costs for each product in the
choice set by multiplying the annual electricity consumption of refrigerator j and the average county
electricity price in region r. When e = ES, the term ESAV IN GSrt is the difference between the
average operating costs of ES and non-ES refrigerators, in region r at time t. The effect of the label
is included for both e = I and e = ES, which means that consumers can value certified models
beyond purely energy savings in both cases. The coefficient can, however, vary across types. The
effect of rebates is also included for both e = I and e = ES. If consumers are uninformed (e = U ),
they will trade-off refrigerators only with respect to prices and non-energy related attributes.
The effort choice probabilities are given by:
(7)

exp (−K e − β e Xi + E,D,S,C [maxj {Uijrt }|I(e)])
.
Hirt (e) = P

k exp (−K − β Xi + E,D,S,C [maxj {Uijrt }|I(k)])

22

Evaluating the expectation in (7) has two challenges: it requires specifying consumers’ beliefs
about electricity costs and ES, and then integrating over a multi-dimensional integral. The latter
is particularly challenging for large choice sets, as in the present application (Table 1). The former brings an identification issue given that consumers’ beliefs are not observed at the moment
they make a purchase decision. This implies that the information acquisition costs that enter the
effort choice probabilities are not identified given that their magnitude depend on how beliefs are
specified. I circumvent these two difficulties by using a flexible representation of the expectation at
different levels of effort. In particular, I approximate the expectation with variables that capture
the characteristics of the choice set faced by each consumer, and related to the decision to process
or not energy information.
As discussed by Sallee (2013), in a rational search model consumers might be inattentive to
energy efficiency if the variance in the value of other attributes is large relatively to the variance in
electricity costs. The intuition is that the ex ante value of information increases with the variance
in beliefs. Therefore, if consumers have limited resources to spend on processing information, they
should allocate attention such that learning about attributes has the highest expected returns.
With this intuition in mind, the effort choice probabilities are specified as follows:
eVirt (e)
Hirt (e) = P V (k) ,
irt
ke

where
(9)

Virt (e = I) = − K I − β I Xi + γ1I M eanElecrt + γ2I V arElecrt + γ3I N bM odelsrt

Virt (e = ES) = − K ES − β ES Xi + γ1ES M eanESrt + γ2ES V arESrt + γ3ES N bM odelsrt
+ γ4ES V arP ricert + γ5ES V arF Ert ,
Virt (e = U ) = 0.

The variables M eanElecrt and V arElecrt are the mean and variance in electricity costs for all products offered in region r at time t, M eanESrt is the proportion of ES models offered, N bM odelsrt is
the number of models in the choice set in a given region, and V arP ricert is the variance in prices.

23

Finally, V arF Ert represents the variance in quality offered in each store, which is captured by the
product fixed effects.
The estimation is carried with a two-step maximum likelihood procedure. In the first step,
the product fixed effects are recovered by estimating a simple conditional logit with no unobserved
heterogeneity. The second step estimates the information acquisition model using the product fixed
effects from the conditional logit as data. The standard errors in the second step are corrected using
the approach of Murphy and Topel (1985). To capture heterogeneity with respect to income, the
model is estimated separately for the three different income groups.

6.1. Identification
The information acquisition model is a special case of a mixed logit with three discrete latent
classes. It can also be interpreted as a sorting model, where the effort choice probabilities capture
why consumers self-select to attend to a particular piece of energy information. The information
acquisition costs are not identified because consumer beliefs are not specified. The goal of the
estimation is to identify the share of consumers that fall in each latent class, and the behavioral
parameters that enter the choice probabilities (η, θ, τ I , τ ES , and ψ). The sources of variation
used to identify the coefficients on prices, electricity costs, rebates, and electricity costs have been
discussed in Sections 4 and 5. In what follows, I discuss identification of the latent classes.
The latent classes capture unobserved heterogeneity in the valuation of energy efficiency. As it
is customary in discrete choice models, events that induce specific substitution patterns identify
heterogeneity. In the present application, the coarseness of the certification requirement versus the
continuous nature of the information related to electricity costs each yields different substitution
patterns, which allows us to classify consumers. To illustrate, consider a market with only three refrigerator models, all with the same quality, but with different levels of energy consumption. Figure
6 represents the location of each refrigerator model in the quality-energy efficiency characteristics
space, before and after the revision in the ES standards, for three types of consumers. Panels (a)
and (d) represent the location of the refrigerator models in the quality-energy cost characteristics
space for consumers that are fully informed about energy costs. For this consumer type, products
are located at a different address in the characteristics space. How market shares will vary for a

24

relative change in prices will then be a function of the distance between products due to the difference in electricity costs. Note that for this consumer type, a revision in the ES standard (Panel
(d)), represented by the line s, should not influence the substitution patterns. Panels (b) and (e)
represent the location of the same models in the quality-ES characteristics space. This corresponds
to a graphical representation of consumers that rely on the ES certification to account for the
energy efficiency attribute. These consumers perceived ES refrigerators as perfect substitutes and
the revision in the ES standard impacts this perception (Panel (e)). For this consumer type, the
Independence of the Irrelevant Alternative (IIA) hypothesis should hold within the class of products
that are certified (and with similar quality). Finally, for consumers that do not account for the
energy efficiency attribute at all (panels (c) and (f)), all products are located at the same address in
the characteristics space and are perceived as perfect substitutes. The IIA hypothesis should hold
for all products with similar quality, irrespective of their location in the energy efficiency dimension.
To summarize, the existence of consumers with different degrees of sophistication with respect
to the way they account for energy efficiency implies different latent substitution patterns. The
discrete and binary nature of the ES certification allows us to distinguish consumers that trade off
energy efficiency using the certification from consumers that use a more continuous measure, such
as an estimate of electricity costs provided by EnergyGuide. Ultimately, each consumer type is
identified by events that cause substitution between products. In the data, relative price changes
and product entry and exit are two such types of events. They are both frequent and important.
The decertification event, as illustrated above, also contributes to the identification.

6.2. Results
Table 5 presents the estimation results for each income group using the sub-sample for the year 2008.
Comparing the estimates of the coefficient on electricity costs (θ) of the information acquisition
model with the conditional logit (Table 3) shows the importance of controlling for heterogeneity
in consumer sophistication. While the conditional logit model suggests a large undervaluation of
energy efficiency, this phenomenon has a more nuanced interpretation in the information acquisition
model. For consumers that rely on electricity costs (e = I), the implicit discount rate is low and on
par with other investment decisions. Therefore, the a priori hypothesis that a share of consumers

25

behave as if they were perfectly informed holds true. In the present framework, the existence of a
so-called Energy Efficiency Gap (Jaffe and Stavins 1994) is attributable to the existence of a share
of uninformed consumers that dismiss the energy efficiency attribute altogether. This share is 65%,
41%, and 33% for the low, medium, and high income group, respectively.
With the information acquisition model, the issue of measurement error in average electricity
prices also becomes a moot point. The share of perfectly informed consumers corresponds to
consumers that are sophisticated enough to use county average electricity prices in their decision.
As long as this is the share of consumers that I am interested to identify for the policy analysis,
county averages are the appropriate level of aggregation. If I were to use a different measure of
electricity prices, such as state averages, the share of perfectly informed consumers would simply
correspond to a different type of consumers.
The share of consumers that rely primarily on ES (e = ES) increases with income. These
consumers have a high WTP for the label itself (coefficient τ m ), which ranges from $95 to $152.
This implies that some consumers value the certification well beyond the average energy savings
associated with the certification. On average, the discount value of the energy savings associated
with ES are $83 for the year 2008.12
On the other hand, consumers that are fully informed (e = I) have a low WTP for ES, and even
negative for the lower income group. This suggests that the ES certification and information about
electricity costs are substitute. For some consumers, the ES label is simply superfluous, but for
others, it is a highly valued attribute. Whether ES is a useful heuristic from a welfare standpoint
is, however, unclear. The large willingness to pay for the label itself is puzzling, and suggests that
consumers might have a biased perception of the overall quality of certified products.
Relative to the conditional logit (Table 3), the coefficients on rebate increase, are positive, and
become significant for the lower income groups. Again, this shows the importance of accounting
for heterogeneity in sophistication. Lower income households have a higher propensity to take
advantage of a rebate program, which is consistent with the idea that, relative to richer households,
they may be more willing to overcome the hassle costs of claiming a rebate.
12Assuming

that non-ES refrigerators consume 568 kWh/year and ES refrigerators consume 500 kWH/year,
a lifetime of 18 years, and an average electricity price of 0.113 $/kWh (Table 1).

26

The coefficients that enter the latent probabilities are highly consistent with the results of the
conditional logit interacted with demographics (Table 4). Again, I find that richer, but smaller
households, where the head is older and has a graduate degree are more likely to rely on electricity
costs. Age and education are also correlated positively with the probability of relying on ES.
Republicans, relative to Democrats or households that have other political orientation, are more
likely to rely on the certification. The variables that capture the choice set faced by each consumer
tend to not have a significant impact. The higher the proportion of ES models offered, the more
likely consumers are to rely on the certification.

7. Alternative Estimator: Heterogeneity
The information acquisition model introduces heterogeneity along observable and unobservable dimensions in a parsimonious, but restrictive manner. This section presents a more flexible estimator
to capture unobserved heterogeneity. In particular, I recover the nonparametric joint distribution
of the coefficients on the ES label (τ ) and electricity costs (θ) using the estimator proposed by
Fox et al. (2011) (FKRB). The estimator provides one more piece of evidence that the preference
parameters τ and θ are inversely correlated. It also shows that the information acquisition model
captures well the main patterns of unobserved heterogeneity.
The estimator works as follows. Suppose that τ has support on the [τ , τ̄ ] interval, and similarly
θ has support on [θ, θ̄]. FKRB propose to take a large but finite number of grid points on the
intervals, and treat each point as a random coefficient with an unknown frequency that needs to
be estimated. Taking all combinations of grid points, say M , I can form the choice probabilities
for each combination, m, and approximate the choice probability for each consumer i by averaging
over all the random coefficients:
(10)

Qijrt ≈

M
X

m
αm · Pijrt
(β m ),

m=1

where αm is the unknown frequency of the pair of random coefficients: β m = {τ m , θm }, and
m (β m ) is the choice probability evaluated at β m . As shown by FKRB, the fact that the dependent
Pijrt

27

variable of the model Pijrt is linearly related to the parameters αm allows us to consistently estimate
αm using inequality constrained least squares.13
For the present application, I fix η, ψ and γj at their MLE estimates (Model 1, Table 2), and
center the support of τ and θ around the MLE estimates.14 To recover a smooth joint distribution
of random parameters, I model the joint density of τ and θ as a mixture of normal basis densities
instead of point masses, as suggested by FKRB. Using the simpler estimator with point masses
produces qualitatively similar results. Additional details on the implementation can be found in
Appendix D.
Figure 5 plots the contour map of the estimated joint density of the parameters θ and τ for
different income groups. For lower income households (Figure 5(a)), two clusters are identified,
one with a relatively low valuation to energy costs and ES, and a second with a low sensitivity to
energy costs, but a high valuation of ES. For households in the second income group (Figure 5(b)),
the distribution has a similar pattern. For higher income households (Figure 5(c)), three large
clusters are identified: households with a low valuation of ES and electricity costs; a low valuation
of ES, but a high valuation of electricity costs, and a high valuation of ES and low valuation of
electricity costs. A fourth, but marginal cluster, where households have a high valuation of both
ES and electricity costs is also detected.
Altogether, the heterogeneity patterns identified are consistent with the fact that preferences
for the ES certification and a continuous measure of electricity costs are inversely correlated. Consumers that rely on a particular piece of information are less likely to rely on the other, and vice
versa. Moreover, the FKRB estimator also reveals that a discrete model with few latent classes,
as in the information acquisition model, is sufficient to capture the main sources of unobserved
heterogeneity. It also suggests that using a mixed logit model relying on an unimodal distribution
to capture unobserved heterogeneity, as it is customary in the literature, will provide a poor fit to
the data.
13This

estimator is thus appealing because of its computational simplicity. It is, however, prone to suffer
from the curse of dimensionality, and requires some subjectivity in the choice of grid points.
14The estimator is a special case of a two-step estimator. FKRB propose a bootstrap procedure to recover
the standard errors in the second step. An approach similar to Murphy and Topel (1985) can also be used
to account for the fact that some parameters that enter the choice model were estimated in the first step. In
the present application, the estimated joint distributions are presented graphically, without standard errors.

28

8. The Value of Energy Information
This section shows how consumers, firms, and society as a whole might lose, or even gain, when some
consumers rely on ES or dismiss energy efficiency altogether instead of being perfectly informed
about energy costs. In particular, I quantify the opportunity costs of imperfect energy information
in the US refrigerator market. This is a first step toward performing a welfare analysis of ES. A
complete analysis would require to compare these costs to the economies in the costs of collecting
and processing information brought by the certification. I do not quantify these economies. The
concept of opportunity cost of imperfect energy information is in itself important for policy design.
It provides an upper bound on the net benefits of better informing consumers in this market.
Formally, I define the opportunity cost of imperfect energy information as the difference between
the welfare that would be achieved if all consumers were to make a purchase perfectly informed,
versus the expected welfare that is achieved when consumers are relying on ES or dismissing energy
efficiency. The structural model can readily be used to simulate these quantities. If all consumers
e=I (j), and the expected
are perfectly informed, the choice probabilities are given by: Qirt (j) = Pirt

Consumer Surplus. According to the information acquisition model, for consumers that do not
fully process energy information, there is a discrepancy between the electricity costs they believe
they would pay and the electricity costs they effectively pay. That is, the utility they experience
differs from the utility they thought they would experience. This gap between decision and experience utility raises the question of what concept of utility should be used to measure consumer
welfare. I propose a measure of consumer surplus based on the notion of experience utility, and
make the following assumption.
Assumption 1. If e = I, decision utility equals experience utility.
Assumption 1 simply says that under perfect information consumers experience what they believed they would experience. Under this assumption, the consumer surplus is the observed component of experience utility corresponding to the perfectly informed consumers:
(13)

CSijrt =

1
(γj + τ Djt − ηPjrt + ψRrt × Djt − θCjr ) .
η

In particular, I have divided by the marginal utility of income to convert utils into dollars.15
Whether the effect of the ES label is truly experienced, and whether τ I or τ ES should be
used can be debated. A key insight from the empirical analysis is that consumers that rely on
ES value certified products well beyond purely energy savings. Whether this high willingness
to pay for the label itself reflects a behavioral bias or corresponds to preferences has important
welfare implications. If consumers are subject to a bias akin of the halo effect, i.e., wrongfully
believe that certified products are of higher quality simply because of the label, they will pay too
much for certified products. Under this interpretation, the label effect might then reduce welfare.
Empirically, τ I tend to be close to zero, and τ ES to be large. I then propose to bound the change
in consumer surplus by considering a measure that simply excludes the label effect, and a measure
that includes τ ES .
Producer Surplus. For each refrigerator model in the sample, I observe the wholesale price. I
define the producer surplus as the difference between the retail and wholesale price. This measure

that the unobserved idiosyncratic taste parameters ijrt do not appear in the consumer surplus. The
measure thus corresponds to the expected consumer surplus, because I use the fact that E [ijrt ] = 0. Also,
note that (13) should be interpreted as the expected consumer surplus over the lifetime of the refrigerator.

30

of producer surplus should be interpreted as a lower bound, because it excludes manufacturers’
profits.16
Externality Costs. To quantify the externality costs associated with the electricity generated
to operate refrigerators, I focus on the emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2 , CH4 , N2 O), sulphur
dioxide (SO2 ), and nitrous oxide (N Ox ), and use emissions factors recommended by the EPA. The
externality costs associated with each scenario are the product of the corresponding average electricity consumption purchased, the emission factors, and the damage costs of electricity generation,
where the average electricity consumption purchased is the average of the electricity consumption
of the refrigerators sold, weighted by market shares.
The dollar damages associated with carbon dioxide correspond to the recent estimates of the
social cost of carbon recommended to assess federal regulations (Greenstone, Kopits and Wolverton
2011). For sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide, I rely on the estimates used by the Department of
Energy in the cost-benefit analysis of the 2014 minimum energy efficiency standards for refrigerators
(DOE 2011), and the estimates provided by Muller and Mendhelson (2012). Table 9 presents the
emission factors and the damage costs. The results that I report use the high estimates.

8.1. Results
ENERGY STAR at 20%. In this scenario, the stringency of the ES requirement is set at 20%
below the federal minimum energy efficiency standard.17 The demand model is simulated with
the estimates of Table 5 using a random sample of 2,000 households. The electricity prices, and
rebates faced by each household are the same as in the demand estimation. The products on the
market are all refrigerator models observed in the year 2008 that were included in the demand
estimation. Figure 7(a) shows the distribution of the products with respect to energy efficiency.
Products bunch at the minimum and ES standards. There is also a large number of products that
meet the previous certification requirement (15% more efficient than the minimum). The price of
each model is the average price observed in the post-revision period (May-December 2008).
16Under

most forms of competition between upstream and downstream firms, I conjecture that the change
in profits between manufacturers and retailers are of the same sign (Bresnahan and Reiss 1985).
17A product can be certified if it consumes at least 20% less electricity than a similar model that just meet
the minimum standard.

31

Table 6 presents the estimates of the opportunity costs with respect to the various metrics that
enter welfare. The first column compares the outcomes obtained under the information acquisition
model to a model where all consumers make a purchase decision perfectly informed. These estimates
correspond to the opportunity costs of imperfect energy information under the current labeling
policies. The opportunity costs of being completely uninformed or relying solely on ES are presented
in the second and third column, respectively.
Focusing on the measure of consumer surplus that includes the label effect (τ ES ), consumers lose
$19, on average, under the information acquisition model. This estimate can be interpreted as an
upper bound on the additional costs of collecting and processing energy information that consumers
that rely on ES or dismiss energy efficiency should be ready to invest to become perfectly informed.
Put simply, this estimates suggest that consumers are willing to forgo $19, on average, to not have to
deal with energy information. The opportunity cost of being completely uninformed about energy
efficiency is larger: $28 on average for all income groups, and is the largest for the lowest income
households ($33). If all consumers were to rely on ES, the opportunity costs would be $21. This is
an improvement relative to the case where all consumers are uninformed. This conclusion, however,
only holds if the label effect is included in the consumer surplus. If excluded, the opportunity cost
of relying on ES increases to $42, while the opportunity cost of being uninformed is only $29. Here,
although ES provides some information about energy efficiency, it still makes consumers worst-off,
relative to the scenario where no information is provided. This is a counterintuitive result. This
shows that by excluding the label effect from the consumer surplus, the certification is effectively
acting as a bias. Ex post, consumers are then worst-off because the label led them to pay too much
for certified products.
Turning to other metrics, under perfect information, consumers choose more energy efficient
refrigerators, on average. The reduction in electricity consumption under ES is similar to the
reduction achieved with only uninformed consumers. The certification then brings modest welfare
gains from the reduction in externality costs. The fact that the certification requirement is set in
relative terms and depends on other attributes, such as size, explains this result.
The size of the externality costs under the information acquisition model is $14 per refrigerator
sold. The opportunity cost of imperfect energy information measured in terms of consumer surplus

32

net of the externality costs thus ranges between $34 to $40, depending on how the label effect is
interpreted.
Firms are better off when consumers are not perfectly informed, and would gain the most if all
consumers were to rely on ES. This implies that firms maintain larger markups on certified products.
This estimate should, however, be interpreted with an important caveat. If all consumers were
perfectly informed, firms would make different product line and pricing decisions. In the mediumterm, the impact on profits could then be different. In a related paper (Houde 2013), I show that
once product line and pricing decisions are endogenized, the large willingness to pay for the ES
label allows firms to charge larger markups not only on certified products, but also on non-certified
products. In sum, firms appear to benefit largely from the existence of the certification both in the
short and long-run.
The above results also suggest that firms’ provision of energy information may not be fully
compatible with the social planner’s objective. Using a similar framework, Sallee (2013) shows that
firms may be better off distorting the provision of other non-energy attributes so that consumers
pay less attention to energy efficiency.
Overall, once I account for the change in consumer surplus, externalities, and profits, there
is an opportunity cost associated with consumers not being perfectly informed that ranges from
$12 to $17 per refrigerator sold. Assuming a market size of 9.01 million (DOE 2011), the value
of perfect energy information is more than $108M/year for the refrigerator market alone. To put
this number in perspective, the EPA and the DOE have spent $57.4 M/year, on average, during
the period 2008-2011 to run the whole ES program (US Government Accountability Office GAO),
which includes more than sixty categories of products.

8.2. Sensitivity Tests
In the online Appendix E, several sensitivity tests are presented. The results are summarized below.
Electricity Prices, Rebates. Electricity prices and financial incentives for ES products vary
widely across the US. Table 10 provides estimates of the opportunity costs for a scenario with low

33

electricity prices, and no rebate. In this scenario, the average electricity price is set at 0.08 $/kWh
for all consumers.
As expected, lower electricity prices translate in a lower value of energy information for consumers. Consumers are simply more likely to not pay attention to energy efficiency. In this
scenario, the overall opportunity cost, accounting for the change in consumer surplus, externalities,
and profits is between $4 to $8.
Table 11 presents estimates where the electricity price is set at 0.16 $/kWh, and a $50 rebate
is offered to all consumers. In this scenario, the value of energy information is much larger for
consumers, and the opposite for firms. On the other hand, the externality costs remain unaffected,
relative to the previous scenarios. The overall opportunity cost now ranges from $21 to $25.
Choice Set. In constructing the choice set for each household, I use all refrigerator models present
in the sample during the year 2008. As a result, the choice sets include several models that meet the
previous certification requirement, but are no longer certified. As observed on Figure 7(b), these
products exit the market in the long term. In equilibrium, firms try to maintain a distribution of
products that either just meet the minimum standard or the ES certification. In this scenario, I
modified the choice sets to reflect such an equilibrium. In particular, all models that just meet the
previous requirement, i.e., that are 15% more efficient than the minimum standard, were excluded
(Figure 7(b)).
The main take away is that under this scenario, relying solely on ES has a much lower opportunity
cost (Table 12). If there is close to perfect bunching at the minimum standard and ES in the product
offering, the loss in accuracy incurred by trading-off energy efficiency in a binary manner becomes
minimal. This explains that bunching can be sustained in equilibrium. If firms offer products that
bunch at the minimum standard and ES, consumers have higher incentive to use the certification as
a decision heuristic, which in turn reinforces firms’ incentives to bunch. Whether these distortions
are welfare improving is unclear. The coarse nature of the certification crowds out consumers’ and
firms’ incentives to purchase and offer products that exceed the ES requirement. As a result, the
certification might have the unintended consequence to reduce the provision of energy efficiency.

34

9. Conclusion
This paper first shows that consumers, on average, respond to both the ES certification and electricity costs in the appliance purchasing decision. It then provides evidence that consumers are
heterogeneous in the way they respond to different pieces of energy information. The main contribution of the paper is a structural estimator that classifies consumers in three types: consumers
that rely on a continuous measure of electricity costs, consumers that rely on the ES certification,
and consumers that do not pay attention to energy-related information. Identification comes from
the fact that consumer types respond differently to changes in relative prices, choice sets, and decertification events; each type is thus associated with a specific substitution pattern. Empirically,
the prevalence of each substitution pattern determines the share of consumers that belongs to each
type.
The estimator provides several insights on how a certification that summarizes complex, but
easily accessible information influences choices. In the present context, for the share of consumers
that rely on an accurate measure of electricity costs, the certification appears to have no effect. On
the other hand, consumers that rely on ES have a high willingness to pay for the label itself that
is well beyond the value of the energy savings associated with certified products. From a welfare
standpoint, the interpretation of the label effect has important implications. Further research is,
however, needed to better identify the mechanisms that explain the strong effect of the ES label,
and whether those mechanisms apply to other contexts.
The policy analysis shows that a consumer in the US refrigerator market loses between $19 to
$24, on average, for not being perfectly informed about electricity costs. If all consumers were
perfectly informed, choices would be more energy efficient, and the externality costs would be
reduced by $14 per refrigerator sold. Interestingly, the opportunity costs measured in terms of
externality costs do not differ by a large amount whether consumers rely solely on the certification
or are completely uniformed about electricity costs. Firms are better off when not all consumers
are perfectly informed, and benefit the most when consumers rely on ES.
Accounting for the change in consumer surplus, externality costs, and profits, I find that the
overall opportunity cost of imperfect energy information ranges from $12 to $17 per refrigerator

35

sold. Scaling these estimates by the size of the refrigerator market, the total size of the opportunity
cost is $108M/year, a number twice as large the annual program costs of ES.

Notes: The restricted sample consists of all transactions made by homeowners living in single
family housing units that bought no more than one refrigerator in any given year. The number of
full-size refrigerator models for the whole US was obtained from the US EPA. According to the
FTC data, there were 2,693 full-size refrigerators offered on the US market in 2008.

Notes: In each column, a choice model is compared to a model where all consumers are perfectly informed. The first
column compares the outcomes obtained with the information acquisition model. The second column compares a
choice model where all consumers are uninformed. The third column compares a choice model where all consumers
rely on ENERGY STAR. The table shows that the consumers surplus decreases in all cases when consumers are not
perfectly informed, but profits increase. The externality costs increase under imperfect information.

Online Appendix
Appendix A. Comparative Statics Results
Information Acquisition Costs. Naturally, we should expect that consumers will collect and
process more energy information the lower the costs to do so. In particular, a consumer should
always choose to be fully informed if there are no extra costs. The present model is consistent with
this intuition, whether ENERGY STAR information is available or not.
(i) Suppose that ENERGY STAR information is not available. If K(e =

Proposition 1.

U ) = K(e = I), it is optimal for the consumer to select e = h.
(ii) Suppose that ENERGY STAR information is available. If K(e = U ) = K(e = ES) = K(e =
I), it is optimal for the consumer to select e = I. Moreover, if K(e = U ) = K(e = ES),
e = ES is strictly better than e = U for the consumer.
Proof. This is true by the fact that the expectation of the maximum of random variables is always
greater that the maximum of their expectations. In particular, consider some set of random variables {Y1 , Y2 , ..., Yk }. The distribution of max1≤j≤k {Yj } (first order) stochastically dominates the
distribution of Yl for any l ∈ {1, ..., k}. This implies that E[max1≤j≤k Yj ] ≥ E[Yl ] for l = 1, ..., k,
and thus,
E[ max Yj ] ≥ max E[Yj ].

To show (i), it suffices to show that



E,C max{Uij (δj , ηPj , Cj , ij )} ≥ E max{EC [Uij (δj , ηPj , Cj , ij )]} ,

which implies that (i) holds for K = 0. I show a stronger inequality; in particular, that for any ij ,



EC max{Uij (δj , ηPj , Cj , ij )} ≥ max{EC [Uij (δj , ηPj , Cj , ij )]} .

This follows from (14) if I set
Yj ≡ Uij (δj , ηPj , Cj , ij ).

52

This concludes the proof for (i).
The proof for (ii) is similar.
Crowding-Out Effect. A simple, but important implication to the above result is that if the costs
of processing and collecting ENERGY STAR information are lower than the costs of searching for
energy costs, some consumers may prefer to select the maximum level of effort than to not collect
information at all, but could prefer a medium level of effort than a maximum one. Formally,
Corollary 1. If K(e = ES) < K(e = I), then for some consumers
V(e = U ) < V(e = I) < V(e = ES)

Proof. The proof follows directly from Proposition 1.
This formally shows that the ENERGY STAR certification induces some consumers to be less
informed and crowds out efforts to fully account for energy costs.
Uncertainty about Energy Costs. The present model stipulates that uncertainty in beliefs is
the main driver that induces consumers to search for energy information. Therefore, the model
should predict that the larger the uncertainty in beliefs, the more likely consumers are to search.
I now show this result. I focus on the case that consumers’ beliefs become more uncertain, but
remain unbiased. This scenario is notably consistent with Allcott (2011)’s findings that shows that
consumers’ beliefs about future gas prices are on average unbiased, but largely uncertain.
Consider the following definition. Beliefs about X represented by a distribution F̂ are more
uncertain that beliefs F if F second order stochastically dominates F̂ :

for all b.

Proof. First note that by the definition of second order stochastically dominance, if Xj second-order
stochastically dominates X̂j , and if Xj and X̂j have the same mean, then E[h(Xj )] ≥ E[h(X̂j )] for
all concave function h. Given that the maximum is a concave function, I then have E[h(Xj , Y )] ≥
E[h(X̂j , Y )] for any variable Y .
Proposition 2 simply says that the larger the variance in energy costs, the higher is the value
of information. This also implies that ENERGY STAR will lead to more sub-optimal choices, in
expectation, in choice sets where products are largely disperse in the energy efficiency characteristics
space.

Appendix B. Data Cleaning and Manipulation
Creating a Random Sample. To perform the estimation of the demand model, a random subsample of the transactions is used. The sub-sample is constructed as follow.
First, the sub-sample is drawn from the set of transactions that fit the following criteria (the
restricted sample):
• transactions made by consumers that are homeowners;
• transactions made by consumers living in single family housing units; and
• transactions made by consumers that made no more that one refrigerator purchase in any
given year.
Second, the following stratified sampling method is used to create the sub-sample. For a given
targeted sample size, I sample transactions for three different income groups:
• households with income of less than ≥$50,000;
• households with income between $50,000 and $100,000;
• and households with income of more than $100,000.
Average Electricity Prices. The use of average electricity prices is partly motivated by recent
empirical evidence (Borenstein (2010), Ito (2012)) that suggests that electricity consumers may in
fact respond to variation in average prices, more than marginal prices. In the present case, the use
of average electricity prices is also dictated by the fact that household’s location is not perfectly
known. Therefore, it is impossible to match households with their exact electricity tariff and infer
marginal price.
Average electricity prices at the county level are computed as follow. Using form EIA-861 of
the Energy Information Administration, I compute the average residential electric price for each
electric utility operating in the US for the years 2008. I then match electric utility territories with
each of the county where I sampled at least one store. For counties with only one electric utility, I

55

use the average electricity price for this particular utility. For counties with several electric utilities,
I take the arithmetic mean of each utility average price to construct the county level price.

Appendix C. Alternative Estimators
The Average Consumer. Adding an outside option to the conditional logit, I obtain a linear
expression for the market shares in region r at time t (Berry 1994):
(16)

ln(qjrt ) = τ Djt − ηPjrt + ψRrt XDjt − θCjr + γj + αr + αt + ζjrt

where qjrt is the quantity of refrigerator model j sold during week t in store r, and ζjrt is a marketspecific unobservable. Not all refrigerator models sell every week in every store, the dependent
variable thus takes the value zero for a large number of observations. Equation 16 is then estimated
with a negative binomial model. The sample used for the estimation consists of all transactions
observed during the period 2007-2009. Stores with a low number of sales were excluded, which
left 545 stores for the estimation. Price time series for each refrigerator model are week and store
specific. The choice set are store and month specific, and constructed using the same methodology
than for the conditional logit model.
In the first specification, product, week, and store fixed effects are included, and the electricity
prices averaged at the county level are used. The estimate of the price coefficient corresponds to an
own-price elasticity of -2.89, which is about half the elasticity obtained with the conditional logit
model. The present price elasticity has a different interpretation here given that an outside option
has been added, and can be interpreted as being long-run. The size of the label effect is 0.041, and
corresponds to a WTP for the ENERGY STAR label of 18$. This replicates closely the estimate
obtained with the condition logit (19$). The effect of rebate is negative and not significant. The
estimate of the coefficient on electricity costs is negative and significant, and implies a discount
rate of 41%, which is lower than for the conditional logit model (62%).
The second specification replace the week fixed effects, with brand-week fixed effects. Like in
the conditional logit model, it has few effects on the price coefficient, suggesting that marketing

56

efforts are not an important source of bias. The coefficient for the ENERGY STAR label is larger
under this specification.
The third specification uses electricity prices averaged at the state level. This impacts the
coefficient on electricity costs. The coefficient still negative and significant, but implies a discount
rate of 29%. Similar than in the condition logit model, measurement error in how electricity prices
are measured has an important effect.
The fourth specification includes store-year fixed effects. This provides a better control for any
region specific unobservables. Doing so has few impact on the coefficients.
Interaction with Demographics. Table 8 presents the results from a conditional logit model
where the coefficient on prices is interacted with demographic information, in addition of the
coefficients on electricity costs, and ENERGY STAR dummy. The results complement Table 4,
and show that the main patterns hold.

Appendix D. FKRB’s Estimator
The FKRB’s estimator models the CDF of the random parameters as a mixture of point masses.
Alternatively, FKRB propose to estimate a smooth density by modeling the distribution of the
parameters as a mixture of normal densities. This requires to specify M normal basis functions
with a predetermined mean and variance, and use simulation to construct the estimator.
In particular, the mth basis function is defined as the product of the marginals of the K random
parameters:
(17)

N (β|µm , σ m ) =

K
Y

m
N (β|µm
k , σk )

k=1

The simulated choice probability is thus given by:
(18)

Qijrt ≈

S

P m m,s

where β m,s is the sth draw from the rth normal basis. The estimate of α is thus given by:

For the present application, η, ψ and γj are taken as data, and they are fixed at the MLE
estimates (Model 1, Table 2). The joint density of the parameters θ and τ is a mixture of M = 108
normal basis functions. To construct the basis functions, 9 marginals for the parameter θ, and 11
marginals for the parameter τ are used. The means of the marginals are defined relative to the MLE
estimates of the coefficients τ̂ and θ̂. In particular, the means of the marginals for the parameter θ
is the vector: [2.25θ̂, 2θ̂, 1.75θ̂, 1.25θ̂, θ̂, 0.75θ̂, 0.5θ̂, 0.25θ̂, 0.05θ̂]. The means of the marginals for the
parameter τ is the vector: [8τ̂ , 6τ̂ , 4τ̂ , 2.5τ̂ , 1.75τ̂ , 1.25τ̂ , τ̂ , 0.75τ̂ , 0.5τ̂ , 0.25τ̂ , 0]. For each marginal,

60

the standard deviation is set to a small value corresponding to 0.1% of the mean of the marginal.
The estimation is carried with the matlab package lsqlin.
