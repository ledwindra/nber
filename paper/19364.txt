The Effect of Maternal Employment on Children’s Academic Performance

JEL No. J13,J22
ABSTRACT
Using a Danish data set that follows 135,000 Danish children from birth through 9th grade, we examine
the effect of maternal employment during a child’s first three and first 15 years on that child’s grade
point average in 9th grade. We address the endogeneity of employment by including a rich set of household
control variables, instrumenting for employment with the gender- and education-specific local unemployment
rate, and by including maternal fixed effects. We find that maternal employment has a positive effect
on children’s academic performance in all specifications, particularly when women work part-time.
This is in contrast with the larger literature on maternal employment, much of which takes place in
other contexts, and which finds no or a small negative effect of maternal employment on children’s
cognitive development and academic performance.

I. Introduction
The labor force participation rate of mothers with young children has increased
substantially in developed countries over the past 50 years. In the United States, for example,
71% of mothers were working in 2011 (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2012). Given the continued
primacy of mothers as the main providers of child care (Bianchi 2000; Bianchi, Milkie, Sayer,
and Robinson 2000), these increases in maternal employment lead to concerns about the
tradeoffs working mothers must face in terms of time investments in work vs. time spent at
home. To increase the quantity and quality of the time mothers spend with their infants, and
based on the belief that the early months of a child’s life are important for future cognitive and
emotional development (Lewis and Brooks-Gunn 1979; Harris 1983), many countries and states
have passed laws allowing women to take more paid and/or unpaid leave following their child’s
birth, including the U.S. in 1993, Canada in 2000, Denmark in 2002, the United Kingdom in
2003 and 2007, and California in 2003. However, what is as yet unknown is how maternal
employment over a longer time period causally influences child well-being.
This paper estimates the causal effect of employment among Danish women on one
measure of children’s well-being: their academic performance in high school. There are several
ways that a mother’s employment decisions may affect her child’s cognitive development and
academic performance. First, working generates household income that can be used to purchase
inputs that directly or indirectly improve academic performance. Second, all else equal, a
working mother will spend less time with her child than one who does not work. Depending on
the quality of the time a mother spends with her child and the quality of the alternative, this may
either improve or diminish cognitive development. Third, maternal employment may improve
academic performance if working mothers serve as positive role models for their children.

2

A large body of research in the United States has examined the consequences of maternal
employment for children (Korenman and Kaestner 2005; Smolensky and Gootman 2003; Blau
and Currie 2004; Ruhm 2000, and Haveman and Wolfe 1994). Results are mixed, with some
studies showing that maternal employment in the first months of life is associated with small, but
significant, declines in children’s subsequent cognitive outcomes (Hill, Waldfogel, BrooksGunn, and Han 2005), particularly when mothers worked more than 30 hours per week (BrooksGunn, Han, and Waldfogel 2002).
A child’s characteristics may influence both his mother’s labor supply decisions and his
academic performance (Ruhm 2004). For example, mothers whose children are not doing well
socially or academically may reduce their work hours to invest more time in child-rearing.
Conversely, mothers with relatively high ability and education may be both more likely to work
and to have children who receive good grades in school. Few of the early papers in this literature
developed empirical methods to account for unobserved factors that could be linked to both
maternal employment and child achievement. Failure to control for unobserved maternal
characteristics is likely to bias estimates of the association between maternal employment and
children’s subsequent academic outcomes.
A number of recent studies, many of which use data from Europe or Canada, address this
concern and attempt to estimate the causal effect of maternal employment on children’s
cognitive development or academic performance. These studies use methods such as a
regression discontinuity or differences-in-differences design to take advantage of changes in
maternal leave policies that affect birth cohorts differently (Dustman and Schonberg 2012;
Carneiro, Løken, and Salvanes 2011; Rasumussen 2010; Baker and Milligan 2010; Liu and
Skans 2010); maternal fixed effects to compare outcomes between children from the same family

3

(James-Burdamy 2005; Ruhm 2004); comparing the children of parents who lost their job when
a plant closed to those who did not (Rege, Telle, and Votruba 2011); or exploiting exogenous
variation in labor demand across markets to identify the effect of maternal employment in a
structural model (Bernal 2008). The results of these studies are mixed: six studies find that
maternal employment (or, in some cases, policies that extend maternal leave) either has no effect
or a negligible effect on children’s cognitive development, whereas three studies conclude that
maternal employment worsens children’s cognitive development. Notably, none of these studies
concludes that maternal employment improves a child’s test scores or academic performance.
Our paper makes several contributions to this literature. First, we take advantage of a
unique data set that contains detailed household information and follows 135,000 Danish
children who were born between 1987 and 1992 from birth through 9th grade. This allows us to
examine the impact of maternal employment over an extended period of time (i.e., a child’s first
15 years of life) on an important, long-run outcome: grades in 9th grade. Second, we develop
three different methods to address the endogeneity of maternal employment. Third, we explore
whether maternal employment improves children’s educational performance by increasing the
economic resources available for investing in human capital formation.
We address the endogeneity of maternal employment in three different ways. First, we
use the extensive data available from the Danish registers to control for many household and
children’s characteristics that may affect both children’s educational outcomes and maternal
employment decisions. The registers contain a rich set of measures, including whether a child
was born prematurely, had low birth weight or a chronic health condition; the age of the mother
when the child was born, and the percentage of the child’s first 15 (or three) years that the
mother spent in school. Second, we instrument for maternal employment with the female

4

unemployment rate, conditional on a woman’s education level, in her local area in a particular
year. Our identifying assumption is that the local unemployment rate affects a child’s
subsequent GPA by affecting the mother’s employment choices only, and does not have a direct
effect on GPA through, for example, school funding levels. 1 Third, we use maternal fixed
effects to exploit differences in maternal employment between siblings within the same family.
In our preferred instrumental variables specification we find a positive association
between the intensity of maternal employment in a child’s first three years and a child’s GPA at
age 15. The child of a woman who worked 10-19 hours per week while her child was under the
age of four is predicted to have a GPA that is 2.6 percent higher than an otherwise similar child
whose mother did not work at all. The effects of maternal employment are larger when we
examine a mother’s employment history over the child’s first 15 years of life, indicating that the
maternal employment effect is cumulative over many years, rather than being focused only on a
child’s first few years. Including a mother’s pre-birth income or contemporaneous income does
not materially change the coefficient estimates, which indicates that the beneficial impact of
maternal employment does not appear to occur due to greater available household resources.
These results stand in sharp contrast to the nine studies cited above, which find no relationship or
a negative relationship between maternal employment and a child’s cognitive development or
academic performance.
The remainder of this paper is divided into six sections. We review the existing literature
in Section II and describe social policies that may affect the relationship between maternal
employment and children’s academic performance in Denmark in Section III. Section IV
introduces the unique Danish register data and discusses how these data are superior to survey

In some of the IV specifications we include a full set of locality exposure variables to capture time-invariant
differences across markets in the quality of education and ability of students.

data. In Section V we present the three models and discuss the advantages and shortcomings of
our instrument and maternal fixed effects. We report the results for all three models in Section
VI and conclude in Section VII.
II. Previous Research
One way to address the endogeneity of maternal employment is to include a rich set of
household characteristics in an ordinary least squares or propensity score regression. Five
recent studies that have taken this approach conclude that there is no association or a negative
association between maternal employment and children’s cognitive and behavioral development.
Four of these studies use National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data from the United
States to examine children’s verbal and math skills beginning as early as three years of age and
continuing thereafter (Baum 2003; Ruhm 2004; Berger, Hill, and Waldfogel 2005; and Ruhm
2008); Berger, Hill, and Waldfogel (2005) also examine a measure of children’s externalizing
behavior at age four. 2 Baum (2003) and Berger, Hill, and Waldfogel (2005) focus on whether a
woman returns to work within 12 weeks of having a baby in order to match the maternal leave
length allowed by the U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), whereas the two studies by
Ruhm examine maternal employment during a child’s first four (Ruhm 2004) or 10 (Ruhm 2008)
years of life. A fifth study using this approach finds that the children of women in the United
Kingdom who worked full-time in their child’s first 18 months of life perform relatively poorly
on cognitive tests between the ages of four and seven relative to children of women who worked
part-time or not at all (Gregg, Washbrook, Propper, and Burgess 2005).
Two of the five recent OLS/propensity score studies mentioned above found that the
association between maternal employment and children’s cognitive development differed by

household characteristics. The effect of maternal employment was more strongly negative
among children of highly educated women (Gregg, Washbrook, Propper, and Burgess 2005) and
women with high socioeconomic status (Ruhm 2008). Other studies find that children may fare
best when mothers work part-time (Brooks-Gunn, Han and Waldfogel 2002; Ruhm 2008; Hill,
Waldfogel, Brooks-Gunn and Han 2005).
One criticism of the above studies is that there may be important unobserved variables,
such as the health and cognitive ability of a young child, that affect a woman’s labor supply
decisions, even with rich data sets such as the NLSY. Nine recent studies address this concern
and try to estimate the causal effect of maternal employment on children’s cognitive
development or academic performance by using a regression discontinuity or differences-indifferences design, maternal fixed effects, or by exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in labor
supply due to plant closings or differences across markets in labor demand.
The results of the studies that develop econometric methods to address the endogeneity of
maternal employment are mixed: six of these recent studies find that maternal employment or
expanding maternity leave either has no effect or a negligible effect on children’s cognitive
development or academic performance, whereas three studies conclude that maternal
employment worsens children’s cognitive development. Dustman and Schonberg (2012) find
that extending maternity leave in Germany had a negligible effect on the probability of
completing high school or on wages. Likewise, expanding maternity leave by six months in
Canada had negligible effects on children’s motor skills, social skills, and temperament (Baker
and Milligan 2010), as did a 1984 policy in Denmark expanding maternity leave by six weeks on
subsequent high school enrollment, high school completion rates, and high school grades
(Rasmussen 2010). Rege, Telle, and Votruba (2011) find that children whose mothers lost their

7

jobs in Norway due to a plant closing while the children were in eighth or ninth grade had a
similar grade point average in 10th grade as other children. 3 Using maternal fixed effects and
NLSY data from the United States, Ruhm (2004) finds no statistically significant effect of
maternal employment on children’s test scores, and James-Burdumy (2005) finds negative,
positive, and no effects depending on the test score used and the particular time period when
maternal employment is measured (with the strongest negative effects occurring when mothers
were employed in the first year of life).
As mentioned, three studies that attempt to estimate a causal effect of maternal
employment report stronger evidence that maternal employment predicts reduced child outcomes
than the six reviewed in the previous paragraph. Carneiro, Loken and Salvanes (2011) find that a
four-month increase in maternity leave in Norway was associated with a decline in high school
dropout rates and an increase in wages, while in Sweden, extended parental leave was associated
with improvements in children’s educational performance, but only among children with highly
educated mothers (Liu and Skans 2010). Finally, Bernal (2008) uses NLSY data to estimate a
structural model of children’s educational performance and maternal employment, and concludes
that full-time maternal employment in the first year reduces children’s high school test scores.
Notably, none of the 14 studies we review in this Section conclude that there is a beneficial
impact of maternal employment on children’s cognitive development.
The majority of studies in this area link maternal employment in the very earliest years of
life to child outcomes. Only one study (Ruhm 2008), has examined at least 10 years of
childhood, comparing earlier vs. later childhood employment effects on child development,
finding that it is employment in the first three years of life that has the strongest, and negative,
associations with child cognitive development.

These authors find that if a father lost his job due to a plant closing, the child’s 10th grade were adversely affected.

III. Maternal Employment and Social Policies in Denmark
In this section we discuss how and why maternal employment might be associated with
child well-being in general, and how this may play out given the maternity leave, child care, and
other social policies in place in Denmark. Maternal employment in Denmark is among the
highest in the OECD. Among mothers of children between the ages of one and three, labor force
participation increased from 70 percent in 2002 to 80 percent in 2008, and from 76 percent to 82
percent for mothers of children between the ages of four and six (Authors’ calculations). While
maternal employment rates are higher in Denmark compared to the U.S., work hours conditional
on being employed are lower in part because weekly work hours cannot exceed 37 in Denmark
(Greve 2011).
From a child development perspective, maternal employment involves a trade-off
between time devoted to parenting and money, both of which should positively influence a
child’s cognitive development. Studies consistently show that children benefit when economic
resources available to a household increase (Duncan and Brooks-Gunn 1997; Duncan, ZiolGuest and Kalil 2010). Maternal employment patterns may reduce both the quality and quantity
of time children spend with parents, which are key ingredients in healthy development (National
Research Council and Institute of Medicine 2000). U.S. time-diary data show that working
reduces the time mothers spend with children, although mothers protect quality time with
children by cutting back least on activities directly engaging children (Bianchi 2000).
However, the time-related linkages between maternal employment and child well-being
will be affected by maternal leave policies, the quality of child care available, and restrictions on
the number of hours per week people can work once they return to the labor force. Denmark has
a generous maternal leave policy. During our sample period (children born between 1987 and

9

1992), Danish women were entitled to four weeks of paid maternal leave before the delivery; 14
weeks immediately following delivery; and 10 weeks of additional parental leave that could be
shared between parents.
Denmark also has a strong system of early care and education (ECE) programs, spending
1.2 percent of its GDP on ECE activities. As a result, Danish households spend on average only
eight percent of their income on child care costs; in contrast, the U.S spends 0.4 percent of its
GDP on ECE activities, and families spend 19 percent of their income, on average, on child care
(Ruhm 2011). 4 Danish child care is provided at the municipality level, with the local
governments providing center-based care as well as organizing a system of family-based care in
private homes (Datta Gupta and Simonsen, 2010). The staff-to-child ratio in Denmark is among
the lowest in the OECD (Datta Gupta, Smith and Verner 2008), indicating a high quality of child
care. As a result of this investment, 63 percent of zero to two year olds and 94 percent of three
year olds are in some type of formal child care in Denmark.
The extensive paid maternity leave time, relatively lower work hours, and generous ECE
system in Denmark suggest that working mothers may face less constrained choices, and
therefore the implications of maternal employment for child well-being may differ, compared to
those in other countries. The goal of this paper is to examine the linkages between maternal
employment and the academic progress of 15 year old Danish teens. Because of the large body
of work, noted above, suggesting that maternal employment in the first three years of life has
particular implications for child well-being, and a lack of studies examining maternal
employment across childhood, we perform separate analyses looking at maternal employment in
the first three years, and then in the first 15 years, of childhood. Because of evidence, cited

Denmark ranks second out of all OECD countries, behind only Iceland, on percent of GDP devoted to ECE
programs.

10

above, of non-linear associations between maternal work hours and child well-being, we
examine how child GPA differs based on varying intensity of maternal work. Finally, because of
studies indicating that the detrimental linkages between maternal employment and child wellbeing are concentrated among more advantaged mothers (Ruhm 2008), we perform some
analyses stratifying our sample by maternal education.
IV. Data
Since 1980, Statistics Denmark has collected and recorded data on all individuals living
in Denmark. The registers contain all public transfer payments between individuals and the
federal/municipal government, such as income taxes, parental leave benefits, day care subsidies,
unemployment benefits, and pension payments. Danish law requires individuals to inform the
federal government of their residential location; individuals who fail to comply are not allowed
to have a bank account or receive benefits from the state. As a result, the registers contain
information on the entire Danish population, with attrition only due to deaths or migration.
Our sample includes all children born in Denmark between 1987 and 1992 to mothers
who had at least two children during this time period. We focus on this time period because the
registers contain grade point averages (GPA) in 9th grade for these children, which for most
Danish children is when they are 15 years of age. We restrict the sample to families with at least
two children born in this time period to have a consistent sample between the ordinary least
squares, instrumental variables, and maternal fixed effects models (the latter of which, described
below, are limited to mothers with at least two children).
The dependent variable in our analysis is a child’s GPA in 9th grade. For the measure to
be comparable between students, we use a GPA from three 9th grade courses that all Danish
students take: Math, English, and Danish. Although some Danish schools offer additional

11

subjects such as German, French and Chinese, we exclude these grades from the GPA measure
because these subjects are taught for only a few hours per week and only in later grades. Each
school reports the grades annually to the Ministry of Education, which in turn forwards the
information to Statistics Denmark.
In all regressions we include birth-year and birth-month fixed effects to control for
national GPA trends in Denmark and age effects within a grade. In most regressions we include
a more complete set of control variables, including: indicators for a child’s birth order in his/her
family, the child’s gender, the mother’s age when the child was born, and the mother’s education
the year before the child was born. We measure a woman’s education with six separate indicator
variables: less than a high school degree, high school degree only, vocational school, short-term
further education, bachelor degree, and master’s degree or more. We use mothers’ age when the
child was born, her education, and her pre-birth income as proxies for pre-birth ability. Mothers
who have their children early have both a higher probability of dropping out of school and being
unemployed.
Maternal labor supply decisions may be affected by the number of children, such that
those with more children spend more time in home production, and also by child birth order, as
mothers with older children may be able to rely on these children to provide help at home. A
woman’s decision regarding whether and how much to work following a child’s birth may be
affected by the child’s health (Powers 2001). From the fertility register records we create
indicator variables for children who were born prematurely (born earlier than the 37th week),
who had low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams), or who have chronic health conditions. The
registers include the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of
Diseases (ICD) codes for all hospitalizations in Denmark. To classify a child as having a chronic

12

health condition, we use the same definition of chronic diseases as Christoffersen et al. (2003):
diseases that are non-psychological and persistent, such as diabetes. Because the codes do not
specify disease severity, we classify children as being chronically ill if they were hospitalized for
one or more of the designated chronic diseases between 1987 and 1996, a period when all of the
children in our sample were at least five years old.
Although the registers do not record a person’s race, they do indicate whether a person
immigrated to Denmark or whether the previous generation of the family immigrated to
Denmark. We include indicators for whether a child is a first- or second-generation immigrant.
We estimate a woman’s net income based on her wages and other cash transfers, taking into
account interest deductions. In some regressions we control for the mother’s income the year
prior to a child’s birth as an additional control for her ability. Income is measured in thousands
of Danish Kroner, where a thousand Kroner is about $170. In unreported regressions we include
the average income a woman received over her child’s first three (or 15) years rather than her
income prior to the child’s birth. The latter measure allows us to explore whether maternal
employment improves children’s cognitive outcomes by increasing the amount of resources
available to the household.
Although hours worked are not directly recorded in the registers, using information on
the magnitude of certain tax payments, we can place mothers into one of four employment
categories in each calendar year: fewer than 10 hours worked per week, on average for that year;
between 10 and 19 hours per week; between 20 and 29 hours per week; or 30 hours or more per
week. Individuals who work at least one-half of a calendar year will pay the labor market
additional pension, referred to as the ATP tax, and the magnitude of this tax allows us to infer
their work hours. Thus, we assume that people working less than 10 hours per week are

13

unemployed. Additional analyses using survey data, not shown here, indicate that the vast
majority of mothers classified as working 0-9 hours per week are indeed not working. 5
Time spent on maternity leave is measured in the registers as being unemployed. During
our sample period (children born between 1987 and 1992) Danish women were entitled to less
than one-half a year of maternity leave: four weeks before the delivery; 14 weeks immediately
following delivery; and 10 weeks of additional parental leave that could be shared between
spouses. As a consequence, mothers who used all of their maternity leave during this time
period and then worked full-time for the rest of the year will be categorized as working 30 hours
or more for the entire calendar year. People who did not make any tax payments and did not
receive unemployment benefits are classified as unemployed. This could occur for adults out of
the labor force or immigrants who have not yet formalized their citizenship.
We are interested in estimating the effect of a woman’s work effort during her child’s
first three years and first 15 years of life, on the child’s grade point average at age 15. To
estimate a woman’s average weekly hours worked during a child’s first 15 years of life (and
similarly for the first three year of life), we create four indicator variables for each adult for each
calendar year: 1) unemployed; 2) working 10-19 hours per week; 3) working 20-29 hours per
week; and 4) working 30 or more hours per week. In some regression specifications we include
the percentage of her child’s first 15 (or three) years a woman spent in each of these work-hour
groups, as follows:
𝑎𝑣_𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘_0 =

∑ 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠 𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑒𝑑
15

5

We cannot determine the actual work hours if people receive unemployment benefits for at least one-half of a
calendar year; additionally, those who work fewer than 10 hours per week do not pay ATP. We assign people who
receive unemployment benefits for at least one-half of a calendar year as working between zero and nine hours per
week, although some of them may work more than 10 hours per week for part of the year.

𝑎𝑣_𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘_1 =

15

𝑎𝑣_𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘_3 =

∑ 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 30 + ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠
15

We observe the full 15-year employment history for 56 percent of the mothers. About 15
percent of the women have missing work hours information in a given year, and this missing rate
is fairly constant over the 1987 to 2007 time period when the children in the sample are less than
16 years old. Work hours are missing for women who retire early or drop out of the labor force
altogether. Therefore, if a mother has missing work hours information in a given year, we
assume that she is unemployed or working less than 10 hours per week in that year. For analyses
looking at maternal employment measured over the first 15 years of life, we exclude about five
percent of the women who have missing work hour information for all 15 years when their child
is under the age of 16. When examining maternal employment over the first three years of life,
we exclude 10.6 percent of women who have missing information for all three years when their
child is under the age of four.
In some regression specifications we include an estimate of a woman’s average hours
worked per week over the first 15 years (or three years) of her child’s life rather than a series of
variables indicating the percentage of years working in each of the four hour categories. This
allows us to utilize a continuous work hour variable, which is necessary for the two-stage least
squares specification. Because the work hour categories are intervals, for purposes of estimating
a continuous employment variable we assign hours in the middle of an interval (e.g., 15 hours
per week for women working between 10 and 19 hours per week in a particular year). We
15

assume that women working 30 or more hours per week actually worked 35 hours, and women
working less than 10 hours per week were actually unemployed.
Figure 1 depicts the pattern of maternal employment by a child’s age for the first 15 years
of a child’s life. About 75 percent of Danish mothers worked when their child was one year old,
with the majority of the employed mothers working more than 30 hours per week. The
percentage of mothers working more than 30 hours per week increases as children age,
increasing from 47 percent when a child is one, to 61 percent when a child is five, to 76 percent
when a child is 10, and to 82 percent when a child is 15 years old. The percentage of nonworking mothers decreases as children grow up; by age 15, six percent of the mothers are
unemployed or working less than 10 hours per week. Twelve percent of the mothers work parttime (10 to 19 hours or 20 to 29 hours per week) when children are 15 years old, in contrast to 28
percent when children are one.
In Table 1 we examine common employment patterns for women in the sample. The
Table reports the percentage of women by the number of years (out of 15) they spend in a
particular work-hour category. Sixteen percent of the mothers worked 30 or more hours every
year when their child was under the age of 16, and almost one-half worked 30 or more hours in
at least 10 of these 15 years. Thirty-five percent of the women worked fewer than 10 hours
(including zero) in at least one of the 15 years, although only one percent worked fewer than 10
hours in 10 or more of the 15 years. Many women worked 10-19 or 20-29 hours at some point
when their child was under the age of 16.
Once we omit households with missing values, 119,310 children remain in the analytic
data set used to examine a woman’s employment in her child’s first three years of life, and
134,595 used to examine a child’s first 15 years of life. We report sample statistics in Table 2

for the former sample, separately by the average number of hours per week that a mother worked
during her child’s first three years of life based on the continuous work hour variable. The
children of women who work relatively long hours have relatively high GPAs. Women who
work relatively long hours also are more educated, are more likely to live in Copenhagen, tend to
have children at an older age, and tend to have healthier children. These differences emphasize
the importance of controlling for both children’s and mother’s characteristics in the regression
models, and of trying to control for differences across employment categories in unobserved
characteristics that affect children’s GPAs. We elaborate on our approach to this challenge in the
following section.
V. Method
Our basic empirical approach is to regress a child’s GPA at age 15 on his/her mother’s
employment status and work hours during the first three years of the child’s life, and separately
during the first 15 years of the child’s life. The regression coefficient on the maternal
employment variable(s) would indicate whether maternal employment is positively or negatively
associated with children’s school outcomes. In the ordinary least squares regression models, we
regress child c’s GPA in year t on the mother m’s employment status during the child’s first
three or 15 years of life, and various control variables (X) for the child and mother:
(1) Yc,m,t = β0 + β1Hm,15 + β2Xc + β3Xm + β4Incomem + εc,m,t
We report results where H is either a continuous variable measuring a mother’s average hours
worked per week over the 15-year period, or a set of variables measuring the percentage of the
15 years a mother spent working fewer than 10 hours a week, between 10 and 19 hours, between
20 and 29 hours, and 30 or more hours. We also report a similar set of results using a mother’s

17

work hours in her child’s first three years of life. Standard errors are clustered by household to
account for the fact that our data contain siblings.
There are advantages and disadvantages of using a child’s grades at age 15 as the
outcome measure. If a mother’s employment decisions are associated with a child’s grades in
9th grade, then these employment decisions are also likely to affect the child’s lifetime earnings
(Murnane, Willett and Levy 1995). However, it may be difficult to find an association because
many factors other than maternal employment will affect a child’s performance in 9th grade.
Working reduces the amount of time and/or energy a mother can invest in her child’s
wellbeing, but increases the ability to invest financially in her child’s wellbeing. In some
regression specifications we include the mother’s income in year t-1, the year prior to the child’s
birth, in order to control for pre-existing resources the mother has available to invest in the child.
In other analyses, we also include a control for income over the child’s first 15 years (and three
years) in order to account for the fact that a key mechanism through which maternal employment
may influence children is through the additional financial resources such employment brings.
The greatest empirical challenge is that a mother’s ability and education may be
associated both with her work hours, and with her child’s grades in school. On the one hand,
mothers with greater ability and education may achieve higher status jobs with longer work
hours, and also have children with positive educational outcomes (due to differences in genetics,
parenting, or other factors between mothers of different abilities and education). On the other
hand, mothers with lower ability and education may need to work longer hours in order to make
ends meet, and may also have children doing poorly in school. Without controlling for these
potentially unobserved maternal characteristics, β1 is likely to be biased. The sample statistics in
Table 2 confirm that in our data set this challenge is real. Children whose mother averaged more

18

than 30 hours of working per week when the child was under the age of 15 have a 9th grade GPA
that is 0.6 points higher than children whose mother averaged fewer than 10 hours of work per
week.
We address the endogeneity of maternal employment in three different ways. First, we
use the extensive data available from the Danish registers to control for many household and
children’s characteristics that may affect both children’s educational outcomes and maternal
employment decisions. To demonstrate the importance of controlling for a rich set of
characteristics that are unavailable in some data sets, we first present regression results that
control only for birth year and birth month. In subsequent regressions we add the full set of
control variables. The controls include both household and child characteristics: child’s gender,
birth order, mother’s education level, the parents’ immigration status, whether a child was born
prematurely, had low birth weight, or had a chronic health condition when young, and the age of
the mother when the child was born. The third regression also includes the mother’s income in
the year prior to the child’s birth as an additional control for the mother’s ability.
Our second method of addressing the endogeneity of maternal employment is to
instrument for a mother’s hours worked in year t with the unemployment rate in her municipality
in the prior year among women with her education level. This approach is similar to that of
Greve (2011), who uses the Danish register data to examine the effect of maternal employment
on child obesity. She shows that a woman’s employment status in 1999 (when the children in
her sample are three years old) is negatively correlated with the unemployment rate in her
municipality. Before a municipal merger reform in 2007 reducing the number of Danish
municipalities to 98, Denmark consisted of 271 municipalities, and the unemployment rate
ranged from 2.2 to 11.0 across municipalities in 1999. Because we examine employment

19

decisions for 15 years, we first calculate the average female unemployment rate in a woman’s
municipality, stratified by education level, over the 15-year period when her child(ren) were
under the age of 16. In the first stage of a two-stage-least-squares regression, we regress a
woman’s average hours worked per week over the 15-year period on the average unemployment
rate in her municipality (for women with the same education level), along with the other
controls. 6
The gender- and education-specific unemployment rate in a municipality should affect
whether women receive job offers and/or the wages offered conditional on a job offer.
Identification in the IV model comes from variation in hours worked due to variation in the
gender- and education-specific unemployment rate across markets (when municipality fixed
effects are omitted) and across time, and thus to variation in employment opportunities and
wages. As we show below, the instrument is negatively correlated with the endogenous variable,
average hours worked, and highly significant statistically.
The key identifying assumption is that variation in the female unemployment rate across
municipalities and within municipalities over time does not directly affect children’s subsequent
GPAs, controlling for our rich set of child and household characteristics, other than through the
effect on female labor supply. Bernal (2008) makes a similar assumption. One concern is that
municipalities with high unemployment rates may have low-quality schools, and thus low
student GPAs, due to reduced tax revenues and reduced education funding or due to unobserved
characteristics of parents and children who live in such locations. This is not likely to be as great
a concern in Denmark as it would be in the United States in that, although local tax revenues are
an important financing source for education, at a national level, Denmark provides large federal
6

For women who live in different municipalities over this time period, we use the relevant unemployment rate for
each municipality-year.

20

transfers from rich to poor localities. Furthermore, the female unemployment rate has a smaller
impact on local finances than the male unemployment rate, which we do not use directly in the
estimation. Despite the high female labor supply, Denmark has one the most gender-segregated
labor markets in the world (Agustin 2011), with women concentrated in relatively low wage day
care and teaching. Therefore, we expect the male labor market to exert greater influence on local
budgets and school quality than does the female labor market.
Nevertheless, in some specifications we include a full set of municipality exposure
variables to account for time-invariant municipality-specific factors that affect student outcomes.
In these specifications the maternal employment coefficients are identified by changes over time
in a municipality’s female, education-specific unemployment rates.
Our third method of addressing the endogeneity of maternal employment is to use
maternal fixed effects to control for differences between households in their children’s abilities.
The maternal employment coefficient in this specification is identified by differences between
siblings in a mother’s work intensity. Recall that all women in our sample gave birth to two or
more children between 1987 and 1992. There are a variety of reasons why mothers’ work
intensity may vary across siblings; it is possible that these same reasons are also correlated with
children’s GPA in adolescence. For example, mothers may reduce their work hours for a child
with health problems (Neidell 2000; Ruhm 2004). We address this concern by including
controls for a child’s health status, such as whether he/she had a low birth weight or was
hospitalized early in life for a chronic health condition. To the extent that unobserved child
health variables are important, however, we would expect the maternal employment coefficients
to be biased upward in the maternal fixed effects model.

21

Relative to the IV method, therefore, the maternal fixed effects models provide less
robust evidence of a causal effect of maternal work hours on a child’s subsequent educational
performance. In some of the maternal fixed effects specifications we also perform supplementary
analyses in which we instrument for maternal employment using the municipality- and
education-specific unemployment rate, as discussed above.
Another potential concern is that the employment decisions for women who have two or
more children in a five-year period may differ from those of women who have only one child,
such that the results from the maternal fixed effects model are not generalizable. In Figure 2 we
display the 15-year pattern of employment separately for women with a single child born in our
sample period (at the top) and women with two children born in the sample period (at the bottom
of Figure 2). The employment patterns are similar for both groups of women.
As mentioned, the employment coefficients in the maternal fixed effects regressions are
identified by mothers whose employment patterns differ across their children born between 1987
and 1992. In Table 3A we depict mothers’ employment patterns during the first three years of
their children’s lives for mothers’ older child (rows) and younger child (columns), based on the
continuous work hour variable. About one-third of the women worked an average of 30 hours or
more in both their older and younger children’s first three years, and 11.7 percent of the women
worked fewer than 10 hours on average with both their children. 7 Women generally work
slightly more in the early years of their older child’s life than in the early years of their younger
child’s life. For example, 45.4 percent of women averaged 30+ hours per week in the first three
years of their older child’s life versus 43.5 percent for their younger child. Twenty-two percent

7

Figure 2 understates the amount of variation because, for example, a woman who works 20 to 29 hours in year 1
and 30+ hours in years 2 and 3 with her older child and 30+ hours for all three years with her younger child will
appear in the bottom right cell in Panel A of Table 2. That is, due to averaging work hours across multiple years,
some women with variation in work hours appear on the diagonal.

22

of the women in Table 3A decreased their average hours between their older child’s and younger
child’s early years, whereas 16.9 percent increased their average hours with the younger child. A
total of 40% of mothers differed in their work hours across siblings’ first three years of life. A
similar pattern emerges in Table 3B, which shows variation across siblings in maternal work
hours across the first 15 years of childhood. Here, more mothers work 30 or more hours per
week with both siblings (44%), and fewer work 0-9 hours per week (6%). A total of 32% of
mothers differed in their work hours across siblings’ first 15 years of life.
VI. Results
We now turn to results of analyses linking maternal work hours to child GPA at age 15.
Coefficient estimates from the ordinary least squares regressions are reported in Table 4. In the
first four columns we examine the association between maternal employment in a child’s first
three years and the child’s GPA at age 15; in the remaining columns we examine the association
between maternal employment in a child’s first 15 years and the child’s GPA at age 15. First we
report regression results that include a set of variables measuring the percentage of the child’s
first three years that a woman spent working between 10 and 19, 20 to 29 hours, and 30 or more
hours per week relative to the omitted category (percentage of years working fewer than 10
hours per week, including nonwork). This specification allows for a non-linear effect of work
hours on children’s outcomes. When we only include birth-year and birth-month fixed effects in
column one, the coefficients measuring the percentage of the child’s first three years that a
woman spent working between 10 and 19, 20 to 29 hours, and 30 or more hours per week are all
positive and significant relative to the omitted category (percentage of years working fewer than
10 hours per week). The coefficients on the three employment variables increase monotonically
as average hours increase.

23

In the second column of Table 4 we include the full set of control variables previously
described. The results indicate that working 10-19 hours per week while a child is under four
years of age is associated with a 0.18-point increase in child GPA at age 15, compared to
working less than 10 hours per week. The coefficients on the percentage of time working 20-29
hours and 30 or more hours per week have a similar magnitude. The inclusion of the control
variables in column two has substantially decreased the employment coefficients. The
magnitude of the association between work hours and GPA is relatively small. The mean GPA
in the sample is 8.27, suggesting that the child of a woman who worked 10-19 hours per week
while the child was under the age of four would be predicted to have a GPA 2.1 percent higher
than an otherwise similar child whose mother worked less than 10 hours per week. In Appendix
1 we report coefficient estimates for the full set of control variables that are not reported in Table
4.
In the third column of Table 4, we include a measure of the mother’s income one year
prior to the year of birth. Although the coefficient on this variable is positive and significant,
including it does not change the coefficients on maternal work hours. In unreported regressions
we replace this variable with a measure of a mothers’ average income during the child’s first
three years (or first 15 years), and the results are qualitatively similar to those reported in column
three. 8 In column four we include a linear hours worked variable in order to facilitate
comparisons to the IV specifications discussed below 9.

8

Results are available from the authors by request.
We also performed analyses including a continuous measure of the average number of hours per week mother
worked while her child was under the age of four, as well as a quadratic hours-worked term. The coefficient on a
mother’s average hours worked per week was positive, significantly different from zero, and indicates that an
additional hour worked per week between ages zero and three is associated with a 0.0065-point increase in a child’s
GPA in adolescence. The predicted magnitude of working 15 hours per week is about 50 percent smaller compared
to the specification in column two.
9

24

In the final four columns of Table 4 we present results from a similar set of regressions
that includes a mother’s employment history over the child’s first 15 years of life rather the first
three years. The coefficients on maternal work hours remain positive and significant, and the
magnitudes are larger than when examining maternal employment only in the first three years,
suggesting that the effect of maternal employment accumulates for many years over a child’s
life, rather than being focused only on a child’s first few years.
In column six of Table 4, which includes a full set of control variables, the results show
that the percentage of time a mother worked 10-19, 20-29, and 30+ hours per week over the
child’s lifetime are associated with a 0.50, 0.43 and a 0.32-point increase in the child’s GPA at
age 15, respectively, compared to working less than 10 hours per week. In both columns 6 and
7, child GPA at age 15 is significantly higher when mothers work 10-19 hours per week
compared to when she works 30 or more hours per week. A child of a woman who worked
between 10 and 19 hours per week is predicted to have a 6.0 percent higher GPA relative to the
child of a woman who worked fewer than 10 hours per week. As in the first set of regressions,
the maternal employment coefficients are considerably smaller when we include detailed
characteristics of the child and mother. And as with the 3-year employment analysis, including a
mother’s pre-birth income does not substantially change the magnitude of the maternal
employment coefficients, nor does including a woman’s average income received while the child
is under the age of 16 (results not shown). In the final column we include a continuous average
hours-worked variable.
We next present results in Table 5 from the two-stage least squares models in which we
instrument for a woman’s work hours with the female, education-specific unemployment rate in

25

her municipality during the first three or 15 years of her child’s life. 10 The full set of control
variables is included in all of the Table 5 specifications. The local unemployment rate is
assumed to affect a child’s GPA solely through its impact on a woman’s labor supply decisions.
In each of the six first-stage regressions, the coefficient on the local unemployment rate is
negative as expected and significant, and the F-statistics are very large. A one-percentage point
increase in the female, education-specific unemployment rate in a woman’s locality is associated
with a decrease of about 0.05 hours worked per week.
The second-stage maternal employment coefficients are positive, significant, and in the
first three columns, are about three times larger than the coefficients from the comparable OLS
specifications reported in Table 4. In the first column of Table 5, each additional hour per week
of maternal employment during the first three years of a child’s life is associated with a 0.015point increase in a child’s 9th grade GPA. The child of a woman who worked an average of 15
hours per week while the child was under the age of four is predicted to have a GPA that is 0.22
points (or 2.6 percent) higher than an otherwise similar child whose mother did not work at all.
Adding a mother’s pre-birth income in the second column of Table 5 has little effect on the
maternal employment coefficient.
In column three we estimate an IV regression where we include a set of variables
recording the proportion of a child’s first three years or first 15 years that he/she spent in each
municipality. If women (and their children) never moved, this would be equivalent to including
a full set of municipality fixed effects, in which case the effect of maternal employment would
be identified by within-municipality changes over time in the female- and education-specific
unemployment rates. Including the municipality variables allows a child’s performance in

Because we lag the unemployment rate one year, we actually use the year prior to the child’s birth plus the first
two years, and so forth for the 15-year analysis.

26

school to be affected by municipality-specific factors, such as educational quality, and allows
this effect to be proportional to the amount of time a child spent in each municipality. The
maternal employment coefficient in column three is significantly different from zero and is
slightly larger than the coefficients in the first two columns.
In the final three columns of Table 5 we report the IV results when analyzing women’s
employment histories over their children’s first 15 years of life. As with the OLS results, the
maternal employment coefficients are about two times larger in the 15-year versus the three-year
time period. Based on the specification in column four of Table 5, the child of a woman who
worked an average of 15 hours per week while the child was under the age of 16 would be
predicted to have a GPA 0.51 points (6.2 percent) higher than an otherwise similar child whose
mother did not work at all.
The estimated maternal employment coefficients in the IV models are larger than the
OLS estimates. This may be because the IV model estimates a Local Average Treatment Effect
(LATE), capturing the effect of maternal employment only for children of the “compliers” -women whose labor supply decisions were affected by the female-, education-specific
unemployment rate in their localities. This measured effect is not necessarily the same as the
effect for women whose labor supply decisions were not affected by the local unemployment
rate, perhaps because their job offers were not affected by incremental changes in labor demand,
or because they had very high reservation wages. Additionally, in Table 2 we show that women
who work 30 or more hours per week when their child is less than 16 years old are better
educated, have healthier children at birth, and had a higher income before a child’s birth than
women who work fewer hours. If the former women and their children also have unobserved
characteristics that improve a child’s educational performance relative to the latter group of

27

women and their children, then one would expect the IV maternal employment coefficients to be
smaller than the OLS coefficients, and perhaps even negative. The pattern that we actually
observe indicates that selection appears to work in the opposite direction: conditional on the
observed characteristics, women who work a relatively large number of hours appear to have
unfavorable unobserved attributes with respect to their children’s future educational
performance. However, if the effect of maternal employment varies across families, differences
between the OLS and IV coefficients would not necessarily address the presence or direction of
selection bias. That is, with heterogeneous treatment effects, the coefficients may differ due to
differences in the populations for which the effect is estimated.
We report coefficient estimates from the maternal fixed effects regressions in Table 6.
The full set of control variables for children and time-varying variables for mothers are included
in all of the Table 6 specifications. In the first two columns, the coefficients on the percentage of
time a woman spent working between 10-19 hours per week when her child was under the age of
four are positive and significant, whereas the coefficients on the percentage of time working 2029 and 30 or more hours per week are insignificant. The magnitude of the association is about
one-third that of the OLS estimate from Table 4: the child of a woman working 10-19 hours per
week while the child was under the age of four would be predicted to have a GPA 0.7 percent
higher than another child in the same family where the mother worked less than 10 hours per
week. The maternal employment coefficient is insignificant in column three when we use a
continuous measure of the average number of hours per week a mother worked while her child
was under the age of four. 11

11

In analyses not shown, we instrumented for a woman’s work hours with the gender, education-specific
unemployment rate in her municipality. In this specification, the coefficient is identified by variations in the labor
market conditions a woman faces between adjacent births and the employment coefficient is insignificant. In these

28

In the remaining columns of Table 6 we report the maternal fixed effects results when
analyzing women’s employment histories over their children’s first 15 years of life. The
coefficients on both the percentage of time a woman spent working 10 to 19 and 20 to 29 hours
per week are positive and significant, whereas the coefficient for 30 or more hours is not
significantly different from zero. The magnitude of the first two coefficients are about 50
percent smaller than in the comparable OLS specifications, as reported in column seven of Table
4. As before, the maternal employment coefficients are insignificant in column six of Table 6
when we use a continuous measure of the average number of hours per week a mother worked
while her child was under the age of 16. 12
In Table 7 we report coefficient estimates on the maternal employment variable when we
stratify the sample by education, examining whether a woman has less than a high school degree
(low education) or a high school degree or more (high education). Results are reported
separately for the OLS, IV, and maternal fixed effects models. 13 The maternal employment
coefficients in the maternal fixed effects models when using a continuous hours worked variable
are generally insignificant when stratifying by education, just as they are for the sample as a
whole. In the OLS models, the maternal employment coefficients when stratifying by education
are similar in magnitude to the full-sample coefficients. In the IV models, however, the maternal
employment coefficients are larger for more educated mothers.
VII. Conclusions
In this paper we estimate the causal effect of maternal employment on children’s
educational outcomes using three different methods. Using detailed data from the Danish
analyses, the first-stage F-statistic (4.9) is substantially smaller than in the Table 5 regressions, indicating that the
instrument is weaker when including maternal fixed effects.
12
The first-stage F-statistic is 33.0.
13
The sample size for the entire sample exceeds the sum of the sample sizes of the low-education and higheducation sub-samples because we omit women who are missing education information.

29

administrative registers on over 130,000 children born between 1987 and 1992, we examine the
association between a child’s grade point average in ninth grade and his/her mother’s
employment status and work hours during the first three years of the child’s life, and separately
during the first 15 years of the child’s life.
Overall, several patterns emerge. The OLS, IV, and maternal fixed effects models
produce a consistent set of results indicating that maternal employment is associated with an
increase in children’s grades. These effects are strongest for women working 10-19 hours per
week. In the IV specification, for example, the child of a woman who worked between 10 and
19 hours per week while her child was under the age of four is predicted to have a GPA that is
2.6 percent higher than an otherwise similar child whose mother did not work at all.
The analysis also indicates that the positive coefficient on maternal employment does not
appear to be driven by increased maternal earnings. This result is consistent with many U.S.
studies and suggests that rather than being attributable to the additional resources mothers’ bring
into the household, maternal employment influences children’s cognitive development through
other channels. Although our data set is not well-suited to test the possible mechanisms, possible
explanations include increased access to social support among employed mothers, improved
mental well-being among mothers who work, and access to high-quality child care. Future work
is needed to better understand the mechanisms that may link maternal employment to improved
child outcomes.
The magnitude of the effect of maternal employment differs across the three models, with
the maternal fixed effects model producing the smallest and the IV model the largest estimates.
A key point, however, is that in none of the three models presented here do we find evidence of a
negative association between maternal employment and children’s grades. These results stand in

30

contrast to a series of recent studies that use data from the U.S., Europe, and Canada and report
no association or a small, negative association between maternal employment and children’s
cognitive development.
The beneficial effect of maternal employment is larger when examining a mother’s full
15-year work history versus employment in a child’s first three years only. This stands in
contrast to other work in the U.S. context, which has found that employment in the earliest years
of life are more strongly (and negatively) associated with child cognitive outcomes than later
employment (Ruhm 2008; Baum 2003; Brooks-Gunn, Han and Waldfogel 2002; Hill,
Waldfogel, Brooks-Gunn, and Han 2005). Our results, in contrast, suggest a cumulative
association between maternal employment and child GPA, such that it is the accumulation of
maternal employment experiences over childhood that matters most (and in a positive direction)
for children’s success in school.
In the OLS and maternal fixed effects models, the beneficial effect of maternal
employment was larger for women working 10-19 hours per week than 20-29 or 30+ hours per
week. This is similar to several studies using U.S. data, which find that children’s cognitive
outcomes are highest when mothers work part-time (Brooks-Gunn, Han and Waldfogel 2002;
Ruhm 2008; Hill, Waldfogel, Brooks-Gunn, and Han 2005) typically defined as around 25 hours
per week.
We also find evidence that the beneficial impact of maternal employment on children’s
educational outcomes is stronger among more advantaged households. This differs from a
previous study using Swedish data, which find that maternity leave (or non-employment in the
earliest years) is associated with improved outcomes only for children of higher-educated
mothers (Liu and Skans 2010) and U.S. results showing that the detrimental effects of maternal

31

employment concentrated among children of more educated mothers (Ruhm 2008). One
explanation for this might have to do with the quality of care that children experience when their
mothers work. As noted above, the U.S. invests much less in child care quality than does
Denmark. It is possible that, for more advantaged U.S. mothers, time at work means that a child
substitutes time in enriching home environments for time in lower-quality child care (see Ruhm
2008). Denmark, in contrast, invests a great deal in child care; perhaps there time spent in day
care may not differ from the quality of time spent at home for more educated mothers, meaning
that other factors may come into play to explain the greater benefits of maternal work for
children of more educated mothers. This could include the quality of jobs held by more educated
mothers; previous work has shown benefits for children when mothers are employed in more
cognitively demanding jobs (Johnson, Kalil and Dunifon 2012). Perhaps more educated
mothers, whose jobs may be most enriching, reap the psychological, social or other benefits of
employment in ways that benefit their children.
This paper has some limitations that should be noted. As discussed above, we are not
able to shed light on the channels through which maternal employment improves children’s
school outcomes. While the Danish register data has several advantages, particularly its large
sample size, it does not contain information on family processes and other factors that may
account for the associations we observe. Additionally, we are forced to infer women’s work
hours from their tax payments. As noted above, comparisons between our assumptions and
direct assessments of women’s work hours from survey data increase our confidence in these
inferences; however, a possibility remains that, for some women, work hours are mis-measured.
Taken together, however, this paper presents evidence of a positive causal linkage
between maternal work hours and the GPA of Danish teens. These associations are strongest

32

when mothers work part-time, and among more advantaged mothers, and are not accounted for
by mothers’ earnings. In some ways, these findings diverge from the larger body of work linking
maternal employment to child outcomes, most of which finds neutral, or small negative
associations between maternal work hours and child cognitive development. It is not clear
whether our divergent findings are due to the unique situation faced by working mothers in
Denmark, which may be more supportive of maternal employment and therefore promote
improved child well-being, or whether our findings differ from other studies for sampling or
other methodological reasons. Of the previous econometric work in this area, only one
(Rasmussen 2010) used Danish data; that study focused only on maternal employment in the
earliest weeks of life, while the current study examined a much longer time window. More
work is needed to better understand how and why the influence of maternal employment on
children may differ in cross-national contexts. However, the current study provides strong
evidence, across multiple models, that, for Danish women, maternal employment is associated
with improved outcomes for children.

Notes: Each cell in the second and fifth columns reports the coefficient on the average hours per
week a mother worked during her child’s first three or 15 years of life from a separate regression.
The dependent variable is a child's GPA in 9th grade (mean is 8.27). Low education is defined
as less than high school; high education is defined as high school or more. The IV coefficients
are from the model that does not include municipality fixed effects. When stratifying by gender
of the child, we include women who had girls only and (separately) women who had boys only.
