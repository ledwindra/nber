Such attribution places runs and panics outside of the realm of scientific inquiry. Alternatively, in this paper I define the notion of a run as a discontinuous shift in portfolio asset holdings brought about by a belief in the end of the price fixing regime. I also argue that runs are foreseeable events and employ the current difficulties of S & L's to serve as an extended example which emphasizes such predictability.\n\n",
