Which Social Cost of Carbon? A Theoretical Perspective

JEL No. Q00,Q4,Q5,Q58
ABSTRACT
This paper develops a theoretical foundation for the social cost of carbon (SCC). The model
highlights the source of debate over whether countries should use the global or domestic SCC for
regulatory impact analysis. I identify conditions under which a country's decision to internalize
the global SCC, as currently practiced in the United States, is individually rational. Nevertheless,
I show how obtaining international consensus on a particular value will be more challenging than
often appreciated. I introduce the notion of "strategic SCC" to reflect each country's preference
for a globally internalized shadow value on emissions conditional on a true value of the global
SCC and a distribution of the domestic SCCs among countries. While all countries have a
strategic SCC greater than their domestic SCC, a country's strategic SCC can be greater than or
less than the global SCC. How these preferences translate into agreement depends on institutional
arrangements for collective decision-making, for which I provide empirical evidence based on
various decision rules. A central contribution of the paper is demonstration of the need for more
research on the theoretical underpinnings of the SCC for policy analysis, because establishing and
using the SCC among sovereign countries is not simply an application of estimating and
internalizing an externality.

Introduction

Individual agents across the planet have little or no incentive to internalize the
global costs of their own climate-changing emissions. From this perspective, the
problem of climate change is the problem of a global externality. The social
cost of carbon (SCC) is a concept that reects the marginal external costs of
emissions: it represents the monetized damage caused by each additional unit of
carbon dioxide, or the carbon equivalent of another greenhouse gas, emitted into
the atmosphere. Many countriesthe United States, Canada, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdomhave
begun accounting for the SCC in regulatory impact analyses of domestic policy.
In doing so, these countries take into account the global bene ts of reducing
CO2 emissions (i.e., avoided damages worldwide) when conducting bene t-cost
analyses of domestic regulations.1
There is, however, growing debate about whether the global SCC is appropriate for bene t-cost analysis of domestic policy. The practice is justi ed on
the basis that climate change is a unique problem because of its scale as a global
externality; that application of the global SCC among all countries would lead
to globally e¢cient emissions; and that climate policy takes place in the context
of international relations where one countrys actions are used to leverage those
of others, and no one country can solve the problem of climate change alone
(Interagency Working Group 2010; Greenstone et al., 2013; Pizer et al. 2014).
The other side of the debate emphasizes that using global bene ts is a departure
from the conventional practice of regulatory impact analysis, especially in the
United States, where bene t-cost analysis has focused traditionally on comparing domestic bene ts and costs (Dudley and Mannix 2014; Gayer and Viscusi
2015; Darmstadter 2016; Fraas et al. 2016). The critics argue that unilateral
policy for any one country should account for only the domestic share of the
SCC, and that broadening the scope to include global bene ts has potentially
far reaching implications for the (mis)allocation of societal resources.2 Questions
1
Currently, the United States uses a central estimate of $40 per metric ton of CO2 emitted
in 2015 (in 2014$s), with increasing numbers for each year thereafter (Interagency Working
Group 2013). In an important application of the SCC, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) estimates global bene ts of $20 billion per year by 2030 from the Clean Power
Plan to regulate emissions from existing power plants (U.S. EPA 2014).
2
Aldy (2015) provides a useful discussion about the importance of the SCC for both implementing and evaluating climate policy.

1

also arise about consistency with individual rationality (i.e., self interest) from
any one countrys perspective.
Despite the widespread use of the SCC for evaluating climate policy, and the
emerging debate about its appropriate scope, there is surprisingly little research
on the theoretical basis of the SCC and how it should be used for policy analysis.
The existing literature focuses almost exclusively on producing empirical estimates and re ning the underlying methods employed in integrated assessment
models (IAMs). This paper, in contrast, develops a theoretical foundation for
the SCC to highlight points of disagreement in the debate over whether countries
should use the global or domestic SCC. Moreover, I identify conditions under
which a countrys decision to internalize the global SCC is individually rational,
yet also show how obtaining international consensus on a particular value of the
global SCC will be more challenging than often appreciated.
The next section begins with the basic setup of a static model where each country chooses its emissions policy, recognizing that aggregate emissions generate a
global public bad. The setup makes immediately clear the distinction between
global and domestic de nitions of the SCC. A useful feature of the model is the
way it clari es how emissions produce a global externality from the perspective
of individual agents, but a global public bad from the perspective of countries.
Analysis in Section 3 shows how internalizing the global SCC is consistent with
Pareto optimality of global emissions, and internalizing the domestic SCC is consistent with a Nash equilibrium among countries on their choice of emissions. I
then use the model in Section 4 to show potential distributional e¤ects of moving
from equilibrium to e¢cient emissions, along with suggestive empirical evidence
based on the regional calibration in the C-DICE model (Nordhaus 2015).
Section 5 moves directly to questions about individual rationality and a countrys choice of internalizing the global or domestic SCC. I extend the basic model
in two ways to account for the real-world institutional context where climate
policy and international negotiations take place. First, building on the international relations argument for leadership and leverage, I replace the assumption of
Nash behavior among countries with conjectures about how other countries will
respond to ones own choice of emissions. Second, taking account of the dynamic
way that countries will make emission decisions over time, I extend the static
setup of the model to a repeated game and consider basic Folk theorem results.
Both modeling approaches show that a countrys choice to internalize the global

2

SCC can be individually rational. The results provide what is to the best of
my knowledge the rst formally derived microeconomic justi cation for countries
to internalize the global SCC, and the necessary conditions are informative for
policy design.
But on what value of the global SCC should we expect countries to agree?
From an economics perspective, the SCC is generally perceived as an objective
parameter, the estimates of which are limited primarily by empirical methods
and data availability.3 For political purposes, however, seeking the one right
estimate of the global SCC fails to recognize strategic incentives on the part
of countries. In Section 6, I introduce the notion of strategic SCC to reect
each countrys preference for a globally internalized shadow value on emissions
conditional on a true value of the global SCC and on a distribution of the domestic
SCCs among countries. While all countries have a strategic SCC greater than
their domestic SCC, a countrys strategic SCC can be greater than or less than
the global SCC. How these preferences translate into agreement therefore depends
on institutional arrangements for collective decision-making, for which I provide
some empirical evidence based again on the C-DICE model and various decision
rules. I also discuss immediate implications of the results for debates currently
underway in multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank, about how to
account for climate-change impacts in program evaluation.
In the nal section, I conclude the paper with a summary of the main results
and policy implications. A central nding is that internalizing the global SCC
when setting domestic policy or conducting regulatory impact analysis can be
in a countrys own self interest. This builds support for current practice in the
United States and other countries. There is, however, a need for more research
on the theoretical basis of the SCC and its use for policy analysis. The analysis
here demonstrates how establishing and using the global SCC among sovereign
nations is not simply an application of estimating and internalizing an externality.

The Model Setup

I construct the simplest model possible to illustrate the key ideas. Countries are
indexed i = 1; :::; n with n  2. Each country has emissions xi , and the initial
3

With the exception of necessary (and important) assumptions about the discount rate, we
might consider estimates of the SCC to be the result of positive rather than normative analysis.

3

P
version of the model is static.4 The aggregate level of emissions, X = ni=1 xi =
xi + X i , is a global public bad. This means that emissions anywhere on the
planet a¤ect all countries, and I assume the impact on each country is negative.
The damages of emissions in country i are Di (X) = i X, where i > 0, and the
linearity assumption is made for simplicity. The bene ts of emissions in country
i are Bi (xi ), where Bi0 (xi ) > 0 and Bi00 (xi ) < 0.
A few observations are useful about the country-level speci cation of damage
and bene t functions. The damage function for each country can be written as
consisting of two terms, Di (X) = i X i + i xi . The rst term reects the damage
in country i from emissions in all other countries. The second term reects the
damage in country i from its own emissions. While the damages with a domestic
origin are internal to the country, they are external to individual agents within
the country. Internalizing domestic damages from domestic emissions therefore
requires some form of government intervention. The interventions can be either
quantity- or price-based. A quantity-based policy would set xi in ways consistent
with, for example, direct regulation or a cap-and-trade program. A price-based
policy would set a per-unit price pi on emissions (e.g., a carbon tax) that would
determine a countrys emissions according to xi (pi ) = fxi : Bi0 (xi ) = pi g, which
represents each countrys demand for emissions.
The simple setup of this model makes immediately clear the di¤erences between two notions of the social cost of carbon:
De nition 1 (DSCC) The Domestic Social Cost of Carbon is

i

De nition 2 (GSCC) The Global Social Cost of Carbon is A =

for all i.
Pn

i=1

i.

Both the DSCC and the GSCC provide a measure of monetized, marginal damages from emissions, but di¤er in their political and therefore geographic scope.
The DSCC measures the marginal damages to each country individually, whereas
the GSCC measures the global marginal damages, which are the sum of the
DSCCs across all countries.
Most of the empirical evidence on the GSCC comes from IAMs. Although
IAMs are not without critics (Pindyck 2013, 2015), they provide the leading approach among researchers and policymakers for estimating the GSCC (Metcalf
4

The one-period version of the model can be interpreted as a single long period or extended
to reect a repeated game with a constant payo¤ structure, as in Section 5.2.

4

and Stock, 2015). Indeed, the U.S. estimates of the GSCC used in regulatory
impact assessment are based on a synthesis analysis of three di¤erent IAMs (Interagency Working Group 2013).5 The central estimate of the GSCC, based on
a 3-percent discount rate, is $40 (in 2014$s) per metric ton of CO2 emitted in
2015, with the number increasing in future years.
As the IAMs have become more detailed over time, greater e¤orts have been
made to increase the spatial resolution of costs and bene ts. Speci cally, several
models calculate estimates of the DSCC for di¤erent countries, or in most cases
regions. Nordhaus (2014) summarizes the regional SCC estimates for di¤erent
models and observes that while there is little consensus on the distribution of the
GSCC by region, no one region or country appears to dominate the total. Subsequently, Nordhaus (2015) merges the results to derive a regional decomposition of
the GSCC based on an average of three models.6 I report the distribution in Figure 1 to provide a sense of the empirical heterogeneity in the DSCC, recognizing
that some estimates are for regions rather than countries. The estimates range
from nearly 14 percent of the GSCC for the European Union to less than 1 percent for South Africa. The gure also illustrates how the percentage distribution
partitions the GSCC of $40 among di¤erent countries or regions.7 For example,
the United States share is about $4.24. Across the distribution, Nordhaus (2015)
observes that the estimates are roughly proportional to discounted Gross Domestic Products (GDPs), with deviations based on geographic di¤erences in climate
sensitivity.

E¢ciency vs. Equilibrium

I now consider how the di¤erent measures of the social cost of carbonthe GSCC
and the DSCCsrelate to globally e¢cient and equilibrium levels of emissions
policy. I begin with globally e¢ciency and the GSCC, before turning to equilibrium policies and the DSCCs. To simultaneously account for quantity- or
price-based policies, I consider the shadow value on emissions, denoted si , that
5

The three di¤erent models are DICE, FUND, and PAGE. Detailed reference information
is available in the Interagency Working Group report.

See Table B-2 in the Online Appendix in Nordhaus (2015)
7
The estimated percentage decomposition of the GSCC into countries and regions is based
on a GSCC of around $20 (Nordhaus 2015). The percentages reported in Figure 1 assume the
same percentages hold for a GSCC of $40.

5

Figure 1: Heterogeneity in the distribution of the GSCC across countries or
regions based on averaging across three IAMs

each country internalizes. The choice of si maps into a quantity-based instrument according to the demand function for emissions xi (si ) and directly into a
price-based instrument with si = pi .

3.1

Pareto Optimality

Pareto optimality in global emissions must maximize aggregate surplus. The
e¢ciency objective is to coordinate the internalized, shadow value of emissions
among all countries to solve

Assuming an interior solution (here and throughout), the conditions that de ne
the solution (s1 ; :::; sn ) can be combined as follows:
B10 (x1 (s1 )) = ::: = Bn0 (xi (si )) = A.

6

(2)

The result is intuitive: the marginal bene t of emissions is equated across all
countries and equal to the sum of the marginal damages of emissions. Using
each countrys demand function for emissions, it is straightforward to see the
further implication that satisfying (2) requires si = A for all i. That is, all
countries must internalize the GSCC, which then de nes a unique level of Pareto
optimal emissions for each country xi = xi (si ) and thus aggregate emissions,
Pn 
X =
i=1 xi . This, of course, is the e¢ciency argument in support of all
countries internalizing the GSCC for domestic policy.
Although a bit of an aside, it is worth pointing out that the e¢ciency conditions in (2) are related to, and yet distinct from, the standard condition for
optimal provision of a public good (bad). The classic Samuelson condition would
equate the sum of the marginal bene ts of reducing the public bad to the marginal
costs of doing so. In this case, the sum of the marginal bene ts corresponds to
A, but, in contrast to the Samuelson condition, these marginal bene ts equal the
marginal costs of reducing emissions (foregone bene ts) in all countries, which
themselves must all be equal. The di¤erence arises here because the marginal
costs of abatement come from sources within each country separately rather than
from a uniform price or market supply curve. This is why there are n conditions
in (2) rather than the single Samuelson condition.

3.2

Nash Equilibrium

I now turn to the problem that each country faces based on its own self interest.
While Pareto optimal emissions maximize aggregate surplus, individual countries
are focused on maximizing their own net bene ts. I begin with the Nash assumption whereby each country takes the emissions (policy) of others as given. Each
countrys problem can be written as
max Bi (xi (si ))

i

si

[xi (si ) + X i ] :

(3)

The important feature of this objective function is that each country accounts
for its DSCC from global emissions rather than the GSCC. The unique solution
s^i will solve
(4)
Bi0 (xi (^
si )) = i for all i.

7

Figure 2: Example where the choice of the DSCC over the GSCC is consistent
with a classic prisoners dilemma

In this case, each countrys demand for emissions implies that s^i = i for all
i.8 That is, each country chooses to internalize its DSCC, implying domestic
^ = Pn x^i .
emissions levels x^i = xi (^
si ) for all i and global emissions X
i=1
It is straightforward to see that equilibrium emissions are ine¢ciently high
in all countries. This follows immediately from the facts that si = A > i = s^i
and x0i (si ) < 0 for all i. The result also follows intuitively because emissions
provide a global public bad, the marginal damages of which no one country has
the incentive to fully internalize with the setup in (3). In other words, every
country has an incentive to free ride rather than internalize more than its own
costs.
It is worth noting that the characterization of a global public bad di¤ers
somewhat from a global externality, and this is due the level of analysis taking
place among countries rather than individuals. The standard de nition of an
externality means that agents take no account of any external damages of their
actions. But here each country experiences some of the marginal damages from
its own emissions, in addition to damages from the emissions of other countries.
This explains why countries will, to some extent, constrain their own equilibrium
emissions with a choice of si > 0, rather than si = 0, which would have emissions
increase until Bi0 (xi ) = 0. Nevertheless, individual agents within each country
do not have such an incentive because they experience an in nitesimally small
fraction of damages from their own emissions.
Figure 2 illustrates the idea of free riding on abatement in the form of a
8
Notice that each countrys choice of s^i and therefore x
^i depends on i but not X i . This is
an important implication of the assumed linearity of damage functions. While the assumption
simpli es the analysis greatly, it should be recognized that, more generally, each countrys
choice would be a best-response function that depends on the emissions of other countries.

classic prisoners dilemma. There are n = 2 identical countries, and each faces
the choice of internalizing its DSCC or the GSCC. In this example, both countries
are better o¤ if they both choose the GSCC (the Pareto optimal solution), but
doing so is not a Nash equilibrium. The payo¤s are such that both countries have
a dominant strategy to choose the DSCC, resulting in a Nash equilibrium where
both countries obtain a lower payo¤.

4

Distributional Considerations

It is well recognized that the globally e¢cient level of emissions is not an equilibrium. Generally less well known is that all countries would not necessarily prefer
the e¢cient level of emissions, even if it could be sustained. Figure 3 modi es
the payo¤s to the prisoners dilemma to illustrate a simple example. Pareto optimality occurs if both countries choose the GSCC, were the combined payo¤s
are maximized, but the Nash equilibrium still occurs when both countries choose
their respective DSCC. The di¤erence arises now because Country B is actually worse o¤ at the Pareto optimal outcome compared to the Nash equilibrium.
Without a transfer from Country A to Country B (of at least one unit of payo¤),
the problem is one of distribution in addition to free riding.
I now consider more generally the potential distributional e¤ects upon moving
from equilibrium to e¢cient emissions. Let us de ne the respective net bene ts



^
for each country as v^i = Bi (^
xi )
i X . Hence the task
i X and vi = Bi (xi )
is to consider di¤erent circumstances under which it is possible for vi v^i R 0.
The simplest and most intuitive case is that of all identical countries because
the e¢cient level of emissions will always Pareto dominate the equilibrium. By
9

Figure 4: A countrys net bene ts at Pareto optimal and Nash equilibrium emissions with n identical countries

symmetry, each country will have same level of equilibrium emissions and the
same level of Pareto optimal emissions. We can therefore dispense with subscripts

where the inequality follows because x^ > x , n = B 0 (x ) by (2), and B 00 (x) < 0.
In other words, for each country, the avoided damages of lower global emissions
(the rst term) more than o¤set the foregone bene ts of further reducing its own
emissions (the second term). Figure 4 illustrates the result graphically. The
result is also quite intuitive upon recognizing that maximizing the sum of net
bene ts among identical countries is equivalent to maximizing the net bene t for
each individual country.
There is, however, no such general result with heterogenous countries. The

where the signs of the di¤erent parts of the expression follow because x^i > xi for
xi ) = i by (4), and Bi00 (xi ) < 0. The important observation is
all countries, Bi0 (^
that the overall sign of (8) can be either positive or negative.
Notwithstanding the indeterminate sign, the terms in (8) are useful for building intuition about when a country could be made worse- or better-o¤ upon
moving to the globally e¢cient level of emissions, without transfers. The rst
part of (8), which is positive, represents the spillin bene ts that a country receives from the emission reductions in other countries. The term is bigger when
country i experiences greater marginal damages from emissions and other countries reduce their emissions more. The second braced part of (8) is the net private
cost to country i. The rst term is the bene t of reducing its own emissions, and
the second term is the foregone bene t from reducing emissions. The net e¤ect
is always negative, and the magnitude is increasing in the size of the externality
being internalized, A i ,which follows because xi ! x^i as A i ! 0.
The more general concept underlying these di¤erent possibilities is that moving to a Pareto optimal allocation need not imply a Pareto improvement. It does,
however, imply that a Pareto improvement is possible with transfers. We know
P
P
that ni=1 vi > ni=1 v^i even if it does not hold that vi > v^i for all i. It is therefore possible for redistribution of the surplus such that all countries are at least as
well o¤ as they were in the initial equilibrium. Indeed, the di¤erences vi v^i for
all i can provide a foundation for thinking about climate nance as transfers in an
internal setting. In particular, we know there exists a set of transfers ( 1 ; :::;  n )
P
such that ni=1  i = 0 and vi v^i +  i  0 for all i, holding strictly for at least
some i.
Let us for the moment consider some simulation-based empirical evidence. I
employ the basic set up in Nordhaus (2015) for the C-DICE model, although
I exclude the models club feature. The model includes the 15 countries (or
regions) listed in Figure 1 and the respective DSCCs corresponding with a GSCC
11

Figure 5: Simulated abatement of countries or regions (Panel A) and change
in welfare (Panel B) of moving from equilibrium to Pareto optimal emissions
without transfers

12

of $40. The country bene ts of emissions are based on the functional form and
parameterization in Nordhaus (2015, Table B-4).9 With this setup, I solve for
equilibrium and Pareto optimal emissions for each country and report the results
of interest in Figure 5. Panel A shows each countrys abatement of moving from
equilibrium to Pareto optimal emissions, i.e., x^i xi . Overall emissions decline by
22 percent, and the gure shows the percentage of the total reduction attributable
to each country. For example, 26 percent of the reduction comes from China
and 9 percent from the European Union. Panel B shows the change in welfare
vi v^i measured in billions of dollars. While India gains the most, South Africa,
Eurasia, and China are all made worse o¤ without transfers. Clearly, the net
bene ts exceed costs across all countries.

5

Rationalizing the GSCC

Can it ever be individually rational for a country to internalize more than its
DSCC, perhaps even the GSCC? With the model considered thus far, the question is equivalent to asking whether cooperation in a prisoners dilemma can be
individually rational. The answer, of course, is no, without modi cation to
the models setup. In this section, I show how basic changes to the model that
reect the real-world institutional context where climate policy and international
negotiations take place can produce a di¤erent result. I do not claim that the
models in the following two subsections are necessarily the right ones; rather, my
aim is to illustrate simple possibilities that are consistent with observed policies
and that can spur further theoretical research on this increasingly important,
policy-relevant question.

5.1

Conjectural Variations

We have heretofore assumed Nash behavior among countriesthat is, each country assumes that its choice of si and therefore xi will have no a¤ect on the emissions of other countries. But this assumption ignores the potential importance of
9

The bene ts of emissions are given by Bi (xi ) = qi i 2i qi , where qi is GDP in 2011
xi xi )=
xi is the emissions intensity relative to 2011 levels denoted by x
i . The
and i = (
parameter i is the abatement cost parameter that comes from McKinsey (2009) and averaged
for the 2020 and 2030 estimates. It is straightforward to verify that the bene ts function
i .
satis es the required properties for all xi  x

13

international relations where some countries may reduce their emissions to leverage reductions from other countries. One way to account for this relationship is
to employ a conjectural variations approach.
Assume that country i has a conjecture about how other countries will change
their level of emissions given a change in its own emissions. Here I consider
the choices of xi directly (rather than si ) in order to simplify notation. The
simplest way to characterize the conjecture is with a linear relationship between
country is chosen level of emissions and its expectation about the emissions of
~ i . Speci cally, we can write dX
~ i =dxi = i > 0 to capture
others, denoted X
the way that a country believes a decrease (increase) in its own emissions will
decrease (increase) the emissions of other countries.10 Note that Nash behavior
~ i = i xi + i , where i is
is consistent with i = 0 for all i. It follows that X
some constant of integration.
Each country i then solves
max Bi (xi )
xi

i xi

i ( i xi

+ i );

and the solution will satisfy
Bi0 (xi ) =

i (1

+

i ):

(9)

Comparing this rst-order condition with (4) shows how the positive relationship
~ i means that a country will internalize more than the DSCC
between xi and X
when setting its own emissions policy. The presence of i i on the right-hand
side reects the additional, marginal disincentive to increase emissions: the expectation that other countries will increase their emissions tooby i at a cost of
i . There is also an important knife-edge result where a country will take account
of exactly the GSCC. If i = A i = i , then expression (9) is equivalent to (2) for
country i. In other words, if a country expects a decrease in its own emissions
to decrease that of all others in proportion to the ratio of its external cost of
emissions to its internal costs, then it is individually rational for the country to
internalize the GSCC. Moreover, if the expectation were to hold for all i, then
all countries would internalize the GSCC, and global emissions would be Pareto
optimal.
10

The approach here is based on that in Cornes and Sandler (1984, 1985) for public goods
more generally.

14

It is worth briey mentioning how the conjectural variations solution relates
to other solutions for solving public goods problems. The most noteworthy is
a Lindahl equilibrium. Although often discussed as pertaining to individualized
prices for providing a public good, Lindahls thought experiment can be motivated
using quantities rather than prices (see, for example, Cornes and Sandler 1996).
Assume that each country is permitted a share of global emissions, i = xi =X,
P
that is determined exogenously and ni=1 i = 1. A Lindahl equilibrium, which
by de nition implements Pareto optimal emissions, then arises if i = i =A for all
i.11 Di¤erentiating the share equation, it holds that dXi =dxi = (1 i )=i = i ,
so the di¤erence between Lindahl shares (which also de ne an optimal burdensharing agreement) and the conjectural variation parameter is therefore a matter
of interpretation.
There are, however, some well-known shortcomings of the conjectural variations approach. The most obvious is that a countrys conjecture is arbitrary
and possibly incorrect. But this criticism should be considered in light of the
fact that the assumption of Nash behavior is also quite arbitrary and perhaps
more questionable in the context of international climate policy, where some
degree reciprocity among countries is clearly at work. There are also concerns
about whether conjectures are consistent with optimal responses at an equilibrium
(Sugden 1985; Scafuri 1988), but these concerns reect a more general criticism.
Because conjectural variations are based on the idea that agents (i.e., countries)
respond to one another in some particular way, arguments are often made that
capturing the underlying idea is more appropriate through explicit modeling of
a repeated game.12

5.2

A Repeated Game

International negotiations to mitigate climate change clearly have a repeated
game aspect whereby countries set emission targets period after period.13 As
mentioned previously, the one-period game can be interpreted as a single long
11

To see this, solve maxxi fBi (xi )
i Xg, where X = xi = i and  i = i =A, to verify the
solution is xi for all i.
12
Itaya and Okamura (2003) show speci c cases in which the conjectural variations equilibrium is observationally equivalent to the strategies played in the subgame perfect equilibrium
of the underlying repeated game for voluntary provision of a public good.

See Barrett (1994, 2003) for some of the early treatments and discussion of international
environmental agreements as a repeated game.

period, but in this subsection, I extend the model to a repeated game. To keep
things as simple as possible, I consider only pure and stationary strategies, denoted as either (x1 ; :::; xn ) or (xi ; x i ) in more compact notation. All countries
are assumed to have the discount factor  2 (0; 1), complete information, and
perfect recall of the history of play.
Assuming either an in nitely repeated game or one with an uncertain duration,14 the discounted payo¤ to country i can be written as

A standard and immediate result is that the Nash equilibrium level of emissions
in the stage game for all countries, (^
x1 ; :::; x^n ), constitutes a subgame perfect
equilibrium in the repeated game, and this result holds for any  and prior history
of emissions. This is consistent with all countries choosing to internalize the
DSCC in the repeated game.
I now consider whether the choice of something greater than the DSCCin
particular, the GSCCcan be sustained as a subgame perfect equilibrium. A
natural place to begin is with Nash reversion strategies. All countries choose a
level of emissions (x1 ; :::; xn ) in each period until one country deviates, at which
point all countries revert to (^
x1 ; :::; x^n ) for all periods thereafter. Whether continually choosing (x1 ; :::; xn )and therefore an implied SCC for each country
constitutes a subgame perfect equilibrium depends on whether any country has
an incentive to deviate in any period. The necessary and su¢cient condition to
avoid deviation can be written as
vi (^
xi ; x i )

vi (xi ; x i )   [Vi (xi ; x i )

Vi (^
xi ; x
^ i )] for all i:

(11)

The left-hand side is the maximum gain from deviating in one period, and the
right-hand side is the discounted future loses from reversion beginning in the next

In a game of uncertain duration,  represents the product of the discount factor and the
continuation probability. I will, however, refer to  simply as the discount factor in the main
text.

period. Substituting (10) into (11) and rearranging yields a useful variant of the
same relationship:
1




[vi (^
xi ; x i )

vi (xi ; x i )]  vi (xi ; x i )

vi (^
xi ; x
^ i ):

(12)

The left-hand side is always non-negative and converges to zero as  ! 1. Hence
whether the condition can be satis ed depends on whether the right-hand side is
positive. This simple observation produces several results.
The rst is that choosing to internalize more than the DSCC can be individually rational for all countries if  is su¢ciently large. To prove this, let
vi =dx = i (1 n) < 0, and the right-hand
xi = x^i + dx for all i. It follows that d^
side of (12) is positive for all i if dx < 0. This means that continually choosing
(x1 ; :::; xn ) < (^
x1 ; :::; x^n ) is a subgame perfect equilibrium if  is su¢ciently close
to 1. In other words, if countries care enough about the future, then in the repeated game, it is individually rational to emit less than the Nash equilibrium
in the stage game, and this is equivalent to internalizing more than the DSCC.15
While this may not be the rst-best solution, the point is that countries are no
longer stuck with only their DSCCs in the repeated game.
The second set of results relate speci cally to the GSCC. If, as discussed in
Section 4, it holds that vi  v^i for all i, and  is su¢ciently large, then (x1 ; :::; xn )
constitutes a subgame perfect equilibrium. Hence choosing to internalize the
GSCC can be individually rational. Moreover, even if vi < v^i for some i, transfers
of the form de ned previously, where vi v^i +  i > 0 for all i, can also support
internalizing the GSCC in a repeated game. The overall intuition for these results
is that if countries are concerned about the future and interact repeatedly, they
will choose long-term cooperation over short-term gain.
There are many results applicable here from the literature on repeated games
and the Folk Theorem. It is worth mentioning that a common critique about the
usefulness of the Folk Theorem is that anything goes because of the large set
of potential subgame perfect equilibria in repeated games. In this setting, however, that is precisely the contribution, because it shows how countries choosing
to internalize something more than their DSCC can be individual rational. I
have used what is perhaps the simplest setup to potentially rationalize a countrys internalization of the GSCC, or at least something greater than the DSCC.
15

This result is essentially an application of the Nash Reversion Folk Theorem (see Mas-Colell
et al. 1995).

17

The results highlight the importance of repeated interaction, complete information, and the potential use of transfers. It may be no coincidence therefore that
each of these conditions featured prominently in the most recent United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreement in Paris. The
agreement has detailed provisions about the schedule for renewed commitments,
mechanisms to improve information acquisition and dissemination, and commitments for climate nance to developing countries.
A promising line of future research is to consider alternative punishment
schemes to Nash reversion and thereby allowing the study of more general insights of Folk Theorem type results.16 Further research would also be useful that
considers the e¤ect of imperfect monitoring. Mailath and Samuelson (2006) provide a good starting point with their treatment of public and private monitoring,
which in this case would capture realistic challenges for monitoring and reporting
of emissions data through multilateral entities or countries themselves.

6

Strategic SCC

With the exception of the choice of a discount rate in IAMs, empirical estimates
of the GSCC are generally understood to be the result of positive rather than
normative analysis. The existing research focuses on improving empirical methods and expanding data availability to provide better estimation (Pizer et al.
2014; Burke et al. 2016). Within a political context, however, seeking the one
right estimate of the GSCC fails to recognize the strategic incentives on the part
of sovereign countries. Even with a true GSCC, countries will in general have
di¤erent preferences for a globally internalized shadow value on emissions. In this
section, I introduce the notion of a strategic SCC (SSCC) to de ne the concept. I
then relate the SSCC to the other SCC measures and consider empirical evidence
and policy implications.
One way to think about the task at hand is to consider each countrys preference for the level of a uniform and globally implemented carbon tax, where each
country retains its own tax revenue. The problem is similar that in Weitzman
(2014, 2015), but di¤ers because the focus here is not on a carbon tax per se.
16

Although Nordhaus (2015) considers a static game, his formulation of a climate club that
imposes trade sanctions on non-members provides and example of such a punishment scheme.
See Böhringer, Carbone, and Rutherford (2016) for an analysis with similar elements.

18

Instead, I focus on the level of global ambition each country would like to see
through a uniformly applied marginal cost on emissions, which can be implemented in countries through any choice of policy instruments.17
Let s denote a minimum marginal cost on emissions that all countries internalize. We can then write each countrys associated level of emissions as
)
(
Bi0 (xi ) = s if s  i
:
xi (s) = xi : 0
Bi (xi ) = i otherwise
This expression is equivalent to each countrys demand for emissions with a price
oor at its DSCC, reecting how a country would choose to internalize i rather
than some s < i .
It follows that each countrys preference for a uniformly implemented marginal
cost of emissions comes from solving
max Bi (xi (si ))
si

i

n
X

xj (si ).

(13)

j=1

Note that i is the only marginal damage that matters from country is perspective. The solution to (13), denoted s~i , will satisfy
Bi0 (xi (~
si ))x0i (~
si ) =

i

n
X

x0j (~
si ).

(14)

j=1

The important feature about this condition is that the right-hand side includes
the avoided marginal damages to country i of lower emissions in country i and
all other countries.18 We can thus de ne the following:
De nition 3 (SSCC) The Strategic Social Cost of Carbon is s~i for all i.
I now consider how a countrys SSCC compares with its DSCC and the GSCC,
17

See Aldy and Pizer (2016) for a discussion on comparing ambition based on explicit and
implicit carbon prices.
18
I have implicitly assumed that the second-order condition for a global maximum is satis ed. A su¢cient (though not necessary) condition that I will use to illustrate some results is for all countries to have linear demand for emissions. This means that x00i (s) =
Bi000 (xi (s))x0i (s)=Bi00 (xi (s))2 = 0, which implies Bi000 (xi (s)) = 0. It also implies that (13)
is globally concave, as the second derivative of the objective function simpli es to x0i (si ) < 0.

19

before turning to some empirical evidence and various decision rules for aggregating preferences.

6.1

Comparison with DSCC and GSCC

Let us rst consider the DSCC. Rearranging (14) and using (4), we have

Because Bi00 (xi ) < 0, it follows that xi (~
implies that a country would choose a uniformly internalized marginal cost on
emissions higher than i ; that is, its SSCC is greater than it DSCC. The reason
follows immediately from the comparison between (4) and (14): when choosing s~i ,
a country enjoys the additional bene t of forcing other countries to lower their
emissions, and this provides an incentive to increase the domestically internalized
cost beyond i .19
Turning now to a comparison with A, it is useful to begin with all identical
countries. Recognizing the symmetry of solutions and suppressing subscripts,
equation (14) simpli es to
s)) = n = A.
B 0 (x(~
The immediate implication is that s~ = A. In other words, with all identical
countries, each country would choose a SSCC equal to the GSCC, and as we
have seen, this is consistent with Pareto optimal emissions.
But the same result does not hold in general with heterogeneity among countries. To see the di¤erent mechanisms at work, let us make the further simplifying
assumption of linear demand for emissions in each country. Letting x0i (s) = bi for
19

Weitzman (2014) discusses an externality internalizing incentive in the context of a uniformly applied carbon tax, but the idea has a much earlier provenance in public economics
(Bowen 1943), where, for example, there is concern about tax rates that citizens in a municipality would like to see for the provision public goods such as education. Individuals are willing
to pay higher taxes themselves in order to get the bene t of others having to do the same.

20

all i, we can rewrite and simplify (14) as
Bi0 (xi (~
si )) =

i+

i

bi

X

bj .

(15)

j6=i

The general result is that each countrys choice of s~i can be greater than or less
than A. This follows immediately from (15) because the right-hand side does not
depend on j for all j 6= i, which gives wide latitude for the second term to be
greater than or less than A i .
To build intuition for the di¤erent possibilities, it is useful to consider the
simple case where n = 2. If we simplify even further by assuming bi = bj , it is
easy to see from (15) that s~i R A(= i + j ) if and only if i R j . This implies
not only that a country with greater marginal damages chooses a greater SSCC;
a countrys SSCC will be greater than the GSCC when it has relatively higher
marginal damages. In this case, there is an incentive to force the other country
to lower emissions, with overall reductions more than are Pareto optimal. It is
also useful to consider the case of i = j and heterogenous demand, whereby
s~i R A if and only if bj =bi R 1, and recall that bi ; bj < 0. This means that country
i will choose a SSCC greater (lower) than the GSCC if and only if country j has
a more (less) responsive demand for emissions. The reason is that country i does
not experience the greater (less) marginal cost of foregone emissions in country
j when determining its preference for a uniform marginal cost on emissions.20
In summary, all countries will have a SSCC greater than their own DSCC,
but possibly greater than or less than the GSCC. The fact that some countries
may prefer a uniform marginal cost of emissions greater than the GSCC is at
rst somewhat counter-intuitive, but becomes clear when considering how these
are countries with relatively at demand for emissions, large marginal damages,
or both. These are in e¤ect the countries that would like to see a very stringent
global emissions policy, a view certainly consistent with those of the small island
nations.
20

A further result worth noting with linear demand is the possibility for s~i = A for all i even
with heterogenous countries. Although it is a knife-edged result, the condition will hold if all
countries have the same ratio of marginal costs to bene ts of emissions; that is, the ratio i =bi
is the same for all i. To see this, note that the identical ratio condition requires bj = bi ( j = i )
for all j and i, and substitution into (15) yields a right-hand side equal to A.

a GSCC of $40

6.2

Empirical Evidence and Decision Rules

I provide some empirical evidence on the SSCC for di¤erent countries and regions
using the C-DICE model (Nordhaus 2015). Consistent with the parameterization
discussed in Section 4, I assume a GSCC of $40, the distribution of DSCCs shown
in Figure 1, and bene t functions described in footnote 9. Figure 6 lists the
SSCC for each country or region. They range from a low of $13 for Eurasia
to a high of $91 for India. The countries and regions are almost evenly split
between those with a SSCC below and above the GSCC of $40. Figure 6 also
illustrates preferences for the SSCC graphically. Each country or regions net
bene t (normalized to its maximum at the SSCC) is shown on a curve for di¤erent
levels of a globally internalized shadow value on emissions. These curves show
how preferences for the SSCC are single-peaked; that is, a country or regions net
bene t declines as the shadow price moves away from its preferred SSCC.
The set of preferences illustrated in Figure 6 provide a basis for studying
how countries might agree on a uniformly implemented shadow value on emissions. Weitzman (2014, 2015) considers a thought experiment involving a ctitious World Climate Assembly that votes on a uniform carbon tax. But the
need for such preference aggregation can apply more generally to a globally internalized shadow price, regardless of the policy instrument. This might arise as
part of an international agreement, where, for example, Aldy and Pizer (2016)
discuss benchmarking levels of ambition based on implicit prices of carbon. More
immediately, multilateral development agencies, such as the World Bank, emphasize the need to account for a SCC in program evaluation that voting member
countries must approve.21
In what follows, I assume countries must agree on a single, minimum SCC
that all countries internalize. Let D : Rn ! R1 denote a decision rule that
maps n country preferences for the SSCC into a single number, denoted DCC for
decision cost of carbon. I consider several voting rules to study how they a¤ect
the DCC.22
Table 1 lists the di¤erent rules and corresponding estimates of the DCC. The
natural starting point is majority voting, for which the standard result is that the
21

The World Bank currently uses a value of $30 per ton in 2015, raising to $80 per ton by
2050 (World Bank 2015).
22
In all cases, I apply the decision rule under the assumption of no transfers from one country
to another.

outcome will reect preferences of the median voter. In this case, the median voter
is Brazil, and the DCC is $45. As a point of comparison, the table also reports the
mean SSCC corresponding to each voting scheme, and in all cases, the mean is
close to the median. Other voting schemes are a population weighted majority at
$51 and a GDP weighted majority at $46. Given the way that UNFCCC decision
making is based on consensus, I also consider the largest shadow value that
would achieve unanimous support in the sense that no country would prefer the
Nash equilibrium. The result is $21, and the pivotal region is Eurasia. Finally,
I consider voting outcomes weighted by actual voting shares of di¤erent units
within the World Bank Group.23 This results in $48 for the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), $46 for the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), and $54 for the International Development Association (IDA).
In all cases, the number is higher than the $30 currently used at the World Bank.

Conclusion

This paper contributes a theoretical foundation for the SCC to a literature that
focuses almost exclusively on producing empirical estimates. The basic framework
highlights this distinction between the DSCC and the GSCC, and relates them to
the conditions of Pareto optimality and Nash equilibrium for a global public bad.
The model helps frame the growing debate about whether countries should take

account of the global bene ts of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions when setting
and evaluating domestic policy. Analysis also shows how choices between the
DSCC and the GSCC are subject to distributional e¤ects in addition well-known
free riding incentives.
Extensions of the model identify conditions under which a countrys decision
to internalize the GSCC, or at least something greater than the DSCC, can be
individually rational. To capture international relations where a country reduces
its own emissions to leverage reductions from other countries, I consider non-Nash
behavior with a conjectural variations approach. As another alternative, I extend
the model to a repeated game that accounts for the way international negotiations
to mitigate climate change take place repeatedly over time. Folk Theorem type
results prove useful in this context. In both cases, it can be in a countrys self
interest to internalize the GSCC, as currently practiced in regulatory impact
analysis by a growing number of countries.
But countries may not agree on the same value of the GSCC, and understanding why is consistent with the notion of a strategic SCC that I develop
here. Seeking one estimate of the GSCC upon which all sovereign countries can
agree abstracts from each countrys strategic incentives. I show how all countries prefer a SSCC that is greater than their DSCC, but can be less than or
greater than the GSCC. Empirical evidence based on the C-DICE model shows
how countries or regions would prefer a globally internalized shadow value on
emissions that ranges from $13 (Eurasia) to $91 (India) when the actual GSCC
is $40. Di¤erent voting schemes for preference aggregation, however, result in
shadow values relatively close to the GSCC.
In conclusion, a central contribution of this paper is demonstration of the
need to more research on the theoretical underpinnings of the SCC. I have sought
to show how establishing and using the GSCC among sovereign countries is not
simply a case of estimating and internalizing an externality. While the theoretical
treatments and empirical demonstrations are intentionally simple, they open the
door to future research with potentially important insights to guide the estimation
and use of the SCC and inform the design of future climate policy.
