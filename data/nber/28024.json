Second, the relation is highly asymmetric: A rise in uncertainty is associated with a sharp decline in the lower tail of the growth distribution whereas it has a much smaller and insignificant impact on its upper tail. Third, the negative response of growth to uncertainty shocks is larger when the equity market is more volatile. We build a model in which growth and uncertainty are both endogenous: rapid adoption of new technology raises economic uncertainty and may cause measured productivity to decline. The equilibrium growth distribution is negatively skewed and higher uncertainty leads to a thicker left tail and to more labor reallocation among jobs and among\n\n",
