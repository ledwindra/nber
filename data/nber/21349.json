    "abstract": "\n\nBased on the most comprehensive grain prices available, we employ a storage model to estimate consistent interest rates and compare capital market development in Britain and China. Interest rates for Britain were lower than China\u2019s on average by about three percentage points from 1770 to 1860. Regional capital market integration in the Yangzi Delta comes close to the British average at distances below 200 kilometers, but at larger distances interest rate correlations in Britain are twice those of the Delta, and three or more times as high as elsewhere in China. Overall, our results suggest capital market divergence at an early date.\n\n",
