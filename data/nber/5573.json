    "abstract": "\n\nThe paper explores the implications of high debt for monetary policy.  In Europe, debt (and deficits) play a special role at present in the run up to Maastricht because large debts are seen as a threat to the integrity of the new European money.  The paper reviews two historical episodes-- the German, UK, and French experience in the 1920s and the US debt liquidation of the 1950-1980 period.  The theoretical review focuses on hypotheses of Keynes, Clark and Sargent- Wallace.  The paper adds to the range of concerns private balance sheet vulnerability.\n\n",
