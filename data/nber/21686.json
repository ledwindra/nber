    "abstract": "\n\nFinancial innovation in recent decades has expanded portfolio choice. We investigate how greater choice affects investors\u2019 savings and asset returns. We establish a choice channel by which greater portfolio choice increases investors\u2019 savings\u2014by enabling them to earn the aggregate risk premium or to take speculative positions. In equilibrium, portfolio customization (access to risky assets beyond the market portfolio) reduces the risk-free rate. Participation (access to the market portfolio) reduces the risk premium but typically increases the risk-free rate. Empirically, stock market participants in the U.S. save more than nonparticipants, and have increasingly dispersed portfolio returns, consistent with the choice channel.\n\n",
