Shrouded Costs of Government: The Political Economy of State and Local Public Pensions
Edward L. Glaeser and Giacomo A. M. Ponzetto
NBER Working Paper No. 18976
April 2013
JEL No. H55,H75
ABSTRACT
Why are public-sector workers so heavily compensated with pensions and other non-pecuniary benefits?
In this paper, we present a political economy model of shrouded compensation in which politicians
compete for taxpayers' and public employees' votes by promising compensation packages, but some
voters cannot evaluate every aspect of compensation. If pension packages are "shrouded," meaning
that public-sector workers better understand their value than ordinary taxpayers, then compensation
will be inefficiently back-loaded. In equilibrium, the welfare of public-sector workers could be improved,
holding total public sector costs constant, if they received higher wages and lower pensions. Central
control over dispersed municipal pensions has two offsetting effects on pension generosity: more state-level
media attention helps taxpayers better understand pension costs, which reduces pension generosity;
but a larger share of public sector workers will live within the jurisdiction, which increases pension
generosity. We discuss pension arrangements in two decentralized states (California and Pennsylvania)
and two centralized states (Massachusetts and Ohio) and find that in these cases, centralization appears
to have modestly reduced pension arrangements; but, as the model suggests, this finding is unlikely
to be universal.

Introduction

Credit card companies and hotels have charged “shrouded”fees that were di¢ cult for most
consumers to assess at the …rst point of purchase (Gabaix and Laibson 2006). States and
localities commit to pension obligations that are similarly di¢ cult for voters to assess. NovyMarx and Rauh (2010) argue that states and localities have underestimated the shortfall
in pension funding by trillions of dollars because of aggressive assumptions about returns
on pension investments, and the continuing debate over their conclusions reinforces the
point that pension promises are hard to evaluate (Mitchell and McCarthy 1999). How does
the di¢ culty of evaluating the costs of future obligations impact the level of public wages
and bene…ts, and what institutions lead to better outcomes for taxpayers and public-sector
workers?
After discussing the basics of local pension arrangements across the United States in
Section 2, in Section 3 we present a political economy model in the spirit of Glaeser, Ponzetto
and Shapiro (2005) and Ponzetto (2011). Politicians compete for votes by making binding
promises about public-sector wages and pensions. These promises ensure that public-sector
workers prefer their jobs to the private sector. Housing prices equilibrate to make citizens
indi¤erent about living in the community.
Policy promises are heard by only a portion of the electorate. Generally, we assume that
promises about pensions are understood less often than promises about wages. Moreover, we
assume that public-sector workers are more aware of these promises than voters generally.
We also generally assume that public-sector workers are relatively better informed about
pensions than other voters. These assumptions can be justi…ed if taxpayers and publicsector workers both have access to public information sources (the “news”), but public-sector
workers also have access to an added information source (the“union”), and all sources have
a proportionally lower chance of appropriately reporting pension promises relative to wage
promises.
Unlike Gabaix and Laibson (2006), we do not assume that uninformed voters underestimate the value of the costs that they do not hear. The ignorant correctly infer what the
politicians will do. Still, as in Glaeser, Ponzetto and Shapiro (2005), their ignorance impacts
the political equilibrium because politicians cannot change the voting behavior of the ignorant by changing their promises. Our core political results would not change if uninformed
voters naively underestimated future pension costs, as long as the marginal home buyer correctly anticipates the cost of pension obligations. Indeed, we suspect that a model with less
rationality would only strengthen our results.
As politicians are inherently identical in the model, a variant of the standard median voter
result holds, and both politicians choose identical promises. (A slight perturbation of the
model, following our earlier work, would give one of the politicians privileged communications
with public sector unions and that would lead to policy divergence between the candidates,
where the politician with extra access promised more generous pensions). The pensions and
wages o¤ered by politicians re‡ect two …rst-order conditions that essentially set the bene…ts
that workers get against the cost imposed on taxpayers. The costs and bene…ts for the two
groups are multiplied by the size of the group in the informed voting population. Some
public-sector workers live outside the community, and this lowers their political clout, but
public-sector workers are better informed and this e¤ect increases their importance in the
2

politicians’calculus.
If relatively more union voters understand pension promises, then this pushes the equilibrium towards greater pension obligations. When public-sector workers have a greater
advantage over taxpayers in understanding pensions than wages, public-sector consumption
is higher post-retirement and public-sector workers would borrow against their future pensions if they could. We don’t allow such borrowing, because public pensions typically cannot
be taken in bankruptcy. If borrowing against pensions was extremely easy, then public
workers would receive no wages and receive all of their compensation in the form of pension
promises.
The informational advantages of public-sector workers cause them to earn rents or quasirents, and the political equilibrium leads to a situation in which voters and public-sector
workers could both bene…t from a di¤erent age-earnings pro…le for public-sector workers.
If public-sector workers earned higher wages while young in exchange for lower pension
bene…ts, their welfare could improve at no cost to the taxpayer. Fitzpatrick (2012) …nds
that Illinois teachers choose not to forgo cash today in exchange for future pensions that
have a substantially higher net present value (evaluated at market interest rates).
If pension promises are not fully funded by current taxes, then pension promises decrease
housing prices, but if housing supply growth is positive, the drop in the home values for
current owners does not fully capture the cost of pension promises. Some of the costs of
future pensions will be paid for by the owners of houses that have not yet been built, which
means that less fully funded pensions cost current taxpayers less. We assume that vacant
land doesn’t have votes attached to it; the impact of pre-funding requirements disappears
when we assume that there is no housing supply growth in the area. As long as housing
growth is positive, the model predicts that pre-funding requirements for pensions will lead to
lower pensions, but have no impact on overall public-sector wages, which causes public-sector
worker welfare to decline and housing prices to increase.
The spatial equilibrium structure of the model means that we can separately analyze
the impact of higher reservation utility, which re‡ects the general level of prosperity in the
country as a whole, and higher private incomes in the area, which will be o¤set by higher
housing prices. Higher incomes lead to higher public-sector wages, because they cause the
cost of housing to increase and that increases the marginal bene…t to public-sector workers
of receiving higher wages, while leaving the marginal cost to taxpayers untouched, since their
real incomes are determined by the reservation utility. We assume that workers move when
they retire, so higher incomes have no impact on the cost of living when old, and therefore
no impact on pensions. An increase in the cost of living in the retirement community does,
however, increase pension bene…ts.
Increases in the reservation utility, however, cause bene…ts to rise and have an ambiguous
impact on wages. The ambiguous e¤ect re‡ects two opposite e¤ects. Higher reservation
utility means that taxpayers have a lower marginal utility of income, reducing the cost of
pensions to them, but it also reduces housing prices, causing the marginal bene…t of wages
to public-sector workers to fall as well.
As the share of public-sector workers that live in the community rises, the amount paid to
public-sector workers in both wages and pensions also increase, because the political power
of the public-sector workers has risen. As the informational advantage of the public-sector
workers about wages falls, public-sector wages falls and so do pensions. As the informa3

tional advantage of the public-sector workers about bene…ts falls, bene…ts fall but wages
stay constant. The asymmetry between knowledge of wages and bene…ts re‡ects the fact
that lower public-sector wages (caused by better taxpayer knowledge about wages) increase
the marginal utility cost to the public workers of paying for their own pensions by decreasing their consumption while young. Lower public-sector pensions, however, do not impact
their marginal utility of consumption when young, because the tax bene…t of lower pension
payments are completely o¤set by higher housing costs.
In section 4, we use these results to discuss the impact of allocating control over public
pensions to the state or to lower levels of government. We assume that there are two o¤setting
e¤ects of allocating control to a higher level of government. First, there are state media
sources that will supplement the knowledge about pensions and wages at the local level.
Our information structure implies that this greater knowledge will increase the knowledge of
taxpayers about both wages and pensions, but it will have a greater impact on knowledge of
pensions because that knowledge started at a lower level. We also assume that the share of
public-sector workers who vote in the relevant election increases, since public-sector workers
are quite likely to live in the state where they work, but they are far less likely to live in the
community where they work.
The overall impact on wages and pensions depends on which e¤ect dominates. If the
impact of public-sector workers voting is more powerful, then state control will lead to more
generous wages and pension bene…ts. If the impact of reduced information asymmetries
between voters and workers is stronger, then state pensions and wages will be less generous.
If the local news sources provide at least a modest amount of information, then moving to
the state level will lead to a ‡attening of the consumption pro…le for state workers, because
of the reduced asymmetry between wage and pension knowledge. This ‡attening means that
if the move to state control held housing values constant, public-sector workers would be
unambiguously better o¤.
In section 5, we turn to four real world examples of states with di¤erent pension arrangements, both to understand why di¤erent systems evolve and to examine the impact of those
systems. We compare two pairs of states: Massachusetts and California, and Ohio and Pennsylvania. We cover the …rst two in some detail and brie‡y discuss the second pair. Both
pairs include a state with a central, state-level control over local pensions (Massachusetts
and Ohio) and a state with abundant local heterogeneity in county and municipal pensions
(California and Massachusetts).
Massachusetts had a modest number of local pensions prior to World War II, but in 1945
the state passed a law which controlled the terms of local pension arrangements. While
localities, somewhat oddly, continue to have control over investment decisions, the basic
generosity of the pension plans is set at the state level. Moreover, the state has regularly
reacted to perceived funding shortfalls by requiring higher levels of employee contributions.
California’s local pension plans are regulated at the state level, but counties and localities
have discretion over the generosity of the plan, within limits, whether the plan is independent
(like many of the county plans) or part of the broader CalPERS system. We speculate
that California’s decision to allow local heterogeneity re‡ected a lack of enthusiasm for an
earlier 1919 attempt to generate widespread local pension schemes, and a recognition of the
enormous heterogeneity within the large state.
Both California and Massachusetts have generous pension arrangements, but California’s
4

local plans are typically more generous. The di¤erence is not so much that the California
pensions provide less compensation in retirement, but rather that the Massachusetts plans
require signi…cantly higher levels of member contribution.
Ohio’s local plans were centralized in 1967, in response to an early under-funding requirement. The program also provides large pensions, but it has a 10 percent member contribution
rate, which is slightly above Massachusetts. Pennsylvania has great heterogeneity in plan
generosity. We consider Luzerne County, which is only slightly more generous than Ohio,
and Pittsburgh, which is considerably more generous. Again, the main gap in generosity
re‡ects di¤erences in member contributions.
It is di¢ cult to draw too much inference from four case studies, but in these cases central
control seems to have led to lower pensions. To us this suggests the power of shrouding,
because a primary di¤erence between state and local control is that more media attention
tends to be paid to pensions at the state level than purely local pension arrangements. We
do not, however, believe that this is a universal phenomenon.
We now turn to some basic facts about local pension arrangements across the United
States and then present our model.

State and Local Public Pensions

In this section, we survey the heterogeneity in local and pension plan arrangements across
the United States. Our focus is on municipal pension plans, but we discuss state plans as
well, because we believe they shed light on what would happen in towns and municipalities if
their pensions were determined at the state level. This discussion provides the institutional
basis for the model that follows in the next section.
America’s …fty states have …fty di¤erent arrangements concerning state and municipal
pensions. There are, however, common features across the country. Table 1 brie‡y summarizes the state and local plans for all …fty states. Almost all of states have state-level
pension programs covering the direct employees of the state. In most cases, there is also an
umbrella organization that some or all municipalities join. CalPERS, the California Public
Employees Retirement System, may be the most famous example of such a super-system,
as the nation’s largest public pension fund, with over $200 billion dollars of assets under
management. Many of these programs also deal with healthcare costs, but we will not focus
on the abundantly studied issues around healthcare costs in this paper.
Teachers, who typically represent a large share of municipal employment, often have their
own statewide systems that are distinct from, if often quite similar to, the more general state
program. Often the teacher systems are at once a part of and independent from the state
system. The California State Teacher Retirement System, CalSTRS, has $150 billion under
management, making it another …nancial behemoth. But unlike the CalPERS plan for
localities, participation in CalSTRS is obligatory for every school district and every school
teacher, and every teacher faces exactly the same de…ned bene…t program. That program
is …nanced primarily with employer and employee contributions, currently at 8.25 and 8
percent of compensation respectively. The state also makes contributions.
By contrast, participation in CalPERS, as in many state-level municipal programs, is
voluntary, and the municipalities that do participate have the option to contract tailored
5

programs with CalPERS. As a result, some California plans are considerably more generous
than others. The California system lies somewhat in the middle of American states in the
degree of autonomy its grants to localities.
The most centralized state systems, such as South Dakota and Utah, enroll all municipal
employees in a statewide system, managed down to every detail at the state level. These
states have not eliminated local negotiation over wages, or other working conditions, but the
pension payments are …xed at the state level. Both localities and workers must contribute
a proportion of their wages, and retired workers receive payments that are determined by a
formula based on past compensation and other factors, including years of service and age of
retirement. Even within these statewide systems, however, there are sector-speci…c pension
di¤erences for di¤erent groups such as teachers, policemen and …re…ghters.
In these states, there is no distinction between the state system and the municipal system,
but in most of America, the local systems— even if managed at the state level— have their
own characteristics. For example, Minnesota has a statewide Public Employees Retirement
Association for employees of local government, but this is distinct from the Minnesota State
Retirement System, which manages retirement for the state’s own workers. The Minnesota
system sets terms, mandates payments and manages the system’s investments.
The next level of centralization occurs in states, like Massachusetts, that have a state
system which is o¢ cially voluntary, but does in fact manage all, or almost all (Boston is
excluded), of the local systems. Somewhat bizarrely, even though Massachusetts sets the
terms of pensions and mandates employer and employee contributions to investment funds,
over 50 localities continue to maintain control over the investments related to their public
pensions.
Massachusetts is at one end of a spectrum of “voluntary” statewide programs, some of
which are virtually universal while some have far more sporadic membership. Each state
followed a di¤erent path towards their system, and provided di¤erent incentives or rules for
joining the statewide system (when it exists). In the majority of these systems, terms are
set centrally, but in a number of important systems, even those municipalities that join the
central system have discretion over the generosity of plan.
Within CalPERS, local governments can choose whether to have systems that accrue
pensions at 1.5% or 2% or even 3% rate; that percentage is multiplied by years of service
to determine the pension as a share of …nal compensation (subject to a maximum). Texas,
Oklahoma and Tennessee also allow discretion in the nature of the plan. Localities face a
menu, and then subject to the political process and bargaining with employees, choose their
preferred option.
Those localities that participate in statewide systems also face clear funding requirements
set at the state level. Historically, some systems once operated as pay-as-you-go systems,
requiring only that localities pay for the current year’s retired employees. Funding shortfalls,
especially in the 1980s, caused many states to switch to somewhat more conservative systems,
often moving gradually towards “full funding.” Of course, full funding is often calculated
using extremely high expected rates of return that still leave the possibility of substantial
cash shortfalls.
Completely local pension systems would seem to be the extreme of decentralization,
but even in that case, the state government can still exercise a fair amount of control over
local pensions. Cities have no independent constitutional rights; they are always creatures
6

of state government. For example, every one of California’s county pension system is a
matter of state law, even though the pensions have di¤erent terms that were determined
by collective bargaining at the state level. State law also governs the pensions of Boston
and New York. Yet in most cases, even thought the state does exercise ultimate legislative
power, the legislature will often defer to the city’s wishes.
Another dramatic di¤erence across states comes from their participation in Social Security. When Social Security was originally established, constitutional issues deterred any
attempt to involve lower levels of government. The Federal government did not appear to
have the power to compel states and municipalities to contribute to any sort of pension system for their employees, and as a result they were completely excluded from Social Security.
In the 1950s, Congress made it possible for states to enter voluntarily into Social Security,
and the majority of states have taken that option. Still, Table 1 notes those states that have
remained outside of the Social Security system, including Massachusetts.
Using funding ratios from Novy-Marx and Rauh (2009), which provide only a combined
estimate for states and localities, we did not see a clear linkage between the level of funding
and the degree of local control, perhaps because the bulk of the funding concerns state
employees. We believe that further investigation of this topic is a pressing area for future
research.
Table 2 compares the average yearly earnings of employees in the state in 2011 and the
average bene…ts paid to retired state employees in 2010. The wages are calculated across all
employees in the state using the 2010 Census. The bene…ts are calculated using the Census
report on state and local pension funds that reports bene…ts paid and bene…ciaries. These
numbers do little to control for pension retiree characteristics, or even whether the state
participates in Social Security, so they can only be seen as very coarse numbers. We have
also calculated the ratio of retirement earnings of state workers to current workers’earnings
in the next column.
In Figure 1, we show the correlation of bene…ts per bene…ciary and state wages. There is
a strong positive correlation but the relationship is far from perfect. If these numbers are in
any way correct, they suggest that some states are more generous than others, even holding
state income levels constant. One of the goals of our model is to provide a framework that
can help explain those di¤erences.

A Political Economy Model of Public Pensions

In this section, we present our core model of the political economy of public-sector pensions.
In the next section, we speci…cally focus on the issues that relate to central and local control
of pension promises. There are several key assumptions in the model. Perhaps the most
critical assumption is that pension promises are “shrouded.” While this model is in the
spirit of Gabaix and Laibson (2006), applying their logic to the public sector, we are not
assuming any irrationality. Our voters do expect to pay workers’ pensions, but not every
voter is aware of the pensions promised by individual politicians. They are ignorant, but not
irrational.
Some voters are also unaware of wage promises, but we assume that understanding the
magnitude of pension obligations is somewhat more di¢ cult than understanding current
7

compensation. The logic of the model, therefore, should extend to any complex form of
compensation including health-related bene…ts. We also assume that public-sector workers
know more about pensions and wages than ordinary voters. Technically, we assume that
workers and taxpayers both have access to the same news-related sources of information,
but public-sector workers also have access to an added source of information: the “union.”
In reality, workers should know more about their compensation packages because they have
far stronger incentives to understand these packages than voters.
Another key assumption is that public-sector workers cannot freely borrow against future
pensions. This assumption ensures that pensions are not a perfect substitute for wages from
the workers’perspective. In the case of other forms of shrouded compensation, there could
be other reasons why workers would prefer cash to the bene…t. Workers might, for example,
just not value health bene…ts at their cost.
We also impose several less critical assumptions. There is a prefunding requirement imposed exogenously on government pensions. All public-sector workers vote in state elections,
but only a fraction vote in local elections, because they are assumed to live outside of the
locality. State workers earn rents (or potentially quasi-rents) and as such there must be a
rationing device, which we assume is a lottery that occurs before the start of the model.

3.1

Economic Environment

In its basic structure, the model follows an overlapping generations setup. When young,
individuals choose their location and they must be indi¤erent between living in that location
and locating someplace else. This indi¤erence condition means that changes in pensions, or
institutional conditions that impact public-sector compensation, do not impact the welfare
of these citizens, but they will impact housing prices in the city, which adjust to compensate
residents for expected future tax payments. Indeed, we will follow the Henry George theorem
(Arnott and Stiglitz, 1979) and treat the value of land at the beginning of time as one
measure of welfare. However, the equivalence between housing prices and welfare in this
setting only holds if we assume that the rents earned by public-sector workers have been
dissipated through some early competition for public-sector jobs, which we do not model.
An exogenous fraction q < 1=2 of workers have won the public-sector lottery and can
work for a particular local government. All winners take that option, but only a fraction
2 (0; 1] of them live in the city. This proportion will critically determine their political clout
in the city. In principle, there is a participation constraint that requires local governments
to provide su¢ cient compensation to make that decision optimal, but that constraint only
binds in limit cases.1
There is an exogenously determined stock of housing in the city that grows at a constant
rate
0. We assume that this re‡ects a …xed regulatory growth limit on new construction.
This assumption could also be justi…ed by assuming that there is a cost of construction that
is increasing with the amount of construction, but in an endogenous construction model, the
rate of growth would be a function of pension promises. By assuming exogenous growth, we
1

Formally, the constraint is never binding when policy is centrally set at the state level. Under decentralized local policy-making, it is also non-binding provided that a minimum of public sector employees vote in
the local election.

8

break that link. The number of people equal the number of homes, so population grows at
the same rate as the housing stock.
Private-sector workers earn a …xed location-speci…c income Y when they are young; they
must save to consume during their retirement. Public-sector workers earn wages wt while
young and may also be paid a pension bene…t Bt+1 when they are older. Private- and publicsector workers pay for the cost of public-sector wages with lump sum taxes. Since houses
are the same, we could also think of these taxes as property taxes. Proportional taxes on
housing value will have an equivalent impact on initial housing prices as lump-sum taxes
since both imply the same tax burden.
Taxpayers and current public-sector workers also pay for the unfunded portion of pensions
paid to last period’s workers, who are now retired, and the funded portion of pensions that
will be paid to current workers during the next period. Speci…cally, we assume that a …xed
proportion 2 [0; 1] of pension obligations must be prefunded. Funds that are set aside to
pay future pensions earn the market rate of return r > and are given to retired public-sector
workers during the next period. Taxes in period t thus equal

People live in the city when they are young and retire elsewhere when they are old. The
cost of housing during retirement is an exogenous amount R. At the start of each period
t, the retiring old workers sell their homes to young workers at the current price Ht . The
newly-built houses are sold by developers to the young. Each buyer can take out a mortgage
for the full amount Ht . He will repay the principal in the following period, but must pay

These disposable incomes also coincide with public-sector employees’consumption level when

The Politicians’Problem

The model contains one key optimization problem: the political choice of public-sector compensation policies wt and Bt+1 . We model policy-making as the outcome of an electoral
process with binding platform commitments but imperfectly and heterogeneously informed
voters, following Ponzetto (2011).
The election is contested by two parties, labelled L and R, whose only goal is to win o¢ ce
and which accordingly choose their policy proposals to maximize the probability of obtaining
a majority of the votes cast. The electorate consists of a continuum of voters, whose total
mass can be normalized to unity each period. Following the probabilistic-voting approach
(Lindbeck and Weibull 1987), voters’preferences for the competing parties comprise two independent elements. Each voter derives utility Uti (wt ; Bt+1 ) from the policy vector (wt ; Bt+1 )
enacted by the winner of the election. Moreover, the two parties have …xed characteristics,
such as ideology or the personal qualities of party leaders, that cannot be credibly altered
with the choice of an electoral platform; and the voters have individual tastes, respectively
i
i
L and R , for these characteristics.
In the standard probabilistic-voting model, parties choose binding policy platforms and
all voters perfectly observe them. We relax the assumption of perfect information, and
10

instead consider a random process of imperfect information acquisition. Information arrives independently across agents. By the time the election is held, voter i has observed all
proposals with probability iw^B , only wage proposals with probability iw:B , only pension
proposals with probability iB:w , and no actual proposals at all with complementary probai
i
bility 1 iw^B
B:w . A microfounded derivation of these probabilities for taxpayers

and public-sector workers is detailed below.

the electoral outcome. The idiosyncratic shock
provides the intensive margin of political
support, and is independent and identically distributed across agents. For the sake of clarity,
we assume that i has a uniform distribution with support
;
su¢ ciently wide that
each voter’s ballot is not perfectly predictable on the basis of policy considerations only.2
Voters are divided into two groups: fraction q of public-sector workers, and fraction
1
q of taxpayers. All members of either group j 2 fP; T g have an identical utility
function Utj (wt ; Bt+1 ) and identical information-acquisition probabilities jw^B , jw:B , and
j
B:w . Since there is a continuum of agents of either type and the arrival of information is
independent across agents, these probabilities coincide with the shares of voters from each
group that have observed proposals respectively for both policies or for each one alone.
Given the realization of the common shock , the fraction of citizens of type j who vote
for party R equals

Rational voters can anticipate the equilibrium platforms of the two parties with perfect

for C 2 fL; Rg). Yet, politicians’ strategies are
foresight (wt = wtC and Bt+1 = Bt+1
driven by imperfect and heterogeneous information o¤ the equilibrium path. An uninformed
agent correctly anticipates the equilibrium proposals, but he would fail to notice a deviation
from the expected policy choice, and thus could not react to such a deviation when casting
his vote. Politicians optimally set each policy wt and Bt+1 to cater disproportionately to
the preferences of those voters who are disproportionately likely to observe the respective
proposal, because only those voters’ballots re‡ect directly the policy commitments.

3.3

Voter Information

Lemma 1 establishes that whenever public-sector workers are more informed about their
compensation than other taxpayers ( Pw > Tw and PB > TB ), they obtain a more generous
treatment than their mere numbers would warrant. Furthermore, if their informational
advantage is greater for pensions than wages ( Pw = Tw < PB = TB ), public-sector pensions are
12

more generous than public-sector wages. We shall now prove that this pattern of information
asymmetry emerges from a simple process of information acquisition.
Information about policy proposals is provided to all voters by local news sources. Each
agent receives information about wage proposal from the news with probability L 2 (0; 1).
The probability of receiving information about proposed pension is L for 2 (0; 1), capturing our fundamental assumption that pension obligations are “shrouded.” < 1 re‡ects directly lower availability of information about pensions than wages. State employees’salaries
are publicly disclosed every year, and can be easily consulted through the online edition of
local newspapers.3 No such database exists for the accruing pensions of currently employed
civil servants. Moreover, < 1 re‡ects the greater di¢ culty of understanding the accrual
of pension obligations. Thus the parameter allows us to capture with a simple formulation
that a voter may be informed of a debate about the cost of public-sector pensions, but still
unable to grasp the actual impact of di¤erent policy proposals.
In addition to the local news that reach all taxpayers, public-sector workers naturally have
more opportunities and greater incentives to become informed of policy proposals concerning
their own compensation. Ponzetto (2011) models explicitly the sharing of information about
sector-speci…c policy among co-workers in the workplace, and agents’ willingness to make
costly investments to acquire sector-speci…c information. Here we make the simplifying
assumption that public employees have access to a second source of news: public-sector
unions. In addition to the probability L of being informed by the news, and independent
of the arrival of such information, every public-sector worker has probability U 2 (0; 1) of
being informed of wage proposals by the union. Once again, pensions are less visible, and
the relative probability of information through the union is only U .
This structure implies that the information probabilities for taxpayers are

with the following properties (all proofs are provided in the appendix).
Lemma 2 For any policy proposal, public-sector workers are more likely to informed than
taxpayers. Their information advantage is greater for pensions than wages (0 < B < w <
1).
Information asymmetry declines when local news provide more information (@ w =@ L >
0 and @ B =@ L > 0) and increases when public-sector unions provide more information

(@ w =@ U < 0 and @ B =@ U < 0). When pensions are more shrouded, information about
them is more asymmetric (@ B =@ > 0).
The relative asymmetry of information about pensions compared to wages is higher when
pensions are more shrouded (@ ( B = w ) =@ > 0) and when either source provides more
information (@ ( B = w ) =@ L < 0 and @ ( B = w ) =@ U < 0).
Intuitively, information acquisition has positive but diminishing returns. Receiving additional news from the union makes public-sector working better informed across the board; the
e¤ect is naturally stronger, the more information the union conveys (@ p =@ U < 0). Moreover, the additional information is more valuable when local news are poorly informative
(@ p =@ L > 0).
Diminishing returns also imply that public employees’informational advantage is always
stronger for pension proposals, which are more di¢ cult to get to know and which taxpayers
are more likely to ignore ( B < w ). Furthermore, its strength is increasing in the degree
of shrouding of public-sector pensions (low ). The degree of shrouding a¤ects information
asymmetry over pensions but not over wages, so it naturally increases relative asymmetry
(@ ( B = w ) =@ > 0).
Finally, the lemma establish that any increase in informativeness, whether of the news or
of the union, makes the two issues more asymmetric (@ ( B = w ) =@ L < 0 and @ ( B = w ) =@ U <
0). Intuitively, taxpayers’relative information is …xed at TB = Tw = , so the e¤ect of greater
information plays out only through public employee’s relative information PB = Pw . Hence,
more information has the same e¤ect on relative asymmetry regardless of its source. Diminishing returns once more explain why its e¤ect is an increase in relative asymmetry: the
additional information has a greater e¤ect on the less visible issue, i.e., pensions.

Dynamic Equilibrium

To solve the model, we must account for the dynamic structure of an overlapping generations
economy. With anything short of full prefunding, current pension promises Bt+1 directly
in‡uence future taxes Tt+1 . This connection implies an indirect impact on future house
prices Ht+1 through the spatial indi¤erence condition, and on future wages wt+1 and pension
promises Bt+1 through the political optimality conditions.
The timeline within each period t is the following.
1. The city inherits from the previous period binding pension promises Bt .
2. The house price Ht is determined so that taxpayers’ spatial indi¤erence condition
holds.. The young buy houses and move to the city. The old retire, sell their houses
and leave the city.
C
3. Politicians simultaneously announce binding policy proposals wtC ; Bt+1
. Each voter
i
i is informed of wage proposals with probability w and of pension proposals with
probability iB . The election is held.

4. The winning candidate’s policy proposal is implemented. Public-sector workers earn
wages wt , while taxes Tt are levied to defray these wages, the unfunded component
14

of current pensions Bt , and the funded component of future pensions Bt+1 . Workers
choose how much to save and invest in capital markets.
The period then ends, and the process beings anew for period t + 1. Period-t voters
become old and sell their houses at a price Ht+1 . The link between generations is the joint
evolution of pension and house prices.
A dynamic equilibrium is characterized by three functions H (x), w (x) and B (x) such
that for any pension obligation Bt = x house prices are Ht = H (x), public employees’wages
wt = w (x) and public-sector pension promises Bt+1 = B (x) Rational expectations imply
that agents correctly anticipate policies wt and Bt+1 when the house price Ht is determined.
Crucially, they also correctly anticipate, by iteration, future house prices Ht+1 = H (B (x)).
The spatial equilibrium condition (11) and lemma 1 jointly characterize the dynamic
equilibrium. To simplify notation, de…ne a transformed index of voting participation by
public-sector employees
(1 q)
2 [0; 1] ,
(19)

which is monotone increasing in with ~ = 0 , = 0 and ~ = 1 , = 1. The three

An explicit solution for the dynamic equilibrium can be obtained because our assumptions
ensure that the three equilibrium functions are all linear in inherited pension obligations.
Proposition 1 In equilibrium, house prices are a function
H (x) = H + h (B

The sensitivity of house prices to inherited pension obligations is a constant h 2 [0; (1
)
q= (1 + )] that decreases with city growth (@h=@ < 0) and with pre-funding (@h=@ < 0) and
increases with the share of public employees (@h=@q > 0) and the interest rate (@h=@r > 0).

The structure of the equilibrium re‡ects the dynamic feedback between public-sector
pensions and house prices. The immediate consequence of an increase x in unfunded pension
obligations Bt is to require an increase in taxes Tt by the amount [(1
) = (1 + )] qx of
unfunded pension obligations per capita. This tax increase induces a one-to-one direct
decrease in house prices Ht by the amount. This decline, however, is counteracted by indirect
e¤ects, so the equilibrium fall in house prices dampened (h < [(1
) = (1 + )] q).
The starting point of the feedback loop is that a decline in house prices reduces public
employees’ housing costs. Political optimality requires an invariant consumption by pubP
P
lic employees both while working (CW
is independent of x) and while retired (CW
is also
independent of x because H (x) is linear). Since a decline in Ht reduces one-to-one their
mortgage repayment in old age, it requires a decline in pension promises Bt+1 .
The decline in Bt+1 then triggers a proportional increase in Ht+1 because young buyers
at t + 1 expect lower taxes due to lower inherited pension obligations. Since public-sector
retirees own houses in the city, the expected increase in their home equity Ht+1 requires a
16

one-to-one further decrease in their pension Bt+1 to keep their retirement income constant.
This multiplier e¤ect implies that a rise x in pension obligations Bt , which reduces current
house prices Ht by hx, also increases house price appreciation (Ht+1 Ht ) by hx= (1 x),
and reduces future pension promises by the same amount.
Both the present value of private-sector workers’ lifetime disposable income (A) and
P
public-sector employees’ net income while working (CW
) are invariant, the former due to
spatial equilibrium and the latter due to political optimality. Since all workers pay the same
taxes, public-sector workers’gross wage wt needs to rise one-to-one with the present value
of expected house appreciation (i.e., by hx= [(1 h) (1 + r)]) to keep the two disposable
incomes independent of x.
Finally, the equilibrium impact of inherited pension promises Bt on house prices Ht is the
one that reconciles all the direct and indirect e¤ects outlined above with spatial equilibrium:

The left-hand side captures the bene…ts accruing to period-t residents through the housing
market. The …rst term re‡ects lower house prices Ht , and thus a lower user cost of housing
rHt = (1 + r). The second term is the present value of higher future house price appreciation
(Ht+1 Ht ). The right-hand side captures the cost borne by period-t taxpayers to …nance
the public sector, with a natural scaling by q. The …rst term is the direct e¤ect of inheriting
higher unfunded pension obligations Bt . The second term re‡ects the higher wages wt
that are politically required to let public employees, too, defray higher taxes. The last
and partially compensating term re‡ects the pre-funding of lower pensions Bt+1 for future
public-sector retirees.
The e¤ect of exogenous parameters on the link between inherited pension promises Bt
and house prices Ht is intuitive. The sensitivity increases with the size of the public sector
(@h=@q > 0) because a larger share of public employees makes any individual entitlement
more costly in the aggregate. It declines with pre-funding (@h=@ < 0) because it reduces
the fraction of any past promises that must be borne by current taxpayers.4 House prices are
less responsive when city growth is faster (@h=@ < 0) because the same burden is spread
over a larger number of taxpayers and houses.5 They are more responsive when the interest
rate is higher (@h=@r > 0) because the e¤ect of future house appreciation is then muted, in
turn muting the response of wages and pension promises.

3.5

Steady State

Proposition 1 establishes that equilibrium dynamics converge to a steady state by dampened
oscillations, since
h
Bt+1 B =
(Bt B)
(26)
1 h
4

In the limit case when pensions are fully funded ( = 1) there is no dynamic link between the policy
choices of each generation (h = 0), since each prepays entirely any promises it makes to its public employees.
5
The limit case of no city growth ( = 0) features precisely o¤setting indirect e¤ects: current wages wt
and future house prices Ht+1 rise, future pensions Bt+1 fall, but in equilibrium current house prices Ht
simply re‡ect the direct increase in Bt (h = (1
) q).

17

with h= (1 h) 2 (0; 1) for all q < 1=2. The core results of our model are the comparative
statics on steady-state values.
Proposition 2 In the steady state, public-sector pensions are increasing in the share of
public employees living in the city (@B=@ > 0) and in information asymmetries concerning
both wages and pensions (@B=@ w < 0 and @B=@ B < 0). They are decreasing in prefunding (@B=@ < 0); increasing in population growth (@B=@ > 0), in the reservation
utility (@B=@ A > 0) and in the cost of housing in the retirement destination (@B=@R > 0);
and independent of city productivity (@B=@Y = 0).
Consumption by public-sector retirees is independent of housing in the retirement destination (@CRP =@R = 0) but shares all other comparative statics with pensions.
Public-sector wages are increasing in the share of public employees living in the city
(@w=@ > 0) and in information asymmetry concerning wages (@w=@ w < 0), but independent of information asymmetry concerning pensions (@w=@ B = 0). They are increasing
in city productivity (@w=@Y > 0) and decreasing in the cost of housing in the retirement
destination (@w=@R < 0), while they are independent of pension pre-funding (@w=@ = 0)
and of population growth (@w=@ = 0).

The …rst set of comparative statics for public employees’earnings re‡ects the three dimensions of their political power. Naturally, the greater the fraction of public-sector workers
that vote in local elections the greater their clout over policy making: both their wages
and their pensions then rise (@w=@ > 0 and @B=@ > 0). Indeed, the political optimality conditions highlight that their consumption in both life stages is directly proportional to the index ~ of their voting participation, so their lifetime utility is log-linear in it
P
=@ log ~ = @ log CRP =@ log ~ = 1 and @U P =@ log ~ = 1 + ). In our model, public
(@ log CW
employees’wages and pensions tend to rise together as a consequence of the political power
of public-sector unions, rather than exhibiting a negative comovement, as predicted by the
theory of compensating di¤erentials (Smith 1981).
Proposition 2 stresses that political power derives from superior knowledge of policy
choices. Public employees’wages, and thus their consumption when young, re‡ect asymmeP
try in information about wage proposals (@w=@ w < 0 and @CW
=@ w < 0). Their pensions,
and thus their consumption during retirement, re‡ect both asymmetric information about
pensions and asymmetric information about wages (@B=@ B < 0 and @CRP =@ B < 0, but also
@B=@ w < 0 and @CRP =@ w < 0). The latter e¤ect is a consequence of the complementarity
between the two types of compensation: if public employees expect higher wages, they are
more aggressive in their pension demands because they know they can a¤ord their share of
pre-funding.
In terms of the primitive information structure described by lemma 2, all components of
public-sector compensation rise with the information-managing power of public-sector trade
18

unions (@w=@ U > 0 and @B=@ U > 0) and fall with the availability of public information through news media (@w=@ L < 0 and @B=@ L < 0). Producer interests can capture
policy-making over the issues they most care about without bargaining with politicians or
o¤ering them campaign contributions, but merely by disseminating political information to
their members, as Ponzetto (2011) …nds for the case of trade policy. Freeman (1986) reviews
the impact of public-sector unions on wages and bene…ts. In our model, when politicians
know that their proposals for public-sector compensation are widely broadcast among unionized public employees but relatively less visible to taxpayers, they make generous o¤ers to
avoid alienating the constituency that is disproportionately mobilized by these proposals.
Conversely, the more media coverage a policy issue receives, the more policy proposals re‡ect the general interests of taxpayers rather than those of knowledgeable insiders. Greater
shrouding of pension promises constitutes a decrease in transparency, and as such it entails
greater capture of policy-making by public-sector workers and a consequent increase in their
pensions (@B=@ < 0). Since the transparency of wage policy is una¤ected by changes in
shrouding, neither is the politically optimal wage rate (@w=@ = 0).
The e¤ect of pre-funding re‡ects an intuitive tendency towards de…cit spending in a polity
without intergenerational altruism. In our model, voters are never entirely oblivious to the
future cost of a pay-as-you-go pension system. They have a stake in the local real-estate
market, and they understand that high pension debt will weigh down the future value of
their own house. However, in a growing city they also understand that part of the burden
will be borne by the developers of new housing. The electorate doesn’t internalize the fall
in developers’pro…ts, and thus it is willing to accrue generous unfunded pension liabilities.
The more pre-funding is required, the less can taxpayers shift the cost of pension promises
onto future developers. As a consequence, political opposition to public-sector pensions
rises and their equilibrium level falls (@B=@ < 0), reducing public employees’consumption
when retired (@CRP =@ < 0). The same logic implies that pensions rise with city growth
(@B=@ > 0), so long as pensions are not fully funded ( < 1). Faster construction implies
that a greater share of unfunded pension liabilities is …nanced by developers instead of
existing homeowners.
The …nal set of comparative statics in proposition 2 concerns economic primitives. Higher
reservation utility increases public employees’welfare through a straightforward income effect: wealthier taxpayers can a¤ord to provide higher consumption to their civil servants.
Indeed, political optimality requires a constant ratio of public- to private-sector employees’consumption in all life stages. Thus, public employees’consumption is proportional to
P
taxpayers’reservation disposable income (@ log CW
=@ log A = @ log CRP =@ log A = 1). An increase in retirees’consumption coincides with an increase in the their pensions (@B=@ A > 0).
Instead, the e¤ect on wages is ambiguous, since public-sector workers’consumption already
rises through a decline in house prices, as shown below. Private-sector income and the cost
of housing in the retirement destination, instead, have no e¤ect on any resident’s net conP
P
sumption (@CW
=@Y = @CW
=@R = @CRP =@Y = @CRP =@R = 0). Hence, increases in the
retirement housing costs are re‡ected one to one in public-sector pensions (@B=@R = 1).
Private-sector productivity is re‡ected one to one in public-sector wage (@w=@Y = 1), and
so is the discounted value of retirement housing costs (@w=@R = 1= (1 + r)) because both
are identically re‡ected in the user cost of housing in the city.

19

The connection between the underlying political and economic structure and housing
prices is the subject of our next proposition.
Proposition 3 In the steady state, house prices are decreasing in the share of public employees living in the city (@H=@ < 0), in information asymmetries concerning both wages
and pensions (@H=@ w > 0 and @H=@ B > 0), in the reservation utility (@H=@ A < 0) and
in the cost of housing in the retirement destination (@H=@R < 0). They are increasing in
pre-funding (@H=@ > 0) and in city productivity (@H=@Y > 0).
The e¤ects of political power on public-sector compensation and housing prices are always opposite. The reason is that, in equilibrium, rents (or quasi-rents) are transferred to
public employees from developers. At the stage of political competition, electoral considerations pit public-sector workers against taxpayers. The former vote for higher bene…ts, and
the latter for lower taxes that would increase their lifetime consumption. Given rational expectations and spatial indi¤erence, however, such an increase in consumption is inconsistent
with equilibrium. The expectation of lower taxes due to lower public-sector compensation
instead leads agents to bid up the price of houses in the city. Thus taxpayers are essentially
running a proxy competition against public employees on behalf of developers. When fewer
public-sector workers vote and their information advantage is lower, the eventual outcome
is a rise in real-estate values (@H=@ < 0, @H=@ w > 0, and @H=@ B > 0). This result is
consistent with Gyourko and Tracy’s (1989) empirical …nding that public-sector unions earn
rents for their workers, and these rents are negatively capitalized in local land values.
The same distributional logic is re‡ected in the positive impact of pre-funding on house
values. If public-sector pensions are pre-funded, their equilibrium level is lower, implying
lower taxes and higher housing prices. There is, however, an additional e¤ect. A pre-funded
system is more e¢ cient than a pay-as-you-go system, since the former is …nanced at the
market rate of return r, while the latter has an internal rate of return < r. An increase in
pre-funding thus reduces the steady-state cost of …nancing any given level of public pensions,
yielding a further increase in housing prices. The overall e¤ect would become ambiguous
if the local economy had a growth rate above the interest rate. Leeds (1985) failed to …nd
evidence of a negative impact of unfunded pension liabilities on local property values. The
e¤ect of the growth rate itself is ambiguous for the same reason. On the one had, faster
population growth creates political support for higher pensions, which tend to depress house
values. On the other hand, however, it increases the internal rate of return of the unfunded
component of the pension system, which tends to boost house values.
Finally, the comparative statics on economic primitives follow directly from spatial indi¤erence. If the reservation utility of living outside the city is higher, the cost of living in
it must be lower, implying lower housing prices (@H=@ A < 0). If productivity in the city
is higher, housing prices must be higher so that real incomes are not (@H=@Y > 0). Since
we have treated the cost of retirement housing as an expenditure for city residents, but not
included it separately in the outside option, its increase also makes living in the city when
young less desirable, requiring a compensating fall in city house prices (@H=@R < 0).

3.6

E¢ ciency

As propositions 2 and 3 have established, there are two key interest groups in this model,:
the developer (or initial land owner) and public-sector workers. We consider two possible
approaches to e¢ ciency. The …rst and easier approach is to only consider the developer and
public employees separately. If the public-sector workers dissipate their rents through initial
competition to win the public-employment lottery, then developer pro…ts would be the only
measure of welfare. Alternatively, we can think of the result on developer pro…ts as informing
us about the institutions that the developer would choose if he had the ability to do so. Public
employees’welfare informs us about the institutions that public-sector unions would choose
if they were in control. Our second approach to measuring e¢ ciency relies on comparing
equilibrium outcomes to a counterfactual …rst best that maximizes public employees’utility
subject to the constraint that developer pro…ts are not lower than in equilibrium.

state (B0 = B). The value of B0 is irrelevant from the developer’s point of view: the present
value of his pro…ts depends only on steady-state values.
Proposition 4 The lifetime utility of public-sector workers is increasing in the share of
public employees living in the city (@U P =@ > 0) and in information asymmetries concerning
both wages and pensions (@U P =@ w < 0, and @U P =@ B < 0). It is decreasing in prefunding (@U P =@ < 0); increasing in population growth (@U P =@ > 0) and in the reservation
utility (@U P =@ A > 0); independent of the cost of housing in the retirement destination
(@U P =@R = 0) and of city productivity (@U P =@Y = 0).

which is decreasing in the share of public employees living in the city (@ =@ < 0), in information asymmetries concerning both wages and pensions (@ =@ w > 0 and @ =@ B > 0),
in the reservation utility (@ =@ A < 0) and in the cost of housing in the retirement destination (@ =@R < 0); and increasing in pre-funding (@ =@ > 0) and in city productivity
(@ =@Y > 0).
The comparative statics for the steady-state welfare of public-sector workers follow immediately from the analysis of their equilibrium compensation in proposition 2. Public-sector
unions would like as many of their members as possible to reside and vote in the city that employs them (@U P =@ > 0), so as to exert greater electoral clout. Moreover, public employees
obtain higher equilibrium compensation whenever they are more informed about policy proposals than other taxpayers, so their lifetime utility rises monotonically with any information
asymmetry (@U P =@ w < 0, and @U P =@ B < 0). Therefore, unions wish to convey as much
information as possible to their members (@U P = U > 0), while they prefer the news to be
as uninformative as possible (@U P = L < 0) and pensions maximally shrouded (@U P = < 0).
Public-sector unions also favor minimal pre-funding of public-sector pensions (@U P =@ < 0)
and the fastest feasible city growth (@U P =@ > 0), because both makes taxpayers less keen
on …ghting pensions promises, and therefore ensure the most generous pension provision
in the ensuing political equilibrium. Finally, public sector workers share one-to-one in the
reservation utility (@U P =@ U = 1).
Developers internalize exactly the cost of providing steady-state wages and pensions.
Their dynamics and the degree of pre-funding are irrelevant as such, and matter only through
their in‡uence on political equilibrium. Despite this di¤erence, the comparative statics are
identical to those of housing prices in proposition 3. The condition r > is now necessary
for the growing city to have a …nite value. The e¤ect of city growth has a new source of
ambiguity. As growth accelerates, pensions increase, unambiguously increasing the burden
of public-sector compensation. But as the growth of the housing stock speeds up, so does
the growth rate of developer pro…ts.
The institutional preferences of the initial developer are diametrically opposite to those
of the public-sector union, which is its long-run political rival. The developer prefers as many
employees as possible to be hired outside of the city, so they cannot vote in local elections
(@ =@ < 0). He wants maximum pre-funding (@ =@ > 0) to ensure that residents are
keen proxy …ghters in the political battle against public-sector workers. Minimal information asymmetries are optimal for the developer (@ =@ w > 0 and @ =@ B > 0), who consequently would like unions to have minimal ability to inform their members ((@ =@ U < 0).
Conversely, he wishes that the taxpayers who buy his homes were as informed as possible
about public-sector compensation policies (@ = L > 0), and particularly desires maximum
transparency of public-sector pensions (high (@ = > 0). Finally, the developer has an obvious preference for creating a highly productive city (@ =@Y > 0) and attracting residents
with poor outside opportunities (@ =@ A < 0) and cheap housing options during retirement
(@ =@R < 0).
22

Proposition 4 establishes that developer pro…ts are linear in the cost of public-sector
compensation w + B= (1 + r). Thus, our counterfactual measure of e¢ ciency consists of
comparing equilibrium outcomes with …rst-best outcomes that have the same cost but give
public employees the optimal consumption pro…les. Optimality is attained when consumption during retirement equals (1 + r) times consumption during working life. In equilibrium, public-sector compensation has a time pro…le

The ratio of public employees’equilibrium consumption when old to equilibrium consumption when young is a su¢ cient statistic for e¢ ciency. The welfare loss (U
U P ) is a
function of alone, up to the exogenous preference parameter , and it is single-peaked at
the e¢ cient level = 1 (@ U =@ /
1). The following proposition shows our results for
this second welfare criterion.
Proposition 5 In the political equilibrium, public-sector workers’ consumption is ine¢ ciently backloaded ( > 1). The degree of ine¢ ciency is is decreasing in prefunding (@ =@ <
0) and increasing in city growth (@ =@ > 0). It is independent of the share of public employees living in the city (@ =@ = 0), of the reservation utility (@ =@ A = 0), of the cost of
housing in the retirement destination (@ =@R = 0) and of city productivity (@ =@Y = 0). It
depends on information asymmetry exclusively through the relative asymmetry of information
about pensions compared to wages, and it is increasing in it (@ =@ ( B = w ) < 0).
Throughout the equilibrium path, and a fortiori in the steady state, public-sector workers
receive backloaded compensation. Their borrowing constraint is binding, and their equilibrium consumption suboptimally low while working and suboptimally high while retired. In
the …rst best, instead, all workers smooth consumption to identical levels during the two
stages of their life (for (1 + r) = 1). Thus, public employees could be made better o¤ at
no cost to the developer of to the taxpayer if their total compensation were kept constant,
23

but their pensions reduced and their wages increased. The political equilibrium is ine¢ cient
because it prevents this optimal readjustment, for two reasons.
First, the electorate fails to internalize the impact of current policy choices on future
developer pro…ts. Thus all voters prefer to reduce public employees’wages, which they pay
in their entirety, and increase public pensions, accumulating unfunded liabilities that will
partially be defrayed by future taxpayers, and ultimately re‡ected in lower prices for new
construction. As prefunding declines and city growth speeds up, the temptation becomes
sharper and ine¢ cient pension de…cits larger (@ =@ > 0 and @ =@ = 0).
The second source of ine¢ ciency is the shrouded nature of pension promises. As Lemma
2 their relative opacity makes it easier for the public-sector trade union to give its members an informational edge concerning pensions than current salaries. Thus, public-sector
pensions are more captured by public employees’than public-sector wages. Compensation
is backloaded to shroud it and confuse taxpayers about its actual cost. As a consequence,
ine¢ ciency would remain even if pensions were required to be fully pre-funded.6
Proposition 5 highlights that ine¢ ciency derives not merely from asymmetric information
across voters, but crucially from di¤erential asymmetry across voters and policies. The
impact is precisely summarized by the relative asymmetry of information about pensions
compared to wages. Lemma 2 then implies that ine¢ ciency rises with shrouding (@ =@ <
0), but also with the informativeness of either source (@ =@ L > 0 and @ =@ U > 0).
There is no guarantee that transparency, naively construed, should increase the e¢ ciency of
public-sector compensation policies. On the contrary, ine¢ ciency rises if taxpayers receive
new information, but the additional information is as skewed towards wages as their original
knowledge (higher L , constant ). Public employees do su¤er a decline in their overall
bene…ts, but they respond to the increased pressure by obtaining bene…ts that are ever more
skewed towards shrouded entitlements. An increase in e¢ ciency derives only from targeted
transparency on the more opaque and distorted policy dimension (higher ).
The distinction between e¢ cient and ine¢ cient news coverage is precisely the point where
developer pro…ts and aggregate e¢ ciency diverge. The developer aims at an across-theboard reduction in public employees’compensation. Consequently he appreciates, and would
promote if possible, any disclosure, whether focused on pensions or wages (@ = > 0 and
@ = L > 0). Instead, e¢ ciency increases when pensions fall but wages rises, and thus when
the former become more visible but the latter less (@ =@ < 0 but @ = L > 0). Despite this
crucial discrepancy, developer pro…ts are a somewhat better guide to overall e¢ ciency than
public employees’ welfare. Developer incentives are always aligned with e¢ ciency when it
comes to prefunding ( ), shrouding ( ) and union power ( U ), and they need not be opposed
in the case of city growth ( ). In all four cases the public-sector trade union unambiguously
prefers an ine¢ cient institutional environment. Only for the reduced disclosure of wages
( L ) do the union’s preferences coincide with e¢ ciency.
The comparison of propositions 4 and 5 …nally highlights the presence of purely redistributive con‡ict, separate from ine¢ cient political frictions. The share of public employees
living in the city ( ) and the reservation utility (U ) are key determinants of bargaining
power, respectively political and economic. A rise in both weakens the developer, reducing
his pro…ts, and strengthens public employees, raising their welfare. None, however, has any

e¤ect on the backloading of compensation. This accords with intuition because we would
expect bargaining power to shape the sharing of surplus without ine¢ ciently dissipating it.
Although we have not yet turned to the topic of centralized pension bargaining, these
results already allow us to understand one major way in which states regulate localities:
prefunding requirements. As we discussed in Section 2, localities that participate in state
systems are subject to state rules about prefunding. These rules may be relatively lax,
because of high assumed returns, but they do represent some attempt to regulate localities’
behavior. Pre-funding is also a policy choice that in many cases only came about during the
1980s.
Prefunding has no impact on wages or the consumption of public sector workers during
their working life. Prefunding, however, reduces pension promises and the consumption of
retired public-sector workers, causing a decline of their lifetime welfare. As a consequence,
public-sector unions should typically favor laxer pre-funding rules, which are presumably
achieved in reality by assuming higher growth rates. Union power may also explain why
public-sector pensions have not followed private-sector systems in moving from de…nedbene…t to de…ned-contribution schemes (Poterba, Venti, and Wise 2007). Conversely, developer pro…ts increase with prefunding because of the decrease in pensions. Fiscal discipline
should therefore by the developers’mantra and they should push for tighter prefunding requirements. We think that these results do help make sense of the political divisions over
prefunding requirements.
What does prefunding do to the overall e¢ ciency of the system? As pre-funding increases,
the ratio of public consumption when young to public consumption when old increases. This
means that the gap between worker welfare, and worker welfare given the …rst best consumption pro…le has decreased. As such, pre-funding doesn’t just redistribute from workers to
land owners, it also increases the e¢ ciency of the system. This is one reason why prefunding
requirements may be so universal.
In the next section we turn to a broader discussion of centralized control over public-sector
pensions.

4

Decentralization and Control over Pensions

The primary purpose of the model is to enable us to consider the issues raised in section 2,
which highlighted the heterogeneity in local control over pensions. In our model, we assume
that there are two primary di¤erences between local and state pension setting. First, when
pensions are set at the local level, only a fraction of public sector workers vote in each
election because some of them live outside the locality. When pensions are set at the state
level, then all public sector workers vote in the election. Second, we assume that there
is a third source of information about pensions and wages when the process occurs at the
state level. Statewide news media cover statewide public-policy issues, which increases the
probability that voters know about both public sector workers and public sector wages.
Speci…cally, we assume that, in addition to the probability of being informed by local
sources, and independent of the arrival of information from those sources, every individual
has probability S 2 (0; 1) of being informed of statewide wage-policy proposals by statelevel media. As with all sources of information, pensions remain less visible, and the relative
25

probability of information through statewide news is only
S . This implies that with
centralization the information probabilities for taxpayers become

(35)

As in lemma 2, the distribution of information is summarized by the two measures of
symmetry. Denote the indices under centralization by Sw and SB , and under decentralization
by Lw and LB . The information structure then admits the following characterization.
Lemma 3 For any policy proposal, public-sector workers are more likely to informed than
taxpayers. Their information advantage is greater for pensions than wages (0 < SB <
S
w < 1). Information asymmetry declines when either news source provides more information (@ Sw =@ L > 0, @ SB =@ L > 0, @ Sw =@ S > 0, @ SB =@ S > 0) and increases when
public-sector unions provide more information (@ Sw =@ U < 0 and @ SB =@ U < 0). When
pensions are more shrouded, information about them is more asymmetric (@ SB =@ > 0).
The relative asymmetry of information about pensions compared to wages is higher when
pensions are more shrouded (@ SB = Sw =@ > 0) and when unions provide more information (@ SB = Sw =@ U < 0). It is non-monotonic in the information provided by each news
source, with a global minimum at ^L 2 (0; 1] and respectively at ^S 2 (0; 1].
Centralization reduces information asymmetry on all issues ( Sw > Lw and SB > LB ).
It reduces the relative asymmetry of information about pensions compared to wages if and
only if local news are su¢ ciently informative: SB = Sw > LB = Lw if and only if L > L , for a
threshold L 2 (0; max f S ; U g).
This lemma …rst replicates for statewide information the same results that lemma 2 established for local information. The only di¤erence concerns an increase in local news coverage
L
L
L . Under decentralization it always makes the two issues more asymmetric (@
B = w =@ L <
0). Under centralization, its e¤ect is ambiguous because taxpayers’relative information is
no longer …xed at . When they are informed by statewide news sources, an increase in
information from local news has a greater impact on the less visible issue, by the usual intuition of diminishing returns to information. Hence, the e¤ect on relative asymmetry ‡ips,
at least for lower levels of informativeness (@ SB = Sw =@ L < 0 for L < ^L ).
The second part of lemma 3 provides a comparison of information asymmetries with
centralized and decentralized policy-making. Diminishing returns, again, imply that the
statewide news source is more relevant for taxpayers, who rely on new only, than for publicsector workers, who also receive information from the unions. Thus centralization reduces the
knowledge advantage of public employees on all policy dimensions ( Sw > Lw and SB > LB ).
The …nal result re‡ects that the relative asymmetry in information about pensions and
wages can be attenuated in two ways: by making taxpayers more informed about pensions,
or by making taxpayers less informed about wages. In the limit as local news disappear
( L ! 0) decentralization induces complete capture of both policy dimensions by public
employees ( w ' B ' 0). Relative asymmetry is then minimized.
26

However, in the case we consider most realistic, local news are more informative ( L > ).
The empirical …ndings of Gentzkow (2007) and Snyder and Strömberg (2010) suggest that
local newspapers are the main source of information about state and local policy, which
would imply L > S . Informative local news imply that decentralized government lets
public employees capture pensions but not wage-setting. Then the relative asymmetry on
the two issue declines with centralization, as well as the absolute asymmetry on each.
We …rst turn to the impact of centralization on public-sector compensation and housing
prices
Proposition 6 Centralization reduces public employees’wages and …rst period consumption
if and only if the share of public employees living in the city is above a critical value w . This
threshold is increasing in the information provided by local news (@ w =@ L > 0) and decreasing in the information provided by statewide news and public-sector unions (@ w =@ S < 0
and @ w =@ U < 0). It is independent of all other variables.
Centralization reduces public employees’ pensions and their consumption while retired
if and only if the share of public employees living in the city is above a critical value B ,
decreasing in the information provided by statewide news (@ B =@ S < 0). When local news
are su¢ ciently informative ( L > L ), a reduction in public-sector pensions is more likely
than one in public-sector wages ( B < w ) and its likelihood decreases with city growth
(@ B =@ > 0) and with pre-funding (@ B =@ > 0).
The impact on public employees’ wages captures clearly the opposite pull of the two
political consequences of centralization. On the one hand, centralization empowers publicsector workers by enabling all of them to vote for the politicians in charge of setting their
salaries. On the other hand, centralization curbs the political power that public-sector unions
derive from superior information, by increasing the news coverage of policy issues that reaches
all taxpayers alike. The former e¤ect dominates in cities with a low share of public workers
in the electorate, and the latter in those whose employees are more likely to also be residents
( > w ). Centralization is more likely to reduce public-sector wages when local news sources
are weaker ( w =@ L > 0) and statewide news sources stronger (@ w =@ S < 0) because it then
implies a greater increase in taxpayers’knowledge and thus in their power. It is also more
likely to reduce wages when the union is stronger (@ w =@ U < 0) and exerts greater control
over local politics.
By the same mechanism, centralization reduces pensions in cities with enough public
employees in their electorate ( > B ), and this is more likely when centralization generates
more public information (@ B =@ S < 0). Indeed, in the regular case of informative local
news ( L > L ), centralization reduces public-sector wages whenever it reduces public-sector
pensions, but may reduce pensions alone ( B < w ). This is intuitive because, as we saw
in lemma 3, centralization then reduces information asymmetries concerning pensions more
than those concerning wages.
The in‡uence of city growth and pre-funding is somewhat subtler. In the equilibrium
described by proposition 1, pension promises are constrained by two costs o¤ the equilibrium
path. The cost of prefunding through higher taxes is symmetrically perceived by private- and
public-sector workers. The cost of unfunded liabilities through lower house appreciation is
less relevant for public employees, who are liquidity constrained. By reducing relative asymmetry between voters, centralization makes the calculus of political optimality of pensions
27

more responsive to their impact on future house appreciation and less to that on current
taxes. Thus, it is more likely to reduce pensions when their o¤-equilibrium impact would
be felt the most on house appreciation, namely when growth is moderate (@ B =@ > 0) and
pre-funding limited (@ B =@ > 0).
Proposition 7 Centralization increases house prices if and only if the share of public employees living in the city is above a critical value H , decreasing in the information provided
by statewide news (@ H =@ S < 0). When local news are su¢ ciently informative ( L > L ),
an increase in house prices is more likely than a decline in public-sector wages, but less likely
than one in pensions ( B < H < w ).
The e¤ect of centralization on house prices follows the familiar pattern. The more informative statewide sources, the more likely a reduction in the political power of public-sector
unions. Such a decrease, by reducing the government payroll, yields a corresponding increase
in house prices. Given that house prices re‡ect both the cost of pensions and that of wages, it
is intuitive that likelihood that centralization increases them should be intermediate between
those of reducing each component of public employees’lifetime compensation.
In cities with a very high share of public-sector workers in the electorate ( > w ),
centralization reduces their political power across the board, so that both their wages and
their pensions decline and house prices conversely rise. Yet, centralization need not be an
unmitigated harm for public employees. It can yield a decrease in pensions, but at the same
time an increase in wages. In fact, this pattern is consistent both with a decline in aggregate
compensation and a rise in house prices ( H < < w ), and with an increase in aggregate
compensation and a fall in house prices, when fewer public employees are local residents
( B < < H ).
The possibility of a decline in public-sector pensions matched by an increase in publicsector wages immediately suggests e¢ ciency bene…ts of centralization, in the light of proposition 5. We now turn to the impact of centralization on the welfare of public sector workers
and developer pro…ts. As before, we consider the value of the city to its developer in time
zero as one element in social welfare. Public sector workers present the second element in
total social welfare.
Proposition 8 Centralization reduces the lifetime utility of public-sector workers if and only
if the share of public employees living in the city is above a critical value U , decreasing in
the information provided by statewide news (@ U =@ S < 0). When local news are su¢ ciently
informative ( L > L ), a reduction in public employees’welfare pensions is more likely than
one in public-sector wages, but less likely than one in house prices, and a fortiori than one
in public-sector pensions ( B < H < U < w ). Its likelihood decreases with city growth
(@ U =@ > 0) and with pre-funding (@ U =@ > 0).
Centralization increases the present value of developer pro…ts if and only if the share of
public employees living in the city is above a critical value , decreasing in the information
provided by statewide news (@ =@ S < 0). When local news are su¢ ciently informative
( L > L ), an increase in public-sector pensions is more likely than a decline in public
employees’welfare, and a fortiori than one in their wages. It is less likely than an increase
in steady-state house prices, and a fortiori than a decrease in public-sector pensions ( B <
< U < w ).
H <
28

Comparing the …rst part of the proposition with propositions 6 reveals that the qualitative e¤ect of centralization on public-sector worker’s welfare is the same as that on their
wages. Identically, the comparison with proposition 7 shows that the e¤ect of centralization on developer pro…ts is qualitatively the same as its e¤ect on steady-state house prices.
Quantitatively, however, centralization can reduce public employees’pensions while instead
increasing their lifetime welfare ( B < < H ), through a more than compensating increase
in wages. Conversely, an increase in developer pro…ts is a stricter condition than an increase
in housing prices ( H < ). Centralization can reduce public-sector pensions enough to lift
steady-state house values, and yet reduce total developer pro…ts because of the ine¢ ciency
of pay-as-you-go pensions when the interest rate is above the growth rate.7
Proposition 8 attests to the distributive tension connected with the choice between centralization and decentralization. Developers (and taxpayers more generally) want centralization when they expect the reduction in information asymmetry dominates the increase in
the fraction of public-sector workers voting in the district ( > ). Public sector workers
have the opposite preference, and support centralization when they believe that their greater
voting numbers should dominate their reduced information advantage ( < U ).
Yet the …nal result also highlights the scope for consensual e¢ ciency gains. There is a
non-empty interval [ ; U ] for which centralization is Pareto e¢ cient. Public-sector pensions
fall ( > B ), house prices rise ( > H ) and so do developer pro…ts ( > ). But public
employee’wages also rise (~ < w ) and so does their lifetime utility (~ < U ). The decline
in pensions is more than compensated by the increase in wages, since under local policy
pensions are too high relative to wages. Intuitively, public employees are willingly trading
o¤ an ine¢ cient source of asymmetric political power, privileged information, for an e¢ cient
symmetric one, participation in the election. This creates aggregate e¢ ciency gains that
under some parameter values can be shared among all parties involved, leading to Pareto
e¢ ciency.
A starker result is obtained when we measure e¢ ciency by the welfare loss for publicsector workers compared to the …rst-best compensation pro…le that costs the same to the
city developer.
Proposition 9 Centralization reduces ine¢ ciency if and only if local news are su¢ ciently
informative ( L > L ). The threshold is always interior (0 < L < max f S ; U g). It
increases with the information conveyed by rival sources of information (@ L =@ S > 0 and
@ L =@ U > 0) and with the shrouding of public-sector pensions (@ L =@ < 0).
This results follows directly from lemma 3 given the equilibrium value of ine¢ cient backloading ( S or L ), which is determined by the relative asymmetry of information about pensions compared to wages. In what we consider the regular case of su¢ cient local information,
centralization is always e¢ cient in the sense of yielding greater consumption smoothing for
public-sector employees, although its e¤ect on their welfare and on the public-sector payroll
can change sign depending on electoral participation by public employees ( ).
Nonetheless, the proposition can also be read as a cautionary note against relying on
the notion that any increase in public information is always e¢ cient. As proposition 5
7

With full prefunding, or in the limit as ! r, centralization increases developer pro…ts if and only if it
increases steady-state house prices: H = .

29

emphasized, transparency is e¢ cient if it reduces the shrouding of pensions, but not if it
merely provides more information about wages. Proposition 9 shows that, if local media are
the main source of political news ( L > max f S ; U g), then the e¢ ciency of centralization
is guaranteed. If instead local coverage is is dominated by other sources of information,
centralization is e¢ cient only if the di¤erence between these sources is no too large, and
if pensions are not too shrouded. Otherwise, the ‡atter public-sector compensation pro…le
is obtained by local taxpayers who are uninformed about all policies, rather than by the
statewide electorate, whose knowledge becomes more skewed as it rises above a negligible
starting point.
Our model thus predicts that there are conditions under which centralization is e¢ cient,
and more restrictive conditions under which it is bene…cial for both sides, private developers
and public-sector unions. However, we do not know whether increased information or increased voting will be more powerful in the real world. We believe that the model has served
to highlight the relevant parameters which will determine the impacts of centralization. We
hope that this will inform future empirical work.
At this point, we turn to a discussion of the history of centralized control over pensions in
Massachusetts, California, Ohio and Pennsylvania. We discuss the …rst two states at length,
discussing their history and current systems. We then compare Ohio and Pennsylvania today.

Local Pension Funds and Consolidated State Control: Case Studies

After the Civil War, localities began, in a small way, o¤ering pensions to policemen, a
natural extension of the pensions already being given to war veterans. After those modest
beginnings, there were two great waves of state and local public pension expansions within
the United States. The …rst wave occurred during the Progressive Era, when states set up
pension schemes for teachers and other employees, and sometimes tried to regularize the
pre-existing local systems that focused on police and …remen. Between 1911 and 1915 alone,
23 states enacted legislation pertaining to teachers’pensions (Graebner 1978).
Perhaps the most important reason why Progressives supported teachers’pensions is that
they were seen as tools for professionalizing teaching and improving educational e¢ ciency.
Pensions, like any form of added compensation, might attract better teachers, but pensions
seemed to have particular advantages too. Pensions were thought to induce elderly teachers
to retire, and some believed that elderly teachers were less capable, particularly if they had
failed to embrace newer methods. Pensions were also seen as a tool for ensuring that teaching
became a lifelong profession, rather than a temporary job for young adults. While today we
might think that temporary teaching stints, like those o¤ered by Teach for America, are an
attractive option, progressives worried about the inexperience of the young. Some progressives even apparently thought that pensions might reverse the trend towards more female
teachers, and some saw male teachers as a critical element in professionalizing teaching.
Progressives were also attuned to European trends, and many European nations, including Russia and Italy, already had teachers’ pensions. Many, but not all, progressive also
favored social insurance, and public pensions can be seen as a form of poverty reduction. Fi-

nally, public sector workers, especially teachers, were often overrepresented in the progressive
movement, so that supporting public pensions was also sensible self-interest for many.
America’s enthusiasm for social legislation dimmed after 1921, but then awoke anew
during the 1930s. Dr. Francis Townsend helped lead a national movement for universal
old-age pensions that culminated in the Social Security Act. But state and local publicsector workers were speci…cally excluded from the Social Security Act, since the Federal
Government did not believe that it had the ability to compel states and localities to join the
system. This led a number of states, including California, to greatly expand public pensions
during the New Deal era.
This trend did not abate during World War II, as several states expanded their pension
systems during the war. One explanation for the war-time expansion is that pensions are
deferred compensation that provided a means of increasing e¤ective salaries without falling
afoul of national wage and price controls.
Since cities and towns often lacked the independent authority to establish their own
pension systems, state governments were typically involved from the start, even if their role
was limited to merely allowing localities to establish their own pensions, either on a cityby-city basis, or with state-wide legislation that provided a template for everyone. In some
cases, especially with teachers’pensions, state-wide systems emerged out of almost nothing.
In other cases, states …rst allowed localities to innovate and then tried to enforce some
uniformity either by imposing rules on local pensions, like Massachusetts, or by completely
consolidating the myriad local plans into a state-wide system, like Ohio. Of course, some
areas, like Pennsylvania, continue to have a large number of fairly independent local pension
plans.
In this section, we will begin with a fairly detailed case study of Massachusetts, which is
notable in that it is an early innovator and that it has produced a somewhat intermediate
system. We will then compare Massachusetts with California, another often progressive state
that took a di¤erent path regarding local pensions. We will then, far more brie‡y, compare
Pennsylvania and Ohio, two neighboring states with completely di¤erent approaches towards
local pensions.

5.1

Local Pensions in Massachusetts

In 1911, Massachusetts began its pioneering state pension system, but this was hardly the
beginning of public pensions in the Commonwealth. Soldiers in the Revolutionary and
Civil Wars had received pensions, and the annual budget set aside a small amount for
charitable pensions that were unrelated to public service. According to a 1914 Report of
the Commission on Pensions8 , non-military public pensions in Massachusetts really began in
1870, with a modest system for Boston police, which followed, by 13 years, New York City’s
pioneering police pension plan.
Municipal courts paid witness fees to policemen, and after 1870 those fees were deposited
into a charitable fund, to be used for “the relief of persons who have received an honorable
discharge from the police department, by reason of sickness, age or other disability, and who
in consequence thereof are in necessitous circumstances: and also to the relief of widows

31

and orphans in necessitous circumstances of police o¢ cers who died while in the service
of the city.” While home rule was limited in Massachusetts, this fund didn’t require any
incremental city spending and was enacted without any enabling legislation by the state.
It almost seems as if the city was just trying to do something reasonable with the ‡ow of
witness fee payments
The Massachusetts state legislation enacted its …rst real pension eight years later, when
it created a true pension system for Boston police. According to that act, policemen who
were disabled in the line of duty or who retired after 15 years could receive up to one-third
of their active pay. The funds for these pensions would either come from the charitable fund
established in 1870 or, if necessary, “any sums which may be specially appropriated therefor
by the city council.” Even though the pension system was entirely city speci…c, and paid
for entirely by the city’s own sources, the state established the pension’s existence and the
upper limit to its generosity.
This act set the pattern for the rest of the 19th century. In 1887, the state legislature made
Boston’s police pensions more generous, by increasing the pension payout to those policemen
disabled in the line of duty to one-half of their salaries. In 1892, the state legislature made
the city council (and general tax revenues) the funding source for police pensions. In 1880,
the state created a pension system for Boston’s …remen, essentially with the same terms that
were given to police seven years later.
These early steps illustrate the perpetually hybrid nature of local pensions in Massachusetts. The systems were entirely Boston-speci…c, but they still had state oversight, and
the state seems to have acted mainly to create an upper limit on pension generosity. These
early systems were pay-as-you-go, apart from the fund created with witness fees, so there
was relatively little scope for issues relating to the funding and …nancing of pension systems.
But gradually, the state expanded its pension policies beyond Boston. In 1890, the
state established a statewide relief association for …remen, funded by taxes on …re insurance
companies, that would deliver assistance to …remen state-wide on an ad hoc basis. In 1892,
the state legislature began passing enabling legislation that empowered, but did not require,
other cities with over 75,000 inhabitants to create pension systems similar to those already
existing in Boston. In 1900, cities outside of Boston were similarly allowed to pension …remen.
In 1901, pensions for disabled policemen were enabled in every city and town throughout
the state. The language of the act is a bit more forceful: “In every city and town, the board
or o¢ cial having authority to make appointments to the police department shall retire from
further service therein any member who shall be certi…ed by the city or town physician and
by two other physicians to be permanently incapacitated, either mentally or physically, by
injuries sustained in the actual performance of duty in the department; and the member
so retired shall receive annually one half the compensation received by him at the time of
his retirement.” While this sounds like a pension mandate, the act only takes e¤ect if it is
approved by the city council (in the case of a city) or town vote (in the case of the town),
essentially maintaining abundant local control. Yet, while the local governments had the
power not to enact a police pension scheme, they had to follow the state’s rules if they did
want a pension system. Again, there was no provision for funding future pension obligations.
In 1904, towns were also allowed to pension both police and …remen who retired without
disability. There was also a perpetual stream of individual pensions approved by the state
legislature for individuals who did not …t exactly into the existing legislation.
32

To a certain extent, the pensioning of police and …remen was a natural extension of the
pensioning of soldiers. These professions carried considerable risk, and it seemed just to
provide some insurance against the dangers faced while serving the state. The move from
disability-based pensions to pensions based on length of service was a bit of a leap in all
three cases. But Civil War veterans represented a large and well organized voting bloc able
to extract considerable generosity from the government, and if the war veterans got old-age
pensions, then it may have seemed natural to grant similar pensions to the veterans of local
…res and violence.
The next great leap occurred in 1900, when the state established a retirement fund for
Boston’s public school teachers. While the police and military pensions were funded by
general revenues, the retirement fund for Boston teachers was to be funded primarily by
the teachers’own payments: three dollars every other month. This appears to be the …rst
major contributory system in the state. Teachers were expected to retire after 30 years,
and to have paid 540 dollars into the system, but there was a provision enabling the fund’s
board of trustees to waive this requirement in case of need. The pension payments went
unspeci…ed; they were to be determined by the board of trustees “as the fund will allow.”
The law speci…ed the rules selecting the trustees, which must include both male and female
teachers, and the trustees determined the investment policies of the fund.
But this system didn’t last long. By 1908, the state legislature moved Boston’s teachers
to a …xed pension, of $180 per year ($4,320 in present-day dollars), for teachers retiring
after 30 years. The pension was to be funded through the contributory retirement fund, and
through an increased property tax on the city. In the same year, the legislature enabled
other cities and towns to establish their own pension systems, funded with general revenues
on a pay-as-you-go-basis, which paid up to one-half the teachers’…nal salary.
In 1910, the state passed enabling legislation for all cities and towns to create almost
modern pension systems for all of their employees. They were allowed to make the systems
partially contributory (payments could range from one to …ve percent of earnings) and to
pay for residual costs out of general tax revenues. In this case, the act speci…ed a minimum
payment (200 dollars per year), rather than limiting the maximum pension. The 1914 state
report on pensions noted that no city or town had actually made use of this legislation.
While these systems may not have appealed to local governments, the 1910 act provided
a rough template for Massachusetts’1911 system for state employees. The State Retirement
Board would establish an annual contribution rate, between one and …ve percent, which
could di¤er by class of workers. Those contributions would then be turned into an annuity
upon retirement, which would be matched with an equally sized annuity, funded with general
state revenues on a pay-as-you-go basis. In 1911, Boston also created a pension system for
ordinary laborers.
In 1913, the State took the even bolder step of creating a parallel system for Massachusetts
teachers. Again, employees were required to make contributions to an annuity fund, ranging
from three to seven percent of their income (the Board would later choose a …ve percent
rate). Again, these payments would be used at retirement to fund an annuity, and the State
would match the annuity payments out of general revenues.9 The somewhat remarkable
9

As early as 1920, the contributory portion of the plan was being lauded for its “scienti…c” soundness,
while the state’s portion was seen as posing a risky unfunded liability.

33

aspect of this legislation is that the state took upon itself to pay for one-half of the expense
of pensions for one particular class of local employees.
In the context of the model, the decision to enact a pension system seems somewhat
distinct from the decision about whether to increase pension bene…ts in an existing system.
Smaller localities may have shied away from enacting their own pension systems precisely
because they suspected that it would be di¢ cult to monitor. At the state level, there was
more chance of electoral oversight. It is also possible that there were enough teachers living
outside of smaller communities to weaken their political clout at lower levels of government.
While teachers had become entirely subsumed into the state system in 1913, cities and
towns either adopted their own systems, following the terms of the 1911 law, or did nothing.
In 1936, amidst the national groundswell for all-old pensions led by Francis Townsend that
led to the 1935 Social Security Act, Massachusetts again tried to prod localities towards
pension systems. In this case, the state legislature authorized contributory systems, which
public workers would contribute …ve percent of their salary to. Those contributions would
buy an annuity and the local government would match the annuity. Whereas the teachers’
system was a major transfer from state to local government, this system was just empowering
localities to form and fund their own systems.
The modern system was essentially put together in 1945. Again, the legislation was
optional, but it was quite clearly intended to create a “uniform” pension system. Again,
there were annual contributions of …ve percent, but the pension payment was no longer based
on the value of an annuity that could be purchased based on those contributions. Instead,
workers were guaranteed a …xed formula typically found by multiplying years of service times
two percent times an average of several years’peak earnings. In a sense, the formula had
moved away from “scienti…c” funding practices, towards a system that guaranteed a …xed
pension allowance.
The pension system was still voluntary, yet since 1945 the system has come to cover the
state. One reason for the law’s success was surely that the law mandated that this option
had to be placed on the ballot in every subsequent state election until every city or town
accepted it. We do not have good records as to when individual towns opted in— in at least
one case, the o¢ cial town records claim to have lost the date. It is clear that this law created
the core Massachusetts system where salaries continue to be negotiated at a local level, but
the rules regarding pensions are set at the state level.
The basic contours of the 1945 system are still in place. Moreover, Massachusetts is
still one of the states that has opted against joining Social Security, which means that
public pensions play a more dominant rule determining the earnings for retired employees.
There have been, however, adjustments to both the pension payout formula and employee
contributions. The pension formula is now considerably more complex and it depends on
the class of worker. The maximum pension payout now multiplies years of service by 2.5
percent, instead of two percent, but it can be lower for workers who retire somewhat earlier.
More signi…cantly, the pension system has had to deal with repeated funding crises,
supporting the model’s core assumption that the costs of a pension system may be di¢ cult to
forecast. Increased life expectancies were one reason for the funding shortfalls, but given longterm secular rises in life expectancy, some of that change should have even been foreseeable.
Some of the unplanned costs of pensions were met with increases to employee contributions.
The core pension contribution rate increased from …ve to seven percent in 1975, eight percent
34

in 1984 and nine percent in 1996.
But other costs were met by increasing the level of public contributions, and particularly
by switching from a pay-as-you-go to a more fully funded pension system. During the
middle 1980s, the Dukakis administration, and especially the Secretary of Administration
and Finance, Frank Keefe, focused on pension reform, both for the state and for localities. In
1987, the legislature …nally passed a plan that represented a watershed for pension reform in
Massachusetts. Not only did the state have to contribute to a Pension Reserve Fund, but the
state would also mandate local contributions to pay down their unfunded pension liability.
While membership in this system was technically optional, localities ultimately joined. The
result was that localities were told how much to set aside for their pension liabilities.
With that act, the modern system was fully put in place. While the terms of these
pension funds have been set centrally since 1945, Massachusetts continues to have local
pension funds that in many cases manage their own portfolios. Investing with the state’s
investment system is optional, unless the local board earns signi…cantly lower returns for an
extended period of time. Local boards do typically earn less, although these lower returns
may also represent a more risk averse investment strategy.
The degree of underfunding di¤ers from town to town. Some areas, like wealthy Wellesley
and Lexington, have funding ratios over 85 percent. Other, poorer areas, like Lawrence and
New Bedford, have funding ratios that are closer to 40 percent. Moreover, these funding
ratios re‡ect aggressive estimates of future returns (8.25%), which may well be at odds with
reality. State law mandates that they set aside funds to close the funding gap by 2040, but it
would not be surprising if this gap were pushed out further if returns continue to fall below
8.25 percent, or if localities raise insu¢ cient revenues.
The Massachusetts system is essentially a generous statewide system. The state takeover
in 1945 did eliminate vagaries in local systems, but it also produced a very generous pension
system that only began pre-funding its requirements on a large scale forty years after its
initiation. The Boston experience suggests that state control has probably restricted pensions
in larger cities, which have strong local unions, but quite possibly increased pensions in places
where local public workers are unlikely to live (including Lexington and Wellesley).

5.2

A Shorter Sketch of California

Like Massachusetts, California was a progressive state that moved into pensions early. Indeed, in the case of teachers’pensions, California preceded Massachusetts. In 1895, California
passed an “act to create and administer a Public School Teachers’Annuity and Retirement
Fund in the several counties, and cities and counties of the state.”The act entitled teachers
who had served twenty-…ve years or more to a retirement income of $50 per month, but
provided only modest means of funding this outlay.
Teachers who retired shortly after the law was enacted would have to pay a one-time fee
of $600, representing only one year’s cost of the program. The other source of revenues was
a one-percent levy on teachers’wages, which again seems insu¢ cient to pay for the pension
program. Perhaps recognizing the obvious insolvency of the plan, the legislature directed
local treasurers to pay retirees in the form of warrants, paying …ve percent interest, which
would be “paid in order of registration.”
This act was ambitious but it seemed to ensure ongoing …scal uncertainty for retiring
35

teachers. Eighteen years later, the state repealed the 1895 act and enacted the current
teachers’ retirement system, in exactly the same year as Massachusetts’ plan. The plan
o¤ered teachers who had served for thirty years a retirement income of $500 per year, making
it considerably less generous than the 1895 plan, since the $600 o¤ered by that plan in 1895
would have been almost $720 in 1913. But teachers were still required only to contribute a
relative nominal dollar per month.
This plan, however, did have a rather serious source of added funding. The state law
directed that …ve percent of all inheritance and transfer taxes would be given to the teachers’
retirement fund and suggested that the state legislature would make further contributions,
as needed. There may have been an extremely tenuous link between inheritance taxes and
teachers, but California has established a feasible system for teacher pensions. Like Massachusetts, California had completely detached teachers’pensions from local control.
The 1913 law is seen as the founding of the current California teachers’retirement system
(CalSTRS) that continues to this day. Over time, there were considerable changes to the
structure of the system. In 1935 member contributions were raised to $24 per year, and in
1944 payments became proportional to teacher salaries.
In 1944 the state also dropped the link to the inheritance tax and instead adopted a
pay-as-you-go system, creating the possibility for more shrouding of the costs of teacher
compensation. In 1956 the state switched from a …xed annual bene…t for retirees to a bene…t
that scaled up with …nal-year salary. In 1972 the state saw that annual appropriations would
have to rise substantially under a pay-as-you go system and began pre-funding its obligations
to retired teachers. Since then the core system has remained unchanged, but California has
faced the continuing challenge of meeting its funding requirements.
While the California teachers’system has essentially been a uniform state-wide system
since 1913, pension for other local employees are far more diverse. In these other areas of
local pensions, California began with more centralization than Massachusetts, but ended up
with more local heterogeneity, perhaps re‡ecting the far greater heterogeneity of a much
larger state. California had police pensions before teachers’pension, just like Massachusetts,
but while Massachusetts began with a Boston-speci…c rule, and gradually invited other cities
and towns to create their own police pension funds, California created state-wide rules at
one fell swoop. In 1889, the state legislature passed “an act to create a police relief, health,
and life insurance, and pension fund in the several counties, cities, and counties, cities and
towns of this state.”There had been earlier ad hoc life and health insurance funds, but these
were now merged into these new, centrally regulated police bene…t funds.
Policemen would contribute two dollars per month into the fund, but this would be supplemented by a remarkable diverse list of other funding sources. The policemen’s retirement
fund was also the bene…ciary of, among other things, one-half of fees for dog licenses, all of
the receipts from selling unclaimed property, and the …nes for carrying concealed weapons.
Policemen were then to receive half pay upon retirement at age sixty, if they had served for
at least twenty years. All policemen paid the same amount to the system, but the bene…t
scaled up with the policeman’s …nal salary, making the system somewhat regressive.
But while California began with homogeneity, that homogeneity soon broke down and
the state did little to restrict local innovation. For example, the charter of San Francisco
altered its police pension system (raising the retirement age to 65 among other changes),
and this was held to be valid by the courts. The charter itself was not exactly a unilateral
36

act by the city; it had the approval of the state legislature as well.
Home rule became much stronger in California than in Massachusetts, and that tradition
may partially explain the greater heterogeneity of pension plans in California. Massachusetts
has a form of home rule, but it precludes, among other things, any ability of localities to
raise revenues or borrow without the approval of the state legislature. California has given
localities wide latitude, even to rewrite their charters. Since 1974, cities can rewrite their
charters without even the approval of the state legislature.
While there is considerable variation in modern pension plans across jurisdictions, the
state has typically enabled that variation to occur with limits. The Californian system
for police and other local employees, other than teachers, is regulated diversity. The state
legislature sets a template and localities have room to design their speci…c plans within those
limits, enabling some localities, like Stockton, to deliver particularly generous pension plans.
This diversity doesn’t primarily re‡ect the gradual creation of widely di¤erent structures,
which was basically the pre-1945 situation in Massachusetts. Instead, the California enacted
state wide plans and then allowed moves towards regulated local control. In 1919, the
State enacted a County Employees law that designed a pension system that counties could
voluntarily adopt, if four-…fths of the County Board of Supervisors voted to enact the system.
The Supervisors were faced with a take-it-or-leave-it o¤er narrowly prescribing a particular pension system that involved four dollar monthly deductions from employees’paychecks.
The county also had to match those contributions if the employee became disabled or served
for ten years. The contributions would earn interest and then be annuitized at the time of
retirement, which guaranteed that the system costs couldn’t spiral out of control. As is the
case of many Progressive-era reforms, good government concerns precluded incurring vast
future obligations. In the 1919 Act, counties’only pension costs that were not accrued at
the time the work was done related to workers who had less than ten years in the system.
Matching contributions were not made until the worker served for ten years, creating the
need to transfer a lump sum fund at that point, equal to the workers’ past contributions,
into the system.
While this proposal does seem to have been …scally sound, it did not seem to attract much
interest. The homogeneity of rules may have been one deterrent, although the four-…fths
vote surely was another. In 1937, California enacted the County Employees Retirement Act,
now known as the “37 Act”, which has enabled the creation of 20 distinct county retirement
plans, still in place today.
The 37 Act now has a wide range of county-speci…c rules, all set down in state law. In
1939, the state legislature enabled smaller jurisdictions, including counties, to join the state
employees retirement system (SERS, now CalPERS) that is in place today. The system
involves a number of generally applicable rules, but there is plenty of scope for negotiation
with CalPERS about the generosity of the pension plan. CalPERS is best seen as the manager of local plans, which have autonomy only within a band of possible contribution rates
and overall generosity. CalPERS typically requires local governments to make appropriate
contributions, but localities under …nancial pressure may choose to limit contributions.
One possible explanation for why the systems in California and Massachusetts have very
di¤erent degrees of central control, yet produce results that are not wildly di¤erent, is that
Massachusetts local governments (outside of Boston) are often quite small, while California
has number of very large county governments and cities. It is implausible to imagine that
37

there would be large media attention on the idiosyncratic vagaries of pension systems in
small towns, like Concord or Revere in Massachusetts, while there is at least some attention
being paid to large county systems in California.
The overall California system means that local governments today negotiate with local
unions over the generosity of the pension systems, as opposed to Massachusetts, where
outside of Boston they do not. On average, the Massachusetts system pays $21,500 in
bene…ts per active bene…t recipient. The California system pays $36,000 per active bene…t
recipient. This does represent a striking di¤erence, especially since overall earnings are
similar: median household income was actually higher in Massachusetts in 2010 than in
California.
These overall payment levels can combine a number of di¤erent local features, so it is
easier to compare the actual terms of Massachusetts and at least one large local system in
California. For a worker who retires at 65 with 40 years of service, the Massachusetts system
provides a maximum payment of 80 percent of pay (averaged over the last three years of
service). Cost of living adjustments are optional for the community, and in recent years, the
employee will have to contribute nine percent of earnings to receive this pension.
In Los Angeles, there are contributory and non-contributory options. The non-contributory
option (Plan D) will also delivery 80 percent of top pay to employees who retire after 45 years
of service at the age of 65. The employee will have to pay if he wants COLA adjustments, so
if anything this system is less generous in retirement than the Massachusetts local system,
but it doesn’t require any employee contribution, which is a very signi…cant di¤erence. If
the Los Angeles employee wants to contribute, then his contributions are still typically less
than in Massachusetts. The contribution is only six percent if the employee begins work at
age 25, and it only passes nine percent if the employee starts at 45. Moreover, the maximum
payment is 100 percent of pay, which is reached after 42 years of service. Altogether, the
plan seems substantially more generous than the Massachusetts system, and this is true for
a large number of local California plans.
This fact seems to support the view that local control can lead to more unsupervised
pension expenditures. Indeed, the California system may be the worst of both worlds. The
jurisdictions are large enough so that workers are likely to live and vote within their particular
county, but not large enough to have a dedicated media focused on delivering hard analysis
of pension deals. As such, the model would predict that this system would seem to generate
particularly generous pensions, as it does.
An added downside of California’s heterogeneity is that poorly managed governments
have the capacity to take on particularly onerous pension obligations. Massachusetts does
have communities that have more or less fully funded pension programs, but these di¤erences
re‡ect di¤erences in community …scal a¤airs, not di¤erences in the generosity of their pension
obligations. In California, communities like Stockton face pension-related …scal distress both
because of failure to fund and because of particularly generous plans. As such, even if the
average pension systems were similar, which they aren’t, California has more variance, and
that may be particularly harmful if distressed communities, like Stockton, cause particular
problems.
There is an added di¤erence between California and Massachusetts that makes pension
obligation far more di¢ cult to change in California: the so-called “California Rule.” Typically, employers have a legal obligation to respect pension that have been accrued, but they
38

can change the pensions associated with future years of work. However, in 1947, the California Supreme Court decided that the City of Long Beach could not unilaterally end its
pension system without compensating workers, even when those workers’pensions have not
yet vested. The original case was brought by a worker who was 32 days short of the 20 year
vesting period (Monahan 2012).
In a subsequent 1955 case, the court ruled that no part of a pension system may be
eliminated for existing workers, except if any reduction in bene…ts is o¤set by a comparable
advantage. This ruling essentially means that the full pension schedule is a legally binding
promise to workers on their …rst day of work, which makes reform particularly di¢ cult, at
least outside of bankruptcy. Massachusetts pointedly declined to follow California along this
path, meaning that pensions can be restructured, as they have been, with increasing worker
contribution rates for existing workers.

5.3

Ohio and Pennsylvania

While California and Massachusetts seem to point towards a positive connection between
decentralization and more generous patterns, we cannot claim that this represents a universal relationship, which suggests that in some cases added union power at the state level may
overwhelm the advantages of more media attention through centralization. The neighboring
states of Pennsylvania and Ohio are similar in many ways, but they are polar opposites in
the degree of local control over pensions. Pennsylvania is the extreme of local heterogeneity
and control, with over 1,400 distinct, locally administered pension plans. Ohio epitomizes
centralization, with a single state-wide system that covers all local employees, outside of
Cincinnati. That state-wide system was put in place in 1967 to address underfunding problems at the local level.
Despite the proliferation of Pennsylvania plans, the average generosity of these plans is
not particularly high. The average bene…t per bene…ciary is under $21,000 in 2010. Of
course, many Pennsylvania jurisdictions are considerably smaller than those in California,
and this may mean that workers live outside the area. Other possible explanations for why
local control has led to generous systems in California, and not in much of Pennsylvania, is
that Pennsylvania is poorer, and growing far less quickly.
To get an actual appreciation of terms, we looked at two Pennsylvania jurisdictions:
Pittsburgh and Luzerne County. The Pittsburgh system was reformed in 1987, and made
less generous. The post-1987 system is contributory, requiring four percent of the worker’s
salary. The normal bene…t after 20 years of service is 50 percent of average salary, but
workers earn an increment of one percent per year of service over twenty, so a forty year
veteran could earn 70 percent of peak salary. The one percent increment is capped at $100
per month, but that is not limiting except for workers earning over $120,000 per year. There
is a reduction in payments equal to one-half of social security payments received after age
65.
The Luzerne County system includes a contributory component of …ve percent or more,
and the retiree receives a pension equal to the actuarial value of that contribution plus
interest. In addition, the employee receives a pension of between one and two percent per
years of service, depending on the class of service. Thus a twenty year worker might expect
to receive 30 percent of …nal salary plus the accumulated value of total pensions.
39

The average Ohio annuity per recipient in 2010 was $22,500.10 While this is higher than
the Pennsylvania average, the numbers are not exactly comparable, both because of Social
Security, and because the Pennsylvania bene…ts number includes other bene…ts. Moreover,
the Ohio plan requires a fairly high level of member contribution.
The core Ohio plan requires a ten percent member contribution. It also o¤ers a range of
plan options, including one that allows members to direct their investments and a traditional
pension plan. The traditional plan o¤ers 2.2 percent of …nal salary per year of service, up to
30 years, and 2.5 percent of …nal salary per year of service after that point. As such, a forty
year veteran of the system can expect to receive 91 percent of …nal salary. Ohio workers do
not participate in Social Security.
Overall, the Ohio plan seems to be distinctly less generous than Pittsburgh’s plan, which
is particularly obvious for workers with less than 25 years of service, since the payment
is the same as a share of earnings and the contribution rate is far higher. Indeed, given
reasonable assumptions about the discount rate, the higher contribution rate in Ohio more
than compensates for the higher payment rate in Pittsburgh.
When comparing the Ohio and Luzerne plans, it is perhaps easiest to assume that, since
Ohio public employers contribute 14 percent of salary, they are paying for 60 percent of the
Ohio plan, and possibly more if the plan is underfunded. In that case, the employer-funded
Ohio plan amounts to around 1.4 percent per year of service making it roughly comparable
to the Luzerne county plan.
Overall, Ohio’s centralization does seem to generate distinctly less generosity than we
see in Pittsburgh pensions, but no more than in Luzerne County. Centralization of pensions
does not seem to be a magic bullet, but it does seem to avoid some of the more extreme
cases that do occur in Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania’s local control has also led some communities to get into particularly large
funding shortfalls. Some of the Pennsylvania cases, like Scranton, are especially extreme, like
those in California, and these extremes may lead to particularly bad local outcomes. Only
28.4 percent of Scranton’s pensions for non-uniformed employees are funded. By contrast,
the o¢ cial degree of funding in the Ohio system claims to be 74 percent. The Novy-Marx
and Rauh (2009) estimates are less than forty percent for Ohio, but presumably the Scranton
underfunding using their methodology would seem even more extreme.
These simple comparisons are not natural experiments, and they are not even properly
controlled regressions. They do, however, point out that centralized plans seem not to
have led to extreme pension generosity. Local plans can be modest, especially when (as in
Luzerne County) resources are limited. But in larger local jurisdictions, both in California
and Pennsylvania, the pension plans do seem to be quite generous, certainly more so than
the two comparison centralized plans that we considered.

Conclusion

This paper has presented a model of the political economy of public sector pensions. The
model suggests that pensions are likely to be generous, in part, because pension promises
are less easily observable than promises about more direct forms of compensation. The
10

https://www.opers.org/pubs-archive/investments/cafr/2010_CAFR_LoRes.pdf

40

shrouded nature of public pensions presents one explanation for why they are typically far
more generous in the public than in the private sector. The model also predicts that pensions
will be more generous when public-sector workers are more likely to live in the community
or when pre-funding requirements are lower.
In the model, pensions are ine¢ ciently generous. Redistributing between public-sector
workers and taxpayers could be either good or bad depending on one’s perspective, but the
model implies that public-sector worker welfare can be improved, holding total public sector
costs …xed, if pensions are reduced and wages increased. This …nding is corroborated by
Fitzpatrick’s (2012) …nding that many teachers are unwilling to buy larger pensions, even
at a small fraction of their total cost.
The implications of the model go far beyond pensions to all forms of compensation that
are di¢ cult to evaluate. Healthcare promises, particularly for retirees, are doubly shrouded.
They involve promises far in the future, involving in-kind bene…ts that are inherently di¢ cult
to evaluate. The shrouded nature of these bene…ts can explain why public sector health care
costs have been particularly high.
The model does not speci…cally discuss di¤erent types of public projects, but there as
well, shrouding should matter. If the costs of large-scale infrastructure projects are di¢ cult
to assess, then we should not be surprised to see that the public sector has a penchant for
such undertakings. Certainly, there has been a regular tendency to understate the cost of
these projects and overstate the projected revenues.
The results of the model enable us to analyze the choice of centralization over pension
rules. Centralization leads to more overall information and often less information asymmetry
between public-sector workers and taxpayers. Centralization also ensures that public-sector
workers will all vote in the election. The impact of centralization on pension generosity
depends on whether the informational force dominates or whether the impact of union voting
dominates. Since union workers are likely to live in big cities, we speculate that moving to
centralized control over big city pensions may be particularly likely to reduce generosity.
We then used the logic of the model to discuss four states. In two of these states,
Ohio and Massachusetts, local pension bene…ts are determined at the state level. In the
other two states, California and Pennsylvania, bene…ts are set locally. In our examples,
centralized control appeared to reduce pension generosity. If this conclusion is correct, then
it suggests the power of shrouding. A primary di¤erence between state and local control
is that state-wide institutions, including the media, will be focused on the costs of state
level compensation. This should have the impact of reducing shrouding and reducing the
back-loading of compensation.
Transparency is a watchword in public policy today, and this paper formalizes the costs of
limited transparency. Shrouding is the opposite of transparency, and in our model shrouding
creates the potential for considerable social losses. The remaining question is what institutions can signi…cantly reduce the adverse consequences of the shrouded costs of government.

Proof of Proposition 1

We conjecture that house prices are linear in pension debt
H (x) = H + h (B

(A12)

x)

where H > 0 is the steady-state house value and h > 0 the response of house prices to
inherited pension obligations.
This guess implies that the equilibrium condition for pensions also describes the linear
rule

B (x) =

where
~ q (1 h)
(1 + r) A
B =R+
(A14)
2
q) ( q + h) 1 +
w q + B (1
denotes the steady-state level of pensions.
Then the wage function must satisfy at the same time
(
)
R

+ 1 h h x1+rB (11+ )q x
,
w (x) =
r[H+h(B x)]

(A16)

to keep public employees at their equilibrium consumption ratio while working. The …rst
wage function draws a decreasing function of H: the willingness to pay by taxpayers as a
function of housing prices. The second wage function draws an increasing function of H: the
political demand of public employees as a function of housing prices.
The two wage functions coincide for all x if and only if h 2 [0; 1) is such that

The quadratic that de…nes h has a positive coe¢ cient on h2 . It is positive at zero (for

) q= (1 + ). Thus it has a unique root in [0; (1
) q= (1 + )]
and a negative slope at that root. Its comparative statics are unambiguous:
@h

Equilibrium dynamics converge to a steady state for all q < 1=2, which implies a fortiori
h < 1=2.

State employees (including state police) go through ERS
(Employee's Retirement System), though some State
agencies don't participate.
Teachers and judges have their own systems.
Localities are not required to join ERS, but if they do, ERS
has control over benefits and investments.
Localities seem to have freedom in determining contribution
rates, even if under ERS.
ERS is a defined benefit plan.
Montgomery, for example, has its own system.
Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) administers
benefits for "State of Alaska and political subdivisions."
Political subdivisions are cities, towns, etc. in Alaska. Some
entities, like teachers and judges, have separate systems.
Those entering service after July 2006 have a defined
contribution plan, before that date it was a defined benefit
plan.
PERS dictates benefits and contributions, and the Alaska
Retirement Management Board manages the investing.
There is a bit more investment flexibility for DC plans.
The Arizona State Retirement System is for both State and
Local governments.
Employers are required to collect and submit the
contributions by certain dates, or risk a fee or withholding of
money by the state. Investments are put into Arizona State
Retirement Fund.
The main pension program is a 401(a) defined benefit plan.
State and Counties are required to join APERS
There are separated plans for judges, police and fire,
teachers, etc.
Plan is defined benefit, with “defined contribution options.”
Localities can join voluntarily; however, one is hard pressed
to find any independent local systems (except for police and
fire).
APERS determine benefits though there is some flexibility in
how they are paid out
If in APERS, Board of Trustees hires an actuary firm to
figure out how much contributions should be and invests the
funds.
CalPERS covers state employees, and local governments that
choose to join. Judges and legislatures have their own.
CalSTRS covers teachers.
Many local places, including San Francisco, have their own
systems.
CalPERS dictates the benefit terms for its members (though

SS benefits.

ASRS participants
have access to SS

there are different plans within CalPERS)
CalPERS also has contribution requirements for its member
governments, but parts can be negotiated, i.e. the employer
might pay for part of the employee's contribution, or parts
might be influenced by collective
CalPERS also handles investments.At the end of 2011
proposed changes were suggested.
Public Employees’ Retirement Association (PERA)
“includes employees of the Colorado state government,
public school teachers in the state, many university and
college employees, judges, many employees of cities and
towns, state troopers, and the employees of a number of
other public entities."
Local governments are not required to join but can choose
to.
Many local areas have their own, such as Denver (DERP)
If under PERA, PERA dictates the benefits, the funding (8
percent for most members, and benefits are prefunded;
employer funding varies), and investments.
Member contributions earn a fixed interest rate
There is a state employee retirement plan. Teachers have
their own (http://www.ct.gov/trb/site/default.asp).
There is a municipal retirement system (CMERS), provided
by the state. Though many localities join, it doesn't seem
like membership is required.
CMERS has a defined benefit plan
If a locality is in CMERS, benefits are determined by
CMERS, there is a set amount to contribute, and the State
Retirement Commission manages investments.

State of Delaware has a state plan, along with a General
County and Municipal pension plan, along with a bunch of
others for judges, firefighters, etc.
The State of Delaware Board of Pension Trustees
administers the Delaware Public Employees' Retirement
System.
The plan’s board defines the benefits of the City and
Municipal pension plan which is a defined benefit plan.
Localities are not required to join.
The plan’s board determines contributions through an
actuary report and manages investments as well.
Florida Retirement System is the state level system.
Localities can join if they want.
It looks like benefits for localities are determined by the
localities. There is a lot of variation.
Local Retirement Board monitors all local government
retirement plans for soundness in funding. The Board also
rates the funds, but it’s not clear what happens if the Board
“fails” or get a bad rating. Also rates them.

55

PERA members do not
participate in SS.
Members of local
pension plans may have
access. DERP members,
for instance, have
access to SS benefits.

Most CMERS members
have access to SS
benefits, but some do
not. CTRB members
(teachers) do not
participate in SS.
PJERS members may or
may not have coverage each district has either
chosen to apply or not
to apply for coverage as
its own division. Some
CSERS members may
choose to opt out of SS,
while others participate.
Members of most plans
(state, state police,
judges, county and
municipal) have access
to SS benefits.
(Volunteer firemen
appear to not have SS
benefits.)

Members of Florida's
DROP have access to
SS benefits, as do most
members of FRS plans.
Teachers do not
participate in SS.

It looks like each individual plan makes its own investment
decisions as they vary greatly.
There is a general state employees system (ERSGA), as well
as one for public school employees, legislatures, judges,
military, superior court, and DAs
Georgia Municipal Association exists, but it not required for
localities to join Atlanta, for instance, has its own plan.
If a locality chooses to join GMA, GMA determines
benefits, contributions, and investments
GMA is a defined benefit plan.
State and county employees are under ERS (employees
retirement system)
There are hybrid, noncontributory plans and contributory
plans (employees are put into different plans depending on
when they were hired)
Different systems for police officers, fire fighters, judges,
etc.
It appears smaller localities (below counties), such as
Honolulu, also are under ERS.
ERS determines benefits and contribution, but there are
different plans and terms are different under each.
Hawaii Targeted Investment Program invests.
By law, "agencies of the State of Idaho and school districts
are PERSI members." Local governments can opt to join.
As PERSI’s plan sponsor, the Idaho Legislature is
responsible for determining the benefit structure.
The Board sets contribution rates for PERSI members.
The Board oversees investments. For member locations of
PERSI, there is a base plan (DB) and a 401k plan. 401k plan
allows for more investment flexibility.
Illinois has systems for the State, Teachers, University,
Judges, and General Assembly.
Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund covers all counties
except Cook County and all school districts except those in
the City of Chicago. IMRF is not a state entity.
IMRF is a defined benefit plan.
Localities may choose to join.
If part of IMRF, IMRF establishes benefits, controls funding
(with a 100% funding goal), and manages investments.
Indiana Public Retirement System (IPRS)
administrates/oversees nearly all the public retirement plans
(including state, teachers, localities, etc.) as of July 1 2011.
Teachers have the TRF (Teachers Retirement Fund), and
fire, police, judges and other groups have their own funds
under IPRS.Localities must join PERF (Public Employees
Retirement Fund) under IPRS.
There is both a Defined Benefit and an Annuity Savings
Account (ASA) plan
Employees must have both with required contributions to the
ASA.
PERF determines benefits and contributions
INPRS is responsible for investing for DB; ASA has more
flexibility.
Most state and local employees are in Iowa Public Employee

If a member of MERSLA, it determines benefits and
contribution rates.
MERSLA handles investments.
"Since 1942, the Maine Public Employees Retirement

System (MERS of Michigan), but it is not required, as
Detroit has its own system. It's a public company since 1996.
There are DB, DC, and Hybrid plans, with some flexibility
of choice.

the plans.
PERS (Public Employee Retirement Systems) covers almost
all public employees, and offers a DB plan.
For employees hired before the individual municipality plan
was closed, they are grandfathered in to the old city plan
with its contribution rates and benefits. New employees go
under PERS.
PERS determines benefits, but localities have some
flexibility at the local level. May be different for the
grandfathered employees under old defunct municipal plans.

State law says the employee must pay in 4% but the
employer payment can vary. It appears this 4% rule extends
to local governments that are not party of LGERS.
LAGER has its own investment portfolio.
PERS covers state, university of Montana, local
governments and some school districts, under MPERA
(Montana Public Employee Retirement Administration).
Also under MPERA, systems for judges, police officers,

investment fund.
New Hampshire Retirement System is for state, teachers,
police and fire, and participating smaller localities, and is a
contributory defined benefit plan.
Most smaller localities participate in the NHRS, but it's not
required.
NHRS determines for its members benefits and contribution
rates and manages the system and investments through a
board of trustees.
PERS is the general statewide system. There are separate
funds for Teachers, FF, Police, Judges
Joining PERS is optional for smaller localities, but it seems
like most do join.
Under PERS, benefits and contributions are determined, with
employers required to fund contributions each year. PERS
also manages investments.
PERS manages state, county, municipals along with
firefighters etc.
PERS determines benefits, with slightly different benefits for
different groups (i.e. firefighters) and some flexibility with
plan choice for the employer. They are defined benefit plans.

contributions. Rates can vary depending if it's state, county,
firefighters, etc, and there are a few different plans.
The Board, in investing PERA assets according to the
Investment Policy .
New York State and Local Retirement System (NYSLRS)
consists of the New York State and Local Employees’
Retirement System and the New York State and Local Police

New York City has its own, NYCERS. Under this system is
has plans for teachers, police fire, etc.
In NYSLRS, Tiers based on dates of hire determine benefits
and contribution rates
As for investments, New York State Common Retirement
Fund is for state and most local public employees. NYC has
its own system though, and manages it own its own.
State and teachers (who have their own). Also judges and
legislatures have their own.
Mostly DB, but employees can add DC/401k to supplement.
There is a local system (general and law enforcement) that
local areas can opt into. Seems like most choose to.
If a member of the system, it determines benefits,

Retirement System Investment Commission invests. DC
plans have more investment flexibility.
The South Dakota Retirement System covers state, local,
teachers, etc, and is a defined benefit plan.
Benefits are determined by SDRS and there are mandatory
contribution rates under SDRS.
SDRS also puts out a report for the government about the
unfunded liability.
South Dakota Investment Council (SDIC) manages the
portfolio.
The South Dakota Retirement System Board of Trustees is
the governing authority of SDRS.
"The Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System (TCRS) is
a defined benefit pension plan that covers state employees,
higher education employees, K-12 public school teachers,
and employees of political subdivisions who have elected to
participate in the plan. This means that the amount of any
future retirement benefits is determined by a benefit formula
rather than an account balance."
The City of Memphis has their own system. However, due to
unfunded pension liability, the cities made changes to the
plan last year. This didn't appear to come down as a mandate
from the state, however, nor were they forced to join TCRS.
If local government elects to participate, benefits determined
by TCRS. The plan is DB but there are contributory and noncontributory plans that the local government can choose.
If local government elects to participate, contributions of 5%
are required. The plan is DB but there are contributory and
non-contributory plans that the local government can choose

There is a state wide pension system, one for teachers, and
one for emergency services.
The Texas municipal retirement system is not required for
localities.
Also a county and district plan, also not required. TCDRS is
not state funded but looked at by the legislature.
It seems some benefits are the same for all cities, if you join
TMRS, but cities do have some flexibility. Not for TCDRS,
as the county/district determines benefits.
It appears cities determine the contribution rate. In TCDRS,
there is a requirement that 100% must be paid.
If a member of TMRS, it determines the investments.
There is a Public Employees system for state, local and
teachers, then others for judges, public safety, etc. There is
both a contributory and a noncontributory plan for Public
Employees. New employees must choose the DC or Hybrid
(401 and pension) plans. Employees before July 1, 2011
have the Tier 1 (pension only plan)..
Benefits and contributions are determined for everyone
under the plan.
If employers choose defined contribution under the system,
