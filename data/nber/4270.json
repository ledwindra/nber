Using a 107 country panel data set covering 1960-85, we find that\nhigh birth rates appear to reduce economic growth through investment effects\nand possibly through \"capital dilution\", although classic resource dilution is not\nevident in the data. Most significantly, however, birth rate declines have a\nstrong medium-term positive impact on per capita income growth through\nlabour supply or \"dependency\" effects.\n\n",
