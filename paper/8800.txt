A Rehabilitation of Monetary Policy in the 1950s

ABSTRACT
Monetary policy in the United States in the 1950s was remarkably modern. Analysis of Federal
Reserve records shows that policymakers had an overarching aversion to inflation and were willing to
accept significant costs to prevent it from rising to even moderate levels. This aversion to inflation was
the result of policymakers' beliefs that higher inflation could not raise output in the long run, that the level
of output that would trigger increases in inflation was only moderate, and that inflation had large real
costs in the medium and long runs. Furthermore, both narrative and empirical analysis indicates that
policymakers were not wedded to free reserves or other faulty indicators in their implementation of
policy. Empirical estimates of a forward-looking Taylor rule show that policymakers in the 1950s raised
nominal interest rates more than one-for-one with increases in expected inflation, and suggests that
monetary policy in the 1950s was more similar to policy in the 1980s and 1990s than to that in the late
1960s and 1970s. One implication of these findings is that the inflation of the late 1960s and 1970s must
have been the result of a change in the conduct of policy.

I. INTRODUCTION

American monetary policy in the 1950s has typically been either criticized or ignored. In
the 1960s and 1970s, economists tended to portray monetary policy in the 1950s as inept and
unsophisticated. Monetarists, such as Brunner and Meltzer (1964), argued that a mistaken focus on
free reserves led the Federal Reserve to misjudge the stance of policy and hence to make policy
mistakes. Friedman (1960) emphasized the stop-go nature of policy in the 1950s, which in his
opinion led to volatile output and bouts of inflation. Keynesian economists, such as Blinder and
Goldfeld (1976), argued that the Federal Reserve of the 1950s targeted output below the natural rate
and therefore unnecessarily restrained output growth.
More recent studies of postwar monetary policy have tended to ignore developments in the
1950s. While the inflationary policy of the 1960s and 1970s has received detailed study, the
possible continuity and change from the 1950s has received scant attention. One exception to this
pattern is a study by Calomiris and Wheelock (1998), which endorsed the Brunner and Meltzer
view that policy in the 1950s is best characterized as a continuation of the 1930s' misguided policy
of targeting free reserves.
The tendency of researchers to criticize or ignore monetary policy in the 1950s seems
strangely at odds with economic performance in this decade. Inflation, measured using the GDP
deflator, averaged less than 2.0% per year between 1952 and 1960, and never went above 3.3% in a
single year. Real GDP over the same eight-year period grew at an average rate of 2.9% per year and
the unemployment rate averaged 4.7%. While there two recessions during this decade, that in 1954
was exceedingly mild and that in 1958 was sharp, but very brief. And, even in the worst year of the
decade, 1958, the unemployment rate was just 6.8%. While this unquestionably good economic
performance is not proof that monetary policy was similarly good in the 1950s, it is certainly
suggestive. At the very least, it implies that those who would criticize or ignore monetary policy in
this decade are left with a mystery: why was performance so good if monetary policy was poor or

2

inept?
This paper suggests an alternative view of monetary policy in the 1950s, and hence a
possible solution to the mystery of the 1950s' outstanding economic performance. We show that
monetary policy in the 1950s was actually quite sophisticated.

Narrative evidence on the

motivation of monetary policymakers and their understanding of the economy shows that the
Federal Reserve of the 1950s was remarkably similar to the Federal Reserve of the 1990s. In
particular, the Federal Reserve in the early postwar era showed the same overarching concern about
inflation that is the hallmark of post-Volcker monetary policy orthodoxy. We also find that the
1

Federal Reserve of the 1950s was not wedded to faulty indicators in its implementation of policy.

Empirical analysis of the behavior of the federal funds rate confirms the view that the
Federal Reserve of the 1950s was in many ways more modern and successful than is usually
portrayed. Estimation of a forward-looking Taylor rule suggests that monetary policymakers in the
1950s responded much more aggressively to expectations of inflation than did policymakers in the
1960s and 1970s.

II. NARRATIVE EVIDENCE

Given that the time period is short, it is likely to be hard to test statistically whether the
Federal Reserve of the 1950s was blessed with good sense or good luck. For this reason, it is most
useful to analyze narrative evidence. The records of the Federal Reserve, specifically the Minutes
of the Federal Open Market Committee and the testimony of Federal Reserve Chairman William
McChesney Martin, can reveal both the motivation behind policy actions and the prevailing

1

Friedman and Schwartz (1963, Chapter 11) endorse the view that monetary policy was admirable in
the 1950s, but they suggest that the steady growth of the money supply was due more to good luck and
political pressures than to an improved understanding of the economy and a clear sense of the appropriate
goals of monetary policy.

3

framework used to understand the macroeconomy. The narrative record can also provide evidence
on the role that particular indicators, such as free reserves and nominal interest rates, played in
policymaking.

A. An Overarching Concern About Inflation
The most obvious and significant belief revealed by the Minutes is a fundamental
abhorrence of inflation by virtually all members of the FOMC. Indeed, in reading the FOMC
Minutes for the mid- and late 1950s, one periodically has to double-check the data on inflation.
The discussion was often so fervent and the predictions so dire that it is hard to believe that
inflation was actually very low. The overarching concern about inflation is revealed most clearly in
the statements the members made and the actions they endorsed during the times when inflation
began to accelerate, if only modestly, in the mid- and late 1950s. For example, in mid-1955 the
economy was quite well recovered from the recession of 1953-54 and there were fears that prices
were about to rise. Many members of the FOMC spoke eloquently about the need to act decisively
to prevent inflation. In August, Chairman Martin said in one of his rare prepared statements to the
FOMC: "Inflation is a thief in the night and if we don't act promptly and decisively we will always
be behind" (Minutes, 8/2/55, p. 13). In November, Mr. Robertson said, "I feel that there are
inflationary pressures present which should be checked now by a firmer monetary policy -- one firm
enough to curtail spending and thus dampen price pressures" (11/16/55, p. 20, emphasis in the
original). In response to these concerns about inflationary pressures, the discount rate was raised by
a full percentage point between April and November, and other contractionary measures were
taken.
The dislike of inflation and the desire to fight it were even more obvious in 1958. The
economy suffered a recession beginning in the fall of 1957. Almost as soon as the trough was
reached in the spring of 1958, the FOMC began to worry about inflation. The members felt that
they had not reacted soon enough in 1955, and they were willing to risk another slowdown and
Congressional anger to keep inflation from rising. Chairman Martin said: "he did not think that the

4

System had faced in recent years anything like the present problem, whether it be called an
inflationary psychosis or inflationary psychology. He did not know how to deal with the specifics
of the problem except by moving in the right direction within the System" (8/19/58, p. 59). In
doing so, however, the System would have "to have courage to assume the risks that were involved"
(8/19/58, p. 58). As in 1955, this concern over inflation led the FOMC to tighten significantly.
Indeed by September 1958, interest rates had risen back to their 1957 peak level and Vice Chairman
Hayes expressed concern that further action "could lead to interest-rate levels so high as to be
harmful to the economy and so high as to place the System in political jeopardy" (9/9/58, p. 12).
His concern, however, was not shared by most other governors. Chairman Martin responded that
"If the System should lose its independence in the process of fighting for sound money, that would
indeed be a great feather in its cap and ultimately its success would be great" (9/9/58, p. 53).
Governor Vardaman also expressed the view that fighting inflation was of paramount importance.
He said: "the country was going to have inflation and . . . there must be serious shock treatment"
(9/9/58, p. 27).
The concern over inflation and the desire for tight policy continued for most of 1959. In
February Mr. Leedy summarized his view of the role of monetary policy: "The System, of course,
wanted growth as well as stability, but if temporarily there had to be a choice between growth and
arresting inflationary psychology he would favor the latter course" (2/10/59, p. 22). In late May,
Vice Chairman Hayes announced that: "In the light of these threats to our economy, I am
convinced that the time has come for a decisive signal of the Federal Reserve System's
determination to do its part to check inflationary trends" (5/26/59, p. 17). In June, Governor
Szymczak said simply that the System "must not provide reserves to such an extent as to lead to
inflation" (6/16/59, p. 30).
While concern over inflation was clearly a key motivating force among monetary
policymakers in the 1950s, it was not the only concern. The FOMC also expressed concern over
unemployment and output growth on many occasions. As the evidence presented above makes
clear, the FOMC was often willing to overlook this concern about unemployment and growth if

5

inflation was high or rising. This sense that the output goal was subservient to the goal of
controlling inflation is also evident from a statement by Vice Chairman Hayes, who was one of the
more pro-growth members of the FOMC.

In January 1959 Hayes summarized his view of

monetary policy as follows: "as long as unemployment remains a problem, economic policy must
aim at expansion, provided additional employment does not produce an inflationary situation by
2

pressing against limited capacity of facilities and inelastic supplies of materials" (1/6/59, p. 7).

B. Model of the Economy
The narrative record also provides crucial evidence about why monetary policymakers in
the 1950s disliked inflation so. Their model of how the macroeconomy operated contained both a
remarkably modern view of the causes of inflation and a firm belief that the output costs of inflation
were large and imminent. As a result, they firmly believed that in fighting inflation they were
encouraging both short-run stability and long-run growth.
A central characteristic of the model of many members of the FOMC was a sensible view of
capacity or full employment. Most policymakers appeared to believe that inflation began to rise
when there was still significant unemployment.

For example, in July 1955, when the

unemployment rate was 4.0%, Vice Chairman Sproul said that the economy was "nearer than we
have been since early 1953 to full utilization of plant, equipment, and manpower; prices which have
been stable, in the aggregate, for two years may be about to get a push on the up-side due to
pressure from costs and from anticipation of price rises by businessmen, purchasing agents, and
consumers" (7/12/55, pp. 26-27). At the next meeting, Mr. Bryan said that "the apparent present
trends in the economy simply extend themselves to over-reach comfortable capacity and that,
accordingly, an inflation is inevitable" (8/2/55, p. 23). Mr. Irons clearly subscribed to the same
view a few months later, saying: "The economy was moving nearer capacity in many respects, and
2

In addition to these two goals about overall economic performance, the FOMC was also quite
concerned with generally maintaining stability in the bond market and especially with avoiding tightening
around times of large Treasury refinancing operations.

6

as this point approached less efficient means of production would be utilized and prices would tend
to rise" (10/4/55, p. 8). Again in 1959 when the unemployment rate was 5.0%, Mr. Thomas, the
chief economist, said: "The economy is approaching the limits of resource utilization" (6/16/59, p.
6).
The members of the FOMC and the Board staff were certainly aware that there was a shortrun trade-off between inflation and output. However, they were united in believing adamantly that
there was not a positive long-run trade-off. Indeed, by far the most common view was that if
excessive demand resulted in inflation, output would actually fall in the long run. This view is
similar to those of many current monetary policymakers, such as Alan Greenspan (see, for example,
Greenspan, 1997).
This was clearly Chairman Martin's view. Martin said in 1958: "If inflation should begin to
develop again, it might be that the number of unemployed would be temporarily reduced to four
million [from the current level of 5 million], or some figure in that range, but there would be a
larger amount of unemployment for a long time to come. If inflation should really get a head of
steam up, unemployment might rise to ten million or fifteen million" (8/19/58, p. 57). Martin
repeated this view in Congressional testimony in 1959, saying: "If total demands tend to run ahead
of the output potential, the general price level will begin to rise and this, in turn, will have an
adverse impact both on growth of demands and on means of financing increased and improved
capacity. It will also have adverse effects on the efficiency with which resources are utilized"
(Martin, 1959a, p. 118).
Two features of this framework are noteworthy. The first is that the level of inflation at
which Martin and others felt these negative effects were likely was very low. No one was
contemplating rates of inflation of more than 5 percent when making the dire predictions of longrun consequences. Second, the negative effects of inflation were thought to occur quite quickly.
Indeed, inflation could actually cause a recession. Martin expressed this view very clearly in
Congressional testimony in 1959. He stated: "I happen to believe, Mr. Patman, that the 1957-58
recession was a direct result of letting inflation get substantially ahead of us" (Martin, 1959b, p.

7

1285). Mr. Thomas, the chief economist, expressed a similar view and described the mechanism in
some of his presentations at the start of each FOMC meeting. In September 1959, Thomas said:
"Increasing demands after mid-1955 resulted in relatively small increases in output but marked
advances in prices. . . . Distortions such as undue inventory accumulation, too hasty capital
expansion in some areas, too rapid a rise in debt burden, and consumer resistance to price increases
undermined the prevailing high activity and led to the recession of 1957-58" (9/22/59, p. 8).
While the view that low inflation has rapid negative effects on output is not widely held
today, the belief in the absence of a long-run (positive) trade-off is certainly much more modern
than the simplistic Keynesian model that held sway in the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, many of the
statements made by FOMC members in the 1950s could be inserted into the narrative record for the
1980s and 1990s without notice. That the Federal Reserve had this model in the 1950s suggests
that the passionate statements about the dangers of inflation were not mere window-dressing.
Rather, they were part of a coherent view that placed predominant emphasis on keeping inflation in
check.

C. Implementation of Policy
Brunner and Meltzer (1964), Calomiris and Wheelock (1998), and other authors argue that
an important source of monetary policy mistakes in the 1950s and 1960s was a focus on free
reserves (total reserves less required reserves less borrowed reserves). And there is no doubt that
free reserves played an important role in monetary policy in the 1950s. For example, most FOMC
meetings ended with some discussion of a target for free reserves.
However, we find no evidence that this focus on free reserves was predominant or led to
persistent mistakes. Most FOMC members and the Board staff seemed to view free reserves targets
not as ends in themselves, but as merely the form in which instructions to the open-market manager
were couched. Following one of the frequent discussions of the deficiencies of this measure as a
target, Chairman Martin said in 1958: "these comments pointed up the problem of using free
reserve target figures at all. However, they had to be used as an indication, for that was the

8

framework within which the Account Management had to work" (5/6/58, p. 52). Mr. Leedy
expressed a similar view at the next meeting, saying: "He was not too happy about using the free
reserve position as a benchmark but in the absence of something better it seemed to him that it must
continue to be used" (5/27/58, p. 23).
Furthermore, the FOMC also paid close attention to interest rates and goals for key interest
rates were often used as a supplement to instructions about free reserves. A very common
instruction was that the Account Manager should pay close attention to the "color, feel, and tone of
the market" (9/30/58, p. 46). To a large degree, this instruction meant that he was to watch shortterm interest rates. And often the role of interest rates was more explicit. For example, in January
1955, when Vice Chairman Sproul gave a detailed summary of what various terms such as "active
ease" or "restraint" meant, the behavior of interest rates was central (1/11/55, pp. 10-12). In March
of the same year, "Mr. Earhart said that he found it difficult to think of credit policy merely in terms
of the amount of reserves taken from the banks or furnished to them, or of the amount of excess
reserves or free reserves; to him, it was more definite to think also in terms of money rates" (3/2/55,
pp. 18-19). Toward the end of the decade, Mr. Bopp expressed exactly the same sentiment, saying:
"He would give more consideration to sensitive rates, such as the Federal funds and bill rates, and
to other indicators of the tone of the market than to the level of net borrowed reserve figures"
(5/5/59, p. 20).
There is also evidence that the Account Manager often followed the interest rate guidelines
over the free reserve targets. In June 1958, Mr. Irons said: "by de-emphasizing the statistic of free
reserves and being concerned more with the feel of the market and short-term rates, it [the Account
Management] had brought about a better situation" (6/17/58, p. 33). Again three months later Mr.
Irons commented: "Disregarding the volume of free reserves but watching rate movements,
particularly rates in the short-term market, he felt that the results of open market operations were
not too much out of line with what the Committee has anticipated" (9/9/58, p. 41).
Finally, the FOMC almost always discussed the implications of its free reserve target for
interest rates, and often chose the target for free reserves to try to attain a particular interest rate

9

outcome. In January 1955, for example, Martin asked the Account Manager what "operations . . .
might be followed for the System account to provide a minimum disturbance to the market during
the immediate future [that is, to keep interest rates steady]" (1/25/55, p. 9). The Account Manager
responded by suggesting a range for free reserves that would be consistent with that goal, and the
FOMC adopted a target within that range. And when the Committee expected a shift in the
relationship between free reserves and interest rates, it typically changed the reserves target. In
March 1955, for example, the FOMC expected that without open market operations, temporary
factors would cause a large fall in free reserves with only slight upward pressure on rates. Since the
Committee felt that some rise in rates was desirable, it decided to allow the large decline (3/29/55,
pp. 5-9).
These considerations suggest that while targets for free reserves were important in the shortrun implementation of policy, nominal interest rates were predominant over longer horizons. And,
since inflation varied little in the 1950s, a focus on short-term nominal interest rates provided a
good indication of tightness in credit markets. Furthermore, many FOMC members showed a clear
understanding of the distinction between real and nominal interest rates. Mr. Bryan, for example,
said in July 1958: "There has been continuous, pervasive, and increasingly convincing propaganda
to the effect that inflation is inevitable. That propaganda now carries almost universal conviction.
Such an almost universal conviction means that the increase of yields on fixed income obligations
is destined to be greater than would be likely as an uncomplicated response to economic recovery"
(7/29/58, pp. 17-18). In 1959 Mr. Bopp said simply: "One reason for the present level of interest
rates is the anticipation of further inflation" (10/13/59, p. 15).
The FOMC was also acutely aware that the lags associated with monetary policy
necessitated a focus on future rather than current inflation. The members of the FOMC often
worried that inflation, while currently low, was about to take off. For example, in September 1958,
Mr. Leedy said, "the System should not postpone the matter of looking at the possibility of inflation
ahead of it. There were signs of recovery on every hand, and if the System should wait until there
was recovery beyond any shadow of a doubt it seemed to him that the System would have lost its

10

opportunity to do the kind of a job that it was supposed to be doing" (9/9/58, p. 32). Similarly, in
September 1959, Governor Robertson "expressed the view that the System ought to adopt an
affirmative position of restrictiveness in order to keep on top of the potential inflationary situation
ahead. Otherwise, the System would get behind the game and might never catch up -- repeating the
mistakes of a few years ago" (9/1/59, p. 21). Perhaps the best evidence that many FOMC members
put great store in forecasts of inflation can be seen by the criticism levied against them by a member
who did not. Governor Mills said in November 1959: "The most active proponents of this theory
lay greatest emphasis on the importance of formulating a monetary and credit policy that will act as
a backfire against an anticipated outburst of inflationary pressures, and in practice are apparently
prepared to take the risk that the policy actions which they support may miscalculate the future and
induce deflationary pressures" (11/4/59, p. 46).

III. STATISTICAL EVIDENCE

The narrative analysis indicates that the FOMC of the 1950s certainly talked much like the
FOMC of the 1980s and 1990s. To see if policymakers in the 1950s backed up their words with
actions, as the FOMC has in recent decades, one needs to supplement the narrative analysis with
statistical evidence. To this end, we look at how the federal funds rate responded to developments
in the macroeconomy in the 1950s and compare those responses with the responses in other
3

periods. Because the 1950s sample period is inherently limited and the variation in inflation in this
decade is small, this empirical analysis must be viewed as a suggestive check on the narrative
analysis rather than as a conclusive test.

3

Taylor (1999) shows that the response of the federal funds rate to economic variables provides a
sensible description of policy even in eras when the Federal Reserve was more directly targeting some
other variable.

11

A. Specification and Data
The particular specification that we consider is a forward-looking Taylor rule (see, for
example, Clarida, Gali, and Gertler, 2000). In its simplest, descriptive form, a Taylor rule shows
how the Federal Reserve chooses the federal funds rate in response to inflation and the deviations
of output from trend. A forward-looking Taylor rule takes into account the fact that the monetary
authority typically responds to expectations of these variables. As discussed above, this forwardlooking behavior was an important feature of monetary policymaking even in the 1950s.
The forward-looking Taylor rule that we consider is simply:
_
it = α + βEtπt+1 + γEt(Y - Y)t+1,

(1)

where i is the federal funds rate, π is inflation, and Y - Y is the deviation of output from trend.
Time is measured in quarters. To implement this specification, we regress the federal funds rate on
the leads of actual inflation and the deviation of output from trend, instrumenting with information
known at time t. For instruments, we use (in addition to the constant) the contemporaneous and
two lagged values of inflation and the contemporaneous deviation of output from trend. We use
multiple lags of inflation because the quarterly series tends to fluctuate substantially. The deviation
of output from trend, in contrast, is quite smooth, so the contemporaneous value is an excellent
predictor of next period's value.
Data on the quarterly average of the federal funds rate for 1954:1 to 2000:4 are taken from
4

Citibase. We extend this series back to 1950:1 using data from Martens (1958).

We measure

inflation as the quarter-to-quarter change in the log of the GDP deflator (at an annual rate). The
deviation of output from trend is calculated as the difference between the log of real GDP and a log
trend. The trend series is estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter applied to the period 1952:44

The data in Martens (1958) are reported only in graphical form. After deducing the numbers from
the graph, we checked and calibrated our deductions in a period of overlap between the series in Martens
and that from Citibase.

12

2000:4.
We estimate the rule over four samples. The 1950s sample is 1952:1 to 1958:4. We start
two years into the decade because the Federal Reserve was unable to pursue independent monetary
policy until the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord, which took place in 1951. We stop at the end of
1958 for reasons discussed below. The second sample corresponds roughly to the late 1960s and
the 1970s; it runs from 1964:1 to 1979:3. The third and fourth samples are the Volcker and
Greenspan eras: 1979:4 to 1987:3 and 1987:4 to 2000:4, respectively.

B. Results
5

The coefficient estimates are given in Table 1. The most important result is that the weight
put on expected inflation in the policy rule in the 1950s is quite similar to that in the Volcker and
Greenspan eras and noticeably larger than that for the 1960s and 1970s. In both the 1950s and the
last two decades of the twentieth century the point estimate is greater than 1, indicating that in
response to a rise in inflation the Federal Reserve raised the nominal funds rate by enough to also
raise the real funds rate. In the late 1960s and 1970s the coefficient is below 1, indicating that the
Federal Reserve reduced the real funds rate when inflation rose.
The weight on expected inflation is estimated less precisely in the 1950s than in other
decades. However, the point estimate and the narrative evidence presented in Section II tell a very
similar story. The Federal Reserve of the 1950s was deeply concerned about inflation and acted
aggressively to control it on several occasions. This can be seen in Figure 1, which shows the
federal funds rate and expected inflation (measured as the fitted values of the regression of the lead
of actual inflation on the instruments) during the 1950s. This figure shows that there is a close and
strong relationship between the two series for much of the decade.
5

We also run the regressions using the 3-month Treasury bill rate as the indicator of policy stance and
the deviation of quarterly industrial production from trend as the measure of the output gap. Neither of
these changes affects the results appreciably.

13

Part of the imprecision of the estimation is the result of the Federal Reserve being
particularly concerned about expected inflation in the late 1950s. Figure 1 shows that while
expected inflation derived from the first stage regression rose slightly in 1958, its rise was small
relative to the response of the Federal Reserve. As a result, this looks like a time when the Federal
Reserve was not responding to expected inflation.

(Furthermore, because expected inflation

derived from the first-stage regression falls in 1959, if one continues the estimation through the end
of 1959 the coefficient estimate on inflation in the Taylor rule falls considerably and is measured
even more imprecisely.) But, as described in Section II, the main reason for the tightening by the
Federal Reserve was its conviction that inflation was about to rise. In this context, it is useful to
note that the Federal Reserve was not alone in fearing inflation at the end of the 1950s. The
Livingston survey of expectations for the CPI six months ahead rose steadily from mid-1958
6

through the end of 1959.

Thus, the Federal Reserve was acting out of concern about inflation,

even if that concern is not captured by our regression estimates.
The coefficient estimates reported in Table 1 show that the weight put on the expected
output gap varied substantially from era to era. Both in the 1960s and 1970s and in the Greenspan
era, the weight is positive and significant, indicating that the Federal Reserve acted in a
countercyclical fashion. In both the 1950s and the Volcker era, the coefficient is essentially zero
and very imprecisely estimated.
For the 1950s this apparent lack of concern about output may be part of the general
imprecision of the estimates. Figure 2 graphs the expected output gap (that is, the fitted values
from the regression of the output gap at t+1 on the instruments) and the federal funds rate in the
1950s. The obvious positive correlation between the two series does not show up in the multiple
regression because of correlation between expected inflation and the output gap.

C. Policy Implementation
Data on key policy indicators can be used to supplement the narrative evidence on the
implementation of policy. Figure 3 shows monthly averages of the federal funds rate and free
7

reserves for the 1950s. One obvious characteristic of the free reserves series is that it is extremely
volatile. This is consistent with the narrative evidence that the FOMC often adjusted the target for
free reserves substantially to achieve a desired behavior in nominal interest rates. It is also
consistent with the discussions cited above that suggest that the Account Manager sometimes chose
to follow the interest rate goals and allow large swings in free reserves.
Figure 3 also makes clear that there is a strong negative correlation between free reserves
and the funds rate at longer horizons.

That is, while there is much short-run noise in the

relationship, over quarters and especially over years the two series consistently move in opposite
directions. This same relationship holds just as strongly if one uses data on the real funds rate
(calculated by subtracting off the measure of expected inflation graphed in Figure 1). This suggests
that in the 1950s a focus on free reserves did not lead to systematic misjudging of credit market
conditions and hence is unlikely to have been an important source of sustained policy mistakes.
The only prolonged period when the funds rate and free reserves are positively correlated
was 1956. During this year both the funds rate and free reserves rose substantially. This episode is
important for what it reveals about the relative importance that the FOMC attached to interest rates
versus free reserves. There is no evidence that the Federal Reserve thought it was easing over this
period. Throughout the year, the "Record of Policy Actions" describes the System's overall stance
as "a policy of restraint" or "restrictive" (Board of Governors, 1956, pp. 18-46). Indeed, the Federal
Reserve felt that it was increasing the degree of restraint over the course of the year. While there is
some variation in the strength of the stated commitment to restraint, overt decisions to tighten
further were considerably more common than overt decisions to loosen. The meetings in late
March, April, and August, which were followed by large increases in interest rates with little

The data on free reserves are from Meigs (1962, Appendix D, pp. 103-109).

change in free reserves, are particularly clear in this regard. The "Record of Policy Actions" for the
March 27th meeting states that the Committee felt that "the System would be derelict in its duty if it
did not exercise additional restraint." On April 17th, the Committee "agreed that there should be no
relaxation of pressures." At the August 7th meeting, it moved "to strengthen credit restraint." And
on August 21st, "The Committee felt that credit policy should be made somewhat more restrictive"
(Board of Governors, 1956, pp. 26, 28, 36, and 37). The rise in free reserves, therefore, was
evidently an accommodative move taken to achieve a desired behavior of interest rates in the face
of shifts in the normal behavior of reserves.

IV. CONCLUSION

Like central bankers of the 1990s, monetary policymakers of the 1950s had a deep-seated
dislike of inflation and acted to control it. Their dislike of inflation was rooted in a model of the
economy that emphasized the costs of inflation and the absence of a positive long-run trade-off
between output and inflation.
These findings may provide important insights into the performance of the economy in the
1950s. One key reason that inflation was low and steady in this decade was almost surely that the
Federal Reserve was working to achieve those goals. And one likely reason that recessions were
brief and mild is that inflation never got seriously out of hand. As a result, the Federal Reserve
never had to undertake a disinflation of the magnitude of those of the 1970s and 1980s.
This rehabilitation of monetary policy in the 1950s may also provide insight into the policy
mistakes in the late 1960s and 1970s. If monetary policymakers in the 1950s had figured out the
essence of sensible policy, the mistakes of the 1960s and 1970s cannot just have been the result of
continuing ineptitude or misunderstanding. Rather, something must have changed. One obvious
candidate for what changed is the model of the economy. De Long (1997), Mayer (1999), and
Taylor (1999) all suggest that a naive Keynesian model with an exploitable trade-off between

16

output and inflation, and later a natural rate hypothesis with an unrealistically low estimate of the
natural rate, was the key source of the inflation of the late 1960s and the 1970s. Our finding that
these models are so different from that in the low-inflation 1950s and post-Volcker 1980s and
1990s adds credence to this view.
