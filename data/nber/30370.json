    "abstract": "\n\nLittle is known about the pervasiveness or determinants of within-school ability tracking in the US. To fill this gap, we use detailed administrative data to estimate the extent of tracking in Texas public schools for grades 4 through 8 over the years 2011-2019. Strikingly, we find that ability tracking across classes within schools overwhelms sorting by ability across districts and schools, as well as sorting by race/ethnicity or economic disadvantage. We also examine how schools operationalize tracking as well as the local characteristics that predict tracking. Finally, we explore how exposure to tracking (and the bundle of associated practices) relates to achievement gains, finding that, on average, tracking increases inequality by slightly improving test scores of higher-achieving students without harming those of lower-achieving students.\n\n",
