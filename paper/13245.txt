ABSTRACT
We examine the relationship between monetary-policy-induced changes in short interest rates and
yields on long-maturity default-free bonds. The volatility of the long end of the term structure and
its relationship with monetary policy are puzzling from the perspective of simple structural macroeconomic
models. We explore whether richer models of risk premiums, specifically stochastic volatility models
combined with Epstein-Zin recursive utility, can account for such patterns. We study the properties
of the yield curve when inflation is an exogenous process and compare this to the yield curve when
inflation is endogenous and determined through an interest-rate/Taylor rule. When inflation is exogenous,
it is difficult to match the shape of the historical average yield curve. Capturing its upward slope is
especially difficult as the nominal pricing kernel with exogenous inflation does not exhibit any negative
autocorrelation - a necessary condition for an upward sloping yield curve as shown in Backus and Zin
(1994). Endogenizing inflation provides a substantially better fit of the historical yield curve as the
Taylor rule provides additional flexibility in introducing negative autocorrelation into the nominal
pricing kernel. Additionally, endogenous inflation provides for a flatter term structure of yield volatilities
which better fits historical bond data.

Introduction

The response of long-term interest rates to changes in short term interest rates is a feature of the
economy that often puzzles policy makers. For example, in remarks made on May 27, 1994, Alan
Greenspan expressed concern that long rates moved too much in response to an increase in short
rates:
In early February, we thought long-term rates would move a little higher as we tightened.
The sharp jump in [long] rates that occurred appeared to reflect the dramatic rise
in market expectations of economic growth and associated concerns about possible
inflation pressures.1
Then in his February 16, 2005, testimony, Chairman Greenspan expressed a completely different
concern about long rates:
Long-term interest rates have trended lower in recent months even as the Federal Reserve
has raised the level of the target federal funds rate by 150 basis points. Historically, even
distant forward rates have tended to rise in association with monetary policy tightening.
... For the moment, the broadly unanticipated behavior of world bond markets remains
a conundrum.2
Chairman Greenspan’s comments are a reflection of the fact that we do not yet have a satisfactory
understanding of how the yield curve is related to the structural features of the macroeconomy
such as investors’ preferences, the fundamental sources of economic risk, and monetary policy.
Figure 1 plots the nominal yield curve for a variety of maturities from one quarter—which we refer
to as the short rate—up to forty quarters for US treasuries starting in the first quarter of 1970 and

ending in the last quarter of 2005.3 Figure 2 plots the average yield curve for the entire sample
and for two subsamples. Figure 3 plots the standard deviation of yields against their maturities.
Two basic patterns of yields are clear from these figures: (1) On average the yield curve is upward
sloping, and (2) there is substantial volatility in yields at all maturities. Chairman Greenspan’s
comments, therefore, must be framed by the fact that long yields are almost as volatile as short
rates. The issue, however, is the relationship of the volatility at the long end to the volatility at
the short end, and the correlation between changes in short-term interest rates and changes in
long-term interest rates.
We can decompose forward interest rates into expectations of future short-term interest rates and
interest rate risk premia. Since long-term interest rates are averages of forward rates, long-run
interest rates depend on expectations of future short-term interest rates and interest rate risk
premiums. A significant component of long rates is the risk premium and there is now a great
deal of empirical evidence documenting that the risk premiums are time-varying and stochastic.
Movements in long rates can therefore be attributed to movements in expectations of future nominal
short rates, movements in risk premiums, or some combination of movements in both.
Moreover, if monetary policy is implemented using a short-term interest rate feedback rule, e.g.,
a Taylor rule, then inflation rates must adjust so that the bond market clears. The resulting
endogenous equilibrium inflation rate will then depend on the same risk factors that drive risk
premiums in long rates. Monetary policy itself, therefore, could be a source of fluctuations in the
yield curve in equilibrium.
We explore such possibilities in a model of time-varying risk premiums generated by the recursive
utility model of Epstein and Zin (1989) combined with stochastic volatility of endowment growth.
We show how the model can be easily solved using now standard affine term-structure methods.
Affine term-structure models have the convenient property that yields are maturity-dependent
linear functions of state variables. We examine some general properties of multi-period default-free
bonds in our model assuming first that inflation is an exogenous process, and by allowing inflation

to be endogenous and determined by an interest-rate feedback rule. We show that the interest rate
feedback rule—the form of monetary policy—can have significant impacts on properties of the term
structure of interest rates.

The Duffie-Kan Affine Term Structure Model

The Duffie and Kan (1996) class of affine term-structure models, translated into discrete time
by Backus et al. (2001), is based on a k-dimensional vector of state variables z that follows a
“square-root” model
zt+1 = (I − Φ)θ + Φzt + Σ(zt )1/2 εt+1 ,
where {εt } ∼ NID(0, I), Σ(z) is a diagonal matrix with a typical element given by σi (z) = ai + b"i z
where bi has nonnegative elements, and Φ is stable with positive diagonal elements. The process
for z requires that the volatility functions σi (z) be positive, which places additional restrictions on
the parameters.
The asset pricing implications of the model are given by the pricing kernel, mt+1 , a positive random
variable that prices all financial assets. That is, if a security has a random payoff ht+1 at date-t + 1,
then its date-t price is Et [mt+1 ht+1 ]. The pricing kernel in the affine model takes the form
− log mt+1 = δ + γ " zt + λ" Σ(zt )1/2 εt+1 ,
where the k ×1 vector γ is referred to as the “factor loadings” for the pricing kernel, the k ×1 vector
λ is referred to as the “price of risk” vector since it controls the size of the conditional correlation
of the pricing kernel and the underlying sources of risk, and the k × k matrix Σ(zt ) is the stochastic
variance-covariance matrix of the unforecastable shock.

This is an arbitrage-free model of bond pricing since it satisfies equation (1) for a given pricing
kernel mt . It is not yet a structural equilibrium model, since the mapping of the parameters of the
pricing model to deeper structural parameters of investors’ preferences and opportunities has not
yet been specified. The equilibrium structural models we consider will all lie within this general
class, hence, can be easily solved using these pricing equations.

A 2-Factor Model with Epstein-Zin Preferences

We begin our analysis of structural models of the yield curve by solving for equilibrium real yields in
a representative-agent exchange economy. Following Backus and Zin (2006) we consider a representative agent who chooses consumption to maximize the recursive utility function given in Epstein
and Zin (1989). Given a sequence of consumption, {ct , ct+1 , ct+2 , ...}, where future consumptions
can be random outcomes, the intertemporal utility function Ut is the solution to the recursive
equation:
Ut = [(1 − β)cρt + βµt (Ut+1 )ρ ]1/ρ ,

(3)

where 0 < β < 1 characterizes impatience (the marginal rate of time preference is 1 − 1/β), ρ ≤ 1
measures the preference for intertemporal substitution (the elasticity of intertemporal substitution
for deterministic consumption paths is 1/(1 − ρ)), and the certainty equivalent of random future
utility is
" α #1
α
µt (Ut+1 ) ≡ Et Ut+1
,

(4)

where α ≤ 1 measures static risk aversion (the coefficient of relative risk aversion for static gambles
is 1 − α). The marginal rate of intertemporal substitution, mt+1 , is
mt+1 = β

$

ct+1
ct

%ρ−1 $

Ut+1

%α−ρ

,

Time-additive expected utility corresponds to the parameter restriction ρ = α.
In equilibrium, the representative agent consumes the stochastic endowment, et , so that log(ct+1 /ct ) =
log(et+1 /et ) = xt+1 , where xt+1 is the log of the ratio of endowments in t + 1 relative to t. The log
of the equilibrium marginal rate of substitution, referred to as the real pricing kernel, is therefore
given by
log mt+1 = log β + (ρ − 1)xt+1 + (α − ρ) [log Wt+1 − log µt (Wt+1 )] ,

(5)

where Wt is the value of utility in equilibrium.
The first two terms in the marginal rate of substitution are standard expected utility terms: the
5

pure time preference parameter β and a consumption growth term times the inverse of the negative
of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. The third term in the pricing kernel is a new term
coming from the Epstein-Zin preferences.
The endowment-growth process evolves stochastically according to
1/2

xt+1 = (1 − φx )θx + φx xt + vt εxt+1 ,
where
vt+1 = (1 − φv )θv + φv vt + σv εvt+1
is the process for the conditional volatility of endowment growth. We will refer to vt as stochastic
volatility. The innovations εxt and εvt are distributed NID(0, I).
Note that the state vector in this model conforms with the setup of the Duffie-Kan model above.
Define the state vector zt ≡ [xt vt ]" , which implies parameters for the Duffie-Kan model:
θ = [θx θv ]"
Φ = diag{φx , φv }
Σ(zt ) = diag{a1 + b"1 zt , a2 + b"2 zt }
a1 = 0, b1 = [0 1]" , a2 = σv2 , b2 = [0 0]" .

Following the analysis in Hansen et al. (2005), we will work with the logarithm of the value function
scaled by the endowment:
Wt /et = [(1 − β) + β(µt (Wt+1 )/et )ρ ]1/ρ

(6)

where we have used the linear homogeneity of µt (see equation (4)). Take logarithms of (6) to

obtain
wt = ρ−1 log[(1 − β) + β exp(ρut )],
where wt ≡ log(Wt /et ) and ut ≡ log(µt (exp(wt+1 + xt+1 ))). Consider a linear approximation of the
right-hand side of this equation as a function of ut around the point m̄:

where κ < 1. For the special case with ρ = 0, i.e., a log time aggregator, the linear approximation
is exact with κ̄ = 1 − β and κ = β (see Hansen et al. (2005)). Similarly, approximating around
m̄ = 0, results in κ̄ = 0 and κ = β .
Given the state variables and the log-linear structure of the model, we conjecture a solution for the
log value function of the form,
wt = ω̄ + ωx xt + ωv vt ,
where ω̄, ωx , and ωv are constants to be determined. By substituting
wt+1 + xt+1 = ω̄ + (ωx + 1)xt+1 + ωv vt+1 .
Since xt+1 and vt+1 are jointly normally distributed, the properties of normal random variables can
be used to solve for ut :
ut ≡ log(µt (exp(wt+1 + xt+1 )))

We can now use the recursive formulas in equation (2) to solve for real discount bond prices and
the real yield curve.
Note how the factor loadings and prices of risk depend on the deeper structural parameters, and
the greatly reduced dimensionality of the parameter space relative to the general affine model. Also
note that for the time-additive expected utility special case, α = ρ, the volatility factor does not
enter the conditional mean of the pricing kernel since γv = 0, and also that the price of risk for
the volatility factor is zero since λv = 0. Finally, we can see from the expressions for bond prices
that the two key preference parameters, ρ and α, provide freedom in controlling both the factor
loadings and the prices of risk in the real pricing kernel.

4

Nominal Bond Pricing

To understand the price of nominal bonds, we need a nominal pricing kernel. If we assume that
there is a frictionless conversion of money for goods in this economy, the nominal kernel is given by
log(m$t+1 ) = log(mt+1 ) − pt+1 ,

(8)

where pt+1 is the log of the money price of goods at time t + 1 relative to the money price of goods
at time t, i.e., the inflation rate between t and t + 1. Clearly then, the source of inflation, its
random properties, and its relationship to the real pricing kernel is of central interest for nominal
bond pricing. We next consider two different specifications for equilibrium inflation.

4.1

Exogenous Inflation

If we expand the state space to include an exogenous inflation process, pt , the state vector becomes
zt = [xt vt pt ]" . The stochastic process for exogenous inflation is
pt+1 = (1 − φp )θp + φp pt + σp εpt+1 ,
9

where εpt+1 is also normally distributed independently of the other two shocks. In this case, the
parameters for the affine nominal pricing kernel are
δ $ = δ + (1 − φp )θp
γ $ = [γx γv φp ]"
λ$ = [λx λv 1]" .

In the exogenous inflation model, the price of inflation risk is always exactly 1, and does not change
with the values of any of the other structural parameters in the model. In addition, the factor
loadings and prices of risk for output growth and stochastic volatility are the same as in the real
pricing kernel. We will refer to this nominal pricing kernel specification as the exogenous inflation
economy.

4.2

Monetary Policy and Endogenous Inflation

We begin by assuming that monetary policy follows a simple nominal interest-rate rule. We will
abuse conventional terminology and often refer to the interest-rate rule as a Taylor rule. While
there are a variety of ways to specify a Taylor rule—see Ang et al. (2004)—we will consider a rule
in which the short term interest rate depends on contemporaneous output, inflation and a policy
shock:
it = τ̄ + τx xt + τp pt + st ,

(9)

where the monetary policy shock satisfies
st = φs st−1 + σs εst ,
and where εst ∼ NID(0, 1) is independent of the other two real shocks.
Since this nominal interest rate rule must also be consistent with equilibrium in the bond market,
i.e., it must be consistent with the nominal pricing kernel in equation (8) as well as equation (9),
10

we can use these two equations to find the equilibrium process for inflation. Conjecture a log-linear
solution for pt ,
pt = π̄ + πx xt + πv vt + πs st ,

(10)

with π̄, πx , and πs constants to be solved.
To solve for a rational expectations solution to the model, we substitute the guess for the inflation
rate into both the Taylor rule and the nominal pricing kernel and solve for the parameters π̄, πx ,
πv , and πs that equate the pricing-kernel-determined short rate with the Taylor-rule-determined
short rate.
From the dynamics of xt+1 , vt+1 , and st+1 , inflation pt+1 is given by
pt+1 = π̄ + πx xt+1 + πv vt+1 + πs st+1
= π̄ + πx (1 − φx )θx + πv (1 − φv )θv + πx φx xt + πv φv vt + πs φs st
1/2

+πx vt εxt+1 + πv σv εvt+1 + πs σs εst+1 .
Substituting into the nominal pricing kernel,
− log(m$t+1 ) = − log(mt+1 ) + pt+1
1/2

= δ + γx xt + γv vt + γx vt εxt+1 + γv σv εvt+1 + pt+1

1/2

+ (λx + πx ) vt εxt+1 + (λv + πv ) σv εvt+1 + πs σs εst+1 .

+From these dynamics, the nominal one period interest rate it = −log Et m$t+1 is
it = δ + π̄ + πx (1 − φx )θx + πv (1 − φv )θv
+ (γx + πx φx ) xt + (γv + πv φv ) vt + πs φs st

− (λx + πx )2 vt − (λv + πv )2 σv2 − πs2 σs2 .

These expressions form a recursive system we use to solve for the equilibrium parameters of the
inflation process. See Cochrane (2006) for a more detailed account of this rational expectations
solution method.
It is clear from these expressions that the equilibrium inflation process will depend on the preference
parameters of the household generally, and attitudes towards risk specifically.
In a similar fashion, we can extend the analysis to any Taylor rule-type that is linear in state
variables, including lagged short rates, other contemporaneous yields at any maturity, as well as
forward-looking rules, as in Clarida et al. (2000), since in the affine framework, interest rates are
all simply linear functions of the current state variables. See Ang et al. (2004) and Gallmeyer et al.
(2005) for some concrete examples.

4.3

A Monetary-Policy Consistent Pricing Kernel

Substituting the equilibrium inflation process from equations (10) and (11) into the nominal pricing
kernel, an equilibrium 3-factor affine term structure model that is consistent with the nominalinterest rate rule is obtained.

a3 = σs2 , b3 = [0 0 0]" ,
and the parameters of the pricing kernel are

We will often refer to this nominal pricing kernel specification as the endogenous inflation economy.
The Taylor rule parameters, through their determination of the equilibrium inflation process, affect
both the factor loadings on the real factors as well as their prices or risk. Monetary policy through
its effects on endogenous inflation, therefore, can result in significantly different risk premiums in
the term structure than the exogenous-inflation model. We explore such as possibility through
numerical examples.

Quantitative Exercises

We calibrate the exogenous processes in our model to quarterly post-war US data as follows:
1. Endowment Growth. φx = 0.36, θx = 0.006, σx = 0.0048(1 − φ2x )1/2 ;
13

2. Inflation. φp = 0.8471, θp = 0.0093, σp = 0.0063(1 − φ2p )1/2 ;
3. Stochastic volatility. φv = 0.973, θv = 0.0001825, σv = 0.9884 × 10−5 ;
4. Policy Shock. φs = 0.922, σs = (0.023 × 10−4 )1/2 .
The endowment growth process is calibrated to quarterly per capita consumption of durable goods
and services, and inflation is calibrated to the nondurables and services deflator, similarly to Piazzesi
and Schneider (2006). The volatility process is taken from Bansal and Yaron (2004), who calibrate
their model to monthly data. We adjust their parameters to deal with quarterly time-aggregation.
We take the parameters for the policy shock from Ang et al. (2004) who estimate a Taylor rule
using an affine term-structure model with macroeconomic factors and an unobserved policy shock.
Figures 4 though 7 depict the average yield curves and yield volatilities for different preference
parameters for the exogenous and endogenous inflation models. The top plot in each figure depicts
the average historical nominal yield curve with stars (∗∗), the average real yield curve common
across both inflation models with a dashed line (−−), the average nominal yield curve in the
exogenous inflation economy with a dashed-dotted line (- – -), and the average nominal yield curve
in the endogenous inflation economy with a solid line (–). The bottom plot depicts yield volatilities
for the same cases as the average yield curve plot.
Each figure is computed using a different set of preference parameters. We fix a level of the
intertemporal elasticity parameter ρ for each plot, and pick the remaining preference parameters—
the risk aversion coefficient α and the rate of time preference β—to minimize the distance between
the average nominal yields and yield volatilities in the data and the those implied by the exogenous
inflation economy. We pick the Taylor-rule parameters to minimize the distance between the average
nominal yields and yield volatilities in the data and the those implied by the endogenous inflation
economy. Table 1 reports the factor loadings and the prices of risk for each economy corresponding
to the figures. Table 2 reports the coefficients on the equilibrium inflation rate and properties of
the equilibrium inflation rate in the endogenous inflation economy.

14

Figure 4 reports the results with ρ = −0.5; here the representative agent has a low intertemporal
elasticity of substitution. The remaining preference parameters are α = −4.83, β = 0.999. With
this choice of parameters, the average real term structure is slightly downward sloping.
Backus and Zin (1994) show that a necessary condition for the average yield curve to be upward
sloping is negative autocorrelation in the pricing kernel.4 Consider an affine model with independent
factors zt1 , zt2 , ..., ztk with an innovation /jt on the j th factor, a factor loading γj on the j th factor,
and a price of risk λj on the j th factor. In such a model, the j th factor contributes
γj2 Autocov(ztj ) + γj λj Cov(ztj , /jt ),

(12)

to the autocovariance of the pricing kernel.
In our calibration, the exogenous factors in the real economy—output growth and stochastic
volatility—all have positive autocovariances and the factor innovations have positive covariances to
the factor levels. This implies that γj2 Autocov(ztj ) and Cov(ztj , /jt ) are both positive. For a factor to
contribute negatively to the autocorrelation of the pricing kernel requires that the factor loading γj
and the price of risk λj have opposite signs. Additionally, the price of risk λj must be large enough
relative to the factor loading γj to counteract the positive autocovariance term γj2 Autocov(ztj ).
Output growth has a lower autocorrelation coefficient than stochastic volatility in our calibration,
but since output growth has a much higher unconditional volatility, it has a much higher autocovariance than stochastic volatility. The factor loading γx in the real economy on the level of
output growth is equal to (1 − ρ)φx , which is nonnegative for all ρ ≤ 1. Also, the price of risk for
output growth λx is positive at the parameter values used in Figure 4 since a sufficient condition
for it to be positive is α ≤ 0 and |ρ| ≤ |α|. From (12), output growth contributes positively to the
autocovariance of the pricing kernel.

Piazzesi and Schneider (2006) argue that an upward-sloping nominal yield curve can be generated if inflation is
bad news for consumption growth. Such a structure leads to negative autocorrelation in the nominal pricing kernel.

15

From the real pricing kernel parameters given in (7), the price of risk for volatility is related to the
factor loading on the level of volatility by
λv = −

β
γv .
1 − βφv

Since 1 − βφv > 0, the volatility price of risk λv and the volatility factor loading γv have opposite
signs implying that the volatility factor can contribute a negative autocovariance to the pricing
kernel. But output growth has the strongest effect on the autocovariance of the pricing kernel,
leading to positively autocovariance in the pricing kernel. As a consequence, the average real yield
curve is downward sloping. The numerical values for the real pricing kernel’s factor loadings and
prices of risk from Figure 4 are reported in Panel A of Table 1.
In the exogenous inflation economy, shocks to inflation are uncorrelated to output growth and
stochastic volatility—the factor loadings and prices of risk on output growth and stochastic volatility
in the nominal pricing kernel are the same as in the real pricing kernel. Average nominal yields in
the exogenous inflation economy are equal to the real yields plus expected inflation and inflation
volatility with an adjustment for properties of the inflation process. The inflation shocks are
positively autocorrelated with a factor loading and a price of risk that are both positive. The average
nominal yield curve has approximately the same shape as the real yield curve—it is downward
sloping.
In the endogenous inflation economy, inflation is a linear combination of output growth, stochastic
volatility, and the monetary policy shock. From Panel A of Table 2, endogenous inflation’s loading
on output, πx , is negative. This implies that the nominal pricing kernel’s output growth factor
loading and price of risk are lower than in the exogenous inflation economy. As a consequence,
output growth contributes much less to the autocovariance of the pricing kernel with endogenous
inflation. The factor loading and price of risk for stochastic volatility are also lower in the endogenous inflation economy. The policy shocks are positively autocorrelated, but the sign of the
loading and the price of risk for the policy shock are of opposite sign. The average nominal yield
curve in the endogenous inflation economy is therefore flatter than both the real yield curve and
16

the nominal yield curve with exogenous inflation.
Turning to the volatilities in the bottom plot, the exogenous inflation economy exhibits more
volatility in short rates and less volatility in long rates than found in the data. This is a fairly
standard finding for term structure models with stationary dynamics (see Backus and Zin (1994)).
The volatility of long rates is mainly driven by the loading on the factor with the largest innovation
variance and that factor’s autocorrelation. The closer that autocorrelation is to zero, the faster
that yield volatility decreases in bond maturity. In our calibration, output growth has the largest
innovation variance and a fast rate of mean reversion, equal to 0.36. Yield volatility drops quite
quickly as bond maturity increases. In general, the lower the loading on output growth, the slower
that yield volatility drops as bond maturity increases. Because endogenous inflation is negatively
related to output growth, the factor loading on output growth is lower. Yield volatility drops at
a slower rate versus maturity in the endogenous inflation economy than in the exogenous inflation
economy.
Figure 5, Panel B of Table 1, and Panel B of Table 2 report yield curve properties with a higher
intertemporal elasticity of substitution ρ = 0, or a log time aggregator. Piazzesi and Schneider
(2006) study a model with the same preferences, but without stochastic volatility. The factor
loading on output growth in the real economy is higher than in the economy with ρ = −0.5
reported in Figure 4 (compare Panel A to Panel B of Table 1.) The average real yield curve and
the average nominal yield curve with exogenous inflation are less downward sloping when ρ = 0
than when ρ = −0.5. Similarly, increasing ρ further to 0.5 (see Figure 6) or 1.0 (see Figure 7)
leads to a less downward sloping real yield curve. Since increasing ρ decreases the factor loading
on output growth, it also decreases the volatility of real yields: see the bottom plots in Figures 4
to 7.
As ρ increases, the representative agent’s intertemporal elasticity of substitution increases implying
less demand for smoothing consumption over time. Increasing ρ decreases the representative agent’s
demand for long term bonds for the purpose of intertemporal consumption smoothing, and leads
to lower equilibrium prices and higher yields for real long term bonds. The average real yield
17

curve therefore is less downward sloping as ρ increases. Increasing ρ also reduces the sensitivity of
long-term real yields to output growth, leading to less volatile long-term yields: See the bottom
plots in Figures 4 to 7.
Nominal yields in the economies with exogenous inflation are approximately equal to the real yields
plus a maturity independent constant. But in the economies with endogenous inflation, inflation
and output growth have a negative covariance leading to a decrease in the factor loading on output
growth with endogenous inflation–see Panels C and D of Tables 1 and 2. For ρ ≥ 0.5—see Figures 6
and 7, the average nominal yield curve is upward sloping, and the shape of the volatility term
structure decays similarly to that in the data.
The final three columns of Table 2 reports unconditional moments of inflation in the economy
with endogenous inflation. There are a few notable features. First, the unconditional moments are
not particularly sensitive to the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. Second, the unconditional
variance of inflation in the calibrated economy is an order of magnitude higher than than in the
data: 0.0033 in empirical data and about 0.02 in these economies. Finally, inflation is much more
autocorrelated in the data—the AR(1) coefficient is 0.85 in the data and about 0.4 in the model
economies.
Figure 8, Figure 9, and Table 3 report results from changing the Taylor rule parameters. We keep
the remaining parameters fixed at the values used to generate Figure 7. The top plot in Figure 8
shows that increasing τx , the interest rate’s responsiveness to output growth shocks, leads to a
reduction in average nominal yields, a steepening in the average yield curve, and from the bottom
plot an increase in yield volatility.
From Panel A of Table 3, increasing τx decreases the constant in the nominal pricing kernel,
decreases the factor loading, decreases the price of risk for output growth, and also increases the
factor loading for stochastic volatility. The loading on output growth in the pricing kernel drops
because the sensitivity of the inflation rate to output growth drops, and the sensitivity of inflation
to the to stochastic volatility increases by a large amount—from 6.66 to 8.55.

18

The top plot in Figure 9 shows that increasing τp , the interest rate responsiveness to inflation,
leads to a reduction in average nominal yields, a flattening in the average yield curve, and from the
bottom plot a decrease in yield volatility.
From Panel B of Table 3, increasing τp decreases the constant in the nominal pricing kernel,
increases the factor loading on output growth, increases the price of risk for output growth, decreases
the factor loading for stochastic volatility, and also drops the factor loading on the monetary
policy shock. The constant in the pricing kernel drops because the constant in the inflation rate
drops, the factor loading on output growth increases because the sensitivity of the inflation rate to
output growth increases, and the sensitivity of inflation to stochastic volatility decreases by a large
amount—from 6.66 to 3.58.
Overall, the experiments reported in Figure 8 and Figure 9 show that properties of the term
structure depend on the form of the monetary authorities interest rate feedback rule. In particular,
the factor loading on stochastic volatility is quite sensitive to the interest rate rule. Since stochastic
volatility is driving time-variation in interest rate risk-premiums in this economy, monetary policy
can have large impacts on interest rate risk premiums in this economy.

Related Research

The model we develop is similar to a version of Bansal and Yaron (2004) that includes stochastic
volatility; however, our simple autoregressive state-variable process does not capture their richer
ARMA specification. Our work is also related to Piazzesi and Schneider (2006) who emphasize that
for a structural model to generate an upward-sloping nominal yield curve requires joint assumptions
on preferences and the distribution of fundamentals. Our work highlights how an upward-sloping
yield curve can also be generated through the monetary authority’s interest rate feedback rule.
Our paper adds to a large and growing literature combining structural macroeconomic models
that include Taylor rules with arbitrage-free term structures models. Ang and Piazzesi (2003),
19

following work by Piazzesi (2005), have shown that a factor model of the term structure that
imposes no-arbitrage conditions can provide a better empirical model of the term structure than a
model based on unobserved factors or latent variables alone. Estrella and Mishkin (1997), Evans
and Marshall (1998), Evans and Marshall (2001), Hördahl et al. (2003), Bekaert et al. (2005), and
Ravenna and Seppala (2006) also provide evidence of the benefits of building arbitrage-free termstructure models with macroeconomic fundamentals. Rudebusch and Wu (2004) and Ang et al.
(2004) investigate the empirical consequences of imposing a Taylor Rule on the performance of
arbitrage-free term-structure models.
For an alternative linkage between short-maturity and long-maturity bond yields, see Vayanos and
Vila (2006) who show how the shape of the term structure is determined in the presence of riskaverse arbitrageurs, investor clienteles for specific bond maturities, and an exogenous short rate
which could be driven by the central bank’s monetary policy.

Conclusions

We demonstrate that an endogenous monetary policy that involves an interest-rate feedback rule
can contribute to the riskiness of multi-period bonds by creating an endogenous inflation process
that exhibits significant covariance risk with the pricing kernel. We explore this through a recursive
utility model with stochastic volatility which generates sizable average risk premiums. Our results
point to a number of additional questions. First, the Taylor rule that we work with is arbitrary. How
would the predictions of the model change with alternative specification of the rule? In particular,
how would adding monetary non-neutralities along the lines of a New Keynesian Phillips curve as
in Clarida et al. (2000) and Gallmeyer et al. (2005) alter the monetary-policy consistent pricing
kernel? Second, what Taylor rule would implement an optimal monetary policy in this context?
Since preferences have changed relative to the models in the literature, this is a nontrivial theoretical
question.
In addition, the simple calibration exercise in this paper is not a very good substitute for a more
20

serious econometric exercise. Further research will explore the tradeoffs between shock specifications, preference parameters, and monetary policy rules for empirical yield curve models that closer
match historical evidence.
Finally, it would be instructive to compare and contrast the recursive utility model with stochastic
volatility to other preference specifications that are capable of generating realistic risk premiums.
The leading candidate on this dimension is the external habits models of Campbell and Cochrane
(1999). We are currently pursuing an extension of the external habits model in Gallmeyer et al.
(2005) to include an endogenous, Taylor-rule driven inflation process.

The table reports the affine term structure parameters for the real term structure, the nominal
term structure in the exogenous inflation economy, and the nominal term structure in the economy
with endogenous inflation. The parameters in each panel are computed using a different set of
preference parameters. We fix a level of the intertemporal elasticity parameter ρ and choose the
remaining preference parameters—the risk aversion coefficient α and the rate of time preference
β to minimize the distance between the average nominal yields and yield volatilities in the data
and the those implied by the economy with an exogenous inflation rate. We pick the Taylor-rule
parameters to minimize the distance between the average nominal yields and yield volatilities in
the data and the those implied by the economy with an endogenous inflation rate.
