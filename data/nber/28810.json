    "abstract": "\n\nTheories of household saving, including the life cycle hypothesis, posit that households add or draw down wealth to equalize the value of consumption over time. This article examines the extent to which late\u2013nineteenth\u2013century, small\u2013town Americans accumulated financial assets consistent with the life cycle hypothesis. Using individual account records from a small\u2013town savings banks, I find that savers accumulated an average of one year\u2019s income at age sixty. Decumulation was slower than expected after age sixty. The evidence is inconsistent with a strong bequest motive, so the slow drawing down of wealth in old age may have been due to uncertain mortality risk or wealth\u2013based attrition from the sample. I find differences in the life cycle accumulations between men and women, the native\u2013 and foreign\u2013born, and low\u2013skill and high\u2013skill workers.\n\n",
