This short note begins by summarizing the general case against using fiscal policy for stabilization.  It next considers the argument for using a  hyperexpansive' monetary policy to reduce the risk that a low rate of inflation will lead to a deflationary situation in which monetary policy becomes ineffective.  Such a policy would increase the risk of asset price bubbles and of a misaligned exchange rate. Discretionary fiscal policy provides an alternative way to stimulate the economy when aggregate demand and interest rates are low and when prices are falling or may soon be falling.  A stimulus can be achieved without increasing budget deficits if the fiscal policy acts by providing an incentive for increased private spending.  Specific examples for the U.S. and Japan are considered.\n\n",
