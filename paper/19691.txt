ABSTRACT
Most listed firms are freestanding in the U.S, while listed firms in other countries often belong to business
groups: lasting structures in which listed firms control other listed firms. Hand-collected historical
data illuminate how the present ownership structure of the United States arose: (1) Until the mid-20th
century, US corporate ownership was unexceptional: large pyramidal groups dominated many industries;
(2) About half of these resembled groups elsewhere today in being industrially diversified and family
controlled; but the others were tightly focused and had widely held apex firms; (3) US business groups
disappeared gradually, primarily in the 1940s, and by 1950 were largely gone; Their demise took place
against growing concerns that they posed a threat to competition and even to society; (4) The data
link the disappearance of business groups to reforms that targeted them explicitly – the Public Utility
Holding Company Act (1935) and rising intercorporate dividend taxation (after 1935), or indirectly
– enhanced investor protection (after 1934), the Investment Company Act (1940) and escalating estate
taxes. Banking reforms and rejuvenated antitrust enforcement may have indirectly contributed too.
These reforms, sustained in a lasting anti-big business climate, promoted the dissolution of existing
groups and discouraged the formation of new ones. Thus, a multi-pronged reform agenda, sustained
by a supportive political climate, created an economy of freestanding firms.

1. Introduction
Large listed firms in the United States today are exceptional in the sense that virtually all are
freestanding: that is, they neither control nor are controlled by another listed firm (La Porta et al.,
1999; Villalonga and Amit, 2009; Masulis et al., 2011). Elsewhere, large listed firms often belong to
pyramidal business groups, structures in which an apex firm, usually controlled by a wealthy family,
holds equity control blocks in one or more listed firms, each of which then holds equity control blocks
in one or more other listed firms, and so on. Such structures let business families outside the United
States magnify their fortunes into control over corporate assets worth vastly more, effectively
entrusting the corporate governance of large swaths of a national economy to a handful of business
families. In the United States, even the most prominent tycoon rarely controls more than one listed
firm. Elsewhere, control over corporate empires passes from father to son (seldom to daughter), while
only a few large listed US firms are heir-run. These differences give US capitalism a less oligarchic
flavor than elsewhere.
Using hand-collected data, we show that these exceptional characteristics of the US economy
are historically recent. In the 1930s and 1940s, the US corporate landscape resembled that in other
countries today, with over 50 large pyramidal business groups operating firms in manufacturing,
railroads, and public utilities.1 Group affiliates included about half of the largest US manufacturing
firms, and several powerful financial institutions. As fractions of GDP, the sales of US business groups
at the time easily eclipse those of the largest US corporations today. These groups began downsizing
and disappearing, some in the late 1930s and many more in the 1940s, so that by the middle of the
twentieth century, the US corporate landscape took its current shape. 2
US pyramidal groups of the 1930s and 1940s differed from those in other countries today in
several ways. First, although some US groups were widely diversified, many were highly focused,
with all or most of their member firms in a single industry, notably public utilities or railroads. Second,
though many US groups were controlled by business families, about half were controlled by widely
held apex firms. Third, the intercorporate equity stakes in American pyramids were large, especially
after 1940. These patterns contrast with pyramids elsewhere in the world today, which typically have
member firms in many (sometimes virtually all) industries, controlling shareholders (usually wealthy

1

Berle and Means (1932) are often cited for documenting the widely held nature of US corporations and for highlighting
the governance problems of such firms. In fact, they discuss pyramidal business groups at length and argue that their
governance problems can be worse. In our data set, only about one fifth of the groups were in public utilities. Studies
focusing solely on this sector (e.g., Bank and Cheffins, 2010; Mahoney, 2012; Perez-Gonzales, 2014) therefore miss many
business groups.
2
Another unusual feature of the US corporate ownership which is not discussed in the present study is that most large US
firms are widely held, whereas large firms elsewhere typically have controlling shareholders, usually wealthy families (La
Porta et al., 1999; Becht and DeLong, 2005).

families), and low intercorporate control blocks (20% is often enough to wield effective control
because small shareholders seldom vote).3
Pyramidal groups in the United States were large, complex, and numerous in the mid-1930s,
and then slowly eroded away. By 1950, only a few small pyramids remained. The demise of US
business groups occurred later and more slowly than previously posited (Morck, 2005a; Morck and
Yeung, 2005; Bank and Cheffins, 2010), with the most precipitous drop after 1940. Groups with
family controlled apex firms nearly disappeared by 1950, whereas some groups with widely held apex
firms, including important pyramids such as those controlled by AT&T and the Pennsylvania Railroad,
persisted.
The demise of business groups in the United States took place against the backdrop of a
political climate in which President Roosevelt regarded the concentration of economic power through
holding companies and business groups as a serious menace to competition and to American society
more generally. 4 We argue that several policy measures introduced during his presidency contributed
jointly to the disappearance of the business group structure from the US economic landscape:
Consistent with Bank and Cheffins (2010) and Mahoney (2012), we find direct and explicit evidence
that the roughly one in five pyramidal groups whose member firms were predominantly public utilities
began to downsize and disappear, especially after 1940, when US courts started enforcing the Public
Utilities Holding Companies Act (PUHCA) of 1935, long stalled by court challenges. As a result of
this Act, the small number of pyramids in public utilities (e.g., electric power, natural gas, sewer and
water companies) surviving to 1950 were reduced to two tiers. The PUHCA, however, had no effect
on the majority of pyramids which operated in other sectors.
Pyramidal business groups with no significant presence in public utilities began to shrink after
1937 and especially in the 1940s. Several major reforms are implicated:
First, tax reforms starting in 1935 levied double taxation on intercorporate dividends, initially
at low rates and then at much higher rates. Because these taxes applied each time dividend income
passed from subsidiary to parent, the effective rate compounds the statutory rate by the number of tiers
in the pyramid and may become prohibitive for multi-tiered pyramidal groups. Consistent with the tax
having an effect on groups, we observe a significant flattening of pyramids after the tax came into
force. The tax was avoidable if the parent’s equity holding in the subsidiary exceeded 85%;
accordingly, intercorporate stakes increased significantly in the 1940s, often, though not always, to
levels above 85%. These high intercorporate equity stakes limit both the separation of ownership from
control rights available to the pyramid’s ultimate controlling owners and the usefulness of pyramiding
3

Pyramidal business groups with widely-held apex companies are rare but not unknown outside the United States –
examples include the BCE and Canadian Pacific groups in mid-twentieth century Canada (Morck, Stangeland and Yeung,
2000), the Handelsbanken group in Sweden (Hogfeldt, 2005), and the Nissan zaibatsu in prewar Japan (Morck and
Nakamura, 2005).
4
See, for example, President Roosevelt’s 1938 speech published in the American Economic Review in 1942.

as a way to lever a merely respectable fortune into control over a much larger business empire. Also
consistent with groups restructuring to avoid double taxation, intercorporate dividend, as a fraction of
all dividends, peaked in the mid-1930s and then declined markedly.
The next two regulatory reforms may have affected groups, although precise measurement of
their effect is not possible and the evidence we present is somewhat speculative. The Securities Act of
1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 substantially enhanced shareholder rights,
rendering corporations more transparent and proscribing several common “tunneling” practices of the
1920s. Plausibly, these changes diminished insiders’ private benefits of control. The finding that
pyramidal groups with tycoons or families as controlling shareholders disappeared faster than those
with widely held apex firms is consistent with this conjecture: to the extent that private benefits of
control might have been a more important purpose for the former groups, when securities law reforms
interfered with that purpose, they faded away. The general decline in the size and complexity of
business groups during the 1940s may also be partly attributed to enhanced public shareholder legal
rights protected by the SEC.
The Investment Company Act (ICA) of 1940 affected holding companies, except in public
utilities or railroads, by subjecting them to regulation as closed-end mutual funds unless their
ownership stakes in the firms they controlled exceeded 50%. Being so classified imposed major
constraints on the controlling shareholders and insiders of the holding company, including severe
limitations of their involvement in decision making in the firms whose shares the holding company
held and on non-arm’s-length transactions. The Act also restricted holding companies designated as
investment funds from levering up and imposed burdensome disclosure requirements. While no groups
in our sample were included in the lists of investment funds directly regulated by the ICA or involved
in ICA-based legal challenges, after 1940, most intercorporate control blocks exceeded the 50-percent
threshold needed for exemption from this Act. While this could have had other reasons, the ICA might
have been responsible.
We also discuss two other legislative and regulatory measures that might plausibly have
affected pyramidal groups, estate taxes and antitrust enforcement. We find no evidence that these
regulations played a direct role in the demise of groups; family controlled groups commonly used
mechanisms to avoid the estate tax, and antitrust enforcement was insufficient to curb the influence of
business groups, in line with President Roosevelt’s 1938 speech (published a few years later, see,
Roosevelt, 1942). However, all the regulatory measures discussed here, together with other New Deal
regulations such as the Glass Steagall (Banking) Act of 1933, may well have combined to create a
business environment hostile to large pyramidal groups, and thus help explain corporate ownership in
the United States today. The general public policy lesson from the historical period we study may be
that only a sustained multi-pronged regulatory effort, combined with the right political climate, can
create an economy of freestanding and generally widely held businesses.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section presents the historical and
institutional background for this study and surveys the related literature, both historical and more
recent. Section 3 describes the newly constructed data set used for this study. Section 4 presents what
we believe to be the first systematic statistical evidence on the existence and characteristics of business
groups in the United States. Section 5 focuses on the demise of business groups after 1937 and
examines empirically several possible reasons for it. Section 6 concludes and presents an agenda for
future research.
2. Literature Review and Historical Background
Pyramidal Business Groups
Pyramidal business groups5 are prominent features of the economic landscapes of most countries, both
developing and developed, but are all but absent in the US.6 In a business group, an apex firm holds
enough equity in each of a first tier of listed subsidiaries to appoint its board. A majority stake
guarantees this, but a much smaller stake generally suffices if most small shareholders do not vote
their shares. Each of these firms likewise has publicly-listed subsidiaries, which in turn have their own
subsidiaries. The ultimate controlling shareholder, in charge of the apex firm, is usually a family. Such
pyramidal business groups can be vast: South Korea is home to the world’s largest pyramidal group,
Samsung, which accounts for about one seventh of Korea’s GDP. The largest group in Canada in the
1990s, the Hees-Edper group, capped with a family trust structure controlled by a branch of the
Bronfman family, contained over 500 corporations organized into 16 tiers. The largest pyramidal
group in Sweden, capped by Investors, a closed-end fund controlled by the Wallenberg family,
contains firms that collectively constitute about a third of Swedish total market capitalization in a
typical year. A pyramidal group controlled by the tycoon Slim Helu similarly dominates Mexican
equity markets.
Large pyramidal business groups, letting a modestly wealthy tycoon or family lever its wealth
into control over a corporate empire worth vastly more, have several key economic implications. On
the positive side, large business groups may well form naturally in economies with weak market
institutions (Khanna and Yafeh, 2007), where member firms can provide all or most key inputs to each
other and avoid costly arm’s-length transactions in product markets rife with corruption, monopoly

Pyramidal business groups are sometimes referred to, especially in US publications, as conglomerates. This is misleading.
In US stock markets, conglomerates are single listed firms, or firms with unlisted subsidiaries only, that are diversified –
they operate in multiple industries (Servaes, 1996). Business groups are clusters of listed corporations under common
control. Business groups may or may not be diversified, but their member firms seldom are. With one exception
(International Telephone & Telegraph, ITT) there is no overlap or relation between the business groups we study here,
dating back to the 1930s and 1940s, and the diversified US conglomerates of the 1960s listed in Dirlam (1970).

Morck, Wolfenzon and Yeung (2005), Khanna and Yafeh (2007), and Morck (2010) provide literature reviews. Pyramidal
groups in the histories of specific countries are described in the chapters of Barca and Becht (2001), Morck (2005b), and
Coplan et al. (2010).

pricing, and quality verification problems. Business group firms can also invest in each other, fund
new startups as other group firms come to need new inputs, and coinsure each other – effectively
forming an internal capital market and avoiding the broader economy’s corrupt or dysfunctional
capital market and institutions. Funding new startups also naturally extends a group’s pyramidal
structure, as cash-rich member firms readily fund start-ups as subsidiaries in the tiers beneath them.
Groups can share new technologies and orchestrate cross-firm collaboration on research without risk
of losing intellectual property. Employees and managers can also move from group firm to group firm,
in an internal labor market free of the quality verification problems that can undermine economy-level
labor markets in developing countries. Outside shareholders may even prefer to invest in group
member firms, whose ultimate controlling shareholders attain reputations for fair dealing. Employees
and independent suppliers and buyers may similarly prefer dealing with group firms controlled by such
persons.
But large groups can also have serious downsides. They can come to wield market power and
impede competition, a key concern of President Roosevelt’s in 1930s America. In addition, the family
controlling the apex firm has a diminishing financial interest in firms in successively lower tiers of the
pyramid, in which it wields complete control with only partial, possibly very little, real ownership.
This separation of ownership from control, which Berle and Means (1932) warn of in pyramids as
much as in widely held firms, creates scope for a range of corporate governance problems that can
compromise economy-level capital allocation and impede economic development (Morck, Wolfenzon
and Yeung, 2005; Khanna and Yafeh, 2007).
As economies develop, the advantages of pyramidal business groups fade relative to
increasingly efficient market transactions. At a sufficient developmental level, an economy of
pyramidal business groups becomes disadvantaged relative an economy of freestanding competitive
firms engaging in market transactions; and its pyramids would break up under competitive pressure.
This logic suggests that old pyramidal business groups ought to fade away, and that new ones ought
not to form in sufficiently developed economies. However, the concentration of economic power
associated with controlling a large pyramidal business group bestows formidable lobbying power on
their controlling shareholders. If further economic development threatens their economic, political, and
social dominance, business groups’ controlling shareholders might lobby to slow or even stall
development, leaving their economy in a “middle income trap” (Morck, Wolfenzon and Yeung, 2005).
Thus, leading reformers in many countries, including Israel, Italy and Korea, contemplate legislative or
regulatory measures to constrain or even dismantle pyramidal groups.7

American Exceptionalism regarding Business Groups
Pyramidal groups are now so rare in the United States that they were all but forgotten by generations
of US economists, and only reemerged as the field sought to make sense of other economies. Figure 1,
based on recent data from Masulis et al. (2011), shows far smaller fractions of firms belonging to
family controlled business groups in in the United States than elsewhere. Indeed, Villalonga and Amit
(2009), searching through US data using a generous definition of a pyramidal business group, identify
only a handful of very small marginal structures.8
Only the United Kingdom and Japan have a similar dearth of family business groups. Franks et
al. (2005) highlight the London Stock Exchange’s 1968 Takeover Rule, which mandates that any bid
for 30% or more of a firm’s shares be for 100%. Pyramids can generally be held together with small
control blocks, often far less than 50%, because few small shareholders vote their shares (La Porta et
al., 1999). Takeover bids for such a firm quickly force either the raider or defending block holder to
pass the 30% threshold, so listed UK firms are generally either widely held or unlisted, making
pyramidal groups unstable.9 The United States has no equivalent Takeover Rule. In theory, US M&A
bids can be for any stake; however, essentially all are for full ownership.
Most large Japanese firms belonged to family controlled pyramidal business groups prior to
World War II. Japan’s post-war US military government (1945–1952), tying these families to the
wartime regime, dissolved the pyramids, dispersing shares of affiliated companies to managers,
employees and others, leaving most large listed firms widely held until the early 1950s (Yafeh, 1995;
Franks et al., 2014). Two postwar episodes of hostile takeovers led several groups of large Japanese
firms to participate in the formation of keiretsu – a new form of business group – arguably designed as
a takeover defense (Sheard, 1991; Morck and Nakamura, 2005). Each keiretsu member firm created
treasury shares amounting to a majority of its shares, and distributed these to other member firms in
return for their shares. This left each firm without any single controlling shareholder, but majority
owned by all the other firms in the keiretsu and thus protected from raiders. This shows up as
dispersed ownership in international comparisons. 10 The United States has no keiretsu.
8

Examples include Thermo-Electron, a now defunct Boston venture capital firm that retained control blocks after taking its
ventures to the IPO stage and Cox Communications, a now-disbanded family-run pyramid with three small listed firms.
Kaiser Industries, a listed firm, controlled three listed manufacturing firms until it was dissolved in 1977 (Gilson and Black,
2007). The Tisch brothers’ Loew Corporation controlled a block in CBS, a television network, for several years in the early
1990s. A developing exception may be Warren Buffet, controlling shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway, which, until
recently, took its acquisition targets private. However, the firm has recently taken to acquiring substantial minority blocks
in target firms as an activist investor. Aside from these exceptions, notable for their rarity, intercorporate equity stakes in
US listed firms tend to be either takeovers or divestitures underway.
9
Corporate ownership in the United Kingdom was dispersed even very early in the twentieth century (Franks et al., 2009)
suggesting that other forces also contributed to dispersed ownership, if not to destabilizing pyramids. Similar takeover rules
in other countries without intense merger activity appear ineffective in deterring pyramids.
10
Figure 1 also shows Australia, Canada and the Netherlands with a low incidence of pyramidal groups, though not as low
as the US. Craswell et al. (1997) confirm that most large Australian firms are widely held. Morck, Tian, Percy and Yeung
(2005) show pyramids rising and falling repeatedly in Canada, most recently in the 1980s and 1990s. They relate these
changes to economic crises, changes in estate taxes, and the varying scope of state interventionism. The Netherlands has a

Historical Background
Histories of America’s rapid industrialization era, roughly between 1870 and 1904, reveal large
business groups to be important (Chernow, 1990; DeLong, 1991). In the decades after its Civil War,
America’s industrialization was led by business groups organized under voting trusts, an 1879
financial innovation of J.D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Co., subsequently employed by J.P. Morgan to
finance mergers, especially in a merger wave around the turn of the twentieth century. Target firms’
shareholders exchanged their shares for units in a voting trust, which fully owned the targets.11 These
units were non-voting – their voting rights were “entrusted” to the Morgan Bank or Morgan-backed
entrepreneurs, such as Rockefeller or Thomas Edison. One voting trust could control any number of
operating companies. The Morgan Bank’s central role in organizing and running many trusts put it at
the center of a large, highly diversified business group (Moody, 1904), with central coordination
effected by Morgan partners sitting on member firms’ boards (DeLong, 1991).
Concern that trusts coordinated monopolies led to anti-monopoly legislation, the Sherman
Antitrust Act of 1890. American courts had long ruled that corporations had no business owning shares
in other corporations, so the rare pyramidal structures that existed required state charters. In 1888,
apparently anticipating the Sherman Act’s focus on trusts, New Jersey’s legislature legalized holding
companies, corporations whose assets include shares in other corporations (Freedland, 1955; Nelson,
1959; Grandy, 1989). The New Jersey reform, soon emulated by Delaware, offered trusts possible
reprieve from the Sherman Act if they reorganized as pyramids (Keller, 1979).12
Harried by antitrust lawsuits, Standard Oil Trust reorganized itself under a holding company in
1899, and other large trusts soon followed. Among the holding companies created during this period
were the Consolidated Tobacco Company, Eastman Kodak, US Steel (all in 1901), followed by and
DuPont (1903) and General Motors (1908) (Bonbright and Means, 1932; Nelson, 1959). Between 1895
and 1904, 167 holding groups consolidated more than 1800 companies and controlled more than 40
percent of the capital invested in the industrial sector (Hogan, 1971; Keller, 1979).
Despite occasional court disputes, several regulatory changes let holding companies expand
ever larger pyramidal business groups through the 1920s.13 The Revenue Act of 1918 granted an

mandatory takeover rule and various control enhancement mechanisms, such as golden shares, that can lock in managerial
control without large block holders (De Jong and Roell, 2005).
11
Target shareholders were often eager to do this, especially if the target neared bankruptcy, because their liability, while
limited, could exceed what they “paid in” to buy their shares. Actual trusts could be far more complicated, but all turned on
exchanging voting shares for non-voting units in a voting trust (Chernow, 1990; DeLong, 1991).
12
The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (est. 1832), the first US holding company, was perceived as a legal anomaly: “At
common law, in New York and virtually every other American jurisdiction, it has been uniformly held that a business
corporation has no inherent authority to hold the stock of another business corporation, even if both corporations are
engaged in exactly the same type of business venture” (Freedland, 1955, p. 369).
13
The definition of a business group used in this study requires having at least three publicly-traded companies under
common control (see below). As some holding companies controlled private subsidiaries only, the existence of a holding
company did not necessarily imply the formation of a business group. For example, real estate companies in the United

explicit tax exemption to intercorporate dividends. States, vying to attract head offices, raced to
facilitate holding companies (Nelson, 1959). Successive Coolidge administrations defunded anti-trust
enforcement (Bittlingmayer, 2001) which, in any case, was widely thought inapplicable to holding
companies (Bonbright and Means, 1932).14
Large pyramidal business groups formed rapidly in the 1920s, accruing multiple tiers of fully
and partially owned, listed and unlisted, member firms – some pure holding companies, some partial
holding companies, and others pure operating companies (Allen, 1935). Pyramids expanded by
founding or acquiring new subsidiaries as well as growing established ones. Soon, large pyramidal
groups towered over railroads, manufacturing, and public utilities.
The most comprehensive contemporary source on US pyramids and business groups in the
1930s is Bonbright and Means (1932), who list many 1930s groups variously containing public
utilities firms, railroads, manufacturing firms, and financial firms. Many of these groups focused on a
single sector – especially public utilities or railroads. Major investment banks orchestrated the
formation of many groups (Kotz, 1978; Markham, 1955), and some retained ongoing control. Wealthy
business families ended up in control of many others.15
Pyramidal groups came to dominate public utilities more than any other sector, so public
utilities pyramids attracted disproportionate attention. This is understandable given the times.
Electrification was the internet of the 1920s (Jovanovic and Rouseau, 2003), and local entrepreneurs
organized companies to electrify cities and regions all over the United States, often selling out to
business groups. By 1926, business group firms generated almost 75% of all electricity (Pinchot,
1928). By 1930, 19 business groups controlled 90% of all electricity generating operating companies
(Energy Information Administration, 1993). Other utilities sectors were likewise dominated by
business groups. Electric power poles could double as telephone poles, and local phone companies
formed throughout the country, their networks soon melded together under AT&T, which controlled
approximately 97% of all telephone business by the late 1920s. Four pyramidal groups dominated
consumer natural gas provision.
Pyramidal business groups in public utilities contributed critical financial and managerial
expertise to small, local operating units they acquired (Ruggles, 1929; Annual Report of the Fair Trade
Commission, FTC, 1927). Pyramidal groups were also thought to allocate capital and equipment more
efficiently, cut distribution costs, professionalize management, gain better terms from suppliers,
States today commonly separately incorporate each of their properties and projects, despite owning 100% of them all. We
do not consider these business groups because the controlled corporations are fully owned and unlisted.
14
Section 7 of the Clayton Act was thought inapplicable to holding companies controlling operating firms not in direct
competition with each other (Bonbright and Means, 1932).
15
Lundberg (1937) describes commonplace inter-marriages between families controlling business groups, not unlike those
Bunkanwanicha et al. (2013) describe between present-day Thai families controlling business groups. The National
Resources Committee (NRC) describes in The Structure of the American Economy (published in 1939) extensive director
interlocks in the United States of the 1930s, not unlike those Khanna and Thomas (2009) document in present-day Chile.

coordinate joint engineering, construction and R&D expenditures, and reduce their member firms’
costs of capital by dint of their geographical diversification and mutual coinsurance (Waltersdorf,
1926). These views contrast sharply with turn-of-the-century concerns about holding companies
abusing market power (Markham, 1955; Nelson, 1959).
By the late 1920s and 1930s, such sentiments were giving way to skepticism. Many pyramidal
groups seemed overcapitalized (Anderson, 1947), prone to monopolistic pricing, or even tainted by
political corruption (Waltersdorf, 1926; Buchanan, 1937). Many, seemingly using accounting
loopholes to inflate asset valuations, began looking perilously leveraged (Graham and Dodd, 1934).16
Public utilities could largely escape state regulation by becoming a subsidiary of out-of-state holding
companies.17 Finally, public utilities were local monopolies, so consumers could not take their
business elsewhere if prices seemed too high or service too poor.
The 1930s literature on business groups in the United States is remarkably predictive of current
work. Buchanan (1936) regards business groups as mechanisms for letting member firms coinsure
each other and manage risk, presaging arguments by Khanna and Yafeh (2005). Anticipating Morck,
Wolfenzon and Yeung (2005), Anderson (1947), argues that, in their early stages of development, US
groups solved problems of under-developed capital markets, but later turned to price fixing, related
party transactions and violations of investor rights. Bonbright and Means (1932) auger yet more
arguments in the modern literature (e.g., Khanna and Palepu, 2000): groups were established to take
advantage of scarce managerial skills and to create internal capital markets for group-affiliated firms,
which otherwise faced difficulties raising capital. Bonbright and Means (1932) foreshadow also
concerns about “tunneling’ (Johnson et al., 2000) in positing that groups’ controlling shareholders’
orchestrate intra-group transactions to divert dividends away from other shareholders. One 1930s
concern that current work omits is groups benefiting from the “cost plus” regulation of public utilities,
in which regulatory boards set consumer prices to give the firm revenues equal to its costs plus a
regulated profit rate. This invites intra-group transactions to transfer costs from unregulated to
regulated member firms.
US regulators began to move after a series of influential reports. A 1927 FTC report criticized
General Electric for monopolistic pricing. A 1928 report condemned monopoly power in the electricity
and gas industries. Also in 1928, the National Association of Railroad and Utility Commissioners

Contemporary observers viewed the limited regulation of holding companies in the public utility sector as worrisome
(Buchanan, 1937). Even though the public utility sector was heavily regulated at both the State and the Federal levels, the
holding companies themselves were left almost unnoticed with no Federal law providing for their direct supervision except
the Federal Power Act of 1920. At the State level, in the vast majority of cases, public utility commissioners had no
jurisdiction over holding companies, although indirect influence through the regulation of retail prices and of transactions
with operating companies within State boundaries was possible. See also President Roosevelt’s 1935 address
(http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15019) and Energy Information Administration (1993).

argued that State Commissioners be given explicit powers to regulate holding companies (Greenlaw,
1930; Morehouse, 1929).
With the end of the laissez-faire Coolidge administration and the onset of the Great
Depression, ideas about breaking the “money trusts” gained further support. Anti-big business
sentiment was fuelled by the collapse of the highly leveraged Insull Group, the third largest utility
group, in 1931 (Cudahy and Henderson, 2005; Banks and Cheffins, 2010; Mahoney, 2012). Because
the group’s firms had been coinsuring each other (McDonald, 2004), they ultimately failed together,
generating spectacular headlines. In the subsequent six years, many more utilities holding companies
and affiliates went bankrupt (Melnyk and Lamb, 2006), often following what was perceived as overexpansion and unrelated diversification (Buchanan, 1936 and 1937; Dewing 1941; SEC 1944 Annual
report).18 These events led to a sequence of dramatic regulatory measures.
In 1932 the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) submitted to Congress a special report
recommending the prohibition of control acquisitions over two or more railroad carriers by a single
holding corporation (except with the ICC’s approval), and the application of ICC regulation to the
issuance of securities by railroad holding companies (Ansnes, 1932).19 In 1933 the Emergency
Railroad Transportation Act was enacted, broadening the ICC’s jurisdiction over holding companies,
subjecting all consolidations, leases and acquisitions of controlling shares or control arrangements by a
holding company to the ICC’s approval (Conant, 1961; Goddard, 1933).20
Elected at the nadir of the Great Depression, amid widespread dismay that capitalism,
liberalism, and even democracy had failed, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt promised Americans
a “New Deal.” His administration, blocked by the Supreme Court from implementing the corporatist
reforms other Western countries were embracing, had no choice but to chart its own course. The result
was a multidimensional array of reforms, several among these explicitly targeting pyramidal groups.
After describing our data and evidence about the importance of pyramidal business groups in the
period from the 1920s through to 1950, we explain each major reform in detail and our evidence about
its actual importance in reshaping the US economic landscape.
3. Historical Sources and the Construction of the Data Set
Our dataset is an unbalanced panel of 15,270 firm-years (2,743 firms) drawn at six points in time:
1926, 1929, 1932, 1937, 1940 and 1950. The main data sources are Moody’s Manuals – that is,
relevant annual issues of Moody’s Industrial Manual, Moody’s Railroad Manual, and Moody’s Public
18

Galbraith (1954) describes the failure of the holding companies differently, focusing on what he calls “reverse leverage”
where intercorporate dividends were used to pay interest on bonds issued by companies at the apex of pyramids. In his
view, the downturn of the late 1920s created a liquidity problem and reduced the capacity of daughter companies to pay
dividends, resulting in bankruptcies of many parent holding companies.

Utilities Manual. These provide general information about each firm, its ownership structure, a brief
description of its history, a limited set of financial variables and some information about its capital
structure and management.21
We start with the ownership structure of the 200 largest US non-financial corporations ranked
by total assets, as reported in Berle and Means (1932). This list includes firms in all sectors except
finance. Using Moody’s Manuals, we track the chain of companies controlled by these 200 “B&M
list” corporations and construct 200 detailed ownership trees including parent corporations and
successive tiers of controlled subsidiaries. We then follow the same companies over time, backward
and forward, in snapshots, the earliest in 1926 and the latest in 1950, constructing similar ownership
trees for each year.22 All companies that were directly or indirectly controlled by a corporation on the
B&M list at any time during this 25-year period are included in the sample.23 We expand these
ownership trees by tracking parent corporations, parent’s parent corporations and so on, until we
identify the ultimate owners of every corporation.24 We define owners as “ultimate” if they themselves
are not controlled by another entity: the ultimate controlling company may be widely held or
controlled by individuals and families, either directly or via trusts and other control devices. Having
identified the ultimate owners, we assign every identified firm to a control cluster (a set of firms
controlled by a common ultimate owner), or classify it as freestanding. The resulting control clusters
are treated as follows: as in Mahoney (2012), a subsidiary of which 95% or more of the shares are
controlled by a parent is defined as a fully-owned subsidiary, whereas an affiliated company where the
controller’s equity stake is smaller than 95% is regarded as public (otherwise, it is considered

21

Moody’s Manuals, scanned and uploaded onto an online database, are available upon subscription from Mergent Online
(http://webreports.mergent.com/). The years we refer to are the manuals’ year of publication, which typically contain data
for the previous year.
22
To test for the possibility of sample selection we conduct the following tests: first, following Lundberg (1937), Collins
and Preston (1961) and Navin (1970), we confirm that our sample is representative of the overall US corporate population:
the combined assets of firms included in our data set amount to over half of all non-banking corporate assets in America at
the time. Berle and Means (1932) report that, during their period of study, the remaining corporate assets were held by
more than 300,000 small and widely-held companies. Second, we verify, using lists of the largest US firms between the
1940s and 1960s (Lundberg, 1968) that no newly-formed large companies and controlled subsidiaries are omitted from the
sample. Finally, to control for the possibility of selection in the ownership data as reported in Moody’s manuals, we pick at
random nine companies from the three different manuals (railroads, public utilities and industrial firms) and compare the
list of controlled subsidiaries in their consolidated reports with the subsidiaries reported in Moody’s manuals. 291
companies exist in both data sources, but 144 are not in our (Moody’s manuals-based) dataset. Most of these are small (in
terms of total assets), 100% controlled subsidiaries.
23
We are not always able to identify the reason why a firm may not appear in the sample in a certain year. In most cases,
we rely on Moody’s manuals, and conclude that the “missing” company was either dissolved or merged into another
company, or that it was simply not yet established. In other cases, Moody chose not to include the firm’s reports in the
manual because of “lack of public interest.” Finally, especially in the case of small subsidiaries entirely owned by larger
firms, Moody often chose not to provide a separate report for them. Instead, a brief paragraph is included in the controlling
company’s report, describing the main facts about smaller controlled subsidiaries. Nevertheless, there are still cases where
we cannot establish the fate of a company.
24
Data sources include: Moody’s Annual Reports, the website fundinguniverse.com, historical texts from archive.org,
historical company records, SEC Annual Reports starting 1935, the archives of the Wall Street Journal and the New York
Times, and the final report of the Temporary National Economic Committee on the Concentration of Economic Power
(TNEC).

private).25 We combine this information with Moody’s description of whether the company is traded
on a stock exchange and also use the SEC Annual Reports published starting December 1935 and the
CRSP database for the period 1930-1950 to verify our definitions. Using this classification of
companies into public and private, we define a “business group” as a cluster with three or more public
companies controlled by the same ultimate owner. Control clusters without any public affiliates
(conglomerates or multidivisional firms in modern parlance) are not considered business groups. The
robustness of the results to changes in the definition of a group (where a group controls at least four
public companies) is discussed later.
We supplement the ownership data with information, also drawn from Moody’s manuals, on
each firm’s total assets, gross revenues and its year and State of incorporation. All the financial and
accounting data in this study are converted to constant 2005 dollars. 26
The nature of each company’s economic activity is characterized as a pure holding company
(with no operations); a semi-holding company (a holding company with operations) and a pure
operating company. Companies are also classified into several major industrial categories: railroads
(including underground and a variety of other transportation methods), public utilities (including gas,
fuel, coke, electricity, water, etc.), manufacturing and “other” (a default category for firms which do
not fall into any other category). These are sub-divided into more refined industrial sectors.27
4. Evidence on the Presence of Pyramidal Business Groups in the United States
Figure 2 summarizes our data on the size and incidence of business groups in the United States from
1926 to 1950. Business groups were large and prevalent in the 1930s and 1940s. The 1930s featured
25 to 29 business groups, collectively containing over 1,000 member firms in the early 1930s and
25

In the period we study there were no legal limits on the types of shares a company was allowed to issue. As a result,
companies could issue several classes of shares, each with a different set of voting rights (Becht and Delong, 2005).
Nevertheless, although several classes of shares could theoretically co-exist with pyramids, in the late 1920s, around the
beginning of our sample period, the New York Stock Exchange began to object to the issuance of new non-voting common
stock, an approach that “would seem to have eliminated the use of this device on any large scale in the immediate future”
(Berle and Means, 1932, pp. 71-72); however, other forms of dual class shares seem to have continued to exist. For the
purpose of this study we focus only on share classes with fixed voting power at the general shareholder meeting (typically
called “common stock,” although they could have other names). Stocks without voting power at all, or stocks with limited
and/or conditional voting power are not included. For companies classified as freestanding (where no individual or family
have direct control), we verify using the TNEC reports that no individual or family exercised control through voting trusts,
preferred shares or any other control-enhancing mechanism. In other cases, however, the exclusion of preferred shares or
other classes of equity could potentially bias our calculations towards overestimating ownership blocks and
underestimating wedge between ownership and control rights.
26
During the time period we study, there were no clear rules regarding the use of consolidated vs. unconsolidated financial
stgatements. Consolidation of financial reports occurred frequently, but not always, when the controlling ties between the
consolidated companies were very strong (e.g., 95-100% controlled subsidiaries). We try to separate whanever possible
consolidated and non-consolidated reports.
27
For the 200 B&M list corporations, we use the industrial classification provided by Berle and Means (1932), modified
using the classification provided in the Statistics of Income publications. In order to identify the industrial affiliation of
subsidiaries, we use company names and the description of the firm’s “occupation” in Moody’s manuals. Our industry
codes correspond to the 85 industries of the revised 1947 SIC tables, reported in 1958 (roughly similar to modern 3-digit
SIC codes).

about 1,000 towards the decade’s end. During this period, group-affiliates comprised about one third
of all US corporate assets and about one half of all non-financial assets.
Table 1 is a snapshot of US groups in 1932. Groups are evident in many industries. Among the
26 groups in our 1932 cross-section, ten had a presence in the public utilities sector and (according to
Moody) eight had public utilities as their primary line of business, 17 operated railroads or other
transportation-related services, eight controlled manufacturing affiliates, and nearly all were present in
one or more service sectors. These classifications are not mutually exclusive, as diversified groups
could operate in many industries. In 1932, 13 of the 26 groups had widely held apex firms and 13 were
capped by firms controlled by tycoons or business families (Figure 2a). For brevity, we call the former
widely held groups, though only their apex firms were in fact widely held.
Widely held groups were typically highly focused in two sectors: public utilities and
transportation (mostly railroads). Although some family controlled groups were as focused as the
widely held groups; others, notably the Du Pont and Mellon groups, were highly diversified,
resembling present-day family controlled business groups in emerging markets. Figure 3 summarizes
our data on the industrial focus of various groups. The figure measures horizontal focus using grouplevel equal-weighted sales-based Hefindahl-Hirschman indexes calculated across 85 3-digit industries
(group affiliates are actually present in only 24 of those sectors). The mean of around 0.8 indicates
high focus, and the median of 1.0 indicates that all of the median group’s member firms’ sales were in
a single industry. A high focus is even more evident in those groups that survived to 1950. Figure 3
measures vertical integration as in Fan and Lang (2000), who report a baseline vertical integration
index of 1.8% for US multi-segment firms in 1979-1982, and slightly higher figures in later periods.28
The group-level vertical integration index in our data is 1.3%, indicating that, on average, only 1.3% of
the output of a typical group-affiliated firm could be used as inputs by other firms in its group.29
Figure 4 describes the relative importance of business groups in different industries, rather than
the importance of different industries in business groups. In 1932, group-affiliated companies
accounted for some 80% of all assets in transportation services and public utilities; but groups were
also prominent in other capital-intensive heavy industries, such as chemicals and metals. Similar
patterns were evident in pre-war Japan and in emerging markets like Korea of the 1970s and 1980s,
28

To illustrate how this measure of vertical integration is calculated, Fan and Lang (2000) provide the following example
(p. 663): “In 1992, the total plastics output was $31,502 million. The total output of bags was worth $8,389 million. The
bags industry consumed $1,259 million worth of plastics (aij), whereas the plastics industry employed $10 million worth of
bags (aji) as an input. On a per-dollar basis, the bag industry consumed $0.15 (= 1,259/8,389) worth of plastics for each
dollar of bags produced (vij), whereas the plastics industry consumed $0.0003 (=10/31,502) worth of bags for each dollar of
plastics produced (vji). The vertical relatedness between the two industries is 0.0751 (Vij=1/2(vij+ vji), the average input
transfer between the two industries on a per dollar basis”. Comparisons of vertical integration measures constructed on the
basis of this methodology are sometimes difficult as they depend on the number of industries used and on whether or not
the diagonal of the input-output table (trade between two firms in the same industry) is taken into consideration or not. Our
figures are calculated at the 3-digit level and do not include trade between firms in the same industry.
29
Groups consisting of firms providing public utilities in different geographical regions are important in these statistics, as
they would be characterized as focused (undiversified) and not-vertically integrated.

and could reflect (among other things) preferential access to outside capital or well-functioning
internal capital markets.
The largest US groups of the 1930s were very large. In 1932, the Morgan Group, the largest in
our data, had revenues of $46 billion (2005 dollars). While this is only about one tenth of the revenues
of the largest American corporations today (Walmart or Exxon-Mobil), real US GDP is now fifteen
times larger, so the Morgan group of 1932 was about 50% larger, as a fraction of GDP, than today’s
largest US corporations. The 1932 revenues of the Morgan Group, which summed to about 6.5% of
GDP, make it comparable to some large Korean groups today: the revenues of each of Hyundai, LG
and SK constituted 6 to 7% of South Korea’s 2007 GDP. Samsung, the world’s largest group by this
metric, with revenues summing to about 14% of South Korean GDP, is about twice as large as the
Morgan Group (Colpan and Hikino, 2010, Table 2.3).
Figure 5 contrasts widely held and family controlled groups in 1932. The largest group, the
Morgan group, had a family controlled apex firm and member firms in numerous different industries;
the second largest, the Pennsylvania Railroad group, had a widely held apex firm and member firms
tightly focused in railways. Other large groups of 1932 included the widely held AT&T and the family
controlled Mellon and Van-Sweringen groups. On average, family controlled groups were larger, with
a mean value of $60 billion in assets (for the entire sample period in 2005 dollars), vs. only $28 billion
for widely held groups, though the difference is statistically insignificant.
Figure 6 portrays the pyramidal structures of several large groups in 1932. Pyramidal structures
were standard for both widely held and family controlled groups. Table 2 shows that, while the
common shares used to control group affiliates implied high average control-cash flow wedges relative
to freestanding firms, the common shares-based wedges of widely held groups’ member firms were
insignificantly different from those of family controlled group member firms. Although there is
variation in this respect across groups and over time (discussed below), in both family controlled and
widely held groups, the average common equity stake held by insiders was high, on the order of 70%.
Indeed, the mean intercorporate common equity stake is below 50% in only one group, the widely held
Pennsylvania Railroad in 1940.30
Thus, pyramidal business groups were common in the United States throughout the 1930s,
constituting a major part of the economy. 31 While many public utilities and transportation firms

30

The equity stakes we calculate refer to public companies only, where we measure the direct equity stakes of the
controlling shareholder or the controlling company in the subsidiaries or affiliates it controls. They are also based only on
each firm’s most important class of common shares. If preferred shares and other classes of common shares were
considered, some control blocks might well be much lower and some wedges much higher.
31
This statement contradicts Hilt (2014) who argues that ownership in the United States was dispersed even in the early
decades of the nineteenth century. Becht and DeLong (2005) describe a process by which ownership gradually became
more dispersed in many firms during the first half of the twentieth century. Holderness et al. (2002) find that managerial
ownership stakes were low in the United States even in 1935; they do not discuss overall ownership concentration, family

(notably railroads), belonged to pyramidal groups, most pyramidal groups were in other sectors.
While the former were industrially focused and often had widely held apex firms, the latter were more
apt to be family controlled and diversified across a range of manufacturing industries, thus resembling
pyramidal groups in emerging markets today. Finally, extreme wedges between control and cash flow
rights were uncommon in the common shares of most US business groups, both widely held and
family controlled.
5. Evidence on the Demise of Business Groups in the United States
Figure 2 shows the number and importance of business groups peaking in 1932, declining gradually
through the rest of the 1930s, and then dropping precipitously in the 1940s: The number of groups fell
from 28 in 1940 to 18 in 1950, 12 disappeared and two new groups formed as spinoffs of existing
groups. No entirely new business groups formed during this decade. The number of group-affiliates
declined from nearly 1,000 in 1940 to only 330 in 1950; and the share of group affiliates in total US
corporate assets collapsed from over 40% in 1940 to about 10% in 1950.
Table 3, listing the groups present each year, indicates that business groups did not disappear
completely, even by 1950. Some widely held groups (e.g., AT&T or Pennsylvania Railroad) survived,
as did a few family controlled groups (e.g., Du Pont or Rockefeller). However, Table 3 and (more
clearly) Figure 2a suggest that family controlled business groups were more likely to disappear than
widely held groups: families controlled about half of all groups before 1940, but only one quarter of
those still existing in 1950. In contrast, the number of widely held groups remained roughly stable.
Table 4 examines group disappearance by comparing descriptive statistics for the 18 groups
that survived through 1950 and the 35 that disappeared between 1929 and 1950:32 Small, family
controlled, diversified groups with more pyramidal levels were more likely to disappear than large,
focused groups with widely held apex firms. Moreover, Table 3 shows that the surviving groups
contained fewer firms. Moreover, their firms were organized in fewer pyramidal levels: The average
number of pyramidal levels in surviving groups fell statistically significantly from 2.8 in 1940 to 2.2 in
1950. Over the same period, the average common equity blocks used to control group-affiliates rose.
To further explore these changes, and to relate them to major regulatory changes, we move
from aggregate to group-level and firm-level data. We focus on groups disappearing between 1937 and
1950: a group ceases to exist if enough of its public member firms delist (through bankruptcy or a
takeover), are taken private, or become freestanding, leaving the group containing fewer than three
public companies and therefore no longer satisfying our definition. Of the 900 group-affiliates
control through trusts and foundations and indirect control chains within business groups; therefore, their findings are not
necessarily inconsistent with the results reported here.
32
The total number of groups which survived and disappeared (53) does not equal the total number of groups in Table 3
(55). The reason for this discrepancy is that two spin-off groups which first appeared in 1950 are not taken into account
when calculating the number of surviving groups.

undergoing such ownership changes between 1937 and 1950, 104 were public companies. We then
search for links between these ownership changes and specific reforms, which we now describe. Table
5 summarizes the reforms and their likely effects.
The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 mandated (and enforced)
rules for standardized financial disclosure, securities issuances and enhanced shareholder rights vis-avis corporate insiders. These two acts are widely regarded as the foundation of present day shareholder
rights in the United States. Although neither explicitly aims at business groups, both plausibly limited
tunneling – controlling shareholders extracting private benefits of control by shifting income from
other group firms to firms they directly own (Johnson et al., 2000) – or at least exposed such
transactions to shareholders and lawyers. If pyramidal groups existed because they offered controlling
shareholders scope for tunneling, these reforms presumably made groups less worthwhile to them.
We find circumstantial evidence consistent with this logic: First, US pyramids without
controlling shareholders were less likely than those with controlling shareholders to disappear in the
1940s. Johnson et al. (2000), Djankov et al. (2008) and others associate tunneling with private benefits
to a business group’s controlling shareholder, hence widely held groups may have been less prone to
tunneling.33 The relatively early disappearance of family controlled groups may therefore be
interpreted as evidence that groups whose raison d’être was less likely to be the diversion of private
benefits to their apex firm’s controlling shareholder were more likely to survive to 1950.
Second, surviving groups have smaller common equity control-cash flow wedges than do
disappearing groups (though Table 4 shows both figures to be small), and grow squatter over time
(their mean number of tiers drops from 2.8 in 1940 to 2.2 in 1950). Bebchuk et al. (2000) show how
tunneling is more lucrative to controlling shareholders whose pyramidal groups contain more tiers of
firms held together with smaller equity control blocks (i.e. their control-cash flow wedges are larger).
Both findings are thus consistent with surviving pyramids being less amenable to the diversion of
private benefits to controlling shareholders, and with a linkage between law and corporate ownership
structure (La Porta et al., 2008).

33

Tunneling in pyramids whose apex firms have a controlling shareholder typically entails the shifting of income from
lower tier firms upward to the apex firm, which then pay higher dividends to the controlling shareholder and lower
dividends to public shareholders of lower tier firms. How tunneling might work in pyramidal groups with widely held apex
firms is less obvious. Morck and Nakamura (2005) describe how the prewar Japanese Nissan pyramid used tunneling to
shift resources between member firms so as to maximize the shareholder value of its widely held apex firm. Presumably,
widely held apex firms would exhibit managerial shirking, empire building, risk avoidance, and other agency problems
associated with dispersed ownership.

The Public Utilities Holding Companies Act (PUHCA) of 1935
In the summer of 1934, President Roosevelt established the National Power Policy Committee (NPPC)
to study the public utility industry and propose legislation for it (Mahoney, 2012). The NPPC’s
investigation was simultaneous with two other investigations into holding companies, one by Congress
through the FTC, the other by the government through the Federal Power Commission (Funigiello,
1973). The FTC report concluded that “the detriment of utility holding corporations to the public has
exceeded, thus far, their value to the public” and recommended exercising Federal control over utility
holding companies through either taxation or direct prohibitive legislation. 34 To address concerns
about the anti-competitive effects of public utility pyramidal groups, given that antitrust regulation at
the time was considered inadequate (Roosevelt, 1935), Roosevelt promised that “among the subjects
that lie immediately before us is… the restoration of sound conditions in the public utilities field
through abolition of the evil features of holding corporations.”35 In August 1935, Congress passed the
PUHCA, also called the Wheeler-Rayburn Act.
The PUHCA imposed severe restrictions on public utilities – restricting intra-group loans and
dividends, and other transactions; limiting group-level lobbying, and drastically curtailing the use of
pyramiding in business groups with operating companies in public utilities. The last was spelled out in
the PUHCA’s so-called “Death Sentence Clause,” which stipulated that, to remain under common
control, public utility groups needed a connected infrastructure, operations in only one industry (i.e.
either electricity or gas), and a pyramidal structure no higher than two tiers –– a listed holding
company controlling listed operating subsidiaries.
The PUHCA was repeatedly challenged in court, and at first seemed likely to fall into juridical
oblivion. However, in 1940, a reconstituted Supreme Court not only upheld its key provisions, but
imposed a harsher interpretation on the courts and the SEC and allowed enforcement to begin. The
SEC sought to use the PUHCA to break up some groups, force others to divest unrelated companies
and operations in non-adjacent states, prevent group member firms from issuing non-voting shares,
and limit group firms’ leverage. The legal struggle over the implementation and interpretation of the
PUHCA only finally ended in 1946, when the Supreme Court reaffirmed the “Death Sentence Clause.”
The PUHCA remains in force.
We use the Seventeenth Annual Report of the SEC (1951) to identify companies and groups
whose structures or activities were listed by the SEC as subject to restructuring under the PUHCA
from 1937 to the end of the 1940s.36 Of the 900 group member firms that exited from business groups

See pp. 20, 26-27. The report, published after nearly seven years of investigation, covered holding and operating
companies with total assets of nearly $12 billion, all in public utilities. See also Energy Information Administration (1993),

Restructurings include “voluntary” proposals submitted by groups and approved by the SEC as well as “forced”
restructuring based on SEC directives issued under the provisions of the PUHCA. See SEC Annual Report, 1944, p. 65.

between 1937 and 1950, one sixth (149 firms) were on this SEC list. Of the 104 public firms that
exited from groups during this period, about a third, 34 firms, appeared on the list. The list includes
over a third of the public affiliates of five of the 12 groups that were present in 1940, but gone by 1950
(Doherty, Mellon, Morgan, Stone & Webster and Williams). The list also includes member firms in
the Commonwealth Edison and General Electric groups, which disintegrated between 1937 and
1940.37
Figure 7 summarizes changes around the advent of PUHCA enforcement in 1940. Figure 7a
shows the number of affiliates in groups whose primary business was public utilities falling off after
1937, and dropping faster in the 1940s. Figure 7b shows the average number of pyramidal levels in
surviving public utilities-focused groups falling from four in 1940 to two in 1950, in line with the
PUHCA provision stipulating no more than two levels in public utilities pyramids.
These findings are broadly consistent with the PUHCA having economic force. However, the
effect of this regulatory measure, like that of improved investor protection, is not discernible
immediately. Rather, Figure 8 shows many PUHCA-related divestments taking place in the 1940s.
Moreover, the PUHCA could not have destroyed all business groups in the United States because most
disappearing groups in the 1940s were not in public utilities and were thus not materially affected by
it. And, some public utilities groups persisted to 1950, albeit flattened to two-tier pyramids. These
findings are consistent with recent work arguing that the PUHCA was economically important (Morck,
2005a, p. 152; Bank and Cheffins, 2010; Mahony, 2012; Perez-Gonzales, 2014), but weigh heavily
against it being the sole factor responsible for the demise of pyramiding in the US.38
The Double Taxation of Intercorporate Dividends (1935)
In June 1935, Roosevelt sent a special tax message to Congress explicitly calling for tax incentives to
encourage the breakup of pyramidal business groups (Blakey and Blakey, 1935). Roosevelt's antipyramidal group tax strategy focused on the (multiple) taxation of intercorporate dividends. Figure 9
shows the statutory rate, initially barely 2% in 1935, rising at an accelerating rate to about 14% by the
37

There were 25 groups in 1937; seven disappeared by 1940 (of which two were subject to PUHCA action). Six spinoff
groups and four new ones were created by 1940.
38
Mahoney (2012) finds negative abnormal returns in utilities shares on news favorable to the PUHCA being enacted.
Perez-Gonzales (2014) finds that the PUHCA improved the performance of divested ex-pyramidal group member firms
(although it is not clear from this finding why these firms were not divested independently of the PUHCA). Bank and
Cheffins (2010) argue that the PUHCA was crucial in ending pyramidal groups which had already become rare in the
United States by the 1930s, and that those that still existed were in public utilities sectors. Their claims are not fully
consistent with data and findings reported here. In historical evaluations of the PUHCA, its effectiveness was controversial.
Anderson (1947) thought that the PUHCA did not imply the elimination of holding companies, but rather that their outlook
was “quite positive” and, though counting some 345 holding company divestitures by June 1945 (p. 251), he observes that
many others submitted reorganization plans for SEC approval. In contrast, SEC chair Harry McDonald (1951) counts 759
PUHCA-related divestitures, with gross assets summing to over $10 billion being divested by the end of 1950. He also
argues that the PUHCA reduced pyramidal groups’ geographic spread, counting 10 SEC-registered public utilities groups
operating in ten or more states and 14 operating in five or more states in December 1938, but none operating in ten or more
states and only eight operating in five or more states in 1950.

early 1940s. However, the power of the tax is its multiple application. In a pyramidal group, the
controlling shareholder’s dividend income ultimately depends on dividends paid to the apex firm by
subsidiaries, whose income depends on dividends paid them by their subsidiaries, and so on. Profits
earned by companies in the lowest tier of the pyramid must pass, as dividends, though all the levels of
the pyramid to become dividends payable to the controlling shareholder; so the intercorporate dividend
tax bites each time the money passes to a higher tier. Thus, the effective tax rate on a pyramidal
group’s controlling shareholder’s dividend income is the intercorporate dividend rate, compounded by
the number of tiers in the pyramid, plus the individual income tax rate applicable on her final
dividends received. 39 In virtually every other country, the intercorporate dividend tax is zero so the
only tax she pays is her final individual income tax (Morck 2005a).
Another roughly contemporaneous change in the tax law with implications for pyramidal
groups was new restrictions on filing consolidated group-level tax returns. This occurred in 1934 for
most groups, but not until 1942 for railroad groups, effectively exempting them from intercorporate
dividend taxes until then.40 Other reforms provided preferential tax treatment for parent firms that
liquidated or absorbed partially owned subsidiaries, and were designed as tax incentives to reward the
downsizing and simplification of pyramidal groups.
Like the PUHCA, the intercorporate dividend tax was explicitly designed to deter pyramiding
(Morck 2005a; Morck and Yeung 2005), and is thus another prime suspect in their actual demise.
However, empirically confirming its effect is problematic. While the SEC publicly named group
affiliates whose ownership or activities violated the PUHCA, the IRS published no comparable list of
large intercorporate dividend taxpayers. Moreover, while the PUHCA prohibits specific ownership
structures, the intercorporate dividend tax merely renders them costly. Nonetheless, evidence
suggestive of the tax being economically important is readily available.
First, intercorporate dividends declined after the tax took effect. In constant dollar terms, the
value of intercorporate dividends peaked in 1935, the year the intercorporate dividend tax began, and
then declined. The mid 1930s were the nadir of the Great Depression, so lower dividends can be
expected in these years. However, while corporate profits surpassed their 1929 levels by 1941 and rose
to 250% of that level by the end of the sample period, intercorporate dividends, as a fraction of
corporate profits, fell to insignificance. Figure 10 shows this by plotting intercorporate dividends as a

39

If the statutory intercorporate tax rate is τ, say τ = 10%, then $100 of earnings paid as dividends by a firm in the bottom
tier of a ten-tier-high pyramid is taxed ten times at the intercorporate rate before it reaches the ape firm, and ends up as a
dividend of $100 x (1 – 10%)10 = $34.87 for the ultimate controlling shareholder. This amounts to an effective tax rate of
65.13%, or 1 – (1 – τ)t, where t is the number of tiers of member firms between the ultimate source of the dividend and the
ultimate controlling shareholder. Of course, the ultimate controlling shareholder still has to pay individual income tax on
the $34.87.
40
Railroad groups alone could avoid the intercorporate dividend tax by paying a small consolidated tax and filing a single
consolidated tax return for the entire business group. In 1940, the only group in which the mean intercorporate common
equity stake is below 50% is the Pennsylvania Railroad group. In 1942, this option was eliminated.

fraction of all dividends: This ratio also peaks in 1935, the year in which the tax was introduced, and
then drops, falling dramatically and monotonically to negligible levels through the 1940s.
Second, groups restructured in ways that suggest they were trying to avoid, or at least
minimize, the burden of the intercorporate dividend tax. Figure 11 shows the mean common equity
stakes used to control group affiliates hovering around 75% in 1950, a 9-percentage point increase
from the 66% mean of level prevalent in 1940. After further tax reforms in 1942, dividends received
from affiliates controlled with equity stakes of 85% or more were exempt from the intercorporate
dividends tax, so the increase in control block size may reflect groups increasing their intercorporate
control blocks to avoid the tax. The decline in the number of pyramidal levels in surviving groups
between 1940 and 1950 evident in Figure 7b would also reduce the impact of the tax by reducing the
number of times it can be levied.
Third, the multiple application of the intercorporate dividend tax was designed to penalize
pyramidal groups’ controlling shareholders. As noted above, pyramidal groups with controlling
shareholders, and whose insiders therefore depended on dividend income passed up through tiers of
intermediate firms to their apex firms, were more apt to exit by 1950 than were pyramids with widely
held apex firms. Presumably, the insiders of these firms did not depend on dividend income, so the tax
burden was perhaps less pressing to them.
Finally, the Twentieth Century Fund (1937) lists thirty companies whose holding company
ownership structures it infers changed earlier in 1937 to avoid the intercorporate dividend tax. This list
includes two firms in our sample of group-affiliates, one in the Du Pont group, which survived until
1950, and another in the Mellon group, which disappeared between 1940 and 1950 and flags both as
explicitly citing the tax as motivating their restructurings.41 We conclude that the intercorporate
dividend tax is likely to have contributed meaningfully to the erosion of US groups.
The Investment Company Act (ICA) of 1940
The voting trusts that capped turn-of-the-century business groups had not disappeared entirely. Indeed,
the stock market boom of the 1920s saw the rapid growth of many closed end funds, listed companies
whose only assets were shares in other companies. Closed end funds are important parts of major
pyramidal groups elsewhere in the world today – for example, Investor, the apex firm of Sweden’s
Wallenberg family pyramid is a closed end fund. Roosevelt clearly saw this possibility too and, in a
1938 speech, called for the enhanced regulation of investment trusts both to improve investor

Inspection of the list reveals the other 28 groups in the list to be controlled by entities which do not control three public
firms and therefore are do not satisfy our definition of a business group.

protection and to prevent the undue concentration of economic power that they, like holding
companies, can provide. 42
The Investment Company Act (ICA) imposed sweeping new regulations on investment
companies, defined as listed firms whose assets primarily consisted of other firms’ shares. Obviously,
this could include apex firms or intermediate tier firms in some pyramidal groups. A company subject
to the ICA has to meet enhanced disclosure standards, obey strict limitations on leverage, restrict its
executives or shareholders from involvement in the management of companies whose shares it holds,
and engage in no related party transactions with those firms. Applied to a pyramidal group’s apex firm,
the ICA would force the controlling shareholder to become a passive investor in her corporate empire.
However, the ICA explicitly exempts holding companies in public utilities and railroads, as well as
holding companies whose equity stakes in their subsidiaries exceed 50%.
The SEC’s 1949 Annual Report lists investment companies and investment trusts subject to
action under the ICA, and none are among our sample of group affiliated firms. However, the ICA
went into full effect immediately, with none of the legal delays that initially blocked the PUHCA or
the gradual increase in pressure that occurred as intercorporate dividend tax rates rose. Figure 11
shows a very pronounced rise in intercorporate common equity control blocks in most groups. If the
increase were designed solely to meet the intercorporate dividend tax exclusion criterion, a minimal
stake of 85%, the observed increases would not have been sufficient. However, Figure 11 shows that,
in all groups, the 1950 common equity control stakes exceeded the 50% threshold required for
exemption from the ICA. The dearth of stakes below 50% in the 1950 data suggests that some
manufacturing-oriented groups may have restructured in the wake of the ICA to avoid having their
holding companies, or subsidiaries acting as holding companies, being classified as investment
companies. Of course, if the ICA were the only factor, intercorporate stakes would presumably have
clustered just above 50%. That many are far higher suggests other forces, perhaps the intercorporate
dividend tax 85% deductibility threshold or pressure from SEC-empowered shareholders.
Other Possibly Pertinent Policies:
Antitrust Enforcement, Estate Taxes, the Glass-Steagall Act and Railroad Regulation
Several other important reforms that took place in the 1930s and 1940s may also have indirectly
affected the viability of business groups. This section considers each in turn.
Becht and DeLong (2005) highlight US antitrust law as an important force in fragmenting US
business, beginning with the Supreme Court’s 1911 decision to uphold the Sherman Antitrust Act and
order the breakup of the Standard Oil pyramidal business group. In the 1920s, successive Coolidge
42

“The investment trust, like a holding company, puts huge aggregations of the capital of the public at the direction of a
few managers. Unless properly regulated, it has potentialities second only to the holding company as a device for further
centralization of control over American industry and American finance.” (Roosevelt, 1942, p. 126).

administrations defunded antitrust enforcement, and the Sherman Act became dead letter. The FTC
was reassigned to preapprove mergers, rather than investigate monopolistic practices. President
Roosevelt, speaking in 1938 (the speech was published in 1942), laments the weakness of antitrust
enforcement and promises to increase funding for it, but also proposes to use other regulatory tools to
curb the influence of groups in view of the deficiencies of the antitrust authorities at the time. This
weakness was reversed in the 1940s: Fligstein (1990, Table 5.1) documents a marked increase in
antitrust enforcement expenditures especially during the second half of the 1940s.
Using the sources cited in Posner (1970, footnotes 2 and 13), we create a list of disappearing
companies which also appeared as defendants in antitrust cases filed both by the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice and the FTC between 1929 and 1950. In line with President Roosevelt’s
rhetoric and Fligstein’s data (1990), antitrust enforcement was rare in the 1930s with only 66
documented enforcement cases. By contrast, we find 640 cases of alleged anticompetitive behavior
reported during the 1940s. However, of these cases, only 15 involved group-affiliated firms and only
four concerned public companies; even out of these four cases, two were dismissed. We conclude that
antitrust enforcement was probably not a major force in bringing about the demise of business groups
(See also Table 5).
Morck, Percy, Tian and Yeung (2005), documenting a decline of business groups in Canada
from 1910 through the 1960s and their resurgence thereafter, suggest as an explanation the
replacement of that country’s estate tax in the 1970s by a more easily avoidable (and deferrable via
family trusts) realization of capital gains on death. They report that at least some heirs had to downsize
their business groups, selling shares and firms to pay estate taxes. Figure 12 shows top US tax rates on
inherited income rising through the 1930s and stabilizing at unprecedentedly high levels in the early
1940s (Gale and Slemrod, 2001), suggesting that US business groups might have been forced to
downsize as heirs sold companies to pay huge estate taxes. Succession events, however, were not
particularly common in our sample period and Table 6 shows that those that did occur were not
obviously related to group disappearance.
Table 7 lists mechanisms commonly used by wealthy controlling families to avoid estate (and
other) taxes starting in early decades of the twentieth century. However, complete avoidance appears
implausible: Chernov (1990) describes an “avalanche” of art sales after J.P. Morgan’s death to pay the
estate taxes. Leaphart (1930) describes in detail a sequence of 1920s court cases criticizing and
restricting the extensive use of trusts and other devices to limit the tax liability of individuals. The New
Deal, in addition to raising top tax rates, closed off many tax loopholes and stepped up enforcement in
the 1930s (Brownlee et al., 2002, p. 786). Fack and Landais (2011) find charitable donations by the
wealthiest one percent of Americans correlating significantly with top marginal tax rates, but caution
that the value of these donations may often be overstated. Clotfelter (2012) describes the high
philanthropic funding of public goods as a form of American exceptionalism caused by its

exceptionally high estate taxes. Overall, while mechanisms to limit the applicability of estate taxes
were readily available during our sample period, it is unlikely that estate taxes were totally irrelevant
in the 1930s. Our data provide no clear evidence, and we therefore leave the role of taxes in forcing the
downsizing and exits of business groups unresolved.
A third major reform of the era, the Glass-Steagall (Banking) Act of 1933, forced banks to be
either commercial banks (taking deposits and making loans) or investment banks (engaged in
underwriting, active investment management, etc.) within one year. This potentially affected four
groups in our sample, which contained banks.43 The Morgan Bank, the financial firm in the Morgan
Group, the largest pyramidal group in our sample, opted to be a commercial bank. This decision may
well have impaired the Morgan Group’s internal capital market by making group affiliation less
worthwhile, and perhaps explains the group’s dissolution in the 1940s. The Stone &Webster Group
likewise contained a bank affected by the Act, and also disappeared in the 1940s. The Kuhn & Loeb
Group broke up in the 1930s and the Harriman Group survived until 1950. Obviously, the timing of
these dissolutions accords poorly with the 1934 deadline for compliance with the Glass-Steagall Act.
Moreover, both the Morgan and Stone & Webster groups contained many affiliates subject to the
PUHCA, which came into force in 1940 and so better fits their 1940s dissolutions. We therefore can
document no clear role for the Glass-Steagall Act in the demise of business groups in the United
States.
Finally, railroad groups occupied a regulatory domain of their own. After successive waves of
overbuilding bankrupted many railroads, solvent railroads complained that lines acquired in
bankruptcy sales, often by Morgan-financed buyers (Knight, 2014), unfairly undercut their prices.
Also, there were concerns that the Rockefeller’s Standard Oil group had negotiated especially low
freight rates, allegedly to drive independent oil companies into accepting takeover bids (Collier and
Horowitz, 1989). The federal railroad regulator, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), thus
came to perceive its mandate as keeping freight rates up. In what Huntington (1952), Stigler (1971),
and others characterize as an epitome of regulatory capture, railroads lobbied intensively to protect the
ICC’s turf from encroachments by rival regulators and the ICC worked tirelessly to protect the status
quo in the railroad sector. Within the government, the ICC was a powerful agency because it regulated
an industry that many politicians wanted to influence. The result was an environment in which the ICC
later sought to regulate trucking and shipping to control competition with railroads. The ICC was
emasculated in 1980, when railroads were deregulated, and abolished in 1995.44

43

We identify banks influenced by the Glass Steagall Act using a list of 17 defendant banks in the US vs. Henry Morgan
case (1947), a follow-up to Glass-Steagall Act, in which the banks were accused of attempting to monopolize the US
banking industry. The list is reported in Morrison et al. (2013).
44
The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 let carriers, rather than the ICC, set freight rates. The Interstate Commerce Commission
Termination Act of 1995 pulled the plug on the long moribund agency.

Our data contain no instances of the ICC restructuring railroad pyramids. The only regulatory
measure that clearly affected railroad pyramids was the intercorporate dividend tax, and only after
1942. Consistent with the tax having some effect, we observe a marked increase in the mean common
equity control stakes in two railroad groups that survived to 1950, the Pennsylvania Railroad and
Southern Railway (Figure 11). In the case of the Pennsylvania Railroad group, this accompanies a
dramatic downsizing of the group in the 1940s (Table 3). However, railroad groups also faced
dramatic changes in their economic environment: rising competition from trucking in the 1920s
(Goddard, 1996) and falling demand during the Great Depression of the 1930s both presumably took a
toll. Many disappeared in the 1930s (Table 3) without being subject to any new regulation.
The Political Climate of the Era
The Crash of 1929 devastated much of America’s middle class (Bernstein 1987). By 1932, stocks were
worth barely 10% of their 1929 peak valuations. Thousands of banks failed across the country, wiping
out depositors’ life savings. Fundamentally sound companies could no longer obtain working capital,
and followed their banks into bankruptcy by the thousands. By 1933, the official unemployment rate
was 25% and real GDP had fallen by almost half. Trade barriers halted agricultural exports and farm
prices plummeted. Surviving banks foreclosed on mortgages, and middle class Americans, grown
accustomed in the 1920s to having cars, telephones, electric home appliances, and homes or farms,
suddenly found themselves in poverty. The US government struggled to cope with tens of millions of
unemployed. From 1932 through 1934, the Senate Banking Committee, directed by Ferdinand Pecora,
exposed a long series of massive frauds and swindles that left many of Wall Street’s most powerful
figures wealthy, even as their investment clients lost everything (Perino, 2010). Unsurprisingly, many
Americans saw these unfolding disasters as the failure of capitalism.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came to power in 1932 on a wave of anti-business
sentiment, and sought to gain reelection by implementing a New Deal for middle class Americans that
would insulate them from the incompetence and rapacity of Wall Street. Earlier in the century,
Theodore Roosevelt came to power on a similar wave of anti-business populism that ran its course and
yielded to the renewed free market policies of the 1920s. Business leaders in the 1930s, and even the
1940s, might have hoped that Roosevelt’s New Deal, with its anti-pyramiding measures, might
similarly be soon reversed. However, the Depression dragged on; and, election after election,
Roosevelt swept back into power supported by solid Democratic majorities in Congress. Progressives
increasingly dominated the Supreme Court, whose Associate Chief Justice, Louis Brandies, had
achieved fame lambasting Wall Street and Big Business in his popular best seller Other People’s
Money – and How the Bankers Use It, first published in 1914 and reissued in 1933. As the years
passed, the New Deal became the new normal. Hopes for reversing its reforms faded, and business
groups had no choice but to acquiesce.

Robustness of the Results to Alternative Definitions of Groups
The definition of a group on the basis of common control over three or more publicly-traded
companies is, of course, arbitrary. Our main results, however, on the number of groups in existence in
each year and on the factors which affect their likelihood of survival remain unchanged when we
modify the definition of a group and require control of four public companies or more. The results are
presented in the Appendix: Appendix Figure 1 confirms that the trend in the total number of groups
and the proportion of family controlled vs. widely held ones are similar when a group is defined as
having four public affiliates or more. Appendix Table 1 confirms that the main differences between
surviving and disappearing groups are unchanged when the definition of a group is modified (although
not all differences are statistically significant).
6. Conclusions
The stylized facts documented here offer possible lessons for present-day policy makers in many
countries where regulatory measures to limit the role of business groups, and big business more
generally, are being considered. For example, anti-group regulation is unlikely to yield immediate
results, especially in an institutionally developed country with developed courts and property rights;
the effects we observe in our US data are mostly from the 1940s, a decade or so after the introduction
of anti-group regulation. Another lesson is that no single regulatory measure is a panacea for powerful
business groups. Instead, the US experience described here suggests that what may be needed is a
combination of regulatory measures, possibly including both direct structural restrictions on groups as
in the PUHCA and incentives for groups to downsize, as in divided taxation, applied consistently over
a long time period against the backdrop of an appropriate political climate.
In addition, the findings of this study may challenge certain aspects of the conventional
wisdom in the modern corporate governance literature. For example, one implication of the finding
that business groups thrived in the early twentieth century United States is that there seems to be no
inherent contradiction between the presence of business groups and common law. This buttresses
arguments, based on the importance of business groups in other common law countries – such as
Canada, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Malaysia and Singapore – against a common law legal origin
precluding business groups.
Our findings add historical evidence from the United States to the histories of corporate
ownership of other developed economies. Unlike the United States, the United Kingdom had dispersed
ownership throughout the twentieth century, regardless of formal measures of investor protection
(Franks et al., 2009); Japan, which was subject to an anti-big business policy shock (Yafeh, 1995;
Morck and Nakamura, 2005; Franks et al., 2014) around the same time the policies discussed here
were implemented in the United States, ended up with a quasi-unique corporate ownership structure

based on long-term cross shareholding arrangements. The United States, despite its institutional
proximity to the United Kingdom, had a concentrated ownership structure in the first half of the
twentieth century. And, the United States, despite the similarity to Japan in the spirit of anti-big
business policy measures, ended up with a very different ownership structure than Japan. These
historical comparisons suggest that the evolution of corporate ownership and the impact of financial
regulation are complex phenomena which vary with country-specific contexts. These findings call for
development of a new theory of the relation between the regulatory and legal environment and the
structure of corporate ownership.
The present study delineates an exciting research agenda. One interesting subject to explore
using our historical data set is the endogenous formation and disintegration of business groups at the
individual firm level: What types of firms were acquired by groups? Which firms were divested? Can
these patterns shed light on the economic reasons for the existence and demise of groups in the United
States? Another interesting research direction we intend to pursue has to do with the effect of group
disappearance on competition: Did the elimination of business groups foster competition in general or
in specific industries? Given that the anti-big business spirit of the 1930s was primarily motivated by
competition-related arguments, can we find evidence of changes in structure, conduct and performance
of some sectors in the US economy? Finally, we plan to test whether the demise of groups affected
financial development and the use of external finance in industries from which the groups disappeared.

Table 3: US Business Groups, 1926 – 1950
The table presents the number of group-affiliated firms (public in parentheses) by year and group from 1926 to 1950. A business group is defined as having three or
more public companies controlled by the same ultimate owner. The principal fields of activity (from Moody’s) are as follows: PU – public utilities; MF –
manufacturing, RR – railroads; CM – communications; FD – food products, including tobacco; ET – amusement.

Table 4: Surviving vs. Disappearing Groups
The table presents statistics for the entire sample period for surviving groups (established at any time during the period
1926-1940 and still in existence by 1950) and for disappearing groups (which do not exist in 1950). Industrial
Concentration is a Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index of group revenues in different industries; Ownership Stake is the
(average) direct common equity stake held by insiders in group firms; Vertical Integration is the average opportunity for
vertical integration in all lines of business (see text). One and two asterisks denote differences statistically significant at the
10 and five percent levels, respectively.

Table 6: Family Groups and Succession
The table presents, for the major family controlled groups, their year of disappearance and of the time of the controller's death
(* marks the death of a founder). Group longevity is the period of group existence (in years) after the controller’s death where
negative values indicate groups which disappeared before their controller’s death and positive values are for groups which
disappeared after their controller’s death.
