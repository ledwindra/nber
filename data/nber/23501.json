    "abstract": "\n\nEnsuring retirement income security is a priority for individuals, employers, and policymakers. Using merged administrative and survey data for public sector workers in North Carolina, we explore how workers\u2019 characteristics and preferences are associated with planning and saving for retirement. We then assess the \u201cquality\u201d of a retirement plan and whether retirement behavior is consistent with these plans.   The findings indicate that the way that individuals discount future consumption is associated with the extent of their retirement planning and preparedness.  We find that individuals who engage in retirement planning are better prepared to meet their retirement goals upon leaving their career jobs.\n\n",
