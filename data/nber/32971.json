    "abstract": "\n\nHow large is health inequality in middle age, and how does it shape subsequent economic disparities by race, ethnicity, and gender? Using the Health and Retirement Study, we document severe health disparities. At age 55, Black men and women exhibit the frailty levels, or the biological age, of White individuals 13 and 20 years older. Hispanic men and women show comparable frailty to White individuals 5 and 6 years older. Equalizing health at age 55 would reduce future disparities in many key economic outcomes by 40-70%. This suggests that targeted earlier health interventions for minorities could significantly narrow economic and quality-of-life inequalities in middle and old age.\n\n",
