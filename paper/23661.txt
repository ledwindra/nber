ABSTRACT
The world is experiencing the second largest refugee crisis in a century, and one of the major
points of contention involves the possible adverse effects of incoming refugees on host
communities. We examine the effects of a large refugee influx into Florida public schools
following the Haitian earthquake of 2010 using unique matched birth and schooling records. We
find precise zero estimated effects of refugees on the educational outcomes of incumbent students
in the year of the earthquake or in the two years that follow, regardless of the socioeconomic
status, grade level, ethnicity, or birthplace of incumbent students.

UNWELCOME GUESTS?
THE EFFECTS OF REFUGEES ON THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OF
INCUMBENT STUDENTS
1. Introduction
The world is experiencing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the end of World
War II. According to the figures released by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNCHR), as of the end of 2015, there were 65.3 million refugees and internally
displaced people around the globe – the largest number in history. More than a million Middle
Eastern refugees crossed into Europe in 2015, triggering a series of major political and
humanitarian crises as countries scramble to cope with the influx. The ripple effects of this new
wave of refugees are also felt across the Atlantic, with the number of asylum seekers from
Middle Eastern countries reaching record highs in the United States and Canada and sparking
spirited political debates. The main point of contention in debates on refugees is the possible
adverse effects of refugees on host communities; however, these debates mostly take place in
what is close to an empirical vacuum.
In this study, we present the first evidence, to the best of our knowledge, on the effects of
a large influx of refugees on the educational outcomes of incumbent students. We focus
specifically on one of the largest recent inflows of refugees into the United States – those who
entered immediately following the devastating earthquake on January 12, 2010 that killed more
than 200,000 people and affected a third of the population in Haiti; approximately 60,000
earthquake survivors moved to the United States immediately following the earthquake. We
make use of rich, longitudinal education microdata from the Florida – host to two-thirds of the
Haitian refugees -- to study this question. These data are exceptionally detailed, allowing us to
investigate the effects of Haitian refugees on a variety of incumbent students, including nonrefugee Haitian immigrants, U.S.-born students of Haitian ancestry, other non-Haitian immigrant
1

students, and so on. Over 4,000 refugee students entered Florida public schools by the end of the
2009-10 school year, and the overwhelming majority of these students enrolled in four school
districts, generating a significant influx of refugee students in certain schools.
A number of studies have examined the effects of immigrants on the labor market
outcomes of host communities 1, and there have been several recent analyses of the effects of
immigrants per se on the educational outcomes of incumbent students 2, though their conclusions
have been mixed. 3 But the effects of refugees might differ from the effects of immigrants on
native communities due to the fundamental differences between these two groups in the manner
in which they left their home countries. Immigrants typically make conscious choices to leave
their countries of origin seeking “a better life” elsewhere. On the other hand, the term “refugee”
refers to people who have to flee their countries due to an imminent threat to their lives such as
armed conflicts, persecution, and/or natural disasters, and hence are more likely to be

1

Most studies investigating the effects of immigrants on the labor market outcomes of natives find little or no effect
(e.g., Dustmann et al. (2008), Borjas (2013)), yet some find significant negative effects of immigrant influxes on the
wages and employment rates of low-skilled natives (e.g., Card, 2001). For a brief overview of the existing literature
in this context, see Akgündüz et al. (2015).
2
Using the large immigrant influx into Israel in the 1990s, Gould et al. (2009) exploit the cross-cohort, withinschool variation in immigrant concentration to study the effects of immigrants, and find a large adverse effect on the
high school dropout rates and high school matriculation test passing rates among native Israeli students. Similarly,
Jensen and Würtz-Rasmussen (2011) find negative effects of immigrant concentration on both native and immigrant
secondary school students in Denmark. In the United States, Betts and Fairlie (2003) and Cascio and Lewis (2012)
find that inflows of immigrants increase the native flight across school districts and from public schools into private
schools, especially among native-born white students in secondary grades. Further, using pooled 1980 and 1990
Census data, Betts (1998) finds a significant negative effect of immigrants on the likelihood of high school
graduation among black and Hispanic students in the United States. In contrast, there are several studies that find no
significant effect, or even a positive effect, of immigrants on the educational outcomes of native students. For
instance, Hunt (2012) finds that an increase in the immigrant share in the population increases the likelihood of high
school graduation among native-born black students in the United States. Similarly, Brunello and Rocco (2013) and
Geay et al. (2012) find small or no negative spillover effects of immigrants on natives, and Ohinata and Van Ours
(2013) and Schneeweis (2015) find large negative effects of immigrant concentration on the educational outcomes
of immigrant students, yet no significant effect on natives.
3
A closely related line of research examines the effect of racial/ethnic diversity in schools on student outcomes in
the United States. For example, Hanushek et al. (2009) and Hoxby (2000) investigate the effects of school racial
composition on the educational outcomes of black and white students in Texas, and find that a higher percentage of
black peers reduces the achievement of black students, but the effect on whites is generally insignificant and smaller.
Angrist and Lang (2004) reach similar conclusions examining the school desegregation program in Boston.

representative of, or even less advantaged and more marginalized than, the general population in
their countries of origin (Cortes, 2004). Refugees generally are more impoverished with lower
earnings than economic migrants, and have lower levels of education and language skills when
they arrive (Connor, 2010; Potocky-Tripodi, 2004). 4 And while refugees ultimately – after a
period of six to ten years -- have higher labor force participation and employment rates, and have
similar welfare participation rates, relative to U.S.-born residents, they often enter the U.S. with
low human capital and language skills and have initially poor labor market outcomes and high
rates of welfare usage (Evans and Fitzgerald, 2017). Therefore, it is plausible to expect that
refugees might have a very different (and likely more adverse) effect on incumbent students as
school districts and schools shift resources away from native students to accommodate the needs
of refugees.
The biggest challenge in revealing the causal effect of refugees on incumbent
communities is that refugee students are not randomly assigned to schools and communities. In
fact, prior research has shown that refugees, and recent immigrants in general, are more likely to
settle in neighborhoods with larger shares of immigrants from their country of origin (see, e.g.,
Card, 2001). To deal with this selection issue, we make use of the within-school, across-grade
variation in the volume of entering refugees to explore the effects on the educational outcomes of
existing students including test scores, disciplinary incidents, and student mobility across
schools. We also use the birth dates of refugee students as an instrument for their grade
placement to deal with the possible strategic placement of refugee students across grades within
schools. We find precisely estimated zero effects (with occasional positive estimates as well) of
refugees on the educational outcomes of incumbent students in the year of the earthquake or in

larger numbers of other refugees.

the two years that follow, regardless of the socioeconomic status, grade level, or the birthplace of
incumbent students.

2. The Haitian Earthquake of 2010
A powerful 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince on January
10, 2010, killing more than 200,000 people and affecting more than three million people (almost
a third of the country’s entire population), more than a million of whom were left homeless.
After the earthquake, the United States granted 60,000 Haitian refugees temporary protected
status which provided relief from deportation and work authorization until January, 2016. Of
those 60,000 refugees, 38,000 settled in Florida. 5
This influx of Haitian refugees also led to a sizeable refugee shock in Florida public
schools. In the first two months after the earthquake, more than 2,000 Haitian refugees entered
Florida public schools, and roughly 4,000 entered by the end of the spring semester in 2010. 6
Figure 1 portrays the distribution of Haitian immigrants entering Florida public schools during
the spring semesters between 2003-04 and 2011-12 school years, suggesting that the number of
Haitian immigrants entering the public school system in Florida more than quadrupled in Spring
2010, and reverted to its pre-2010 levels in the following year. Table 1 presents the number of
schools by refugee concentration, broken down by grade level, indicating that approximately 40
percent of the schools in Florida did not receive any Haitian refugees in Spring 2010 whereas the
share of Haitian refugees exceeded one percent of the student body in 100 schools in Florida.
Figure 2 maps these 100 schools, which we call “top refugee-receiving schools” in the remainder

(Broward, Miami-Dade, Orange, and Palm Beach).

3. Data and Empirical Strategy
In this study, we use student-level administrative data from Florida that provide detailed
information about all students enrolled in a public school between 2002-03 and 2011-12. School
records contain reading and math scores on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT)
of all students between grades three and ten, along with a wealth of student characteristics
including student demographics (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender), free-or-reduced-priced lunch
(FRPL) eligibility, measures of English proficiency (limited English proficiency indicator and
language spoken at home), detailed information about disciplinary incidents (including the
precise date of the incident), and special education status. More importantly for the purposes of
this study, we observe the country of birth and the entry dates of all students to the schools they
attended in a given school year, which allow us to identify Haitian refugees who entered the
Florida public school system after the earthquake. We also observe home language, which allows
us to identify U.S.-born students of recent Haitian descent.
For the purposes of this research agenda, the Florida Departments of Education and
Health linked these student-level administrative data with student birth records for every child
born in Florida between 1992 and 2002. Birth records offer background information not typically
seen in school records such as parental education, providing additional measures of student
socioeconomic status. Because the birth-school match is based on full name, exact date of birth,

5

and social security numbers, the birth and school records are virtually perfectly matched (Figlio
et al., 2014). 7
Table 2 compares the characteristics of Haitian refugees (first column) with immigrants
who entered Florida public schools in Spring 2010 (second column) and Haitian immigrants who
entered the school system during spring semesters before the earthquake (third column).
Compared with Haitian immigrants in other years, Haitian refugees are significantly more likely
to be economically disadvantaged, and while they are just as likely to be non-native English
speakers, they are much more likely to be identified as limited English proficient upon entry into
the school system. In particular, almost 90 percent of Haitian refugees were eligible for free or
reduced price lunch (compared to 63 percent for other immigrants in Spring 2010 and 72 percent
for Haitian immigrants in other spring semesters), and 91 percent were limited English proficient
(compared to 74 percent for other immigrants in Spring 2010 and 52 percent for Haitian
immigrants in other spring semesters). Haitian refugees also are more economically
disadvantaged and have lower facility in English than are immigrants from other countries
arriving in Spring 2010. In sum, Haitian refugees are considerably more needy than other
immigrants – Haitian or otherwise.
The previous literature has shown that recent immigrants are more likely to settle in
neighborhoods with larger shares of immigrants, typically from their countries of origin. 8 This is
also the case for Haitian refugees, as demonstrated in Table 3. Existing students in refugeereceiving schools are significantly more likely to speak Haitian Creole, more likely to have been

7

As Figlio et al. (2014) demonstrate, the match rate is essentially identical to that which would have been predicted
based on the American Community Survey data.
8
Immigrants also tend to be concentrated in part because native students frequently leave schools when facing a
major immigrant influx (Schindler-Rangvid (2010), Gerdes (2010), Betts and Fairlie (2003), and Cascio and Lewis
(2012)).

born abroad, and in Haiti in particular, have significantly lower prior achievement levels, are
more likely to be FRPL eligible, less likely to be white, and more likely to be limited English
proficient. Florida-born students in these schools are also less likely to have educated mothers.
These stark differences in baseline characteristics imply that the observed differences in student
outcomes are likely to be contaminated by differences in unobserved student traits between
schools that received refugees versus others.
To deal with this selection issue, following Gould et al. (2009), we rely on within-school,
across-grade variation in refugee concentration to study the effects of the refugee influx on
incumbent students. In particular, we estimate the following equation:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(1)

where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the year t educational outcome of student i who attended school s and grade g in

Spring 2010, 𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the percentage of Haitian refugees in grade g and school s in Spring 2010, 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠

and 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 are the fixed effects of the school and the grade that student i attended in Spring 2010
respectively. 9 As primary outcomes of interest we use test scores in reading and math

standardized to zero mean and unit variance at the grade-year level, an indicator for whether the
student was involved in a serious disciplinary incident resulting in a suspension, and student
mobility (i.e., whether the student moved to another school or left the Florida public school
system altogether by Fall 2010 or Fall 2011). We also create a performance index using the
estimated coefficients of test scores and disciplinary incidents in 8th grade in a regression where
we predict on-time high school graduation (Appendix Table A1 presents the means and standard

In some specifications, we also include a vector of student characteristics (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) including prior test scores,
disciplinary incidents, and student demographics to check the robustness of our findings. We adjust all standard
errors for clustering at the school level.

deviations of our outcome variables in Spring 2010 along with the two school years that follow
for refugee-receiving and top-refugee receiving schools in our sample). 10
In our analysis, we focus on the within-cohort refugee concentration in Spring 2010
because it is less likely that incumbent students were able to respond to the unexpected refugee
influx (e.g., by changing schools) immediately after the earthquake. Therefore, it is more
plausible to expect that the cross-grade variation in refugee concentration in Spring 2010 is
uncorrelated with the observed and unobserved characteristics of existing students within
schools, which is the critical assumption behind our identification strategy here. Table 4 checks
the validity of this assumption by replacing student outcomes with student and teacher
characteristics (experience and level of education, averaged at the school-by-grade level) in
model (1) and estimating the equation with and without school fixed effects, for all schools and
top refugee-receiving schools separately. The findings reported in the first and third columns
reveal strong correlations between baseline characteristics and refugee concentration across
schools, yet these correlations vanish in almost all cases when school fixed effects are introduced
– at least for the top refugee-receiving schools that are the focus of our analysis.
While these findings provide suggestive evidence that our identification assumption is
valid, it is still plausible that school administrators strategically place refugees in grades based on
unobservable factors. For this, we use the age distribution of entering refugees in each school as
an instrument for the refugee concentration. In particular, using 2SLS, we also estimate:
𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝜙𝜙 + 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 + 𝜈𝜈𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜌𝜌 + 𝜇𝜇𝑅𝑅�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 + 𝜗𝜗𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
10

(2)

In particular, using 5 cohorts of first-time 9th graders between 2003 and 2007, we regress an indicator of whether
the student received a standard high school diploma in four years after entering the 9th grade for the first time on 8th
grade reading and math scores, and an indicator of whether the student was involved in a disciplinary incident in the
8th grade. Using the estimated coefficients (0.07 for reading, 0.10 for math, and -0.23 for disciplinary incident), we
construct a performance index for all students in our sample for whom test scores are available.

8

where 𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the number of refugees who entered school s and were age-appropriate for grade g,
divided by the number of existing students enrolled in the same school-grade. Appendix Table 2

presents the correlations between 𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 and student and teacher characteristics (once again

averaged at the school-by-grade level) for all schools and top-receiving schools, providing
further evidence supporting the exogeneity of the instrument. Especially when we restrict our
attention to the top refugee-receiving schools, which together account for 40 percent of the total
Haitian refugee population, there is little evidence of a within-school relationship between
covariates and the age distribution of refugees.
4. Results
We next turn to investigating the relationship between refugee concentration and
incumbent student outcomes following the earthquake. We consider three years of postearthquake data: Spring 2010, when refugees were still entering the schools, 11 and in the 2010-11
and 2011-12 academic years, after the refugee absorption was essentially complete. Table 5
presents the effects of refugee concentration on incumbent student test scores in reading and
math, disciplinary incidents, and our index of performance, estimated using OLS for all refugeereceiving schools and top refugee-receiving schools in Spring 2010 (first panel), 2010-11 school
year (second panel), and 2011-12 school year (third panel). Appendix Table 3 presents the same
effects estimated using IV models. In models without school fixed effects, it appears as if more
refugees are associated with worse student outcomes (negative relationships with test scores and
the performance index and positive relationships with disciplinary incidents), but this is entirely
driven by differential selection into the schools that Haitian refugees attend. Indeed, as soon as

11

The FCAT was administered in Spring 2010 between March 9-19, only two months following the earthquake. At
that point, only around half of the Haitian refugees who would ultimate attend Florida public schools by the end of
that academic year had even entered the schools.

9

we control for school fixed effects and consider only the naturally-occurring variation in refugee
concentration across grades within the same school, the negative relationships disappear and the
estimates are invariably non-negative 12, and even positive with respect to reading test scores in
the top refugee-receiving schools where most of the refugees attend. In the top refugee-receiving
schools, our preferred estimates (those with both school fixed effects and student covariates
included) in Spring 2010 indicate that each percentage point increase in refugee concentration is
associated with 0.6 to 0.7 percent of a standard deviation increase in reading test scores and 0.3
to 0.4 percent of a standard deviation in math test scores, and 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points fewer
disciplinary incidents 13. The estimates are of approximately the same magnitudes in the 2010-11
and 2011-12 school years as well. These are very modest estimates, but none suggest a
deleterious effect of refugees on incumbent students in the initial year of the earthquake. Indeed,
the standard errors in our preferred models are sufficiently small that we could statistically detect
effects of smaller than one percent of a standard deviation changes in test scores (1.5 percent of a
standard deviation in the IV models) for every percentage point increase in the refugee
concentration. 14 Given that only four Florida schools had a refugee concentration of over five
percent of their school population, our take-away is that we have estimated precise zero (except
in the case in which we estimate precise but very modest positive) effects of refugees on the
incumbent population’s test scores and disciplinary problems.

12

A negative coefficient when the dependent variable is the presence of a disciplinary incident is evidence of a
positive outcome.
13
We tend to prefer the test score outcomes to those regarding disciplinary incidents, because classroom disciplinary
policies may be affected by student body composition but the tests, which are state-administered and centrallygraded, are not influenced by student body composition.
14
We also estimate models where we cluster standard deviations at the district level. Standard errors increase
modestly, but they are still sufficiently small to detect statistically significant effects as small as 1.5 – 2 percent of a
standard deviation in test scores for every percentage point increase in the refugee concentration.

10

Appendix Table 4 examines the extent to which the second and third year effects
observed in Table 5 are driven by differential student attrition from the sample. In this exercise,
we re-estimate (using our preferred specification that includes school fixed effects and student
covariates) the effects of refugee concentration on student test scores, disciplinary incidents, and
the performance index using all students (columns labeled as (I)), using students who remained
in the sample in 2010-11 school year (columns labeled as (II)), and using students who remained
in the sample in 2011-12. The first year effects remain unchanged, providing evidence that
differential attrition is not a major issue for our second and third year estimates. 15
Table 6 examines the effects of refugee concentration on the likelihood of incumbent
student mobility in the following two years, estimated using OLS (IV results are presented in
Appendix Table 5). While models that do not include school fixed effects provide some evidence
of increased incumbent student mobility across Florida public schools, most of these
relationships vanish when we account for differences in student mobility across schools. In our
preferred specification that includes school fixed effects and student covariates using top
refugee-receiving schools, OLS estimates suggest that one percentage point increase in refugee
concentration increases the likelihood of student movement to another public school by Fall
2010 by 0.1 percentage points while decreasing the likelihood of exiting the school system by the
same amount. Similarly, one percentage point increase in refugee concentration increases withinschool system student movement by 0.01 percentage points, and decreases the likelihood of
exiting the school system by 0.5 percentage points by Fall 2011. Of these estimates, only the

15

We also conduct a bounding exercise (results are available upon request) to assess the extent of differential
student attrition. In this exercise, we assign each student who leaves the Florida public school system by Fall 2010
or Fall 2011 a test score that corresponds to the 5th percentile (lower bound) or the 95th percentile (upper bound) of
the test score distribution in reading and math, or a disciplinary incident value of zero (lower bound) or one (upper
bound), and re-estimate our preferred specification that includes school fixed effects and student covariates. In
summary, the overall evidence indicates that refugees had little negative – and potentially even positive – effects on
incumbent students’ outcomes in the two years following the earthquake.

11

effect on Florida public school system exit by Fall 2011 is statistically significant at conventional
levels, suggesting that more Haitian refugees might have decreased the likelihood that students
would leave affected schools, and again, the magnitudes of this difference are quite small.
One possible mechanism behind these precisely estimated zero effects of refugees on
incumbent students is that refugees are placed in different classrooms within grades. To see
whether this is the case, columns labeled as (I) in Table 7 presents the differences in incumbent
student characteristics between refugee-receiving classrooms and others in refugee-receiving
schools and top refugee-receiving schools, controlling for school-by-grade fixed effects. The
results reveal significant differences between refugee-receiving classrooms and others although
refugee students were by no means completely isolated from incumbent students. For instance,
refugees are significantly more likely to be placed in classrooms with higher shares of Haitianborn students (38 percent versus 12 percent in top refugee-receiving schools), Haitian-Creole
speakers (49 versus 30 percent), and higher shares of limited English proficient students (54
versus 12 percent). Given that 90 percent of all Haitian refugees were identified as limited
English proficient (LEP) upon entry into the Florida public school system, these discrepancies
might be explained by some schools instructing LEP students in separate classrooms than fluent
English speakers (i.e., sheltered classrooms). 16 Indeed, when we control for the LEP status of
incumbent students (in columns labeled as (II)), differences in classroom characteristics diminish
dramatically. For instance, incumbent students in refugee-receiving classrooms within top

16

The Florida Department of Education uses several instructional models for English learners including (1)
sheltered models where English learners are placed in separate classrooms only for English courses; (2) sheltered
models where English learners are placed in separate classrooms for core/basic subject areas; (3)
mainstream/inclusion models where English learners are placed in the same classrooms with non-English learners
for English courses; (4) mainstream/inclusion models where English learners are placed in the same classrooms with
non-English learners for core/basic subject areas; (5) Maintenance and/or developmental bilingual education where
English learners are instructed in two languages in separate classrooms for all subjects; and (6) Dual language (twoway developmental bilingual education) where all students are instructed in two languages for all subjects.
Throughout the rest of the paper, we call schools that use the first two models “schools with sheltered classrooms”.

12

refugee-receiving schools are 19 percentage points more likely to be Haitian Creole speakers
compared to incumbent students in other classrooms, yet this differences shrinks to 3 percentage
points once we control for the LEP status of the incumbent students.
Refugees might have had different effects on different groups of incumbent students, and
the Florida data provide us with the opportunity to study these differential relationships along
several dimensions. This exercise is particularly important given the evidence that some student
groups were more likely to be subjected to refugees (e.g., LEP students, students in schools with
sheltered classrooms). First, we consider separately the effects of refugee concentration for
Haitian-born students (12 percent of the incumbent population of the top refugee-receiving
schools), other non-Haitian foreign-born students (9 percent), U.S.-born Haitian Creole speakers
(29 percent), U.S. born black students who are not Haitian Creole speakers (38 percent), other
nonblack U.S. born students (24 percent), LEP students (18 percent), and non-LEP students. We
present this breakdown in the first panel of Table 8, which, for the sake of brevity, presents the
estimated effects of refugee concentration on the performance index only 17, and check the
equivalence of incumbent student baseline characteristics for each student subgroup in Appendix
Table 6. (The first panel of Table 9 repeats the same analysis looking at incumbent student
mobility.) We observe that, across all groups of incumbent students, there is little evidence of a
negative effect of refugees on incumbent students’ test scores; while we observe the occasional
negative estimated relationship, there are many more positive estimated relationships regarding
student performance, and none of the performance estimates are distinguishable from zero. We
also find little evidence that more refugees let to increased out-migration of students. Our general
read of this evidence is that the concentration of refugees has no substantial negative effect on

17

The effects estimated separately for test scores and disciplinary incidents are similar and available from the
authors upon request).

13

the short-term outcomes of incumbent students regardless of place of birth, spoken language, or
race/ethnicity.
For Florida-born students, we can investigate differences in outcomes by maternal
education levels, and we report these findings in the second panel of Table 8, with incumbent
student mobility results presented in the second panel of Table 9, and baseline equivalency
checks presented in Appendix Table 7. Because refugees tend to attend relatively low-SES
schools, we break down the Florida incumbent students into those whose mothers have not
completed their high school degrees, those whose mothers have a high school diploma but no
further education, and those whose mothers have at least some college education. Regardless of
maternal education level, we continue to find no evidence that refugee students substantially
harmed the educational outcomes of any group of incumbent students.
Finally, the effects of a Haitian refugee influx on incumbent students might differ based
on the share of existing Haitian students in the school, by grade level, school size (above or
below the median size), or by the type of LEP instructional model the school employs. This
might arise, for instance, if schools with sizable Haitian student populations are more likely to
have established support systems for immigrants from Haiti such as Haitian-Creole speaking
counselors, which might ease the transitional burden for the incoming refugees. In the third
through sixth panels of Table 8, we break down the analysis by the share of existing HaitianCreole speakers (15 percent versus 40 percent, the 25th percentile versus the 75th percentile
among top refugee receiving schools) and grade level in top refugee receiving schools whereas
the third through sixth panels of Table 9 presents the mobility results and Appendix Table 8
checks the baseline equivalency of incumbent students. The estimated effects suggest no
discernable differences in the effects of refugee concentration on student outcomes by school

14

characteristics. While the occasional estimated coefficient is significantly positive or negative,
the overall pattern of findings indicates a zero effect of refugees on incumbent students.
4.1. Robustness Checks
To identify the causal effect of refugee concentration on student outcomes, we rely on the
within-school, across-grade variation in refugee concentration. An important challenge in this
approach is the possible strategic placement of refugees across grades by school administrators.
The findings we have presented thus far reveal that the OLS and IV estimators, the latter of
which deal with this possible endogeneity using the naturally-occurring age distribution of
entering refugees, yield comparable results, providing evidence that our OLS estimates are not
contaminated by strategic placement of refugees. To further investigate the strategic placement
of refugees across grades within schools, we also present a falsification exercise where we
estimate (1) using student outcomes during the two years prior to the earthquake. If the crossgrade, within-school differences in refugee concentration were actually driven by endogenous
factors, one would expect to find a relationship between the refugee concentration in 2010 and
outcomes in 2007-08 and 2008-09. The findings, reported in Appendix Table 9, reveal no such
placebo effect, providing further evidence against strategic placement. Not only are the estimated
relationships between the would-be within-school refugee concentration in 2010 and preearthquake outcomes not statistically significant at conventional levels, but they are also very
small in magnitude: For example, the estimates indicate that a one-percentage-point increase in
the refugee concentration in a given grade is associated with tiny fractions of a standard
deviation reductions in reading and math, respectively, in models that include school fixed
effects and student covariates.

15

Another important challenge in our empirical approach is the possibility that there is
insufficient variation in refugee concentration across grades within schools, which would lead to
zero effects of refugee concentration on incumbent student outcomes. Appendix Figure 1
portrays the within-school, cross-grade range in refugee concentration in each top refugeereceiving school, and shows that about a quarter of these schools (25 schools) have cross-grade
range of at least 5 percentage points in refugee concentration, and about one-tenth (9 schools)
have cross-grade range of at least 10 percentage points. Appendix Table 10 presents the OLS
estimates of the effects of refugee concentration on student test scores and misbehavior in the
first, second, and third year after the earthquake, estimated using school fixed effects and student
covariates, restricting the sample to these high-variance schools. Once again, the findings reveal
no adverse effect of refugees on the educational outcomes of incumbent students. In fact, when
we use the schools with largest cross-cohort range in refugee concentration, we find a
statistically significant positive effect of refugee concentration on incumbent student math scores
in the first two years. 18
Finally, we employ two alternative empirical strategies to our within-school analysis to
check the robustness of our findings. First, in a difference-in-differences framework we explore
the relationship between refugee concentration and within-student variation in student test scores
and disciplinary incidents using student fixed effects, following individual students between the
2008-09 and 2011-12 school years. 19 In particular, using OLS we estimate:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜐𝜐 + 𝜎𝜎𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑔𝑔 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜙𝜙𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

18

In Appendix Table 11, we also repeat the same analysis excluding outlier top refugee-receiving schools with
refugee concentrations larger than 5 percent, and reach the same conclusion.
19
In this exercise, we restrict the sample to students that we observe in all 4 years between 2008-09 and 2011-12.
We lack power to estimate this model with multiple pre-earthquake years of data.

16

(3)

where 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 is a vector of year dummies for Spring 2010, 2010-11, and 2011-12 school years,

and 𝜙𝜙𝑡𝑡 , 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 , and 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 are year, student, and grade fixed effects. Appendix Table 12 presents the

results, and shows that refugee concentration increases reading performance among incumbent
students, but it also leads to an increase in disciplinary incidents. We do not find any significant
effects of refugees on incumbent student math scores.
Second, the birth-school match enables us to identify sets of siblings in our Florida-born
student sample, and we use these identifiers to estimate the effect of refugee concentration on
incumbent student outcomes in a family fixed effects framework. In particular, using the sample
of Florida born students who were attending a Florida public school in Fall 2009 and who had at
least one sibling in the school system, we estimate
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑓𝑓 + 𝜃𝜃𝑔𝑔 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(4)

where 𝛿𝛿𝑓𝑓 is family fixed effects. Appendix Table 13 presents the effects on incumbent student
outcomes in Spring 2010, 2010-11, and 2011-12 without family fixed effects and student

covariates (columns (I)), including family fixed effects (columns (II)), and including both family
fixed effects and student covariates (columns (III)). In our preferred specification where we
control for both family fixed effects and student covariates, we do not find any significant effect
of refugee concentration on student test scores or disciplinary incidents.
5. Concluding Remarks
Understanding the effects of refugees on incumbent communities is more important than
ever as the world faces the second largest refugee crisis in a century. In this study, we present the
first evidence on the effects of a major refugee influx on the educational outcomes of incumbent
students using the wave of Haitian refugees who entered Florida public schools after the
devastating earthquake in January 2010. We find no significant adverse effect of refugees on the
17

educational outcomes of incumbent students including test scores, disciplinary incidents, and
student mobility across schools. While we tend to find many more positive estimates than
negative estimates, the weight of the evidence indicates that refugees have a precisely estimated
zero effect on incumbent students’ outcomes, both immediately following the arrival of refugees
and up to two years afterward.
That said, there are several factors that might hinder the generalizability of our findings
to other contexts. There is an established and sizeable Haitian immigrant population in Florida
and as we have shown earlier Haitian refugees enrolled in schools with considerable Haitian
student populations. These schools might already have support systems in place to help recent
immigrants from Haiti such as Haitian Creole speaking counselors, and hence might be more
prepared to accommodate an influx of Haitian refugees, minimizing the adverse effects on
existing students. Such support systems might not exist in other contexts (such as the Syrian
refugee crisis in Europe) and hence the negative externalities of refugees on incumbent students
might be more severe. That said, recall that Haitian Creole speakers were still a small minority of
incumbent students in almost every refugee-receiving school prior to the 2010 earthquake. Just
six percent of the incumbent student body of the typical refugee-receiving school spoke Haitian
Creole, and only half of all Haitian immigrants (not counting native-born Haitian Creole
speakers) are considered limited English proficient. Limited English proficient Haitian Creole
speakers account for more than ten percent of the incumbent student body population in only 78
schools, and more than twenty percent of the incumbent student population in just 26 schools.
Therefore, it is unlikely that there existed substantial educational or social services for Haitian
immigrants in all but a relative handful of schools.

18

In summary, there appears to be little evidence that a sizeable influx of refugees has
short-term negative consequences on native students. Taken together with new evidence by
Evans and Fitzgerald (2017) that after a period of adjustment, refugees have similar economic
outcomes, across several dimensions, to comparison U.S.-born natives, and ultimately pay more
in taxes than they receive in benefit, these findings indicate that the potential negative
externalities associated with refugee admissions are likely lower than some may worry.

Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at the school level are given in parentheses. Each entry represents the
estimated correlation between within-school age distribution of Haitian refugees and the corresponding student
attribute or teacher attribute. Regressions using all refugee-receiving schools include 865,399 unique student
observations, or 473,465 unique prior year test scores, or 438,187 Florida born students for whom maternal
characteristics are available, or 4,493 school-by-grade average teacher characteristics. Regressions using the top
refugee-receiving schools include 72,407 unique student observations, or 39,678 unique prior year test scores, or
36,309 Florida born students for whom maternal characteristics are available, or 524 school-by-grade average
teacher characteristics. Novice teachers are defined as teachers with no prior experience; early career teachers are
identified as those with 1-3 years of experience; mid-career teachers are identified as teachers with 4-10 years of
experience, and late career teachers are teachers with more than 10 years of experience. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p

Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at the school level are given in parentheses. In all regressions we restrict the
sample to students with at least one sibling in the school system. Numbers in brackets represent the number of
observations used in the corresponding specification. Each column represents the effect of within-cohort refugee
concentration in Spring 2010 on the test scores and disciplinary incidents of incumbent students in Spring 2010,
2010-11, and 2011-12, estimated using OLS. Columns labeled as (I) and (II) only include students with non-missing
lagged outcome variable for the outcome specified. Columns labeled as (III) introduce the student characteristics
(other than maternal attributes) listed in Table 4. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
