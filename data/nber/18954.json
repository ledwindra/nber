    "abstract": "\n\nWe provide a new and superior measure of U.S. GDP, obtained by applying optimal signal-extraction  techniques to the (noisy)  expenditure-side and  income-side estimates.  Its properties - particularly as regards serial correlation - differ markedly from those of the standard expenditure-side measure and lead to substantially-revised views regarding the properties of GDP.\n\n",
