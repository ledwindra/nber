Rain or Shine: where is the Weather Effect?

NBER Working Paper No. 9465
January 2003
JEL No. G12, G14
ABSTRACT
Saunders (1993) and Hirshleifer and Shumway (2001) document the effect of weather on
stock returns. The proposed explanation in both papers is that investor mood affects cognitive
processes and trading decisions. In this paper, we use a database of individual investor accounts to
examine the weather effects on traders. Our analysis of the trading activity in five major U.S. cities
over a six-year period finds vistually no difference in individuals propensity to buy or sell equities
on cloudy days as opposed to sunny days. If the association between cloud cover and stock returns
documented for New York and other world cities is indeed caused by investor mood swings, our
findings suggest that researchers should focus on the attitudes of market-makers, news providers or
other agents physically located in the city hosting the exchange. NYSE spreads widen on cloudy
days. When we control for this, the significance of the weather effect is dramatically reduced. We
interpret this as evidence that the behavior of market-makers, rather than individual investors, may
be responsible for the relation between returns and weather.

Some of the most interesting empirical evidence in behavioral finance is the
recent documentation of astronomical and weather effects on stock market returns.
Saunders (1993) shows that the NYSE rises more on sunny days in New York City.
Hirshleifer and Shumway (2001) replicate Saunders’ study out of sample and extend it to
the major stock markets around the world. Dichev and James (2001) and Yuan, et al.
(2001) both find that investors are affected by lunar cycles. While these effects might at
first seem implausible, researchers cite convincing evidence from the psychology
literature that the weather and the moon can affect human emotions. If stock prices are
driven by investor actions based upon mood rather than upon reason, it suggests two
things about the price formation process. First, that mood affects individual investment
decisions, and second, and more importantly, mood affects actions of the marginal
investor, i.e. the investor setting prices. While it is not difficult to believe that emotion
plays a role in the individual decision-making process, it is striking, in light of the
efficient market theory, that valuation by rational investors does not compensate for the
irrationality of others. If the marginal investor is one whose outlook for the stock market
depends on the weather or the phases of the moon, then the market is plainly not efficient
– or else frictions and other factors prevent the profitable exploitation of irrational
behavior.
The possibility that the weather is salient in the price formation process actually
affords the opportunity to explore whether investors in any specific part of the country
are the price-setters. The implicit assumption in both Saunders (1993) and Hirshleifer and
Shumway (2001) is that the marginal investors are in New York City, or the city in which
the exchange is located. While this may be plausible for some countries with few large

1

cities, or one financial center, the individual and institutional ownership of stocks in the
United States is geographically dispersed. In this paper, we use a panel database of
individual investor accounts that is coded geographically to investigate the basis for the
weather effect. We confirm the findings of Saunders (1993) and Hirshleifer and
Shumway (2001) for New York weather. On the other hand, our analysis of the trading
activity in five major cities (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and
Philadelphia) over a six-year period finds virtually no difference in the propensity to buy
or sell equities on cloudy days as opposed to sunny days. We also show that in our
sample investors’ net fund flow into individual equities is only weakly related to the S&P
500 index, which indicates that investor trading in individual securities does not
significantly impact asset prices in our sample. If the association between cloud cover
and stock returns documented for New York and other world cities is indeed caused by
mood swings, our findings suggest that researchers should focus on the attitudes and riskaversion of market-makers, news providers or other agents physically located in the city
hosting the exchange.
Our dataset contains trades of individuals not institutions. Thus there is the
possibility that institutional traders are emotionally affected by the weather, while
individuals are not. If this were true, it would contradict most assumptions about the
relative sophistication of these two groups. Ruling out individual traders and institutional
traders are the source of the weather effect leaves us with one other set of candidates for a
behavioral explanation for the association between weather and returns: market-makers.
NYSE market making is not a fully competitive mechanism. Thus, when spreads widen,

2

no short-term competitive mechanism exists to tighten them up. Thus, we might expect to
see persistent, behavioral-based anomalies in this setting.
To investigate whether market-maker behavior might be the source of the weather
effect, we examine the relationship between liquidity and weather. We find that the
change in the average daily bid-ask spread for the NYSE stocks in the S&P 100 over the
period of our study widens on cloudy days and narrows on sunny days. The weather
effect on returns becomes insignificant after we control for weather-related liquidity
changes. One potential explanation is that on cloudy days, market makers become less
active or more risk-averse, and that this, in turn, affects market prices.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the data and outlines the
methodology; Section 3 shows that individual propensity to buy stocks is not influenced
by local weather; Section 4 establishes the correlation between individual fund flow into
different asset classes and the NYSE index returns; Section 5 documents how market
liquidity changes are influenced by local weather, and can in part explain the weather
effect; and Section 6 concludes.

2. Data and methodology
Our investor trading record extends from January, 1991 to November, 1996 and is
obtained from a large U.S. discount brokerage firm. Our data contains information on
anonymous investor characteristics, trade date, securities identification, trade quantity,
and price. Investor location is determined by the home zip code provided in a file on key
investor characteristics from the same source. We present a summary of trade and
investor characteristic data in Table 1. We focus in this study on investors living in five
large U.S. metropolitan areas. These five metropolitans are New York, Los Angeles, San
3

Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia. These five cities have a total population of more
than 20 million, which offers a good representation of U.S. urban residents. Our sample
also constitutes about 40 percent of all our individual trade records in the entire database,
making it a fair sample of national individual investors. Another advantage of our sample
is that it includes cities from the eastern and western U.S, which have quite different
weather patterns.
The weather data is obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce (www.noaa.gov) and contains hourly
weather condition of 221 stations throughout the U.S. between 1990 and 1995. The data
contains hourly readings of the Total Sky Cover (SKC), which is defined as the total
amount of sky dome (in tenths) covered by clouds. SKC ranges from 0 (none of the sky is
covered by clouds) to 10 (all of the sky is covered by clouds).
We calculate the daily sky cover in a manner similar to Hirshleifer and Shumway
(2002). We first compute the daily Total Sky Cover (SKC) of each city by taking the
average SKC of each day’s trading hours.1 Since there are seasonal weather patterns, we
compute the SKC of each month as the average of SKC of all days during the month. We
then compute the average SKC for each month of the year (January through December)
as averages of the 6 observations on SKC for that particular month of the year during our
6-year sample. We present the seasonal pattern of SKC for these cities in Figure 1.
Finally, we compute the daily seasonally-adjusted SKC (SASKC) as the SKC of a
particular day minus the SKC of the month to which it belongs (All SKC hereafter is
season-adjusted SKC (SASKC)). This generates a measurement of a particular day’s
1

We also compute the daily SKC as average of SKC of all 24 hours of every day. The correlation
coefficient between these two measures is greater than 0.9. We do not report the results for this daily SKC
measure in our study.

4

weather relative to the average seasonal weather, which captures the “unexpected”
component of that day’s weather change.
We measure the individual tendency to buy relative to sell in both shares and
volume. The net buy in shares (NBS) of a particular day is defined as the total number of
shares of stocks bought minus the total number of shares of stocks sold by our sample
individuals on that day. Positive/negative NBS means that local individuals are net
buyers/sellers during a particular day. We compute a city’s NBS as above for all trades
made by investors from that city.
Similar to Hong and Kumar (2002) and Zhu (2002), we define the buy-sell
imbalance (BSI) in dollar value as the dollar value of the buying trades minus the selling
trades, relative to the daily average of total value of stocks traded by sample investors.
Positive/negative BSI means individuals are net buyers/sellers during a particular day. In
particular, buy-sell imbalance (BSI) is defined as:
BSI it =

VBit - VS it
ADTVi

(1)

where
VBit = Dollar value of all stocks purchased during day t by investors from city i;
VS it = Dollar value of all stocks sold during day t by investors from city i;

ADTVi, = Daily average dollar value of buying and selling trades made by
investors from city i.

3. Weather and individual investment
Regression of NYSE index return on SKC of New York City
We first explore whether the weather effect documented in previous studies
obtains for our 1991 to 1995 sample period. Saunders (1993) shows that the relationship
between stock market return and Wall Street weather weakened in the second half of his
study period. We also have a shorter period than previous studies, which may also bias
against our finding the weather effect.

Similar to Saunders (1993), we also regress

NYSE index daily return on New York City’s sky cover (SKC). In addition, we also
include the one-day lag NYSE index return, a Monday dummy and a January dummy to
control for price movement persistence, the Monday effect, and the January effect.
In Table 2, the coefficient for total sky cover (SKC) is negative and significant at
the 1 percent level. We thus confirm previous findings that the stock return is indeed
higher in sunny days and that these results are robust to the period of study. Consistent
with previous studies, the NYSE index return is weakly higher on Monday. The
coefficients for all other variables are insignificant and the regression R-square is only 1
percent. Having shown that the weather effect is significant during our sample period,
we next investigate whether individual investor behavior is responsible for the
phenomenon.

Weather and individuals’ propensity to buy
We first present the descriptive statistics for NBS on cloudy and sunny days for
the five cities in Table 3. We define cloudy days as those on which SKC is positive
(when more sky dome is covered by clouds than the monthly average) and sunny days as

6

those on which SKC is negative (when less sky dome is covered by clouds than the
monthly average). For the 5 studied cities, there are a total of 4,274 sunny days and 4,726
cloudy days.
The null hypothesis, that the net buy in shares (NBS) on sunny and cloudy days is
equal, cannot be rejected for any of the five cities or for the pooled data. We also report
the results of the univariate regression of NBS on SKC in Table 4. No SKC coefficient is
significant and the explanatory power of all regressions is close to zero. Weather does not
have a significant impact on our sample of investors’ decision to buy or sell stocks.
The results are similar for the buy-sell imbalance (BSI) in dollar value. In Table 5,
the BSI on sunny days is no different than on cloudy days for four out of the five cities -the BSI during sunny days is weakly larger for Philadelphia.
We next perform a univariate regression of BSI on SKC and report the results in
Table 6. The coefficients for SKC are insignificant for all 5 cities, which offers additional
evidence that total sky cover does not influence individual investors’ decisions to buy or
sell stocks. How about differences between sunny and cloudy cities in general? We take
Philadelphia, Miami, and Portland as proxies for moderate, mostly sunny and mostly
cloudy weather, respectively. We present the seasonal weather patterns for these three
cities in Figure 2. The results in Table 7 show that investors from cities with mostly
sunny days, do not tend to make more purchases relative to sales in general, or on sunny
days in particular. Again, we find little association between weather and individual
investment decisions.

7

Weather and local trading volume
Another way that weather could potentially influence the stock market is through
trading volume. Lee and Swaminathan (1998) find a relationship between trading volume
and the momentum effect. Chordia et al. (2001) use trading volume as a proxy for market
liquidity and find changes in trading volume are negatively correlated with market
returns. If the behavioral assumptions suggested in Hirshleifer and Shumway (2002)
indeed hold, the trading volume by individual investors could be significantly different
on sunny days vs. cloudy days.
Our empirical results, however, do not support this hypothesis. We compare the
total dollar value of trades made by our sample individuals during sunny and cloudy days
for the five cities and report the result in Table 8. The trading volume during sunny days
is not significantly greater than during cloudy days for all five cities. For Chicago the
trading volume in sunny days is actually significantly smaller than that during cloudy
days, which offers direct counter evidence that individuals trade more on sunny days.
We further perform a univariate regression analysis of total trading volume in
dollars (TTV) on SKC in Table 9. The results are consistent with Table 8: with the
exception of Los Angeles, the coefficient for SKC is insignificant. The R-squares of these
regressions are extremely low, indicating that weather has little explanatory power for
variations in the total dollar value of trades.

4. Individual investor investment flow and market performance
Another assumption implicit in Saunders (1993) and Hirshleifer and Shumway
(2002) is that it is the marginal investors, the investors setting the prices, who are likely

8

to be influenced by exchange weather. To examine this assumption, we next consider the
evidence in our sample on the question of whether the aggregate fund flow of individual
investors can move aggregate stock prices (c.f. Goetzmann and Massa, 2001). In
particular, we divide our data into fund flow into individual securities, equity mutual
funds and bond mutual funds (no individual security fixed income flow is available). Our
sample contains a total of 1,851,131 trades on common stocks, 223,282 on equity funds
and 40,565 on bond funds. For each asset class, we implement the buy-sell imbalance
measure described in Equation (1).
For each asset class, we regress the daily NYSE index return on fund flow, oneday lagged fund flow, and the lagged NYSE index. We report the results in Table 10. For
flow into common stocks, the order imbalance coefficient is negative and significant at
the 1 percent level. The coefficient on one-day lagged fund flow is positive and
significant at the 10 percent level, suggesting that some impact of individual order flow is
temporary and reversed the next day. Although previous studies using similar data (Hong
and Kumar, 2002; Zhu, 2002) find that individuals tend to be contrarians around events
such as analyst recommendation changes and earnings announcements, it is still
somewhat surprising that individual fund flow into the equity market is strongly
negatively related to equity market return.
One trading mechanism could potentially explain this contrarian finding. Since
individuals make infrequent trades in our sample, it is possible that the negative relation
we observe is due to “stale” limit orders, that is limit orders that individuals have made
but are not careful enough to cancel.2 When there are sharp increases in stock prices,
limit orders to sell are triggered and vice versa, which could conceivably lead to the
2

9

observed contrarian pattern. We perform a simple test to control for potential limit orders.
We argue that limit orders are more likely to take place at round dollars or half dollars.
The rationale is that, compared to market orders, investors are more likely to use
rounding when setting limit orders, which is easier for them to conceptualize.
Presumably, it is difficult to be extraordinarily precise about absolute security valuation.
We therefore exclude all equity trades made at round dollar prices or half dollar prices
and re-run the analysis. The coefficients for order imbalance and lagged order imbalance
are still negative but much smaller in magnitude and insignificant, confirming our
conjecture. Therefore, we conclude that the link between individuals’ flow into common
stocks and overall stock market return for non-limit orders is weak.
For equity mutual funds, the pattern is quite the opposite. The coefficient for the
equity fund order imbalance is positive and significant at the 1 percent level. This
provides some support for the Brown et al. (2002) argument that daily mutual fund flows
may proxy for investor sentiment. The contrast between individuals flow into equities vs.
equity funds suggest that individual trading based on beliefs about the market per se can
have a market impact. For particular stocks, however, individual trades based on securityspecific information have no apparent net effect, and on balance, orders based on security
valuation are effectively contrarian on days when the market moves significantly.
Is the mutual fund flow influenced by weather? Again, we compare the buy-sell
imbalance in equity funds for investors from the five cities. The results in Table 11 and
12 show that the net flow into equity funds is not influenced by local weather, either. The
NBS and BSI of equity funds are not significantly greater on sunny than cloudy days in
all of the five cities, which re-confirms our finding that individual trading is not

10

influenced by local weather. Weather and flow are unrelated, and this is not due to the
confounding effects of stale limit orders. The coefficient for bond fund flow is positive
but insignificant, indicating that individual investors’ bond flow has little impact on the
stock market or vice versa. The R-square for all 4 specifications is low.

5 Weather and market maker behavior
Thus far, we have established that individuals do not have stronger tendency to
buy on sunny days. We have also shown that trading in individual equities do not have a
significant impact on aggregate asset prices. Even New York City investors are not
influenced by New York weather. Therefore, we turn to other market participants for an
explanation of the weather effect.
As we argue above, institutions are unlikely candidates for two reasons. First,
they are typically assumed to be more sophisticated and less susceptible to behavioral
biases than individuals. The findings of Grinblatt and Keloharju (2000) and Shapira and
Venezia (2001) suggest that fund manager trading decisions are less irrational than the
decisions of individuals. Also, like individual investors, institutional investors are located
across the entire country, so that they should also be less influenced by the local weather
of New York City.
Market makers located at the New York Stock Exchange might, on the other
hand, be influenced by the weather there. There is little doubt that market makers can
have a potentially critical impact on stock market prices. Also, since market markers do
not work in a fully competitive environment, there is the possibility that they can deviate
from rational behavior. One important way that market makers can influence the stock

11

market is through the bid-ask spread, which is the most widely-used measure of market
liquidity. Recent research also suggests that liquidity, as measured by the bid-ask spread,
is priced. For example, Chordia et al, (2001) show with comprehensive trade and quote
(TAQ) data that returns are negatively related to changes in liquidity.
If market-maker behavior is the mechanism by which weather changes influence
stock returns, we presumably should detect this in changes in liquidity. Our test is
straightforward: we examine the daily relation between the average bid-ask spread
change and the New York City weather for the period of our sample. Since spreads are
highly serially correlated, we follow Chordia (2002) and examine the change in the
spread rather than the spread itself. We first ask whether the overall market spread
change is associated with total sky cover (SKC). Since no finance theory has suggested
that market liquidity should respond to exchange weather, our null hypothesis is that the
total sky cover (SKC) has no significant influence on market liquidity.
We use Trade and Quote (TAQ) data to compute the daily spread change. We first
compute the daily spread of each of the S&P 100 stocks listed in NYSE. The daily spread
for each stock is computed as the average of all bid-ask spreads within a trading day. We
then compute the market spread as equal-weighted average of the spread of the S&P 100
stocks. We use the equal-weighted instead of value-weighted average, because the equalweighted average of the spread better reflects the average market marker’s behavior.
Since the TAQ data goes back only to 1993, we focus on observations between 1993 and
1995, the last year that we have weather data. Two reasons motivate us to focus on
aggregate market spread. First, since we are interested in exploring the weather effect of
the market index, it serves our purpose perfectly to study the overall market spread. In

12

addition, previous studies (c.f. Easley et al., 2002) have shown that asymmetric
information can play an important role in an individual stock’s liquidity and expected
return. The market makers of particular stocks are concerned about information-based
trades. Asymmetric information should be largely alleviated at the aggregate market
level, which enables us to isolate the relation between spread change and local weather.
We first regress the daily spread change on the sky cover. The results are shown
in specification (1) of Table 13. Surprisingly, the coefficient for SKC is positive and
significant at the 5 percent level, which implies that the spread increases on cloudy days
and decreases on sunny ones. In Specification (2), we include the current index return.
Since the market return is known to be negatively correlated with liquidity changes (c.f.
Chordia et. al., 2001), we must control for it in our analysis of SKC’s impact on spread
change. The coefficient for SKC remains largely unchanged and is still significant at the
5 percent level. Consistent with Chordia et al. (2001), the spread change and the market
return are significantly negatively correlated. We next include the one-day lag of the
NYSE index return and the spread change in specification (3) and the main results
become even stronger. The four independent variables can explain 16 percent of the
variation in the spread change. We also include an interaction term, the product of SKC
and NYSE index return, to control for the fact that market returns are higher on sunny
days. Our main findings still hold. Finally, we include Monday and January dummy
variables to examine whether spread change varies during a particular day of week or
month of year. Both coefficients are negative and insignificant, indicating limited
Monday and January effect on spread change during our sample.

13

We next examine whether systematic shifts in the spread change on sunny vs.
cloudy days can explain the weather effect. We first regress the market return on the total
sky cover (SKC) of New York between 1993 and 1995 in (1) of Table 14. The coefficient
for SKC is negative and significant at the 5 percent level. This confirms all previous
findings of the weather effect with our data. We then include the lagged return in
specification (2) and the coefficient for SKC is negative and still significant. Consistent
with short-term price momentum, the coefficient for lagged return is positive and
significant at the 1 percent level.
In specifications (3) and (4), we add market liquidity changes and the product of
market liquidity changes and total sky cover (SKC). Since we have found that the spread
widens on cloudy days, we suspect that it is partly responsible for lower market returns
on cloudy days. In both specifications, the coefficients of SKC become much smaller and
less significant than they were in specification (1) and (2). For specification (4), the
coefficient of SKC becomes insignificant. This confirms our hypothesis that spread
change, which itself may be affected by exchange local weather, in part drives the
weather effect on returns documented in the literature. The coefficient for DQSP is
negative and significant at the 1 percent level, indicating that the spread change, at least
in part, explains the weather effect.

Conclusion
In this paper we take a deeper look at the weather effect documented in Saunders
(1993) and Hirshleifer and Shumway (2001). Contrary to expectations, it does not seem
to be driven by weather-induced mood swings of individual investors. However the

14

effect is plainly there in the data. We consider another potentially interesting behavioral
mechanism for the result: weather-induced changes in the risk-aversion of the NYSE
specialist. We document a significant relation between liquidity as measured by bid-ask
spread, and the cloud cover in New York City. When included as an explanatory variable
in a regression of returns on weather, the previously documented weather effect is greatly
reduced. Following previous researchers, we conjecture that the association between
weather and liquidity may be due to weather-induced mood swings. However, rational
explanations for such behavior are also possible. It is plainly not a “vacation” effect in
which market makers take off early on sunny days, because that would lead to a
relationship of opposite sign. Perhaps, instead market-makers are more apt to depart the
city early to beat the rush out of town on rainy days. In any case, whether the relationship
we identify is due to market-maker irrationality or is simply a rational response to the
information-generating process – or even New York City traffic – is a matter for further
conjecture.

Table 3 Mean of Net Buy in Share (NBS) for Sunny and Cloudy Days
