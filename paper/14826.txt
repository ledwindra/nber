Financial Instability, Reserves, and Central Bank Swap Lines in the Panic of 2008

NBER Working Paper No. 14826
March 2009

ABSTRACT
In this paper we connect the events of the last twelve months, "The Panic of 2008" as it has been called,
to the demand for international reserves. In previous work, we have shown that international reserve
demand can be rationalized by a central bank’s desire to backstop the broad money supply to avert
the possibility of an internal/external double drain (a bank run combined with capital flight). Thus,
simply looking at trade or short-term debt as motivations for reserve holdings is insufficient; one must
also consider the size of the banking system (M2). Here, we show that a country’s reserve holdings
just before the current crisis, relative to their predicted holdings based on these financial motives, can
significantly predict exchange rate movements of both emerging and advanced countries in 2008. Countries
with large war chests did not depreciate -- and some appreciated. Meanwhile, those who held insufficient
reserves based on our metric were likely to depreciate. Current account balances and short-term debt
levels are not statistically significant predictors of depreciation once reserve levels are taken into account.
Our model’s typically high predicted reserve levels provide important context for the unprecedented
U.S. dollar swap lines recently provided to many countries by the Federal Reserve.

For nearly two decades, the group of emerging-market countries increased its holdings of
liquid foreign exchange reserves, both in dollar terms and relative to domestic income
levels. That trend accelerated in the early 2000s, but it may be ending now as the
emerging economies struggle in the backwash of the global financial crisis and economic
slowdown. In the mid-2000s, liquidity was abundant in the world economy, but recently
there has been an acute global shortage of dollar liquidity. Recent declines in emerging
market international reserves are directly related to this shortage.
Figure 1 illustrates reserve developments for three large emerging economies, the
Russian Federation, India, and Korea. All three countries’ reserve levels peaked and then
began to decline in the summer of 2008. In particular, Russia’s huge reserve holdings—
second in dollar terms only to those of China and Japan—have plummeted by about a
quarter since reaching their oil-driven peak in July 2008.1 There are many other examples
beyond the three especially dramatic ones in Figure 1; often, however, the percentage
reserve losses are smaller (so far) and start later (for example, after the September 2008
Lehman Brothers collapse). The Russian, Indian, and Korean currencies have all
depreciated against the United States dollar since the summer of 2008, with Korea’s won
declining most dramatically to levels not seen since the Asian crisis of the late 1990s.
Before the recent crisis, commentary on the emerging-market reserve buildup
focused on the possibility that reserve stocks might have reached “excessive” levels.
Certainly some countries’ reserve levels far exceeded the levels needed to counter
fluctuations in export earnings, and often even covered the possibility that short-term
1

The Russian situation was exacerbated by noneconomic fundamentals (political risk), most notably
following the invasion of Georgia in August 2008. The Russian data are also obfuscated by occasional
replenishments of the central bank’s reserves by drawing from the country’s Sovereign Wealth Fund. The
fungibility of central bank and SWF assets, and the rapidly growing size of SWF hoards, will likely
complicate measurement even further in future.

external debts might not be rolled over (the so-called “Guidotti-Greenspan” prescription
for reserve adequacy). Economic analysis of optimal reserve levels has a long history,
going back at least to the writing of Henry Thornton (1939) at the start of the nineteenth
century. In recent work, we have followed Thornton’s lead, arguing that governments—
especially those of emerging markets—view reserves as protection against “doubledrain” crisis scenarios in which banking and currency problems interact in ways likely to
cause sharp and disruptive external currency depreciation.2
In a specific crisis scenario, investor fear of currency depreciation leads to a run
out of domestic deposits, pressuring banks and triggering lender-of-last resort liquidity
(LLR) provision by the monetary authorities. This LLR support, however, magnifies the
potential claims on official foreign exchange reserves, and hence magnifies the currency
depreciation that results when the reserves are expended to support the exchange rate. It
follows that reserve levels may have to be quite large if the banking system is highly
developed and the government hopes to resist sharp currency depreciation in a potential
crisis. Official fear of abrupt depreciation may be due to dollarized financial liabilities,
rapid pass-through to inflation, or other factors discussed in the “fear of floating”
literature.
The utility of foreign exchange reserves is well articulated by the International
Monetary Fund (2008, p. 37) in a recent overview of the current crisis: “[I]n the face of
sharp capital outflows, countries will need to respond quickly to ensure adequate liquidity
and deal with emerging problems in weaker institutions. The exchange rate should be

discussed in the crisis literature, for example by Guillermo A. Calvo (1996, 2006), Calvo and Enrique G.
Mendoza (1996), Roberto Chang and Andrés Velasco (2001), Jeffrey D. Sachs (1998), and Velasco (1987).

allowed to absorb some of the pressure, but stockpiles of reserves provide room for
intervention to avoid disorderly market conditions.”

I. Financial Stability and Reserves in the Data
In Obstfeld et al. (2008) we argue that a considerable share of the reserve accumulation in
recent years can be explained as an attempt by central banks to insure against this sort of
financial instability. Importantly, the financial shock we consider is not simply a “sudden
stop”, in which case countries would need to hold reserves only in proportion to their
short term external debt. Rather, internal sources of financial instability also can be
critical. As a result, when a country has open financial markets and desires exchange rate
stability, it needs to hold reserves proportional to the size of its banking system.
Specifically, we show that the reserves/GDP ratio is a function of financial
openness, the exchange rate regime and monetary depth (M2/GDP ratio). Despite the
focus on the “Guidotti-Greenspan” rule and sudden stops in the literature, short term
external debt is not a significant predictor of reserve holdings, though another variable
often considered in more traditional models, the Trade/GDP ratio is.3 Thus, a
specification like that in Table 1, Column 1, which combines our basic “financial
stability” variables with Trade/GDP does a good job of explaining reserve behavior.4 We

3

For a review of the recent empirical literature, see Obstfeld et al (2008). Robert Flood and Nancy Marion
(2002) have connected reserve holdings to a buffer stock model, Joshua Aizenman and Marion (2003) have
argued the buildup of reserves in East Asia can be seen as precautionary savings, and Aizenman and
Jaewoo Lee (2007) argue that precautionary not mercantilist reasons can explain the reserves buildup.
Relative to these papers, we focus more on the size of the domestic financial system as opposed to fear of
sudden stops.

The model is estimated in natural logs and standard errors are clustered at the country level to correct for
both heteroskedasticity across countries and serial correlation within countries. We use WDI data for
reserves, GDP, and M2. The Financial openness measure is from Edwards (2007), the exchange rate
classification is based on Shambaugh (2004), and the measure of “original sin” is from Barry Eichengreen
et al. (2005) and is based on BIS issuance data. See Obstfeld et al. (2008) for details on data and sample.

see that the coefficients on financial openness, monetary depth, and trade all have
expected signs and are significantly different from zero at 99%. A “soft peg” measure is
also positive and significant at 99% while a direct peg is not (though the two are not
statistically significantly different). The regressions are in logs, so a 10% increase in the
M2/GDP ratio is correlated with a 3% increase in the reserves to GDP ratio. Financial
openness is scaled between 0 and 1 (based on the measure proposed by Sebastian
Edwards 2007) and the exchange-rate regime variables are dummies.
In the Emerging Market sample (EM), where much of the puzzle over recent
behavior lies, a specification like this explains a substantial portion of reserve/GDP
variation, both over time for one country (in panel estimations with country fixed effects)
and across countries (in cross-sections or in panels with year fixed effects). Column 2
shows the basic EM sample regression. The coefficients on financial openness and
monetary depth are even larger, as is the explanatory power of the regression. The R2 is
now as high as 0.6. Differences in exchange rate regimes are not significant in the EMonly sample.5
Financial depth is even more important in the last 15 years since the expansion of
financial globalization. In Column 3 we show the specification for 1993-2005 for all
countries.6 Here the coefficient on financial depth has increased such that a 10% increase
in M2/GDP comes with a 5% increase in reserves/GDP. The coefficient on trade

5

As we note in our previous work, many of the emerging market countries flip back and forth across
exchange rate regimes and even when not pegging may intend to peg soon. See Michael W. Klein and
Shambaugh (2008).
6
As noted below, we will also include a measure of the ability to issue debt externally in local currency.
This measure is not available until 1993, so we limit ourselves to that sample here. In Obstfeld et al. (2008)
we show that a post 1990 sample that is not limited by “sin” data availability also looks like the regression
shown here.

4

openness has declined some. Financial openness is less significant in this sample. There
is less variation within country in this shorter sample so some precision is lost.
One other factor that is consistently significant is a dummy for the advanced
countries (AD). These countries hold fewer reserves than their M2/GDP, Trade/GDP,
exchange rate regime and financial openness suggest they should. This is true even when
we control for the ability to issue debt in ones’ own currency, or “original sin.” Column 4
shows this regression. The sin variable—which varies from 0 (little foreign currency debt
issued) to 1 (all external debt is in foreign currency, none local) has a significant and
positive coefficient. Going from all local currency debt to all foreign currency debt would
double reserve holdings.7
In this paper, rather than focusing entirely on the EM sample (as in our previous
work) we now include AD countries. While the puzzle of reserve buildup was primarily
an EM issue, the current crisis is one that clearly touches both EM and AD countries.
Thus, in our predictive work below will be limited to that sample, for which column 5
shows the corresponding results for our preferred benchmark regression with only
financial variables.

II. Implications for Today
What can our positive empirical model tell us about reserves, central bank swaps of
foreign currency, and exchange rates during the recent financial panic? We want to know
how actual reserve holdings on the eve of the crisis compare to what our model would
predict, to see if countries were “underinsured” or “overinsured.” Thus, we first generate
7

This variable is largely cross-sectional. There is little variation within countries. Further, there is little
variation across the EM and developing countries. Nearly all issue almost exclusively foreign currency debt
externally. There is, however, cross-country variation within the advanced sample.

predicted values for reserve-to-GDP ratios in 2005. We then adjust those ratios for
M2/GDP changes in the last two years to get approximate predicted values for 2007,
since M2 growth is the main regressor that changes at high frequency in our sample.
(More details are shown in Appendix Table 1.)
For the year 2007, EM countries were predicted to hold substantial reserves;
predicted ratios are quite high (20% of GDP on average) relative to those of AD countries
(9%). Some have accumulated far beyond these levels, especially between 2005 and
2007. By 2007, actual reserves were 26% of GDP on average for these countries.8 For
example, in 2005, China’s predicted reserves were 29% of GDP while actual were 37%.
China held more reserves than expected, but not dramatically so. By 2007, however,
predicted reserves had not moved much but China’s actual reserves were up to 47% of
GDP. Likewise Malaysia, Singapore, and Korea were all predicted to have reserves of
20% of GDP or more, but actual levels were substantially higher. Also, countries like
Brazil or India who were at or below predicted levels in 2005 were above them by 2007.
The model predicts the variation across these countries reasonably well. The correlation
of predicted and actual reserve/GDP ratios is 0.68.
On the other hand, we can see that many advanced countries held fewer reserves
than our model predicts.9 Australia, the U.K., and Canada are notable examples. What if
we do not think advanced countries should hold fewer reserves than other countries? That
is, what if we run the regression in column 5 without the AD dummy, we see that the
predicted values (based on the large financial sectors and tendency towards financial

Hong Kong and Singapore are both predicted to and do hold far more reserves than other countries.
Excluding them, the predicted reserve ratio for the group is 17% of GDP and the actual is 21%.

Due to a lack of individual country reserve holdings or M2, euro area countries are not included in the
analysis of predicted reserves.

openness) suggest the advanced countries should be holding larger stocks of reserves than
they actually own. In this exercise we also find that Denmark, Sweden, and New Zealand
are holding fewer reserves than the typical country with their characteristics. Only Japan
holds substantially more reserves than the predicted value suggests they would.10
Perhaps some advanced countries held too few reserves? On the other hand, many
of these advanced countries received substantial U.S. dollar swap lines from the Federal
Reserve in 2007 and 2008. Perhaps they knew such types of arrangements would be
available to them in a pinch, so they did not feel the need to hold reserves in the same
pattern as EM countries. In that case, estimation with the AD dummy may be the right
benchmark to examine.11

III. Currency Pressure versus the War Chests in The Panic of 2008
Echoing Thornton, our theoretical model assumes that it is in the event of a panic that
reserves will be used to quell M2 flight and avert depreciation. It is natural to ask whether
this mechanism was at work in 2008: were exchange rates better stabilized in countries
with more reserves relative to M2?—or, to be more faithful to the multivariate model,
with more reserves relative to what the model would have predicted?
Figure 2a addresses the first of these questions with a simple scatter of percentage
depreciation of the currency against the U.S. dollar in the year 2008 [up to 12/15 at time

10

Iceland’s predicted reserves are lower than some other countries because their financial account is coded
as less open than other advanced countries in the Edwards measure. The Chinn-Ito index also codes Iceland
as more closed than other advanced nations.
11
Admittedly, some EM countries (surprisingly) received swap lines from the Fed in 2008. However, the
size of these lines appears small compared to their hypothetical needs in the event that a run from M2
should materialize. Skeptics have therefore argued that these lines may be signals at best, or pure window
dressing. At the time of writing, it is an open question whether they would be expanded, or augmented by
IMF lines or other funding, should disaster strike.

of writing] versus the country’s reserves/M2 ratio at the end of 2007. The sample is
restricted to just the emerging countries, as our regressions suggest that advanced
countries have an intrinsically smaller need for reserves due to, say, more policy
credibility and certainty, or better access to private credit or official swap lines. The
scatter shows that countries with feebler war chests at the end of 2007 suffered larger
currency crashes in 2008, offering preliminary support for our arguments. However,
Table 2, panel (a) explores this relationship further and adds some controls. Column 1
shows that the bivariate relationship is only borderline significant (p value 0.106). In
contrast to arguments regarding the perils of financial openness, Column 2 shows that
currency values of more financially open economies saw their currency values more
likely to hold in 2008, hinting at reverse causality from (more) financial stability to
(more) openness. Column 3 enters openness and reserves together and the results are
similar. Finally, Column 4 entertains another prevalent explanation, namely that
depreciations are really a result of unsustainable current account deficits. But lagged
current account deficit as a share of GDP was not a highly statistically significant
influence in this sample, once we control for the size of the reserve war chest.12
Table 2, panel (b) takes the next step of using not actual 2007 reserves as a
control variable, but the ratio of actual reserves to what our preferred model would have
predicted. We now see whether “underinsurance” (as judged by our positive model) was
associated with larger depreciations in 2008. Indeed it was in all samples once we
exclude an influential extreme outlier—the infamous case of Iceland. In Columns 2

12

We also experimented in both panels of Table 2 with lagged short term debt to GDP ratio as an extra
regressor, to address the claim that rollover problems might exacerbate depreciation, but we found its
coefficient always had the wrong (negative) sign, so that bigger debts appeared to be related to smaller
depreciations, contradicting the theory.

8

through 5, which unlike Column 1 exclude Iceland, the relationship between low reserves
and high depreciation is clear. Actual relative to predicted reserves is significant at the
1% level in the full and AD samples, and the 10% level in the more noisy EM sample. In
Column 6 this result is again robust to the inclusion of the lagged current account surplus
to GDP ratio, which is once more statistically insignificant (though of the expected sign).
As a convenient graphical summary of our argument, we present a scatter plot of actual
depreciation in 2008 versus our model’s actual/predicted reserve ratio for the AD & EM
sample. This is shown in Figure 2b, with Iceland excluded from the line of best fit, as in
Column 2. Excluding the bizarre case of Iceland, the results are quite striking:
international reserves did provide effective insurance against currency instability, for
both advanced and emerging countries alike.

IV. Central Bank Currency Swaps in the Panic of 2008
This crisis has also generated one of the most notable examples of central bank
cooperation in history—the large swap lines set up between a number of central banks.13
The Federal Reserve extended large swap lines to industrial-country central banks first
(ECB, BoJ, BoE, and SNB) starting in 2007; then extended those to nearly every
advanced economy; and finally, on October 29, 2008, granted similar arrangements to
four major emerging market countries (Brazil, Korea, Mexico, and Singapore).14
In these swaps, the Fed has provided dollar liquidity to the other central banks
allowing these central banks, in turn, to provide dollars to their own domestic banking
systems. Why are such swap lines needed? Two alternatives for the provision of dollar
13

liquidity in the foreign country would be (a) for the foreign central bank to provide the
domestic currency and let the bank sell the local currency for dollars on the open market
or (b) for the foreign central bank to use its own dollar reserves to provide the liquidity.
The former would put downward pressure on the local currency and the latter would
possibly exhaust the central bank’s dollar reserves. Examining current reserve holdings
relative to our positive model’s predictions is a useful way to provide some empirical
context for these swap lines.
The size of the swap lines available has varied across countries and for the major
industrial-country central banks eventually became unlimited. The ECB and SNB also
instituted smaller swap lines, in their own currencies, with a number of smaller European
countries.15 In Table 3, for swap recipients, we show actual and predicted reserves/GDP
as well as actual reserves in dollars, the gap in our model between actual to predicted (in
dollars), and the size of the initial swap lines themselves.
The swaps were clearly large in magnitude for many advanced countries. For
every advanced country except Japan, the size of the swap exceeded 50% of actual
reserves held and in the case of the U.K., Australia, and the ECB, the swap was larger
than the existing level of reserves.16 In addition, for a number of countries, such as
Denmark, Sweden, and New Zealand, not only was the swap line nearly as big as existing
reserves, but it was larger than the gap with our model’s prediction. On the other hand, in
some cases, the swap line was too small to plug the gap relative to predicted reserves.

15

See Fender and Gyntelberg (2008) for a discussion of the swap lines. Data for the size of the swaps is
taken from there. Swaps that were eventually increased to infinity are listed in the table at the largest
amount prior to that increase and are noted in the table.
16
Detailed information on reserves on the Bank of England website shows currency composition of
reserves and this reveals that the BoE holdings of US dollars was much smaller than the total reserves and
by the time the swap line was instituted, the BoE was down to less than $10 billion in US dollar reserves.

10

Australia, Canada and the U.K. all still have fewer reserves than expected even counting
the swap (and not counting the decline in their reserves in 2008 so far).
In contrast, the swaps to emerging countries are never larger than 50% of their
actual reserves. Further, in most cases, the country already had more reserves than
predicted. Korea’s was $30 billion, though the country already had $260 billion. For
Singapore the figure was, $30 billion against $162 billion already held, and Brazil
received $30 billion versus $180 billion on hand. It is hard to see how these magnitudes
could be very meaningful; all three countries already held more reserves than predicted
by our model. Instead, these swap lines could be interpreted as signals. For Mexico and
Hungary, the swaps are more substantial relative to actual reserves and those two
countries were holding fewer reserves than predicted, so the swap lines may have had a
more substantive impact beyond mere signaling in those cases.
This way of looking at the swaps demonstrates a number of important issues in
the current international monetary system. Even with nearly a trillion dollars committed,
in some cases the Fed’s action was primarily symbolic because the foreign country
already had so many dollars. In other cases, the swap may have been quite important, but
the scale required to for effective lending is not available to organizations such as the
IMF or other multilateral agencies. Only the world’s largest central banks can intervene
on such a scale. Some players (such as China and India) do have foreign reserves
sufficient to allow them to act as crisis lenders to foreign governments, but so far such
actions have been limited, including Nordic central banks lending euros to Iceland and
Japan’s offer of $100 billion in resources to the IMF.

11

The swap lines also have implications for reserve holdings. One could argue that
the expectation that such swap lines could be available rationalizes advanced countries’
decisions to hold fewer reserves than other countries. This would suggest EM countries
will continue to hold large reserves until they are confident that they will have access to
substantial foreign exchange swaps when in need. Alternatively, these extraordinary
measures may have been just that—extraordinary. The advanced countries may now
recognize this and increase their reserve stocks (or in some cases adopt the euro to
reduce the need for reserves). An increase in IMF resources could also be in the cards.

V. Conclusion
International reserves are in some ways the ultimate rainy day fund for a country. They
are hard, liquid assets that have value in times of need. The Panic of 2008 is more than a
rainy day: it is a torrential downpour. Elsewhere we have argued that reserve holdings are
strongly connected to the size of the banking system. Countries insure not just against an
end of foreign financial inflows, but also against runs on the currency by domestic savers.
Here we show that interpreting reserve holdings in this manner is helpful for
understanding reserve adequacy and countries’ seemingly different abilities to weather
the current storm.
Currencies of countries holding more reserves relative to M2—and in particular,
more reserves relative to our measure of predicted reserves based on financial motives—
have tended to appreciate in the crisis. Those of countries with smaller war chests have
depreciated. Understanding these motives for reserve demand also shows that central
bank swap lines to some smaller advanced countries have been sizable as a share of

12

current and needed reserves. For most EM countries, though, the swaps have been largely
symbolic. The scale of reserves needed to backstop emerging markets simply surpasses
the resources of the multilateral organizations and all but the largest reserves holders in
the world.

Source: WDI data and authors’ calculations. Gap in reserves uses column 3 for the advanced countries, the
higher estimate for reserves needs. Swap line amounts from Fender and Gyntelberg (2008). Swap lines in
italics were eventually uncapped, providing effectively infinite resources if the country chooses to use
them.

Source: WDI data and authors’ calculations. Column 6, actual reserves to predicted reserves uses column 2,
the predicted reserves based on column 5 of table 1 for both the advanced and emerging countries. Using
the higher estimate for reserves needs for AD countries strengthens the results in table 2b.
