    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper uses U.S. credit register data and the 2018\u20132019 Trade War to study the effects of uncertainty on domestic credit supply. Exploiting differences in banks\u2019 ex-ante exposure to trade uncertainty, we find that increased uncertainty is associated with a broad lending contraction across their customer firms. This result is consistent with banks responding to uncertainty with wait-and-see behaviors, where more exposed banks curtail risky exposures, reduce loan maturities, and adjust loan supply along both intensive and extensive margins. The lending contraction is larger for more capital-constrained banks and has significant real effects, especially for bank-dependent firms.\n\n",
