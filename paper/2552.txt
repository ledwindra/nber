The collapse of the money-income relationship in the l9BOs has thrown into
question long-standing presumptions about the appropriate conduct of monetary
policy.

Before the l980s economists and policymakers had long debated the role

that aggregate measures of money (or credit) should
play in the monetary policy
process.

Although issues of a non-empirical nature were also important in this

regard --

for

example, the desire for a system under which policymakers could be

readily monitored and held accountable

-

- the

central issue was always the

stability and reliability of the money-income relationship.

Those who believed

that it was highly stable typically sought to tie monetary policy more
rigidly to
fixed money growth targets, while those who doubted this stability
sought to base

monetary policy not just on money but on other variables too (credit, for
example), and in any case to make the connection between policy actions and
either money or any other specific variables more flexible.

What was at issue throughout this period, however, was mostly the short-run
conduct of monetary policy, and therefore the short-run
stability of the moneyIncome

relationship:

fluctuations from quarter to quarter, or perhaps even
year

Few economists or policymakers expressed doubts that the
money-income

relationship was highly stable over a time horizon as long as the average
business cycle, and therefore few argued that
money growth qhould not follow a
narrowly specified trend over several years taken together.

For those who were

skeptical that a more activist policy could successfully carry out
countercyclical stabilization anyway, the widely agreed upon stability of the
money-income relationship over longer horizons led naturally to a fixed money

The direction of the change in Ml growth in each of these

periods had foretold the direction of the change in inflation in the next, and on
this basis Friedman predicted, "The increased rate of money growth in the 198183 biennium suggests that we have passed the trough in inflation and that
inflation will be decidedly higher from 1983 to 1985 than it was from 1981-83."
Instead, inflation turned out to be lower during 1983:111-1985:111 than during
1981:111-1983:111, and it was lower still during 1985:111-1987:111 despite

II.

Money and Credit as Information Variables
The breakdown of such simple money-income or money-price relationships casts

doubt on the use of money (or credit) as a target of monetary policy in any
rigid, mechanical sense.

It need not preclude a useful role for such variables

in the monetary policy process, however, as long as their movements provide
information about subsequent fluctuations of income or prices, or any other
outcomes that monetary policy seeks to affect.1

A

policy framework based on

aggregate measures of money (or credit) used as "information variables" is more
flexible, and hence more complicated and harder to monitor externally, than a
framework based on such variables used as policy targets.

The greater the extent

to which the relationships that connect these variables to income and prices are
affected both by other variables (like interest rates) and by stochastic shocks,
however, the greater are the relative merits of an information variable approach
compared to a simpler targeting approach.

In the context of the information variable approsch to monetary policy, the
much debated issue of whether stetistical experiments like these constitute valid
tests

of "causelity" is beside the point.

What matters is simply whether the

movements of some financial quantity convey information about future movements of
income or prices that is not already conteined in observed movements of income or
prices themselves.

If so, then monetery policy can exploit that information by

If so, then monetsry policy csn exploit that information by

systematically reacting to observed movements of these variables, regardless of
whether this information reflects true causation, reverse causation based on
anticipations, or mutual causation by some independent buc unobserved force.
As of 1979, the available evidence strongly supported the view that observed
fluctuations of Ml in the United States did contain such information about future
movements of U.S. income and prices.

By contrast, the same experiments carried

out with data for the mosc recent 18 years provide no supporc for the view that
fluctuations in Ml carry information about future income and prices that is not
already containod in fluctuations of income and prices themselves.

Not one of

the F-statistIcs for this more recent sample is significant at even the .10
level.

Once again, what is true for Ml is also true for other money and credIt

aggregates. The F-statistics for analogous experiments carried out with

142

or

credit in place of Ml show the same pattarm of changing significance as in
Table 2.

Not one of the F-statistics for M2, and not one for credit, is

significant at the .10 level for the 1970:1-1987:11 sample.
Not surprisingly, such findings have prompted a search for ways to 'fix up"
this form of teat of the money-income relationship, just as a much more intensive
search, which began even earlier, has sought to fix up the money demand function.
Stock and Parson (1987), for example, showed that with the right specification
lagged Ml was in fact significant in equations for real income (proxied by
industrial production) in tests based on monthly data for 1960:2-1985:12.

For a

system including money, income, prices and am interest rate, together with a time
trend, they reported an F-statistic of 3.04 (easily significant at the .01 level)
for the null hypothesis that all of the lagged money coeffIcients ware rero.
Kuttner and I have show-n, however, merely extending the sample for this
experiment through 1987:9 reduces the F-statistic to 1.80, just barely

significant at the .10 level (p value .0994), and changes Stock and Watson's
results for the other systems that they investigated as well.
Table 3 shows that the most recent experience has also eliminated
statistical support for the hypothesis that income and money (or credit) are
cointegrated.

The table shows Dickey-Fuller t-statistics for the null hypothesis

of no cointegration between nominal income and each of several financial quantity
variables, in the presence of a possibly nonlinear time trend.4

The results

shown are based on quarterly data for three samples, which here differ only in
their respective end-points:

before the introduction of new monetary policy

procedures, before the abandonment of those procedures, and the latest data
available as of the time of writing.

At least for M2 and credit, the data

through 1979:Ifl warranted rejecting the null hypothesis of no cointagration with

nomna1 income at

the .05 level,

only at the .10 level.

The data through 1982:11 did so as well, albetr

For data through 1987:11, however, there is no evidence

of cointagration with nominal income for any of these financial quantity
variables

III. Questions About Monetary Policy Since 1982

If it is difficult to escape the conclusion that financial quantity
variables have lost their relevance for monetary policy in the 1980s, it is also
difficult to escape the conclusion that the Federal Reserve System has responded
to this development by conducting monetary policy primarily with reference to
short-term nominal interest rates (and, indirectly, dollar exchange rates).

One

reason for drawing this conclusion is simply the return to interest rate
stability after the Federal Reserve "suspended" its Ml target in 1982.

The

standard deviation of the month-to-month change in the three-month U.S. Treasury
bill rate rose from .42% during 1970:1-1979:9 to 1.54% during 1979:10-1982:9, and
than fall to .32% during 1982:10-1987:9.

Another reason is that what movements

in short-term interest rates have occurred since mid-1982 have shown little
apparent connection to fluctuations of the major monetary aggregates

(or credit)

or to deviations of these aggregates from the corresponding official target
ranges.
The success of U.S. monetary policy in macroeconomic terms during these
years notwithstanding, a return to approximately the same monetary framework that
the Federal Reserve employed a quarter-century ago should give cause for sone
concern --

not

least because of the systematic errors that the Federal Resarve

made under that policy.

The extensive analysis of U.S. monetary policy during

the first two decades or so following the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord,
including research carried out at the time as well as subsequently, has
documented three problems in particular.

Each bears renewed consideration now

that the Federal Reserve has returned to what amounts to a policy framework
centered on controlling nominal interest rates.
First, and most obviously, this framework had no nominal quantity to anchor
the price level.

Although inflation was not therefore inevitable, there was

little protectionagainst it when inflationary pressures intensified in the late
l960s and especially in the l970s.

For some years following Sargent ar.d

Wallace's (1975) demonstration that basing monetary policy on nominal interest
rates left the price level indeterminate in a model with "rational" expectations
and perfectly flexible prices, many economists eschewed analysis of such a policy
framework altogether, and concentrated only on policies based on controlling
money.

As McCallum (1981) has shown, however, even in Sargent and Wallace's

model price indeterminacy results only when the central bank takes no account of
prices (or any other nominal variable) in choosing the level at which to set
interest rates.6

Especially in a context that allows for rigidities in price

setting behavior as well as more realistic representations of expectations, no

9
one knows to what extent it is practicslly possible to avoid inflation with a
monetary policy framework based on nominal interest rates, or how best to
structure such a policy to achieve that end.
Second, once inflation did emerge. Federal Reserve officials

(and nany other

people too) often failed to distinguish nominal from real interest rates.

As a

result, they often associated higher observed interest rates with a tighter
policy stance even when the increase in nomInal interest rates nerely kept pace
with, or even fell short of, rising inflation expectations.

In light of the

enormous attention subsequently devoted to the distInctIon between nominal and
real interest rates, both

would be surprising

literature and at the popular level,

i.t

see thIs mistake repeated in such an obvious way.

Nevertheless, inferring "the reel Interest rate" is hardly straightforward.
Expectations of futore Inflation are unobservable, end different people nay hold
dIfferent expectatIons anyway.

Different people and different institutions also

face different tax rates.
Third, there is also substantial evidence that, when U.S. monetary polIcy

relied primarily or noninal interest rates in the past, Federal Reserve officIals
systenatically confused the level of Interest rates as the operating instrument
7
of policy with the level of interest rates as an ultimate obertiva of policy.

As a result, they usually delayed too long before raising or lowering interest
rate levels, and even then made changes of insufficient nsgnltude.

Although this

error too baa received enormous attention, nore In the research literature than

in popular discussions, no one knows whether it ia now possible to design a
nonetary policy framework based prinarily on interact ratea that can provide
adequate safeguards against repeating ft.
datail what such safeguards might be.

The evidence from recent experience is clear on the potential role of
financial quantity variables in the monetary policy process, and it is not
positive.

Perhaps the time has come for economists to turn at least some of the

effort they are now spending on trying to overturn the evidence on these
variables toward thinking about how best to conduct nonetary policy without them.
