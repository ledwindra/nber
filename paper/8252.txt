I.     Introduction


       What is the role of minority preferences in a democratic society? Few questions

in political economy resonate as deeply as this one. Interestingly, the two most important

concerns over minority preferences are diametrically opposed. On the one hand,

minorities are seen as powerless. The “tyranny of the majority” has long been considered

to be one of “the evils against which society requires to be on its guard” (Mill, 1859).

Based on this concern, the Framers of the U.S. constitution sought to design democratic

institutions that would render “the majority … unable to concert and carry into effect

schemes of oppression” (Madison, 1788). In contrast to the view that democracy would

leave minorities powerless, there is the fear, prominently expressed in Madison’s

discussion of factions, that small, but highly motivated groups might highjack the

democratic process and exert undue influence. The superior ability of small groups to

solve problems of collective action is one basis for the view that minorities are not

powerless but, relative to their size, all too influential in democratic decision-making

(Olson, 1971).


       In this paper, we address the question of minority influence by examining how

electoral participation varies with the size of groups of citizens. Turnout is of interest not

only because electoral participation is often seen as a basic democratic ideal (Lijphart,

1997). Turnout also matters because changes in the composition of the electorate lead to

systematic changes in policy (Husted and Kenny, 1997; Lott and Kenny, 1999).

Moreover, turnout among blacks, the focus of this paper, is of particular relevance in

view of the ongoing debate about majority-minority districts in the United States. Based



                                              1
on the 1965 Voting Rights Act and its 1982 amendment, at-large elections can be illegal

if they have the effect of reducing the opportunity for minority voters to elect

representatives of their choice. This has led to the creation of numerous single-member

districts, many of which have a supermajority of black citizens. Courts and voting rights

lawyers favor districts that are 65% black because they believe that this fraction is needed

to guarantee that black voters constitute a majority of those going to the polls (Briffault,

1995).


         Majority-minority districts have been criticized both on grounds of efficacy as

well as for constitutional reasons.1 While there is little doubt that these districts increase

the number of black representatives, it is less obvious that they truly further the interests

of the minority. As black voters become increasingly concentrated in a few districts,

representatives of mostly white districts may grow less sensitive to minority issues. On

balance, there appears to be a positive correlation between the number of majority-

minority seats and the likelihood of electoral success for Republican candidates (Brace,

Grofman and Handley, 1987; Hill, 1995; Lublin, 1997). Simulation studies conclude that

minority interests would be best served if blacks made up between 45% and 47% of the

voting age population (Cameron, Epstein and O'Halloran, 1996; Epstein and O'Halloran,

1999).


         The prevailing, if often implicit, view in much of this literature is that the size of

groups influences election outcomes by changing the identity of a district’s median

1
 The Supreme Court overturned several decisions to create majority-minority districts, arguing that the use
of race as the key factor in drawing new district lines violates the constitutional rights of white voters (see,




                                                       2
citizen. If electoral participation were constant, changes in the identity of the median

citizen would lead to corresponding changes in the identity of the median voter. The

evidence presented here documents that this view systematically underestimates the

electoral impact of the size of groups. We show that citizens are more likely to

participate in elections if they live in a jurisdiction with a higher concentration of persons

sharing similar political preferences. Consequently, increases in the number of black

citizens in a district make other blacks in the district more likely to vote, and they make

non-blacks less likely to participate in the election. Our main result is that changes in the

identity of the median citizen lead to even larger changes in the identity of the median

voter, a phenomenon we term electoral acceleration. As a result of these participatory

effects, “moving” black citizens from one district to another helps blacks in the new

district, and hurts blacks in the old jurisdiction. With electoral acceleration, these effects

are larger than changes in the median citizen would lead us to expect.


        While the main contribution of this study is our empirical documentation that

electoral acceleration occurs, we also offer empirical evidence on why it operates. It is

well known that candidates can increase political participation by campaigning to groups

of citizens (Wielhouwer and Lockerbie, 1994). Most channels of communication used to

disseminate campaign information – newspapers, radio and TV stations – exist

independent of the campaign season. The supply of these channels typically carries

considerable fixed cost, which can only be overcome if demand is sufficiently strong.

Candidates thus find more channels of communication for larger than for smaller groups.


e.g., Shaw v. Reno 509 U.S. 630 (1993) in the case of Florida; Bush v. Vera 000 U.S. 94-805 (1996) for
Texas).


                                                    3
For instance, radio stations or newspapers targeting a black audience only exist in places

with many blacks (Waldfogel, 1999). Where such newspapers do not exist, candidates

find it more difficult to reach black citizens. Ultimately, such variation in the relative

price of communicating with different groups appears to be translated into variation in

voting tendencies for these groups. Larger groups are more likely to be campaigned to

and are thus more likely to turn out.


       Electoral acceleration has important implications for a number of questions in

political economy. Following Olson (1971) and Becker (1983), there has been much

interest in instances where small groups have a disproportionately large influence on

policy outcomes. Electoral acceleration provides an example for a mechanism which puts

small groups at a disadvantage. While the ability to solve problems of collective action

undoubtedly contributes to a group’s political effectiveness, our findings highlight the

importance of other determinants of political influence which run counter to the intuition

that small groups generally enjoy a relative competitive advantage.


       Political participation and membership in groups are also the subject of a more

recent debate on the importance of social capital (Putnam, 1993). Indicators for social

capital such as turnout rates, civic engagement and trust appear to be related to

measurable economic performance (Knack and Keefer, 1997). Several papers document

that race has a profound impact on levels of social capital. For instance, racial

heterogeneity decreases the level of trustworthiness in groups (Glaeser, Laibson,

Scheinkman and Soutter, 2000), and individuals living in more racially heterogeneous

communities are less likely to be members of churches and clubs (Alesina and La Ferrara,



                                              4
2000). It appears plausible to expect that greater social interaction is likely to lead to

increases in turnout. Social organizations such as unions and churches facilitate the

dissemination of political information, and face-to-face interaction appears to be

particularly effective in increasing turnout rates (Gerber and Green, 2000b). If correct,

this type of reasoning suggests that racially more heterogeneous communities will have

lower turnout rates both among blacks and whites because members of both groups

become less likely to be socially active as racial fragmentation increases. The present

paper contributes to the discussion of race and social capital by documenting that black

citizens are more likely to turn out if they represent a larger fraction of the population. As

blacks constitute a minority in most counties and in all states, increases in their

population share are synonymous with increases in racial fragmentation. While racial

heterogeneity may be responsible for low levels of trustworthiness and membership in

associations, the relationship between racial fragmentation and political participation –

another measure of social capital – appears to be more complicated and dominated by

forces which cause members of larger groups to become politically more active.


       The paper proceeds in six sections. Section II discusses the role of

communication in influencing turnout rates. Section III describes the data used in the

study. Section IV presents evidence that political preferences differ between US blacks

and whites. Section V describes the empirical strategy employed in the study and

presents evidence of electoral acceleration. Section VI offers evidence for the mechanism

that we posit. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of our findings.




                                               5
II.      Communication and Participation


         Political economy models of participation generally recognize two reasons why

citizens vote: the prospects of changing the outcome of an election and the utility that

voters get from the act of voting (Downs, 1957; Riker and Ordeshook, 1968). The chief

difficulty of explaining rational turnout in the standard framework is that both decision-

theoretic and game-theoretic reasoning suggest that the probability of being decisive in a

large electorate is essentially zero.2 Thus, the rational model is reduced to stating that

citizens will participate if the direct benefits of voting outweigh the costs of participation.

This tautology is of course only helpful if one can add more structure to the problem.


         In this study, we focus on candidates’ costs of campaigning to different groups of

citizens as one determinant of turnout. We refer to “groups” as sets of citizens who share

similar political preferences. It is well known that campaign efforts increase the

likelihood of participation (a summary of experimental results is given in Gerber and

Green, 2000b; see also Cox and Munger, 1989; Bartels, 1993; Wielhouwer and

Lockerbie, 1994; Shachar and Nalebuff, 1999). One interpretation of the effectiveness of

campaigning is that citizens are reluctant to cast their vote if they feel ill informed

(Palfrey and Poole, 1987).3 For instance, citizens frequently abstain from voting in

obscure races, even in situations where they have already borne the cost of going to the

polls (Matsusaka, 1995). By offering such information, candidates reduce citizens’

2
  In models where the probability of being decisive is determined endogenously, turnout can be substantial
if voters have complete information about the preferences and voting costs of every other voter (Palfrey and
Rosenthal, 1984). However, with less than full information, the only voters that participate in elections are
citizens whose direct utility of voting outweighs the costs of participation (Palfrey and Rosenthal, 1985).
This result implies that, at least for large electorates, the variation in turnout rates is likely to be explained
by variation in the direct benefits and costs of voting.


                                                        6
overall cost of voting and thus increase the likelihood of participation. Under this

interpretation of the effectiveness of campaign efforts, candidates have an incentive to

target information at likely supporters (for empirical evidence, see, e.g., Huckfeldt and

Sprague, 1992).


         Our main argument is that, under plausible assumptions, candidates can find it

less expensive to campaign to larger groups of citizens. This cost advantage stems from

the fact that a multitude of communication channels – newspapers, TV programs, radio

shows – exists for large groups, while smaller groups are often more difficult to reach.

For instance, it is easier to provide campaign information to Spanish speakers in cities

that have a Spanish language radio station. Whether or not such a media outlet exists

depends largely on the absolute number of persons sharing similar preferences for media

content (Siegelman and Waldfogel, 1998; Waldfogel, 1999).


         In the United States, most voters get their information about policy platforms from

television and newspapers (Strömberg, 1999a).4 This provides candidates with two

principal means of disseminating political information: paid advertisements and efforts to

influence media content. Groups that watch TV and read newspapers are easier to reach

than groups that do not consume such products. Thus, the demand for media content is

an important determinant of the cost of campaigning. In this setting, two mechanisms can

give rise to a positive relationship between group size and turnout.




3
 In addition, non-partisan appeals to civic duty also appear to increase turnout (Gerber and Green, 2000a).
4
 In the most expensive media markets, candidates rely more heavily on direct mail. (Ansolabehere, Gerber
and Snyder, 1999)


                                                     7
        (i) Availability of media outlets: For small groups, the fixed costs of providing a

newspaper or a TV channel, which offer the news and entertainment these groups are

interested in, may be prohibitively high (Spence and Owen, 1977; see also Bresnahan

and Reiss, 1991 for empirical evidence on the relationship between the size of the market

and the number of competing firms). If preferences for media content are correlated with

citizens’ policy preferences, some candidates will find it difficult to reach groups of likely

supporters. For example, blacks and whites prefer different kinds of media content (for

radio, see Waldfogel, 1999; for newspapers, see George and Waldfogel, 2000). In

section IV of this paper, we will also show that blacks have significantly more liberal

political preferences than whites. If some black citizens do not consume media products

because these products do not correspond to their preferences, liberal candidates will find

it more difficult to reach these potential supporters. Thus, we expect turnout among

blacks to be comparatively low in cities with no (or few) black-targeted media outlets.


        (ii) Media content: Even in cases where the minority is too small to warrant the

production of specialized media outlets, the relative size of the minority will influence

media content, minority consumption, and thus the likelihood of participation. Consider

the case of determining the content of a single daily newspaper in a city. A profit-

maximizing paper values readers because advertisers are willing to pay for the right to

send messages to these individuals (for a detailed analysis of optimal levels of advertising

and product variety, see Anderson and Coate, 2000). The aggregate demand for

advertised products depends, among other factors such as income, on the size of groups.

Thus, all else being equal, the paper is better off by printing an article that is of interest to




                                                8
a larger audience (Strömberg, 1999a). Under some circumstances, the paper will provide

minority-targeted content. For instance, if circulation increases at a decreasing rate in the

number of articles that are of interest to the majority, it is possible that the paper will

cover some minority issues. The larger the minority, the more minority-targeted content

will be provided. This, in turn will increase the likelihood that minority citizens read the

daily. This view is consistent with observed empirical regularities. For example, George

and Waldfogel (2000) document that newspapers report more frequently about issues of

interest to blacks in cities with a larger black share of population. Increases in minority-

targeted content in turn raise black readership. To the extent that candidates use

newspapers to stimulate turnout, majority candidates enjoy a comparative advantage in

reaching their supporters via papers. The smaller the minority, the greater is the

advantage of majority candidates.5


        These two mechanisms suggest that both the absolute size of minorities as well as

their fraction of the total population can influence turnout. The number of minority

citizens may matter because of the fixed costs of supplying media outlets. The population

share of minority citizens can be important because it reflects the incentives of

newspapers and TV stations to target content toward the preferences of minorities.


        To the extent that media content reflects the population share of minorities, we

expect to observe systematic differences in turnout between local and national political

contests, and these differences should depend on the local fraction of blacks. Local races


5
  In models with endogenous policy platforms, policies will reflect the interests of groups that are
comparatively easy to reach. For example, Strömberg (1999b) documents that New Deal spending was
significantly targeted at individuals who owned radios.


                                                   9
are predominantly covered by local media. Locally isolated blacks will thus find it

comparatively difficult to acquire information about issues of interest in local races. In

contrast, blacks living in cities with a large black population will enjoy more informative

coverage. National races, on the other hand, are covered both by local and by national

media. The targeting of national media reflects the national black population share.

While national races might provide more detailed coverage for all citizens – and thus lead

to general increases in turnout – this reasoning suggests that locally isolated blacks stand

to gain most from the existence of a national race. Hence, relative to black turnout in

local elections, increases in black turnout in the presidential race should be largest in

places with few blacks. We will test this conjecture in section V of the paper. Before we

turn to our empirical results, the next section provides some information about our data

sources.




III.   Data


       This study draws on five sources of data.


       A. CPS Voting Data


       Data on voting come from the 1994, 1996, and 1998 Consumer Population

Surveys (CPS). Every two years the CPS asks individuals whether they voted in

November. The dataset, which covers roughly 89,000 potential voters6 in 1994, 78,000 in

1996, and 77,000 in 1998, also reports socioeconomic information about individuals, as




                                              10
well as geographic identifiers. While the 1994 CPS reports counties for all observations,

county identifiers are available for only about a third of potential voters in 1996 and 1998.

Table 1 shows how the raw tendency for US citizens over age 18 to vote varies between

blacks and nonblacks in 1994, 1996, and 1998.7


        B. Census Population Data


        The data on group size in each state and county are drawn from the 1990 Census.

The variation in group shares across states and counties is considerable. As table 2

shows, the unweighted average white population share of counties is 84.5 percent, and the

median is 76.2 percent. The mean state black share is 8.6 percent, and the median is 1.7

percent. There is substantial variation, however. The 75th, 90th, and 95th percentile states

are 10, 30, and 41 percent black.


        C. GSS Data on Political Preferences


        We characterize political preferences using data from the General Social Survey

(GSS), using answers to the question, “Are we spending too much, too little, or the right

amount on…” 15 government spending categories. The GSS is a survey which has been

administered since 1972. The question on spending preferences was included in most

years. These data include about 32,000 whites and 5,000 blacks.


        D. Black-targeted Weekly Newspapers and Radio Stations




6
  We include all persons who are eligible to vote whether they are registered or not. That is, we include
individuals whose response to the question, “Did you vote in the November election?” was “yes” or “no”.
7
  Blacks are non-Hispanic blacks.


                                                    11
           The data for black-targeted weekly newspapers in each MSA is taken from

Burrelle’s Media Directory (2000). The Directory classifies each of the 9,772 weekly

newspapers in the United States according to its intended audience.8 These audiences

consist of twenty-three separate categories, including 224 papers in four categories we

classify as black-targeted (“black,” “black, general,” “ black, Hispanic,” and “black,

religious.”) Data on the number of black-targeted radio stations in each metro area are

derived from Duncan’s American Radio (Duncan and Moon, 1997).




IV.        Do Political Preferences Differ Across Groups?


           Electoral acceleration is likely to arise if groups of citizens with different

preferences for media content also have political preferences that are appreciably different

from those of other groups. For our empirical work, we also require substantial cross-

jurisdiction variation both in the absolute numbers and in the fraction of citizens for this

group. The group of black US citizens meets all three requirements.


           First, as pointed out above, there is substantial variation in the share of blacks

across jurisdictions. Secondly, it is well known that blacks tend to consume different

radio shows, TV programs and newspapers than whites. For example, in the spring of

2000, seven out of the ten most popular TV shows among blacks were rated among the

ten least popular shows among whites (Nielson Media Research, 2000).

    We classify a paper as “weekly” if it is published fewer than seven times per week.


                                                       12
        In this section, we document that the group of black citizens also meets our third

requirement of having substantially different political preferences from whites. We show

how political preferences vary across demographic groups with answers to the question,

“Are we spending too much, too little, or the right amount on…” the following 15 issues:

space program, environment, health, city problems, crime, drugs, education, race

problems, defense, foreign aid, welfare, highways, social security, mass transportation,

and parks. Given the categorical nature of the data, we estimate ordered probit models.

The “Black-Nonblack” rows in table 3 report, for each spending category, the model’s

predicted difference between the two groups in the probability of giving a particular

answer. The results are striking: blacks’ and nonblacks’ answers differ significantly in all

but one spending category (mass transportation). Relative to nonblacks, blacks think that

the US government spends too little on 11 of 15 categories (except the space program,

defense, and highways). These results indicate that blacks and nonblacks have different

political preferences.


        A note about preference differences by race is in order. It is not necessary for our

purposes that preferences differ across race because of race. Even though the results

presented in table 3 remain substantially the same if we add demographic controls, the

differences may simply reflect unobserved heterogeneity in preferences that differs by

race.

V.     Documenting Electoral Acceleration


       A. Empirical Implementation


       We employ three basic empirical strategies for documenting the effect of group

size on a citizen’s tendency to vote. First, we examine the cross sectional relationship

between her tendency to vote in a particular election year and, say, the fraction that are of

her type in her jurisdiction. Second, by pooling black and nonblack data and including

jurisdiction fixed effects, we examine the relationship between, say, the percent black and

the gap between black and white turnout. Third, we make use of the contrast between

local and higher-level (statewide or national) elections to construct longitudinal tests.


       B. Specifications and Results


       1. Cross sectional Analyses


       The simplest measurement framework one might employ is cross sectional,


       (1)     Vi = X i β + α bs + ν i ,


where Vi denotes whether the individual votes, Xi contains individual characteristics

(education dummies, whether she lives in an MSA), bs is the state black share (or the

county black share bc) and νi is an error term. Under our hypotheses, we expect α to be

positive for blacks. In addition to using shares, we can also use the absolute levels of

jurisdiction population. Let Ws be a state’s nonblack population and Bs the black

population. Then the basic setup is




                                             14
       (2)     Vi = X i β + A wW s + A b B s + ν i .


       Under our hypotheses, Ab > 0 for blacks. State and county-level estimates for

these models are reported in table 4. The results are quite striking. Increases in the black

population share increase black and decrease white participation rates significantly both

at the state and at the county level. The effects for the absolute population levels are

more mixed. The size of the black population appears to matter at the county, but not at

the state level. We find qualitatively similar results for 1996 and 1998.


       Though highly suggestive, these basic cross section relationships are vulnerable to

the concern that the relationship between black population shares and group voting

tendencies reflects unobserved heterogeneity in state and county tendencies to vote. That

is, we are concerned that νi=µs+εi, where µs is a jurisdiction fixed effect and εi is a well-

behaved individual error. We can eliminate this unobserved heterogeneity that is constant

across groups within jurisdictions with jurisdiction fixed effects estimates, which we

implement by estimating voting probits on the black percent and/or population terms

interacted with a black dummy, as well as race-specific MSA and education effects. That

is, our second measurement approach pools data by race and includes jurisdiction fixed

effects that are common across race. Define δ b as an indicator that is 1 for black

individuals. For simplicity, we describe the model in terms of the share model given in

(1):


       (3)     Vi = X i β + δ b X i β b + γ 1δ b + γ 2 δ b bs + µ s + ε i .




                                                 15
In this model, µs is the jurisdiction fixed effect and γ2, the coefficient on the black dummy

× jurisdiction black population share, reflects the effect of the state’s black share on the

difference between black and nonblack voting tendencies.


Table 5 reports these results for state-level variables. In 1994 and in 1998, blacks are

significantly more likely to vote, relative to whites, in states with higher black population

shares. We observe the same positive relationship in the presidential year, though the

effect is much smaller and not statistically significant. This is our first hint that electoral

acceleration operates differently in national and in local elections. We will return to this

point below. In columns 3, 6 and 9, we include the interactions of δ b with both the

black population share and with the absolute size of the black and the white populations.

We find that the fraction black is a more important determinant of turnout. Linear

probability models using county-level data confirm the basic pattern: Blacks are more

likely to turn out as the population share of blacks increases.9


         2. Effects of Statewide Races


         Arguments made in section 2 suggest that non-local races, which attract the

attention of regional and national media, are particularly beneficial for locally isolated

blacks whose local media have little incentive to cover issues of concern to minorities.

We start exploring this conjecture by asking whether blacks in predominantly white

counties are more energized by statewide elections than blacks in heavily black counties.

This question is best examined using election data from non-presidential years.


9
  For reasons of space, we do not always report county-level results. The full set of tables is available upon
request.


                                                     16
       Define δ 98 as an indicator for 1998, and δ s as an indicator for the existence of a

statewide race. Then one can estimate the effect of interest using the following

specification,


       (4)       Vi = X i β + φ1δ 98 + φ 2δ s + φ 3δ s bc + µ c + ε i .


In this framework, µc is a county fixed effect. The model is estimated separately by race

on 1994 and 1998 data, and in the black model, the coefficient φ3 shows how much a

statewide election increases the black tendency to vote as the citizen’s county is more

heavily black. For counties with a larger white share than the statewide share of whites,

we expect the non-local media coverage of the statewide race to provide more turnout

inducement to blacks isolated in predominantly white counties. Thus, we expect φ3 to be

negative for blacks. Columns (1) and (2) of table 6 report these results, for whites and

blacks, respectively. We find that φ3 is negative and significant for blacks and small and

insignificant for whites.


       As the county black share reflects the difference between local and

regional/national media to target minorities, the effect presumably depends on how black

the state is. Furthermore, the state black share might assume a greater importance in

explaining the black tendency to vote in statewide elections. To accommodate these

possibilities, we augment specification (4) in three ways. First, we add the state black

share interacted with a statewide dummy,


       (4a)      Vi = X i β + φ1δ 98 + φ 2δ s + φ 3δ s bc + φ 4δ s bs + µ c + ε i .




                                                  17
We expect φ4 to be positive and φ3 to be negative for blacks. Columns (3) and (4) of table

6 report these results. For blacks, φ4 is positive and significant and φ3 is negative and

significant. Neither is significant for whites.


       In a second modification of (4), we include a statewide dummy interacted with the

county and the state black share. This allows the effect of the county black share to differ

according to the black share of the state,


       (4b)     Vi = X i β + φ1δ 98 + φ 2δ s + φ 3δ s bc + φ 4δ s bs + φ 5δ s bs bc + µ c + ε i .


Columns (5) and (6) of table 6 report these results, and φ5 is not significant. A third

possibility is a special case of (4a) that merits mention, namely φ3 = -φ4. We test whether

a county’s excess of black share over the state share influences turnout using the

following specification,


       (4c)     Vi = X i β + φ1δ 98 + φ 2 δ s + φ 6δ s (bc − bs ) + µ c + ε i .


Differences in media coverage at the local and the regional or national level lead us to

expect that φ6 < 0 for blacks. Columns (7) and (8) report this specification. Consistent

with our previous findings, φ6 is negative and significant for blacks and small and

insignificant for whites. That is, the increase in black turnout for a statewide race is

larger, the larger the white population share of the county is relative to the state-level

share of whites.




                                                 18
        3. Effects of a Presidential Contest


        Differences in coverage that is provided by local and national media outlets will

also influence turnout in presidential years. Information on candidate platforms may be

more readily available for presidential races in general, and turnout among all groups may

increase as a result. However, consistent with the effect of state-level contests, we expect

the increase in turnout to be particularly large for locally isolated blacks who have

difficulty learning about local races.


        In a direct comparison between a presidential and a non-presidential race, we

could only identify the effect of interest, αδ 96 bs , by assuming that, but for the

presidential election, 1994 is like 1996. Instead, our strategy is to use three years of data,

which allows us to study the effects of presidential races as deviations from a time trend.

Under our hypotheses, deviations from the time trend should depend on the black

population share. We account for the 1994-1998 trend in two ways. First, we introduce a

time trend t ( t = ( year − 1994) / 2 ). We interact this time trend with the state black share

because it is possible that the general time trend varies with this share. By controlling for

tbs , we avoid interpreting as a black-share specific effect of the presidential contest, what

is in fact a general effect. While we allow the overall tendency to vote to vary by

arbitrary year effects, we force the part of the change in voting that goes with the percent

black to be linear,


        (5)     Vi = X i β + φ 96δ 96 + φ 98δ 98 + α 96δ 96 bs + λtbs + µ s + ε i .




                                                19
In this specification, α 96 shows the effect of interest: Does the 1996 election, relative to

a trend that goes with the percent black, induce larger increases in turnout among isolated

blacks? Columns (1) and (2) of table 7 report estimates of (5) for whites and blacks. The

coefficient α96 is negative and significant for blacks and positive and significant for

whites. This indicates that the presidential election raises turnout among blacks more as

they are more isolated in predominantly white states. We can also estimate specification

(5) with county instead of state-level shares of blacks. The county results show the same

pattern as our state-level findings. A presidential contest is particularly effective in

raising turnout among locally isolated blacks (results available upon request).


       So far, we allow the time trend that goes with the percent black to vary across

states, but without much flexibility. An alternative specification including state-specific

time trends is


       (6)       Vi = X i β + φ 96δ 96 + α 96δ 96 bs + λ s t + µ s + ε i .


In this specification, the year effects pick up deviations from the time trends. Columns

(3) and (4) of table 7 report estimates of (6). The results are consistent with the findings

in the first two columns of table 7. Turnout rates of locally isolated blacks increase to a

greater extent in the presidential year.


       Tables 4-7 provide considerable evidence that electoral acceleration operates. As

black citizens make up a larger share of the population, they become more inclined to

participate in elections. There are many possible reasons for the cross-sectional

relationships that we observe. For instance, politically more active black citizens may


                                                  20
choose to live in cities with larger black populations. However, this type of unobserved

heterogeneity cannot account for our longitudinal results. In the next section, we

investigate more closely one of the mechanisms that can give rise to electoral

acceleration, the availability of minority-targeted media outlets.




VI.    Mechanism


       Our arguments in section 2 suggest that the structure of media markets may be one

reason why electoral acceleration exists. In this section, we explore this mechanism

empirically, using newspapers and radio stations as examples for channels of

communication that can be used to disseminate political information.


       The first two columns of table 8 present regressions of the white and black

tendency to vote on the number of black-targeted newspapers in the MSA. The results

are consistent with the hypothesis that a larger number of black-targeted media outlets

increases black participation rates. The number of weeklies bears a positive relationship

to the black tendency to vote, but none to white participation rates. Column 3 includes a

MSA fixed effect and confirms that, relative to whites, blacks are more likely to vote in

MSAs with more black weeklies. In columns 4, 5 and 6 of table 8, we repeat the analysis

for black weeklies with the number of black-targeted radio stations. Again, we find that

the number of black-targeted stations bears a positive relationship to differences between

black and white voting tendencies. As the results in columns 3 and 6 indicate, the




                                             21
positive effect of the number of minority-targeted media outlets on minority participation

is not due to fixed unobserved differences between MSAs.


         The FCC has long pursued policies promoting minority ownership of broadcast

media, so from a public policy perspective, it is interesting to ask whether white and

black owners of minority-targeted radio stations offer the same inducement for blacks to

participate in elections. We might expect to find race-specific ownership effects if black

owners receive greater benefits than whites from disseminating political information that

is of interest to blacks.10 In columns 7, 8 and 9, we distinguish between black-owned and

white-owned black-targeted stations. Both types of stations induce blacks to vote, while

there is no effect on white participation rates.


         These results appear to confirm that greater access to media increases the

likelihood of participating in elections. However, there is a concern that the number of

media outlets is endogenously determined with the tendency to vote. We address this

issue with a different identification strategy based on changes in the number of black-

targeted radio stations. The 1996 Telecommunications Act substantially lifted

restrictions on local station ownership. This change in legislation caused an increase in

ownership concentration, which in turn significantly reduced the growth of stations and

increased variety (Berry and Waldfogel, forthcoming).


         Using longitudinal data on black-targeted media and voting, we can thus ask how

the black voting tendency changes, 1994 to 1998, with changes in the number of black-

10
  Siegelman and Waldfogel (1998) find that the number of black-owned stations increases the number of
black-targeted stations, all else constant, suggesting that black station owners have different motivations.



                                                      22
targeted media outlets. The first two columns of table 9 show regressions of white and

black voting tendencies on a 1998 dummy, the number of local black-targeted radio

stations, which can substantially change between the two time periods as a result of the

change in legislation, and MSA fixed effects. We find that the white voting tendency is

unaffected by the number of black-targeted radio stations, while black participation rates

increase in the number of stations. These results, consistent with our cross sectional

findings, are not due to fixed unobserved heterogeneity.


        Columns 3 and 4 show that black-targeted stations affect voting differently

according to whether the stations are black-owned. Black-owned and targeted stations

have a large effect on black voting (and a much smaller, albeit significant, positive impact

on white voting), while white-owned black-targeted stations have no significant impact

on black or white voting. This finding suggests that ownership has a consequential effect

on content, even within stations that are targeted at black audiences.


        The results in tables 8 and 9 provide reasonable support for the view that electoral

acceleration is at least in part due to the structure of media markets. As the size of a

group increases, members of this group can enjoy a larger number of media products that

are specifically tailored to their tastes. The existence of these channels of communication

make it easier for candidates to target campaign efforts at the group, thereby lowering the

costs of learning about the candidates’ positions and thus increasing the likelihood of

participation.

VII.   Concluding Discussion


       Theories of democratic decision-making have long recognized that policy

outcomes depend on the spatial distribution of citizen preferences. In the standard

median voter model, for example, “moving” types from one jurisdiction to the next

affects policy by changing the identity of the median citizen. The novel empirical result

of this study is that the tendency to participate in elections also depends on the

distribution of types. This finding has interesting implications for a number of questions

that are of interest to economists and policy-makers. We discuss four of these: the

consequences of electoral acceleration for redistricting, racial heterogeneity and social

capital, the provision of local public goods, and the reasons why citizens vote.


       A. Majority-minority Districts


       A major point of our paper is that there is a systematic bias between the median

voter and the median citizen toward the group whose participation is augmented by its

larger share. But how large is this deviation? Our estimates allow us to calculate this. If

ΦW(p) and ΦB(p) are linear probability estimates mapping a county’s black population

share p to the white and black participation probabilities, respectively, then the black

share of voters is pV = pΦB(p) / [pΦB(p) + (1-p)ΦW(p)]. We calculated pV using our cross

sectional specification (3) with county-level data for 1994. When p is 0, so is pV. At the

median black population share (1.7%), the black share of voters is 30% below the black

share of population (χ2 = 45.36). At the 75th percentile, the difference is 21%



                                             24
(χ2 = 10.84). It is only at the 95th percentile of the black population share (41%) that we

cannot reject the hypothesis that the black population share is equal to the share of black

voters. As demonstrated earlier, these differences tend to be smaller in years with

presidential elections. Using the same specification (3) with county-level data for the

presidential year 1996, we only find significant differences up to the 90th percentile of the

black population share, where the gap amounts to 3% (χ2 = 6.14).


       Electoral acceleration has interesting implications for redistricting. The

mechanism suggests that black turnout will increase if political jurisdictions coincide

with media markets. If black viewers who live in the same media market belong to

different jurisdictions, any news about local races are of interest to only a small fraction

of the black audience. Thus, broadcasting minority-targeted programs may not be

attractive commercially. But if political jurisdictions coincided with media markets,

candidates would find it less expensive to reach black citizens. Our results on the effects

of black owners of minority-targeted stations indicate that patterns of ownership influence

political participation. Increases in the number of black-targeted, black-owned station

result in higher turnout rates, both among the minority and among whites.


       B. Race and Social Capital


       Several measures of social capital such as the tendency to belong to associations

and the level of trustworthiness in groups are negatively correlated with racial

heterogeneity (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2000; Glaeser et al., 2000). For counties with

fewer than 50% blacks, increases in black population shares are synonymous with more

significant racial fragmentation. Electoral acceleration is preserved, and sometimes even


                                              25
strengthened, if we re-estimate the models in section V excluding counties with black

population shares in excess of 50%. This indicates that participation in democratic

decision-making, which is often seen as one important component of social capital,

differs in important respects from other indicators. While other forms of civic

engagement appear to decrease in all groups as racial fragmentation increases, declining

participation rates among whites in more heavily black communities are counterbalanced

by higher turnout among black citizens.


       C. Provision of Local Public Goods


       Electoral acceleration also has general implications for the empirical study of

public policy. In decentralized economies, the responsiveness of the political system to

voter preferences is often measured by relating changes in population characteristics to

policy changes. For instance, cross-sectional variation in median population income is

used to identify the supply of local public goods (Bergstrom and Goodman, 1973). To

the extent that electoral acceleration occurs among the groups of poor and rich citizens,

our results indicate that studies of this sort tend to systematically overestimate these

income elasticities. Electoral acceleration predicts that rising population incomes across

jurisdictions or time go hand in hand with higher voting tendencies for the rich and lower

tendencies for the poor. Consequently, the estimated income elasticities exaggerate the

policy response to rising population incomes.


       D. Black and White Participation Rates




                                              26
         Our work addresses differences between black and white voting tendencies

because whites and blacks belong to different groups: They have substantially different

political preferences, and they tend to consume different media products. However, for

our study, it is not necessary that race causes blacks and whites to belong to different

groups. In contrast to the approach taken here, there is a substantial literature which

assumes that race determines the likelihood of political participation (see the review in

Bobo and Gilliam, 1990).11 Several papers maintain that a strong sense of “ethnic

community” and “black consciousness” influences turnout rates (Verba and Nie, 1972;

Shingles, 1981). Studies using data from the 1950s and 1960s generally find that blacks

are more likely to participate than whites when one controls for demographic differences.

More recent analyses for the late 1980s indicate that such differences have disappeared

(Bobo and Gilliam, 1990).


         Electoral acceleration contributes to this literature by emphasizing that some of

the differences in participation between blacks and whites may be interpreted as

stemming from differences in the fraction of the population that is black. To our

knowledge, this hypothesis has not been tested in previous studies. Rather than

interpreting declining rates of participation among blacks as stemming from changing

values and varying degrees of political empowerment, electoral acceleration suggests that

changes over time in the tendency to vote may reflect changes in the geographic

dispersion of a group. In fact, Cutler et al. (1999) document just such a change: Since


11
  Some studies identify race-specific institutional differences such as voter literacy tests, poll taxes (Filer,
Kenny and Morton, 1991), and political resources in general (Wolfinger and Rosenstone, 1980) as reasons
why turnout rates may differ between races. Others emphasize racial differences in socioeconomic status
(Olsen, 1970; Verba and Nie, 1972).


                                                       27
1970, segregation in the US has decreased considerably because blacks have moved into

previously all-white areas. The theory outlined here predicts that blacks who have moved

and the now less numerous minorities which are left behind are less likely to vote. This

and similar implications of electoral acceleration are interesting avenues for future

research.
