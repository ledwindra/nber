    "abstract": "\n\nWage garnishment allows creditors to deduct money directly from workers\u2019 paychecks to re-pay defaulted debts. We document new facts about wage garnishment between 2014\u20132019 using data from a large payroll processor who distributes paychecks to approximately 20%of U.S. private-sector workers. As of 2019, over one in every 100 workers was being garnished for delinquent debt. The average garnished worker experiences garnishment for five months, during which approximately 11% of gross earnings is remitted to their creditor(s). The beginning of a new garnishment is associated with an increase in job turnover rates but no intensive margin change in hours worked.\n\n",
