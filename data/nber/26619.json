    "abstract": "\n\nBehavioral economists have proposed that incentive contracts result in higher productivity when bonuses are \u201closs framed\u201d\u2014prepaid then clawed back if targets are unmet. We test this claim by randomizing the pre- or post-payment of sales bonuses at 294 car dealerships. Although somewhat statistically imprecise, our analysis provides strong indications that the random assignment of loss framing had quantitatively important negative effects. We document that negative effects of loss framing can arise due to an increase in incentives for \u201cgaming\u201d behaviors. Based on these claims, we reassess the common wisdom regarding the desirability of loss framing.\n\n",
