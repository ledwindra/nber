Macroeconomics and ARCH
James D. Hamilton
NBER Working Paper No. 14151
June 2008
JEL No. E52
ABSTRACT
Although ARCH-related models have proven quite popular in finance, they are less frequently used in
macroeconomic applications. In part this may be because macroeconomists are usually more concerned
about characterizing the conditional mean rather than the conditional variance of a time series. This
paper argues that even if one's interest is in the conditional mean, correctly modeling the conditional
variance can still be quite important, for two reasons. First, OLS standard errors can be quite misleading,
with a "spurious regression" possibility in which a true null hypothesis is asymptotically rejected with
probability one. Second, the inference about the conditional mean can be inappropriately influenced
by outliers and high-variance episodes if one has not incorporated the conditional variance directly
into the estimation of the mean, and infinite relative efficiency gains may be possible. The practical
relevance of these concerns is illustrated with two empirical examples from the macroeconomics literature,
the first looking at market expectations of future changes in Federal Reserve policy, and the second
looking at changes over time in the Fed's adherence to a Taylor Rule.

Introduction.

One of the most influential econometric papers of the last generation was Engle’s (1982a)
introduction of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) as a tool for describing
how the conditional variance of a time series evolves over time. The ISI Web of Science lists
over 2000 academic studies that have cited this article, and simply reciting the acronyms
for the various extensions of Engle’s theme involves a not insignificant commitment of paper
(see Table 1, or the more detailed glossary in Bollerslev, 2008).
The vast majority of empirical applications of ARCH models have studied financial time
series such as stock prices, interest rates, or exchange rates.

To be sure, there have also

been a number of interesting applications of ARCH to macroeconomic questions. Lee, Ni,
and Ratti (1995) noted that the conditional volatility of oil prices, as captured by a GARCH
model, seems to matter for the magnitude of the eﬀect on GDP of a given movement in
oil prices, and Elder and Serletis (2006) use a vector autoregression with GARCH-in-mean
elements to describe the direct consequences of oil-price volatility for GDP. Grier and Perry
(2000) and Fountas and Karanasos (2007) use such models to conclude that inflation and
output volatility also can depress real GDP growth, while Servén (2003) studied the eﬀects
of uncertainty on investment spending.
However, despite these interesting applications, studying volatility has traditionally been
a much lower priority for macroeconomists than for researchers in financial markets because
the former’s interest is primarily in describing the first moments. There seems to be an assumption among many macroeconomists that, if your primary interest is in the first moment,
2

ARCH has little relevance apart from possible GARCH-M eﬀects.
The purpose of this paper is to suggest that even if our primary interest is in estimating
the conditional mean, having a correct description of the conditional variance can still be
quite important, for two reasons.

First, hypothesis tests about the mean in a model in

which the variance is misspecified will be invalid. Second, by incorporating the observed
features of the heteroskedasticity into the estimation of the conditional mean, substantially
more eﬃcient estimates of the conditional mean can be obtained.
Section 2 develops the theoretical basis for these claims, illustrating the potential magnitude of the problem with a small Monte Carlo study and explaining why the popular White
(1980) or Newey-West (1987) corrections may not fully correct for the inference problems
introduced by ARCH. The subsequent sections illustrate the practical relevance of these
concerns using two examples from the macroeconomics literature.

The first application

concerns measures of what the market expects the U.S. Federal Reserve’s next move to
be, and the second explores the extent to which U.S. monetary policy today is following a
fundamentally diﬀerent rule from that observed thirty years ago.
I recognize that it may require more than these limited examples to persuade macroeconomists to pay more attention to ARCH. Another thing I learned from Rob Engle is
that, in addition to coming up with a great idea, it doesn’t hurt if you also have a catchy
acronym that people can use to describe what you’re talking about. After all, where would
we be today if we all had to pronounce “autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity” every
time we wanted to discuss these issues? However, Table 1 reveals that the acronyms one

3

might logically use for “Macroeconomics and ARCH” seem already to be taken. “MARCH”,
for example, is already used (twice), as is “ARCH-M”.
Fortunately, Engle and Manganelli (2004) have shown us that it’s also OK to mix upperand lower-case letters, picking and choosing handy vowels or consonants so as to come up
with something catchy, as in “CAViaR” (Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk).

In

that spirit, I propose to designate “Macroeconomics and ARCH” as “McARCH.” Maybe
not a new product so much as new packaging.
Herewith, then, discussion of the relevance of McARCH.

GARCH and inference about the mean.

We can illustrate some of the issues with the following simple model:
yt = β 0 + β 1 yt−1 + ut

(1)

p

(2)

ut =

ht vt

ht = κ + αu2t−1 + δht−1

for t = 1, 2, ..., T

h0 = κ/(1 − α − δ)
vt ∼ i.i.d. N(0, 1).

(3)

Bollerslev (1986, pp. 312-313) showed that if
3α2 + 2αδ + δ 2 < 1,

4

(4)

then the noncentral unconditional second and fourth moments of ut exist and are given by
κ
1−α−δ

(5)

3κ2 (1 + α + δ)
.
(1 − α − δ)(1 − δ 2 − 2αδ − 3α2 )

(6)

µ2 = E(u2t ) =
µ4 = E(u4t ) =

Consider the consequences if the mean parameters β 0 and β 1 are estimated by ordinary least
squares,
β̂ =

³X

xt xt

´−1 ³X

xt yt

´

β = (β 0 , β 1 )0
xt = (1, yt−1 )0 ,
and where all summations are for t = 1, ..., T. Suppose further that inference is based on
the usual OLS formula for the variance, with no correction for heteroskedasticity:
V̂ = s2

³X

0

xt xt

s2 = (T − 2)−1

Consider first the consequences of this inference when the fourth-moment condition (4)
is satisfied. For simplicity of exposition, consider the case when the true value of β = 0.
Then from the standard consistency results (e.g., Lee and Hansen, 1994; Lumsdaine, 1996)

To calculate the value of this variance, recall (e.g., Hamilton, 1994, p. 666) that the
GARCH(1,1) structure for ut implies an ARMA(1,1) structure for u2t :
u2t = κ + (δ + α)u2t−1 + wt − δwt−1
6

for wt−1 a white noise process.

It follows from the first-order autocovariance for an

ARMA(1,1) process (e.g., Box and Jenkins, 1976, p. 76) that
E(u2t u2t−1 ) = E(u2t − µ2 )(u2t−1 − µ2 ) + µ22
= ρ(µ4 − µ22 ) + µ22

(11)

for
ρ=

(1 − δ 2 − 2αδ − 3α2 )

with the last equality following from (5) and (6).
Notice that V11 ≥ 1, with equality if and only if α = 0. Thus OLS treats

√
T β̂ 1 as

approximately N(0, 1), whereas the true asymptotic distribution is Normal with a variance
bigger than unity, meaning that the OLS t test will systematically reject more often than it
should. The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis that β 1 = 0 (even though the null
hypothesis is true) gets bigger and bigger as the parameters get closer to the region at which
the fourth moment becomes infinite, at which point the asymptotic rejection probability
becomes unity. Figure 1 plots the rejection probability as a function of a and δ. If these
parameters are in the range typically found in estimates of GARCH processes, an OLS t
7

test with no correction for heteroskedasticity would spuriously reject with arbitrarily high
probability for a suﬃciently large sample.
The good news is that the rate of divergence is pretty slow— it may take a lot of observations before the accumulated excess kurtosis overwhelms the other factors. I simulated
10,000 samples from the above Gaussian GARCH process for samples of size T = 100, 200,
and 1000 and 10,000, (and 1,000 samples of size 100,000), where the true values were specified
as follows:
β0 = β1 = 0
κ=2
α = 0.35
δ = 0.6.
The solid line in Figure 2 plots the fraction of samples for which an OLS t test of β 1 = 0
exceeds two in absolute value. Thinking we’re only rejecting a true null hypothesis 5% of
the time, we would in fact do so 15% of the time in a sample of size T = 100 and 33% of
the time when T = 1, 000.
As one might imagine, for a given sample size, the OLS t-statistic is more poorly behaved
if the true innovations vt in (2) are Student’s t with 5 degrees of freedom (the dashed line
in Figure 2) rather than Normal.
What happens if instead of the OLS formula (7) for the variance of β̂ we use White’s

ARCH is not a special case of the class of heteroskedasticity for which Ṽ is intended to be
robust, and indeed, unlike typical cases, T Ṽ is not a consistent estimate of a given matrix:

û2t xt xt will diverge if the fourth moment µ4 is infinite. Figure 3 plots the simu-

lated value for the square root of the lower-right element of T Ṽ for the Gaussian simulations
above.

However, this growth in the estimated variance of

the growth of the actual variance of

√
T β̂ 1 is exactly right, given

√
T β̂ 1 implied by the GARCH specification.

And a

t test based on (13) seems to perform reasonably well for all sample sizes (see the second
row of Table 2).

The small-sample size distortion for the White test is a little worse for

Student’s t compared with Normal errors, though still acceptable. Table 2 also explores the
consequences of using the Newey-West (1987) generalization of the White formula to allow
for serial correlation, using a lag window of q = 5:

These results (reported in the third row of the two panels of Table 2) illustrate one potential
pitfall of relying too much on “robust” statistics to solve the small-sample problems, in that
9

it has more serious size distortions than does the simple White statistic for all specifications
investigated.
Another reason one might not want to assume that White or Newey-West standard errors
can solve all the problems is that these formulas only correct the standard error for β̂, but are
still using the OLS estimate itself, which from Figure 3 was seen not to be

√
T convergent.

By contrast, even if the fourth moment does not exist, maximum likelihood estimation as an
alternative to OLS is still

√
T convergent. Hence the relative eﬃciency gains of MLE relative

to OLS become infinite as the sample size grows for typical values of GARCH parameters.
Engle (1982, p. 999) observed that it is also possible to have an infinite relative eﬃciency
gain for some parameter values even with exogenous explanatory variables and ARCH as
opposed to GARCH errors.
Results here are also related to the well-known result that ARCH will render inaccurate
traditional tests for serial correlation in the mean.

That fact has previously been noted,

for example, by Milhøj (1985, 1987), Diebold (1988), Stambaugh (1993), and Bollerslev and
Mikkelsen (1996). However, none of the above seems to have commented on the fact (though
it is implied by the formulas they use) that the test size goes to unity as the fourth moment
approaches infinity, or noted the implications as here for OLS regression.
Finally, I observe that just checking for a diﬀerence between the OLS and the White
standard errors will sometimes not be suﬃcient to detect these problems. The diﬀerence
between V̂ and Ṽ will be governed by the size of
X
0
(s2 − û2t )xt xt .
10

White (1980) suggested a formal test of whether this magnitude is suﬃciently small on the
0

basis of an OLS regression of û2t on the vector ψ t consisting of the unique elements of xt xt .
2
In the present case, ψ t = (1, yt−1 , yt−1
)0 . White showed that, under the null hypothesis that

the OLS standard errors are correct, T R2 from a regression of û2t on ψ t would have a χ2 (2)
distribution. The next-to-last row of each panel of Table 2 reports the fraction of samples
for which this test would (correctly) reject the null hypothesis. It would miss about half the
time in a sample as small as 100 observations but is more reliable for larger sample sizes.
Alternatively, one can look at Engle’s (1982) analogous test for the null of homoskedasticity against the alternative of qth-order ARCH by looking at T R2 from a regression of
û2t on (1, û2t−1 , û2t−2 , ..., û2t−q )0 , which asymptotically has a χ2 (q) distribution under the null.
The last rows in Table 2 report the rejection frequency for this test using q = 3 lags. Not
surprisingly, since this test is designed specifically for the ARCH class of alternatives whereas
the White test is not, this test has a little more power. Its advantage over the White test
for homoskedasticity is presumably greater in many macro applications in which xt includes
a number of variables and their lags, in which case the vector ψ t can become unwieldy,
whereas the Engle test remains a simple χ2 (q) regardless of the size of xt .
The philosophy of McARCH, then, is quite simple. The Engle T R2 diagnostic should
be calculated routinely in any macroeconomic analysis. If a violation of homoskedasticity is
found, one should compare the OLS estimates with maximum likelihood to make sure that
the inference is robust. The following sections illustrate the potential importance of doing
so with two examples from applied macroeconomics.

11

Application 1: Measuring market expectations of
what the Federal Reserve is going to do next.

My first example is adapted from Hamilton (forthcoming). The fed funds rate is a marketdetermined interest rates at which banks lend reserves to one another overnight.

This

interest rate is extremely sensitive to the supply of reserves created by the Fed, and in
recent years monetary policy has been implemented in terms of a clearly announced target
for the fed funds rate that the Fed intends to achieve.
A critical factor that determines how Fed actions aﬀect the economy is expectations by
the public as to what the Fed is going to do next, as discussed, for example, in my (2008)
paper. One natural place to look for an indication of what those expectations might be is
the fed funds futures market.
Let t = 1, 2, .., T index monthly observations.

In the empirical results reported here,

t = 1 corresponds to October, 1988 and the last observation (T = 213) is June 2006. For
each month, we’re interested in what the market expects for the average eﬀective fed funds
rate over that month, denoted rt . For the empirical estimates reported in this section, rt
is measured in basis points, so that for example rt = 525 corresponds to an annual interest
rate of 5.25%.
On any business day, one can enter into a futures contract through the Chicago Board of
Trade whose settlement is based on what the value of rt+j actually turns out to be for some
future month. The terms of a j-month-ahead contract traded on the last day of month t can

12

(j)

be translated1 into an interest rate ft

(j)

such that, if rt+j turns out to be less than ft , then

the seller of the contract has to compensate the buyer a certain amount (specifically, $41.67
(j)

on a standard contract) for every basis point by which ft
buyer pays the seller.

(j)

Since ft

exceeds rt+j . If ft(j) < rt+j , the

is known as of the end of month t but rt+j will not be

known until the end of month t + j, the buyer of the contract is basically making a bet that
(j)

rt+j will be less than ft . If the marginal market participant were risk neutral, it would be
the case that
(j)

ft

= Et (rt+j )

(14)

where Et (.) denotes the mathematical expectation on the basis of any information publicly
(j)

available as of the last day of month t. If (14) holds, we could just look at the value of ft

to infer what market participants expect the Federal Reserve to do in the coming months.
However, previous investigators such as Sack (2004) and Piazzesi and Swanson (forthcoming) have concluded that (14) does not hold. The simplest way to investigate this claim
is to construct the forecast error implied by the 1-month-ahead contract,
(1)

(1)

ut = rt − ft−1
and test whether this error indeed has mean zero, as it should if (14) were correct.

For

contracts at longer horizons j > 1, one can look at the monthly change in contract terms,
(j)

(j−1)

ut = ft
1

(j)

− ft−1 .

Specifically, if Pt is the price of the contract agreed to by the buyer and seller on day t, then ft =
100 × (100 − Pt ).

13

(j)

If (14) holds, then ut would also be a martingale diﬀerence sequence:
(j)

ut = Et (rt+j−1 ) − Et−1 (rt+j−1 ).
One simple test is then to perform the regression
(j)

(j)

ut = µ(j) + εt

and test the null hypothesis that µ(j) = 0; this is of course just the usual t-test for a sample
mean.

Table 3 reports the results of this test using 1-, 2-, and 3-month-ahead futures
(1)

contracts. For the historical sample, the 1-month-ahead futures contract ft
(j)

the value of rt+1 by an average of 2.66 basis points and ft

overestimated
(j−1)

overestimated the value of ft+1

by almost 4 basis points. One interpretation is that there is a risk premium built into these
contracts. Another possibility is that the market participants failed to recognize fully the
chronic decline in interest rates over this period.
Before putting too much credence in such interpretations, however, recall that the theory
(j)

(14) implies that ut should be a martingale diﬀerence sequence but makes no claims about
predictability of its variance.

(j)

Figure 4 reveals that each of the series ut

exhibits some

clustering of volatility and a significant decline in variability over time, in addition to occasional very large outliers. Engle’s T R2 test for omitted 4th-order ARCH finds very strong
(1)

(3)

evidence of conditional heteroskedasticity at least for ut and ut ; see Table 3. Hence if we
are interested in a more accurate estimate of the bias and statistical test of its significance,
we might want to model these features of the data.
Hamilton (forthcoming) calculated maximum likelihood estimates for parameters of the
14

following EGARCH specification (with (j) superscripts on all variables and parameters suppressed for ease of readability):
ut = µ +

p

ht εt

log ht − γ 0 zt = α(|εt−1 | − k2 ) + δ(log ht−1 − γ 0 zt−1 )

2 νΓ[(ν + 1)/2]

k2 = E|εt | =
(ν − 1) πΓ(ν/2)
for εt a Student’s t variable with ν degrees of freedom and Γ(.) the gamma function:
Γ(s) =

The log likelihood is then found from

f(ut |Ut−1 , θ) = k1 / ht [1 + (ε2t /ν)]−(ν+1)/2
√
k1 = Γ[(ν + 1)/2]/[Γ(ν/2) νπ].

Given numerical values for the parameter vector θ = (µ, γ 0 , α, δ, ν)0 and observed data
UT = (u1 , u2 , ..., uT )0 we can then begin the iteration (16) for t = 1 by setting h1 = exp(γ 0 z0 ).
Plugging this into (15) gives us a value for ε1 , which from (16) gives us the number for h2 .
Iterating in this fashion gives the sequence {ht , εt }Tt=1 from which the log likelihood (17)
can be evaluated for the specified numerical value of θ. One then tries another guess for θ
in order to numerically maximize the likelihood function. Asymptotic standard errors can

15

be obtained from numerical second derivatives of the log likelihood as in Hamilton (1994,
equation [5.8.3]).
Maximum likelihood parameter estimates are reported in Table 4. Adding these features
provides an overwhelming improvement in fit, with a likelihood ratio test statistic well in
excess of 100 when adding just 4 parameters to a simple Gaussian specification with constant
variance.

The very low estimated degrees of freedom results from the big outliers in the

data, and both the serial dependence (δ) and trend parameter (γ 2 ) for the variance are
extremely significant.
A very remarkable result is that the estimates for the mean of the forecast error µ actually
switch signs, shrink by an order of magnitude, and become far from statistically significant.
Evidently the sample means of u(j)
t are more influenced by negative outliers and observations
early in the sample than they should be.
Note that for this example, the problem is not adequately addressed by simply replacing
OLS standard errors with White standard errors, since when the regressors consist only
of a constant term, the two would be identical.

Moreover, whenever, as here, there is

an aﬃrmative objective of obtaining accurate estimates of a parameter (the possible risk
premium incorporated in these prices) as opposed solely to testing a hypothesis, the concern
is with the quality of the coeﬃcient estimate itself rather than the correct size of a hypothesis
test.

Application 2: Using the Taylor Rule to summarize
changes in Federal Reserve policy.

One of the most influential papers for both macroeconomic research and policy over the last
decade has been John Taylor’s (1993) proposal of a simple rule that the central bank should
follow in setting an interest rate like the fed funds rate rt . Taylor’s proposal called for the
Fed to raise the interest rate by an amount governed by a parameter ψ 1 when the observed
inflation rate π t is higher than it wishes (so as to bring inflation back down), and to raise
the interest rate by an amount governed by ψ 2 when yt , the gap between real GDP and its
potential value, is positive:
rt = ψ 0 + ψ 1 π t + ψ 2 yt
In this equation, the value of ψ 0 reflects factors such as the Fed’s long-run inflation target
and the equilibrium real interest rate.

There are a variety of ways such an expression

has been formulated in practice, such as “forward-looking” specifications, in which the Fed
is responding to what it expects to happen next to inflation and output, and “backwardlooking” specifications, in which lags are included to capture expectations formation and
adjustment dynamics.
A number of studies have looked at the way that the coeﬃcients in such a relation may
have changed over time, including Judd and Rudebusch (1998), Clarida, Galí and Gertler
(2000), Jalil (2004), and Boivin and Giannoni (2006). Of particular interest has been that
the claim that the coeﬃcient on inflation ψ 1 has increased relative to the 1970s, and that
this increased willingness on the part of the Fed to fight inflation has been a factor helping
17

to make the U.S. economy become more stable.

In this paper, I will explore the variant

investigated by Judd and Rudebusch, whose reduced-form representation is
∆rt = γ 0 + γ 1 π t + γ 2 yt + γ 3 yt−1 + γ 4 rt−1 + γ 5 ∆rt−1 + vt .

(18)

Here t = 1, 2, ..., T now will index quarterly data, with t = 1 in my sample corresponding
to 1956:Q1 and T = 205 corresponding to 2007:Q1. The value of rt for a given quarter is
the average of the three monthly series for the eﬀective fed funds rate, with ∆rt = rt − rt−1 ,
and for empirical results here is reported as percent rather than basis points, e.g., rt = 5.25
when the average fed funds rate over the three months of the quarter is 5.25%. Inflation
π t is measured as 100 times the natural logarithm of the diﬀerence between the level of
the implicit GDP deflator for quarter t and its value for the corresponding quarter of the
preceding year, with data taken from Bureau of Economic Analysis Table 1.1.9. As in Judd
and Rudebusch, the output gap yt was calculated as
yt =

100(Yt − Yt∗ )
Yt∗

for Yt the level of real GDP (in billions of chained 2000 dollars, from BEA Table 1.1.6) and
Yt∗ the series for potential GDP from the Congressional Budget Oﬃce (obtained from the
St. Louis FRED database). Judd and Rudebusch focused on certain rearrangements of the
parameters in (18), though here I will simply report results in terms of the reduced-form
estimates themselves. The term vt in (18) is the regression error.
Table 5 presents results from OLS estimation of (18) using the full sample of data. Of
particular interest are γ 1 and γ 2 , the contemporary responses to inflation and output, respectively.

Table 6 then re-estimates the relation, allowing for separate coeﬃcients since
18

1979:Q3, when Paul Volcker became Chair of the Federal Reserve. The OLS results reproduce the findings of the many researchers noted above that monetary policy seems to have
responded much more vigorously to disturbances since 1979, with the inflation coeﬃcient γ 1
increasing by 0.26 and the output coeﬃcient γ 2 increasing by 0.64.
However, the White standard errors for the coeﬃcients on dt π t and dt yt are almost twice
as large as the OLS standard errors, and suggest that the increased response to inflation is
in fact not statistically significant and the increased response to output is measured very
imprecisely. Moreover, Engle’s LM test for the null of Gaussian errors with no heteroskedasticity against the alternative of 4th-order ARCH leads to overwhelming rejection of the null
hypothesis.2

All of which suggests that, if we are indeed interested in measuring the

magnitudes by which these coeﬃcients have changed, it is preferable to adjust not just the
standard errors but the parameter estimates themselves in light of the dramatic ARCH
displayed in the data.
I therefore estimated the following GARCH-t generalization of (18):
0

yt = xt β + vt
vt =

p
ht εt

ht = κ + h̃t
2
h̃t = α(vt−1
− κ) + δ h̃t−1

with εt a Student’s t random variable with ν degrees of freedom.
2

Siklos and Wohar (2005) also make this point.

19

(19)
Iteration on (19) is

initialized with h̃1 = 0. The log likelihood is then evaluated exactly as in (17). Maximum
likelihood estimates are reported in Table 7.
Once again generalizing a homoskedastic Gaussian specification is overwhelmingly favored by the data, with a comparison of the specifications in Tables 6 and 7 producing a
likelihood ratio χ(4) statistic of 183.34. The degrees of freedom for the Student’s t distribution are only 2.29, and the implied GARCH process is highly persistent (α̂ + δ̂ = 0.82). Of
particular interest is the fact that the changes in the Fed’s response to inflation and output
are now considerably smaller than suggested by the OLS estimates. The change in γ 1 is now
estimated to be only 0.09 and the change in γ 2 has dropped to 0.05 and no longer appears
to be statistically significant.
Figure 5 oﬀers some insight into what produces these results. The top panel illustrates
the tendency for interest rates to exhibit much more volatility at some times than others, with
the 1979:Q2 to 1982:Q3 episode particularly dramatic. The bottom panel plots observations
on the pairs (yt , ∆rt ) in the second half of the sample. The apparent positive slope in that
scatter plot is strongly influenced by the observations in the 1979-82 period. If one allowed
the possibility of serial dependence in the squared residuals, one would give less weight to
the 1979-82 observations, resulting in a flatter slope estimate over 1979-2007 relative to OLS.
This is not to attempt to overturn the conclusion of earlier researchers that there has
been a change in Fed policy in the direction of a more active policy. A comparison of the
changing-parameter specification of Table 7 with a fixed-parameter GARCH specification
produces a χ(4) likelihood ratio statistic of 18.22, which is statistically significant with a

20

p-value of 0.001.

Nevertheless, the magnitude of this change appears to be substantially

smaller than one would infer on the basis of OLS estimates of the parameters.
Nor is this discussion meant to displace the large and thoughtful literature on possible
changes in the Taylor Rule, which has raised a number of other substantive issues not
explored here. These include whether one wants to use real-time or subsequent revised data
(Orphanides (2001)), the distinction between the “backward-looking” Taylor Rule explored
here and “forward-looking” specifications (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, 2000), and continuous
evolution of parameters rather than a sudden break (Jalil, 2004; Boivin, 2006). The simple
exercise undertaken nevertheless does in my mind establish the potential importance for
macroeconomists to check for the presence of ARCH even when their primary interest is in
the conditional mean.

5

Conclusions.

The reader may note that both of the examples I have used to illustrate the potential
relevance of McARCH use the fed funds rate as the dependent variable. This is not entirely
an accident.

Although Kilian and Gonçalves (2004) concluded that most macro series

exhibit some ARCH, the fed funds rate may be the macro series for which one is most likely
to observe wild outliers and persistent volatility clustering, regardless of the data frequency
or subsample. It is nevertheless, as the examples used here illustrate, a series that features
very importantly for some of the most fundamental questions in macroeconomics.
The rather dramatic way in which accounting for outliers and ARCH can change one’s

21

inference that was seen in these examples presumably would not be repeated for every
macroeconomic relation estimated.

However, routinely checking something like a T R2

statistic, or the diﬀerence between OLS and White standard errors, seems a relatively costless
and potentially quite beneficial habit. And the assumption by many practitioners that we
can avoid all these problems simply by always relying on the White standard errors may not
represent best possible practice.
