Assessing the Federal Deduction for State and Local Tax Payments
Gilbert E. Metcalf
NBER Working Paper No. 14023
May 2008
JEL No. H2,H71,H77
ABSTRACT
Federal deductibility for state and local taxes constitutes one of the largest tax expenditures in the
federal budget and provides a significant source of federal support to state and local governments.
Deductibility was restricted in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 by removing the deduction for general
sales taxes. More recently the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform recommended eliminating
the deduction altogether as one of several revenue-raising initiatives to finance comprehensive tax
reform.
I carry out a number of distributional analyses – considering both variation across income and across
states – of the subsidy from deductibility as well as the distributional impact of potential partial reforms.
In addition, I consider three counterfactuals for 2004 – a tax system without the Bush tax cuts for
2001 and 2003, a tax system without the 2004 AMT patch, and a tax system without the AMT – to
see how the benefits of deductibility are affected by these changes in the tax law.
Next I consider how behavioral responses affect the tax expenditure estimates. Feldstein and Metcalf
(1987) argued that tax expenditures overestimate the revenue gain from eliminating deductibility as
they do not take into account a likely shift away from once-deductible taxes to non-deductible taxes
and fees in the absence of deductibility. Many of these latter taxes and fees are paid by businesses.
As business costs rise, federal business tax collections would fall, offsetting some of the gains of ending
deductibility. Feldstein and Metcalf also found that ending deductibility would have little if any impact
on state and local spending itself. Using a large panel of data on state and local governments, I revisit
this issue and find that the Feldstein-Metcalf results are robust to adding more years of analysis.

Introduction
One of the most valuable deductions on the individual income tax return is the

deduction for state and local income and property taxes. Taking all state and local tax
deductions as a group, the deduction is second only to the deduction for mortgage interest
on owner occupied homes in aggregate importance for individual taxpayers (Office of
Management and Budget (2008)). This deduction has come under attack at various times
despite its widespread popularity. The most serious threat came in the run-up to the Tax
Reform Act of 1986. While the elimination of the entire deduction for state and local
taxes was proposed, TRA86 only removed the deduction for general sales taxes. And this
curtailment was undone to some extent in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 when
the option was allowed to deduct either income or sales taxes.1 This deduction came
under scrutiny again by President George W. Bush's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax
Reform. The panel argued that ending this deduction would contribute to a "cleaner and
broader tax base" and a tax system that was more equitable across income groups.2
While the Panel's recommendations remain to be taken up by Congress, this
deduction has been eroded to some extent by two features of the federal tax code. First,
limitations on itemized deductions reduce the value of this deduction for some
households with large amounts of itemized deductions. Second, the Alternative
Minimum Tax (AMT) targets this deduction directly. In fact, a major determinant of
whether a taxpayer becomes subject to the AMT is the presence of large deductions for
state and local taxes. A taxpayer facing the AMT loses this deduction.

This primarily benefitted those states with a general sales tax but no income tax: Florida, Nevada, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.

The magnitude of the tax expenditure for state and local tax deductions makes it a
prime target for policy makers looking for revenue to pay for other changes in the tax
code.3 Feldstein and Metcalf (1987), however, argued that estimates of the revenue gain
from eliminating deductibility were too high as they did not take into account a likely
shift away from once-deductible taxes to non-deductible taxes and fees in the absence of
deductibility. Many of these latter taxes and fees are paid by businesses. As these costs
rise, federal business tax collections would fall, offsetting some of the gains of ending
deductibility. Feldstein and Metcalf also found that ending deductibility would have little
if any impact on state and local spending itself.
Given the interest in changing or eliminating this subsidy, I present a number of
distributional analyses – considering both variation across income and across states – of
the subsidy from deductibility. In particular I show that eliminating the deduction or
curtailing it adds progressivity to the federal income tax. In addition, I consider three
counterfactuals for 2004 – a tax system without the Bush tax cuts for 2001 and 2003, a
tax system without the 2004 AMT patch, and a tax system without the AMT – to see how
the benefits of deductibility are affected by these changes in the tax law. Then I consider
how behavioral changes affect the tax expenditure estimates. Using a large panel of data
on state and local governments, I revisit this issue and find that the Feldstein-Metcalf
results are robust to adding more years of analysis.
The regressive nature of the subsidy combined with its inability to stimulate
overall state and local spending makes a strong case for removing the deduction. One
might make a case for the subsidy on the grounds that it serves as a type of commodity
subsidy for certain state and local services that could be optimal in a world with

over time. It also carries out a number of distributional analyses similar in spirit to those in this paper.

limitations on the ability to tax labor income sufficiently flexibly (the general case for
violating production efficiency is given in Stiglitz (1982) and Naito (1999)). Whether the
institutional restrictions on income tax design are sufficient to support a subsidy to state
and local taxes is not entirely clear. Saez (2004), however, argues that in the long-run
production efficiency can be restored in models where it appears that commodity taxes or
subsidies are part of an optimal tax system. Thus it is difficult to find support for this
deduction on equity or efficiency grounds
II.

Background
The deduction for state and local taxes is a significant form of federal aid to state

and local governments. In the most recent budget submission, the deductions for all nonbusiness state and local taxes amounts to nearly $50 billion in FY2009, making it the fifth
largest tax expenditure in the federal budget (Office of Management and Budget (2008)).
While state and local tax deductibility dates to the creation of the modern income tax, it
became a major focus of research activity in the mid-1980s when President Ronald
Reagan proposed to eliminate the deduction as part of the first tax reform proposal in late
1984. The final legislation, The Tax Reform Act of 1986, ultimately eliminated the
deduction for general sales taxes. Many felt that this was not especially controversial as
most taxpayers used sales tax look-up tables which, from an individual taxpayer's point
of view, did not necessarily appear related to their own spending.
Early research on this topic focused on the role that deductibility played in
encouraging state and local spending. After all, one of the rationales for the deduction is
to support spending at the sub-national level that might have significant spillover effects
into other jurisdictions. Spending on public parks, for example, by one community might
benefit members of other communities who could enjoy the park. In other words, state

3

and local spending could have important positive externalities or be public goods. In the
absence of federal intervention, it was argued that state and local governments were
unlikely to provide the optimal amount of these goods and services.4 Early papers in this
literature include Noto and Zimmerman (1983, (1984), and Ladd (1984). Attention was
increasingly paid to the mix of taxes chosen as well as the level of spending.
Zimmerman (1983) provided a median voter analysis of the relationship of income tax
reliance on deductibility while Hettich and Winer (1984) provided a political economy
analysis. Neither paper was successful at finding a economically sensible relationship
between deductibility and tax reliance.
Feldstein and Metcalf (1987) employed an average voter framework to analyze
the impact of deductibility on state and local spending and tax reliance. Their innovation
was to use the IRS Public Use Files with the NBER's tax calculator, TAXSIM, to
estimate average marginal tax prices for state and local deductible taxes. Based on a
cross-section of states, they found little evidence that own-source spending was affected
by deductibility but did find that the mix of tax instruments was influenced by the
deduction. Subsequent work by Holtz-Eakin and Rosen (1986), Metcalf (1993), and
Gade and Adkins (1990) corroborated the findings of Feldstein and Metcalf using
different time periods, and various combinations of state and local governments.5
Figure 1 shows the state and local tax expenditure for non-business taxes
excluding the property tax in real dollars (1982-84). The tax expenditure drops off
sharply after 1986 with the drop in marginal tax rates following TRA86. It then has
4

Whether state and local government goods and services are public goods or provide positive externalities
is a question I do not address in this paper.

Feldstein and Metcalf's results suggested that states would shift away from their reliance on general sales
taxes after 1986. This appeared not to happen. A number of papers addressed this issue including Inman
(1989), Courant and Gramlich (1990), Metcalf (1992), and Metcalf (1993). More recent work by Izraeli
and Kellman (2003) suggests that reliance on the general sales tax did eventually fall once sufficient time
had passed.

increased steadily until the Bush tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. A similar pattern is
observed for the tax expenditure for state and local property taxes (Figure 2). Figure 3
scales the tax expenditures for state and local taxes by state and local own-source
revenue. Again the pattern holds of a decline in the ratio after 1986 followed by a steady
increase until this decade. Figure 4 shows two key determinants of the level of tax
expenditures. It measures the ratio of state and local taxes to personal income and the
national average marginal tax rate on wage income as computed by TAXSIM. The sharp
decline in marginal tax rates after TRA86 explains the sharp fall in tax expenditures in
1987. The gradual increase in the share of state and local taxes in personal income along
with the rise in marginal tax rates contributes to the growth in tax expenditures. This
trend stops with the sharp fall in marginal tax rates beginning in 2001.
III.

Measuring the Revenue Loss from State and Local Tax Deductibility
Before considering any behavioral responses that might arise from ending

deductibility, I provide some statistics on measurements of the tax expenditure for
deductibility where behavioral responses are ignored. I first focus on errors that arise
from adding tax expenditure estimates. Both OMB and the Joint Committee on Taxation
report tax expenditure estimates for state and local tax deductibility separately. In
general, users are cautioned not to add tax expenditure estimates given interactions within
the tax code as deduction and other tax expenditure items are changed. For example, one
might expect that eliminating the deduction for all state and local personal taxes would
yield a smaller tax expenditure estimate than the sum of the tax expenditures for personal
non-property taxes and property taxes since removing one of the deduction will push
some taxpayers below the threshold for itemizing deductions at which point their other
state and local tax deduction becomes worthless. On the other hand, removing one tax

5

deduction could push taxpayers into higher tax brackets thereby making the other
deduction more valuable. Thus whether summing individual tax expenditures over or
underestimates the tax expenditure estimate from removing both deductions is a priori
uncertain.
The first row of Table 1 shows results from using TAXSIM to estimate the state
and local tax deduction tax expenditures for calendar year 2004 using the SOI public use
file assuming elimination of the deduction under current law. This is the difference in tax
liability for an individual return (as calculated by TAXSIM) between the current law and
the law assuming the elimination of the deduction. This difference is computed at the
individual level and then aggregated using the weight from the SOI dataset. The sum of
the individual estimates underestimates the aggregate measure by less than one-half of
one percent. This suggests that adding the two estimates does not seriously misrepresent
the estimate of the tax expenditure from ending both deductions simultaneously.6 Figure
5 shows this error over time. It peaks at 5 percent in 1993 and has been steadily falling
since.
I also consider the errors in adding the tax expenditure estimates under different
assumptions about the tax law. In the second row of Table 1, I assume that no AMT
patch is applied in 2004. Now adding the estimates underestimates the aggregate tax
expenditure estimate by 8 percent. The error is smaller if the AMT is eliminated
altogether or the Bush tax cuts not in effect. In either case the error is less than 5 percent.
In short, it does not appear that large errors occur when adding tax expenditure estimates

6

At the taxpayer level, adding expenditure estimates overestimates the tax expenditure by at least $580 for
one percent of returns and underestimates the tax expenditure by at least $700 for one percent of returns.
The error for ninety percent of taxpayers is $104 or less. The error is less than one-half of one percent of
cash income for over 98 percent of filers.

6

for the two state and local tax deduction tax expenditures to get an estimate of the tax
expenditure arising from eliminating all state and local tax deductions altogether.
Next I provide estimates of tax expenditures for other changes to this deduction
and consider the interaction between the federal tax treatment of state and local tax
payments and the Bush tax cuts as well as the AMT. In particular, I consider three other
reforms. The first replaces the deduction with a 15 percent non-refundable tax credit. In
effect this allows all taxpayers to deduct their state and local taxes as if they were in the
15 percent tax bracket.7 The second reform caps the deduction. I consider two caps: one
where all taxes are subject to a cap of $5,000 per year and a second where the cap is set
equal to 3.5 percent of AGI. The third reform allows a deduction above a floor. If
policymakers believe that the tax deduction has positive incentive effects, the floor
lowers the cost of providing the deduction while continuing to provide an incentive for
state and local spending. Like the cap, I provide two types of floors: one set at $7,575
and a second set at 4.4 percent of AGI. The two caps and floors are constructed to
generate a tax expenditure of $35 billion in 2004. Results are shown in Table 2.
The first column of Table 2 shows the revenue cost under current law of taking
intermediate actions rather than entirely eliminating the deduction for state and local
taxes. Replacing the deduction with a 15 percent tax credit raises considerably less than
eliminating the deduction in part because taxpayers who were not receiving the benefit of
the deduction due to their taking the standard deduction now have the opportunity to take

7

I calculate state income taxes for non-itemizers using the TAXSIM state tax calculator. For property
taxes, I hot deck from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. I draw a similar taxpayer from the CEX (based
on income category and number of dependents) and check to see if the taxpayer would itemize using the
mortgage interest and property tax deduction imputed from the CEX (along with the calculated state
income tax deduction). If this return would itemize, I discard the CEX household and draw another similar
household. If this return would not itemize, I use this household's property tax payment for the SOI
taxpayer.

7

the credit. As noted above, the cap and floor reforms all have a tax expenditure of $35
billion under current law.
Table 2 also shows the interaction between the deduction and other tax code
provisions. If there had been no AMT patch in 2004, the tax expenditure associated with
eliminating deductibility would have been reduced by $10 billion, roughly 15 percent.
The next column shows clearly how the AMT reduces the value of deductibility raising
the tax expenditure by nearly $10 billion. The AMT reduces the value of the state and
local tax deduction considerably. In the absence of an AMT patch, imposing the AMT
reduces the value of the deduction by over one-quarter. Finally, the Bush tax cuts also
reduced the value of the deduction substantially with a reduction for 2004 of roughly 20
percent. Unlike the AMT, however, the value of the deduction is reduced not by
disallowing the deduction but rather by lowering marginal tax rates. A similar pattern
holds for the alternatives to eliminating deductibility.
IV.

Distributional Analysis
How are the benefits of deductibility distributed across taxpayer groups? In this

section, I report both income and geographic measures of the benefits of the deduction.
For the income analysis, I use cash income to sort taxpayers. Cash income equals
adjusted gross income less state and local tax refunds plus adjustments to income, MSA
and Keogh deductions, tax-exempt interest and non-taxable Social Security benefits. The
distributional impact is measured by taking weighted averages across the 150,000 returns
in the 2004 Public Use File at different income deciles.8

8

Cut-offs for the deciles in cash income are $5,440, $11,365, $17,340, $23,898, $31,960, $41,730,
$53,710, $70,831, and $100,973. The 95th percentile cut-off is $140,381 and the 99th percentile cut-off is
$343,872.

8

Table 3 presents the change in average tax liability for different income groups if
deductibility were eliminated. The increase in average tax liability is below $100 for the
bottom 60 percent of the income distribution. The tenth decile faces an average increase
of $3,238. Considerable skew occurs in this top decile as evidenced by the mean
exceeding the increase in tax liability for the 75th percentile. Breaking down the top
decile a bit further, the largest increases occur in the top one percent of the distribution.
As a percentage of cash income, the increase in tax liability is quite small – less than one
percent for the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution. Eliminating this deduction
does add progressivity to the tax system as the liability as a percentage of cash income
rises monotonically with income. The last column of Table 3 shows that the share of
returns facing higher taxes goes up steadily with income.
A second reform possibility is to eliminate deductibility for a subset of state and
local taxes. Table 4 and 5 provide distributional impacts of these reforms. More revenue
is collected (ignoring behavioral responses) by eliminating the deduction for income and
personal property taxes than property taxes. Moreover, eliminating the income and
personal property tax deductions adds more progressivity to the tax code than does
eliminating the property tax deduction.
As an alternative to eliminating deductibility altogether, I consider three
possibilities: replacing the deduction with a 15 percent tax credit; placing a cap on
deductions; and allowing deductions above a floor. Table 6 provides distributional
results for shifting from the current deduction to the 15 percent credit. This reform raises
substantially less revenue than other reforms in part because households who take the
standard deduction are allowed to take the credit. Thus this reform lowers tax liability for
some households though as Table 6 indicates the reductions are quite modest. Fewer

9

taxpayers face higher tax bills than occurs if deductibility is eliminated altogether and the
average change in tax liability is less than one-half of one percent of cash income.
Compared to eliminating deductibility, this reform is less progressive.
Deductions can be capped in several ways. I present results for a $5,000 cap and
a cap set at 3.5 percent of AGI. The tax expenditure estimate for both of these reforms is
$35.0 billion in 2004. Tables 7 and 8 illustrate the trade-offs in the two approaches. The
dollar based cap reform is more progressive than the AGI percentage cap reform.
Capping the deduction as a percentage of AGI increases the tax liability more for the
lower 90 percent of the income distribution than capping the deduction at $5,000. The
AGI based cap, however, leads to lower tax increases than does the dollar based cap for
the top 5 percent of the income distribution.
Allowing a deduction above a floor is analyzed in Tables 9 and 10. In contrast to
the cap approach, the dollar based floor reform is less progressive than the AGI
percentage based floor reform. Comparing the dollar based cap and floor, the cap reform
is more progressive than the floor reform. The dollar based floor approach preserves an
incentive gain for state and local spending at the cost of some progressivity. The AGI
approach comparison is more mixed. Except for the top 1 percent of the distribution, the
floor reform is more progressive than the cap reform.
Table 11 presents some distributional information across states. This table reports
the average increase in tax liability by state from eliminating deductibility in dollar terms
and as a percent of income. The average increase per return in the U.S. is $473. Several
states have increases in excess of $700 (NJ, CT, MA, MD, DC, NY) while other states
see average increases of less than $200 (TN, MS, SD, WV, WY). On a percentage basis,

10

NJ, MD, CT, MA, DC, NY, and OR have increases of 0.6 percent of income or more
while AR, LA, TN, MS, SD, WV have increases that are 0.1 percent of income.
Tables 12 through 17 consider how changes in the tax code affect the distribution
of tax expenditures for various reform proposals. In Table 12, I consider eliminating all
deductions for state and local taxes assuming no AMT patch, no AMT, and no Bush tax
cuts, all in 2004. The pattern of increased taxes from eliminating the deduction is not
surprising given the aggregate estimate of the tax expenditure in Table 1. A few
interesting facts emerge. First, the AMT patch in 2004 increases the regressivity of the
deduction with most of the impact occurring in the top decile. This point is reinforced by
a comparison of the Current distribution with the No AMT distribution. In the absence of
the AMT the state and local tax deduction is more regressive, again with nearly all the
increased regressivity occurring in the top 5 percent of the income distribution. Second,
the Bush tax cuts also served to reduce the regressivity of this deduction. Unlike in the
AMT case, the change in tax burden is spread over more deciles. Similar patterns occur
for the other potential reforms of the deduction.
These distributional results hold behavior constant. I next turn to a
reconsideration of the behavioral impacts of ending deductibility of state and local taxes.
While the results from this analysis can't be used to compute new distributional tables,
they are informative about the revenue impact of ending or otherwise modifying
deductibility.
V.

Empirical Analysis of Behavioral Response to the Deduction
State and local governments choose their mix of revenue instruments as well as

the level of spending knowing that taxpayers in their state may be able to deduct some of
these taxes on their federal return. This exporting of state and local taxes to the federal

11

government lowers the political cost of raising revenue at the sub-federal level. How do
state and local governments respond to this feature of the federal tax code? I measure
this response by following the empirical strategy of Feldstein and Metcalf (1987) and
estimating regressions of state and local deductible taxes, non-deductible taxes, and ownsource revenue where I control for the impact of federal deductibility. In contrast to this
previous analysis, I employ panel data from 1979 through 2001, excluding 2000.9
Where calendar year data are matched with fiscal year data, the calendar year data for the
beginning of the fiscal year are used. Thus for state and local data for FY 1998, calendar
year data from 1997 are used. This reflects the fact that decisions about fiscal structure
are set at the beginning of the fiscal year which occurs in the previous calendar year.
The key tax variable is the tax price for state and local tax deductions. This is the
reduction in federal and state taxes arising from an additional dollar of tax deduction. As
a simple example of the concept, consider a taxpayer whose federal tax bracket is 25
percent. Further assume that federal taxes are not deductible at the state level. In that
case, an additional $100 of state tax deductions will reduce federal tax liability by $25.
The net cost of raising this $100 of state taxes is only $75 as $25 has been exported to the
federal government through deductibility. If mi is the ith taxpayer's federal marginal tax
bracket, then this taxpayer's tax price (Pi) for state and local deductible taxes is
(1)

Pi = 1 – mi.

This assumes that the taxpayer itemizes her deductions. The tax price for a non-itemizer
is one. Let di be a dummy variable equally one for an itemizer and zero for a nonitemizer. Then this taxpayer's tax price is

9

State and local fiscal data are from the Bureau of the Census, Federal, State, and Local Governments
webpage at http://www.census.gov/govs/www/estimate.html. Data were accessed in July, 2007. State
level data are not available for FY 2000.

12

(2)

Pi = di(1-mi) + (1-di) = 1 – dimi.

If federal taxes can be deducted at the state level, then the formula for the tax price is
slightly more complicated:
Pi = 1 −

(3)

(

)

(

)

miF 1 − miS + miS 1 − miF
.
1 − miF miS

While this is a formidable looking equation, the NBER's TAXSIM calculator can
compute these tax prices easily. TAXSIM is a computer tax model of the federal and
state tax codes covering federal and state tax codes from 1977 to 2006.10
I estimate regressions of the following form:
(4)

Yit = β 1 Pit + X it β 2 + α i + γ t + ε it

where i indexes states and t indexes years. The dependent variable is some function of
deductible state and local taxes, non-deductible state and local taxes and fees, or own
source revenue. I will report regressions where the dependent variable is the fiscal
variable relative to personal income or the log of the fiscal variable. In the latter case, the
log of income is included as a regressor. The 1 by k vector, Xit, contains variables that
help explain the dependent variable. These must vary within states over time given the
inclusion of state-specific fixed effects and year dummies. State-specific fixed effects are
included to control for unobserved attributes of a state that affect fiscal structure and are
likely correlated with explanatory variables.11 Year dummies provide a flexible
framework for controlling for aggregate shocks to state and local tax systems and
spending.

10

See Feenberg and Coutts (1993) for a description of TAXSIM. Equation (3) is not exactly correct as it
does not account for the phase out of itemized deductions that began in 2000 or the Alternative Minimum
Tax. TAXSIM takes these provisions of the tax code into account when computing tax prices.
11
See Holtz-Eakin (1986) for a discussion of biases arising from not controlling for fixed effects in state
and local government fiscal structure regressions.

13

As pointed out by Feldstein and Metcalf (1987), OLS regressions run on equation
(4) are likely to provide biased estimates of the coefficient on the tax price variable. This
is most easily seen by considering equation (2). Consider a shock that increases state
income tax collections. This increases the deduction available to the tax payer with two
opposing effects. The first effect is that an increase in the potential state tax deduction
increases the likelihood that a taxpayer will itemize on her federal tax return. This
induces a negative correlation between the error term ( ε it ) and the tax price Pit and biases
the OLS estimate of β 1 down. The second effect is that an increase in deductions could
push the tax payer into a lower tax bracket lowering mit. This induces a positive
correlation between the error term and the tax price and biases the OLS estimate of β 1
up. Which effect dominates is an empirical question.
To control for endogeneity, I construct three instruments. The first is a synthetic
instrument that attributes to each household the national probability of itemizing based on
number of dependents (0, 1, 2+) and AGI group. I divide households into one of eight
equally sized AGI groups.12 The instrument for taxpayer i in year t is
(5)

dˆit ( Depit = j , AGI Class it = k ) = d tN ( j , k )

where dNt(j, k) is the probability of itemizing in the national sample in year t for
households with j dependents in AGI class k.
The second instrument is constructed by setting the ith taxpayer's state and local
tax deductions to zero and computing the change in tax liability resulting from a marginal
increase in wage income. Call this marginal tax rate mit0 . The instrument is called a first
dollar tax price and equals

12

The cut points for the AGI groups vary across years to maintain equally sized groups.

14

(6)

Pit0 = 1 − dˆit mit0 .

The third instrument is constructed by replacing the taxpayer's state and local tax
deductions with national averages based on number of dependents and AGI class and
then computing the change in tax liability resulting from a marginal increase in wage
income. Call this marginal tax rate mitL . The last dollar tax price equals
(7)

PitL = 1 − dˆit mitL .
Table 18 shows summary statistics for the variables I use in the regressions.

Deductible taxes average 5.8 percent of personal income, ranging from 1.9 to 11.8
percent. Nondeductible taxes and fees average 8.9 percent of personal income and show
a wider range across states and time. Own source revenue is the sum of these two
variables averaging 14.7 percent of personal income. In addition to the tax price variable,
I include demographic data on percentage young (age 17 and under) and old (age 65 and
older). These two demographic groups are important drivers of demands for state and
local public services, especially at the local level.13 The change in the unemployment
rate is included to control for state-specific economic shocks not captured by state or year
effects. The next set of variables captures features of the distribution of income in the
state that could affect the demand for revenue as well as the tax mix. They also control
for non-linear income effects that the tax price variable might otherwise be proxying for.
Finally, I include information about the share of households married in the state.
Table 19 presents regression results for personal deductible taxes. Column (1)
presents an OLS regression of non-business deductible taxes on the tax price variable and
other control variables. Before discussing the tax price coefficient, let me discuss some
13

It is possible that state tax structure can affect the age distribution of populations living in a state. This is
an interesting issue that I do not pursue in this paper. I thank Roger Gordon for pointing this out. Tax
price results are insensitive to excluding these variables.

15

of the other variables. The coefficient on the AGI range variables are positive with the
coefficient on fr25 and fr100 statistically significant. As might be expected the
coefficient on fr100 is substantially larger than the coefficient on fr25 or fr50. This
pattern holds in general for the other regressions on non-business deductible taxes. The
AGI variance and skew variables never come in statistically significant in these
regressions indicating that once controlling for shares of AGI in various income groups,
other distribution statistics do not affect the choice of these taxes. The form of income
also has little impact on the level of this tax. The coefficient on capagi is statistically
significant in all regressions though the estimated elasticity (not reported) is quite small.
States with a large share of young children or elderly people tend to have lower
reliance on personal deductible taxes though only the coefficient on the share of young
children is statistically significant. The coefficient on the elderly share likely reflects a
demand for lower overall spending by the elderly. The coefficient on the child share is a
bit puzzling since this should correlate with a demand for school spending. Contrary to
the finding in Metcalf (1993), increases in the unemployment rate are associated with a
greater reliance on personal deductible taxes.
The coefficient on the tax price variable equals -2.57 and is highly statistically
significant. The elasticity at the mean equals -4.1 suggesting that tax structure is highly
responsive to changes in the tax price. We must be cautious about this estimate given the
potential endogeneity discussed above. The next regression in Table 19 presents two
stage least squares estimates of the coefficients controlling for the endogeneity in the tax
price variable with the instruments described above. The first stage regression (not
reported here) has a high R2 with an F statistic on the joint significance of the instruments
highly significant. In the second stage regression (column (2)) the coefficient estimate on

16

the tax price variable increases in absolute value from -2.57 to -2.72. The upward bias in
the OLS estimate suggests that the tax bracket bias outweighs the itemization bias. While
the coefficient is less precisely estimated, it is still statistically significant at the 1 percent
level. The elasticity at the mean of the reliance on deductible taxes with respect to the tax
price is -4.3.
The next regression excludes other explanatory variables except for the AGI share
variables, the change in unemployment rate and the population demographic variables.
The two stage least squares estimate rises slightly from -2.72 to -2.84 and continues to be
highly statistically significant.14 The tax price elasticity at the mean from this regression
equals -4.5. As in all other two-stage least squares regressions that I run, the first stage
regressions fit quite well and provide no evidence of problems arising from weak
instruments.
I also report regressions for a log specification where the dependent variable is the
ln of deductible taxes. In addition to the AGI share variables, I include the log of income
in the regression. The tax price coefficient in the two-stage least squares regressions
continues to have the expected sign but is not statistically significant in the full regressors
specification and only significant at the 10 percent level in the restricted specification
and the elasticity of revenues with respect to the tax price is lower than the elasticity
implied by the levels regressions.
The pattern of results from the levels and log regressions are quite similar to the
those of Feldstein and Metcalf (1987). The levels regressions tend to suggest higher

14

Which variables I choose to exclude has little impact on the coefficient estimates. If I drop all variables
except the year dummies, the estimated tax price coefficient equals -4.70 with a standard error of 0.52. If I
drop all other variables including the year dummies, the estimated tax price coefficient rises to -5.90 with a
standard error of 0.20. Excluding year effects likely biases the coefficient estimate down. Adverse
aggregate shocks reduce state income tax revenue and are likely to push taxpayers into lower tax brackets
thereby raising their tax price.

17

elasticities at the means and have a higher level of statistical significance than the
coefficients arising from the log regressions.15
If changes in the tax mix occur in response to changes in the deductibility of state
and local taxes, then we should see an increase in the use of non-deductible taxes and
fees in response to an increase in the tax price for state and local taxes. I explore this in
Table 20. The format of the table is the same as Table 19. Column (1) presents results
from an OLS regression using the full set of explanatory variables. The coefficient on the
tax price variable is positive as would be expected if tax shifting from deductible taxes to
non-deductible taxes and fees were occurring but the coefficient estimate is not
statistically significant. The AGI share variables suggest that states with a large share of
tax filers with AGI of at least $100,000 rely less on non-deductible taxes and fees, a
result consistent with the results in Table 19 and quite plausible given the higher value of
the deduction to high tax-bracket filers.
Once I instrument for the tax price variable (column (2)), the coefficient on this
variable increases to 2.34 and is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. As in the
OLS regression, states with a high share of high income households tend to prefer
deductible to non-deductible taxes with the coefficient on fr100 substantially larger in
this regression. The elasticity at the mean for the tax price variable is 2.46 confirming the
finding from the Table 19 regressions that tax swapping is quite sensitive to changes in
the tax price for state and local tax deductions. Using the restricted set of regressors, the
coefficient estimate rises to 3.04 and continues to be highly statistically significant. Now
the elasticity at the mean is 3.2. The log regressions also confirm the tax shifting result
15

One might be concerned that my AGI distribution variables do not entirely control for income effects
and that the tax price variable continues to pick up some income effects. Income is explicitly included in
the log regressions. I experimented with adding AGI to the ratio regressions and the results are not
affected.

18

though the two-stage least squares estimate with the full set of regressors is only
statistically significant at the 10 percent level. For the regression with restricted set of
regressors, the p-value of the coefficient estimate is .04.
Tables 19 and 20 have focused on how state and local governments choose their
mix of taxes and fees. I now turn to the impact of deductibility on own source revenue.
The first column of Table 21 reports an OLS regression of the ratio of own source
revenue to personal income on the full set of regressors. By this regression, the
deduction leads to a substantial increase in reliance on own source revenue by state and
local governments. However, the result goes away once I instrument for the tax price
variable (column (2)). The estimated coefficient on the tax price variable is -0.38 but not
statistically significant. Of the other variables, the demographic variables have the most
substantial impact. States with a higher share of elderly, in particular, have substantially
lower levels of own source revenue. The elasticity at the means for this regressor equals
-0.55 and is the largest elasticity among all the regressors in this specification.
Results are robust to the specification form. Restricting the regressors in the
levels regression changes the point estimate on the tax price variable to 0.20 but it is still
not statistically significant. The regression estimate is negative in both log specifications
but again neither large nor statistically significant.
Summarizing, deductibility appears to have little impact on the overall level of
own source revenue at the state and local level. But it does appear to have an effect on
the mix of revenues with a greater reliance on the income and personal property tax and
lesser reliance on non-deductible taxes and fees.
The Treasury tax expenditure estimate for state and local tax deductibility equaled
$65 billion in fiscal year 2004. Let's consider the implications of the regression estimates

19

for eliminating deductibility in that year. The average marginal tax price for deductible
taxes in calendar year 2003 was 94.3. Consider the regression estimates from the ratio
regression with restricted number of regressors. This implies that removing deductibility
will reduce deductible taxes per thousand dollars of personal income by 2.8 times the
change in tax price. Nondeductible taxes and charges per thousand dollars of personal
income are predicted to rise by 3.0 times the change in tax price. Finally own-source
revenue per $1000 of personal income is predicted to rise by 0.2 times the change in tax
price. Personal income in calendar year 2003 was $9.15 trillion. The regression
estimates imply that removing deductibility leads to a reduction in deductible taxes of
$146 billion. Non-deductible taxes and fees increase by $156 billion and own-source
revenue rises by $10 billion.
The increase in non-deductible taxes and fees more than offsets the decline in
deductible taxes. If these non-deductible taxes and fees were entirely paid by corporate
businesses, then corporate income tax collections would fall by $55 billion, 84 percent of
the value of the tax expenditure arising from removing deductibility. This assumes a 35
percent rate applied to these increased taxes and fees. The calculation does not factor in
any lost tax revenues from reductions in dividends paid or capital gains. It also does not
allow for the possibility that some of the cost is shifted to workers in the form of lower
wages or consumers in the form of higher prices. In the former case, the relevant tax rate
would be that on wage earnings while if the latter, no revenue loss occurs.16

16

I also computed revenue losses from the restricted log regressions (last columns of Tables 19-21). The
impacts on deductible taxes, non-deductible taxes and fees, and own-source revenue from ending
deductibility are not internally consistent across the three regressions since the log of own-source revenue
is not equal to the sum of the logs of the two revenue sources. If I assume that the impact on own-source
revenue is zero (the own-source regression predicts a $6 billion fall, a decline of less than one-half of one
percent), I can estimate the revenue impact either from the regression in Table 19 or Table 20. Using the
estimate from the deductible tax regression, the offset from corporate tax collections (assuming businesses
pay the entire increase in non-deductible taxes and fees) is $30 billion, just under half the reported tax

20

In reality not all of the non-deductible taxes are paid by corporations. It can not
be determined from an inspection of the components of these taxes and fees what the
burden would be on corporate taxable income from a removal of deductibility. Current
collections reflect the average burden. What determines the revenue loss is the marginal
change in tax instruments arising from an end to deductibility. But regardless, it appears
that the tax expenditure estimate that ignores the behavioral response at the state and
local level leads to quite possibly a substantial overestimate of the revenue benefits of
eliminating deductibility.
VI.

Conclusion
The deduction for state and local taxes has been in the income tax since its

modern inception. It is justified by some proponents as an important subsidy for state
and local spending on the grounds that it increases spending on public goods that would
otherwise be underfunded. While I do not assess the argument that state and local
government spending is on public goods and therefore likely to be underfunded, the
empirical evidence is that the tax deduction does not lead to increased state and local
spending. In fact the empirical evidence is mixed with some estimates suggesting more
spending and others less. None of the IV estimates, however, are statistically significant.
The evidence is compelling, however, that deductibility affects the mix of revenue
instruments chosen at the state and local level. Deductibility leads to a greater reliance
on income and property taxes and a lower reliance on non-deductible taxes and fees.
Because these non-deductible taxes and fees are a cost for businesses, some of the
revenue that would arise from eliminating this deduction would be lost through declines

expenditure loss from ending deductibility. If I use the estimate from the regression in Table 20, the offset
is $107 billion, roughly two-thirds larger than the estimated tax expenditure.

21

in corporate and business tax income. The revenue loss offset to the measured tax
expenditure could be quite substantial.
Distributional analysis suggests that the tax deduction is quite regressive.
Moreover the value of the subsidy varies considerably across states. Alternatives to
eliminating this deduction that I considered include capping the deduction, setting a floor
on the deduction, and replacing it with a 15 percent tax credit. The cap and floor reforms
are intermediate options that raise about one-half the revenue that is raised by eliminating
the deduction (ignoring behavioral offsets). Replacing the deduction with a 15 percent
tax credit raises the least amount of revenue before behavioral responses since some
people are now eligible for the credit who take the standard deduction and so do not
benefit from the deduction. In terms of adding progressivity to the tax code, the tax
credit has at best a modest impact in large part due to the smaller amount of revenue
raised under this reform. Capping the deduction as a percentage of AGI is less
progressive than capping it with a dollar based cap. In contrast, the AGI percentage
based floor reform is more progressive than a dollar based floor reform.
This paper has shown that the tax system can be made more progressive if the
deduction for state and local taxes is eliminated or curtailed. The regression results also
suggest that the deduction is ineffective at increasing own source spending at the subfederal level. It may be that the deduction encourages a shift in spending from certain
programs to other areas. This remains an interesting topic for future research.
