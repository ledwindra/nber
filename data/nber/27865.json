    "abstract": "\n\nIn June 2020, we surveyed 2,516 Americans regarding their preferences for both short- and long-term expansions to government-provided healthcare and unemployment insurance programs. We find that support for such programs is positively associated with (a) COVID-19 deaths and infections in the respondent\u2019s county, (b) the pandemic-induced change in the unemployment rate in the respondent\u2019s county, and (c) survey elicitations of the respondent\u2019s perceptions of COVID-19\u2019s consequences. These associations persist when controlling for pre-COVID-19 political ideology and demographics. These results suggest that real or perceived exposure to COVID-19\u2019s consequences has influenced support for expansions to the U.S. safety-net system.\n\n",
