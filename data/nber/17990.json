    "abstract": "\n\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) targeted substantial School Improvement Grants (SIGs) to the nation's \"persistently lowest achieving\" public schools (i.e., up to $2 million per school annually over 3 years) but required schools accepting these awards to implement a federally prescribed school-reform model. Schools that met the \"lowest-achieving\" and \"lack of progress\" thresholds within their state had prioritized eligibility for these SIG-funded interventions. Using data from California, this study leverages these two discontinuous eligibility rules to identify the effects of SIG-funded whole-school reforms. The results based on these \"fuzzy\" regression-discontinuity designs indicate that there were significant improvements in the test-based performance of schools on the \"lowest-achieving\" margin but not among schools on the \"lack of progress\" margin. Complementary panel-based estimates suggest that these improvements were largely concentrated among schools adopting the federal \"turnaround\" model, which compels more dramatic staff turnover.\n\n",
