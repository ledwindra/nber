Maximum likelihood estimation which ignores this heteroskedasticity yields inconsistent estimates of the variance-covariance matrix and renders likelihood ratio tests of the restrictions of consumer demand theory inappropriate. A heteroskedasticity-consistent estimator of the variance-covariance matrix is proposed by adopting the technique of White (1980) to the case at hand.\n\n",
