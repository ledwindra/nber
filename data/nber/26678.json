    "abstract": "\n\nWhat is the impact of regulatory reforms that enhance credit market efficiency on children\u2019s human capital? Using a parent-child panel dataset, we find that such reforms reduced children\u2019s academic performance in low-income families. Consistent with the view that financial development entices low-income parents to substitute out of childrearing and into employment with adverse effects on children\u2019s education, we find that among low-income families, regulatory reforms: increased mother\u2019s employment hours, reduced parental supervision and parent-child discussions about school and college, and had bigger adverse effects when mothers were not already working full-time and grandparents were not living with the child.\n\n",
