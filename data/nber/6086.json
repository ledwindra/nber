When contracts can be renegotiated, a well-known danger is that the principal can hold up the agent, undermining the agent's investment incentives.  We begin by identifying a countervailing effect: Investment by the agent can increase his value for the asset, thus improving his bargaining position in renegotiation.  We show that option contracts will achieve the first best whenever this threat-point effect dominates the holdup effect.  Otherwise, achieving the first best is difficult and, in many cases, impossible.  In such cases, we show that if parties have an appropriate signal available, then the first best is still attainable for a wide class of bargaining procedures.  A noisy signal, however, means that the optimal contract will involve terms that courts might view as punitive and so refuse to enforce.\n\n",
