    "abstract": "\n\nWe study a propaganda campaign sponsored by the government against the main political challenger in the days preceding the 2015 Argentine runoff presidential election. Subjects in the treatment group watched an \u201cad\u201d initially aired during soccer transmissions that was part of this campaign and were then asked about their political views. Relative to subjects in the control group, their declared preference for the challenger drops by 6.5 percentage points. We find no effects of the three types of defenses employed by the challenger (a positive message unrelated to the \u201cad\u201d, an answer to the accusations in the \u201cad\u201d, and a counter-attack). The propaganda effect is driven by women.\n\n",

None of the authors participated in the 2015 political campaign. Galiani was Secretary of Economic Policy of the Treasury in the Macri administration during 2017-2018, while Nicolas Dujovne served as Treasury Minister (2017-2019). In November 2015, Dujovne was a co-owner of the consulting company that generated the data for this study.
