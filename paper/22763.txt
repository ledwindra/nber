ABSTRACT
In this paper, we develop a new model for government cost-benefit analysis in the presence of
risk. In our model, a benevolent government chooses the scale of a risky project in the presence
of two key frictions. First, there are market failures, which cause the government to perceive
project payoffs differently than private households do. This gives the government a "social risk
management" motive: projects that ameliorate market failures when household marginal utility is
high are appealing. The second friction is that government financing is costly because of tax
distortions. This creates a "fiscal risk management" motive: incremental spending that occurs
when total government spending is already high is particularly unattractive. A first key insight is
that the government's need to manage fiscal risk frequently limits its capacity for managing social
risk. A second key insight is that fiscal risk and social risk interact in complex ways. When
considering many potential projects, government cost-benefit analysis thus acquires the flavor of
a portfolio choice problem. We use the model to explore how the relative attractiveness of two
technologies for promoting financial stability—bailouts and regulation—varies with the
government's fiscal burden and characteristics of the economy.

Introduction

In modern economies, a signi…cant fraction of economy-wide risk is borne indirectly by taxpayers via the government. Governments have signi…cant liabilities associated with retirement bene…ts, social insurance programs, and …nancial system backstops. These liabilities
are large: the amount of credit risk explicitly recognized on the balance sheet of the U.S. federal government now exceeds $3 trillion, and implicit or o¤-balance sheet liabilities are even
larger. For instance, o¤-balance sheet guarantees on mortgage-backed securities account for
another $7 trillion. Moreover, the risk associated with the government’s contingent liabilities
is not idiosyncratic but varies systematically with economic conditions. For example, during
the …nancial crisis, total o¤-balance sheet …nancial system backstops temporarily reached
more than $6 trillion (Geithner [2014]). In addition, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio rose from
38% to 72% between 2007 and 2013 due to falling tax revenue and increasing expenditures
on government programs that automatically expand in a recession.
Given the magnitude of these exposures, the set of risks the government chooses to bear
and the way it manages those risks is of great importance. A vast literature in public economics studies the costs and bene…ts of various government programs such as unemployment
insurance and social security (Baily [1978], Chetty [2006]). An equally vast literature studies
optimal government …nancing policies— i.e., taxation and government debt management—
that minimize costly distortions, holding …xed the set of programs the government wishes to
undertake (Ramsey [1927], Diamond and Mirrless [1971], Mirrless [1971], Sandmo [1975]). In
this paper, we bridge the gap between these two literatures, emphasizing the ways that government …nancing frictions impact the set of projects the government should undertake. The
result is a ‡exible framework for conducting cost-bene…t analysis in a stochastic environment
where the government faces …nancing frictions.
In our model, the government chooses the scale of a program— designed to correct a
speci…c market failure— whose social bene…ts and …scal costs ‡uctuate over time and across
states of the world. Our setup di¤ers from the Ricardian framework, where the government
is a veil for taxpayers, in two critical ways. First, we assume that government programs can
generate social bene…ts that private actors are unable to generate on their own. While we
model these social bene…ts in reduced form, we think of them as arising from the fact that
the government often has unique technologies for addressing market failures. For instance,
the government may be able to use price or quantity regulations to correct technological
externalities (Weitzman [1974]) or pecuniary externalities in incomplete markets (Greenwald
and Stiglitz [1986]), enforce contributions to address free-rider problems in the provision of
1

public goods (Samuelson [1954]), or mandate participation to address market-unravelling
issues (Rothschild and Stiglitz [1976]). Second, we assume that lump-sum taxation is not
feasible and that the government can only raise tax revenue by levying proportional taxes that
create deadweight e¢ ciency losses (Ramsey [1927], Diamond and Mirrlees [1971], Mirrlees
[1971], Saez [2001]). Speci…cally, we assume that the government raises revenue through
an income tax that distorts the labor supply of households. As a result, each dollar of tax
revenue the government raises costs society more than a dollar in pre-tax resources.
These two key frictions drive a rich set of interactions. In choosing the program’s scale,
the government has a “social risk management” motive: programs that generate large net
bene…ts are attractive, particularly if those bene…ts accrue in recessions, when household
marginal utility is high. An important subtlety that arises here is that the government
cannot take marginal utility as given: by operating large programs, the government a¤ects
aggregate consumption and thus household utility. In addition, the fact that taxation is
distortionary gives rise to a “…scal risk management” motive: programs requiring large
outlays are unattractive, particularly if those outlays tend to occur when spending on other
government programs is elevated.
A …rst key insight to emerge from the model is that the government’s need to manage …scal
risk frequently limits its capacity for managing social risk. We illustrate this idea using a
numerical example of a single program: deposit insurance. In the example, deposit insurance
is a social hedge, albeit one that is …scally risky: we assume it generates large social bene…ts,
raising output by preventing bank runs during recessions, but it also involves potentially
large government outlays in the same bad states. The example highlights how the two risk
management motives come into con‡ict. Most directly, because deposit insurance involves
large government outlays and hence greater tax distortions in bad times, it creates additional
…scal risk. This reduces the government’s desire to use deposit insurance to manage social
risk, particularly when tax distortions are large or when the pre-existing …scal burden is
high.
Indeed, we show that the social and …scal risk management motives typically pull in
opposite directions as we vary the parameters of the economy or the program under consideration. For example, an increase in the volatility of exogenous private income makes
deposit insurance more attractive from a social risk management standpoint: the value of
preventing bank runs in bad times increases as marginal utility becomes more volatile. On
the other hand, an increase in the volatility of private income also raises the volatility of tax
rates, increasing …scal risk. This tends to reduce the attractiveness of an expansive deposit

2

insurance regime.
We then extend our framework to consider the case where the government must simulataneously choose the scales of multiple programs. A second key insight is that neither …scal
risk nor social risk can be judged in isolation. A program’s …scal risk depends on how its
outlays covary with those of other programs. Similarly, a program’s social risk depends, in
part, on how its net bene…ts covary with those of other programs. These interpendencies
imply that government cost-bene…t analysis acquires the ‡avor of a classic portfolio choice
problem (Markowitz [1952], Tobin [1958], Sharpe [1964], Linter [1965]).
We illustrate these portfolio intuitions by considering an example in which the government chooses between a “…scally safe”and a “…scally risky”program for promoting …nancial
stability. Regulation that limits bank risk taking ex ante is a …scally safe program because
the associated expenditures vary little across states of the world. By contrast, bailouts in the
form of ex post guarantees or capital injections are a …scally risky program because the associated government outlays vary enormously across states and may surge in a deep recession.
Since bailouts entail costly increases in taxes or cuts to other programs, the attractiveness
of bailouts versus regulations depends on the government’s other …scal commitments.
When the government’s …scal burden is low, bailouts can be a relatively attractive way to
promote …nancial stability. As the …scal burden rises, it is optimal to substitute toward the
less …scally risky program, regulation. When the …scal burden is high, it may be optimal to
completely eschew bailouts and rely solely on regulation. For instance, if the government is
also committed to a strong social safety net, which already requires large outlays in recessions,
then ex post bailouts become less attractive relative to ex ante guarantees. These conclusions
correspond to the classic portfolio choice intuition that an investor facing a higher level of
“background risk” should choose a more conservative …nancial portfolio (Merton [1973],
Campbell and Viceira [2002]). In addition, we show that when the distortionary costs of
taxation rise, the optimal quantity of …scally risky bailouts falls. This corresponds to the
standard precept that the optimal portfolio allocation to risky assets falls as risk aversion
rises.
Work in public …nance typically considers individual government interventions in isolation. For instance, our paper is related to the public …nance literature that studies the
optimal provision of a single public good when the government must …nance its expenditures
using distortionary taxes. This literature, including Pigou (1947), Stiglitz and Dasgupta
(1971), and Atkinson and Stern (1974), studies a static, deterministic setting. Our model
generalizes this classic public …nance problem to a multi-period, stochastic setting. This

3

allows us to study how risk, both social and …scal, impacts optimal program scale.
The literatures on optimal taxation and government debt management recognize that
government expenditures are stochastic and, assuming that tax-smoothing is imperfect, that
the tax burden will also be stochastic. However, this work typically treats the government
as an exogenously given collection of programs. By contrast, our approach shows that the
cyclicality of government expenditures has important implications for the set of programs
that should be undertaken by the government.
Our model also reveals strong parallels between government cost-bene…t analysis and
modern theories of corporate investment. In our setting, the distortionary costs of taxation
play a similar role to the one that costly external …nance plays in a corporate setting.
Speci…cally, the distortionary costs of taxation can lead the government to behave as though
it is more risk-averse than the taxpayers it represents, just like …nancing frictions can lead
…rms to behave as though they are more risk-averse than shareholders. In a corporate
…nance setting, hedging and risk management activities can enhance …rm value if external
…nancing is costly (Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein [1993]), just as smoothing tax rates and debt
management create value for taxpayers when taxation is distortionary (Barro [1979]). By
the same logic, …nancing frictions have implications for the optimal scale and composition of
government projects in our setting, much as they do for …rm investment (Fazzari, Hubbard,
and Petersen [1988], Kaplan and Zingales [1997], Bolton, Chen, and Wang [2011 and 2013]).
Our paper is also related to the literature on intermediary-based asset pricing (He and
Krishnamurthy [2013], Brunnermeier and Sanikov [2014]). In those models, households indirectly hold …nancial assets via intermediaries. And, because there are frictions between the
household sector and the …nancial sector, the stochastic discount factor that prices …nancial
assets equals households’stochastic discount factors with an adjustment that captures these
intermediation frictions. A similar result obtains in our model because tax distortions mean
that the government perceives a …nancing wedge term between itself and the households it
represents.
The plan for the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we develop the general model and
characterize the optimal scale of a single potentially welfare-improving government program
in the presence of distortionary taxation. We explore several special cases of the general
model that help clarify the key intuitions. Section 3 extends the model to consider portfolios
of multiple government programs. In particular, we explore the choice between a …scally safe
and a …scally risky program for addressing a given market failure. Section 4 concludes.

Model

2.1

Setup

We consider a two-period model with dates t = 0 and 1. At time 0, a benevolent government
chooses the scale of a government program, denoted q, and initial government borrowing D0
to maximize the lifetime expected utility of a representative household.
By correcting a market failure, a government program of scale q generates a social payo¤
Wt (q) at time t, where Wt (0) = 0, Wt0 ( ) > 0, and Wt00 ( )

0. W1 (q) is stochastic, taking on

di¤erent values at time 1 depending on the state of the world. For instance, deposit insurance
may create broad …nancial stability bene…ts that raise private output in bad states at time 1,
implying W1 (q) > 0 in bad states. In contrast, if there are no social bene…ts associated with
the program, then Wt (q) = 0. If the government chooses quantity q of the program, this
requires government outlays of Xt (q) at time t, where Xt (0) = 0, Xt0 ( ) > 0, and Xt00 ( )

0.

Like W1 (q), X` (q) can also be stochastic.
We assume that the government enters time 0 having previously accumulated debt D.
At time 0, the government issues default-free bonds in quantity D0 that must be repaid at
time 1. Letting R denote the gross riskless interest rate of interest between times 0 and 1,
the government’s budget constraints at time 0 and time 1 are
T0 + D0 = G0 + X0 (q) + D

(1)

T1 = G1 + X1 (q) + RD0 .
Tt is tax revenue at time t; Xt (q) is the endogenous level of expenditures associated with
the speci…c program under consideration; Gt represents other exogenous government expenditures not associated with the speci…c program.
A key feature of our setup is that we assume taxation is distortionary. Speci…cally, we
assume that households choose their labor supply `t in period t to maximize period t utility,

Here Yt is the exogenous level of productivity at time t, which we refer to as the “tax base,”

larger. When

raising Tt dollars of tax revenue in terms of household consumption— is equal to the amount
of tax revenue raised plus the deadweight loss: Tt +Yt ( =2)

This implies that the marginal

serving as the numeraire. Thus, Yt ((`t 1 + )
)= (2 ) captures households’disutility from supplying `t
units of labor, and Wt (q) is the additional utility households derive when the government chooses program
scale q. This quasilinear speci…cation for period utility is similar to the one used in Atkinson (1990) and
Diamond (1998). The substance of the assumption in this case is that program bene…ts Wt (q) do not impact
labor supply choices.
2
Because income taxation disincentivizes labor, the government faces a “La¤er curve.” Speci…cally, for a
given Yt , Eq. (3) says that tax revenue is an inverse U-shaped function of the tax rate, which is maximized
when t = 1= (2 ). Since the government will always choose p

to denote the extent to which the marginal cost of public funds exceeds one. In other
words, h0 ( t ) is the marginal deadweight cost of raising additional tax revenue— i.e. the cost
of raising an additional dollar of revenue via distortionary taxation.4 Naturally, we have
h00 ( t ) > 0: the marginal cost of public funds is increasing in the income tax rate because
higher tax rates imply greater labor supply distortions.
The lifetime utility of the representative household is
(7)

U = u (C0 ) + E[u (C1 )],
where 0 <

1, u0 ( ) > 0, and u00 ( )

0. Households choose their bond holdings (B0 )

taking taxes, program scale, and the interest rate as exogenously given. Thus, the Euler
condition for household bond holdings is
u0 (C0 ) = R E [u0 (C1 )] :

(8)

The marginal cost of public funds exceeds one if the elasticity of labor supply with respect to taxes
is negative. In a more general model, the sign of this elasticity is ambiguous. It is the sum of a negative
substitution e¤ect and a positive wealth e¤ect: higher taxes make households poorer and thus motivate them
to work more. Given our quasi-linear speci…cation of per-period utility, there are no wealth e¤ects, and only
the substitution e¤ect is present.

The term (1 2 t ) appears in the denominator of (5) and (6) because the government faces a La¤er
curve. As a result, a given change in required tax revenue has a larger e¤ect on the required tax rate when
the rate is closer to the revenue-maximizing tax rate of 1= (2 ).

Ignoring the non-negativity constraint, the government solves an unconstrained problem
where it recognizes that tax rates and the riskfree rate are implicitly de…ned by Eqs. (11)
and (12).
Examples To make the setup concrete, we brie‡y discuss two government programs as
examples. Internet Appendix A formally maps these two examples into our framework. Our
…rst example builds on Stein (2012) and considers the value of government interventions to
prevent economically destabilizing bank runs on …nancial intermediaries. In Stein’s (2012)
model, intermediaries hold long-term risky assets, which they …nance by issuing short-term
debt. While households value this short-term debt because it is safe and liquid, short-term
…nancing exposes intermediaries to bank runs that can force them to liquidate …nancial assets
in an economic downturn. These asset …re sales have real economic costs because, instead
of investing in new real projects, other savers must use their scarce capital to purchase
liquidated …nancial assets. As a result, …re sales raise the equilibrium hurdle rate on new
real projects and lead to an additional drop in total private output that exacerbates incipient
economic downturns. Because …nancial intermediaries do not internalize this pecuniary
externality, they are overly reliant on short-term …nancing from a social point of view, and
5

The constraint that q
0 re‡ects the fact that the government typically cannot choose a negative
program scale. Thus, our framework can be used to study both the extensive and intensive margins of
government policy.

8

there is scope for welfare-improving government policies.
Consider a program in which the government guarantees the short-term debt of …nancial
intermediaries in order to prevent these socially costly bank runs. The government outlays
associated with this guarantee program (X) are the realized …scal costs of the guarantees net
of any insurance premia paid by …nancial intermediaries. Thus, outlays would be positive in
states of the world where …nancial intermediaries su¤er large losses on their risky assets and
the government has to make short-term creditors whole. The social payo¤ (W ) from this
program is the gain in net private income that stems from the fact that stopping bank runs
allows savers to use their capital for productive new projects, net of any output that is lost
due to moral hazard distortions.
Our second example is unemployment insurance. Consider the Rothschild-Stiglitz (1976)
model in which two types of agents have di¤erent probabilities of becoming unemployed.
When agents know their types and insurers do not, a competitive equilibrium in which
di¤erent types pool together cannot exist: insurers will always …nd it pro…table to o¤er an
insurance contract that appeals only to low-risk types. In the separating equilibrium that
may or may not exist, agents with a low probability of future unemployment must be less
than fully insured in order to prevent high-risk agents from mimicking them and purchasing
cheap insurance. This candidate separating equilibrium will not exist— indeed no competitive
equilibrium exists and the insurance market will completely shutdown— when low-risk types
…nd it costly to separate from high-risk types (or …nd it attractive to pool with high-risk
types).
A government-run mandatory insurance program can lead to a Pareto improvement by
enforcing pooling. The social payo¤ W from a mandatory insurance program is the welfare
gain associated with the move from the separating equilibrium (or, when no equilibrium
exists, from an outcome with no insurance) to the pooling outcome, again, net of any moral
hazard distortions.6 As in the previous example, the net government outlay X is the difference between government insurance payouts and insurance premia collected (i.e., payroll
taxes).
Discussion of model setup Several features of the model setup deserve discussion. First,
we adopt a representative agent perspective, assuming that the social bene…ts of any program
accrue to a representative household. However, if market failures create scope for government
6

See Baily (1978) and Chetty (2006) for classic examinations of the trade-o¤ between the insurance
bene…ts and moral hazard costs of social insurance programs.

9

policies to generate Pareto improvements, a representative agent may fail to exist.7 Thus, in
cases where no representative agent exists, our framework should be viewed as a short-hand
for a setting in which the government maximizes a more complicated social welfare function.
Second, the source of …scal frictions in our model is the incentive distortions stemming
from proportional taxation (Ramsey [1927], Diamond and Mirrlees [1971], Mirrlees [1971],
Saez [2001]). Taken literally, this means that, with lump-sum taxation, there would be no
…scal frictions in our model. More generally, while we refer to distortions h0 ( ) as “tax
distortions,” they are best seen as a short-hand for a host of frictional costs that may arise
when the government faces a signi…cant …scal burden. For instance, there may be costs associated with the risk of sovereign default (Borensztein and Panizza [2009]) or costs associated
with high rates of nominal price in‡ation that are often triggered by large government debt
burdens, as in Leeper’s (1991) …scal theory of the price level.
Third, the setup largely abstracts from the fact that government programs may distort
the behavior of private agents in undesirable ways. For instance, government insurance
programs may create moral hazard problems (Baily [1978], Allen et al [2015]). Conceptually,
these distortionary costs should be folded into the W s, as we noted above in our two examples.
Fourth, while program scale impacts household utility, it does not impact the tax base
in our model. This is an appropriate assumption in the case where the government raises
revenue to produce a classic public good such as public infrastructure or national security.8
However, in other cases, the Wt (q) may add to the tax base. This might be the case for a
…nancial stability program that helps prevent further collapses in private output due to bank
runs. In this case, Eq. (9) should be replaced with Ct = (Yt + Wt (q)) (1

2
)
2 t

and Eq. (3) for tax revenue should be replaced with Tt = (Yt + Wt (q)) (1

Xt (q)
t)

Gt
t:

In

this case, the need to manage …scal risk can reinforce the government’s desire to manage
social risk, partially alleviating the usual tension between …scal and social risk management.
Speci…cally, programs that help to keep the tax base high when Yt falls also help to keep tax
rates and the associated deadweight losses low.
A …nal feature of our set up is that the government makes a one-shot choice about
program scale at time 0 and can credibly commit to this scale at time 1. Thus, the model is
best seen as applying to non-discretionary budgeting where, for reasons of e¢ ciency, fairness,
7

In the case of incomplete markets problems like pollution externalities, a representative agent will typically exist. However, in other cases where market failures are generated by information problems among
heterogeneous agents such as the insurance example above, one may not exist (Huang and Litzenberger
[1988], Du¢ e [2001]).
8
In that case, Wt (q) can be interpreted as household utility from consuming the public good, and Ct is
interpretable as a quasi-linear period utility function with private consumption serving as the numeraire.

10

or political economy, program scale is stable over time.

2.2.1

Optimal government policy
Model solution

We now characterize optimal government policy in the model. We …rst explain how government policies impact the riskless interest rate R. We then turn to the optimality conditions
for government borrowing D0 before …nally solving for the optimal program scale q:
1

When households are risk-neutral, R =

irrespective of the government’s choices of

00

q and D0 . If households are risk averse (u ( ) < 0), however, @R=@q will be non-zero: the
scale of the program impacts the interest rate. Speci…cally, we have
@R
=
@q

R E [u00 (C1 ) (W10 (q) X 01 (q) (1 + h0 ( 1 )))] u00 (C0 ) (W00 (q) X 00 (q) (1 + h0 ( 0 )))
.
E [u0 (C1 ) RD0 u00 (C1 ) h0 ( 1 )]
(13)

The sign of @R=@q is ambiguous and depends on the nature of the program under consideration. For example, if a program is expected to raise C1 relative to C0 ,9 households will want
to borrow more at time 0 to smooth consumption, causing the interest rate to rise. On the
other hand, if a program is expected to lower C1 relative to C0 , doing more of the program
will lower the interest rate.
If households are risk-averse and taxation is distortionary, @R=@D0 will be non-zero.
Speci…cally, we have
@R R2 E [u00 (C1 ) h0 ( 1 )] +u00 (C0 ) h0 ( 0 )
=
@D0
E [u0 (C1 ) RD0 u00 (C1 ) h0 ( 1 )]

0.

(14)

The intuition is straightforward. When taxes are distortionary (h0 ( ) > 0), borrowing more
today lowers current taxes and tax distortions, thereby raising current consumption. It also
raises future taxes and tax distortions, lowering future consumption in expectation. When
u00 ( ) < 0, this means that current marginal utility (u0 (C0 )) falls and future marginal utility
(u0 (C1 )) rises in expectation. As a result, households want to save more at time 0, so R
must fall.
With these two comparative statics in hand, we now turn to optimal borrowing at time
9

This would be the case if, for instance, we had W0 = X0 = 0, E [W10 (q)
Cov [u00 (C1 ) ; (W10 (q) X10 (q) (1 + h0 ( 1 )))] = 0:

11

X10 (q) (1 + h0 ( 1 ))] > 0, and

0. The …rst order condition for D0 can be written as
u0 (C0 ) h0 ( 0 ) =

R + D0

@R
@D0

E [u0 (C1 ) h0 ( 1 )] .

(15)

To understand this condition, suppose the government issues more debt D0 at time 0 and
reduces taxes T0 by the same small amount. This deviation reduces tax distortions by h0 ( 0 )
at time 0, which raises utility at time 0 by u0 (C0 ) h0 ( 0 ) at the margin. Since this deviation
@R
@R
raises taxes by (R + D0 @D
) at time 1, it raises future tax distortions by (R + D0 @D
)h0 ( 1 )
0
0
@R
at time 1, which lowers discounted expected utility by (R + D0 @D
) E[u0 (C1 ) h0 ( 1 )]. Eq.
0

(15) says that, at an optimum, such a deviation must have zero e¤ect on expected lifetime
utility.
We now turn to the optimal scale of the government program, q. The …rst-order condition
for q is given by
0 = u0 (C0 )

@C0 @C0 @ 0

@q
@ 0 @q

+ E u0 (C1 )

@C1 @C1 @ 1

We can write the e¤ect of changing q on household consumption at times 0 and 1 as:

Expected tax cost

Tax risk premium

We now discuss the four terms in Eq. (19) that impact the optimal scale of a government
program.
The …rst term in Eq. (19) is the expected net marginal bene…t from the government pro-

gram, discounted at the risk-free rate. This term re‡ects the way that the costs of credit and
guarantee programs are accounted for in the Federal budget. Speci…cally, under the Federal
Credit Reform Act (FCRA) of 1990,10 the cost of a guarantee program equals the expected
net present value of government outlays discounted at the risk-free rate. Obviously, the total
net bene…t, equal to the increase in private income (Wt ) minus the cash outlays associated
with the program (Xt ), should be taken into account from a cost-bene…t perspective.
The second term in (19) is the risk premium associated with these net marginal bene…ts
and re‡ects the government’s “social risk management”motive. It is commonly argued— see
e.g., Lucas (2012) and the citations within— that the government should charge the same
risk premium as the private sector because it is acting on behalf of risk-averse tax payers.
Speci…cally, the government should charge a risk premium Cov [M1 ; X10 (q)] for bearing the
risk of cash outlays X1 (q), just as private investors would. However, our model clari…es
that the risk premium should be assessed on the net marginal gain or loss from the program,
W10 (q) X10 (q). For instance, to the extent that the social gains from correcting some market
failure accrue primarily in bad times, the Cov [M1 ; W10 (q)] term will be positive, re‡ecting
the government’s “social risk management”motive.
One subtlety regarding this second term is that the stochastic discount factor M1 itself
10

13

(and therefore risk premia) depends on the scale of the government program q and government borrowing D0 (see Eq. (18)). Government projects have the potential to alter
aggregate consumption and therefore cannot be treated as if they are “marginal” in the
traditional sense, a point …rst noted by Dasgupta, Sen, and Marglin (1972) and Little and
Mirrlees (1974) and recently emphasized by Martin and Pindyck (2015).11 Put di¤erently,
the existence of government programs itselfs alters the demand for government programs.
For instance, if government policies reduce (increase) the volatility of aggregate consumption
and, hence, the volatility of marginal utility, risk premia will be smaller (larger) than they
would in the corresponding economy where q = 0.
The third term in (19) captures marginal distortionary tax costs generated by the program
and re‡ects the government’s “…scal risk management” motive. When h0 ( t ) > 0, tax
distortions lead the government to act as if it is more risk-averse than the taxpayers it
represents. Speci…cally, this term makes programs less desirable if they tend to raise taxes
on average (i.e., E[X10 (q) + D0 @R=@q] is large) or tend to raise taxes in states of the world
where tax rates are already elevated (i.e., Cov [h0 ( 1 ) ; X10 (q)] is large). By contrast, if
h0 ( ) = 0, the model collapses to the Ricardian case in which the government is a veil for
taxpayers.
A critical tension that emerges from our framework is the con‡ict between the social
risk management motive captured by the second term in (19) and the …scal risk management motive captured by the third term. Programs like deposit insurance and automatic
stabilizers that have signi…cant social risk management bene…ts tend to involve government
expenditures and, hence, higher tax distortions in bad times, creating greater …scal risk.
The …nal term in (19), Cov[M1 ; h0 ( 1 ) (X10 (q)+D0 @R=@q)], is the risk premium stemming
from the cyclicality of taxes and re‡ects the interaction between the “social risk management”
and “…scal risk management”motives. Speci…cally, if a program leads to increased taxes in
bad economic times, the distortions reduce private consumption precisely when it is most
valuable, leading the government to do less of the program than it otherwise might.
2.2.3

Relation to public …nance

Our model is related to several strands of the public …nance literature.
11
There is also a burgeoning literature on how government projects a¤ect the prices of private assets.
Pastor and Veronesi (2012, 2013) and Kelly, Pastor, and Veronesi (2016) note that the e¤ect of government
projects on aggregate consumption itself generates risk and study the e¤ect of this risk on corporate equities
and debt. Bond and Goldstein (2015) argue that if the government relies on market prices for information,
it alters private incentives for information production, which can ultimately make prices less informative.

14

The Samuelson criterion

One strand of the public …nance literature has focused on

project selection in non-stochastic enviornments. To highlight the relationship between our
model and this literature, we rewrite Eq. (17) using the de…nition of household’s stochastic
discount factor in Eq. (18) to obtain
W00 (q) + E [M1 W10 (q)] = X00 (q) + E [M1 X10 (q)]
+ h0 ( 0 ) X00 (q) + E M1 h0 ( 1 ) X10 (q) + D0

@R
@q

.

Here Wt0 (q) is the marginal rate of substitution between direct private consumption and
the bene…ts of the government program. And Xt0 (q) is the marginal rate of transformation
of private output into public output. Speci…cally, Samuelson (1954) argued that optimal
program scale should equate the marginal rate of substitution (Wt0 (q)) with the marginal
rate of transformation (Xt0 (q)). Inspired by Pigou (1947), later work, including Diamond and
Mirrless (1971), Stiglitz and Dasgupta (1971), and Atkinson and Stern (1974), argues that
Samuelson’s criterion no longer holds when the government must …nance its expenditures
using distortionary taxes. Marginal tax distortions (h0 ( t )) must be taken into account.
Our framework shows how these intuitions translate into a dynamic, stochastic setting.
The previous equation shows that optimal scale equates the stochastically discounted marginal rate of substitution (the left-hand-side) with the stochastically discounted marginal
rate of transformation (the right-hand-side), plus an additional term (in curly braces) that
accounts for the incremental tax distortions generated by the government program. The
presence of this additional term means that marginal program costs should be discounted
at a lower rate than marginal program bene…ts. And, because h0 ( 1 ) is unknown as of time
0, this additional term means that …scal risk considerations now impact optimal program
scale.
The Arrow-Lind result

A second strand of the public …nance literature stud-

ies project selection with stochastic payo¤s that are only subject to idiosyncratic risk.
Speci…cally, Arrow and Lind (1970) argued that if the marginal net bene…ts of a program
(W10 (q)

X10 (q)) are only subject to idiosyncratic risk, then those net bene…ts should be

discounted at the riskless rate.

15

Using the fact that E[M1 ] = R 1 , we can rewrite Eq. (17) as
0 = (W00 (q)

X00 (q)

h0 ( 0 ) X00 (q))

+R 1 E W10 (q)

X10 (q)

+Cov M1 ; W10 (q)

h0 ( 1 ) X10 (q)

X10 (q)

@R
@q
@R
h0 ( 1 ) D0
.
@q

h0 ( 1 ) D0

h0 ( 1 ) X10 (q)

This equation shows that a modi…ed version of the Arrow-Lind (1970) theorem holds in our
model when a program’s marginal net bene…ts and marginal tax distortions are only subject
to idiosyncratic risk— i.e., when Cov [M1 ; W10 (q)

X10 (q)

h0 ( 1 ) X10 (q)

h0 ( 1 ) D0 @R=@q] =

0. In this case, the marginal net bene…t generated by the program, including the relevant
marginal tax distortions, should be discounted at the riskless rate. By contrast, if a program’s marginal net bene…ts or tax distortions are subject to systematic risk, then it is not
appropriate to use a riskless discount rate.
Optimal debt management

Finally, our model is related to the literature on optimal

debt management. The …rst order condition for taxes, Eq. (15), captures the idea that the
government should smooth taxes over time when there are convex distortionary costs of
taxation (Barro [1979], Aiyagari, Marcet, Sargent, and Seppala [2002]). We can rewrite the
equation as:
h0 ( 0 ) =

@R
R + D0 @D
E [M1 h0 ( 1 )]
0
.
R
E [M1 ]

When households are risk neutral, this equation reduces to h0 ( 0 ) = E [h0 ( 1 )]: the government fully smooths marginal tax distortions between times 0 and 1. When households
are risk-averse, the government smoothes risk-adjusted marginal tax distortions, recognizing
that its borrowing a¤ects the riskfree rate.
In addition, our model embeds the core intuitions present in the state-contingent debt
management problem studied in Bohn (1990), Aiyagari, Marcet, Sargent, and Seppala (2002),
and Bhandari, Evans, Golosov, and Sargent (2016). In this problem, the government chooses
riskless debt and its issuance q of a risky security with time 0 price P =

X0 and state-

contingent time 1 payo¤s X1 to minimize the cost of distortionary taxes.
This problem can be studied in our framework by setting Wt = Xt , so that the net bene…ts of the project are zero. In this case, the choice of q only impacts household consumption
insofar as it impacts tax revenues. As shown in the Internet Appendix, the optimality condition for q then provides intuitions similar to those in the state-contingent debt management
16

literature. Speci…cally, it says that the government wants to hedge background …scal risk by
issuing risky securities that have low returns (i.e., low X1 =P ) in states where other government spending (G1 ) is unexpectedly high, so that the tax rate

2.3

is unexpectedly high.

Approximate solutions

To clarify the key economic intuitions present in the model, we compute approximate solutions to the above problem by replacing h0 ( t ) and u0 (Ct ) in the two optimality conditions
with …rst-order Taylor series approximations. We also assume that the government program
has constant returns to scale so Wt (q) = qWt and Xt (q) = qXt . These approximations yield
a system of quadratic equations that we can solve in closed form. The details are given in
the Appendix. First, we can approximate the marginal deadweight cost of taxation as
h0 ( t )
where h0 =

tax revenue is T and income is Y . Thus, when

This is a system of two quadratic equations in D0 and q. When

(X1 + D0 q )
> 0 and

> 0, this

system can be reduced to a single quartic equation in q that can be solved in closed form.
And, with either (i) risk-neutral households ( = 0) and tax distortions ( > 0) or (ii) riskaverse households ( > 0) and no tax distortions ( = 0), we obtain a system of two linear
equations in D0 and q.
2.3.1

Approximate solution with risk-neutral households ( = 0 and

> 0)

To build intuition, we …rst consider the special case where households are risk-neutral ( = 0),
but government taxation is distortionary ( > 0). This case, where the government seeks to
generate large net bene…ts for households while limiting …scal risk, allows us to identify the
key determinants of …scal risk in the model.

which says that government borrowing is chosen to smooth expected tax rates over time. As

(X0 + E [X1 ])

.

The …rst term in Eq. (23) is proportional to expected marginal program net bene…ts, i.e.,
(W0

X0 ) + E [W1

X1 ]. The denominator of this term is the direct deadweight costs

from increasing program expenditures at the margin times the e¤ective degree of “…scal risk
aversion.”The e¤ective degree of …scal risk aversion is =Y , which is increasing in the labor
supply elasticity with respect to the tax rate ( ) and decreasing in the tax base (Y ).
The second term in (23) re‡ects the marginal expected deadweight tax costs of the program
that arise in the presence of other government expenditures. Speci…cally, the second term
is equal to expected discounted marginal outlays (i.e., X0 + E [X1 ]) times the expected
marginal deadweight cost of taxation when q = 0. The third term re‡ects …scal risk and
captures the additional deadweight costs that arise if time 1 spending on the program covaries
positively with time 1 tax rates. Naturally, the covariance of program spending with tax
rates is higher when Cov [G1 ; X1 ] is larger or when Cov [Y1 ; X1 ] is smaller.
The next proposition provides a set of intuitive comparative statics, showing how the
optimal scale of the project q depends on the exogenous parameters.
Proposition 2 Consider the case with risk-neutral households ( = 0) and distortionary
taxation ( > 0). Assume that G0 + E [G1 ] > 0, X0 + E [X1 ] > 0, and q > 0. Then we
have the following comparative statics for optimal program scale:
@q =@W0 > 0 and @q =@E [W1 ] > 0;
@q =@X0 < 0 and @q =@E [X1 ] < 0;
@q =@G0 /

(X0 + E [X1 ]) < 0 and @q =@E [G1 ] /

@q =@D /

(X0 + E [X1 ]) < 0;

@q =@ /

((W0

X0 ) + E [W1

X1 ]);

@q =@Corr [X1 ; G1 ] < 0;
19

(X0 + E [X1 ]) < 0;

@q =@Corr [X1 ; Y1 ] > 0;
@q =@V ar [X1 ] < 0.
Proof. Di¤erentiation of Eq. (23).
These comparative statics identify the drivers of …scal risk in the mode. For instance,
the optimal scale of a program with positive outlays (X0 + E [X1 ] > 0) declines with other
government spending (G0 or E [G1 ]). Intuitively, increasing other government spending raises
the …scal burden and tax distortions. By decreasing the scale of a positive-outlay program,
the government can reduce the need for distortionary taxation, partially o¤setting the e¤ect
of increased spending.
Similar logic applies to the e¤ect of the severity of marginal tax distortions, . At the
optimum, @q =@ is proportional to

((W0

X1 ]), so an increase in , which

X0 )+ E [W1

controls the deadweight loss from taxation, leads the government to cut back on attractive
projects with large discounted net bene…ts. In addition, all else equal, the government
should choose a smaller scale for programs whose outlays are more variable. Finally, the
government should choose a smaller scale for programs whose outlays covary positively with
other spending (G1 ) or negatively with the tax base (Y1 ).
Rather than considering the optimal program scale q , we can instead …x program scale
and consider the initial fee that that the government should charge for the program. Specifically, we …x the scale of the program at some level q and then allow the initial fee the
government charges, P =

X0 , to adjust so that the optimal scale, q , equals q. For in-

stance, in the case of deposit insurance, the fee P corresponds to the deposit insurance
premia that the government charges …nancial institutions at time 0. In the case of unemployment insurance, P corresponds to the level of payroll taxes at time 0. Using (23), the
optimal program fee satis…es

The following proposition characterizes the behavior of the initial fees the government should
charge for speci…c programs.
Proposition 3 Consider the case with risk-neutral households ( = 0) and distortionary
taxation ( > 0). Assume that G0 + E [G1 ] > 0,

P + E [X1 ] > 0, and q > 0. Then we

have the following comparative statics for optimal program fees, P :
20

@P =@W0 < 0 and @P =@ (E [W1 ]) < 0;
@P =@E [X1 ] > 0;
@P =@G0 / ( P + E [X1 ]) > 0 and @P =@E [G1 ] / ( P + E [X1 ]) > 0;
@P =@D / ( P + E [X1 ]) > 0;
@P =@ / W0 + P + E [W1

X1 ];

@P =@Corr [X1 ; G1 ] > 0;
@P =@Corr [X1 ; Y1 ] < 0;
When Corr [X1 ; G1 ] > 0 and Corr [X1 ; Y1 ] < 0, we have @P0 =@V ar [X1 ] > 0;
@P =@q / ( P + E [X1 ])2 =(1 + ) + V ar [X1 ] > 0.
Naturally, the optimal fee is smaller for programs that generate greater social bene…ts
and is larger for programs with greater expected future outlays. When the program involves
a net outlay in the sense that ( P + E [X1 ]) > 0, the optimal fee is larger when other
government spending (G0 or E [G1 ]) is larger. All else equal, fees should be higher for
programs whose time 1 outlays covary more strongly with tax rates and, under plausible
conditions, whose time 1 outlays are more volatilte. Finally, all else equal, the optimal fee
is increasing in the size of the program.
2.3.2

Approximate solution with no tax distortions ( = 0 and

> 0)

We next consider the special case where households are risk-averse ( > 0) and there are no
tax distortions ( = 0). This case, where the government seeks to generate large net bene…ts
for households and to manage social risk, allows us to identify the key drivers of social risk
in the model.
Because

= 0, Ricardian equivalence holds: the level of debt is irrelevant and is not

pinned down at the optimum. In this case, the Appendix shows that the approximate …rst
order condition for q in (21) can be solved to obtain:

21

The numerator of the …rst term in Eq. (25) is proportional to time 1 expected marginal
utility when q = 0 (i.e., 1

E [Y1

risk-neutral households (i.e., (W0

G1 ]

C ) times expected program net bene…ts for
X1 ]). The denominator captures the

X0 ) + E [W1

“wealth e¤ect” that arises because the chosen level of q a¤ects the marginal utility of riskaverse households. Projects that generate large expected bene…ts lower marginal utility,
making further projects with positive expected ben…ts less appealing to households. The
second term in (25) arises only when Y0

G0 6= E [Y1

G1 ] and re‡ects any bene…ts of

smoothing consumption between time 0 and time 1.

The …nal term in Eq. (25) captures the pure social risk management motive of smoothing consumption across states at time 1. This risk management term is proportional to
Cov [Y1

G1 ; W1

X1 ]. In other words, the government likes programs that are a hedge

against exogenous shocks, both those emanating from the private economy (Y1 ) and those
emanating from other government expenditures (G1 ).
In this Ricardian case, comparative statics with respect to the W s and Xs are generally ambiguous due to competing substitution and wealth e¤ects. These wealth e¤ects arise
because the government program impacts aggregate consumption and hence aggregate marginal utility. For instance, the impact of program net bene…ts at time 0 on optimal scale
is
@q =@ (W0

X0 ) / (1

C0 )

q (W0

X0 ) ;

which is ambiguous. Holding marginal utility …xed, an increase in (W0

X0 ) leads to a

substitution e¤ect that makes the government want to do more of the program. But there
is a competing wealth e¤ect: the increase in (W0

X0 ) reduces marginal utility and lowers

the government’s willingness to pay, pushing it to do less of the program.
In contrast, comparative statics with respect to the Y s and Gs will be unambiguous
because they only involve wealth e¤ects, which alter the government’s willingness to pay for
a particular program. For instance, we have @q =@Y0 /
22

(W0

X0 ) < 0.

Finally, we have @q =@ /

((W0

X1 ]), so an increase in risk aversion

X0 ) + E [W1

leads the government to do less of programs that have positive expected net bene…ts when
discounted at the risk-free rate.
2.3.3

Solution with both risk aversion and tax distortions

Finding the approximate solution in the general case where

> 0 and

> 0 requires solving

a system of two quadratic equations in q and D0 , namely Eqs. (21) and (20). These two
equations can be combined to yield a quartic equation in q alone that can be solved in closed
form. We do not pursue this approach here because the general formula is unwieldly and
adds little additional insight.
Instead, we explore the general case where

> 0 and

> 0 using numerical examples.

As these examples highlight, a key takeaway is that the government’s social risk management and …scal risk management motives often pull in opposite directions. Which motive
dominates depends on the parameters of the economy and the project.
Table 1 lists the baseline parameters underlying our numerical example. At time 0,
exogenous private income is Y0 = 1 and exogenous government spending is G0 = 0. At
time 1, a high state occurs with probability p = 50%. In the high state, private income is
Y1H = 1:2, and government spending is G1H =

0:1. With probability 1

p = 50%, a low

state occurs. We interpret the low state as a severe recession that leads to a large rise in
government spending on automatic stabilizer programs. In the low state, exogenous income
is Y1L = 0:8, and government spending is G1L = 0:1. Thus, the expected growth rates of
private income and other government spending are both zero.
Three parameters control household preferences:

,

, and C. We set

risk-free rate would be zero in the absence of risk aversion. We set

= 1, so the

= 0:25 and C = 1,

so that marginal utility equals one when Ct = 1 and declines to 0 when Ct = 5. Turning
to the …scal parameters, we set D = 0:6— a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60%— to capture the case
where a government faces a high accumulated …scal burden. We set

= 0:05. Thus, in the

benchmark case where T0 = T1 = 0:3, the marginal cost of social funds is roughly 1:015
because marginal tax distortions are 1:5% = 5%

30%.

The program we consider is meant to represent a …nancial stability intervention such as
deposit insurance. The program requires government outlays of X0 = 0:024 at time 0, and
creates no additional private income at time 0, so W0 = 0. The project requires no outlays
and generates no additional income in the high state at time 1, so X1H = W1H = 0. In the
low state at time 1, the project requires large outlays of X1L = 0:05, but generates signi…ant
23

additional private income of W1L = 0:1. Overall, the net bene…ts for risk-neutral households
are quite small: (W0

X0 ) + E [W1

X1 ] = 0:0014.

Table 2 reports the exact optimal government policies (D0 ; q; R) in this example obtained
from solving (1), (3), (12), (15), and (17), assuming a quadratic utility function of the form
u (Ct ) = Ct

( =2) Ct

2

C . Table 3 reports the approximate optimal government policies

(D0 ; q) in this example obtained from solving our system of quadratics given in (20) and
(21). The approximate solutions given in Table 3 are close to the exact solutions in Table 2.
Thus, our discussion focuses on Table 2:
Panel A of Table 2 reports the optimal scale of the …nancial stability program q, Panel B
reports optimal time 0 debt, and Panel C reports the risk-free rate R

1. The ten rows in

each panel show how optimal policy varies with parameters of the economy and the program
under consideration. The …ve columns show how optimal policy varies with household risk
aversion ( ) and …scal costs ( ). Speci…cally, column (1) reports our baseline results with
= 0:25 and

= 0:05— i.e., with both risk aversion and tax distortions. Column (2) shows

the risk-neutral solution with only tax distortions:
the Ricardian solution with

= 0:25 and

= 0 and

= 0:05. Column (3) shows

= 0. Because Ricardian equivalence holds in this

case, debt is indeterminate in Panel B. Column (4) shows the e¤ect of increasing risk-aversion
relative to the baseline, setting

= 0:35 and

= 0:05. Finally, collumn (5) shows the e¤ect

of increasing tax distortions relative to the baseline, setting

= 0:25 and

= 0:075.

We start with the results in row (1) and column (1). The optimal scale of the project
in Panel A is q = 3:73. Although the net bene…ts for risk-neutral households are small, the
…nancial stability program is an attractive “social hedge”that delivers additional consumption in the low state when marginal utility is high. To smooth taxes over time, Panel B
shows that the government borrows D0 = 0:25 at time 0. Panel C shows that the risk-free
rate is 4:6%, re‡ecting the fact that marginal utility is expected to decline slightly between
time 0 and time 1.
Moving across the …rst row, column (2) shows that optimal program scale declines when
households are risk-neutral: risk-neutral households naturally have a lower willingness to pay
for this social hedge. Similarly, optimal program scale rises when there are no tax distortions
in column (3). Finally, q rises in column (4) when risk aversion rises to
column (5) when tax distortions increase to

= 0:50 and q falls in

= 0:075. Taken together, the results in row (1)

illustrate a key lesson from our model: the need to manage …scal risk can signi…cantly reduce
the government’s ability to manage social risk. Speci…cally, when taxes are distortionary
( > 0), the government should only choose a large amount of a program if it has large net

24

bene…ts in expectation ((W0
(Cov [Y1

G1 ; W1

X0 ) + E [W1

X1 ] is large) or if it is a strong social hedge

X1 ] is large). Put di¤erently, the distortionary costs of taxation argue

in favor of …scal conservatism, raising the hurdle that needs to be cleared before government
initiates a candidate program designed to correct a market failure or to manage social risk.
The remaining rows in Table 2 show how optimal policy varies with parameters of the
background economy and the program. In row (2), we increase the goverment’s accumulated
de…cit by 20% from D = 0:6 to D = 0:72. When taxation is distortionary— i.e., in all
columns other than (3), this leads to a decline in optimal program scale. Intuitively, raising
the government’s accumulated de…cit increases tax distortions. By decreasing the scale of a
program with positive outlays, the government can reduce the need for distortionary taxation,
partially o¤setting the e¤ect of the rise in D. Put di¤erently, our model is consistent with a
“…scal austerity”logic under which a high accumulated de…cit reduces the attractiveness of
most government programs at the margin.
In row (3), we raise expected private income at time 1 by 0:05 relative to the baseline
in row (1)— i.e., we set Y1H = 1:25 and Y1L = 0:85. The rise in E [Y1 ] has two competing
e¤ects. When households are risk averse, the increase in E [Y1 ] lowers marginal utility at time
1, reducing the willingness to pay for the …nancial stability program. However, the increase
in E [Y1 ] also lowers expected tax rates, leading to a decline in the marginal deadweight costs
from taxation. This force pushes the government to do more of the project. This can be see
in column (2), which shows that tax distortions have an o¤setting e¤ect, so q actually rises
when households are risk neutral ( = 0) and taxes are distortionary ( > 0).
In row (4), we make the economy riskier by raising the volatility of time 1 income by 0:05
relative to the baseline, setting Y1H = 1:25 and Y1L = 0:75. Again, the rise in V ar [Y1 ] has
two competing e¤ects. Higher volatility makes the …nancial stability program more valuable
as a social hedge, increasing the optimal program scale. However, the increase in V ar [Y1 ]
raises the volatility of tax rates at time 1. Since Cov [X1 ; Y1 ] < 0, the resulting increase in
…scal risk pushes the government to do less of the program. This can be seen in column (2),
which shows that tax distortions have an o¤setting e¤ect, so q falls when households are
risk neutral ( = 0) and taxes are distortionary ( > 0).
In row (5), we increase expected time 1 government spending by 0:05, setting G1H =
0:05 and G1L = 0:15. The rise in E [G1 ] has two competing e¤ects. When households are
risk averse, this change increases expected marginal utility at time 1, pushing the government
to do more of the program. Put di¤erently, increased government spending can create
additional demand for other government projects. However, when taxes are distortionary,

25

raising E [G1 ] also increases expected taxes, pushing the government to reduce the scale of
the program. Therefore, the e¤ect on an increase in E [G1 ] is generally ambiguous. However,
in our example, the former force outweighs the latter.
In row (6), we increase the volatility of time 1 government spending holding …xed the
mean, setting G1H =

0:15 and G1L = 0:15. As above, the rise in V ar [G1 ] works through

two competing channels. When households are risk averse, more volatile government spending makes marginal utility more volatile, pushing the government to do more of the program
on social risk management grounds. When taxation is distortionary, more volatile government spending increases …scal risk, pushing the government to reduce the scale of the
program. Again, in our example, the …rst channel outweighs the second.
In row (7), we increase the expected bene…ts of the program, settuing W1L = 0:0025
and W1H = 0:1025. Although changes in E [W1 ] have competing substitution and wealth
e¤ects, the substitution e¤ect dominates in our example, so optimal program scale rises
with E [W1 ]. In row (8), we increase the variance of the project payo¤s, holding …xed the
mean, setting W1L =

0:005 and W1H = 0:105. Holding …xed marginal utility, the resulting

substitution e¤ect makes the project more desirable as a social hedge when households are
risk averse. Again, there is a competing wealth e¤ect because this change lowers expected
marginal utility for a given level of q. As shown in Table 2, the overall impact on program
scale is ambiguous.
In row (9), we increase the expected time 1 program outlays to X1L = 0:001 and X1H =
0:051. In our example, the resulting substitution e¤ect dominates, so this change always
reduces the optimal program scale. Finally, in row (10), we increase the variance of program
outlays, holding …xed the mean, at time 1, so that X1L = 0:0025 and X1H = 0:0525. The
optimal scale of the project falls. Distortionary costs are convex of function of tax revenue,
so increasing the variance of taxes raises expected tax distortions, leading the government
to reduce the scale of the program. By contrast, as column (3) shows, when there are no tax
distortions increasing the variance of program outlays has only a neglible e¤ect on program
scale.
Overall, Table 2 illustrates how the government’s need to manage …scal risk limits its
capacity to manage social risk. The table also highlights the fact that the government’s social
risk and …scal risk management motives often pull in opposite directions as the characteristics
of the economy or the government program change.

Portfolios of government programs

We now extend our framework to characterize the optimal portfolio of government programs.
The same basic tradeo¤s between social and …scal risk management that we emphasized
above continue to apply. However, these tradeo¤s now acquire a portfolio management
‡avor. Speci…cally, distortionary taxation and household risk aversion create interdependencies amongst otherwise unrelated government programs. For instance, when taxes are
distortionary, the …scal risk of a program depends on how its required outlays covary with
those of the government’s overall portfolio of programs. Similarly, when households are risk
averse, the social risk of a program depends (in part) on how its net bene…ts covary with the
net bene…ts of the government’s portfolio of programs. As a result, government programs
cannot be evaluated in isolation. Instead, proper cost-bene…t analysis needs to explicitly
take these …scal risk and social risk interdependencies into account.

3.1

Optimal portfolios

Di¤erent government programs are indexed by j = 1; :::; J; and we let qj denote the chosen
scale of program j. For simplicity, we focus on the case where each program has constant
returns to scale. Thus, for t = 0 and 1, the government outlays for program j are qj Xtj
and the additional private income generated by program j is qj Wtj . Adopting the vector
notation that [q]j =qj , [xt ]j =Xtj , and [wt ]j =Wtj , this means that the …rst order condition
for q is now
0 = u0 (C0 ) (w0

h0 ( 0 ) x0 )

Eqs. (15) and (26), and where

0;

1,

and R are implicitly de…ned by the vector analogs of

12

Eqs. (11) and (12).

As in the single program case, one can also include a set of non-negativity constraints to study the
extension margin of government program choice.

3.3

Ex-ante regulation versus ex-post bailouts

We now use the multi-program extension to explore the optimal mix of programs the government should use to promote …nancial stability. Speci…cally, we consider the choice between
ex-ante regulations and ex-post bailout programs, sometimes referred to as the “lean versus
clean”tradeo¤.13 Both …nancial regulations and bailouts may be bene…cial from a …nancial
stability standpoint, helping to reduce the likelihood or severity of …nancial crises. Ex-ante
regulation can rein in risk-taking by …nancial intermediaries, reducing the probability of
…nancial crises. However, regulation may ine¢ ciently reduce ex ante economic growth to
the extent that it chokes o¤ useful …nancial innovations or leads intermediaries to unduly
restrict the supply of credit. Alternatively, the government can use bailouts in the form of
debt guarantees or capital injections to clean up …nancial crises ex-post. Ex-post bailouts
leave ex-ante growth unfettered, but require a larger use of government …scal capacity in the
event of a crisis.
Our framework suggests that the optimal mix between these two interventions varies with
the extent of tax distortions and the government’s preexisting …scal commitments.14 We
illustrate these ideas formally in the risk-neutral case where

= 0 and

> 0. Let program

j = 1 denote ex-ante regulations and program j = 2 denote ex-post bailouts. Without loss
of generality, we focus on bene…ts and outlays at time 1; assuming that W0j = 0 and X0j = 0
for j = 1; 2, G0 = E [G1 ] = 0, and Y0 = E [Y1 ] = Y . To ease notation, we drop the time
subscripts so that, for example, X1 denotes outlays associated with regulatory program 1
and X2 denotes outlays associated with bailout program 2.
We assume that regulation is a …scally riskless program in the sense that outlays are
constant across states: V ar [X1 ] = 0. Regulatory outlays can be thought of as the costs of
paying regulators and conducting bank examinations. Obviously, bailouts are a …scally risky
program so V ar [X2 ] > 0. For example, bailout outlays can be thought of as the realized
…scal costs of a program that guarantees short-term debt issued by …nancial intermediaries,
net of any insurance premia paid by intermediaries. Furthermore, we assume
that spending
h
i
on bailouts tends to be high in states where tax rates are high, so Cov G YT Y; X2 > 0.
13

http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/stein20131018a.htm
de Faria e Castro, Martinez, and Philippon (2014) also study the relationship between …scal capacity
and …nancial stability interventions. However, their focus is on government policies that disclose information
about asset quality in the …nancial sector.

This formula illustrates the forces that determine q1 and q2 .15 The …rst term in Eq. (28)
says that an increase in the expected returns to ex-ante regulation, E [W1

X1 ] =E [X1 ],

raises q1 . The second term in Eq. (28) says that an increase in the di¤erential expected returns to ex-post bailouts versus ex-ante regulation, E [W2

X2 ] =E [X2 ] E [W1

X1 ] =E [X1 ],

leads the government to substitute from ex-ante regulation towards ex-post bailouts. (Indeed,
since bailouts are …scally risky, the government should only choose q2 > 0 if the expected
returns to ex-post bailouts are su¢ ciently greater than the returns to ex-ante regulation.)
Given the desire to smooth tax rates, any substitution from regulation to bailouts is stronger
when V ar [X2 ] is small. The last two terms in Eq. (28) capture the way that background
…scal risk impacts the choices of q1 and q2 . Speci…cally, an increase in accumulated de…cits
D reduces the desirability of regulation. Finally, when bailout spending covaries with other
T
Y

…scal risks— i.e., when Cov[G

Y; X2 ] is large, the desire to manage …scal risk argues

against bailouts and in favor of regulation. The following proposition describes the behavior
of the optimal mix at an interior optimum.
Proposition 4 Suppose that

= 0 and

> 0 and that regulation (program 1) and bailouts

(program 2) have the characteristics assumed above. At an interior optimum where both
q1 > 0 and q2 > 0, we have the following comparative statics:

The comparative statics have strong analogies to portfolio choice logic. As the level
of accumulated de…cits D rises, all adjustment takes place by reducing the amount of the
…scallly riskless program— i.e., ex-ante regulation. This is analogous to the portfolio choice
logic that dictates that with constant absolute risk aversion, the total dollar amount invested
in risky assets does not vary with total wealth. Only the amount invested in riskless assets
varies.
Since taxation is distortionary, raising the correlation between bailout spending and tax
rates, Corr[G

T
Y

Y; X2 ], or the variance of tax rates, V ar[G

T
Y

Y ], makes bailouts less

attractive and regulation more attractive. These results can also be interpreted as motivating
“…nancial repression” at high levels of government debt. Reinhart and Sbrancia (2011)
argue that at high levels of government debt, …nancial regulation is used to force …nancial
intermediaries to hold government debt, providing a captive buyer. Our model makes the
point that …nancial repression may be optimal in high debt situations, not just because the
government needs a buyer of debt but because the government cannot a¤ord the costs of the
alternative …nancial stability policy— namely, ex post bailouts.
Finally, we consider the e¤ect on changing the extent of tax distortions re‡ected in . An
increase in tax distortions always leads to a reduction in the amount of …scally risky bailout
programs, @q2 =@ < 0. To the extent that ex-post bailouts are highly attractive relative to
ex-ante regulation (i.e., E [W2

X2 ] =E [X2 ]

E [W1

X1 ] =E [X1 ] is large), the increase in

distortions also leads the government to substitute to …scally riskless regulation. However,
to the extent that ex-ante regulation is highly attractive (i.e., E [W1

X1 ] =E [X1 ] is large),

there is an o¤setting e¤ect: in this case regulatory expenditures are already quite large, so
the increase in distortions leads the government to cut back on regulation as well.
We have discussed comparative statics in terms of quantities here. As pointed out above,
if we …x the quantities of regulation and bailouts, comparative statics in terms of their prices
will simply have the opposite signs. Thus, the price the government charges intermediaries
for …nancial guarantees should rise with the scale of existing …scal commitments and tax
distortions.
31

Conclusion

We present a model in which the distortionary taxation makes …nancing costly for the government. We explore the consequences of this assumption for the set of programs that the
government should choose to undertake. As in the corporate …nance literature on costly
external …nance, we show that distortionary taxation impacts the optimal scale and pricing of government programs. In particular, the government has both social and …scal risk
management motives. The social risk management motive arises from the fact that some
government programs deliver large bene…ts in bad states when household marginal utility
is high. The …scal risk management motive arises from the government’s desire to avoid
raising distortionary taxes further in states where taxes are already high. Neither …scal risk
nor social risk can be judged in isolation. For example, a program’s …scal risk depends on
how its outlays comove with those of other programs.
We highlight the interaction between the social and …scal risk management motives.
These motives frequently come into con‡ict because programs with signi…cant social risk
management bene…ts often entail large government expenditures and, hence, higher tax
distortions in bad times, adding to total …scal risk.
