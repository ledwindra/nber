Eliminating the Pass-Through: Towards FDI Statistics that Better Capture the Financial and
Economic Linkages between Countries
Maria Borga and Cecilia Caliandro
NBER Working Paper No. 25029
September 2018
JEL No. E01,F21,F6
ABSTRACT
FDI plays a central role in managing global production networks, but FDI statistics also reflect
other factors, including tax avoidance, that make it difficult to differentiate between FDI for
“long-term” investments that serves as a source of growth and FDI that is purely financial and has
little real economic impact as it merely passes through an economy. This latter FDI also obscures
the ultimate sources and destinations of FDI. This paper addresses these challenges by developing
a framework for consolidated FDI statistics based on the nationality of the MNE group that
complements residency-based FDI statistics. While residency-based statistics are useful to
identify where financial claims and liabilities are held, nationality-based statistics provide
information on who makes the decisions, reaps the benefits, and bears the risk. Consolidated FDI
statistics remove pass-through capital and are better for understanding ‘real’ financial integration
between economies and for analysing the relationship between the financing of MNEs and their
operations. While some countries produce separate FDI statistics for resident Special Purpose
Entities (SPEs) to identify pass-through capital, we demonstrate that this only provides a partial
view and that about one-quarter of the inward FDI positions in a selection of European countries
reflects pass-through capital through non-SPEs.

Introduction
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been and remains a key aspect and driver of globalisation.
Multinational enterprises (MNEs) access markets and key inputs, such as natural resources and human
capital, and locate stages of production in countries to take advantage of factor cost differences through
their foreign investments. These foreign investments have facilitated the creation of complex global
production chains managed by (MNEs) that support employment and generate income in the host
economies. FDI statistics seek to measure these long term investments. However, other factors, in
particular fiscal optimisation, have also played a role in the shape and depth of these chains. When the
FDI flows are related to purely financial flows engineered to minimise tax payments or overcome
regulatory barriers, there is little direct impact on the host economy, at least in a traditional production
sense. This latter form of FDI often involves MNEs channelling investments through several countries,
‘inflating’ FDI flows and positions as each flow into and out of each country is counted even if the
capital, or income, is just passing through. This can make it difficult to interpret FDI statistics in the
sense that they are not ‘real’ and provide little in the way of “long-term” investments in the host
economy. In essence, the financial structure of the MNE as captured in FDI statistics does not match
the operational structure of the MNE, which reflects the organisation of its operations across countries.
Indeed, in some countries such as Hungary, so significant is the perceived scale of ‘pass-through’ capital
that the policy focus now looks in large part at net rather than gross flows of FDI to determine the
amount of inward FDI that remains in the host economy; however, while this approach provides a better
metric for Hungary than traditional FDI statistics, it is far from ideal for countries with significant
amounts of outward investment that originate from their economies. Moreover, this approach cannot
provide information on the ultimate sources and destinations of FDI when the statistics are compiled by
immediate partner country.
The main goal of this paper is to propose a definition of pass-through capital, together with experimental
estimates, based on the ultimate ownership and location of the assets that can be used as the basis for
techniques to consolidate FDI statistics to remove these ‘distortionary’ flows, and in turn reallocate FDI
positions and income flows from immediate to ultimate partner economies. The statistics, therefore,
take a nationality approach to classification by reflecting the entity that ultimately influences or controls
the FDI units and, thus, could contribute to further developing nationality-based statistics to better
analyse globalisation.
However, this is not the only area where FDI data, on its own, may fail to create a complete picture of
the overall scale of the impact of investment within an economy. Because MNEs can leverage their
direct investments, parent enterprises can control assets in the host country that are many multiples of
their initial investment. As discussed further below, the framework proposed in the paper to consolidate
FDI statistics can be extended to capture the full financing of the MNE, providing a more complete
picture of the economic involvement of the MNE in the host and home economies.

1

The methodology proposed in this paper would produce statistics that are designed to address some
important policy issues surrounding FDI. For example, they would provide better measures of financial
integration between economies by stripping out the financial intermediation activities within MNEs.
The statistics could be linked to other statistics capturing the operations of MNEs to analyse the links
between FDI and trade as well as provide information on the alignment between where economic
activity occurs and where the MNE attributes its income. Finally, they could provide a more complete
picture of the involvement of the MNE in the economy as well as its cross-border and local exposures.
The first section of this paper gives some examples of the ways MNEs pass capital along their ownership
structures and establishes the connection between pass-through capital and ultimate partner country.
The second section defines what we mean by pass-through capital in terms of direct investment
positions. From this, the related definition of pass-through income is derived. Then, the paper defines
the concepts of ultimate investing country, based on the nationality of the ultimate investor, and of
ultimate host country based, on the objective of producing symmetric statistics. The third section
provides experimental estimates for some European members of the OECD to provide order of
magnitude estimates of their importance and potential ‘distortionary’ impact on current FDI statistics.
The fourth section considers the relationship of the proposed consolidated FDI statistics to other sets of
economic statistics as well as some unresolved issues. The fifth section discusses potential policy uses
for the proposed statistics. The final section concludes and provides some recommendations for ways
forward.

I. Pass-through capital: issues and examples
Interpretability challenges presented by measurement issues with FDI statistics are not new (see Box
1), but the spotlight has intensified in recent years, particularly with regard to pass-through capital. Put
simply, pass-through capital is capital that flows into one economy and that is subsequently invested in
another economy. In a 2016 report, Blanchard and Acalin concluded that a large proportion of measured
FDI flows consisted of flows going into and out of countries on their way to their final destinations
(passing through) and moreover that these flows were, in effect, driven by changes in tax regimes and
short-run movements in U.S. monetary policy to a much greater extent than would have been expected
if the flows were actually in relation to the long run, 'bricks and mortar' type of investment that analysts
typically infer from FDI statistics. Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2017) drew similar conclusions, finding
that measured FDI flows inhibited the post-crisis analysis of international financial integration as they
show that much of the expansion in FDI flows was with financial centres, suggesting that it was driven
by the increasing complexity of corporate structures rather than by 'genuine' FDI flows.
MNEs can access financial systems in many different countries to optimise their capital structures, so
there are several different forms that pass-through capital can take. This is, of course, not a new
phenomenon, although it is growing, and the latest international standards (BD4) 1 began to address this
issue through the recommendation that entities that have pass-through capital activities as their only, or
main, activity and that have little or no physical presence in an economy are separately identified.
Excluding FDI associated with these entities, called Special Purpose Entities (SPEs), yields better

The OECD’s Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment, 4th edition (BD4) was published in 2008. It
provides the most complete and detailed guidance on the coverage, collection, compilation, and dissemination of
FDI statistics. In addition to providing guidance on the collection of aggregate FDI statistics that is aligned with
the IMF’s Balance of Payments and international Investment Positions Manual, 6th edition (BPM6) but also
offers guidance on compilation of supplemental FDI series that enhance the usefulness and relevance of FDI
statistics.

measures of the inward FDI that is having a real impact on their economy and of the outward FDI that
originates in their economy. However, BD4 acknowledged that while SPEs are an important channel
for pass-through capital, they are not the only one. As such, it included developing guidance on the
identification of capital passing through operating affiliates on its research agenda.
OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment, 4th edition: Recommendations
Related to Pass-through Capital
The 4th edition of the OECD's Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment (BD4) took an
important step towards improving the measurement of FDI statistics by addressing some of the
challenges raised by pass-through capital. BD4 recommended that FDI associated with resident
Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) be separately compiled so that FDI statistics excluding resident
SPEs could be derived. SPEs are entities whose role is to facilitate the internal financing of the
MNE but that have little or no physical presence in an economy. By excluding such entities from
their FDI statistics, countries have a better measure of the FDI into their country that is having a
‘real’ impact on their economy. In addition, BD4 also recommended use of the extended directional
principle to better capture the direction and degree of influence of the investment and to remove
some double-counting in the FDI statistics when debt passes through affiliated entities, called
fellow enterprises (BD4, page 29-31). Under the extended directional principle, if the fellow
enterprise in the reporting economy makes a loan to a fellow in another country, it is treated as a
reduction in inward investment in the reporting economy if the common direct investor is nonresident because the funds that flowed into the reporting economy from the foreign direct investor
have now flowed to another country, reducing the amount of foreign investment in the reporting
economy. Previously, such loans were usually treated as outward investment by the resident fellow
but should not have been because it is their common direct investor that retains the influence.
Additionally, to look through complex corporate structures to see the ultimate source of investment,
BD4 recommended that countries compile inward investment positions according to the Ultimate
Investing Country (UIC) to identify the country of the investor that actually controls the
investments in their country. Although not directly related to the ‘pass-through’ problem, the ability
to identify FDI flows on a UIC basis can be an important part of a comprehensive solution to the
measurement issues in FDI statistics.
Nevertheless, BD4 recognized that these were only partial solutions. As such, it included a
Research Agenda that included items related to pass-through capital, including through operating
affiliates, and to further develop the presentation by ultimate partner country, especially by ultimate
host country (BD4, page 223 to 225).
Fully capturing pass-through capital necessarily requires a basic framework for identifying passthrough capital in all its forms. Evidence from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis on the balance
sheets of U.S.-owned affiliates shows that pass-through capital is extensive but also that it varies
significantly across different sectors. Figure 1 shows the shares of equity investment in other foreign
affiliates in the total non-current assets of U.S.-owned affiliates abroad by major sector of the U.S.
parent. This variation indicates that pass-through capital could serve several purposes and provide more
benefits to enterprises in some sectors than in others.

The discussion below begins to develop a framework through a taxonomy of the motivations for passthrough capital, the characteristics of the countries that attract that type of pass-through, and the likely
impacts on the host economy. The taxonomy illustrates the particular difficulties in identifying capital
passing though operating affiliates: while the issue of pass-through capital focuses on the distortions
between the financial and operational structures of MNEs caused by the fiscal and financial optimisation
activities within the firm, some forms of pass-through capital in operating affiliates facilitate the
operational structure, making it difficult to distinguish the pass-through capital. At the highest level, the
framework divides pass-through activities into those that occur completely within the firm and so only
involve FDI and those that involve financing from sources other than FDI; this latter type would have
to extend the identification of pass-through capital to other forms of international investment, such as
portfolio and other investment, to fully address them in the International Investment Position (IIP)
statistics. Much of this discussion draws on Lewellen and Robinson (2013).

1.1. Pass-through capital within the firm
Pass-through capital within the firm can take different forms and serve different purposes. Five major
reasons for pass-through capital are discussed below.
1) Tax avoidance. This is probably the most cited motivation for pass-through capital. MNEs can
channel funds through affiliates in different countries to both shift income as well as take advantage of
opportunities to defer taxes on income (see Desai, Foley, and Hines (2003) for a discussion of the use
of indirect ownership to avoid and defer taxes). This activity can be done through both SPEs and
operating affiliates. Somewhat paradoxically, recent initiatives to encourage MNEs to better align
where they report income with where they have economic activities 2 may have exacerbated
measurement challenges by encouraging firms to record pass-through capital in affiliates with a small,
but real, presence in the host economy (IMF, 2017 Task Force on SPEs report). The capital passing
through these 'near SPEs' is not captured in the current statistics of resident SPEs because these entities

do not meet all of the criteria, especially little or no employment or physical presence in the host
economy.
Pass-through capital due to tax avoidance would be associated with countries that offered tax
advantages, including special tax treatments for intellectual property (IP). These countries typically
offer not only low tax rates but also networks of double taxation treaties. Pass-through capital associated
with tax avoidance is likely to result in significant FDI positions for the countries involved but have
less direct impact on the economy (that is, lower levels of employment, value added, and tangible capital
at the foreign-owned entities). This type of pass-through capital would be characterised by high asset
to employment ratios as well as significant royalty and license fee income at the entity involved in the
pass-through. It could also be associated with certain industries, such as holding companies. While it
might not have significant direct impacts, it can have considerable indirect impacts on the host economy
by supporting industries offering services to foreign investors such as financial services and tax
planning industries; these indirect impacts can be particularly important in small economies.
2) Expropriation or other risks to the value of their investment. MNEs that seek to limit their exposure
to “political” risk or wish to benefit from an advantageous investor protection regime could structure
an investment through a country that offers the desired treaty-based protections. For example, if the
investor’s home country does not have a bilateral investment treaty or equivalent arrangement with the
host country, it may choose to hold the investment indirectly through one of its affiliates in a country
that does have such a treaty with the host country of the investment. An examination of disputes records
and law firms’ client advisory services shows that, for example, subsidiaries in the Netherlands are
often recommended and used by investors that are ultimately controlled by non-Dutch parents to bring
claims under Dutch IIAs (Van Os and Knotterus, 2011). 3 Because treaties are often interpreted as to
enable indirect shareholders to obtain compensation for losses, in the event that host government
measures affect the operating company (if there is a treaty in force between their country of nationality
and the host country), complex ownership structures may actually be advantageous because they offer
options for additional shareholder claims (Gaukrodger, 2013). 4 As a result, this type of pass-through
capital would be more likely to occur in host countries with a large network of bilateral investment
treaties or in countries that have treaties with unusual partners. It would also likely have limited direct
impacts on the host economy but possibly could have indirect impacts by supporting an industry
offering services to foreign investors.
3) Reduction in transaction costs. Affiliates in the MNE’s production network that have a significant
amount of interactions may find closer ownership links reduce transaction costs and facilitate these
interactions. For example, an MNE investing in the United States may invest in Mexico and Canada
through their U.S. operation, forming an integrated, regional operation. While the motivation for this
pass-through capital clearly differs from those described above, it remains the case that the U.S.
operation is still facilitating pass-through capital for the ultimate parent.
This type of arrangement would be more likely to happen between affiliates with strong commercial
links or with more complex production processes and products, where the transaction costs would be
expected to be higher. Thus, it is more likely to happen between affiliates in countries that share strong

ultimate controlling parent was not Dutch, and 25 of the claimants had no staff in the Netherlands.

(2018).

commercial ties as evidenced by significant trade flows and that share preferential trade agreements. It
would also be more common in countries that are physically or culturally close.
With this type of pass-through capital, the financial structure overlaps with the reporting and operational
structure within the MNE. As such, there is likely to be more direct impacts in the host economy as
these pass-through entities may have significant employment, value added, R&D, and trade in both
goods and services; they are also likely to have indirect impacts in the host economy in a number of
areas, including by integrating domestic suppliers into the production networks they coordinate.
4) Inherited ownership links. When an MNE acquires an existing MNE, it also acquires the ownership
structure. In these cases, the amount paid by the acquiring MNE covers not just the assets in the
reporting economy where the acquired MNE was headquartered, but also assets in other economies
where the acquired MNE’s foreign affiliates were located; there will not be any FDI transactions
recorded in the countries of these foreign affiliates since they were already foreign–owned. The
acquiring MNE may choose not to change the ownership structure, in which case the acquisition creates
an ownership chain and the position in the reporting economy reflects not just the value of the assets
held in that economy but also the assets in the subsequent economies along the chain. In this form of
pass-through capital, the financial structure and operational structure could overlap, and, so, as for the
case of the reduction in transaction costs discussed above, the motivation may not represent what is
usually associated with pass-through capital but, nevertheless, the acquired MNE is now serving as a
pass-through entity for its new parent. 5
This form of pass through would be more likely to occur in countries where more of the inward FDI
transactions were the result of M&A than of greenfield investment and, more specifically, that are home
to MNEs that have since been acquired. It is hard to assess the impacts of this type of pass-through
capital on the host economy. While it may be expected that there would be a drop in employment and
value added at the former head of the MNE, it may still maintain significant operations there.
5) Protection of the parent from claims against the affiliate. If the parent is concerned that the affiliate
is exposing them to financial claims, they may be more likely to own it indirectly to limit those claims.
This might be the case, for example, with joint ventures or other cases of shared ownership. This might
be more likely to happen in host countries that provide greater protections to investors as discussed
above. It is hard to assess the impacts of this type of pass-through capital on the host economy. On the
one hand, it might be more associated with indirect impacts in the host economy if it is driven by
investor protection, but, on the other hand, enterprises that are joint ventures or in which the foreign
investor holds a minority stake could have significant employment, value added and so on.

1.2. Pass-through capital outside of the firm
1) External financing. MNEs can raise financing outside of the firm and may do this through their
foreign affiliates. For example, MNEs can use their foreign affiliates to raise capital by issuing debt
securities and then channel the funds raised to other parts of the MNE, including back to the parent.
The first part of this transaction is either domestic or portfolio investment, but the second part is an FDI
transaction. There is evidence that this activity is increasing, particularly for MNEs from emerging
5

The acquiring MNE could choose to change the ownership structure and hold these foreign affiliates directly, in
which case the FDI positions would be reclassified from the economy of the former parent to the economies of
the foreign affiliates. In this case, there would be no pass-through capital and the FDI statistics would accurately
reflect both the value and ultimate origin and destinations of the FDI.

6

market economies (Tarashev et al, 2016) and that it is tied to the presence of capital controls (Caballero
et al, 2015). 6 In this case, pass-through capital goes beyond FDI to include the other functional
categories of international investment, and, so, the concept of pass-through capital would need to be
broadened beyond FDI to address it.
This form of pass-through capital would be more likely in countries with deep capital markets, strong
investor protections, and offering sophisticated financial services. It would not have significant direct
impacts in the economy but could have significant indirect impacts in the financial services sector.
2) Financial conduits. A private investor may establish an affiliate in a foreign country for the purpose
of engaging in portfolio investment from the host economy. It is the first leg of this case that brings the
transaction within the scope of FDI, while the other leg would either be in domestic investment or in
the other functional categories of international investment. This kind of pass-through capital would be
more likely in countries that offer offshore or sophisticated financial services or secrecy. The home
country would likely be one with higher tax rates and that had stronger controls on outflows of portfolio
capital than on direct investment. It would not have significant direct impacts in the host economy but
could have significant indirect impacts in the financial services sector.
3) Corporate redomiciliations. In a corporate redomiciliation, the headquarters of the company moves
to another country. While they can take many forms, corporate redomiciliations often involve
substantial FDI flows that are almost completely, if not completely offset, by portfolio investment
flows. It is possible that these kinds of transactions, when they result in offsetting flows, could be treated
as a form of pass-through capital because the capital that has flown into the reporting economy flows
out to other economies. In this case, the characteristics that would make a country likely to host a
redomiciliation would be those offering relative tax, regulatory, and other benefits to foreign investors.
The extent of impacts on the host economy would depend on the extent to which the redomiciled
company actually shifted operations to its new headquarters country.

2. Defining pass-through capital and the ultimate partner country
The section begins with the definition of pass-through capital and ultimate partner country in FDI
positions. It then examines how these concepts could be extended to FDI income. Next, it discusses
implications for measuring pass-through capital in financial flows and for producing these statistics.

2.1. Pass-through capital in FDI positions
This section begins with the definition of pass-through capital in FDI positions illustrated by two
examples. It, then, discusses the conventions applied in these examples, and, next, it presents a
nationality-based consolidation that captures the entire financing of the MNE.
2.1.1. Pass-through capital and ultimate partner country
The concept of pass-through capital is straightforward: capital flowing into the host economy that is
then invested in a subsequent economy. However, identifying these flows in practice is more
complicated. Entities receive financing from a variety of sources and use it in a variety of ways,
especially operating affiliates, which can blur the relationship between inward and outward flows. As

6

Going further, Shin and Zhou (2013) find evidence of non-financial MNEs issuing liabilities in some countries
and currencies at the same time they acquire assets in other countries and currencies to generate profits.

7

a result, assumptions, necessarily, have to be made about the relationship between the financing and its
eventual use. 7
The definition in this paper is derived from the position data and is based on the concept of ultimate
ownership of the FDI assets. In FDI statistics, the inward position in a country reflects not just the
claims on the direct investment enterprise in that country but may also reflect foreign direct investments
that enterprise may have. This necessarily means that the outward investment position of a country
reflects investments made by entities headquartered in that country but also by enterprises that are
ultimately owned by investors in another country. Therefore, any reasonable definition of the UHC
would have to, in effect, remove the multiple-counting that results from pass-through capital (Mahoney,
2007). The removal of pass-through capital also has implications for statistics by UIC because, ideally,
statistics by UIC and UHC would be symmetric. Indeed, eliminating multiple-counting of pass-through
capital in constructing UIC statistics is preferable from a policy perspective as the ultimate goal of the
statistics is to identify the country of the investor influencing the investment in the host country.
However, as before, that influence is overstated if part of that investment is capital passing through the
host economy. In other words, the two ideas−pass-through capital and ultimate partner economy−are
ultimately and inextricably linked and should be considered together in order to produce complementary
FDI statistics that are more analytically meaningful.
Figure 2 below illustrates some of the challenges presented by pass-through capital in current FDI
statistics compilation, and how interpretability could be improved using the concept of UIC. It presents
the ownership diagram of a simple MNE structure consisting of five different enterprises in four
different economies; A (in Economy 1, the UIC) is the ultimate controlling parent (UCP), and it owns
B and C directly and D and E indirectly. For each entity and country, the figure shows an abridged
balance sheet consisting of total assets, with the equity investments in foreign affiliates broken out; total
liabilities; and owners' equity. The figure also shows the ownership chains and the percentage of
ownership.
Table 1 shows the inward and outward FDI positions that would be recorded under the extended
directional principle. Outward positions are allocated to the immediate partner country, but inward
positions are recorded on both the immediate country and UIC basis as recommended in BD4. 8
Table 1 shows that the inward and outward positions are globally additive, each summing to 340. But
the reallocation of inward positions to economy 1, (the UIC), results in a total of 340 being recorded by
economies 2, 3, and 4 as inward investment from economy 1, exceeding 1's total outward FDI of 250
due to pass-through capital. Moreover, under the extended directional principle, the loan between
fellow enterprises B and C is treated as a reduction in inward investment in B as the funds that flowed
into economy 2 from the fellow enterprises' common direct investor (enterprise A) have flowed to
another country (economy 3). This loan does not give B any influence over the operations of C, and,
so, should not be recorded as an outward investment. However, because it is recorded against the

7

As a result of these difficulties, BD4 chose to identify entities associated with pass-through capital rather than
to identify the flows themselves because it was thought to be more feasible. The criteria listed in BD4 to identify
SPEs−including little or no physical presence, foreign ownership, and almost all assets and liabilities of the
enterprise represent investments in or from other countries−were designed to identify entities for which almost all
of the FDI into and out of SPEs qualified as pass-through capital.
8
BD4 recommends that the UIC be identified by proceeding up the ownership chain of the immediate direct
investor until a unit that is not controlled by any other unit is reached.

immediate partner economy, it does lead to an asymmetry in the bilateral inward and outward FDI
positions reported by the two countries.

If the positions were also reallocated to the ultimate investing country, then economy 1 would still
report outward investment of 250 but, now, Economy 2 would recognise that both the loan of 100 to C
and the equity investment in D of 40 are pass-through capital and would net these from its inward and
outward investment and the remaining inward investment would remain allocated to economy 1, the
economy of the ultimate investor A. Economy 3 would also recognise that the equity investment of 50
in E is pass-through capital and net it from its inward and outward investment and the remaining inward

investment would be reallocated to economy 1. Economy 4 does not have pass-through capital and
would reallocate its inward position to economy 1. In this case, the only country with outward
investment is economy 1 since that is the economy of the domestic parent of the MNE; economies 2
and 3 no longer have outward investment since all of their outward investment was from A, the foreign
and ultimate controlling parent. As before, the statistics are globally additive but now the amount of
inward FDI attributed to Economy 1 (the UIC) is the same as its outward investment (250), reflecting
the elimination of pass-through capital.

While BD4 recommended a supplemental presentation of inward FDI positions by UIC, it also included
an item on the BD4 Research Agenda to develop a presentation by ultimate host country (UHC) as the
natural counterpart of the presentation by UIC. If we define the UHC as the country where the foreignowned assets are ultimately located and that the reallocation to UHC should be based on the total
intragroup funding that each foreign affiliate receives net of any intragroup funding it provides to fellow
enterprises or its subsidiaries, then the FDI positions by UHC can be derived from the inward statistics
by using mirror relationships.
Of course, ownership structures can be more complicated than presented in Figure 2. The first
complication is that FDI statistics cover influence as well as control relationships and, so, can include
multiple direct investors. The second difficulty is that FDI positions can be negative. Negative positions
usually result when the loans from the affiliate to its foreign parent group exceed the loans and equity
capital it has received. 9 The final difficulty is that MNEs can raise financing from outside of the group.
Figure 3 presents a more complicated ownership structure including these aspects. Each case will be
discussed more completely below as well as the measurement and identification challenges that they
raise.
In figure 3, there are 2 direct investors in enterprise E in economy 4, both from economy 3. Under the
recommendations in BD4 for the UIC, the 20% of equity held by enterprise Z would be attributed to
Economy 3, while the equity investment held by C would be reallocated to country 1 as would the loan
from enterprise B in economy 2. An alternative way to reallocate the FDI positions to the UIC is based
on who controls the enterprise rather than who owns the investment. The implications for this

9
Negative positions could also occur if the distributed earnings exceeded total earnings or the affiliate operated
at a loss, resulting in negative reinvested earnings.

change in identifying the Ultimate Investor will be discussed below. Enterprise B in economy 2 has a
minority ownership interest in enterprise D in economy 4, but, in this case, it is assumed that no other
investor owns more than 10% of the voting power, so there are no other direct investors. Enterprise B
plays an important role in the MNE's financing structure, borrowing money from some parts of the
MNE as well as from outside of the group and lending money to other parts of the MNE.
Table 3 presents the standard FDI statistics in the upper panel that would result from this ownership
structure, and there is a negative inward position in economy 2 from economies 1, 3, and 4 under the
extended directional principle resulting from the role that enterprise B plays in the internal financing of
the MNE. So under what circumstances does pass-through capital occur in the case of negative
positions? There are three possible cases to consider. First, if the inward position of enterprise B is
negative and its outward position is negative, then there has been pass-through capital, but it has gone
in the opposite direction. This is the case shown in figure 3; in this case, enterprise B has borrowed
more from its affiliate (enterprise D) than it invested and some of this financing contributes to the
financing that it provides to other parts of the MNE, including the parent. In the other two cases, there
is no pass-through capital. If the inward position in enterprise B is negative but its outward position is
positive, then the financing for the outward investment must have come from extra-group sources. This
would be the case, for example, if there had been no loan from enterprise D to B in figure 3. Similarly,
if the inward position in enterprise B had been positive but its outward position in D is negative, then
there has been no pass-through capital; in this case, the funding received by B from its parent has not
gone to its subsidiary, enterprise D.
To formalise, the amount of pass-through funding, PT, for each enterprise j in period t, is:
PTj,t= min(Ij,t,Oj,t) if the Ij,t ≥ 0 and Oj,t ≥ 0
= max(Ij,t,Oj,t) if the Ij,t < 0 and Oj,t < 0
= 0, otherwise

(1)
(2)
(3)

Where Ij,t and Oj,t represent the inward and outward positions of the direct investment enterprise j in
period t, respectively. Looking from the inward FDI perspective, a foreign-owned enterprise with no
subsidiaries would have no pass-through capital (Oj,t =0 under (1)). If it did have a foreign subsidiary,
the amount of pass-through capital is the smaller of the inward and outward positions of the foreignowned enterprise if both its positions are positive (under (1)) or negative (under (2)), and it is zero
otherwise. Looking from the outward FDI perspective, the same amount of pass-through would be
identified for direct investors in the economy. The total pass-through capital in the economy would be
found by either summing the pass-through capital across the direct investment enterprises or across the
direct investors in the economy. This follows one of the methods described in Leino and Yrrko (2014).
The bottom panel of table 3 shows the consolidated FDI statistics that would result from applying this
definition and reallocating positions to the ultimate partner country. Starting with economy 4, the
inward positions from B in economy 2 (the -60 in D resulting by netting the loan of 100 from the equity
investment of 40 plus the loan of 100 to E) and from C in economy 3 (equity investment of 40) are
reallocated to A in economy 1, but the investment from Z in economy 3 remains allocated to economy
3 because Z is not controlled by another entity. For economy 3, the pass-through capital from C to E is
deducted from its inward investment from A (100-40) and, along with the loan from B (100), is
reallocated to A; the outward investment from Z to E (10) remains as outward investment from economy
3 to economy 4. For economy 2, the negative outward investment to D (-60) is identified as pass-through
capital and is netted from the inward positions from A, C, and E (-250), for a total inward position of 190 allocated to A. For economy 1, there is no inward investment, but its outward investment identifies
12

the ultimate destination for its direct investment as well as the fact that enterprise A controls B and uses
it as a source of funding to the rest of the MNE.

Another complication arises if the MNE raises financing from outside of the group. This could include
any minority ownership interests from the reporting economy, as depicted by enterprise Z in economy
3, and funds raised from third parties that are then lent to other parts of the MNE group, as depicted in
the case of enterprise B.
2.1.2 Conventions in the Recording
There are conventions used in the method discussed above to compile the consolidated FDI positions.
Enterprises can receive financing from a number of different sources and can use that financing in a
number of different ways. Due to the fungible nature of capital, it is not possible to trace the source to
the use. As a result, it is necessary to make assumptions about how much of the FDI received by the
enterprise is used in local production and how much passes through. This is much more difficult for
operating affiliates than for SPEs.
Some proposed definitions have focused on applying shares of intragroup financing in total financing.
For example, one proposed definition of pass-through capital in Mahoney (2007) used the proportion
of the total liabilities (including shareholder's equity) of an enterprise that are equity liabilities to a direct
investor to determine the amount of its equity assets that should be deemed pass-through capital; so, if
one-third of the total liabilities of the enterprise were equity liabilities to its direct investor, then one
third of its direct investment equity assets were deemed to be pass-through capital. Other definitions
have included debt liabilities as well as equity (OECD, 2006). The assumption in these definitions is
that all sources of funding are used equally in all uses. In contrast, the assumption used in this paper is
that the intra-group financing is the primary source of funding for intra-group investments.
It is important to note that whichever of the estimation approaches used requires the use of conventions.
The preference for the approach (and underlying assumption) used in this paper largely reflects practical
reasons. First, it requires less information than those approaches that require information on the full
funding of the enterprise. Economies with entities lower in the chain would only need to know details
on the ownership shares and investments to and from the entities in their economy; only the country of
the UCP would need to have information on the complete chain. Second, basing the amount of passthrough capital on the share of total financing could result in volatility as the share changes due to
13

increases or decreases in the amount of total financing needed by the enterprise but with no change in
the underlying intrafirm financing. Potentially introducing such volatility in measured FDI is arguably
contrary to the goal of measuring stable, long-term financing. Finally, it is in keeping with the extended
directional principle in which the full amount of the loan between fellow enterprises is netted from the
inward investment of fellows making the loan. The result of the assumption that intragroup financing
is the primary source of funding for intragroup investments is that more of the direct investment
positions are reallocated to the entities at the end of the chain compared to the assumption that all
sources of funding contribute to the intragroup lending.
The second convention that has been used is that the reallocation to the UIC is based on the country of
the entity that controls the immediate direct investor; alternatively, it could be based on who controls
the direct investment enterprise. When moving to focusing on control of the direct investment
enterprises, it makes sense to move to examining only control relationships in the consolidation of the
financing structure of the MNE; that is, the definition of FDI covering both influence and control
relationships would need to be changed to only control relationships. Table 4 presents the results of the
consolidated FDI statistics with only control relationships.

One change is that the investment from Z in economy 3 to E in economy 4 is no longer shown because
it is not a control relationship. Similarly, the investment by B in economy 2 in D in economy 4 nor the
loan from D to B are included since it is not a control relationship. One thing this highlights is the tradeoff in focusing only on control of the enterprise—the information on minority investors is no longer
captured in the data.
2.1.3. Expanding Consolidated FDI Statistics to Capture the Full Financing of the MNE
It is instructive to note that consolidated FDI statistics by UIC fits in with the broader thrust towards,
and greater interest in, the use of nationality based statistics for understanding globalisation across a
number of statistical areas, such as recommendations included in the G20 Data Gaps Initiative for more
nationality-based statistics to better understand financial integration and monitor financial stability
(Bank for International Settlements, 2015 and Tissot, 2016). In addition a full nationality-based
approach could allow the statistics to be expanded to capture other sources of financing to better
represent the full economic involvement of the foreign investor in the host economy. Indeed, the
framework for consolidated FDI statistics discussed here can be extended to the total assets and
liabilities of the MNE. This expansion goes beyond FDI statistics by capturing the cross-border assets
and liabilities from other functional categories, especially portfolio and other investments, but also
beyond the international accounts by capturing domestic assets and liabilities. Nevertheless, it can be
underpinned by the Framework for Direct Investment Relationships (FDIR) to identify the relevant
units to be consolidated as well as the ultimate investor.
14

The expansion would reveal the extent to which MNEs have leveraged their direct investment to control
more assets in the host economy. The difference between the direct investment figures (positions) and
the actual value of assets the foreign parent firm controls in the host economy can measure the extent
of this leverage. The framework can also be harmonised with the concepts underlying the Activities
(AMNE) or Foreign AffiliaTe Statistics (FATS) so that the two data sets can be linked to analyse the
relationship between the operations of MNEs and their financing. These statistics could also be linked
to datasets developed to explore the competitiveness of economies by allocating value added not by
location but instead by ownership of the firms and of the factors involved in production (Federico,
2015). Such a linking would shed light on the role that FDI plays in the competitiveness of economies.
The Working Group on International Investment Statistics (WGIIS) developed a framework for
harmonising the concepts and definitions used in FDI and FATS statistics as well as to capture the full
financing of the MNE. Called the MNE Framework, it focuses on control relationships and uses rules
like the consolidation rules used in international accounting standards to identify intragroup assets. The
MNE Framework recommended expanding the coverage of financial variables to total assets and
liabilities. So, these statistics would include FDI but would go beyond it to include purely domestic
sources of financing and cross-border sources other than FDI. This expansion recognizes that all of the
funding received by the enterprise, not just FDI, affects its operations.
Next, the MNE framework made use of the Ultimate Controlling Parent (UCP) concept from the FDIR
to classify investment and to define the entities to be covered. The UCP is the entity on top of the
ownership chain and which is not controlled by another entity. For inward investment, the MNE
framework recommended allocating all variables to the country of the UCP. Not only does this align
with the recommendation for a supplemental presentation of FDI statistics by UIC, but it also aligns
with the recommendations for compiling AMNE/FATS statistics. For outward investment, it
recommends that the entities covered include only non-resident subsidiaries that are controlled by UCPs
resident in the reporting economy. That is, it removes from the outward investment of a country
investments made by entities that are resident in the economy and that are in turn themselves foreigncontrolled. This prevents overestimation of the amount of overseas assets under control.
Finally, the MNE framework recommended that the financial measures be consolidated for the group
to eliminate the double-counting of funds in transit or round-tripping. This consolidation is done by
netting investments between the affiliates of the group from the group’s total assets and is equivalent to
the methods discussed above. This consolidation not only removes fund that go into and out of
subsidiaries simultaneously (funds-in-transit) but also removes funds that have been invested by
subsidiaries in other affiliated enterprises on behalf of the UCP; the funds removed corresponds to the
definition of pass-through capital proposed in this paper. For a complete description of the method, see
OECD (2011) and OECD (2015).
The results of expanding the presentation to the full financing of the MNE are presented in Table 5.
Table 5 presents the assets that enterprise A controls in each economy. The amount of total assets in
column 1 overstates the total assets controlled by A due to intragroup positions, so column (2) identifies
the amount of intragroup assets, and column (3) identifies the consolidated assets of A by netting these
intragroup positions from the total assets.

The total financing reveals the extent to which A has leveraged its direct investment (in column (4)) to
control a much larger amount of assets. It also reveals the extent to which it relies on extragroup
financing (column (5), broken out between equity (6) and debt (7)). This includes both the equity in A
itself as well as the equity investment that enterprise Z has in enterprise E. It also reveals the extent of
debt at A's foreign subsidiaries, particularly the reliance on extragroup financing through its subsidiary
B.
It is important to note that the nationality/group consolidated statistics are not a substitute for, but rather
a complement to, the residency-based financial statistics. The residency-based FDI statistics capture
cross-border intra-group financing and are a starting point to analysing the international exposures of
MNEs. However, it is not a complete picture because the MNE parent controls assets and incurs
liabilities through its foreign affiliates. Residency-based financial statistics are useful to know where
financial claims and liabilities are created and held. However, to know who makes the underlying
decisions, who reaps the benefits, and who takes on the risk and needs to hold sufficient capital to cover
potential losses, data are needed on a nationality basis.

2.2. Income-in-transit
Just as capital can flow down an MNE ownership structure, income can flow up it. The same concept
of pass-through capital used for positions can be used for FDI income: income-in-transit is the FDI
income a foreign-owned parent receives from its foreign affiliates. In the same way therefore, bilateral
income-in-transit flows can exaggerate the degree of interdependence between partners and give a
misleading picture of the importance that productive activity (in particular with respect to GDP) in one
country (and its resident affiliates) makes to the generation of income in another (especially the parent).
In addition it blurs the ability to identify where the income was generated within an MNE, and so, in
turn, hampers analyses of GVCs and also our understanding of potential income shifting occurring
under BEPS.

But by netting flows between affiliated enterprises it is possible to derive a meaningful estimate of the
actual FDI income generated within the host economy (as opposed to the total income passing through).
Figure 4 presents a simple example of an MNE ownership structure with three economies to illustrate
this. For each entity, an abridged income statement showing their total income, total costs, and net
income is shown; additionally, under the total income, the amount of that income that represents income
resulting from their equity investments in other parts of the MNE, called "Income from foreign
affiliates", is shown. Table 6 shows the FDI income that would be reported by immediate partner
country in standard FDI statistics and the consolidated FDI statistics by ultimate partner country.
As with the positions, the total amount of income recorded in the consolidated statistics is equal to the
earnings of the MNE from its foreign operations, and, so, the double-counting resulting from incomein-transit has been removed. The amounts shown for income payments for economies 2 and 3 represent
the income generated within their economies and are allocated to economy 1, who ultimately has the
claim on the earnings.

17

2.3. Pass-through capital in financial flows
Another method that FDI statisticians have used to produce estimates of pass-through capital in
response to the concerns expressed by data users is to identify the capital coming into and passing out
of a direct investment enterprise in the same period (Kocerka and Makowski (2017) and Montvai
(2016)). As Blanchard and Acalin (2016) noted, these estimates do not appear to completely resolve the
problem of pass-through capital. An important issue that arises when trying to identify capital coming
into and going out of the same enterprise is timing. As the Swiss National Bank (2017) noted in its
analysis of pass-through capital, it can be a gradual process.
Another issue is that the method of identifying flows going in and out will not identify pass-through
capital resulting from the acquisition of domestic MNEs (as discussed above). The acquisition of a
domestic MNE can involve a significant inward FDI flow but much of this could represent funds to
purchase assets in other countries that are part of the MNE; since they are already owned by the domestic
parent, there would be no subsequent outflows to those foreign affiliates associated with this transaction.
For example, in 2016, when Annheuser Busch InBev acquired SAB Miller for USD 103 billion, there
was a large inflow to the United Kingdom, where SAB Miller was headquartered, but much of those
funds were payment for the operations of SAB Miller outside of the United Kingdom; there were no
outflows from the United Kingdom or inflows to those countries because the assets were already
foreign-owned. Defining pass-through capital as is done in this paper would recognise that a substantial
portion of that inward flow was for foreign assets and would produce a smaller estimate of genuine FDI
to the United Kingdom from that transaction. Leino and Yrkko (2014) provide a good example of the
impact this can have on measures of pass-through capital as they measure pass-through capital based
on positions 10 as well as according to the difference between inflows and outflows to direct investment
enterprises in a given year. They find that between 2002 and 2011, the accumulated pass-through flows
were €5.7 billion, but the increase in the stock of pass-through investments was almost €12 billion.
They attribute this difference to the acquisitions of Finnish MNEs by foreign investors.
In theory, the definition of pass-through capital in financial flows can be derived from the pass-through
positions because the change in these positions between two periods would be the result of valuation
changes and pass-through financial flows. However, the interpretation of these flows would be
complicated because there would not necessarily be any flows recorded in the standard FDI statistics
due to differences in timing.

2.4. Producing consolidated FDI statistics
The statistics separately identifying pass-through capital could be produced by FDI statisticians by
linking the inward and outward FDI position and income statistics at the micro level. The compilers
would then be able to see the outward positions and income receipts and inward positions and income
payments for foreign-owned parents and to calculate how much of the position is located and income
is generated within the economy rather than passing through. As a first step, and subject to the usual
confidentiality restrictions, countries could identify the FDI outward position and income receipts of all
foreign-owned parents, and not just SPEs, in their outward investment statistics. Then, data users
interested in identifying the pass-through capital and income in transit could use this published
information. The Austrian Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank already publish such statistics.

10
Their preferred measure of pass-through capital adjusts for the source of funding by using the portion of FDI
liabilities in total liabilities to determine the amount of pass-through capital.

18

2.4.1. Differentiating different types of pass-through capital
The definition of pass-through capital proposed here would cover all of the types of pass-through capital
within the firm discussed in the taxonomy discussed above (section 1.1). However, some of those types
can have significant impacts on the host economy while others will not. Therefore, it could be useful to
differentiate between these different types. However, it is not possible for the statistician to ask the
motivation behind the pass-through capital to determine what type it is. It is also possible that passthrough capital serves several purposes within the MNE structure at the same time. As such, it may not
be possible to completely differentiate between all of the different types. Given the motivation for
separately identifying pass-through capital is to derive better measures to understand the impact of FDI
on an economy, the total pass-through capital within the firm could be divided into two categories. The
first is that with little direct impact on the host economy but that could have significant indirect impacts
on specific sectors of the economy, including financial, legal and tax planning services. This category
would include FDI for tax avoidance, expropriation or “political” risk, and protection from claims
against the parent. The second category is that which is likely to involve more real economic activity in
the host economy and would include pass-through capital associated with reducing transactions costs
and inherited ownership structures.
Distinguishing between these two broad categories would involve looking at some characteristics of the
enterprises involved to gauge the importance of real versus financial activity in the enterprise, such as
assets per employee, tangible assets per employee, importance of royalties and license fee income in
total income, and economic activity, It would also be possible to look at the characteristics of the country
involved, such as whether it offers preferential tax rates; protections to foreign investors, such as
through investment treaties or equivalent arrangements; and whether it has deep capital markets and a
large financial services sector. Because these forms of pass-through capital take place within the firm,
they could be addressed solely within FDI statistics.
For pass-through capital that goes outside the firm (section 1.2), there is a need to look beyond the
intrafirm transactions to other functional categories to define pass-through capital. Such a definition is
beyond the scope of this paper. However, as a first step, it is possible to think about a set of statistics
that capture the full financing of the MNE, both internal and external, that could be the basis for
considering pass-through capital that comes from outside of the firm. The concepts and definitions of
such a set of statistics are discussed further below.
2.4.2. Attribution to the Ultimate Partner Country
To compile the statistics by UIC, the inward positions (with pass-through capital removed) could be
reallocated as recommended in BD4 for traditional FDI statistics. BD4 recommends that the UIC be
determined by the country of the entity that ultimately controls the investment by proceeding up the
direct investor’s ownership chain, until an entity that is not controlled by another entity is reached. This
is akin to the ultimate beneficial owner (UBO) of the investment, and the UBO is generally considered
to be the best concept for use with financial statistics. However, there are alternative concepts. One of
the most well-known is the Ultimate Controlling Investor used in AMNE/FATS statistics. The Ultimate
Controlling Investor is the entity that controls the direct investment enterprise. For some countries, the
information on the country of the Ultimate Controlling Investor is available and can be used relatively
easily to generate FDI statistics by ultimate investor. However, because the Ultimate Controlling
Investor is only available for majority-controlled enterprises, it cannot be used for attributing minority
investments to the ultimate investor.
The determination of the nationality of MNEs is becoming more difficult as more and more companies
separate their global headquarters from their operational headquarters. For example, Shire Plc, a large
19

pharmaceutical firm, has its Group Headquarters in Ireland, its International Operational Headquarters
in Switzerland, and its Registered Office in Jersey. 11 The global group headquarters generally follow
the ownership structure and may be chosen for fiscal optimisation or other benefits. On the other hand,
the operational headquarters would reflect where the decisions are made. The EuroGroups Register
includes these two concepts: the Global Group Head is defined as a “parent legal unit, which is not
controlled by any other legal unit… the global group head is the group head of the multinational
enterprise group,” and the Global Decision Centre is defined as “the unit where the strategic decisions
referring to an enterprise group are taken.” (Eurostat, 2012).
Unlike the case for determining the UIC, where countries only need to collect information on the
ultimate parent, the presentation by UHC is more problematic as it would require additional information
on how flows/positions are channelled through countries, requiring some form of cross-border statistical
collaboration or data collection for the MNE and all of its affiliates in the compiling country. Very few
countries currently collect these data as either part of their FDI or FATS data collections. However,
initiatives by international organisations, such as the Eurogroups Register, the U.N. Global Group
Register, the Eurostat initiative on profiling large and complex MNEs, and the forthcoming OECD
ADIMA database (OECD, 2018), could provide important information to compilers to help them
reallocate their outward positions to the UHC as well as to reallocate inward positions to the UIC. The
use of common registers would also help to ensure that all countries are using the same information
when doing the reallocation.
The presentation of consolidated FDI positions by ultimate partner country could be extended to the
related FDI income receipts and payments. This would be very useful information for the analysis of
where income is generated along GVCs and where it accrues.

3. Estimates of pass-through capital and its key characteristics
3.1. Estimates of the prevalence of pass-through capital
To assess the importance of pass-through capital through operating affiliates one needs good quality
firm level microdata. Such information, covering the entire activity of an MNE and its affiliates across
borders, is not typically available or publishable by national statistics authorities. However, Bureau van
Dijk's Orbis database provides financial information on enterprises in 158 countries and also includes
detailed information on their ownership structure. So, it is possible to use these data to derive broad
estimates of the extent of pass-through capital using the methods described above.
For this exercise, Orbis data for some of the European members of the OECD were examined to assess
the extent of capital passing through ‘operating entities’ (as opposed to SPEs) as most of these countries
already produce FDI statistics that separately identify the FDI associated with SPEs. 12 The data
appendix provides detail on the data from Orbis and how it was used to identify non-SPE entities
potentially used to pass capital to other parts of the MNE.
To estimate the importance of pass-through capital, the first step is to identify all of the direct investors
in Orbis from a country and to calculate the total amount of shareholders’ funds these direct investors
11

It was decided to focus on European countries as they are generally considered to have among the best coverage
in Orbis. Data were used for the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,
Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

hold in their foreign subsidiaries; entities that appear to be SPEs are dropped from the Orbis sample to
focus on capital passing through operating affiliates. Once all of the enterprises with foreign subsidiaries
were identified, their ownership percentage in their foreign subsidiaries was multiplied by the
shareholders’ funds to estimate the equity claim the direct investors had on the subsidiaries. Then, equity
claims tied to the same enterprise group were aggregated at the shareholder level.
The next step is to use the information on the Global Ultimate Owner (GUO) included in Orbis to
identify the direct investors in the country that are, in fact, ultimately controlled by an investor in another
country. For these foreign-owned parents, the different options for the direction of pass-through (or
zero-pass-through) were evaluated as in equations (1) to (3). Data was summed across firms for each
country, and the ratio of pass-through equity over total equity for its resident direct investors was
derived. Then, this ratio (calculated from the Orbis data) is applied to the official outward FDI statistics
of the country to develop an estimate of the total amount of pass-through capital in the economy. The
official FDI statistics used exclude resident SPEs to focus on the pass-through capital through operating
affiliates.
This provides a broad estimate of the amount of pass-through capital in the economy. These estimates
are broad partly because they rely on certain assumptions as highlighted above but also for other
reasons. First, they only consider equity and not debt because the Orbis data do not provide information
on intragroup lending. As such, the estimates assume that debt financing follows the same pass-through
pattern as equity financing. Second, the method used to drop possible SPEs from the Orbis data was
based only on industry codes and, thus, likely captured some non-SPEs while also missing some SPEs
in other cases. Finally, it is not known how representative the samples are for each country. Overall, the
sample from Orbis covered about one-quarter of the outward positions of the countries examined. The
coverage of outward investment by region varied, reflecting differences in country coverage in Orbis;
the coverage of outward investment to the European region tended to be higher than other regions. The
Data Appendix provides information on coverage by country. Nevertheless, the goal was only to give
an indication of how important the phenomenon of pass-through capital is.
Table 7 presents evidence for 2015 on the importance of pass-through capital for each country. The first
column is the estimate of pass-through capital through operating affiliates estimated as described above;
it is presented as a share of the total inward position in the country excluding resident SPEs. To compare
to the importance of pass-through capital through SPEs, the last column shows the share of SPEs in the
total inward investment position of each country as reported in their official statistics. 13
Only a few countries have published information that can serve as a basis for comparison to these
estimates. Switzerland is the most problematic as the Swiss National Bank estimates that 53 percent of
the inward position in 2016 is pass-through capital under a broad definition that capture both SPEs and
operating affiliates (Swiss National Bank, 2017). This could be because the coverage of Swiss
companies in Orbis is not representative. For Austria, the estimates look reasonable as the Austrian
Central Bank estimated that about half of the inward FDI position, excluding SPEs, represented passthrough capital in 2012 (Austrian Central Bank, 2015). This could reflect Austria's role as a gateway to
investment in Central and Eastern Europe (Cernohous, 2017). As mentioned above, Leino and Yrrko
(2014) estimate that about 28 percent of the inward investment position is pass-through, so the estimate
here looks a little low. For Ireland, the Central Statistics Office estimates that foreign-owned direct
13

Countries with 0% of outward investment accounted for by SPEs either do not host SPEs or they are
insignificant. Data on SPEs are currently not available for Ireland; the United Kingdom publishes FDI statistics
on SPEs with its annual detailed statistics but not the aggregate statistics, making it difficult to reconcile the data
when there are differences in vintages between the two sets of statistics.

21

investors accounted for about two-thirds of FDI liabilities in 2014 (Lane, 2015). The estimate in table
7 is lower, but it should be noted that their estimate includes liabilities in Ireland as well as pass-through
liabilities. In addition, the estimated share from Orbis excluded SPEs but the FDI position includes
resident SPEs, so pass-through via SPEs may not be accounted for in the estimate.

The extent of pass-through capital varies significantly across countries. Figure 5 plots the values in table
7 sorted by the share of resident SPEs in the inward position of countries. Some countries with
significant presence of SPEs, such as Luxembourg, Hungary and the Netherlands, also have high rates
of capital passing through operating affiliates as MNEs find it beneficial to take advantage of the
benefits that these countries offer through their operating affiliates as well as by establishing SPEs. For
other countries, including Austria, Denmark and Belgium, we estimate a greater amount of pass-through
in operating affiliates than in SPEs. Some countries with little or no presence of SPEs have significant
pass-through capital through operating affiliates, including Greece, Italy, and France.
Figure 6 presents the total inward FDI positions for these countries between 2007 and 2015; the dark
blue bars represent the standard inward FDI positions excluding resident SPEs as reported to the OECD.
The light blue bars represent the consolidated FDI positions as estimated in this paper. Overall, the
consolidated positions are about one-quarter lower than the standard positions. They also grew less over
the period: the 2015 consolidated position is 51 percent higher than the 2007 position while the 2015
22

standard FDI position is 58 percent higher than the 2007 position, indicating that pass-through capital
could have been growing faster than 'real' FDI.

3.2. Key features of pass-through entities
One conclusion from section 1 is that pass-through entities may differ from their purely domestic
counterparts, especially in terms of the size of their balance sheets as their pass-through activities would
tend to increase the size of their financial assets and liabilities. In addition, given the different
motivations for pass-through, MNEs from some countries may be more likely to employ complex
ownership structures than from other countries. Data from Orbis can shed light on these issues by
describing patterns in the types of entities involved in pass-through as well as the origin of pass-through
countries globally.
In the Orbis sample, it is possible to compare the pass-through entities (that is, foreign-owned parents)
to the purely domestic parents. As Figure 7 shows, pass-through entities had about 50% higher fixed
assets per employee than purely domestic parent companies, but their total assets per employee were
more than two times higher in 2015. This is consistent with these entities having much larger financial
assets. When examining the data by country, this pattern held in only half of the countries in the sample,
but the results are not shown given concerns about the small sample sizes for some countries due to
missing employment data in Orbis.

The data in Orbis can also provide information on the country of the Ultimate Investor of the MNE
Group. An examination of these data reveals that US MNEs appear to be more involved in pass-through
activity than MNEs from other countries. For example, in 2015, US-owned MNEs accounted for about
25 percent of all pass-through firms in the countries examined and for about 32 percent of capital (Figure
8). This is not surprising given the complexity of the ownership structures of some US MNEs. The
practical impact of this is that while FDI statistics by immediate partner country would understate the
importance of the United States as an investor, the reallocation of the inward position to the UIC would
overstate the importance of the United States because some of that position represents funds passing
through the economy. Japan, the Netherlands and other large economies in Europe are the next most
24

significant sources of pass-through capital. Looking at the earlier years (annex D), the composition and
shares of UICs have stayed largely unchanged, with the exception of the United Kingdom which had a
more marked presence in 2007 (17%) than it has in 2015 (5%). 14

4. Related Statistics and Measurement Issues
This section begins by examining some related sets of statistics, including consolidated statistics as well
as those on the operations of MNEs and on international investment. Then, it will examine some
measurement issues that are relevant to consolidated FDI statistics but also more broadly, including
determining the value and location of intangible assets.

4.1. Related statistics
The Bank for International Settlements publishes two sets of nationality-based statistics. The first of
these is the Consolidated Banking Statistics (CBS). The CBS are collected by the country where the
international bank is headquartered. While the consolidation practices vary across countries, the CBS
includes claims of the bank's foreign affiliates but removes the intragroup positions. The statistics are
presented on both an immediate counterparty basis as well as on an ultimate risk basis. For example, if
a German bank makes a loan to a Canadian company that was guaranteed by a United States entity,
then Canada would be the immediate counterparty while the United States would be the country of
ultimate risk. The BIS also compiles the International Debt Securities on a nationality basis so that debt
securities of foreign affiliates are attributed to the country where the MNE is headquartered. These

14

It should be remarked that while the UK share in equity pass–through drops substantially from 2007 to 2015,
the percentage of direct investment enterprises that the country ultimately controls in the sample does not vary
in the same way (6.6% in 2007 and 6.7% in 2015, as shown in section C of annex D).

25

statistics demonstrate the contribution of nationality-based and consolidated statistics to the analysis
and monitoring of financial developments.
Statistics on the activities of MNEs (AMNE/FATS statistics) are closely related to FDI statistics. To
determine if the consolidating FDI statistics provided better measures of the FDI into an economy that
is having a real impact on the host economy, the correlations between the inward FDI positions
excluding resident SPEs and key measures of the activities of MNEs—employment, turnover, and value
added—were compared to the correlations with the consolidated FDI statistics. Overall, consolidating
the FDI positions yields better alignment with activity measures. Considering employment data from
AMNE/FATS, for example, the R-squared with FDI positions improves from 0.73 to 0.86 after
consolidation (see Figure 9). Improvements in the correlation are particularly large in Belgium, Finland,
Germany, Portugal, and Sweden. In contrast, in the Netherlands, Ireland, and to a lesser extent,
Hungary, and Luxembourg, the relationship between employment and FDI positions loses strength
when taking pass-through into consideration.

Similarly, the analysis of FDI positions against turnover and value added data from AMNE/FATS also
shows increased alignment. For turnover (top panel of figure 10), the R-Squared shows only a slight
improvement, from 0.86 to 0.89, after consolidating, while for value added (bottom panel), the
relationship improves from 0.80 to 0.88. Once again, the improvement in correlation was substantial in
some countries. For turnover, consolidation increased the R-squared for Estonia and Spain while for
value added, Denmark and Hungary both show a particularly stronger alignment with FATS.
The correlations between changes in the positions and changes in the activity measures were also
examined to determine if changes in the consolidated statistics could provide a better indication of
where MNE activity is increasing or decreasing than the traditional FDI statistics. However, the
correlations were very weak with both sets of FDI statistics, and the results were mixed. This could be
because changes in FDI positions reflect not only investment flows that could be associated with
changes in MNE activities but also changes in valuation.

The correlations between changes in the positions and changes in the activity measures were also
examined to determine if changes in the consolidated statistics could provide a better indication of
where MNE activity is increasing or decreasing than the traditional FDI statistics. However, the
correlations were very weak with both sets of FDI statistics, and the results were mixed. This could be
because changes in FDI positions reflect not only investment flows that could be associated with
changes in MNE activities but also changes in valuation.
As noted in section 2.1.3, the WGIIS developed a framework to harmonise and align the definitions,
concepts, and classifications used for FDI and AMNE/FATS statistics so that they could be used
together. Use of this framework would likely further enhance the alignment between the two sets of
statistics by not only focusing on the same populations but also by providing better measures of the full
involvement of the MNE in the host economy.
Trade in Value Added (TiVA) statistics were developed in response to the growth of global value chains
(GVCs) and increased globalisation. These statistics focus on the value added in each country in the
production of goods and services that are traded. TiVA statistics identify the domestic value added of a
country that ends up in foreign final demand as well as the ultimate destination for that domestic value
added; similarly, they identify the foreign value added in domestic final demand as well as the ultimate
source of that value added. These statistics have provided important insights into the economic relations
between countries that could be obscured by the increasing complexity and globalisation of economic
production (OECD and World Trade Organisation, 2015).
The OECD has been developing a methodology to integrate FDI income statistics into the TiVA
Framework to understand where the income is generated along GVCs and where that income accrues
(OECD, 2016). This work highlighted the limitations in FDI statistics that inhibited their use for such
27

globalisation analysis, including income-in-transit and the presentation by immediate rather than
ultimate partner country. The consolidated FDI statistics proposed in this paper address these issues and
should enhance the integration of FDI statistics into TiVA and the ensuing analysis.

4.2. Some remaining measurement issues
The methodology proposed in this paper relies on being able to identify where the assets of the MNE
are located so that the consolidated view of the MNE can be attributed to specific economies. While
this is usually straightforward for tangible assets with some exceptions, it is much more difficult for
intangible assets. MNEs can move their intangible assets to economies that offer advantages, such as
concessional tax rates, while continuing to use these assets in their production in other countries. The
determination of the location of intangible assets within MNEs is not straightforward (UNECE, 2015).
Improved guidance on determining the location of intangible assets using economic rather than legal
ownership would enable better recording of transactions and positions in intangible assets in FDI
statistics. In addition, the framework developed here could be used to present the recording of intangible
assets on an ownership, or nationality, basis rather than residency basis.
The value of intangible assets also poses difficulties for FDI statisticians. Market values are considered
to be the appropriate valuation for FDI positions. However, in practice, market values are only available
for a small portion of FDI positions because most of the equity of direct investment enterprises is not
listed. As such, it is necessary for FDI statisticians to estimate market values. The international
guidelines offer several methods for doing this (see Annex 10 in OECD, 2008), but most of these
methods exclude intangible assets from these market value estimates. For example, the most common
method used, Own Funds at Book Value, relies on the accounting records of the direct investment
enterprise kept according to International Financial Reporting Standards. These standards do not
include the revaluation of intangible assets. Better methods to estimate market values of FDI positions
would improve the comparability across functional categories in the BOP and IIP statistics as well as
better reflect the important contribution of intangibles to the value of corporations, particularly MNEs,
and to global production arrangements.
Another phenomenon that has affected FDI statistics is the decision by MNEs to move their
headquarters to new countries to take advantage of benefits from the relocation, such as lower taxes.
This phenomenon, sometimes called redomiciliation, can result in significant FDI flows that are almost
completely offset by portfolio investment flows (Irish Central Statistics Office, 2016); in addition, there
is likely very little change in the actual operations of the MNE. It is possible that the methods used here
to identify pass-through capital in FDI could be extended to portfolio investment to encompass these
transactions. By doing so, the flows and positions associated with these transactions could be eliminated
from the consolidated FDI statistics to reflect their limited impact on the economies involved.

5. Potential Policy Issues
Consolidated FDI statistics by ultimate partner economy would have many uses. First, they would
provide better measures of financial integration between economies. By eliminating pass-through
capital, the statistics would represent true financial integration and not financial intermediation between
countries. In addition, the statistics by ultimate partner would provide better bilateral statistics for
understanding the financial linkages between specific countries. These statistics could be used to
analyse how a wide range of policies, such as trade and investment agreements and tax policies, are
related to pass-through FDI or to true financial integration between countries and would help us better
understand the financial interdependencies between countries.

28

Second, to the extent that pass-through capital responds to tax considerations, changes in tax policy can
have significant impacts on FDI flows and positions but these changes may not be associated with any
real changes in their operations as they only affect the ownership structure and not their actual
operations (Foley et al, 2011). With recent or forthcoming tax policy changes in several countries,
including the United States, these statistics would allow for the analysis of trends in genuine FDI
separately from those related to fiscal optimisation by MNEs. In broader terms, these statistics would
enable a better analysis of the factors that attract FDI. Economists usually distinguish the factors that
drive FDI, such as market-seeking behaviour or factor cost differences, from those that drive portfolio
investment, such as monetary policy or the business cycle. Yet, Blanchard and Acalin (2016) found that
the factors usually considered drivers of portfolio investment flows were more highly correlated with
FDI flows to emerging markets than to portfolio investment flows to those markets. They hypothesized
that this was due to pass-through capital, so consolidated FDI statistics, from which the pass-through
capital has been eliminated, should enable a better analysis of the drivers of FDI.
Third, these statistics would allow for better monitoring of commitments made under international
agreements, such as free trade agreements, in the area of investment by enabling the monitoring of
changes in the amount of assets in the reference economy owned by the partner country. In addition,
they could also be used to monitor the contribution of FDI from advanced economies to financing other
international initiatives, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the transition to a
carbon neutral economy, and official development assistance. In particular, having FDI statistics that
reflect the extent of FDI in the ultimate host country would allow us to better link FDI with outcomes
on the SDGs, such as job creation or gender equality.
Fourth, the statistics would enable better analyses of the impact of globalisation on an economy. A key
use of the statistics, for example, could be to integrate them into the extension of the Trade in Value
Added (TiVA) Framework that incorporates primary income flows. Because the new statistics would
more accurately measure the ‘real’ FDI income generated within an economy and the ultimate
destination of that income, they are better related to the underlying value added generated within a given
period and so are better equipped to identifying where income is generated in a global value chain
(GVC) and where it ultimately accrues. Moreover, by distinguishing outward FDI positions between
purely domestic parent companies and foreign-owned parent companies, the statistics would provide
essential information to quantifying the benefits to home countries of their ownership of foreign
production facilities.
The expanded statistics that capture intra-group as well as extra-group financing and that reflect the
nationality of the firms would also have several uses. For example, these statistics could be linked to
AMNE/FATS statistics to analyse the relationship between MNEs' operations and their financing; this
would be especially valuable if the statistics are expanded to capture the total financing of the MNE.
Such linked statistics could show, for example, if foreign-owned firms can tap into intragroup financing
in times of financial crises in the host countries, thus contributing to the resilience of these economies.
Similarly, it could show how crises in the home countries affect the operations of their foreign affiliates.
It could also show how well aligned MNEs activities are with where they attribute the income, shedding
light on profit-shifting.
Finally, these statistics would help to monitor the cross-border exposure of MNEs. A true nationality,
or ownership-based approach, to measuring the cross-border exposures of MNEs would include
borrowing by the foreign subsidiaries of MNEs from unaffiliated parties, either domestic or foreign.
Expanding the measures beyond FDI to capture the total assets of the group would provide a more
complete picture of the economic involvement of the group as well as its cross-border and local
29

exposures. The nationality approach recognises that the headquarters controls many of the decisions
taken by the firm. This means that some aspects of the operations of the foreign-owned firm may
respond more to home country policies than host country policies. Differentiating between domestic
and foreign-owned entities is necessary to understand who ultimately bears the risk (Lane, 2015).
Consolidation would also be a step to developing a consolidated measure of the wealth of nations for
their non-financial corporations.

6. Conclusion and Next Steps
MNEs play a central role in the creation and management of complex production networks. However,
FDI statistics reflect not just the FDI associated with these networks but also other factors, such as fiscal
optimisation to reduce tax burdens and the increasing sophistication in MNEs' capital structures. This
can make it difficult to interpret FDI statistics in the sense that they are not ‘real’ and provide little in
the way of “long-term” investments in a country. When MNEs channel investments through several
countries, FDI flows and positions may be ‘inflated’ because each flow into and out of each country is
counted even if the capital, or income, is just passing through. Moreover, this behaviour can further
obscure the ultimate source and destination of FDI when the statistics are compiled by immediate
partner country.
This paper proposed a method to compile consolidated FDI statistics that removes pass-through capital.
Estimates of the amount of pass-through capital in operating affiliates for a selection of European
members of the OECD were derived using data from the Orbis database. These estimates indicate that
the amount of pass-through capital in operating affiliates, rather than in SPEs, is quite extensive,
accounting for about one-quarter of the inward FDI positions excluding resident SPEs in a selection of
European countries. It also appears that pass-through capital is growing faster than the 'real' FDI.
Future research will focus first on estimating pass-through capital for a greater number of countries. In
addition, the possibility that information on the nationality of the MNE group could be introduced into
the estimates will also be explored. These nationality-based statistics would be a complement to the
residency-based FDI statistics. While residency-based financial statistics are useful to know where
financial claims and liabilities are created and held, nationality based statistics provide information on
who makes the underlying decisions, reaps the benefits, and takes on the risk and needs to hold sufficient
capital to cover potential losses. These statistics would be useful for better measuring financial
integration and the links between economies as well as possibly being used in conjunction with statistics
on the operations of MNEs to analyse the relationship between the financing of MNEs and their
operations. Whether it is possible to differentiate pass-through capital that has little direct impact on the
host economy, such as that related to tax avoidance, from pass-through capital that does have a direct
impact on the host economy, such as from reducing transactions costs, will also be explored. Finally, it
would be useful to use additional information from the balance sheets included in Orbis to develop
some estimates of the total assets controlled by the foreign investor in the host economies.
Nevertheless, the estimates in this paper will continue to rely on the availability of detailed micro-data
that includes ownership information. It would obviously be preferable for the estimated to be based on
data collected for the production of official FDI statistics. As a first step, countries could publish a
limited set of data based on the nationality of the ultimate investor; that is, identifying the outward
investment positions of a country accounted for by direct investors in the reporting country that are in
fact foreign-owned. Ultimately, it would be useful to have countries attempt to use these methods. This
could identify additional complexities in the financial structure of MNEs that need to be addressed as
well as giving an indication of the feasibility of these methods.

Data Annex
To produce the estimates of pass-through capital, two datasets were used: micro-level data from Bureau
van Dijk's Orbis database and aggregate FDI positions from the OECD FDI Statistics Database.

A. Micro data
The source database for this analysis is Orbis by Bureau Van Dijk. This is a cross-country firm level
database containing ownership link information connecting subsidiaries through their direct owners to
their ultimate (global) owners. These data are sourced from a variety of documents (company reports
and accounts, stock exchange filings, and regulatory records) and includes ownership percentages, types
of relationships (such as global or domestic ultimate owner) and dates related to each relationship.
The dataset was created by pooling cross sections of linkages for years 2007 to 2015. For each linkage,
the variables examined were:
•
•
•
•

Subsidiary identifier and country 15;
Shareholder identifier and country 16;
Global Ultimate Owner (ownership above 50%) and country 17; and
Percentages of ownership (direct and total).

To be included in each cross section, the linkages had to be active in the year and entities at shareholder
level (hence, the country of pass-through) were limited to be European Union and EEA countries. This
was done to ensure maximum quality and timeliness of data (the higher European coverage is a wellknown feature of Orbis). Subsidiaries and Ultimate Owners were however unconstrained in terms of
geographic location. The cases in which the entire ownership chain was located in the same country
were removed.
Subsequently foreign-owned investors and their affiliates were identified. These are the instances of
pass-through linkages. Foreign-owned investors were found using the ‘GUO50’ variable. Orbis
identifies the GUO by following the ownership chain of the enterprise through control relationships
until an entity that is not controlled by another entity is reached.
In addition, to focus on pass-through capital through operating affiliates rather than SPEs, enterprises
with NACE codes 6420 and 6430 were dropped from the sample. This was a rough definition of SPE 18
because it only considered the industry code and not other factors, such as the amount of employment
or share of foreign assets or liabilities on their balance sheets. Financial accounts data on shareholder
funds and income were then added to the database via the respective identifiers. Preference was given
for subsidiaries to the unconsolidated financial statements. For the shareholders and the GUOs, priority
was given to unconsolidated accounts, but where the shareholder’ funds variable was not available,
consolidated data were retained.

15

Country was based on the two-letter ISO code prefix contained in the entity identifier. This reflects the
country of registration of the firm.

For further details, please consider, for example, the Eurostat NACE Rev.2 Introductory guidelines. Units
classified in these two classes do not have any revenue from the sale of products, and usually do not employ staff
(except possibly one or a few persons acting as legal representatives). Sometimes these units are called "brass
plates", or "post boxes" or "empty boxes", or "special purpose entities - SPE", as they just have a name and an
address.

A.1. Treatment of outliers and missing values
Each cross section of data was scrutinised in order to prevent individual outliers from driving passthrough estimates. Maxima and minima by country and year were removed; in addition, data points
ranked second within country-year distributions, where the ratio of the data point to the maximum or
minimum exceeded 75%, were also dropped.
In cases where the total ownership percentage—both direct and indirect—were missing, the direct
ownership percentage was used. This means that the estimates are likely a lower bound on the amount
of pass-through capital.

A.2. Coverage of FDI statistics
Orbis outward equity stock by country of immediate investor was compared to official FDI equity
positions (excluding SPEs) to assess the coverage of the sample (table A.1).

This comparison is rough as differences in valuation can result in significant asymmetries in FDI
statistics (Angulo and Hierro, 2017), and there is no way to determine how the valuations of total equity
in Orbis compare to the valuations in the source data countries use in compiling their FDI statistics. As
a result, this comparison should be taken only as indicative of the coverage the Orbis data provide. The
coverage varies across countries and over time. There is a general trend upward in coverage, reflecting
the improved country coverage in Orbis in terms of both the number of countries covered and the
coverage within countries. Because the European region is generally better covered in Orbis, countries
with a higher share of outward investment in Europe would be expected to have higher coverage than
other countries. The figures for Luxembourg likely exceed the total outward investment because the
procedure for removing SPEs from Orbis did not capture all of the entities identified as SPEs by
Luxembourg. The negative value for the Czech Republic in 2011 reflected a large negative value for
equity in a subsidiary that was subsequently dropped in treating the data for outliers.

A3. Computation of pass through capital
The computation of pass-through capital was done in two steps:
1) Once all of the enterprises with foreign subsidiaries were identified, their ownership percentage in
their foreign subsidiaries was multiplied by the shareholders’ funds to estimate the equity claim the
direct investors had on the subsidiaries. Then, equity claims tied to the same enterprise group were
aggregated at the shareholder level.
2) The different options for the direction of pass-through (or zero-pass-through) were evaluated as
outlined in 2.1.1 Data were summed by direct investor country, and the share of pass-through was than
calculated by taking the ratio of pass-through equity over total outward equity positions by country.

B. FDI positions
A time series of inward and outward FDI positions from 2007 to 2015 was constructed from the OECD
FDI statistics database. Statistics excluding resident SPEs were used when available. For countries that
did not separately identify the FDI to and from resident SPEs in earlier years, the share of resident SPEs
in the total positions for the first year the data were reported was carried back to 2007. No other
adjustments were made for the implementation of BD4 so there might be other breaks in series.
The United Kingdom reports SPEs for detailed annual statistics but not for the aggregate statistics,
resulting in differences in vintage that make it difficult to construct a time series.

C. Additional descriptive statistics for Ultimate Investing Country
The table below provides information on all countries identified as UIC’s of pass-through entities and
their respective shares of the equity and number of entities they account for in 2007 and 2015.
