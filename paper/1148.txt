Consumer Durables and the Real Interest Rate

Abstract

One important channel through which real interest rates
affect aggregate demand is consumer expenditure on durable

goods. This paper examines empirically the link between
interest rates and consumer durables. Solving for the decision
rule relating income and interest rates to consumer demand is
an

intractable task. This paper avoids this problem by

examining the first—order conditions necessary for maximization
by the representative consumer. Structural parameters of the

representative

utility function are thus recovered. The

estimated model suggests that expenditure on consumer durables
is far more sensitive to changes in the interest rate than is
expenditure on nondurables and services.

I. Introduction

Restrictive monetary policy reduces aggregate demand

by

raising the real interest rate. Government spending crQwds
out private spending also by raising the interest rate; the
more interest sensitive is private demand, the greater is the

crowding OUt, and the lower is the multiplier. Consumer
expenditure

on

durable goods is one important chaxinel of

effects. The purpose of this paper is to examine
empirically the linkage between interest rates' and consumer
these

durables.
There

has been relatively little recent work, on con—

suiner durables. The studies that do exist largely ignore the
effects of interest rates. In my 182 paper, I examine the
implications of the permanent income hypothesis for dura.ble
goods.

Although the theory

assumes

a constant real interest rate. Bernank&s

is

soundly

rejected, the test
(1982)

recent paper emphasizes the role of adjustment costs. Ee too
rejects the permanent income hypothesis, yet he cannot solve
his model allowing for a variable and uncertain real rate of
return. The rejections reported in these papers are possibly
due to unwarranted assumptions regarding the

real interest

Indeed, expenditure on durables is often thought to
be very interest sensitive. The model presente.d and estimated
in this paper directly measures the interest sensitivity of
rate.

consumer expenditure both on durables and on nondurables and
services.

Lucas (1976), in his now famous critique of econometric
policy evaluation, cogently criticizes the use of a standard

reduced form consumption function. A new approach, which began
with Hall (1978), has evolved in an attempt to estimate structural parameters while avoiding the problems Lucas points out.
Instead of estimating the decision rule relating income and
interest rates to consumer demand, only the first-order conditions

necessary for an optimum are examined. Grossman and Shiller
(1981), Hall (1982) , Hanson and Singleton (1983) , Mankiw (1981)

Runkle (1982), Shapiro (1983), Shiller (1982) and Summers (1982)
all use this approach to study consumption and asset returns
in the case of nondurable goods. In my 1982 paper with Roteniberg
and Summers, we examine the intertemporal substitution in both

consumption and labor supply. All these studies ignore durable
goods. This paper therefore extends this new methodology to
model the demand for consumer durables.
The estimated model suggests that expenditure on durables
is far more sensitive to changes in the interest rate than is

expenditure on nondurables and services. In particular, a
temporary one percentage point increase in the real interest
rate reduces the stock of durables by 3.4 percent, while it
reduces the expenditure on nondurables and services by only .5

percent. Since the stock of durables is four times the annual
flow,, this one percentage point higher interest rate reduces

annual expenditure on durables by 13.6 percent.

the estimation procedure and the use of the estimated parameters.

results. Section VI is a brief conclusion.

II.

The Model
I assume that aggregate consumption behavior can be modeled

as the optimizing decisions of a representative consumer. The
consumer maximizes the following utility function..

C = consumption of nondurable goods;
K = stock of th2rable goods providing services to the
consumer;
U = one—period utility from the nondurable
goods;
V

= one—period

utility from the durable goods.

Various assumptions are implicit in this utility f'unction. First,
the objective function is additively separable through time.
Although it has no theoretical basis, most previous work maintains this assumption, primarily since it facilitates the
generation of empirically testable hypotheses. Second, non—
durables and durables are additively separable in the

utility

function. In addition, by ignoring, the utility of leisure, I
implicitly assume that leisure and consumption are additively

separable. The main virtue of these postulates, which are
also maintained in most previous work, is again parsimony. In
my 1982 paper with Rotexnberg and Summers, we allow' non—separability

between consumption and leisure. In that paper, no qualitative conclusions are altered, and no additional insights are gained, by relaxing

5.

this separability assumption. Throughout this study, I maintain
the assumption of additive separability both through time and

among nondurable consumption, durable consumption, and leisure.
I

assume the

consumer has access to some capital market.

That is, he is not liquidity constrained. Let t the nominal

expenditure on nondurables and durabIes at this relative price.
Solving for the consl..unerts decision rule is an almost

intractible task. The current levels of C and

depend upon

the entire subjective distribution of all futire interest rates,

prices and incomes. Lucas (l976 correctly criticizes the derivation
and use of standard consumption functions. These consumption
functions insufficiently treat the formation of expectations.

The estimated parameters are not invariant with respect to policy

changes, and meaningful interpretation of the econometric

results is difficult. This paper avoids thIs problem by
examining the first—order conditions for an optimum, rather
than the reduced form decision rule.
I examine two first—order conditions necessary for maximation

of the utility function (1). Their derivation rests upon simple

perturbation arguments. In particular, no feasible perturbation
from an optimum should increase expected utility. The first—order
effect of a small feasible perturbation is

No study has examined condition (6). This equation allows us
to examine the link between interest rates and consumption of
both nondurables and durables.
The first—order condition (6) is based upon the somewhat
unnatural comparison between the current stock of dura.bles and
next period's consumption of nondurables.

Indeed, that the

perturbation is so unnatural may explain why previous work on
durables has typically not allowed a stochastic real interest

rate. There are, of course, other more natural perturbations
to consider. Yet these often produce first—order conditions with

(6) are not "consumption. functions", as they do not relate
endogenous decision variables to exogenous forcing variables.
As the next section shows, these relations do allow' us to estimate
the utility function parameters from, observed levels oe consumption, and thus permit inferences regarding consumer behavior.
These first-order conditions are fully robust to assumptions
regarding other markets. In particular, no assumption is
necessary regarding the income process or the determination
of employment. The labor market can clear continuously, as in
neoclassical macromodels, or it can exhibit persistent dis-equilibrium,
and

as in Keynesian macromodels. In either case, conditions C3) and
(.6) hold so long as the representative consumer can trade off

expenditure today and expenditure tomorrow.

These linearized first—order conditions are somewhat more tractibie
and intuitive that (.3') and (6'), the equivalent nonlinear versions.

It is useful to examine the linearized first-order conditions
(3") and (6") in the special case that the relative price terms,

R1 and R2, are constant. Ignoring the constant term, (3") implies

that the growth rate of consumption, log(C÷1/C) is white noise,

since Et(u+i) = 0.

The level of consumption, log(C÷1) is thus

a random walk. In addition, no information known at time t, apart
from log(.C) should be useful in forecasting log (.Ct+i). Equivalent-

ly, the optimal forecast of log(C1) is log(C). In an important
paper, Hall (.1978) first shows these results. Equation (.3") is a

generalization of Hall's "random walk" theorem.

Data
To estimate the model, I use U. S. data from 1950 to 1981.

Instead of using quarterly data, as in HaJ,l (1978) and Mankiw (1981),

or monthly data, as in Hanson and Singleton (1983), T use data

only from the fourth quarter of each year. This procedure, which
Hall (1982) also follows, has five justifications.

First, the BEA publishes data on the stock of durables only

for the end of each calendar year. It is possible to construct
a quarterly stock series from the flow data. Bernanke (1982)

follows this procedure. Nonetheless, there are clear advantages
to using a standard published series.

Second, the use of data at an annual frequency minimizes

problem of seasonal adjustment. Undoubtedly, tastes for
haatin.g oil, for instance,
consumption are seasonal. The demand for
is greater in winter than in suituter. Similarly', techo1ogy makes
the

certain prices seasonal. Ceitain fruits' and yeeta1es

are

obvious examples. Ieal1y, as Niron C19821 discusses', one shou1d
encorporate this sea.sonality into the model. In pra,ctice this
often complicates modelling substantially. The standard procedure
of using X—11 adjusted data bas' no theoritical jtis'tiicatiOn.
This paper avoids the problem of seasonality by the use of only
fourth quarter data.

17.

Third,
use

of only fourth quarter data. The

and K

conditi.ons (3)

at points in time. Observed consumption

measured as an average over an interval. A time average of

a stochastic process can. have properties very different than the

process itself. For example, as Working C1960) shows, the time
average of a random walk has serially correlated increments.

Thus, the use of contiguous time averages is often not the

best way to study the underlying stochastic process. By examining
data only from the fourth quarter of each year, the problem of
time averaging is greatly reduced.

Fourth, over short intervals, goods labelled nondurable

are in fact durable. For example, a pair of shoes, which is
classified nondurable in the National Income Accounts, typically

lasts longer than three months. Those items called nondurable
simply have relatively higher depreciation rates. It is more
plausible to believe that shoes fully depreciate over a year
than over a month or aquarter. This suggests the use of an annual
rather than a quarterly periodicity.

18.

The fifth and final justification for the use of only
fourth quarter data is based upon the possible illiquidity
of consumer durables and upon the costs of adjusting the stock.

Mishkin (1976) emphasizes the importance of the illiquidity

of consumer durables. Undoubtedly, the resale market for
durables is imperfect, largely de to the "Lemonst' problem

Akerloff (1970) describes. Similarly, Bernanke (1982) stresses
the costs of adjusting the stock of durables. Few individuals
buy a new car, for example, without time—consuming search and

deliberation. This process often delays the actual purchase.
These considerations suggest that the stock of durables does not

adjust instantly to the desired stock. Nonetheless, over longer
periods, the adjustment process is less important. Thus, the
model above is likely a better approximation for annual data than
for more frequent data.

The variable C is per capita expenditure on nondurables and
services in fourth quarter as reported in the National Income and

Product Accounts. The variable K is the per capita net stock of
durables at the end of the year. The Bureau of Economic Analysis
computes this series. Musgrave (1979) discusses the BEA method—

ology. The depreciation rate(5) I use is 0.2, which is consistent
with the BEA net stock and flow series.
The interest rate is the three month Treasury bill rate.

The rate i is the return from buying a three month T-bill in the
fourth quarter and reinvesting in T-bills each quarter until the

next fourth quarter. I use a const3nt marginal tax rate(t) of 0.3.

and pC are the NIPA deflators for durables

and for nondurables and services, respectively, in the fourth

21.

Table 1 presents estimates of equation (3").

The estimates

indicate the utility function parameter 1/a is approximately
.37 with a standard error of .33.

Equivalently, a is roughly

2.7 with a standard error of 2.4. In my 1981 paper, I report
an estimate of a of 4. Other studies that examine (3) report
a broad range of estimates. Hall (1982) reports that a is about
15, while in my 1982 paper with Rotemberg and Summers, we find

a well less than one. All the studies report estimates of the
theoretically correct sign, which certainly lends support to the
model.
The coefficient on disposable income growth is insignificant

in (3"). The coefficient is roughly 20 percent lower than the
one I report in my 1981 paper and the standard error is larger.
It is possible that the inability to reject here is due to the
smaller sample size, as the 1981 paper uses quarterly data. On
the other hand, the earlier results may be attributable to the

use of contiguous time averages. It is difficult to disentangle

the various explanations. Yet it appears reasonable to conclude
that the model, although likely not exact, provides a good
approximation of consumer behavior.

Table 2 presents estimates of equation (6"), the first—
order condition relating the current stocks of consumer durables,
future consumption of nondurables and services, and the relative

price. The estimate of 1/a is approximately 1/3. This is
almost exactly the same as the estimate from equation (3"), a

fact that provides strong support for the model. The estimate
of

is

roughly 2/3 and has a small standard error. The

data suggest that ci. is about 3, and $ is about 2.

Disposable income growth is again insignificant in (6"),

conforming to the theory. On the other hand, the Durbin-Watson
statistic is very low, indicating positive serial correlation.

This contradicts the theory, since E[u1l = o implies u1
is serially uncorrelated if u is known at time t. There are
various plausible explanations for this serial correlation.
First, the process of adjustment discussed in the last section

may lead to this serial correlation. Bernanke's (1982) model
suggests it would. Although the use of an annual periodicity
may reduce the problem, undoubtedly the adjustment process is

not complete each fourth quarter. This is certainly the case
when news arrives late in the year. Second, it is possible
that tastes for durables relative to nondurables changes
throughout the period. This explanation. suggests the utility
function parameter 0, which is inthedded in the constant term

in (6"), is a serially correlated random variable. Third, it
is likely that quality changes in durables or nondurables are
perceived imperfectly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The

mistakes in measuring Kt or C undoubtedly persist through time,
and thus lead to serially correlated errors in (.6"). Fourth,
it is likely that simple division by the population does not
adequately account for demographic changes.

Individuals at

23.

different stages in life have different consumption patterns.
Gradual changes in the age profile

of the population, as well

as other demographic movements, could explain the serially

correlated error. All these explanations suggest that, despite
the serial correlation, the model is a useful framework for
examining the linkage between interest rates, prices and consumer
demand.

Table 3 presents estimates of ci. and 8 from alternative

forms of

the first-order conditions (3")

and (6"). In each

the previous estimated equations, the relative price variable
R is placed on the right hand side of the equation. Although
this normalization may be more natural, it is also econometrically
correct to rewrite (3") and (6") with log(R) as the left hand side
of

variable. Both normalizations produce consistent estimates
under the null hypothesis that the model is correct. In a.

finite sample, the estimates may be different. For the SHORT
instrument list, the normalization is irrelevant, since the

equation is exactly identified. A comparison of column 3.1 with
column 1.1, and column 3.3 with. column 2.1, verifies this fact.

As is shown in columns 3.2 and 3.4, the estimates using the
LONG instrument list do change with this alternative normalization.
Yet. the signs of a and 8 are still correct. In addition,

although the alternative estimates are smaller, they are not greatly
different when compared to the standard errors.

The l.as column in Table 3 presents estimates from a hybrid

of (3") and (6"). If we solve these two equations to eliminate
2
1
1og(C÷1) we obtain a relation between 1og(R÷1/R1)1
log(C)

and log(K). We can estimate this relation with ordinary least
squares, since log(C) and. 1og(K) are known at time t and
hence uncorrelated with the error term. The estimates of .

and

from this equation again have the correct sign, lending

further support to the model, although they are also smaller
than those presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 4 presents various elasticities for
=

=

1.5 and

1, which appear reasonable parameter estimates. Also pre-

sented are the elasticities for other plausible parameter values.
The short-run interest semi-elasticities are particularly
striking. A one percentage point rise in the interest rate
reduces consumption of nondurables and services by .5 percent.

It reduces the stock of durables by 3.4 percent. Since the
stock of consumer durables is roughly four times the annual
flow, a one percentage point rise in the real interest rate
reduces annual expenditure on durables by about 13.6 percent.

V. Conclusion
This paper examines the linkage between interest rates and
consumption both of durables and of nondurables and services.
The model presented here accords well with U.S. postwar data.
The estimated coefficients have the correct sign, and are well

within the range ofestimates from previous studies. In
addition, when the same structural parameter is estimated in

different equations, the two estimates are very close. These
findings suggest that the model is a good first approximation
of consumer behavior.

The estimates indicate that consumer expenditure on
durables is very responsive to changes in the real interest

rate. This finding is consistent with casual observation. For
example, it is widely believed that high real interest rates

caused the recent recession. Between 1979 and 1982, inflation
fell from 11.7 percent to 4.1 percent. At the same time, the
three month Treasury bill rate rose from 10.0 percent to 10.7

percent. Consumer spending during this recession was strong,

probably because of the large personal tax cuts. Consumption
of nondurables and services rose by 4.9 percent during these

three years. Expenditure on durables, though, fell by 5.8

percent. This pattern is precisely what one would expect from

26.

the policy mix. Personal tax cuts bolstered consumers'
expectations as to their permanent income. But restrictive
monetary policy lead to high real interest rates, which
increased the relative price of holding durables relative to

consuming nondurables and services. It is not surprising that
the auto industry suffered particularly high.unemployment
during this economic downturn.

Although the model explains the data well, there are

various generalizations future research should pursue. The
strongest restriction imposed in this paper is the form of the

utility function. The various additive separability
assumptions could be relaxed. In particular, future work
should pay closer attention to the role of adjustment costs. A
model that took account of the adjustment process would be
better suited for examining the effects of shorter term

fluctuations in the real interest rate. The model presented
here provides only a first step for understanding the
connection between interest rates and consumer expenditure.
