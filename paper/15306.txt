Nature of Oil Price Shocks and Monetary Policy

NBER Working Paper No. 15306
September 2009
JEL No. E32,E52,E58
ABSTRACT
We investigate the nature of oil price shocks to the Korean economy in recent years and find that the
recent hike in oil price is induced by the increase in oil demand in contrast to the previous years when
oil price run-up is mostly from supply disruptions. We also study how monetary responses to oil price
shocks affect economic stability and find that an accommodative policy yields more stable outcomes.

Introduction

Since the second oil crisis in 1979-1980, oil price has shown a stable trend. After the short
period of price drop in 2001, oil price turned its course and increased steadily and substantially since 2002 and reached the record high in the summer of 2008. Figure 1 displays the
evolution of the WTI(Western Texas Intermediate) oil price in U.S. dollars since 1970 and
the Korean recession periods. This figure illustrates several episodes of oil price hikes including 1973-1974, 1979-1980, 1990, and recent price run-ups. Glancing over the figure, one can
find many recession periods overlap with the oil price hikes.
Unlike the 1980s and 90s when there were many literature with ideas associating oil prices
with economic recessions, the recent episode of the price run-up has been rather subdued as
the oil price has not brought a sharp economic downturn unlike previous episodes until lately.
Even though the price of oil has started to stabilize since the autumn of 2008 and we are no
longer faced with sky-high oil prices, another round of fluctuations in oil price sparked debates
from both academics and policymakers not only because it exhibited a record-breaking price
level, but also macroeconomic impacts of oil shocks were different from the experiences in
the 1970s as well as the origin of the recent shock.

The increase in oil price will affect the GDP growth adversely both in consumption and
production channels.1 In consumption channel, oil price hikes will reduce disposable income
as consumers pay more money to operate their vehicles and to heat their homes. The effects
of the rise in oil price will be larger when the demand for oil consumption is less elastic.
1

Further discussion can be found in Kilian(2008).

Consumers might postpone their consumption as their disposable income is reduced, hence,
the economic activities will be sluggish. Also, increase in oil prices may add uncertainty in the
future economic outlook, and consumer may save more as a precautionary measure, hence it
will adversely affect the economy. In addition to this, Hamilton(2005) stressed the indirect
effect arising when patterns of consumption expenditure change. The shifts in expenditure
patterns will disturb sectoral allocation of resources and result in cutbacks in consumption
as well as increase in unemployment in the presence of friction in both labor and capital
markets.
Production may decline as the GDP growth rate becomes lower when production costs are
raised and secondly, large oil price changes may increase uncertainty in business investment,
hence, inducing lower aggregate output. The extent to which oil price increases translated
into overall rise in inflation depends on their persistence and the share of energy prices in
inflation measures.(Rotemberg and Woodford 1996)
Historically, most of the previous oil price shocks arose due to supply contractions from
wars and geopolitical uncertainty tied in with oil-exporting countries. Hamilton(1996) showed
that most of the U.S. recessions were preceded by increases in oil prices and expounded the
increase in oil prices is the main cause of recessions. Guo and Kliesen(2005) found that
oil price volatility has had a significant adverse effect on fixed investment, consumption,
employment and the unemployment rate using NYMEX crude oil futures data.2 However,
the latest rise in oil prices is understood to be have stemmed from strong market demands
and should be treated as endogenous.3 As economic powerhouses, China and India have
become huge consumers of crude oil and the demands from other Asian countries have
also increased as their economy recovered from the financial crisis of the late 1990s. Also,
developed countries have decreased their interest rates in this period, which accounts for
asset price bubbles and increase in commodity prices throughout this period. Some argue
that the advancement of financial derivatives turned into speculative boom, contributing to
the sky-high rise in energy prices. However, there appears no consensus on how much of
the price increases are contributed by speculative forces and fundamental movements. Other
conspicuous feature is that recent oil price hikes resulted in divergence between headline
and core inflation rates which exclude volatile energy and food prices. The recent oil price
2

Barsky and Kilian(2004) and Kilian(2008) refused the idea of exogeneity of oil shocks to the U.S. economy.
They argue that precautionary demand shocks driven by expectation shifts may have a major impact on the
U.S. economy. They added this type of shocks were associated with the geopolitical events in the Middle
East, hence, caused misinterpretation of the source of the shocks.
3
Kilian(2007) provide evidence that unanticipated crude oil supply shocks are far less important than
shocks from the demand for crude oil.

increases seem to slowly pass the impact to the price of non-energy goods and services and
led to dissociation between the headline and core inflation. This widening gap between two
measures of inflation re-ignites debates over which inflation measure the central bank should
focus has been resurfaced.4
The goal of this paper is to analyze the nature of recent oil price hikes and their effects on
the Korean macroeconomic activities. The Korean economy has experienced quite different
responses of output and prices to oil price inflation compared to the two previous oil shocks.
Early part of this paper will be devoted to investigate the changing patterns of the responses.
Also, we will discuss whether monetary policy to oil price change has been operated optimally
to stabilize the macroeconomy. For this purpose, we build a DSGE model with a Taylor type
monetary policy where monetary policy responds differentially to oil and non-oil prices. This
can be interpreted that monetary policy reacts to overall CPI inflation per se. However, the
magnitude of intervention is different based on the types of price, i.e. core or non-core price.
Earlier literature on which measures of inflation the central bank should focus on to
oil shocks tends to side with core inflation rather than headline inflation. The oft-quoted
reasoning for this is that headline inflations are inherently noisy as they include volatile items
like food and energy, and they do not reflect changes in the underlying rate of inflation. Also,
monetary policy targeting headline inflation could lead to aggravate economic activity when
oil shocks are transitory. Suppose that a central bank tightens its policy stance in reaction to
the rise of energy prices. Monetary policy action is typically believed to have at least 6-month
lag before coming into effect. However, around that time, the energy prices will eventually
go back to its original path as the shock is temporary and the outcome of such monetary
policy will result in decline in both unemployment and inflation which is undesirable in view
of the stabilizing role of monetary policy.
Goodfriend and King(1997) suggest that the monetary policy should focus on the sticky
component of prices rather than overall components, suggesting core inflation is the major
price index that the central bank should be concerned with. Aoki(2001) formalize a model
with two price sectors, one sticky and the other flexible, and support the view of Goodfriend
and King. Blinder and Reis(2005) provide evidence that core inflation predicts future headline inflation better than headline inflation itself.5 Erceg and Bodenstein(2008) argue that
core inflation targeting in response to adverse energy supply shocks has better stabilization
4

Countries differ in their choice of inflation measures. For example, Bank of England as well as Bank of
Korea sets headline inflation as its policy target, while the U.S. Federal Reserve put more emphasis on core
inflation in its policy operation.
5
Cogley(2002) and Rich and Steindel(2007) also found significant reversion of headline inflation to core
inflation.

property for both the operational conduct of central banks compared to headline inflation
targeting under sticky wage and price settings.
On the other hand, Harris et al.(2009) criticize the policy recommendations from standard
new Keynesian models in that those models assumed the complete anchoring of inflation
expectations. They showed the longer-term consumer expectations on inflation respond to
oil shocks and allude that the Fed should have put more weight on the increase in headline
inflation.6 Describing three statistical characteristics of oil shocks from historical data: (1)
permanent, (2) difficult to predict, and (3) governed by very different regimes at different
points in time, Hamilton(2008) contends that the oil price shocks cannot be treated as merely
transitory and the central bank should pay more attention to the development of headline
inflation which includes energy and food prices.7
We are not going to favor one from the other in this paper. The main findings in this
paper is that the recent oil shocks are triggered by demand sides in contrast to the previous
oil shocks and the monetary policy that will best stabilize output and inflation volatilities is
to accommodate oil price inflation when the stickiness of oil price is mild. In an estimated
DSGE model, oil prices are relatively flexible compared to wages and non-oil prices and the
monetary policy should be operated to accommodate oil price inflation, which is implemented
by the central bank of Korea. Combining those findings, we argue that both the nature of
the oil price inflation and the appropriate monetary policy are conducive to stabilizing the
Korean macroeconomy.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes basic findings from data. A
5-variable structural VAR model is constructed and analyzed in Section 3. Section 4 presents
a DSGE model with oil sector and estimation results. Section 5 investigates the shape of
optimal monetary policy depending on the stickiness of oil prices. Concluding remarks are
provided in Section 6.

Janet Yellen(2009) criticized Harris et al.(2009)’s view of unanchored inflation expectations that the
expected inflation in 2008 was only about 10 basis points higher than what it would have been in the
absence of the increase in oil price over this period.
7
Although agreeing to the idea that the Fed should focus on core inflation, Mishkin(2007) discussed two
reasons that a central bank should also watch over the headline inflation when the price of an excluded
item receives a permanent shock and the headline inflation deviated from the core measure for an extended
period of time. First, a longer period of high headline inflation increases the risk of inflation expectations
unanchored. Second, prolonged divergence between core and headline measures of inflation could hamper
communications between a central bank and the public. He described that the recent rise in oil prices seemed
to be more persistent compared to past experiences and the headline inflation has deviated from the core
inflation by a considerable margin during 2004-2006 periods.

Data

Quarterly data on the real GDP, CPI, export and oil prices(represented by the WTI) are
examined in this section. In order to evaluate how the oil prices and macroeconomic activities
differ before and after the crisis, we divide the data set before and after the currency crisis
of 1997. The dividing year is between in 1998-1999 when the Korean economy experienced a
structural break. A variety of evidence supports that the Korean economy has experienced
important and long-term changes during this periods, Oh(2007), and Kim and Kang(2004)
among others. Korea has introduced a free floating exchange rate system and the central bank
has applied inflation targeting, departing from the previous monetary aggregate targeting in
1998. Also, a wide range of restructuring in the corporate and financial sectors have changed
the landscape of those industries in these years.
For these reasons, empirical tests are based on two subperiods which are 1987:I-1997:IV
(pre-crisis sample) 8 and 2000:I-2009:I (post-crisis sample), omitting 1998 and 1999. Table
2 shows selected summary statistics for log-differenced data in those two subperiods and
the existence of unit roots is investigated in Table 2. Despite the increase in the standard
deviation of oil prices in the post-1998 sample, those of headline inflation, core inflation, and
real interest rate have substantially reduced in the same period compared to the pre-1998
sample. One interesting finding from the unit root test is that CPI rejects unit root in the
post-crisis sample in all test statistics. This is consistent with low inflation of recent years
in Figure 2 where the cumulative inflation processes show a pronounced difference from the
earlier years.
To observe how the dynamic impact of oil shocks on the macroeconomy has changed, we

years and the oil shock datings coincide with those selected in Blanchard and Gali(2007) in
Figure 2.9
The right hand side of the figure indicates the cumulative real GDP growths in each oil
shock periods. We observe that adverse effects of oil prices on the real GDP growth are most
conspicuous in the second oil shock period which is during 1979:I-1983.I. In the same period,
the economic activities have been shrank almost two years before bouncing back to its growth
trend. Compared to the earlier oil shocks, the recent episode brought a different picture and
the real GDP growth seems to be little affected for at least one year when oil price started
to climb up. Later on, the real GDP growth has declined a bit but the contraction effects

Blanchard and Gali(2007) identify 4 epidodes of oil shocks when the cumulative changes in (log) oil
prices are above 50 per cent. We discard the 3rd episode(1999:I-2000.IV) as the periods are close to the 4th
one(2002.I-2005.III), and those two episodes are back to back under our 4-year window convention.

The left hand side of the figure illustrates the cumulative CPI inflation of the same
periods. The cumulative price increases in the first and second oil shock periods are similar.
In both periods, the CPI inflation have increased around 70% in 4 years. However, the
recent oil price hike haven’t passed through its impact to the CPI price. The CPI inflation
has reached only 12% in 4 years, i.e. 3% increase of the CPI per annum, indicating the
macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks have changed in recent years.
In order to contrast the pre- and post-crisis macroeconomic responses to oil price shocks,
nonparametric estimation results of real GDP and CPI inflation to oil prices are presented in
Figure 3.10 The two graphs in the left column is the response of real GDP and CPI inflation
in the pre-crisis sample and the two graphs in the right column is those in the post-crisis
sample. In the pre-crisis period, real GDP growth and oil price are negatively related. CPI
inflation, however, is less clear on its functional form to the oil price changes. In the post-crisis
period, real GDP growth are almost flat to oil price changes and one cannot find any clear
functional relations between real GDP and oil prices unlike the previous sample. Turning to
the overall price, increases in oil prices do not bring forth the rise in CPI inflation, indicating
oil prices are not conducive to the rise in CPI inflation until recently.
Summing up, basic facts found from data point out that the nature of oil price shocks
or macroeconomic responses to such shocks have been changed in a way that the economy
accommodates them better compared to the previous years. The following section will discuss
the possible explanations in light of Korean circumstances.

Dynamic Effects of Oil Price Shocks
A Structural VAR Model

In this section, we will use a 5-variable VAR model as our workhorse to quantify the response
of real GDP and inflation to oil price shocks. These results will be used in assessing how
macroeconomic transmission mechanism of oil price have changed before and after the 19981999 period. Even though the 5-variable VAR methodology has many limitations to evaluate
the effect of oil price shock fully, adding more macroeconomic variables require additional

In estimation, we use a Gaussian kernel regression with optimal bandwidth suggested by Bowman and
Azzalini(1997).

identifying assumptions that may not be realistic and likely to be less precise in estimation.
In our VAR model, we assume there exist 5 types of structural shocks that affect the Korean
economy: oil shock, export shock, local aggregate supply shock, local aggregate demand
shock and monetary policy shock. Since, these structural shocks cannot be observed directly,
we need to employ identifying restrictions to break down those shocks. Our identification
assumptions are based on both long-run and short-run restrictions, which will be discussed
shortly.
Let ∆zt = [∆PO,t , ∆Xt ∆Yt , ∆Pt , i − ∆Pt ]0 denotes the log difference of oil price, export, real
GDP, price index and real interest rate and we assume that ∆zt is a covariance stationary
vector process suggested by the statistics in Table 2. Each element of ∆zt is demeaned, hence
it has a zero mean. The structural VAR can be represented by the following formula:
A0 ∆zt = A1 ∆zt−1 + A2 ∆zt−2 + · · · + Ap ∆zt−p + ωt

8

(1)

where A0 is 5 × 5 matrix restricting contemporaneous relations of the included variables.
ωt = [ωtOS , ωtF D , ωtLS , ωtLD , ωtM P ]0 implies 5 × 1 column vector consisting of oil shock(OS),
foreign demand shock(FD), local supply shock(LS), and local demand shock(LD) respectively
and E[ωt ] = 0 and E[ωt ωt0 ] = I5×5 . Alternatively, the structural VAR can be expressed as
follows:
∆zt = B1 ∆zt−1 + B2 ∆zt−2 + · · · + Bp ∆zt−p + Cωt = B(L)∆zt−1 + Cωt

(2)

where Bj = A−1
0 Aj and B(L) = [Ai,j (L)], Ai,j (L) = ai,j + ai,j L + · · · + ai,j L , i, j = 1, 2, ..., 5.
C = A−1
0 . C, inverse of contemporaneous relations, is 4 × 4 matrix. If zt is stationary process,
the VAR system can be rewritten as a VMA(Vector Moving Average) system according to
Wold representation theorem:
∆zt = C(L)ωt
(3)

where C(L) = [Ci,j (L)] for i, j = 1, ..., 5. Once we have C(L), we can recover expressions for
the levels of the different variables in terms of current and lagged values of the structural
disturbances by a straightforward transformation. The reduced-form autoregressive representation of the aforementioned structural VAR is given by:
∆zt = B(L)∆zt−1 + ut

(4)

where B(L) = [Bi,j (L)] for i, j = 1, ..., 5 and E[ut ] = 0 and E[ut u0t ] = Ω. Then, the reducedform Wold moving average representation of ∆zt can be expressed as:
∆zt = D(L)ut

(5)

where D(L) = [Di,j (L)] = (I − B(L))−1 for i, j = 1, ...5, and D(L) is invertible. Thus, ut is
the vector of innovations in the elements of ∆zt . Comparing Eq.(2) and Eq.(4), the following
condition holds:
ut = Cωt
(6)
for some 5 × 5 full rank matrix C. Eq.(7) implies that:
C(L) = D(L)C

(7)

Premultipying both sides of eq.(4) by C −1 , we can obtain the structural representation of
∆zt and the structural disturbance vector ωt . The structural VAR can be identified to the
extent that we introduce sufficient restrictions to determine 25 elements of matrix C. Given

9

C, we can recover C(L) by postmultiplying D(L) as in eq.(7). As the reduced-form variancecovariance matrix has 15 elements, we need 10 restrictions to just-identify the system. For
that reason, we introduce 3 long-run neutrality restrictions combined with 7 short-run restrictions. Regarding to the long-run restrictions, we assume that the growth of oil price, expressed
in WTI, are not affected from the local shocks, implying C1,3 (1) = C1,4 (1) = C1,5 (1) = 0.
Translating these restrictions using the relation in eq.(7):
D1,1 (1)C1,3 + D1,2 (1)C2,3 + D1,3 (1)C3,3 + D1,4 (1)C4,3 + D1,5 (1)C5,3 = 0

(8)

D1,1 (1)C1,4 + D1,2 (1)C2,4 + D1,3 (1)C3,4 + D1,4 (1)C4,4 + D1,5 (1)C5,4 = 0

(9)

D1,1 (1)C1,5 + D1,2 (1)C2,5 + D1,3 (1)C3,5 + D1,4 (1)C4,5 + D1,5 (1)C5,5 = 0

(10)

The short-run restrictions are composed of two groups: one is to limit the contemporaneous
effect of shocks and the other is the contemporaneous effect of endogenous variables. Simply
put, we introduce the short-run restrictions for both the matrix C and the matrix A0 .
Restrictions on the matrix C, we impose absence of a contemporaneous effect of local shocks
on oil price, implying the following three direction constraints on C
C1,3 = 0

(11)

C1,4 = 0

(12)

C1,5 = 0

(13)

Finally, we impose linear restrictions on the relations between the contemporaneous variables
on A0 : (1) contemporaneous oil price does not affect export, (2) contemporaneous interest
rate does not affect real GDP, (3) contemporaneous oil price does not affect real interest rate,
and (4) contemporaneous export does not affect real interest rate. Given this specifications,
we have the following restrictions, respectively:
A0,(2,1) = 0

(14)

A0,(3,5) = 0

(15)

A0,(5,1) = 0

(16)

A0,(5,2) = 0

(17)

Given A−1
0 = C, these restrictions can be map into 4 non-linear constraints on the elements
of C.

Empirical Results

Figure 4 displays the cumulative impulse responses based on the estimates using the precrisis sample. Each column represents a one standard deviation of structural shocks and the
response of three economic variables to the shocks can be read in row-wise.
To begin with the first column, we show how the economy works when there is an increases
oil prices. A temporary rise in the oil price decreases both export and real GDP immediately.
Export declines as the increase in oil prices contracts the economic activities of foreign
countries and their import demand will also shrink consequently. The adverse oil price shock
tends to permanently lower the real GDP by 0.5%. This could be caused by higher marginal
costs from energy inputs or lower consumption as consumer’s disposable income is reduced
after paying higher energy expenses. The price measured by CPI lowers initially but climbs
steadily up. One standard deviation increase of the oil prices raise the CPI by 0.2% after 20
quarters. Real interest rate goes down due to the rise in inflation.
The second column is the response of macroeconomic variables to a one standard deviation of an export shock. An increase in export shock, presumably driven by foreign demand,
will raise domestic exports and real GDP will also rise. One standard deviation of an export
shock shock will raise exports and real GDP by 2.1% and 0.4%, respectively, permanently.
This shock has a limited impact on oil price. The price goes up until 7th quarter after the
shock and slowly dies out. Real interest rate decreases due to the increase in price growth in
the period of the shock but slowly crawls up and rises by 0.4% in the long run.
The third column is the response to a one-standard deviation of local AS shock. The local
AS shock increases domestic output and decreases price as the textbook model predicts.
The initial deflationary impact raises the real interest rate. Export decreases due to the
high interest rate. The decrease in export can be ascribed to the higher financing costs for
exporting sectors. With a favorable aggregate supply shocks, real interest rate rises as the
marginal productivity increases. This is largely consistent with a standard model.
The fourth column shows the response of the macro variables to a one-standard deviation
of local AD shock. The typical paths of real GDP and price move in the same directions,
which can be found in the figure. The real interest rate can move up or down depending on
the source of the AD shock. In our result, real interest rate decreases reflecting the lack of
variability in the nominal rate.
Finally, the fifth column provides the response to a monetary policy shock. The monetary
policy shock will lower the real GDP permanently. Inflation tends to rise in the period of

the shock reflecting, presumably, the increase in marginal costs. However, as the time lapses,
inflation will slowly decline and reduced by 0.5% in the long-run. The monetary policy
shock decrease export in the period of the shock but export increases over time. Increase in
real interest rate can divert resources from domestic consumption to export and this could
explain the export movement in respond to the monetary policy shock. However, its impacts
are statistically insignificant except the early period after the shock.
Until now, we have described how the Korean economy has absorbed 4 identified shocks
in the pre-crisis period. Out next task is to see whether the impact from the global supply
shock delivered by rises in oil prices has any different dynamics after the Korean economy
12

went through a structural change. Figure 5 illustrates the impulse response based on the
estimates from the post-crisis sample.
What stands out from this exercise is the impulse response of export to an oil price shock.
Export increases to the oil shock, unlike the previous case. Real GDP rises immediately after
the arrival of the oil price shock but it declines as the lapse of time and eventually dies
out.11 One would ascribe the different responses of real GDP and export to the different
exchange rate regimes in the pre- and post- crisis period. Since 1980, Korea has introduced
a multi-currency basket system and the exchange rate remained under the tight control of
the government until it is replaced by the market average exchange rate in 1991. Since the
adoption of the new exchange rate regime, market forces began to play an increasing role
in the determination of the exchange rate. However, daily fluctuations in the exchange rate
were tightly controlled and regarded close to a fixed rate system per se. After the outbreak
of the crisis, Korea has a free floating exchange rate system and market plays the most
crucial role in the valuation of the Korean Won. From this perspective, one can hypothesize
that increases in oil prices raise the exchange rate and spur exports. This argument can be
easily tested and the results are provided in Table 3.2. One might consider this argument
sounds plausible, but it turns out that this argument cannot be supported in the data. The
post-crisis coefficients of the oil price on the exchange rate is significantly negative ranging
from -0.171 to -0.226, whereas those of the pre-crisis are distributed between -0.004 to 0.008,
moreover statistically insignificant. The negative coefficients on the oil price observed in
the post-crisis sample cannot be compatible with the exchange rate-to-export hypothesis.
Hence, we need to seek somewhere else to explain the responses of export in the post-crisis
period and it will be discussed in due course. The oil price shock raises the price immediately
and 0.2% higher in the long run, reflecting increased flexibility in prices compared to the
pre-crisis period. The real interest rate increases at the oil price shocks in contrast to the
pre-crisis period where interest rate has decreased. We understand this fact is related to the
more active role of the Korean monetary authority to keep the inflation under control. As
noted earlier, the Korean central bank becomes more independent and is endowed with the
authority to set short-term interest rate since the crisis. The response of the monetary policy
to oil price hikes is the factor to observe the increase in real interest rate. These picture can
be understood as the dynamic effects of the oil price shock have changed and the interactions
between oil prices and domestic macroeconomic aggregates build different patterns in the
post-crisis period.12
11

Similar results are found in Hooker(1996) when he used 1973:IV-1994:II U.S. sample.
Blanchard and Gali(2007) found that the impulse response of the U.S GDP and CPI to oil price shocks
has changed considerably between the periods before and after 1983. They suggested that the U.S. economy

The impulse responses to an one-standard deviation of local AS shock are presented in
the third column in the figure. The shock raises real GDP as expected from the standard
model. Although inflation decreases at the inception of the shock, its long-run impact is
erratically 0.2% higher in the long run. But it is statistically insignificant and we should
not give much weight on this. Real interest rate increases due to the initial deflationary
pressure and increased productivity. The local AS shock in the post-crisis sample has a
more pronounced effect on export compared to that in the pre-crisis sample. Contrary to
the decrease to the local AS shock in the pre-crisis period, the growth of export is positive
in the period of the shock. Under the ceteris paribus circumstance, the local AS shock will
raise the comparative advantage of Korea which is conducive to positive export and GDP
growth. However, the increase in export growth will be slowed down as the exchange rate
will be adjusted to dilute the effect of comparative advantage. The fifth column shows the
impulse responses to monetary policy shocks. One interesting finding is that higher interest
rate will appreciate local currency resulting in decreased exports and real GDP. Increase in
real interest rate diverts domestic resources to exporting sectors in the pre-crisis period in
contrast to the post-crisis period when the exchange rate plays an increasingly important
role in the responses of exports.

3.3

Historical Simulation

In order to figure out the differences how the oil price shock affect the Korean economy, we
estimate dynamic correlations between real GDP and price in both periods. For that purpose,
we estimate historical disturbances from our estimated structural VAR and eliminate all the
shocks other than the oil price shocks. In the pre- and post- crisis period, oil price shocks
affects both output and price. If the correlations between real GDP and price are positive,
has faced an improved tradeoff in the post 1983 periods.

we can infer that the oil price shocks affect the aggregate demand of the economy as the shift
in demand schedule will move price and real GDP in the same direction. On the contrary,
negative correlations between real GDP and price imply the oil price shocks influence the
aggregate supply as the shift in supply schedule will drive both price and real GDP in
the opposite direction. The j−period ahead dynamic correlation at time t can be found as

15

follows:
Corr(∆Ŷt+j , ∆P̂t+j |Ωt ) =
=

(∆Ŷt+j − E[∆Ŷt+j |Ωt ])(∆P̂t+j − E[∆P̂t+j |Ωt ])
σ(∆Ŷt+j |Ωt )σ(∆P̂t+j |Ωt )
η∆Ŷt+j η∆P̂t+j
σ(∆Ŷt+j |Ωt )σ(∆P̂t+j |Ωt )

where η∆ξt,t+j is the j−period ahead forecasting error of ξ(= ∆Ŷt , ∆P̂t ) and Ωt is information
set up to time t. The hat on top of the variables indicates the variables are constructed to
be solely affected by the oil shocks.
The dynamic correlations in the pre- and post-crisis periods are presented in Figure 6.
From this exercise, we can evaluate the transmission of oil price shocks to the economy. In
the short run, the oil shock affects the demand schedule and real GDP and price move in the
same direction. However, comparing the magnitude of the short-run correlations, the postcrisis correlations is more than two-fold of the pre-crisis counterpart. The high correlation
between output growth and inflation in the post-crisis period implies that the AS schedule
is more steep in this period than the pre-crisis period. The difference in the nature of the
shock is more pronounced when one looks into the long-run correlations. In the post-crisis
period, long-run correlations between real GDP and price around 0.4 , indicating the oil
price shock affect the aggregate demand in this period. In contrast, the long-run correlations
become negative in the pre-crisis sample, implying oil price shocks influence the aggregate
supply in this period. These findings combined with the earlier impulse response analysis
lead to the following conclusion. The oil shocks in the pre-crisis period can be ascribed to oil
supply shocks. The oil price shocks caused by disruptions in oil supply will adversely affect
domestic production which renders the AS schedule move to the left resulting in the negative
correlation between output growth and inflation. In contrast, the oil prices shocks observed
in the post-crisis period are produced from the increase in oil demand. Oil price increase
generated by the increased world demand will raise exports and domestic output which can
be observed from the first column in Figure 5. Increase in world demand will shift the AD
schedule to the right resulting in positive correlations between output growth and inflation.
The oil price changes, especially upward movements, have brought many economic difficulties in the past. It’s still a problem but its macroeconomic impacts have been quite
subdued in recent periods, as shown in our VAR evidence. We argue the nature of the shock
has been changed in the recent oil price run-up. Unlike the previous year when most of the
oil shocks are believed to have been driven by supply disruptions, the recent oil price rise
stemmed from the increase in demand for oil. A demand-driven oil price hike keeps the Ko16

rean economy buoyant in contrast to the macroeconomic troubles experienced in the past
years.
So far, we have shown the macroeconomic impacts of the oil price change and put aside
the macroeconomic policies, especially monetary policy, which is essential in understanding
the propagation mechanism of external shocks. In the following section, we try to find out
whether monetary policy in the post-crisis years has been conducted in a way that can
stabilize macro-economy and the shape of optimal monetary policy in the face of oil price
shocks based on a simplified DSGE model

Nominal Rigidities with the Oil Sector
A Model

In this section, we construct a small open economy nominal rigidities model with oil and
non-oil sectors and extend closed economy one sector models with oil usage as in Bodenstein
17

et al. (2008).
We start with the production side of the non-oil sector. We denote the non-oil sector by
subscript n and the oil sector by subscript o in the following equations. Firms produce final
non-oil goods by aggregating intermediate goods. Namely,
Z

Production technology for the ith intermediate good is

where nn,t (i) is labor input, ot (i) is oil usage and zt is labor augmenting technology shock,
which follows the law of motion given as

ln ζz,t = ρζz ln ζz,t−1 + εz,t ,

Intermediate goods producers behave as monopolistic competitors and set prices with
Calvo mechanism. Namely, they set new prices with probability 1 − θn or adjust prices
just as much as the trend inflation rate with probability θn in each period. Thus, the ith
intermediate good producer in the non-oil sector solves

Estimation

In this section, we estimate the nominal rigidities model constructed above using Bayesian
methods as in Smets and Wouters(2007). We estimate the model with Korean data for the
sample period 2000:I-2009:I, corresponding to post Korean currency crisis period.13
We fix some parameters by calibration and then estimate the remaining parameters by
Bayesian methods. We set the subjective discount rate β as 0.981/4 . The non-oil sector
production function parameters αn and αo are set as 0.448 and 0.062 respectively, using
the shares of labor input and intermediate oil (petroleum) use in total value-added plus
intermediate oil use in the non-oil (non-petroleum) sector, obtained from the 2005 Korean
input-output table. We also set αcr as 0.657 using the share of intermediate crude oil use
in total value-added plus intermediate crude oil use in the oil (petroleum) sector from the
input-output table. We set the price and wage markup parameters, µn , µo , and µw as 1.1
as in the literature. We calibrate the shares of oil (petroleum) and imported goods in total
consumption, wo and wm , as 0.021 and 0.390 respectively using the shares of oil (petroleum)
and imported goods in GDP from the input-output table.
We use the log difference of real GDP, CPI inflation rate, CPI energy price inflation rate
(as oil sector inflation rate), overnight call rate, linearly detrended log export in dollar (constructed as export in real GDP divided by real exchange rate and then multiplied by core CPI
and divided by CPI), U.S. CPI inflation rate, linearly detrended log real effective exchange
rate from BIS and linearly detrended log WTI price divided by U.S. CPI (as the relative
price of crude oil to foregin price level). We obtain the data from Korea National Statistical
Office, Datastream and the BIS. The eight observable variables match eight structural shocks
in the model and we can identify the model.
Also we estimate the exogenous VAR block with the data and insert the estimated block in
the model before the Bayesian estimations. We find a VAR with lag length one is appropriate
13

Estimation results of the pre-crisis period are presented and compared with the post-crisis estimates in
Appendix.

based on Schwartz criterion.
We estimate parameters concerning sectoral price as well as wage stickiness, shock processes and monetary policy rule using Bayesian methods after log-linearizing the model
around the stationary steady states as in Adolfson et. al.(2007) and Smets and Wouters(2008).
The prior distributions for the structural parameters are described in Table 4.2.
We set the prior distribution of the non-oil sector price stickiness parameter, θn , as a
beta distribution with the mean of 0.675 and the standard deviation of 0.2. This follows
previous research as in Adolfson et. al. (2007). We set the prior distributions of the other
price stickiness and wage stickiness parameters, θo , θm and θw , as uniform distributions on
the interval [0, 1] reflecting prior uncertainty about the possible parameter values. We set
the prior distribution of the parameter concerning the weight on the non-oil inflation rate,
ρπcore , as a normal distribution with the mean of 1.5 and the standard deviation of 0.4
and the prior distribution of the parameter concerning the weight on output gap, ρy , as a
beta distribution with the mean of 0.125 and the standard deviation of 0.1 following the
literature. We set the prior distribution of the parameter concerning the weight on the oil
inflation rate, ρπnon , as a normal distribution with the mean of 0 and the standard deviation
of 2. The zero prior mean and relatively large standard deviation reflect the lack of prior
information concerning the monetary policy response toward oil price inflation. We set the
prior distributions of aggregate technology shock persistence and monetary policy interest
rate smoothing parameters, ρζz and ρR , as beta distributions with the mean of 0.7 and the
standard deviation of 0.1. We set the consumption preference shock and labor supply shock
persistence parameters, ρζc and ρζn , as beta distributions with the mean of 0.5 and the
standard deviation of 0.1. We set the prior distributions of all parameters concerning shock
standard deviation as inverse gamma distribution with the mean of 0.2 and the standard
deviation of 2. We also estimate the structural shocks covariance matrix Σ∗ in the VAR
block, which is identity matrix by definition, and set the prior distributions of the diagonal
elements of the matrix as inverse gamma distributions with the mean of 1 and the standard
deviation of 2. We will denote the ith diagonal element of the matrix by Σ∗ii in the followings.

We summarize the estimated posterior distributions of the parameters in Table 4.2 as well
as the prior distributions in Table 1. When we examine the estimated posterior distributions
of price and wage stickiness parameters, the posterior of the non-oil sector price stickiness
parameter, θn , is estimated to be highest with its mode being 0.945. The posterior of the
oil sector price stickiness parameter, θo , is estimated to be lowest among the price stickiness

parameters with its mode being 0.685. We note the estimated degree of oil price stickiness
is different from zero as we can see from the 10th percentile of the posterior. The posterior
mode of imported goods price stickiness, θo , is 0.805 between the modes of non-oil goods
price stickiness and oil goods price stickiness. The posterior of the wage stickiness parameter,
θm , is estimated to be lower than the posteriors of the price stickiness parameters with its
mode being 0.539.
Concerning the parameters of the monetary policy Taylor rule, the posterior mode of
the monetary policy response to non-oil price inflation parameter, ρπcore , is 1.549 slightly
higher than the prior mode. The posterior mode of the monetary policy output gap response
parameter, ρy , is 0.004, lower than the prior mode. When we examine the posterior of the
monetary policy response to oil price inflation, ρπnon , the mode is 0.121, the l0th percentile is
-3.208 and the 90th percentile is 3.319. Thus the monetary policy response toward oil price
inflation is rather imprecisely estimated including zero between the 10th and 90th percentile.
And the estimated mode represents less anti or more accommodating policies toward oil price
inflation than non-oil price inflation as mentioned in Dhawan and Jestke(2007).
We can summarize our findings from the Bayesian estimation of the model as follows.
First, the degree of oil sector price stickiness is relatively lower than non-oil sector price
stickiness as in the literature. The oil sector price is not, however, completely flexible differ-

ently from the theoretical models as in Aoki(2001), in which optimal monetary policy is the
complete stabilization of core inflation rate. Second, the monetary policy response toward
non-core CPI inflation is rather imprecisely estimated and the estimated posterior mode
represents less strict policy toward non-core CPI inflation than core CPI inflation.

Monetary Policy Simulation

In the following, we consider varying degrees of monetary policy responses toward non-core oil
price inflation and examine the effects on CPI inflation and output gap volatilities. It would
be necessary to consider different values for ρπnon since its posterior distribution is imprecisely
estimated. We further consider cases separately when the model economy is perturbed by
each structural shocks to examine the different effects of monetary policy responses to the
shocks. The other parameter values are set at their posterior modes.
We simulate the model by setting ρπnon equal to -3.2081, -0.1206, 0.0, 0.1206 and 3.3194
respectively. They are respectively the 10th percentile, the negative value of the mode, zero

response, the mode and the 90th percentile of the posterior distribution of ρπnon . We report
the results in Table 5.
When the model economy is simulated with crude oil shocks only, more accommodating
policies toward oil price inflation tend to reduce output gap volatilities without raising CPI
inflation volatilities considerably. This resembles the results from Dhawan and Jeske(2007).
Also, in response to structural shocks except for highly persistent technology shocks, an
accommodative policy stabilizes output and CPI volatilities to a greater extent. In the case
of persistent technology shocks, an aggressive inflation policy results in smaller output and
CPI inflation volatilities as observed in Table 5. This is in contrast to the findings in Smets
and Wouters(2003,2007) and needs a further scrutiny.

Conclusion

The price of crude oil has shown an increasing trend since 2002, but failed to draw much
attention due to its subdued effects on economic activities before its sharp increase at the end
of 2007. Since then, prices have started to inch up and real GDP contracted. Policymakers
become concerned with the rising oil prices as the memory of the past specters resurfaced.
In this paper, we investigate the changing nature of macroeconomic responses to oil price
shocks and find that unlike the previous years, the recent run-up in oil price are induced
by the increase in demand for oil. We also study the the optimal monetary policy when oil
is included in both consumption and production. Based on the DSGE model, we find that
an accommodative monetary policy provides a more stable outcome for CPI inflation and
output gap.
There are other candidates to explain the changes in macroeconomic responses to oil
price shocks in recent years. One may ascribe mild impacts of oil prices to macroeconomy
to declining shares of oil in consumption and production. We look into the time series for
both consumption and production shares of oil but fail to find any conspicuous changes
in the shares, which is consistent with the findings in Kilian(2008).14 We also investigate
whether the wage inflation has shown any significant differences in the pre- and post-crisis
periods but persuasive results cannot be found either. What we haven’t tried is the role of
futures market. Increased efficiency in futures market for oil could be helpful to stabilize
the economy. Nonetheless, we doubt whether the futures market alone can make dramatic
changes in the response of output and price for such a long period of time. However, this is
the area which needs a further scrutiny and left for future research.

14
However, Blanchard and Gali(2008) find the decline in the share of oil in consumption and production
results in a quantitatively significant implications for the recent U.S. economy.

Appendix II: Pre-Crisis DSGE Estimation
We also estimate the model for the period 1975:I-1997:IV, corresponding to the before currency crisis period. We calibrate the parameters using same methods as before and estimate
the model with Bayesian methods as before. The prior distributions for the estimated parameters are set as before except for the persistence parameters for the consumption preference
shocks and labor supply shocks, ρζc and ρζn , whose priors are set as uniform distribution on
the interval [0,1] rather than beta distributions with mean 0.7 and standard deviation 0.1,
utilizing more data. We also use core CPI inflation rate data in the place of overnight call
rate since the call rate data is not available until early 1990s.
The estimated posteriors are reported in Table 6. They are similar to the posteriors from
the post currency crisis period. Now the oil prices are somewhat less sticky than before but
the posterior of the oil price stickiness parameter is still different from zero as we can see from
the 10th percentile of the posterior distribution. When we examine the posterior distribution
of the monetary policy response to oil price inflation, ρπnon , the mode is -0.006, the l0th
percentile is -3.209 and the 90th percentile is 3.323, and thus the posterior is imprecisely
estimated as before.
Also we simulate the model with different values of ρπnon and different structural shocks
and find more accommodating policy toward oil price inflation works better than less accommodating policy as before, except for the very persistent labor supply shocks as can be
seen in Table 6.
