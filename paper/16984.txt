ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a tractable model to study the equilibrium diversity of technological progress
and shows that equilibrium technological progress may exhibit too little diversity (too much conformity),
in particular, foregoing socially beneficial investments in “alternative” technologies that will be used
at some point in the future. The presence of future innovations that will replace current innovations
imply that social benefits from innovation are not fully internalized. As a consequence, the market
favors technologies that generate current gains relative to those that will bear fruit in the future; current
innovations in research lines that will be profitable in the future are discouraged because current innovations
are typically followed by further innovations before they can be profitably marketed. A social planner
would choose a more diverse research portfolio and would induce a higher growth rate than the equilibrium
allocation. The diversity of researchers is a partial (imperfect) remedy against the misallocation induced
by the market. Researchers with different interests, competences or ideas may choose non-profit maximizing
and thus more diverse research portfolios, indirectly contributing to economic growth.

Introduction

Until the …rst decade of the 21st century, almost all research and product development e¤orts in
the transport industry were directed towards improving the power, design and fuel e¢ ciency of
vehicles using gasoline, even though it was widely recognized that those using alternative energy
sources would have a large market in the future as oil prices increased and consumers became
more environmentally conscious.1 Investment in a variety of other alternative energy sources
were similarly delayed.2 Although many commentators now decry the delays in the development
of viable alternatives to fossil fuels, it is di¢ cult to know what the marginal rate of private and
social returns to di¤erent types of research were in these sectors, and thus whether the amount
of diversity generated by the market economy was optimal.3
As a …rst step in the investigation of these issues, this paper theoretically investigates whether
the market economy provides adequate incentives for research in alternative technologies— as
opposed to technologies that are currently and extensively used. Put di¤erently, I ask whether
the market economy will achieve the e¢ cient amount of diversity in research or whether it will
tend to encourage research to be excessively concentrated in some research lines and products.
The main contributions of this paper are twofold. The …rst is to develop a dynamic model
of innovation that can be used to analyze the issues of equilibrium and optimal amounts of
diversity of technological progress. The second is to use this model to show that there is a
natural mechanism leading to “too little diversity”. I also suggest that a counteracting force
against the potential lack of diversity in research may be the “diversity of researchers”: because
of di¤erent competences, beliefs or preferences, researchers may choose to direct their research
towards areas that are under-explored by others and this may partially redress the ine¢ ciently
low level of diversity of research in the market economy.
The mechanism at the heart of this paper is as follows: given the patent system we have
in place, an innovation creates positive externalities on future innovations that will build on its
discoveries and advances. The patent system makes sure that no other …rm can copy the current
innovation (and in particular, it requires an innovation to be di¤erent from “prior art”in the area;
see, for example, Scotchmer, 2005). However, provided that a certain “required inventive step”
is exceeded, a new innovation, even if it builds on prior patented knowledge, would not have to

sources.
2
For example, as of 2006, more than 80% of all world energy consumption is from fossil fuels and less than 1%
from geothermal, wind and solar combined (International Energy Agency, 2008).
3
In fact, this question must be answered using a theoretical framework that clari…es the margins in which
the social return to diversity may exceed the private return, since even several episodes in which more diverse
investments would have increased productivity (or growth) ex post would not establish that more diversity would
have increased expected productivity ex ante.

make royalty payments. In fact, an important objective and a great virtue of the patent system
is to make knowledge freely available to future innovators and thus some amount of “building
on the shoulders of past innovations” is clearly both desirable and unavoidable. In addition,
patent life is capped at 20 years, so even externalities created on further innovations that do
not meet the inventive step requirement cannot be fully internalized. The key observation here
is that this positive externality on future innovations will a¤ect di¤erent types of innovations
di¤erentially.
Consider two potential products, a and b, which are competing in the market. Suppose that
product a has higher quality, so that all else equal, consumers will buy product a. However, at
some future date, consumer tastes (or technology) will change so that product b will become more
popular. We can think of product a as vehicles using fossil fuels and product b as “electric cars”
or other “clean technology vehicles”. Consider two types of innovations. The …rst, innovation
A, will lead to a higher-quality version of product a and thus the output of this innovation can
be marketed immediately. Even though it creates positive externalities on future products that
can build on the processes that it embeds, innovation A still generates a pro…t stream and this
will typically encourage some amount of research. Contrast this to innovation B, which leads to
a higher quality of product b and thus can only be marketed after tastes change. Improvements
in product b will be useful for the society in the future (because tastes will indeed change at
some point). But private incentives for innovation B are weak because the innovator is unlikely
to bene…t from the improvements in the quality of product b even in the future because some
other innovation is likely to signi…cantly improve over the current one before tastes change.
The scenario described above highlights a general feature: the recognition that there will be
further innovations will discourage research in areas that will generate new products or technologies for the future relative to improving currently used products, processes, or technologies.
Consequently, in equilibrium, too much research will be devoted to currently successful product
and technology lines— in the above example, innovation A. I refer to this situation as “lack of
diversity in research” (or alternatively as “too much conformity”).
This paper shows how these ideas can be formalized using a dynamic model of innovation.
Using this model, it formalizes the ideas discussed above and clari…es the conditions under
which there will be too little diversity in research. In particular, it shows that provided that the
probability (‡ow rate in continuous time) of changes in tastes is su¢ ciently high, the market
equilibrium involves too little diversity and too little growth. It should be noted that the
theoretical result of “lack of diversity in research”is not a consequence of lack of complementarity
in research e¤ort. In particular, in the baseline model future research builds on the “shoulders”
of past research so that there is a force pushing against too much diversity (both in equilibrium

2

and in the socially optimal allocation). Crucially, however, private incentives are more likely to
internalize the bene…ts resulting from this type of building on the shoulders of past giants and
less likely to internalize the bene…ts that they create for future research by increasing diversity,
which is the mechanism leading to ine¢ ciently low diversity in the model’s equilibrium.
As the discussion here illustrates, this pattern is predicated on a speci…c patent system.
Naturally, an alternative patent system that internalizes all positive externalities created on
future innovations would solve this problem. However, such a patent system is di¤erent from
what we observe in practice and also di¢ cult to implement. For example, such a patent system
would require all innovations in laser technology or solid-state physics to make royalty payments
to Heisenberg, Einstein and Bohr or all steam engine innovations to make payments to Newcomen
and Watts (or to their o¤spring).
While the baseline model here suggests that in an idealized economy there will be too little—
in fact no— diversity in research even though innovations being directed at a wider set of research
lines is socially optimal, in practice a society may generate a more diverse set of research output
because of “diversity of researchers”. In particular, if the society has or generates a set of researchers with di¤erent competencies, preferences and beliefs, then part of its research e¤ort will
be directed at alternative products and technologies rather than all e¤ort being concentrated
on current technology leaders. For instance, in the context of the above example, even though
incentives to improve product a may be greater than those for product b, some researchers may
have a comparative advantage in the type of research that product b requires or may have heterogeneous beliefs, making them more optimistic about the prospect of a change in tastes, thus
strengthening their desire to undertake research for product b. Although this kind of researcher
diversity will not restore the Pareto optimal amount of diversity in research, it will act as a
countervailing force against the market incentives that imply too much homogenization. Thus
the analysis here also suggests why having a more diverse set of researchers and scientists might
be useful for a society’s long-run technological progress and growth potential. This intuition
is formalized by showing that a greater diversity in the competences of researchers increases
research directed at substitute varieties and the equilibrium rate of economic growth.
Popular discussions often emphasize the importance of diversity in various settings, including
in research, and also stress that non-pro…t motives are important in research. The framework
here o¤ers a simple formalization of both ideas: diversity in research is important for economic
growth but the market economy may not provide su¢ cient incentives for such diversity; diversity
of researchers, in fact their non-pro…t-seeking or “nerdy” behavior and responsiveness to nonmonetary riwards, may be socially bene…cial as a remedy for the lack of diversity (too much
conformity) in research.

3

The model used here is related to the endogenous technological change literature, for example, Romer (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991), and Aghion and Howitt (1992). This
literature typically does not investigate the diversity of research. In addition, the “lock-in”
e¤ects in technology choices emphasized by Nelson and Winter (1982) and Arthur (1989) and
the subsequent literature building on these works are closely related to the main mechanism
leading to too little equilibrium diversity in the current model, though the modeling approaches
are very di¤erent (the approach here builds on endogenous technological change models with
forward-looking innovation decisions, while these alternative approaches rely on learning by doing externalities and organizational constraints on the type of research). In this respect, our
approach is also close related to and builds on Katz and Shapiro’s (1986) model of network
externalities.
A smaller literature investigates the determinants of microeconomic incentives towards the
direction of research. Aghion and Tirole (1994) is an early contribution, focusing on incentive
problems that arise in the management of innovation. More recently, Brock and Durlauf (1999)
investigate equilibrium choice of research topic in scienti…c communities. Aghion, Dewatripont
and Stein (2007) analyze the implications of academic freedom, while Murray, Aghion, Dewatripont, Kolev and Scott (2008) empirically investigate the e¤ect of scienti…c openness on further
research. Jones (2009) argues that scienti…c research is becoming more di¢ cult because there is
now larger body of existing knowledge that needs to be absorbed and shows how this can explain
why major breakthroughs happen later in the lives of scientists and why scienti…c collaborations
have become more common. Bramoullé and Saint-Paul (2008) construct a model of research
cycles, where equilibrium research ‡uctuates between invention of new lines of research and
development of existing lines. Acemoglu, Bimpikis and Ozdaglar (2008) propose a model where
…rms might have incentives to delay research and copy previous successful projects rather than
engage in simultaneous search. None of these papers highlight or analyze the issues related to diversity in research emphasized in this paper. To the best of my knowledge, the only other works
that discuss issues of diversity in research are Bronfenbrenner (1966), Stephan and Levin (1992),
and Sunstein (2001), who emphasize the possibility of fads in academic research, and Dosi and
Malerba (1993), Shy (1996), Christensen (1997), Dalle (1997), Adner and Levinthal (2001), and
Malerba, Nelson, Orsenigo and Winter (2007), who discuss the role of diverse preferences of
users on market structure and patterns of adoption of new technology.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a simple example illustrating
the basic idea. Section 3 presents the baseline environment and characterizes the equilibrium.
Section 4 characterizes the conditions under which the equilibrium will be ine¢ cient and technological progress will be too slow because of ine¢ ciently low levels of diversity in research.

Section 5 characterizes the equilibrium when there is diversity in research tastes and shows how
greater diversity increases economic growth. Section 6 concludes, while the Appendix provides
an extended environment that motivates some of the simplifying assumptions in the main text.
It also contains some additional derivations.

A Simple Example

In this section, I provide a simple example illustrating the main mechanism leading to ine¢ ciently
low diversity in research. Consider a two-period economy, with periods t = 1 and t = 2 and
no discounting. There are two technologies j and j 0 , both starting t = 1 with qualities qj (0) =
qj 0 (0) = 1. A scientist can work to improve both technologies. Suppose that the scientist
has a total of one unit of time. The probability of improving either of the two technologies
when he devotes x units of his time to the technology is h (x). Suppose that h is strictly
increasing, di¤erentiable, and concave, and satis…es the Inada condition that limx!0 h0 (x) = 1.
An improvement increases the quality of the technology (j or j 0 ) to 1 + (with

> 0). At t = 1,

j is the “active” technology, so if the scientist improves technology j, he will be able to market
it and receive return equal to 1 + . Technology j 0 is not active, so even if the scientist improves
this technology, he will not be able to market it at t = 1. At time t = 2, technology j 0 becomes
active with probability p > 0, replacing technology j (and if so, technology j can no longer
be marketed). Before either of the two technologies is marketed at t = 2, other scientists can
further improve over these technologies. Suppose that this happens with (exogenous) probability
v 2 (0; 1] (and assume, for simplicity, that no such further improvements are possible if there is
no innovation by the scientist at t = 1). In this event, the quality of the product increases by
another factor 1 + , but the original scientist receives no returns.4
Let us consider the problem of the scientist in choosing the optimal allocation of his time
between the two research projects. When he chooses to devote xj 2 [0; 1] units of his time to
technology j, his return can be written as
(xj ) = h (xj ) [1 + (1
+h (1

xj ) p (1

p) (1

v)] (1 + )

(1)

v) (1 + ) :

The …rst line is the scientist’s expected return from innovation in technology j. He is successful
with probability h (xj ) and receives immediate returns 1 + . In the next period, technology j
remains active with probability 1
1

p and his innovation is not improved upon with probability

v, and in this event, he receives 1 +

again. With probability h (1

xj ), he successfully

Thus there are no patents that make further innovations pay royalties to the original inventor. Patent systems
and how they a¤ect the results are discussed in the next section.

undertakes an innovation for technology j 0 . Since this technology is not yet active, he receives
no returns at t = 1, but if it becomes active at t = 2 (probability p) and is not improved upon
(probability 1
Maximizing

v), he will receive 1 +

at t = 2.

(xj ) with respect to xj gives the following simple …rst-order condition:
h0 xj [1 + (1

p) (1

v)] = h0 1

xj p (1

v) :

(2)

Clearly, xj is uniquely de…ned. It can also be veri…ed that it is increasing in v; as the probability
of further innovations increases, more of the scientist’s time will be devoted to technology j. Also
notably as v ! 1, xj ! 1 and all research is directed to the currently active technology, j. The
intuition for this result is simple. Because of future improvements, as v ! 1, the scientist
will receive no returns from innovation in technology j 0 — somebody else will have invented even

a better version of this technology by the time it can be marketed. There will be a similar
improvement over technology j if it remains active until t = 2, but the scientist will in the
meantime receive returns from being able to market it immediately (during t = 1). Thus
the prospect of future improvements over the current innovation disproportionately favors the
currently-active technology. This intuition also explains why xj is increasing in v.
For comparison, let us consider the research allocation choice of a planner wishing to maximize total value of output. This can be written as
h
i
(xj ) = h (xj ) (1 + (1 p) (1 v) (1 + )) + (1 p) v (1 + )2
h
i
+h (1 xj ) p (1 v) (1 + ) + pv (1 + )2 :
This di¤ers from (1) because the planner also bene…ts when there is another innovation building
on the shoulders of the innovation of the scientist at t = 1. The allocation of time between the
two technologies that would maximize
h0 xSj [(1 + (1

p) (1

v)) + (1

(xj ) is given by the following …rst-order condition:
p) v (1 + )] = h0 1

xSj [p (1

v) + pv (1 + )] :

It can be veri…ed that xSj < xj , so that the social planner would always prefer to allocate more
of the scientist’s time to technology j 0 (and thus less of his time to the active technology).
Interestingly, xSj is decreasing in v. In particular, even as v ! 1, xSj > 0. Intuitively, the social

planner values the improvements in technology j 0 more than the scientist because the society
will bene…t from further improvements over those undertaken by the scientist at time t = 1. In

fact, as v increases, future improvements become more important to the social planner relative
to current gains, favoring research directed at technology j 0 . The scientist does not value such
improvements because they deprive him of the returns from his innovation. Consequently, the
choice by the scientist— relative to the allocation desired by the social planner— leads to too
6

little “diversity” in the sense that the majority (or when v ! 1, all) of his research e¤ort is
devoted to the active technology.
Finally, it is straightforward to extend this environment by including several scientists. When
all scientists have the same preferences and maximize their returns, the results are similar to
those discussed here. However, when some scientists have di¤erent preferences and prefer to
work on technology j 0 , or have di¤erent beliefs and are more optimistic about a switch from
technology j to technology j 0 , then this type of “diversity of researchers”— and the associated
“non-pro…t maximizing”behavior— will redress some of the ine¢ ciency due to too little “diversity in research”.
The next section provides a more detailed model that develops these intuitions.

Model

In this section, I introduce the baseline environment and characterize the equilibrium. The
baseline environment is chosen to highlight the main economic mechanism in the most transparent manner. Subsection 3.4 discusses why the speci…c modeling assumptions were chosen.
The Appendix shows how similar results can be derived in a richer environment building on
endogenous technological change models.

3.1

Description of Environment

Time is continuous and indexed by t 2 [0; 1). Output is produced as an aggregate of a continuum of intermediate goods (products), with measure normalized to 1. Each intermediate
2 [0; 1] comes in several (countably in…nite number of) varieties, denoted by j1 ( ), j2 ( ),....
Variety ji ( ) of intermediate

has an endogenous quality qji ( ; t) > 0 (at time t). The quality

of each variety is determined by the position of this product in a quality ladder, which has rungs
equi-proportionately apart by an amount 1 +

(where

qji ( ; t) = (1 + )nji (

;t)

> 0). Thus for each ji ( ), we have
qji ( ; 0) ;

with nji ( ; t) 2 Z+ corresponding to the rung of this product on the quality ladder. Throughout,
let us normalize qji ( ; 0) = 1 for all

2 [0; 1] and i = 1; 2; :::. Product qualities increase due

to technological progress driven by research, which raises the rung of the product in the quality
ladder. I describe the process of technological progress below.
At any point in time, only one of the varieties of any intermediate

2 [0; 1] can be used in

production. I use the notation j (or j ( )) to denote this “active” variety. Aggregate output is
therefore given by

Z

Y (t) = Q (t)

0

7

1

qj ( ; t) d ;

(3)

where Q (t) is the average quality of active intermediates at time t. The production function (3)
is a reduced-form representation of several richer endogenous growth models.5
Because of switches in tastes or other technological changes, the active variety of each intermediate becomes obsolete (“disappears”) at the ‡ow rate

0 at any point. These obso-

lescence events are independent across intermediates and over time. The motivation for this
type of obsolescence is the switch in technology induced by environmental concerns from the
“active” technologies based on fossil fuels to “substitute” alternative energy sources discussed
in the Introduction. In particular, let us order varieties such that if ji ( ) is the active variety of
intermediate

at t, then when it disappears the active variety becomes ji+1 ( ). With a slight

abuse of notation, at any point in time I use j to denote the currently active variety and j 0 to
denote the next variety.
There is a continuum of “scientists,” with measure normalized to 1. A scientist can work
either on active varieties or on substitute varieties.6 A scientist working on active varieties
discovers a higher quality version of one of the intermediates at the ‡ow rate

> 0. Which

intermediate the innovation will be for is determined randomly with uniform probability. The
quality ladder structure introduced above implies that an innovation starting from an intermediate of quality q leads to a new quality equal to (1 + ) q.
A scientist working on substitute varieties discovers a higher quality version of the nextin-line substitute for one of the intermediates at the ‡ow rate

, where

1 (again chosen

with uniform probability). This assumption implies that if the current active variety is ji ( ) for
intermediate , then substitute research could lead to the invention of a higher quality version
of ji+1 ( ). Following such a discovery, the quality of the substitute variety increases from q 0 to
(1 + ) q 0 . The presence of the term

allows innovation for substitute varieties to be easier than

innovation for active varieties, for example, because the availability of a more advanced active
variety makes some of these improvements for the related substitute variety more straightforward
to discover or implement. Since improvements in the quality of substitute varieties also take the
form of moving up in the rungs of the quality ladder, we can summarize the quality di¤erences
between active and substitute varieties by the di¤erence in the number of steps (“quality gap”)
in the ladder between the two, which I will denote by n ( ; t) or simply by n ( ) or n. Formally,
n ( ; t)

nji ( ; t)

nji+1 ( ; t) :

In addition to endogenous quality improvements, there are “exogenous” quality improvements for all substitute varieties. In particular, if variety ji ( ) is the active one for intermediate
5
The Appendix sketches one such model, which leads to a structure identical to the reduced-form model used
here.
6
See the Appendix for a model in which research is also directed to speci…c intermediates.

8

, then I assume that any i + 1 > i cannot be more than N steps behind the currently active
variety ji ( ). In other words, qji+1 ( ; t) cannot be less than qji ( ; t) when the quality of the
active variety is qji ( ; t), where
(1 + )
for some N 2 N (and thus

< 1).

N

The speci…cation in particular implies that if the

quality of the active variety increases from qji ( ; t) to qji ( ; t+) = (1 + ) qji ( ; t) and we
have qji+1 ( ; t) = qji ( ; t), then the quality of the substitute variety i + 1 also increases to
qji+1 ( ; t+) =

(1 + ) qji ( ; t).7 As a consequence, when a switch (from j to j 0 ) happens we

always have qj 0 ( ; t)
all

qj ( ; t). Furthermore, suppose throughout that qj 0 ( ; t)

qj ( ; t) for

2 [0; 1]— substitute varieties cannot be more advanced than active varieties.
What about the gap between the substitute variety ji+1 ( ) and its substitute ji+2 ( )? I

assume that research on substitute varieties creates a positive spillover on the quality of varieties
beyond the immediate substitute (in particular, on i + 2), so that when be the gap between i + 1
and i is n so will the gap between i + 2 and i + 1, i.e., nji+1 ( ; t)

nji+2 ( ; t) = nji ( ; t)

nji+1 ( ; t). This assumption simpli…es the analysis by allowing for an explicit characterization
of the stationary distribution of quality gaps.8
I also assume that
1

;

(4)

so that the relative ease of innovation in substitute varieties does not exceed the productivity
advantage of the active varieties.
The patent system functions as follows. A scientist who has invented a higher quality (of
the active variety) of some intermediate has a perfectly enforced patent and receives a revenue
equal to the contribution of its intermediate to total output. That is, a scientist with a patent
on the active variety of an intermediate with quality (1 + ) q receives a ‡ow revenue of

q,

since the contribution of this intermediate to total output over the next highest quality, q,
is (1 + ) q

q = q.9 Importantly, an improvement over this variety (for example, leading to

quality (1 + ) q) does not constitute a patent infringement and thus the scientist in question does
not receive any revenues after another scientist improves the quality of this variety. Similarly,
7

The notation qji ( ; t+) stands for qji ( ; t) just after time t.
In fact, all that is necessary is the weaker assumption that nji+1 ( ; t) nji+2 ( ; t) has the same stochastic
distribution as nji ( ; t) nji+1 ( ; t). This will be the case, for example, under the following scenario: using the
same notation as below, let pu denote the ‡ow rate of innovation in the active variety and pd denote the ‡ow
rate of innovation in the next in line substitute variety; then the ‡ow rate of innovation in the substitute of the
substitute needs to be approximately p2d =pu (see equation (17)).
9
This expression assumes that the current scientist is not the holder of the next highest quality. As shown
below, this is without loss of any generality.
More generally, we could assume that the scientist receives a ‡ow revenue of
q for some
2 (0; 1], with
identical results. The model presented in the Appendix corresponds to the case in which 2 (0; 1).
8

9

scientists that undertake inventions improving the quality of the substitute variety are also
awarded a perfectly enforced patent and can receive a ‡ow revenue of q for their product of quality
q if (and after) the active variety of this intermediate disappears. Also, suppose that if there
is a further innovation for the active variety, from qj ( ; t) to qj ( ; t+) = (1 + ) qj ( ; t), then
the next-in-line substitute variety of intermediate

of quality qj 0 ( ; t+) = (1 + ) qj ( ; t+)

becomes freely available. Consequently, subsequent to such an innovation in the active variety,
all substitute varieties with quality q

qj 0 ( ; t+) would receive no revenues even if the active

variety were to disappear. Therefore, only holders of a patent for substitute varieties of quality
qj 0 ( ; t) > qj ( ; t) will receive revenues when the active variety disappears.10
Finally, let us assume that scientists maximize the (expected) net present discounted value
of their revenues with discount rate r > 0.
Given the above description, an equilibrium in this economy is given by a time path of
research decisions by scientists that maximize their net present discounted values (in particular,
they choose whether to undertake research directed at active or substitute varieties) and the
distribution of technology gaps between sectors. More formally, let ! (t) 2 [0; 1] be the fraction
of researchers at time t undertaking research in substitute varieties and

n (t)

2 [0; 1] be the

fraction of intermediates where the gap between the active variety ji ( ) and the next substitute
variety ji+1 ( ) is n = 0; 1; :::; N steps. An equilibrium can then be represented by time paths of
! (t) and
and

(for n = 0; 1; :::; N ). A stationary equilibrium is an allocation in which ! (t) = !
(for n = 0; 1; :::; N ) for all t. I focus on stationary equilibria.

Equilibrium with No Diversity

In this subsection, I show that all scientists undertaking research on active varieties, that is,
! (t) = 0 for all t, is a stationary equilibrium. I provide additional details on this equilibrium
and conditions for this to be the unique equilibrium in the next subsection.
Consider such a candidate (stationary) equilibrium. Then the value of holding the patent to
the active intermediate of quality (1 + ) q is
rV (q) = q

This is intuitive. The scientist receives a revenue of q (= (1 + ) q

or (ii) there is a new innovation, which happens at the ‡ow rate

is normalized to 1).11 Following both events, the scientist loses his patent on this product.
Therefore, the right-hand side of (5) must be equal to the discount rate, r, times the value
of the patent.12 Note also that given the large number (“continuum”) of other scientists, the
likelihood that he will be the one inventing the next highest quality is zero. This also explains
why assuming that patents on the highest and the next highest qualities are never held by the
same scientist is without loss of any generality.13 Equation (5) gives the value of holding the
patent for active intermediate of quality q as:
V (q) =

q

Therefore, the value of directing research to active varieties can be written as

where recall that Q
0 qj ( ) d . In particular, such research will lead to a successful innova-

tion at the ‡ow rate

for one of the intermediates (chosen uniformly). When previously this

intermediate had quality q, the innovation will produce a version of the same intermediate with
quality (1 + ) q and will yield value V (q), as given by (6), to scientists.
Under the candidate equilibrium studied here, there is no research directed to substitute
varieties and thus ! = 0. Then it is intuitively clear that the equilibrium will involve the same
quality gap between active and substitute varieties of N steps across all intermediates, i.e.,
N

= 1 and

n

= 0 for n = 0; 1; :::; N

1:

(8)

Though intuitive, a formal derivation of (8) will be provided in the next subsection. For now,
given (8), we can straightforwardly characterize the return to undertaking research directed at
substitute varieties and obtain our main result. Suppose, in particular, that a scientist directs
his research to substitute varieties. Under the candidate equilibrium (with ! = 0 and thus with
(8)), the quality of the substitute variety for intermediate

is

q 0 ( ; t) = q ( ; t) ;
11

Note that V (q) refers to the value of the patent, not to the continuation value of the scientist in question;
a scientist is undertaking parallel research regardless of whether this product is replaced or not. Following the
disappearance of the active variety or another innovation, the value of the patent disappears, explaining the last
term in (5).
12
More generally, V_ (q) should be subtracted from the left-hand side, but under this candidate stationary
equilibrium, we have V_ (q) = 0.
13
If, as in the model in the Appendix, we were to allow research to be directed to speci…c intermediates, then
a standard argument based on Arrow’s replacement e¤ect (Arrow, 1962) would immediately imply that scientists
never wish to undertake research on the intermediate line in which they have the best product. See Acemoglu
(2009) for a textbook treatment of Arrow’s replacement e¤ect.

when the quality of the active product is q ( ; t). A successful innovation on a substitute variety
of quality q 0 leads to a product of quality (1 + ) q 0 ( ; t) = (1 + ) q ( ; t), but this is still
a substitute variety and will remain so until the active variety disappears. A patent on this
product therefore has value V~ (q 0 ) such that
rV~ q 0 =

V~ q 0

V q0

V~ q 0 :

(9)

Intuitively, this patent does not provide any revenues until the active variety disappears, which
takes place at the ‡ow rate . However, if there is an additional innovation on the active variety
of this intermediate before this event, the active variety increases its quality to (1 + ) q and
the substitute variety of quality (1 + ) q = (1 + ) q 0 becomes freely available and thus the
patent on this variety is no longer valuable (see also the explanation for equation (18) in the
next subsection). Therefore, we have
V~ q 0 =

V (q 0 )

(Q), so that the candidate equilibrium is indeed an equilibrium

and no scientist undertakes research on substitute varieties. Intuitively, the fact that substitute
varieties only become marketable at some future date (stochastically arriving at the ‡ow rate )
makes research directed at them relatively unattractive compared to research on active varieties,
which, when successful, will have immediate returns.14
Let us next compute the equilibrium growth rate. First note that for any
for

t su¢ ciently small, quality q ( ; t +

t) will increase to (1 + ) q ( ; t) with probability

t + o ( t), it will fall to q ( ; t) with probability
q ( ; t) with probability 1

t

2 [0; 1] and

t + o ( t), and will remain constant at

t + o ( t), where o ( t) denotes second-order terms in

14

t

It is also straightforward to see that this conclusion continues to be valid even if a scientist who has invented
a higher-quality substitute variety maintains his patent following an exogenous improvement in quality because of
an innovation for the active product (in this case, the denominator of (10) would be r + ). See also the discussion
of uniqueness in the next subsection.

(12)

Therefore, this analysis establishes the following proposition (proof in the text).
Proposition 1 In the above-described environment, the allocation where all research is directed
at the active varieties (! = 0) and all industries have a gap of N steps between active and
substitute varieties (

N

= 1) is a stationary equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the economy grows

at the rate g given by (12).
Clearly, the growth rate of the economy is decreasing in . A switch from the active to the
substitute variety of an intermediate causes a large drop in the contribution of this intermediate
to output. Aggregate output in this economy is not stochastic because there is a large number
of intermediates. Instead, intermediates where the active varieties disappear (at the ‡ow rate
) lose a fraction 1

of their contribution to output. Equation (12) also shows that the

equilibrium growth rate is increasing in : the lower is , the more steep is the output drop of
an intermediate experiencing a switch from the active to the substitute variety.
I next provide su¢ cient conditions that guarantee uniqueness of this stationary equilibrium.
I then discuss the reasoning for the modeling assumptions used so far and then turn to an
analysis of the optimality of this equilibrium.

3.3

Uniqueness

Can there be stationary equilibria other the one with ! = 0 characterized in Proposition 1? The
answer is yes because of the following mechanism: further research directed at substitute varieties
increases the average quality of these varieties and makes such research more pro…table. However,
this mechanism is typically not strong enough to generate multiple equilibria. Moreover, there
is a countervailing force pushing towards uniqueness, which is that more research directed at
substitute varieties reduces the lifespan of each variety, thus making patents on such varieties
less pro…table. In this subsection, I provide su¢ cient conditions for uniqueness.
To investigate this issue, we need to determine the distribution of intermediates by technology gap between active and next-in-line substitute varieties (the

n ’s),

which will also enable us

to give a formal derivation of the intuitive result in (8), which we used in the previous subsection.

13

Since we are focusing on stationary equilibria, the fraction of researchers working towards innovations in the substitute varieties is again constant at some ! (which no longer needs to be equal
to zero). Given !, I now characterize the stationary distribution of
and pd

15
n ’s.

! as the ‡ow rates of innovation of the active and substitute varieties, respectively.

Then
(pu + pd )

n

for n = 1; :::; N

n+1

Intuitively, total exits from state n (for n = 1; 2; :::; N

1:

(13)

1) have three sources. First, there may

be an innovation among the active varieties of the intermediates with gaps of n steps, which
takes place at the ‡ow rate pu . Secondly, there may be an innovation among the substitute
varieties of intermediates with gaps of n steps, which takes place at the ‡ow rate pn . Thirdly,
one of the active varieties with gaps of n steps may disappear, which takes place at the ‡ow rate
. This makes total exits from state n equal to
(pu + pd + )

n:

With a similar reasoning, entry into this state comes from three sources. Either there has been
an innovation in the active variety in intermediates with gaps of n

1 (‡ow rate pu times

n 1 );

or there has been an innovation in the substitute varieties of intermediates with gaps of n + 1
(‡ow rate pd times

n+1 );

or an active variety (of any gap) has disappeared. In this last case, if

the active variety ji ( ) of intermediate

has disappeared and been replaced by ji+1 ( ), then

the relevant gap becomes the same as that between ji+1 ( ) and ji+2 ( ), but by assumption,
this is the same as the gap between ji ( ) and ji+1 ( ), so this last source of entry contributes
2,

to give us total entry into state n as
pu

n 1

n+1

n:

Combining this with the previous expression gives (13).
Equation (13) does not apply at the boundaries, since the gap cannot fall below 0 and cannot
increase above N . In these cases, with a similar reasoning, we have

Now consider the case we study in the previous subsection, where ! = 0. Then (17) immediately gives (8) as claimed there. Next let us focus the case of interest for this subsection, where
there is research directed at substitute varieties, i.e., ! > 0. In this case, it should be noted that
we cannot simply use equation (9) to determine the value of a patent on a substitute product
of quality q 0 because there may now be substitute varieties that are n = 0; 1; :::; N steps behind
the corresponding active variety (not just N steps behind as in the previous subsection). In
that case, the exact value of n will determine the rate at which this patent may become redundant because of advances in the quality of the active variety (because qj reaches (1 + )

1q

j 0 ).

Therefore, we need to explicitly compute the value of a substitute variety of quality q 0 when it
is n steps behind the active variety. This is given as
rV~n q 0 =
where pu

(18)

0. It can be veri…ed that when

! = 0, this equation gives (9) and (10) for n = N ; recall that (10) applies when ! = 0 and
when all substitute varieties are N steps behind. More generally, equation (18) highlights that
there are three sources of changes in value: (i) a switch to the active variety status (at the ‡ow
rate giving new value V (q 0 ) instead of V~n (q 0 )); (ii) a further improvement in the quality of
the active variety, so that the gap increases to n + 1 steps (at the ‡ow rate pu giving new value
V~n+1 (q 0 ) instead of V~n (q 0 )); and (iii) an innovation directed at the substitute varieties replacing
this product (at the ‡ow rate pd giving value zero).
Using the fact that V~N +1 (q 0 ) 0 and substituting for pu

Discussion of Modeling Assumptions

The framework in this section is designed as a “minimalist” dynamic model for the analysis
of diversity of research. It clari…es the key modeling issues and attempts to communicate the
main ideas of this paper in a transparent manner— while at the same time also providing a
simple framework for the modeling of endogenously evolving technology gaps between active and
substitute varieties. The Appendix presents a more standard model of endogenous technological
change, which leads to results similar to those presented in this and the next sections. A natural
question is whether an even simpler model could have been used to highlight the key economic
mechanisms. I now brie‡y argue why this is not possible. In particular, there are …ve features
of the model that are important either for the results or for simplifying the exposition: (1) the
quality ladder structure; (2) a continuum of intermediates; (3) continuous time; (4) the feature
that research cannot be directed to speci…c individual intermediates; (5) the characterization of
the distribution of quality gaps between active and substitute varieties. I now explain why each
of these is either necessary or greatly simpli…es the analysis.
First, the quality ladder structure, for example, as in Aghion and Howitt (1992) or Grossman
and Helpman (1991), is necessary for the results. This will become particularly clear in the
next section, but the main idea can be discussed now. With the quality ladder structure, an
innovation for the far future is not attractive because before the time to employ the innovation
comes, another researcher is likely to have leapfrogged the product in question. In contrast, with
a structure that incorporates horizontal innovations as in Romer (1990), following the invention
of a new product (or machine), there are no further innovations replacing this product. This
removes the externality that is central to the discussion here— the externality created on future
versions of the same product or intermediate.

17

Second, the presence of a continuum of intermediates simpli…es the analysis greatly by removing aggregate risk. Without this feature aggregate output would jump whenever there is
an innovation or the active variety disappears. While in this case one could characterize the
expected value of output, working with a continuum of intermediates simpli…es the analysis both
algebraically and conceptually.
Third, continuous time also simpli…es the algebra. In particular, in discrete time, the relevant quantities become somewhat more involved because of the following two features: (a) the
probability of success for an individual scientist depends on whether another scientist has been
successful; in continuous time, the probability of two such events (success by this scientist and
another) happening simultaneously vanishes, simplifying the expressions for expected returns
from research; (b) the expression for the growth rate is also similarly simpli…ed and takes the
form given in (12), clearly highlighting the trade-o¤ between research on active and substitute
varieties.
Fourth, research is assumed to be directed to either active or substitute varieties, but not to
speci…c intermediates. This is because, with the current formulation, pro…ts are proportional to
quality q and all researchers would prefer to direct their research to the variety with the highest
q. The general model presented in the Appendix allows for a research technology that uses the
…nal good (rather than the labor of scientists) and makes the cost of research proportional to
the quality of the intermediate. With this formulation, the results do not depend on whether
research can be directed to speci…c intermediates.
Finally, the most substantive aspect of the model is the characterization of the distribution
of quality gaps between active and substitute varieties. While this introduces some amount of
complication, it is necessary since the cost of lack of diversity is a large gap between the active
and substitute varieties, which thus needs to be determined endogenously in equilibrium. An
important modeling contribution of this paper is to provide a tractable framework for an explicit
characterization of the distribution of these gaps.
Several other features of the model are also adopted to simplify the exposition and will be
relaxed in the Appendix. In particular, in the Appendix, I present an endogenous technological
change model based on a quality ladder speci…cation. The model in the Appendix does not
assume linear preferences and perfect substitutions among di¤erent intermediates. In addition,
the feature that innovations receive their full marginal contribution aggregate output when used
in production is replaced with an explicit derivation of the pro…ts of monopolistically competitive
…rms after they innovate. Finally, as also pointed out in the previous paragraph, this extended
model further allows innovations to be directed not just to the active or the substitute varieties,
but also to speci…c intermediates.

Optimal Technological Progress

In this section, I establish that when

is su¢ ciently large, the equilibrium is ine¢ cient and the

growth rate is ine¢ ciently low. I then provide the economic intuition for this result.

4.1

Suboptimality of Equilibrium Technological Progress

Since all agents maximize the net present discounted value of output and are risk neutral (and
idiosyncratic risks can be diversi…ed), a natural measure of the optimality of the allocation of
resources in this equilibrium is the expected value of output. Let us focus on this measure. First
note that if

= 0, we can ignore research on substitute varieties and the equilibrium allocation

trivially coincides with the only feasible allocation. Thus the interesting case is when

> 0.

Suppose that a planner determines the allocation of scientists between research on the active
and the substitute varieties. Consider the simple scenario where a fraction ! of the scientists
are allocated to undertake research on substitute varieties.
The main result of this section is the following proposition.
Proposition 3 Suppose that

>

, where
:

(24)

Then the stationary equilibrium in Proposition 1 is suboptimal. In particular, starting with ! = 0
a small increase in ! raises long-run output growth.
This proposition states that when potential switches from active to substitute technologies
are su¢ ciently frequent, then some amount of “diversity in research,” that is, research directed
at both the active and the substitute varieties, is necessary to maximize steady-state equilibrium growth. Before presenting the proof of this proposition, note that it refers to “long-run”
growth because it compares the stationary equilibrium growth rates to growth in an alternative
stationary allocation. The Appendix provides a comparison of the net present discounted value
of output taking into account the adjustment dynamics. It shows that the same conclusion as
in Proposition 3 holds provided that

To prove Proposition 3, let us …rst compute the relative quality gap between active and
substitute varieties in a stationary allocation where a fraction ! of scientists are directing their
research to substitute varieties. Let us again use Q to denote the average quality of active
varieties (as de…ned in (3)) and let the average quality of the substitute varieties be Q. Then

The Appendix shows that a similar result applies when we look at the adjustment of the
distribution of gaps between active and substitute varieties following an increase in ! starting
from ! = 0.

4.2

Why Is the Equilibrium Suboptimal?

The externality that is not internalized in the equilibrium is the following: when a researcher
undertakes an innovation either for an active or a substitute variety, it not only increases current
output but also contributes to future output growth because it ensures that future innovations
for this product will start from a higher base— each innovation increases existing quality by
a proportional amount. However, the researcher does not capture these gains after its patent
expires due to exogenous or endogenous technological change. This implies that every innovation creates positive externalities on all future innovators of the same (variety of the same)
intermediate. When

= 0, this externality does not a¤ect the allocation of resources, since

there is no choice concerning the direction of technological change and each scientist is already
fully utilizing all of his capacity. However, when there is a choice between active and substitute
varieties, this externality a¤ects the relative private gains. In particular, the externality has a
disproportionate e¤ect on research directed at substitute varieties because this type of research
is socially bene…cial not for the immediate gains it generates but because it increases the quality
of the substitute variety and creates a better platform for yet further innovation after the active
variety disappears. Consequently, incentives to undertake research on such varieties are too low
and there is not enough “diversity” in research.
This discussion also clari…es that the suboptimality identi…ed here is a consequence of the
patent system assumed in the analysis. This patent system is a stylized representation of the
system of intellectual property rights used in most advanced economies, where a new product
(process or technology) does not need to pay royalties to the previous innovations, provided
that it improves existing technological know-how beyond a minimal required inventive step (or
it improves over technologies that are more than 20 years old and are thus no longer patented).17
17

See, for example, Scotchmer (2005).

21

Although, in practice, some innovations will need to make payments to previous patent holders,
this does not change the thrust of the argument in this paper; patent duration is capped at 20
years, and it is straightforward to extend the qualitative results presented here to a model with
such limited patent payments.
In the context of the simple economy here, there exists an alternative patent system that
can internalize the knowledge externalities and would prevent the ine¢ ciency identi…ed here.
However, as discussed in the Introduction, this alternative patent system is both di¤erent from
actual patent systems and is di¢ cult to implement. Let us …rst discuss what this alternative
patent system would have to look like. Since the externality is on future innovators, the patent
system would have to involve a payment (e.g., royalty) from all future innovators in a particular
line to the current innovator. For example, all innovations in laser technology or solid-state
physics in the 20th century would have to pay royalties to Heisenberg, Einstein or Bohr. In
practice, patent systems do not have this feature and once a new product or procedure is
deemed to pass the originality (required step) requirement, it does not have to pay royalties to
the innovators of the previous leading-edge technology, let alone to all innovations that invented
the technologies that preceded the previous one.

5

Diversity and Technological Progress

In this section, I discuss how the diversity in the preferences, competences or beliefs of scientists
a¤ects equilibrium growth. I start with a simple variation on the model presented so far where
scientists have a comparative advantage for active or substitute research. I then discuss another
variation with heterogeneous beliefs.

5.1

Comparative Advantage

Suppose that each scientist has access to the same technology for innovating on active varieties
(‡ow rate ), but in addition, if scientist i undertakes research on substitute varieties, then the
‡ow rate at which he will succeed is given by "i , where "i has a distribution across scientists
given by G (").18 The variable "i captures researcher diversity— the diversity in the abilities,
interests or beliefs of scientists concerning which research lines are likely to be successful in the
future. Let us refer to "i as the “type” of the scientist. The model studied so far is a special
case where G (") has all of its mass at " = . To ensure compatibility with the analysis in the
previous section, let us assume that

In other words, instead of a uniform innovation rate of
for substitute varieties as in the previous two
sections, now researcher i has innovation rate of "i if he directs his research to substitute varieties.

Again consider a candidate equilibrium where all scientists direct their research towards
active varieties. With an identical argument to that in Section 3, the value of undertaking
research on active varieties for any scientist is given by (7) (since all scientists have the same
productivity in research on active varieties). Similarly, the analysis leading up to (11) implies
that the value of undertaking research towards substitute varieties for a researcher of type "i is

Next, consider an increase in diversity, corresponding to a mean-preserving spread of G (in

pro…table for some of the researchers with high "’s to start directing their research towards
substitute varieties. When this happens, the form of the equilibrium resembles that discussed
in subsection 3.3. In particular, there will clearly exist a threshold level " such that scientists
with type greater than " will undertake research on substitute varieties, and thus the fraction
of researchers working on active varieties will be G ("). The values of undertaking research
towards substitute and active varieties in this case follow from the analysis in subsection 3.3. In
particular, the value of undertaking research towards active varieties, when average quality of
such varieties is Q, becomes

In general, such " may not be unique. Nevertheless, it is clear that if

there does not exist a stationary equilibrium with no research directed at substitute varieties.
Moreover, if

increases just above

, by the fact that

(") is continuous and

(") =

, the implications of this change will be identical to those of a small increase in ! starting
from ! = 0 in the baseline model. This argument thus establishes the following proposition
(proof in the text).
Proposition 4 In the above environment, consider a distribution of researcher diversity G0
such that

(as given by (27)). Then all research being directed at active varieties is a

stationary equilibrium. Now consider a shift to G1 with support

This will increase the diversity of research in equilibrium and also raise the equilibrium growth
rate provided that

1

is su¢ ciently close to

.

Proposition 4 shows that diversity of researchers will tend to increase the extent of diversity
in research— that is, with more heterogeneous competences of researchers, equilibria will involve
greater research e¤ort being directed towards substitute varieties. Since the equilibrium of the
baseline model studied in the previous two sections may have too much conformity and too little
diversity, diversity from researchers may improve the rate of growth and technological progress
in the economy. The proposition requires that

1

is close to

for the equilibrium growth rate

to increase. This is natural, since an extreme mean-preserving spread can induce (close to) half
of all scientists to direct their research to substitute varieties, which will not necessarily increase
growth.

5.2

Di¤erences in Beliefs

A related but di¤erent interpretation of the analysis of the previous subsection and of Proposition
4 is also useful. Suppose that there is no di¤erence in the abilities of the researchers and they
24

all have a ‡ow rate

of undertaking successful innovations when their research is directed

at substitute varieties. Instead, scientists have either di¤erent beliefs about the likelihood of
switches between active and substitute varieties or obtain additional di¤erential utility from
undertaking research directed at targets di¤erent from the majority of other researchers. Suppose
that " again has a distribution given by G, with the same de…nition of

0

and , and let us also

adopt the same de…nition of “greater diversity”.
With this interpretation, the equations need to change a little, since a high " researcher
working on innovations in substitute varieties is not more productive. It is straightforward to
repeat the same steps as above and conclude that as long as (27) holds, there will be no research
directed at substitute varieties. However, when this condition does not hold, the equilibrium
will take a slightly di¤erent form. In particular, (28) remains unchanged and gives the expected
return to research directed at active varieties. Expected return to research on substitute varieties
is, instead, given by
RS (Q j "i ; ") =

An increase in diversity again as similar e¤ects. However, this slightly di¤erent interpretation
also highlights an important point: the decisions of certain scientists to direct their research to
substitute varieties may be “non-pro…t maximizing”. This has two implications. First, it may be
precisely the non-pro…t objectives of scientists that sometimes restore the diversity in research
that may be socially bene…cial and useful for more rapid technological progress. Second, with
this interpretation, if researchers were employed in pro…t-maximizing organizations, there would
be a con‡ict between the objectives of organizations (which would be to induce researchers to
direct their e¤orts towards active varieties) and the wishes of the researchers themselves, and it
would be the latter that is more useful for the society. This may then generate a justi…cation for
creating non-pro…t research centers (such as universities or independent research labs), where
the diversity of researchers, rather than pro…t incentives, can guide the direction of their research
e¤ort.

Concluding Remarks

This paper has presented a tractable dynamic framework for the analysis of the diversity of
research. Using this framework, it is shown that equilibrium technological progress may feature
too little diversity. In particular, it may fail to invest in “alternative” technologies, even if it is
known that these technologies will become used at some point in the future. The economic intuition leading to this result is simple: innovations are made for current gain— the future bene…ts
from these innovations are not fully internalized. This externality discourages research towards
technologies that will bear fruit in the future because, in these research lines, current innovations are likely to be followed by further innovations before these technologies can be pro…tably
marketed. A social planner wishing to maximize output (the net present discounted value of
output or alternatively discounted utility) would choose a more diverse research portfolio and
would induce a higher growth rate than the equilibrium allocation. I also showed how diversity
of researchers— in particular, the presence of researchers with di¤erent interests, competences
or ideas— can induce a more diverse research portfolio and thus increase economic growth.
The broader message is that the research process may, under certain circumstances, generate
too much conformity and too little diversity— with all or the majority of scientists working to
develop the same research lines. The model here emphasized one mechanism for such conformity:
the greater pro…tability of developing currently-marketed products relative to technologies for
the future. Other mechanisms may be equally important in practice. For example, learning from
the success of others might create “herding,”making the majority of the researchers follow early
successes in a particular …eld. Or certain types of research may create greater externalities and
more limited private returns, so that research becomes concentrated in “low-externality” …elds.
Depending on the exact mechanism leading to such lack of diversity in research, di¤erent types
of policy and market remedies may be required.19 If the problem is one of lack of diversity,
greater diversity of preferences, beliefs or competencies of researchers is likely to be socially
useful. As discussed in the previous section, this might also suggest a justi…cation for universitylike organizations that provide non-monetary rewards and encourage non-pro…t-seeking research
behavior among scientists. More detailed theoretical and empirical investigations of whether and
why there may be too much conformity or too little diversity in research and how the society
might respond to this challenge are interesting areas for further study.

19

And of course, if we consider a rich array of mechanisms, it is also possible that there might be too much
diversity, for example because diversity in research has greater private value than social value. This highlights
that ultimately the theoretical framework used for evaluating the private and social values of diversity needs to
be empirically tested and validated.

Appendix
Characterization of Optimal Policy
I now provide a characterization of the optimal policy, which involves comparing the entire path
of output rather than the more straightforward comparisons of long-run growth rates reported
in the text. With an argument identical to that in the text, the growth rate of average quality
of output at any t (even when we are not in a stationary allocation) is
g (t) =

denotes the fraction of intermediates at time t with a gap of n steps between active and

substitute varieties. This is similar to (26) and on the right-hand side we have the fractions of
intermediates with di¤erent gaps (which are not necessarily the stationary equilibrium fractions).
Correspondingly, with a slight abuse of notation, I use

(t) rather than

(!).

These fractions will evolve as a function of the time path of research devoted to substitute
varieties, [! (t)]1
t=0 . In particular, with a reasoning identical to that leading to (13), the law of
motion of these fractions is given by

Combining (46) and (47) with (39) and recalling the normalization that Q (0) = 1, we have

Therefore, if

the candidate solution is not optimal and we conclude that the policy that maximizes the
discounted value of income (or utility) will involve directing some research towards substitute
varieties, proving the claim in the text.

General Model
I now present a more general environment building on Aghion and Howitt (1992), Grossman
and Helpman (1991), and the textbook endogenous technological change model presented in
Acemoglu (2009). This model generalizes the baseline environment presented in the text and
shows that several assumptions used in the text are unnecessary for the results. The environment
is again in continuous time and aggregate output is produced by combining a continuum of
intermediates. As in the text, each intermediate

comes in a countably in…nite number of

varieties, denoted by j1 ( ), j2 ( ),...., again one of those being active at any point in time. Let
us focus on the active variety j ( ), and the next-in-line (substitute) variety j 0 ( ). Qualities
are again denoted by qj ( ; t) > 0 and qj 0 ( ; t) > 0, and evolve endogenously. The production
function for aggregate output at time t is
Z 1
1
qj ( ; t)xj ( ; tjq)1
Y (t) =
1
0

d

L ;

where xj ( ; tjq) is the quantity of the active variety of intermediate

(of quality qj ( ; t), so

that xj ( ; tjq) is short for xj ( ; tjqj ( ; t))) purchased at time t and L is total labor, supplied
inelastically. This production function exhibits constant returns to scale to intermediates and
labor. As in the main text, there is a quality ladder for each intermediate (of active and
substitute varieties), equi-distant rungs. Thus each innovation takes the machine quality up by
one rung on this ladder, so that following each improvement quality increases by a proportional
amount 1 +

> 1. Also as in the main text, we have that if qj 0 ( ; t) = qj ( ; t) and qj ( ; t)

increases to qj ( ; t+) = (1 + ) qj ( ; t), then the quality of the substitute variety also increases
31

to qj 0 ( ; t+) =

(1 + ) qj ( ; t). Similarly, we also continue to assume that the quality of the

next-in-line substitute variety can be no less than qj ( ; t).
New machine vintages are again invented by R&D. R&D e¤ort can be directed to any of the
di¤erent intermediates and to active or substitute varieties. Here, let us suppose that R&D uses
the …nal good as input (rather than scientists). In particular, if Z ( ; t) units of the …nal good
are spent for research to create an intermediate of quality q ( ; t), then it generates a ‡ow rate
Z ( ; t)
q ( ; t)
of innovation. This speci…cation implies that one unit of R&D spending is proportionately less
e¤ective when applied to a more advanced intermediate, which ensures that research will be
directed to lower quality as well as higher quality intermediates.
Suppose also that there is free entry into research, thus any …rm or individual can undertake
research on any of the varieties of any of the intermediates.
Once a particular machine of quality q ( ; t) has been invented, any quantity of this machine
can be produced at marginal cost

q ( ; t). The assumption that the marginal cost is propor-

tional to the quality of the machine is natural, because producing higher-quality machines should
be more expensive. I normalize

1

without any loss of generality.

Let us also suppose that the consumer side of this economy admits a representative household
with the standard CRRA preferences, in particular, at time t = 0 maximizing
Z 1
C (t)1
1
exp ( rt)
dt:
1
0
Finally, the resource constraint of the economy is

X (t) + Z (t) + C (t)
where X (t)

R1
0

Y (t) ;

xj ( ; tjq) d is the total amount of the …nal good spent on the production

of the intermediate. Thus, this constraint requires that the amounts devoted to intermediate
production, R&D and consumption should not exceed total output.
Household maximization implies the familiar Euler equation,
C_ (t)
1
= (r (t)
C (t)

):

(48)

A …rm that has access to the highest quality active variety of intermediate will be the
monopoly supplier of intermediate and will make pro…ts, denoted by

( ; tjq) for intermediate

2 [0; 1] of quality q. The value of this …rm is given by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation
similar to (5), in particular, taking into account possible changes in the value functions over
time and denoting the endogenously-determined interest rate at time t by r (t), this is
r (t) Vj ( ; tjq)

V_ j ( ; tjq) =

( ; tjq)
32

( + z ( ; tjq)) Vj ( ; tjq) ;

which again takes into account the destruction of this value due to both further innovations (at
the ‡ow rate z ( ; tjq)) and switches away from the active variety (at the ‡ow rate ).
Factor markets are assumed to be competitive.
Let us start with the aggregate production function for the …nal good producers. Straightforward maximization gives the demand for each intermediate as follows:
x( ; tjq) =

q ( ; t)
x
p ( ; tjq)

1=

L for all

where px ( ; tjq) refers to the price of machine of variety

2 [0; 1] and t;
of quality q at time t. This is an

iso-elastic demand curve and the monopoly producers of the highest quality intermediate (of the
active variety) will wish to set monopoly price that is a constant markup over marginal cost.
However, we also need to ensure that this monopoly price is not so high as to make the next
best vintage pro…table. The following assumption is enough to ensure this:
1

1

1:

1

(49)

This then guarantees that the pro…t-maximizing price is
px ( ; tjq) = q ( ; t) ;

(50)

x ( ; tjq) = L:

(51)

and thus the equilibrium involves

Consequently, the ‡ow pro…ts of the …rm selling intermediate of quality q( ; t) is
( ; tjq) = q ( ; t) L:

(52)

Using this expression, total output in the economy is
Y (t) =

1

where, with the same convention that j refers to the active variety,
Z 1
Q (t)

is the average total quality of machines. This analysis thus shows that the relevant expressions
here, in particular, the form of the derived production function, (53), and the returns from
having access to the highest quality, (54), are very similar to those in the text, but are derived
from the aggregation of pro…t-maximizing micro behavior. It is also important that, as in the
text, the q ( ; t)’s are stochastic, but their average Q (t) is deterministic with a law of large
33

numbers type of reasoning (since the realizations of the quality of di¤erent machine lines are
independent). Total spending on intermediates can also be computed as
X (t) = (1

) Q (t) L:

Finally, the equilibrium wage rate, given by the marginal product of labor, is
w (t) =

Q (t) :

Next, we can also write the value function for substitute varieties. To do this, let us again
focus on equilibrium in which there is zero R&D toward substitute varieties. In that case, with
the reasoning similar to that in the main text, we have that the value of a substitute variety of
quality q 0 is given by
r (t) Vj 0

; tjq 0

V_ j 0

; tjq 0 =

; tjq 0

Vj

Vj 0

; tjq 0

z Vj 0

; tjq 0 ;

where z is the equilibrium rate of innovation in active varieties. The relevant free entry condition
in this case can then be written as
Vj 0 ( ; tjq 0 )

q0:

First, note that in the candidate equilibrium, both the value functions of active and substitute
varieties will be independent of time and also of , and can be written as V (q) and V~ (q 0 ). Then,
an identical analysis to that in the text implies that for all

> 0, the free entry condition for

the substitute varieties of all intermediates will be slack. In this case, we have,
V (q) =

q
:
r+ +z

Free entry into research for active varieties requires
V (q)

q;

or
r+

+z

Free entry into research for non-leading vintage can be expressed as

r+

+z

V~ (q)

q

V (q)

q;

which will always be satis…ed as strict inequality whenever the free entry condition for active
varieties is satis…ed.
With an argument similar to that in the text, the growth rate of average quality of technology
is

Q_ (t)
= z +
Q (t)

(

Moreover, in this allocation, the consumer Euler equation implies
r=

+ g;

where g is the growth rate of output and consumption.
The free entry condition then can be written as
+ (

(

Thus:
(

z =

g =

Then, the growth rate of output will be positive, i.e., g > 0, if

The rest of the analysis can be carried out in a manner similar to that in the text.
