Expectations effects regarding anticipated monetary policy and anticipated inflation suggest a positive relationship. Liquidity and output effects of monetary surprises suggest a negative relationship. It is shown that intra-day data and end-of-period data will capture expectations effects while period average data will capture liquidity/output effects. Seemingly contradictory results are reconciled by differences in dependent variables employed by various authors.\n\n",
