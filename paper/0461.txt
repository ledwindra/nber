Protectionist Pressures, Imports, and Employment
in the United States

ABSTRACT

This paper assesses the theoretical and empirical basis for American
labor union leaders' contention that imports have been a big source of

job loss in the United States. It is shown, first, that identification of
job losses "due to imports" is exceptionally difficult because economic growth

affects adversely the industries believed affected by imports. Then, an
accounting framework is employed to assess possible empirical orders of mag-

nitude. The results are fairly conclusive in indicating that factors other
than import competition have been primary in leading to structural shifts
in employment.

PROTECTIONIST PRESSURES, IMPORTS, JND EMPLOYMENT

IN ThE UNITED STATES

Anne 0. Krueger*

The American labor movement reversed its support of free trade in

the 1960s, claiming and believing that "American jobs are lost" as a
consequence
has

been

of import competition. Its switch to a protectionist stance

a significant force in American political discussions regarding

trade policy. There can

be

little doubt that American adoption of such

protectionist measures as trigger pricing for steel and the mu].t:ifiber

agreement was, in substantial measure, a consequence of labor pressures
and the view of many other Americans that American labor was essentially

correct in its beliefs. Advocates of free trade felt compelled to
support "adjustment" assistance to "importimpacted workers" as part of
their case.
It is the purpose of this paper to review

the

theory and empirical -

evidence underlying the view that job losses have,, in some sense, re—
suited from import competition. The basic message is that, at least
for the United States, it is exceptionally difficult to make an argument
that job losses, however defined, have been "caused", in any substantial

part, by import competition. A first section briefly sets forth conventional theory as to the possible relationship between imports and

employment. A second section sets forth some empirical evidence about
the changing composition of employment in U.S. manufacturing industry
and the proximate decomposition of those changes into those generated
by demand patterns, by productivity growth, and by imports or the net

trade balance. A final section provides some indication as to the relative importance, within several allegedly trade—impacted industries,
of gross and net employment changes in determining layoffs, and examines
briefly the question of who gains, and who loses, in industries receiving
protection.

I, HOW CAN IMPORTS AFFECT ELOYMENT?

Different economic theories have varying models of the underlying
determinants of employment and wage determination. None of t:hem assigns
to

imports (contrasted with the trade balance) a cent:ral role in the

determination of employment,

At one extreme lies neoclassical theory, in which wages are fully
flexible, so that the number of persons employed is a function of demand

for,

and supply of, labor.

Any shift in the demand

curve

for labor is

associated with a change in employment only insofar as the labor supply

curve is not perfectly inelastic. When the demand curve for labor shifts
upward,

employment increases

or decreases as the labor supply curve is

forward sloping or backward bending. In the neoclassical model, import
competition

could affect employment and/or the real wage via

the Stolper—

Samuelson effect, with free trade resulting in a downward or upward shift
in

demand for labor, depending upon the relative factor intensity of

imports and

exports. If, as

Leontief, Baldwin, Branson and Nonoyios

—3—

and others have found American exports are relatively labor—intensive
contrasted with American imports, theory would suggest that free trade
would result in a higher real wage than would protection, and employment
would be greater or less with free trade depending upon the sign of the
slope of the labor supply curve.

At the opposite end of the spectrum is the simple IS—LN Keynesian
model,

in which the real wage is

level or other means),
level

aithe

exogenously determined (via the price

level of aggregate demand determines the

of employment. In the model, fiscal and monetary policy determine

the level of employment, and changes in imports are significant only
insofar as they are not accompanied by changes in exports.

What all these models have in common is that they treat the level of
employment as a macroeconomic phenomenon which, in the aggregate, it

surely is. In addition, one cannot associate increases in imports with
job losses unless one extends the analysis to take into account both

the general equilibrium repercussions of the net increase in exports that

would

accompany any change in imports and also the underlying nature of

the labor market (and in particular whether changes in
labor

the

demand for

are likely to be reflected in changes in the nominal or real wage

rate). It is thus apparent that one cannot legitimately view imports,
or changes in import levels, as a significant determinant of aggregate
employment.

What may make sense, however, is to examine "impact effects" on dif-

ferent industries of the changing pattern of trade. For, while aggregate
employment levels are surely a function more of macroeconomic variables
than of trade flows, it can be contended that import competition causes
some individuals and firms to relocate either geographically or sectorally

—4-.

and that such relocation may cause hardships. If one is to make economic
sense out of demands for protection on grounds of the "employment" effect

of imports, it must surely be these "impact" effects, and the short—term
dislocations that individual industries may suffers that are the source
of concern.

1

Even here, however, there are significant, and important, difficulties.
For, as is well known, there are many causes of changes in employment

composition Changes in tastes and other random factors can result: in
an altered distribution of output and employment. Competitive successes
and failures lead tochanging patterns within, as well as between, industries..
Perhaps even more important, the process of economic growt:h generates

systematic changes in patterns of employment and output:.. This is both

because: 1) income elasticities differ from unity, and employment must
therefore shIft from low—income—elasticity goods to high income—elasticity
goods if the. process of economic growth is to continue, and 2) factor

accumulation, and especially accumulation
of physical and human capital, alters the relative scarcity of different

factors of production. As that happens, the real wage accruing to unskilled
labor risea,whire the real return to capital and skills falls relative

to the return to unskilled labor. The change in relative factor prices)
in turn, alters the relative costs of production in. different lines, thus

altering relative prices of final goods (unless, by chance, technological
changes proceeds faster in relatively unskilled labor—intensive industries),
and inducing consumers to substitute capital—and skill—intensive goods

'Even if this argument proved to be valid and empirically significant,
It would not constitute a convincing case for protection: The permanent
consumption losses associated with failing to adjust would have to be evaluated against the short—term "gains" that stemmd from avoiding dilocation
costs. On the size of those costs in the U.S., see Bale.

—5—

for

unskilled—labor intensive goods in their consumption basket.'

That change must occur in the process of economic growth is widely

accepted. Indeed, it would not be possible for rapid—growth industries
to expand unless resources were released from contracting industries,
and

resistances

to those changes would, by definition, retard the growth

process. For present purposes, however, a major difficulty arises: for
advanced countries such as the United States, the same labor—intensive
industries that are likely to contract relatively because of rising real
wages are the ones where import competition is most likely to be felt..

This follows naturally from the factor proportions explanation of trade':
just as industries intensive in the use of unskilled labOr are likely
to be slowly growing because of their cost disadvantage with rising real
wages, those same industries are likely to be at a competitive disadvantage

vis—a—vis competition from imports, since the comparative advantage of
the

U.S. (and other

advanced

countries) is

likely to

lie in capit:al and

skill—intensive goods.
Thus,

industry

the fact that the number of jobs in a certain labor—intensive

may

be declining is not per se evidence

that imports are the

"cause'. To the extent that the foreign supply curve remains constant
through the process, there is some presumption that the decline

in employ--

ment is primarily a consequence of rising real wage rates and the process
of reallocation of labor towards higher value—adding industries. In fact,

or an elaboration of this argument, and a simulation of the dii feren—
tial employment impact of capital deepening on labor—and capital—intensive
industries, see Krueger (1979b).

2Note, however, that it is not consistent with the Leontief finding
that U.S. exports are capital—intensive relative to U.S. imports.

—6—

if the foreign supply curve of imports is constant over time, it would
be

difficult to attribute employment declines to "import competition":

at most, a case could be made that
prevented

the presence of import

competition

the domestic price from increasing as rapidly as it otherwise

would have. In that sense, imports permit higher domestic consumption
levels of labor—intensive goods than would otherwise be possible. Only
a part of imports can be regarded as replacing domestic output: in con—
sumption.

The preceed.ing paragraph points up a major conceptual difficulty

in attempting to estimate the "employment losses" attributable to imports:
quite aside from general equilibrium problems, appropriate estimation
would entail the specification of domestic demand and supply functions,

and

in

addition would require estimation of the extent to which imports

in a particular category increased moving along a foreign supply curve
and the extent to which they rose because of shifts in foreign supply
curves.

1

It

is these considerations which motivate the method of measurement

used in the next section. Because of the deep—seated difficulties in
identifying the extent to which it is factors associated with economic
growth or it is imports that affect employment opportunities in labor—
Intensive industries, an accounting framework is instead employed.

'There is another difficulty with the "imports cause job losses"
argument: insofar as the domestic supply of import—competing goods is
inelastic, increased imports would be met by a lower domestic price, with
employment fairly constant. It is only if the supply curve of domestic
labor—intensive goods is fairly elastic that one can argue sensitivity
to foreign competition. But an elastic domestic supply presumably
implies alternative uses of the factors of production.

II, ACCOUNTING FOR THE SECTORAL COMPOSITION OF AMERICAN
MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT CHANGES, 1970 to 1976

The period 1970 to 1976 was chosen for analysis for several reasons.

On one hand,Frank has already analyzed the import—employment relation
for the period 1963 to 1971, finding that the AFL—CIO claims for the
impact of import levels on employment were greatly exaggerated and that:,

even for the three—digit industries for which imports were either largest
or had grown most rapidly, rates of growth of demand and of labor productivity were significantly larger than import growth in affecting rates

of change of employment. For present purposes, the year 1970, rather 1971,
was chosen as an initial year for several reasons: 1) the existence of
Frank's work covering the 1960s; 2) 1970 marked the year before dollar

devaluation and is often pinpointed as the time when the large increase
in imports started; and 3) because dollar devaluation took place in

the

middle of 1971, price statistics for 1971 to 1976 are somewhat: less reliable
than those for 1970 to 1976.

The choice of 1976 for a terminal year was affected by several factors:

1) it was the latest year for which data were available as of the time
the

computations were undertaken; 2) it

was still a year of ie.ss—t:han.

full—employment in the United States, so that concern with jobs and em-

ployment opportunities was perhaps better focused than was the case in
the

years 1977 and

1978 when

the overall unemployment rate was

lower;

and 3) the price adjustments of 1974 and 1975 had had a chance to work
their way through the system, so that data for 1976 may better reflect

underlying long—term factors than data for earlier years. It should be
noted also that the l970s were the period during which concern about import

—8--

should therefore enable a judgment asto its validity.1

11t should be noted, however, that the LDC share of imports into
the OECD countries remained relatively small in 1976 and subsequent years.
Manufactured exports from developing to industrialized countries in 1976
constituted 9.9 percent of total manufactured imports by industrialized
countries, and only 1.6 percent of consumption of manufactured products
in developed countries. See World Bank, World Development Report 1979,
P. 21.

Using these relations, data were collected for 1970 and 1976.

Despite the apparent simplicity of the accounting framework, there is

nothing simple about data collection: trade statistics are on a commodity
basis, output and employment statistics are on an industry basis, and

price statistics are compiled on yet a third basis. Considerable
effort is involved in reconciling these three groups of data.

balance, rather than imports, is used, employment and labor product:ivity

growth rates are unaffected. Thus, "true" domestic utilization can
be derived by adding the difference between the trade balance rate and

the import rate to the domestic demand growth rates. For example, for
electrical and electronic equipment the import share decreased at a
rate of -. 90 percent while the share of the net trade balance declined

at a rate of —l4 percent. Thus, part of the increase in imports was
offset by growth of exports, and the growth of domestic utilization,
defined as Q

+M

Examination

X, was 1.44 percent annually (2.20 — .90

.14).

of the data in Table 1 suggests that rates of change in

domestic demand and labor productivity were quantitatively larger than
the rate of growth of import share in all two digit sectors except for
leather, even without taking into account the behavior of exports in t:he

same sectors. Moreover, in only three sectors —

electrical

equipment, apparel, and miscellaneous manufactures ——
declined could employment have grown

with

in

and electronic

which employment

a constant import share even

if demand and labor productivity had followed their actual course.
These conclusions emerge even more strongly if the net t:rade balance

colii, rather than the 'import columa, is examined. For miscellaneous
manufacturing,

the increase in exports was sufficient to change the sign

of the trade effect.
It thus seems difficult to attach much credence, at the two—digit

level, to the arguments that imports have
ment. There are two

objections that

significantly impacted employ-

have been raised to that conclusion..

On one hand, proponents of protection have asserted that increases in
labor productivity may be associated with import competition; on the

other hand, it can be argued that more disaggregated data would tell a
different

story.

—1 3—

The first argument ——

that

increasing imports result in increased

rates of labor productivity growth ——

is

difficult to evaluate. If it

is true, it would significantly increase the welfare losses associated

with any protectionist measures. it is not, therefore, necessarily an
argument in favor of protection. At the two—digit level, however, there
does not appear to be any

simple

relationship between productivity growth

rates and imports: a regression of the rate of growth of labor product—
ivity

a

on

the rate of growth of imports (from the data in Table 1) yields

negative

(—.03) but statistically insignificant coefficient. It seems

equally plausible that increased imports might spur domestic entrepreneurs
to a greater efficiency, and that industries with slow rates of productivity growth (and therefore above—average rates of increases in price)

would be the ones most likely affected by import competition.. There is
no compelling reason why causation should be the same in all findustries.

While further research might yield fruitful results in clarifying the
relationship between import competition and domestic efficiency, it seems
reasonable to conclude that the productivity—import competitioa argument
can go either way and

is

certainly not well enough documented to serve

as a basis for either a free trade or a protectionist case given the
present state of knowledge.

The second argument ——

that

two—digit industries are not sufficiently

disaggregated —— has more appeal. It should be noted, however, that the

more disaggregated the industry, the higher in absolute value the price

elasticity of demand facing it is likely to be. To that extent, even
where import competition appears to be a significant factor, there is
a question about the extent to which protection would result in increased
domestic production levels, rather than reduced domestic consumption levels.

—14—

Nonetheless, in an attempt to evaluate the contention, the available
data were collected on four—digit subsectors of the two—digit industries:
textiles, apparel, leather products, and

electrical

and

electronic

equip-

ment. These are the four sectors which are most widely regarded as having
experienced significant dislocation due to import competition. Unfortunately,
the necessity to obtain price deflators becomes increasingly .difficiilt as

the definition of an industry narrows, and the number of subsectors for
which it was possible to estimate output, trade and employment levels
-

was not large. Table 2 presents the results.

As can be seen, the variation in employment growth rates across four—
digit industries is, as would be expected, considerably larger than for

two—digit sectors. Nonetheless, the general impression remains much the
same: demand and labor productivity growth rates, and not imports, have

been the dominant factor in affecting rates of employment growth. Of
the 42 four—digit industries for which data were available, there were
12 which experienced rates of employment decline in excess of 3 percent.

In only one of those was the rate of increase of the import share in excess of 1.33, and that was radio and TV sets, where employment decreased
3.72 percent at a continuous annual rate, while the import share rose at

a rate of 3.20 percent. Par the four—digit industry with the most rapid
rate of employment decline (electronic receiving tubes), the industry

experienced declining demand at a rate of 12.1 percent, increased labor
productivity at 7.45 percent, and an increased import share at 1.32 percent.

Although the data are not conclusive because of the absence of appropriate data for other subsectors, the evidence seems fairly strong that

even at the four—digit level, it cannot be so that protection, or reduction
of imports, could in any major part have offset the tendency toward reduced

employment levels at the four—digit level. Production growth and demand
patterns were far too large relative to the growth rate of imports.

III. WHO GAINS AND WHO LOSES FROM PROTECTION?

In light of the evidence that protection could not in any major way

reverse the employment trends in most declining industries) it is of interest to ask where protectionist pressures originate, and who gains from

protection. There is, first, the question of the division of whatever
spoils there are between labor and capital. As Magee

has

neatly documented,

owners and workers have generally lobbied on the same side of Irotectionist

legislation. If labor is relatively mobile contrasted with capital, international trade models would suggest that the gains to capital from

protection would exceed the gains to labor.1
There is another, somewhat re.lated,.aspect, which may be partly unique

to the United States. That is, a number of industries have relocated

geographically within the United States. Consider, for example, the data
in Table 3. They indicate the number of persons employed in the t:extile
industry (SIC 22) and

the apparel

industry (SIC 23) in two major regions

of the United States, along with total U.S. employment.2 As can be seen,
the fortunes of the two have been quite different, as employment in New
England and the Middle Atlantic States has dropped sharply since 1959,
while employment in the. South Atlantic states and the East South Central

region has grown continuously in the apparel industry, and been rising

or fairly steady in the textile industry. If one takes the states in the

1See , for example, Mayer. There also questions about the interindustry
impacts of protection. For example, insofar as the multifiber agreement has
raised the European and American price of textiles above that East Asia, one
would anticipate that East Asia would gain a competitive advantage in the export of apparel. Similar questions must surely be raised about protection of steel
2The New England and Middle Atlantic States include: Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. South Atlantic and East South Central include: Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky,Tennessee,
Alabama and Mississippi.

U.S. and partitions theni into those in which employment rose and those in

which employment fell between 1970 and 1976 in textiles, and sums the

gross employment change within each group of states, the resulting number
is that there were 29.1 thousand additional jobs in the states with gains,

and 77.8 thousand less jobs in the states which experienced losses. In
apparel, there were 103.2 new jobs in states with gains, and 173.2 losses
in states where employment fell.

All of these figures indicate an additional dimension to the problem

of declining industries in the United States industries are relocating
in areas where labor costs are lower at the same time as they are contract-

ing nationally. As Table 3 vividly indicates, the lost employment in
New England and the Middle Atlantic States was more than offset, at least
until 1970, by gains in employment in the South Atlantic and East South
Central States.

These data point up an additional consideration of some importance
if the. dislocation costs of job losses are the motive behind protection:

the pace of relocation may increase or decrease with additional protection

from Imports. In one study on the subject, Isard argued that protection
in the textile industry raised profits, which in turn raised the rate

at which automated machinery replaced labor in that industry. To the
extent that increased profits are also an inducement for expansion, and
expansion occurs in parts of the country other than where existing plants
are located, the presumption that protection can do anything to reduce
the rate of dislocation in the states losing employment is still further

weakened.
Little is known about the ways in which firms and industry structure
actually respond to shifts in demand, whether generated by protection from

imports or other phenomena. Taking a neutral assumption, that the rate of

19—

shift of the share of employment between north and south is independent
of the height of protection (and presumably therefore the profitability
of the industry, although this latter is questionable unless it is

assund that the wage is competitively determined and that the supply of
labor to the textile industry is perfectly elastic), the data in Table 3
suggest that, even had protection in the textile industry been sufficient
to maintain employment in 1976 at its 1970 level, job losses in the north
would only have been reduced from 42.9 million to 32.7 million, while

employment in the south would have increased by 29.1 million. The
figures for apparel are even more striking, as the south in fact increased
textile employment in the face of a declining national total.. If, as
seems to be the case, it is the dislocation of job losses that is the

principal concern of those advocating protection, regional consideiatar
in the United States would suggest that, at least in textiles and apparel,
a large number of additional jobs would have to be created (in the South)

per job loss prevented in New England. The illustrative numbers for textiles (which, it should be remembered, are based on the neutral but unsubstantiated assumption that the share of the south was independent of

the absolute sue of national employment) suggest that prevention, even if
feasible, of 10.2 thousand job layoffs in New England could have been

achieved only with 29.1 thousand additional jobs in the south. Thus,
three additional persons would have started employment in the south, in
an admittedly uneconomic use of scarce resources, to save one job in the
north.

These numbers are illustrative, and nothing more. The dynamics of
locational choice within industries are not well understood, and until

they are, it will be difficult to carry the argument further. It should

—20—

be

noted, however, that there was some (not necessarily highly effective)

protection accorded to the Pmerican textile industry (luring the 1970 1:0

1976 period. Given the regional shift that in fact occurred, the observed
changes in employment location obviously reflect, at least somewhat, the

losses

degree to which job

in the north were avoided: given that the in—

dustry continued its relocation to the south, the decline in national
employment that was prevented went in considerable proportion to increased
employment opportunities in the south.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Despite the intuitive appeal of the notion that increased imports
must have been a significant determinant of the ttimpact: effecttt :i.n layoffs

and job losses in the United States, examination of the evidence doeS not

support the case to any substantial degree Not only do imports into
the United States, even in the industries where they are believed to be
harming American workers, constitute relatively small fractions of total
domestic consumption, but in addition, rates of change

of

demand

and of

labor productivity growth have been quantitatively larger than changes in
the import share,

Moreover,

there are important questions as to the extent

As such, it may

—21—

addition, the fact that industries can relocate regionally in the United
States further diminishes whatever link there might be between import

levels and job layoffs in particular industries. At least some part of
whatever additional employment
regions and

states which

might result

from protection accrues to

are not experiencing job losses: an important:

question is the extent to which protection might in fact increase the
rate of industrial relocation.

While

there

are hardships involved with any job termination and ne-

cessity to relocate either occupationally or geographically,, it is not
evident that those hardships are more intense when layoffs are "caused't

by one factor, such as import competition, than by any other (such as
regional relocation, a- declining industry, or a poorly managed firm)

For the United States, a strong case can be made that social policy toward those losing jobs should be independent of whether the lost

jobs

are attributable to imports or not. Not only is it conceptually difficult,,
if not impossible, to ascertain causation, but even if one could make

statements

such as that fraction

of job losses were "caused" by

import competition, while fraction (l—x1) were a consequence of other
factors, it seems implausible that a method for identifying which

of

the newly unemployed should be treated differently.

Perhaps even more importantly, the available evidence for the United

States seems convincing that job turnovers have been nre a consequence
of the process of economic growth than they have been of imports. The
economic costs of "saving jobs lost due to imports", no matter how done,

would be very high per job saved. Not only theory, but the available
empirical evidence, supports the view that trade policy is not an appropriate instrument to deal with even the "impact effect" on employment.
