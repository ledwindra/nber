NBER Working Paper No. 25343

JEL No. H7,J26,J45
ABSTRACT
There is little systematic information on the distribution options in public sector retirement plans
and how annuity options are priced relative to the standard single life annuity. This study
examines the distribution options of 85 large public retirement plans covering general state
employees, teachers, and local government employees. An important component of the analysis
is the construction of a data set presenting the annuity options offered by each of these plans and
how the monthly benefits for these distribution options are priced. The analysis shows that
interest rates used to price annuities vary considerably across the plans. As a result, retirees with
the same monthly benefit if a single life benefit is chosen will have substantially different
monthly benefits if they select the joint and survivor annuity offered by their retirement plan.

State and local retirement plans differ from employer-provided pension plans in the
private sector in several important ways. First, virtually all full-time public employees are
covered by a pension plan in which they are required to participate. Second, defined benefit
plans remain the dominant plan type for state and local pensions. Third, public plans are exempt
from almost all provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) which
regulates most aspects of private retirement plans. As a result, government agencies are able to
set most provisions of their plans without the constraints imposed by ERISA.
There is little systematic information on several important aspects of key provisions of
state and local retirement plans and how these plan characteristics affect retirement income of
public employees. This study examines the distribution options of 85 large public retirement
plans covering general state employees, teachers, and local government employees. 1 An
important component of the analysis is construction of a data set presenting the annuity options
offered by each of these plans and how the monthly benefits for these distribution options are
priced.
The following discussion shows considerable variation in these important plan
characteristics. Differences in the interest rates used to convert one benefit option to another
result in substantial differences in the monthly benefit for retirees with similar career histories
from one state to another. An important policy question is whether the variation in monthly
benefits across state and local retirement systems due to using different interest rates affects the
proportion of retirees who select a J&S annuity.

I.

Distribution of Public Pensions by Plan Type

There has been a major shift in the incidence of retirement plans in the private sector over
the past four decades as employers eliminated defined benefit (DB) plans and established new
defined contribution (DC) plans, typically 401(k) plans. 2 In contrast, DB plans remain the
dominate form of retirement plans in the public sector. However, in recent years, there has been
a trend by public pension systems toward offering cash balance and hybrid plans and some states
now allow employees to select the type of plan that best suits their needs and preferences.
Chart 1 classifies the 85 retirement systems in our sample into the types of retirement
plans offered to newly-hired employees. Many public retirement systems have made substantial
changes to their plans that have reduced the generosity of benefits to future employees.
Throughout this study, we examine the plans available to new employees. The chart shows that
59 systems offer only traditional DB plans while the other 26 public plans offer other types of
retirement plans to their employees or allow employees to select their preferred type of
retirement plan.
[Chart 1]
While 69 percent of the plans in our sample continue to offer only a traditional DB plan
as the only mandatory plan, there have been significant changes by a number of state and local
retirement systems in the type of plan offered to new employees. Five systems now offer only
cash balance plans. Cash balance plans are a form of a DB plan but these plans indicate the

2

The most common DC plan offered by firms in the private sector is a 401(k) plan. While many public

employers can offer 401(k) plans, they also offer 457 plans. In addition, school districts organizations
often offer 403(b) plans. In general, these plans are provided as supplemental retirement plans alongside
of a mandatory pension plan. Clark, Pathak, and Pelletier (2018 forthcoming) provide a detailed
discussion of these plan types.

value of an employee’s account balances. 3 Instead of a benefit formula that is used in a
traditional DB plan, cash balance plans provide a notional account for each participant, specify a
monthly contribution to the balance, and promise a return on the account balance. At retirement,
the account balance can be converted into an annuity (either single life or J&S) using mortality
rates and an assumed interest rate.
Six additional systems offer only hybrid plans. In general, hybrid plans include
mandatory coverage by both a DB and DC plan. The DB component of hybrid plans is typically
less generous compared to the benefit of systems that offer only a traditional DB plan. Required
participation in the DC component increases the value of total retirement benefit. Twelve
systems offer employees the option of selecting the type of pension they prefer with options
being either DB, DC, or hybrid plans. In general, the DB plans offered as an option by these
systems are similar to the plans offered by systems that offer only a traditional DB plan. All of
these DB plans offer similar annuity options to their retirees and thus will be included in our
examination of the pricing of J&S benefits discussed below. Finally, three systems offer only
DC plans. 4 We will review the distribution options offered by these systems along with the
systems with a DC option as a choice.
Distribution options vary by the type of retirement plan. All the traditional DB plans
specify a benefit formula that determines a lifetime monthly benefit for the retiree. These plans
then offer a J&S benefit that results in a lower monthly benefit compared to the single life

3

McGill, et al (2010, page 381-383) provide a description of cash balance plans and how they are

managed. Also see Clark and Schieber (2004) for a discussion of the adoption of cash balance plans by
firms.

benefit with the reduction being determined by mortality rates and an interest rate. In contrast,
DC and cash balance plans have account balances which are available to retirees in a lump sum.
In cash balance plans, retirees are able to request an annuity. In this case, the monthly benefit is
determined by converting the account balance into a single life or J&S benefit with the same
present value. DC plans often allow workers the opportunity to annuitize with an insurance
company selected by the retirement system. The DB and DC components of hybrid plans
provide the same distribution options as described above.
Some public retirement plans also offer retirees the option of taking a lump sum
distribution instead of a life annuity. Prior research, focusing primarily on choices by retirees in
private sector plans, has explored the tendency of individuals to under-annuitize wealth. 5 In
sharp contrast to pension distributions chosen by private sector workers, retirees in the public
sector rarely select lump sum distributions because of the way they are typically priced. In most
public plans, the lump sum is based solely on employee contributions plus some accrued interest
rate, which is typically much less than the present value of the life annuity.

II.

Annuity Options in State and Local Retirement Plans

In this section, we review the distribution options offered by each of the plan types
described above. Given the changes in the generosity of public retirement plans, many systems
have several tiers of their plans that cover workers hired in different time periods. However, as
noted earlier, our analysis focuses only on the plans covering newly hired employees. The
analysis begins with an overview of the distribution options offered by retirement systems with

5

Reuter 2012; and Butler and Teppa 2007.

only a traditional DB plan. Plan documents typically provide detailed information on how the
monthly benefit for the retiree is determined. In most cases, the benefit formula indicates the
retirement benefit for a retiree and this benefit ends with the death of the retiree. This is a single
life annuity and provides the maximum monthly benefit available to a retiree. Many plans
provide some variant of this life annuity to insure that retirees and their beneficiaries at least
receive their own contributions back in retirement or at their death. The return of contributions
can be in the form of a lump sum payout if the annuitant dies before the value of benefits paid
reach the present value of the employee’s lifetime contributions plus credited interest. In the
following analysis, we classify all of these payout options as being a single life annuity.
All of these plans then offer additional annuity options that the retiree may select. The
monthly benefit for other options is determined in a manner that keeps the present value of the
benefits the same to the system regardless of which option is chosen. Next, we examine the
annuity options offered by cash balance plans, DB parts of hybrid plans, and the DB plans
offered by state systems that allow workers a choice among plan types. The annuity options for
each plan type is taken from documents on the webpages of the retirement systems. 6
Distribution Options in DB Only Retirement Systems
Defined benefit pension plans typically have a benefit formula that specifies a monthly
retirement benefit that a retiree will receive from retirement until death, i.e. a single life annuity.
Most DB plans also offer other distribution options such as joint and survivorship annuities
(J&S) which promise a benefit for the life of the retiree and the designated beneficiary, typically

the distributions offered by each retirement system. The information on plan type and distribution
options was found on the websites of each retirement system: https://retirement.wordpress.ncsu.edu/

a spouse. Public retirement systems also offer lump sum distributions; however, as mentioned
above, these distributions typically are based only on employee contributions plus some
specified interest rate. Unlike retirees in the private sector, public employees rarely request lump
sum distributions once they are eligible to immediately begin a retirement annuity (Clark,
Morrill, and Vanderweide, 2014).
A key question is how are the monthly benefits for the other options calculated?
Specifically, what is the monthly benefit for a retiree who selects the J&S option in order to
provide continuing retirement income to a beneficiary after the death of the retiree? In general,
plan sponsors state that the system offers J&S benefits that have the same present value as the
single life annuity based on the benefit formula. In order to calculate the J&S benefit with the
same present value as the single life annuity, retirement systems use appropriate mortality rates
(or life tables) to determine the expected payments over the lives of the retiree and their
beneficiary and an interest rate to convert the monthly flow of benefits into a present discounted
value. Since the expected payout period is longer for the J&S annuity, the monthly benefit will
be lower than the benefit for retirees who decline the J&S option.
All public retirement plans in our sample offer J&S annuities to their retirees with most
plans providing several J&S options based on the amount of the monthly benefit after the retiree
dies. The most common options are a 100 percent and 50 percent of the benefit that was
received when the retiree was alive. If a retiree selects a 100 percent J&S annuity, the monthly
benefit is the same before and after the retiree dies while a 50 percent J&S results in the
beneficiary receiving a benefit that is half the monthly amount while the retiree was alive. The
100 percent option results in a lower monthly benefit while the retiree is living compared to the
50 percent option. Some plans allow for other specified percent that is paid to the beneficiary

6

and still others allow the retiree to select the level of benefit that will be paid to the beneficiary.
Still others also provide options that are called J&S pop-up annuities. These options provide an
increase in the retiree’s benefit if the beneficiary dies first. Each of the annuity options for each
of the plans in our study can be found at
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UwKYbhFrAWxvwu_Db2oOgh5gHUb98kR_/view.
The retirement systems typically price each of these options so they have the same present value
to the system given the assumed interest rate.
Private sector DB plans are covered by ERISA which requires that J&S benefits be
offered and that they be the default option for pension participants. 7 ERISA also specifies the
market interest rates that must be used in the J&S calculations and appropriate mortality tables.
Federal regulations 8 specify that the interest rates established by the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue must be based on yields on corporate bonds of the top three quality levels. As of
September 2018, those interest rates were 3.21 percent for the first 5 years, 4.26 percent for years
5 to 20, and 4.55 percent after 20 years.
In contrast to private sector DB plans, public sector DB plans are not covered by ERISA
and thus state and local plans are not required to have a J&S benefit as the default distribution

7

The initial 1974 ERISA legislation required that pension plans offer at least a 50 percent J&S annuity

and that it be the default distribution option in the plan; however, retirees could simply request a single
life annuity when claiming benefits. The Retirement Equity Act of 1984 required a spouse to sign a
notarized consent form waiving her right to the J&S before the retiree could receive a single life annuity.
This requirement seems to have a significant impact on the incidence of retirees selecting a J&S annuity
(Holden and Nicholson, 1998; Johnson, Uccello, and Goldwyn, 2005). See Part 4, Chapter 72, Section 9
of the Internal Revenue Manual for further detail on current law: https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04072-009.

option. 9 Therefore, state and local governments have considerable discretion concerning the
provisions of their pension plans. Of particular interest for this study is that public retirement
plans are free to select the interest rate used to convert the single life annuity to a J&S benefit.
While there is considerable diversity across state and local retirement systems, most public plans
use the same interest rate that the plan assumes it will earn on its investment portfolio. These
assumed rates of return vary widely across states and are considerably higher than the market
interest rates required by ERISA to calculate minimum J&S benefits. Chart 2 shows the number
of plans that offer each of the various annuity options available to retirees in each of these
plans. 10
[Chart 2]
Along with a single life and J&S annuity options discussed above, most systems also
offer “other” annuity options that include guaranteed payments for a certain number of years
even if the retiree dies. 11 A less common option is a single life annuity called Social Security
Leveling which allows retirees to have a higher pension benefit before claiming Social Security
benefits in exchange for a lower benefit after claiming. Clark et al (2018) provide a detailed
discussion of the leveling annuity and its effect on benefits before and after the age of claiming
Social Security benefits. Finally, some retirement systems provide a partial lump sum payment
option, which allows retirees to take a portion of their retirement income in a lump sum payment

9

While state and local plans are not covered by ERISA, some public plans have adopted the requirement

that a J&S is the first option so that retirees need to consult with their spouses.
10

Appendix Table 1 lists each of the 59 plans and the annuity options offered by that plan.

11

“Other” annuity category also includes the “last survivor option” that provides the reduced retirement

benefits to the last survivor. The Idaho retirement system provides modified Social Security Leveling
option which allows retirees to combine Social Security Leveling option with either 100% or 50 % J&S
option. These modified options are also classified as “other” annuity category.

at the time of retirement. The amount of partial lump sum payment differs across retirement
systems and usually ranges from 36 months (Arizona SRS) to 60 months (Arkansas PERS) of
single life annuity benefit.
Distribution Options in Other Defined Benefit Plan Types
Besides the 59 retirement systems that offer only traditional defined benefit plans, 23
other systems offer some version of a DB plan (cash balance or hybrid plans) or choice of
several pension options. Chart 3 illustrates the annuity options offered by these plans. The
annuity options for these plans mirrors those offered by systems with only traditional DB plans.
All plans offer some type of J&S annuity and a slightly higher proportion of these plans include
a Social Security Leveling option. The details of these options can be found at
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UwKYbhFrAWxvwu_Db2oOgh5gHUb98kR_/view
[Chart 3]
Distribution Options in Defined Contribution Plans
Three systems (Alaska PERS and TRS and Michigan SERS) offer only defined
contribution plans to their members while nine additional systems include a DC option as a
choice to newly hired employees (see Table 1). Each of the DC only systems allow retirees to
annuitize with the financial service company that manages the retirement accounts. Several of
the DC choice systems have a similar arrangement while it appears that other systems offer
annuity options within the system (Ohio PERS and STRS and Michigan MERS) and Utah SRS
just allows the retiree to withdraw their funds. In addition, each DC plan allows retirees to leave
funds in the system, roll over funds to another account, or either fully or partially withdraw funds
in periodic installments including monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.
[Table 1]

III.

Calculating J&S Annuities

The benefit formula in DB plans indicates the monthly retirement benefit that a retiree
would receive from claiming until death. This benefit is a single life annuity as benefits cease
with the death of the retiree. Once a worker has satisfied the conditions for unreduced
retirement, the monthly benefit is not a function of age. Thus, holding career variables constant,
individuals retiring at younger ages will receive greater lifetime benefits.
The stated objective of most retirement systems is to offer a menu of annuity options that
are present value neutral from the perspective of the system. The first step in determining the
monthly benefit for other annuity options is the calculation of the expected present value of the
single life annuity. First, define PV[A] to be the present value of a $1 per year benefit payable at
the end of each year for the life of an individual age A, the formula for which can be written as:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴] =

𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏

𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝒂𝒂𝑨𝑨
�
(𝟏𝟏 + 𝒓𝒓𝒊𝒊 )𝒂𝒂−𝑨𝑨

𝒂𝒂=𝑨𝑨+𝟏𝟏

where Survival is the probability of survival from age A to age a and ri is the assumed interest
rate. As benefits are almost always paid in equal monthly installments, a small further
adjustment would be made to reflect monthly payment of benefits using one of several standard
methods. Then the present value of the monthly single life benefit, BSL, can be written as:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 [𝐴𝐴] = 𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 ∗ 12 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴]

This calculation is usually based on the mortality experience of the system and the assumed rate
of return on the pension fund. Having calculated the present value of the single life benefit, the
retirement system then calculates a monthly benefit for the other annuity options using the same
basic assumptions.

10

Most states provide several J&S options. Retirees that select one of these J&S options
are exchanging lower monthly benefits for the continuation of benefits after their death as
benefits will continue to be paid to the designated survivor until his or her death. For the present
value of this annuity to be the same as that of the single life benefit, monthly benefits must be
lower. The price of this insurance for a lifetime survivor benefit, or the magnitude of the
reduction in monthly benefits, depends on the age of the retiree and the age of the beneficiary.
To calculate the present value of the J&S benefit, first define the present value of a $1 per year
benefit payable at the end of each year if and only if both annuitants are living:
𝑃𝑃𝑉𝑉𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽 [𝐴𝐴, 𝑆𝑆] = �

𝒂𝒂=𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏,𝒔𝒔=𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏

�

𝒂𝒂=𝑨𝑨+𝟏𝟏,𝒔𝒔=𝑺𝑺+𝟏𝟏

𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝒂𝒂,𝒔𝒔
𝑨𝑨,𝑺𝑺
�
(𝟏𝟏 + 𝒓𝒓𝒊𝒊 )𝒂𝒂−𝑨𝑨

where Survival is the joint probability of the retiree surviving from age A to age a and the spouse
surviving from age S to age s. As with PV[A], a small adjustment would be made to reflect
payment in equal monthly installments. Then the present value of the monthly J&S benefit,
BJ&S, can be written as:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐽𝐽&𝑆𝑆 [𝐴𝐴, 𝑆𝑆] = 𝐵𝐵𝐽𝐽&𝑆𝑆 ∗ 12 ∗ �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴] + 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃&𝑆𝑆 ∗ (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝑆𝑆] − 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽 [𝐴𝐴, 𝑆𝑆])�.

PctJ&S indicates the percent of the initial benefit when both the retiree and beneficiary are alive
that continues after the death of the retiree. As the equations show, the interest rate is an
important component in converting the single life annuity into a J&S benefit. Similar
calculations are made to determine the monthly benefit of each annuity option. Many states
provide retirees with on-line calculators that show the monthly benefits for the various annuity
options given their employment and earnings history. In the next section, we present data
acquired from the retirement systems on the interest rate used to determine the monthly benefits
for those retirees selecting a benefit option other than the single life annuity.

11

IV.

Pricing of J&S Benefits

In order to assess the magnitude of the reduction in monthly benefits for the J&S option
relative to the single life annuity, one must know the interest rate used by the retirement system.
There is no systematic data on interest rates used by public retirement plans in the pricing of J&S
annuities. On-line documents such as employee handbooks and financial documents describe
retirement plans and distribution options. Most plans also have on-line calculators that allow
employees to convert a single life annuity into a J&S benefit if they login or enter their personal
earnings history, service, age, and the age of their beneficiary. However, plan documents rarely
describe the actual process and assumptions behind how J&S options are priced. In this section,
we first present information from our data collection effort and then illustrate how different
interest rates affect the money benefit for the J&S annuity.
Pricing of J&S Annuity Varies Widely Across the Retirement Systems
In an effort to uncover the interest rates used by public retirement systems, we contacted
each of the 85 retirement systems in our sample and requested information on how various
distribution options are priced. Our informational search included e-mails, telephone calls, and
freedom of information faxes. 12 Some retirement systems specifically declined to provide the
requested information on the interest rate used to calculate J&S benefit. Despite repeated efforts
and requests using alternative methods of communication, some systems failed to respond at all.

12

A detailed review of our contacts with the retirement systems is available on the project website,

https://retirement.wordpress.ncsu.edu/directory/

12

Typically, systems state that benefits for other distribution options should have the same
expected present value as the single life annuity specified by the plan for the retiree; however,
most plans do not publicly disclose the interest rate used to determine the present value of the
annuity options. After a year of contacting and re-contacting retirement systems, we have
obtained annuity pricing information for 64 retirement systems including 44 of the 59 plans with
only traditional DB plans. Table 2 lists the interest rates used by each of the systems with only a
traditional DB plan while Chart 4 sorts plans by the interest rate used by systems. The Idaho
PERS retirement system and the Delaware SEPP retirement system provide J&S coverage for
beneficiaries without reducing the monthly benefit compared to the single life benefit as
specified by the formula.
[Table 2]
[Chart 4]
Most of the retirement systems use the same interest rate for these annuity calculations as
the assumed rate of return of their investment portfolio. These rates vary from 6.75 percent to
over 8 percent. It is interesting to note that the range of rates for the public retirement plans is
higher than those current rates required of ERISA plans and until this study peer plan data has
not been available for retirement plans to benchmark. Table 2 shows the interest rate used to
determine the J&S benefit along with the assumed rate of return for each of the plans. Table 3
and Chart 5 provide similar information for retirement systems with hybrid plans and cash
balance plans along with the systems that allow employees to select which type of retirement
plan they prefer. The interest rates used by these plans are in the same range as shown for DB
only retirement systems in Table 2. Of note are a few plans that do not use the assumed rate of
return as the interest rate in their J&S calculations. Maryland SRPR uses the 25th percentile of
13

the expected rate of return to determine their rate. This was set in such a way so that 75% of the
time the rate will meet or exceed the expected rate of return. Delaware SEPP uses several rates
that vary with the survivor option and had no relationship to the rate of return. Also, three plans
use a rate that includes the impact of post retirement increases or a COLA. (Cost of Living
adjustment)
[Table 3]
[Chart 5]

Impact of Interest Rates on J&S Monthly Benefits
The impact of using different interest rates on the monthly J&S benefit depends
significantly on the probability of the designated survivor outliving the retiree. Large public
retirement systems typically use the mortality experience of their own participants. In this
analysis, we calculate monthly J&S benefits using mortality tables in the calculation that reflect
typical public-sector mortality experience. 13 While the published tables are gender-specific, each
system would calculate benefits using the overall gender distribution of the system’s participants,
not the genders of the individual retiree and beneficiary, because public retirement systems are

13

We used tables published by the Society of Actuaries in “Exposure Draft: Pub-2010 Public

Retirement Plans Mortality Tables Report” (https://www.soa.org/experience-studies/2018/pub-2010retirement-plans/), published in August 2018. These tables were developed using the data of 78 public
plans across the U.S. during the years 2008-2013.

14

required to use a gender-neutral calculation for converting forms of payment. 14 For illustration,
we assume that the single life retired worker monthly benefit is $1,000.
Table 4 shows examples of the J&S monthly benefit that would be payable if the
retirement system uses the mortality experience described above. Panels A and B both assume
the plan has a teacher population that is 65 percent female which results in longer life
expectancies compared to populations that have a higher percentage of males. On average, many
women are married to older men and thus, their designated survivors are less likely to outlive
them.

Panel A uses an interest rate of 8 percent, the highest rate shown in the sample in Table

2, and Panel B uses an interest rate of 4 percent, the lowest rate shown in the sample.
[Table 4]
To begin, we assume that the retiree and the beneficiary are both age 60 when the benefit
is initially claimed. Using an interest rate of 8 percent to calculate the J&S annuity (Panel A),
the monthly J&S benefit is $941 or $59 per month less that the single life annuity. In other
words, for the cost of $59 per month, the retiree can insure that their beneficiary will continue to
receive a benefit even after the retiree dies. The magnitude of the benefit reduction increases for
each year the beneficiary is younger than the retiree and declines for each year they are older
than the retiree. If the beneficiary is age 50 and the retiree is age 60, the monthly J&S benefit is
only $914. Thus, the cost of insuring that the beneficiary will continue to receive a retirement
benefit after the death of the retiree is $86 per month.
Now consider the benefits shown in Panel B when the retirement system uses an interest
rate of 4 percent to determine the J&S monthly benefit. For the individuals who are both age 60

14

Based on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris.

15

at the time of claiming the retirement benefit, the monthly J&S benefit is $914 per month
indicating that selecting a J&S benefit lowers the monthly benefit by $86. The benefit using a 4
percent interest rate is $27 lower than if the system used an 8 percent rate. The biggest
difference in the monthly benefit amounts between the two panels occurs for the age
combinations where the designated survivor is most likely to outlive the retiree, for example a 70
year old retiree and a 50 year old designated survivor. In this case, the monthly J&S benefit
using a 4 percent interest rate is $103 lower than the J&S benefit using an 8 percent rate.
The proportion of women in public employment is much lower in occupations outside of
teaching. As a result, the mortality experience used by a retirement system that does not cover
teachers is considerably different and this difference in life expectancy magnifies the benefit
reduction associated with selecting a J&S benefit. Consider these same calculations for the J&S
benefit using the mortality experience for public safety workers that is only 10 percent female.
Panels A and B, Table 5 show the monthly J&S benefit for this population using 8 and 4 percent
interest rates. Panel A calculates the J&S benefit using an interest rate of 8 percent, the same as
Panel A, Table 4, and Panel B uses an interest rate of 4 percent, the same as Panel B, Table 4.
[Table 5]
Because the population in these panels has a higher proportion of male retirees (and
therefore a higher percentage of beneficiaries are female) it is more likely compared to many
other public-sector retiree groups for the retiree to be outlived by their designated beneficiaries.
Thus, the differences in benefit amounts using a 4 percent compared to an 8 percent interest rate
(compare Panel A to Panel B) are larger than the differences in benefit amounts shown in Table
4. The monthly benefits in Panel A are for a public safety worker using an 8 percent interest
rate. For an individual retiring at age 60 with a spouse who is also age 60, the monthly J&S
16

benefit is only be $896 or a reduction of the monthly benefit of $104 relative to the single life
benefit. Using the mortality experience of public school employees, the reduction in the monthly
benefit was only $59 in the previous example.
These calculations highlight the role of the assumed interest rate in determining the
benefit reduction associated with selecting a J&S benefit. Lower interest rates imply larger cost
to the retiree in the form of lower monthly benefits from choosing a J&S benefit compared to the
single life annuity.

V.

Does the Price of J&S Annuity Matter?

As we have shown, most public employees continue to be covered by defined benefit
pension plans. These plans include a formula that indicates the monthly benefit that an
individual can receive when they claim a retirement benefit. Typically, retirement benefits will
cease when the retiree dies. The decision of which annuity to select at retirement is a difficult
and complex decision (Brown and Poterba, 2000; Aura, 2005; Clark, Hammond, and
Vanderweide, 2019). If the retiree wishes to provide a benefit that continues for the life of their
beneficiary, retirement systems allow participants to select a J&S benefit at the cost of lower
monthly benefits. The choice of an annuity is influenced by many personal and household
factors the most important of which is the presence of a spouse or partner. This decision will
influence well-being throughout the retirement years of the retiree and the potential beneficiary.
Retirees are typically faced with a menu of distribution options; however, the primary or
first level decision is whether the retiree wants a single life annuity that ends with her death or
whether she wishes to provide a continuing benefit to a designated beneficiary, usually a spouse.
The most important factor influencing the decision to select a J&S benefit is the presence of
17

spouse. While plans usually do not limit beneficiaries in J&S annuities to spouses, the typical
case is that the retiree names their spouse as the beneficiary when selecting a J&S annuity.
The work history of the spouse will likely influence the annuity choice. If the spouse has
been a career worker and expects to receive a pension, the retiree may consider this future
income and be less likely to request a J&S benefit since the spouse will receive a pension after
the death of the retiree even if the retiree selects the single life annuity. Other employerprovided benefits earned by the spouse such as retiree health insurance should also affect the
choice of an annuity.
The public sector workforce has a higher percentage of females compared to the entire
US labor force. As such, we might expect some different patterns of annuity choices by retirees
from state and local retirement plans. Clark, Hammond, and Vanderweide (2019) found that
among retirees in North Carolina, men are much more likely to choose a J&S annuity compared
to women (61 Percent compared to only 35 percent). The difference in the proportion of women
selecting J&S probably reflects the fact that women have lower age specific mortality rates and
are more likely to outlive their spouse. We should also note that gender is highly correlated with
many of the other variables that affect annuity choice such as the work history of their spouse.
Retirees will be more likely to choose a J&S annuity if they have low life expectancy and
are married to spouses with high life expectancy, holding age constant. Thus, the health of both
the retiree and the potential beneficiary enter into the decision making of which annuity to
accept. Higher levels of wealth may influence the annuity choice as households with greater
wealth have greater liquidity and hence more options in how to finance future consumption.
Individuals with higher personal discount rates place greater value on money in the early
retirement years. Thus, they are expected to favor a single life annuity instead of a J&S annuity.

18

The primary unanswered question for this paper is whether the pricing of J&S annuities
as measured by the use of alternative interest rates affects the probability of retirees choosing a
J&S benefit over a single life annuity. Our data collection effort has shown that the interest rates
used by public retirement plans vary substantially. This variation means that holding constant
the monthly benefit for a single life annuity, the J&S monthly benefit is much smaller for retirees
in states that have use lower interest rates. In the previous section, we showed that this reduction
in monthly benefit (holding the interest rate constant) can be in the range of 5 to 10 percent for
retirees and beneficiaries who are about the same age to 30 percent when the beneficiary is much
younger than the retiree.
In 2016, the Treasurer of North Carolina sent a request to the state treasurers of all states
asking for information on the percentage of recent retirees who selected various pension options
(Clark and Cowell, 2017). Nine states covering 12 retirement systems responded to her request
for this information. Table 6 reports the responses showing the proportion of retirees selecting a
J&S benefit along with the interest rates used by the systems to calculate the J&S monthly
benefit. This small sample provides no indication that the interest rate and hence the reduction in
monthly benefit influences the proportion of retirees selecting a J&S annuity. All but two of the
systems used an interest rate between 7.0 and 7.75 percent. Using these data, there is no
indication that systems using lower interest rates have a lower proportion of retirees choosing a
J&S benefit.
[Table 6]

The impact of lower interest rates on J&S benefits and the resulting proportion of
individuals opting for a J&S over the single life annuity deserves additional study. Public
retirement systems are gradually lowering their assumed rate of return on their assets. Since
most systems use the assumed rate of return as the interest rate in the annuity calculates, this
19

trend will result in lower monthly benefits for retirees selecting the J&S benefit. It is important
to determine how these changes will impact the proportion of retirees selecting the J&S benefit.

Note: Delaware SEPP offers a 50 percent J&S benefit to all retirees with no reduction in their
monthly benefit. In this analysis, this option is classified as a single life annuity. If the retiree
requests a higher benefit for the beneficiary, the initial monthly benefit is reduced by a legislated
formula.

Note: DC only means that the retirement system offers only a Defined Contribution plan to their
employees; DC choice means that the retirement system offers choice among retirement plans including
Defined Contribution plan choice. Michigan MERS and Ohio PERS and STRS retirement systems
provide annuity options within the retirement system including single life and joint & survivor options.
Utah SRS only allows the retiree to withdraw funds. All DC plans offer retirees to leave funds in the
system, roll over funds to another account, either fully or partially in periodic installments withdraw funds
as lump sum.
*Retirees in these plans are able to annuitize with the financial service company.

Note: Georgia ERS provides an accelerated benefit option (similar to the SS leveling): “A
monthly benefit equals to 135% of the Maximum Plan Benefit, payable for the first five
continuous years of your retirement. After five years, your monthly benefit will be actuarially
reduced, and the reduced benefit will be paid for your lifetime.” This option is classified as
“other.”
