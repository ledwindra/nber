What Explains House Price Booms?: History and Empirical Evidence.
Michael D. Bordo and John Landon-Lane
NBER Working Paper No. 19584
October 2013
JEL No. N1
ABSTRACT
In this paper we investigate the relationship between loose monetary policy, low inflation, and easy
bank credit with house price booms. Using a panel of 11 OECD countries from 1920 to 2011 we estimate
a panel VAR in order to identify shocks that can be interpreted as loose monetary policy shocks, low
inflation shocks, bank credit shocks and house price shocks. We show that loose monetary policy played
an important role in housing booms along with the other shocks. We show that during boom periods
there is a heightened impact of all three “policy” shocks with the bank credit shock playing an important
role. However, when we look at individual house price boom episodes the cause of the price boom
is not so clear. The evidence suggests that the house price boom that occurred in the US during the
1990s and 2000s was not due to easy bank credit. Loose monetary policy (as well as low inflation)
played some role but the residual which may be picking up other factors such as financial innovation
and the shadow banking system is the most important shock. This result is robust to many alternative
specifications.

I. Introduction

Does expansionary monetary policy lead to house price booms? There is an extensive theoretical
empirical and policy literature on this topic. The traditional view sees expansionary monetary
policy as raising asset prices in general as part of the transmission mechanism of monetary
policy. It works through the adjustment of the community’s portfolio as agents substitute from
cash to government securities to corporate securities; to equities; to real estate; old masters and
commodities—eventually leading to overall inflation. Another view attributed to the Austrian
economists in the 1920s and more recently to the BIS sees an environment of low inflation and
accommodative monetary policy as creating an environment conducive to asset booms and
consequent busts.2 Finally, Schularick and Taylor (2011), Jorda and Schularick (2012) and
Christiano (2010) have emphasized the importance of rapid bank credit growth, possibly driven
by financial innovation, in contributing to asset price booms.
Asset booms (especially those leading to bubbles) are often followed by busts which can
have serious economic effects. There is a long historical incidence of infamous boom busts
ranging from the South Sea bubble in the early eighteenth century, many famous stock market
crashes in the nineteenth century, the 1929 Wall Street Crash, the UK housing boom bust of

Related approaches emphasize financial liberalization and innovation accommodated by loose monetary policy as

conducive to creating booms.

1973, the Nordic crises of the 1980s, the Japanese housing and equity bubble and crash of 1990
and the more recent dotcom and subprime mortgage boom busts. This history keeps repeating
itself.
The policy implications of asset booms are significant, especially since asset busts have
often tended to lead to banking crises and serious and prolonged recessions. To the extent
monetary policy is a contributing factor, the question arises whether the monetary authorities
should use their policy tools to defuse booms before they turn into busts. A vociferous debate
raged in the early 2000s and until the aftermath of the recent financial crisis over the subject of
preemptive policy action. Central banks were unwilling to divert much attention away from their
traditional concern over price and overall macro stability. However the tide has recently turned
and the new emphasis on macro prudential monetary policy suggests that asset price booms have
been elevated to the top level of interest.
Finally, the issue still remains that asset price booms in addition to sometimes ending
with damaging busts can be the precursors to a future run up in inflation. This then leads to the
question of when central banks should tighten their policies to prevent inflation from becoming
embedded in expectations.
In this paper we develop a method to demarcate asset price booms. We focus on house
price booms for 11 OECD countries from 1920 to the present. We then ascertain whether our set
of boom events can be related to expansionary monetary policy measured by deviations from
Taylor rules as well as to low inflation and bank credit growth. Finally we use panel vector
autoregression techniques to identify orthogonalized shocks and their effect on house prices on

4

average and use historical decompositions to identify the effects of the orthogonalized shocks on
individual house price booms.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses the general debate over the
linkage between monetary policy and asset price booms, Section III contains historical narratives
on some of the salient house price booms from the Twentieth Century. Section IV discusses our
methodology of identifying house price booms and presents a chronology from 1920 to the
present of the booms so identified. Section V uses econometrics to isolate the links between
expansionary monetary policy and asset price booms, controlling for low inflation, bank credit
growth and other factors. Section VI concludes with the implications of our findings for
monetary policy.

Section II: The Issues

Debate swirls over the causes of the subprime Mortgage Crisis of 2007-08 and the Great
Recession of 2007-2009 and the subsequent slow recovery. Two views predominate; the first is
that it was caused by global imbalances: a global savings glut in Asia which financed a
consumption boom, persistent budget deficits and current account deficits in the U.S and other
advanced countries. The second that it reflected domestic imbalances in the U.S. leading to an

5

unprecedented nationwide housing boom which burst in 2006 precipitating the crisis. This paper
focuses on the second view.3
A key element of the domestic U.S. story is that the Federal Reserve kept monetary
policy too loose from 2002-2006 which fueled a housing boom that had its origins in a long
tradition of policies to encourage home ownership in succeeding administrations, financial
innovation, lax regulatory supervision and oversight and corporate malfeasance. John Taylor
(2007, 2009) has led the indictment of the Fed for fueling the housing boom in the early 2000s.
Based on the Taylor Rule (1993) he shows that the Federal Funds rate was as low as 3
percentage points below what a simple Taylor rule would generate for the period 2002-2005.
Taylor then simulated the path of housing starts had the Fed followed the Taylor rule over the
period 2000 to 2006. His calculations suggest that most of the run up in housing starts from 2002
to 2005 would not have occurred.
An earlier OECD study by Ahrend et al (2005) found a close relationship between
negative deviations of the Taylor rule and several measures of housing market buoyancy
(mortgage lending, housing investment, construction investment and real house prices) for a

3

The possibility that monetary policy can produce asset price bubbles has also been studied extensively in

equilibrium rational expectations models. In such models, poorly designed monetary policies, such as the use of
interest rate rules without commitment to a steady long-run inflation rate, can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies and
asset price bubbles. Such outcomes are less likely, Woodford (2003) argues, if monetary policymakers follow a clear
rule in which the interest rate target is adjusted sufficiently to stabilize inflation. The theoretical literature thus
suggests that consideration of the monetary policy environment may be crucial to understanding why asset booms
come about.

number of OECD countries in the early 2000s. The principal examples are the U.S. (2000-2006),
Canada (2001-2007), Denmark (2001-2004) and Australia (2000-2003). For the euro area as a
whole, they find that ECB policy rates are not far below the Taylor rule but for a number of
individual members (Portugal, Spain, Greece, Netherlands, Italy, Ireland and Finland) they are
well below it. This evidence as well as evidence in several other papers (Hott and Jakipii 2012,
Gerlach and Assenmacher- Wesche 2008a) suggests that expansionary monetary policy had a
key role to play in fostering recent housing booms, some of which led to devastating busts. Other
literature finds evidence linking expansionary monetary policy to equity booms and commodity
price booms (Gerlach and Assenmacher Weshe 2008b, Pagano, Lombardi, Anzuini 2010).
There is an extensive earlier literature on the relationship between monetary policy and
asset prices in general. Asset prices are viewed as a key link in the transmission mechanism of
monetary policy. The traditional view argues that added liquidity causes asset prices to rise as a
link in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy actions to the economy as a whole.
Another view, the Austrian/BIS view argues that asset price booms are more likely to arise in
environments of low and stable inflation and thus asset price booms can arise because monetary
policy is geared to credibly stabilizing prices.
The traditional view has a long history. Early Keynesian models like Metzler (1951) had
central bank operations affecting the stock market directly. Friedman and Schwartz (1963a) and
later Tobin (1969) and Brunner and Meltzer (1973) spelled out the transmission mechanism
following an expansionary Fed open market purchase. It would first affect the prices ( rate of
return) on short –term government securities, then via a portfolio balance substitution
mechanism, the price (rate of return) of long-term government securities then corporate
7

securities, equities ,real estate, old masters and commodities including gold would be bid up (
their returns lowered). Thus substitution from more to less liquid assets would occur as returns
on the former decline relative to the latter. Thus the impact of expansionary monetary policy will
impact securities, assets and commodities and finally the overall price level. This view sees asset
prices as possible harbingers of future inflation.
The Austrian/BIS view which goes back to Hayek, von Mises, Robbins4 and others in the
1920s posits that an asset price boom whatever its fundamental cause, can degenerate into a
bubble if accommodative monetary policy allows bank credit to rise to fuel the boom. This view
argues that unless policy-makers act to defuse the boom, a crash will inevitably follow that in
turn may cause a serious recession. The Austrians equated rising asset prices with a rise in the
overall price level. Although the level of U.S. consumer prices was virtually unchanged between
1923 and 1929, the Austrians viewed the period as one of rapid inflation fueled by loose Federal
Reserve policy and excessive growth of bank credit (Rothbard 1983).
The Austrian view has carried forward into the modern discussion of asset price booms.
It has been incorporated into the BIS view of Borio and Lowe (2002), Borio and White (2003)
and others. They focus on the problem of “financial imbalances” defined as rapid growth of
credit in conjunction with rapid increases in asset prices and possibly investment. Borio and
Lowe (2002) argue that a build-up of such imbalances can increase the risk of a financial crisis
and macroeconomic instability. They construct an index of imbalances based on a credit gap
(deviations of credit growth from trend), an equity gap, and an output gap, to identify incipient

4

See Laidler (2003).

8

asset price declines that can lead to significant real output losses, and advocate its use as a guide
for proactive action. In this vein Borio (2012) discusses a financial cycle based on property
prices and credit growth which has much greater amplitude than the business cycle and when its
peak coincides with a business cycle peak, a housing bust, banking crisis and deep protracted
recession can follow, as occurred in 2007.
Borio and Lowe argue that low inflation can promote financial imbalances regardless of
the cause of an asset price boom. For example, by generating optimism about the
macroeconomic environment, low inflation might cause asset prices to rise more in response to
an increase in productivity than they would otherwise would. Similarly, an increase in demand is
more likely to cause asset prices to rise if the central bank is credibly committed to price
stability. A commitment to price stability that is viewed as credible, Borio and Lowe (2002)
argue, will make product prices less sensitive and output and profits more sensitive in the shortrun to an increase in demand. At the same time, the absence of inflation may cause policy
makers to delay tightening as demand pressures build up. 5Thus they contend (pp. 30-31) “these

5

A related issue to the impact of expansionary monetary policy on asset prices is whether the price index targeted

by the central bank should include asset prices. Alchian and Klein (1973) contend that a theoretically correct
measure of inflation is the change in the price of a given level of utility, which includes the present value of future
consumption. An accurate estimate of inflation, they argue, requires a broader price index than one consisting only
of the prices of current consumption goods and services. To capture the price of future consumption, Alchian and
Klein (1973) contend that monetary authorities should target a price index that includes asset prices. Bryan et al
(2002) concur, arguing that because it omits asset prices (especially housing prices), the CPI seriously understated
inflation during the 1990s.

9

endogenous responses to credible monetary policy (can) increase the probability that the latent
inflation pressures manifest themselves in the development of imbalances in the financial
system, rather than immediate upward pressure in higher goods and service price inflation.”6
Christiano et al (2010) present historical evidence showing that stock price booms in the U.S.
and Japan often occurred in periods of low inflation. Productivity shocks which raise the natural
rate of interest are accommodated by expansion in bank credit which pushes up stock prices.
According to their analysis based on a DSGE model, following a Taylor type rule in the face of
low inflation will lead to lower interest rates which will further fuel the asset boom.
In section V below we present some evidence consistent with the loose monetary policy
explanation for asset price booms and also the Austrian BIS view that regards monetary policy
dedicated to low inflation and bank credit expansion as creating an environment conducive to an
asset boom. However the weight attributed to the different explanations differs across historical
boom episodes.

perspective. For a more detailed discussion on asset price booms and busts from history see

III.1 The 1920s

The most famous episode of an asset price boom during the 1920’s is the Wall Street Boom
beginning in 1923 and ending with the Crash in October 1929. During the boom stock prices
rose by over 200%, the collapse from 1929 to 1932 had prices decline by 66%.The boom was
associated with massive investment that brought the major inventions of the late nineteenth
century, eg electricity and the automobile, to fruition. In addition, major innovations also
profoundly changed industrial organization and the financial sector, including the increased use
of equity as a financial instrument. The economy of the 1920s (following the sharp recession of
1920-21) was characterized by rapid real growth, rapid productivity advance and slightly
declining prices, punctuated by two minor recessions. Irving Fisher and other contemporaries
believed that the stock market boom reflected the fundamentals of future profits from the high
growth industries that were coming on stream and that it was not a bubble. Recent work by
McGrattan and Prescott (2003) concurs with that view although many others regard it as a
bubble (Galbraith 1955, White and Rapoport 2004).
Debate continues over the role of expansionary Federal Reserve policy in fueling the
boom. In 1932 Adolph Miller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board blamed the New York
Fed and its President Benjamin Strong for pursuing expansionary open market purchases to help
Britain restore the pound to its prewar parity in 1924 and then again in 1927 to protect sterling
from a speculative attack. In both occasions, the U.S. economy was in recession justifying
expansionary policy (Friedman and Schwartz 1963b). Miller indicted Strong (who died in 1928)
11

for fueling the stock market boom and the resultant crash. His views were instrumental in
legislation in 1933 which prohibited Reserve banks from engaging in international monetary
policy actions.
As mentioned in Section II above the Austrian economists later followed by economists
at the BIS saw the 1920s as a credit boom accommodated by monetary policy. Eichengreen and
Michener (2004) present evidence for the BIS view for the 1920s as a credit boom gone wild,
based on their measures of a credit boom (deviations from trend of the ratio of broad money to
GDP, the investment ratio and real stock prices) for a panel of 9 countries.
The 1920s also witnessed a major house price boom in the U.S. from 1923 to 1925.
White (2009) argues that the boom was in part triggered by expansionary monetary policy. He
finds that deviation from a Taylor rule has some explanatory power for the run up in real housing
prices. He also argues that the Fed, established in 1914 to act as a lender of last resort and to
reduce the seasonal instability in financial markets, created some elements of a “Greenspan Put’
– the view that emerged after Chairman Greenspan engineered a massive liquidity support for the
New York money center banks during the October 1987 Wall Street Crash – that the Fed would
bail out the financial sector in the event of a crash. Unlike the Wall Street stock market boom,
the housing boom bust in the 1920s had little impact on the economy as a whole or on the
financial system.

12

III.2 Post World War II

The post war period has exhibited a large number of housing boom busts. Many of these
episodes occurred in an environment of loose monetary policy. We briefly discuss a number of
salient episodes.

III.2.1 Asset Booms in the UK.

The UK had a massive house price and stock market boom in 1971-1974, referred to by Tim
Congdon (2005) as the Heath Barber Boom after the then Prime Minister and Chancellor of the
Exchequer. Congdon documents the rapid growth in broad money (M4) after the passage of the
Competition and Credit Control Bill in 1971 which liberalized the UK financial system and
ended the rate setting cartel of the London clearing banks. He shows both rapid growth in M4
and a shift in its composition towards balances held by the corporate and financial sectors away
from the household sectors. Following the Friedman and Schwartz (1963) transmission story, the
excess cash balances went into equities first and properties second, greatly pushing up their
prices. The big asset price booms were soon followed by an unprecedented rise in inflation to
close to 20% per year by the end of the 1970s. Congdon also shows a tight connection between
expansion in broad money supply in 1986/87 and subsequent asset price booms which he calls
the Lawson boom after the Chancellor of the Exchequer. As in the 1970s boom, rapid growth in
M4 and in its holdings by the corporate and financial sectors fueled a stock market boom which
13

burst in 1987 and a housing boom which burst in 1989. Finally he attributes a big run up in
financial sector real broad money holdings in 1997/98 to an equities boom in the late 90s and a
housing boom which peaked in 2006.

III.2.2 Nordic Asset Booms in the 1980s

The Nordic countries, Norway, Sweden and Finland all experienced major asset booms and busts
in the 1980s. In each country the run up in asset prices followed liberalization of their financial
sectors after 5 decades of extensive controls on lending rates and government control over the
sectoral allocation of bank lending. Asset booms were accommodated by expansionary monetary
policy as each country adhered to pegged exchange rates which tended to make monetary policy
pro-cyclical.
In the case of Norway, quantitative restrictions on bank lending were lifted in 1984
without allowing interest rates to rise. Real interest rates were low and sometimes negative.
Banks used their newborn freedom to expand lending on a large scale, all of them with a firm
desire to increase their market shares. This stimulated a massive real estate boom until 1986. The
boom ended with tighter monetary policy in 1986. The legacy of the collapse of the real estate
boom and the buildup in bad assets in the commercial banks was a banking crisis in 1991 and a
recession (Steigum 2009).
Similar stories occurred in Finland and Sweden (Jonung et al 2009). Their crises and
recessions were much worse than in Norway largely because their currencies were pegged to the
14

DM in the EMS system and they were hard hit by tight German monetary policy in reaction to
the high fiscal costs of German reunification.

III.2.4 Japan in the 1980s

The Japanese boom-bust cycle began in the mid-1980s with a run up of real estate prices fueled
by an increase in bank lending and easy monetary policy. The Bank of Japan began following a
looser monetary policy after the Plaza Accord of 1985, to attempt to devalue the yen and ease the
upward pressure on the dollar. The property price boom in turn led to a stock market boom as the
increased value of property owned by firms raised future profits and hence stock prices
(Iwaisako and Ito 1995). Both rising land prices and stock prices in turn increased firms’
collateral encouraging further bank loans and more fuel for the boom. The bust may have been
triggered by the Bank of Japan’s pursuit of a tight monetary policy in 1989 to stem the asset
market boom.
The subsequent asset price collapse in the next five years led to a collapse in bank
lending with a decline in the collateral backing corporate loans. The decline in asset prices
further impinged on the banking system’s capital, making many banks insolvent. This occurred
because the collapse in asset prices reduced the value of their capital. Lender of last resort policy
prevented a classic banking panic but regulatory forbearance propped up insolvent banks. It took
over a decade to resolve the banking crisis and Japan is still mired in slow growth.

15

III.2.5 House Price Booms of the 1990s and 2000s

The subprime mortgage crisis in the US of 2007-2009 had its origins in a massive house price
boom that began in the 1990s. Its causes include: government policy to encourage housing for a
broad swath of the population, loose monetary policy after the tech boom of 2001 to prevent the
US from slipping into Japan style deflation and “global imbalances” as the newly emerging
countries of Asia invested their growing international reserves in safe US Treasury securities.
The push to encourage housing in the US and other countries goes back to the Great
Depression of the 1930s when the Roosevelt administration set up the Federal Housing Authority
and the GSEs – Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – to encourage the development of the mortgage
market and to provide housing for much of the of the population. In subsequent decades and
especially in the 1990s, as argued by Rajan (2010), successive government administrations and
Congress, as an attempt to reduce rising income inequality and income stagnation, pushed for
affordable housing for low income families using the GSEs and allowed them to reduce their
capital requirements. This led the agencies to take on more risk. Lending was encouraged and
rising prices raised the GSEs profits leading them to take on more risk. The FHA in the 1990s
also took on riskier mortgages, reduced the minimum down payment to 3% and increased the
size of mortgages that would be guaranteed.
The housing boom came to fruition in the George W. Bush administration which urged
the GSEs to increase their holding of mortgages to low income households (Rajan, 2010, p.37).
Between 1999 and 2007 national house prices doubled according to the Standard and Poor’s
Case-Shiller repeat sales index.
16

The private sector also contributed heavily to the boom in an environment of loose
regulation and oversight as they recognized that the GSEs would backstop their lending. During
this period lending standards were relaxed and practices like NINJA and NODOC loans were
condoned, These developments led to the growth of the subprime and Alt A mortgages which
were securitized and bundled into mortgage backed securities and then given triple A ratings.
Mortgage backed securities (MBSs) were further repackaged into collateralized debt obligations
(CDOs). Credit Default swaps (CDSs) provided insurance on many of these new products.
Financial firms ramped up leverage and avoided regulatory oversight and statutory capital
requirements with special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and special investment vehicles (SIVs).
These factors encouraged a lending boom. As emphasized in this paper the boom was
fueled by expansionary monetary policy by the Federal Reserve after the tech boom bust of
2001. Low policy rates were kept in place until 2005 to prevent the economy from slipping into
Japan style inflation. Also, as discussed above, the low interest rate environment of the Great
Moderation also encouraged risky investment. An additional expansionary impulse may have
come from the Asian savings glut (Bernanke (2005)). As China and other countries pegged their
currencies at undervalued rates relative to the dollar to encourage export driven growth, they
accumulated huge international reserves which were invested in safe US Treasury securities.
This imbalance allowed the US to run a persistent current account deficit which provided fuel for
the boom.
Other countries had big housing booms in this period as well. The two most notable,
Spain and Ireland benefited from joining the Euro in 1999. This gave them access to massive
capital flows from the core countries of Europe on the assumption that currency risk had been
17

eliminated and that in the event of a financial crisis and sovereign debt default they would be
bailed out hence reducing country risk. The booms in each case were driven by strong local
fundamentals; in the case of Ireland by the development of a high tech export sector and in the
Spanish case by rapid growth as Spain emerged as an advanced country. In both these cases
loose monetary policy under the ECBs "one size fits" all policy also fueled the boom. Finally the
UK like the US had a housing boom partially promoted by government housing policies,
financial innovation and high leverage and loose Bank of England policy.

III.5 Summary

The wide history of house price booms displays considerable evidence of a connection between
monetary expansion and booms. It also highlights the importance of bank credit expansion.
However the circumstances of the different episodes varied considerably. House price booms on
some occasions reflected real shocks such as rapid immigration and financial liberalization as
well as expansionary monetary policy. In the rest of the paper we provide some empirical
evidence on the contribution of monetary policy, bank credit expansion, low inflation and several
other factors to a large sample of house price booms.

IV. Identifying House Price Booms

Before outlining our econometric approach we first identify asset price booms for real house
prices. Our approach to identifying boom/bust periods is a mixture of the formal and the
informal. We first use a well-known dating algorithm to find turning points of our asset price
series and then use our discretion to select those expansions/contraction pairs that meet our
criteria. We do this to avoid some well-known problems that dating algorithms can have in
identifying cycles when the underlying data is purely random (see for example Cogley and
Nason (1995)).
The first step of the process is to date the turning points of our asset price series. We do
this using the method described in Harding and Pagan (2002) and Pagan and Sossounov (2003).
In these two related papers the authors use the method of Bry and Boschan (1971) to date turning
points of time series. The dating algorithm of Bry and Boschan (1971) was formulated to mimic
the NBER dating process and is successful in dating turning points in time series. For real house
prices we look for peaks (troughs) that are higher (lower) than the two nearest observations on
each side of the turning point under the constraint that peaks and troughs must alternate. Note
however that this is the first stage of our process.
The second stage of our process we do the following: Once turning points are identified
we inspect each expansion (defined as the period from a trough to the next peak) to see if it fits
our definition of an asset price boom. To identify asset price booms we take a “holistic”
19

approach. That is we first look for expansions that meet our criteria and then we visually inspect
each prospective boom to check whether the dates for the boom should be corrected. For
example, starting dates are moved to the point where the gradient of the asset price series first
significantly picks up if the initial periods of the expansion are relatively flat.
The definition of a boom that we use is that a boom is a sustained expansion in asset
prices that ends in a significant correction. The expansion is such that the rate of growth is higher
than what would be considered usual based on previous cycles. For an expansion to meet the
definition of a sustained expansion the expansion must last at least two years and average at least
5% per year for real house prices. This is similar to the criteria used in Bordo and Wheelock
(2009). The second screening that we use is that the price correction that follows the expansion
in prices must be greater than 25% of the expansion in price that occurred during the expansion.
We believe that this definition rules out secular trends where there can be large increases in asset
prices followed by small corrections followed by another large expansion. The booms that we
identify all are followed by significant price corrections which suggest that the price expansion
was not sustainable and hence a boom/bust period.
The identified house prices booms are reported in Table 1. 7We have annual data on real
house prices for 18 countries from 1920 to 2010. 8 The approach we follow is similar to that used
in IMF WEO (2003), Helbling and Terrones (2004), and Bordo and Wheelock (2009). All of

Figures showing the identified house price booms are not reported due to space considerations but are available

20

these studies used monthly data for a smaller set of countries. Only the Bordo and Wheelock
study covered the pre-World War II period.

IV.1 Housing Booms

With the exception of France in the 1930s and the U.S. in the 1920s in Table 1 we did not
identify any house price booms before World War II. In the post-World War II period most
countries had house price booms in the 1970s and 1980s. The literature at the time associated
them with the liberalization of financial markets that occurred after the breakdown of the Bretton
Woods system. Many of the boom-busts were dramatic, especially in Japan, the Scandinavian
countries, Netherlands and Switzerland. The U.S. only experienced mild booms and corrections
in that period. Several dramatic episodes occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In
particular, the U.S. housing boom of 1997-2006 when real prices rose by 79% and fell by 33%
really stands out. There were other significant increases in house prices during the 1990’s and
2000’s, e.g. UK from 1996 to 2007, but these are not included in the list of identified house
booms as the subsequent correction is not large enough to meet our requirement.

V. Empirical Analysis

In this analysis we pool data from 1920 to 2011 from across the 11 countries in our data set to
investigate the impact of loose monetary policy, low inflation and rapid bank credit growth on
asset prices.9 By pooling the data across the twentieth century we are in a sense calculating the
impact each of our control variables have on asset prices averaged across all the boom periods
that we have identified. Low inflation could reflect the credibility for low inflation that occurred
in the 1980s and 1990s and 1920s according to Borio and Lowe (2002) and Eichengreen and
Michener (2004). In this environment, endogenous asset price booms could arise, financed by
easy bank credit, accommodated by the central bank. Loose monetary policy refers to
deliberately expansionary monetary policy (as evidenced in the policy rate being below the
Taylor rule rate) done for example to prevent deflation as in the 2000s or to stimulate recovery
from a recession.
The asset price data that we use in the analysis are real house prices. As a measure of
monetary policy we use the deviation of a short term interest rate from the optimal Taylor rule
rate.1011 The optimal Taylor rule rate is given by the following equation:

9

The countries in our sample are Canada, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway,

Sweden, Switzerland, and the USA. Countries are included in our regressions if data is available.
10

In another related paper (Bordo and Landon Lane 2013), as an alternative measure of monetary policy, we used

deviations of the growth of monetary aggregates from Milton Friedman’s (1960) famous rule. This measure may be
more relevant for earlier episodes when central banks did not use monetary aggregates as their key policy tool.

23

r Taylor   t  r * 0.5  yt  yt*   0.5  t   * 

(1)

where the output gap term is given by the deviation in log real GDP from its long run trend (as
determined by the Hodrick-Prescott filter with a smoothing parameter equal to 100 since the data
are annual time series) and the inflation target is 2%. It should be noted that we do not use policy
rates in this analysis and that we use for all countries a target interest rate ( r * ) of 2% with
coefficients of 0.5 and 0.5 as in Taylor (1993). Thus the optimal Taylor rule rate that we use is a
very rough measure of the optimal policy rate for each country.
The credit variable that we use is the same that is used in by Schularick and Taylor
(2012). This variable is bank credit as measured by total bank loans as a proportion of total GDP.
It should be noted that there is some discrepancy in the literature when it comes to the discussion
of credit growth. Some use a broad measure of credit including data from the formal banking
sector and non-financial institutions. This broad measure of credit is not available for many
countries before recent decades and so to be able to include as many house price booms as
possible in our analysis we use Schularick and Taylor's (2012) long -run series on bank loans as
our measure of credit. One important issue is that in the recent house price booms in the US and
the UK the prevalence of credit supplied by non-bank financial institutions via the shadow

11

Using the short rate rather than the policy rate is done because of data availability issues. Using a short-term

interest rate is likely to understate the looseness of monetary policy and overstate the tightness. Thus our estimated
impact of loose monetary policy on asset prices is likely to be understated.

24

banking system, has played an important role. Because of this we have to be careful in
interpreting the impact of the credit shock in our analysis. Our credit shock does not include
credit innovations originating from the shadow banking system.
The three shocks that we identify in our panel VAR are a monetary policy shock, an
inflation shock and a bank credit growth shock. To do this we include the deviation of the short
term interest rate from the optimal rate, inflation, bank credit and house prices. The deviation of
the short-term interest rate from the optimal Taylor Rule rate is included to control for possible
correlations between “loose” monetary policy and asset booms. The inflation variable is included
to control for possible correlations between low inflation policy and booms and the bank credit
variable is included to determine if loose or “easy” bank credit has a role in asset booms. These
variables are consistent with the Austrian BIS story as well as recent papers by Schularick and
Taylor (2012), Jorda, Schularick and Taylor (2012) and Christiano et al (2010). These are the
three main alternative variables that have been argued to play a role in asset booms and the aim
of this paper is to use data over the whole twentieth century to shed light on their roles.
In order to do this we use a panel vector autoregression (PVAR). The PVAR that we use
is
p

p

j 1

j 1

yit  i  i Dit   Aj yit  j   B j Dit  yit  j   it

(2)

where the dummy variable Dit takes the value of 1 if country i is in an asset boom in period t and
takes a value of 0 otherwise. This specification allows us to have a PVAR specification for
“regular” periods and another specification for “boom” periods. The data is ordered with the

25

interest rate variable first, the inflation variable second, the credit variable third and the house
price variable last. The data vector yit is therefore defined to be


yit   iits  iitTR ,  it ,   l / y it ,  log  pit   ,
where the price vector is real house prices. Finally it is assumed that  it
periods and  it

 0, 2 

(3)

 0, 1 

in regular

during “boom” periods. The PVAR is estimated with country specific

fixed effects but common slope parameters over the panel.
Orthogonalized shocks are identified using the standard triangular ordering and Cholesky
factor. The interpretations of the shocks are as follows: the first shock is a shock to monetary
policy with a negative shock being interpreted as policy is loosening. The second shock is a
shock to inflation that is orthogonal to the monetary policy shock. This shock reflects inflation
pressures and negative shocks for this shock lowers inflation and lessens pressure for the
monetary authority to act. This shock plays the role of the BIS story where low inflation leads to
upward pressure on asset prices because of inaction by the monetary authority. The third shock is
a shock to our measure of bank credit, the ratio of bank loans to GDP, which is orthogonal to the
first two shocks – the monetary policy shock and the low inflation shock. A positive shock to
bank credit is interpreted as an easing of bank credit and a priori you would expect a positive
bank credit shock to have a positive impact on asset prices. The last shock is the “catch-all”
shock for everything not captured by the first three shocks. There is no interpretation for this
shock except that it represents shocks to asset prices that are orthogonal to our monetary policy
shock, our inflation shock and our bank credit shock. Sources of this shock could include
financial innovation shocks, external demand shocks, credit expansion from the shadow banking
system, and “bubble” behavior shocks.

26

We use the estimates from the PVAR to construct orthogonalized impulse response
functions, forecast error variance decompositions and historical decompositions. The first two
represent average effects over the panel while the last – the historical decompositions – are an
attempt to look at individual boom episodes across countries.
The historical decomposition is constructed in the following way. Suppose that  ~  0,  
where  is a positive definite matrix. Let P0 be a lower triangular matrix such that   P0 P0 . That
is, P0 is the Cholesky factor of  . Then the orthogonalized shocks uit are constructed via

uit  P01 it .

(4)

The historical decomposition is a counterfactual series that is constructed using only one of the
estimated structural shocks. For example, to construct the historical decomposition series based
on only the first shock – the monetary policy shock – you would first set
uit   u1it ,0,0,0 

and then set  it  P0uit . The counterfactual residual series,  it , is the set of residuals that would
have been created if there were only monetary policy shocks, in this example.

V.1 Real House Prices

The PVAR given in (2) is estimated with real house prices in the data vector. Using the Schwarz
Bayesian information criterion (SBIC) it was determined that the number of lags to use was 3.
27

The orthogonalized impulse response functions for both the “regular” periods and the “boom”
periods are depicted in Figure 1. During “regular” periods the impact of a one standard deviation
shock to the monetary policy variable – the deviation of the short-term interest rate from the
Taylor rule rate – on real house prices is small. The initial impact is slightly positive and the
impact takes about 7 periods to be negative. This is not what you would expect. The other three
shocks do appear to impact real house prices as expected. The impact of an increase in inflation
is to deflate house prices, the impact of an easing of bank credit is to increase house prices and,
of course, the impact of a positive shock to house prices is indeed positive.

During “boom” periods the impact of the first three shocks is heightened. The magnitudes
of the initial responses are larger and the impact of a tightening of monetary policy is negative
after a short period. This result suggests that the three shocks have more of an impact during
“boom” periods.
In order to check whether the shocks’ impacts are amplified during “boom” periods we
next turn to forecast error variance decompositions. These are reported in Figure 2 with the
variance decomposition for “regular” periods being represented by the solid blue line and the
variance decomposition for the “boom period being represented by the dashed red line. Figure 2

12

The solid blue line in Figure 1 represents the orthogonalized impulse response function during “regular” periods

while the dashed red line in Figure 1 represents the orthogonalized impulse response function during “boom”
periods.

29

shows clearly that during “regular” periods the three competing shocks have little impact on real
house prices compared to the “other” shock. However for boom periods the impact of each of the
three shocks increases with the largest increase for the bank credit shock. Thus it appears that
easy bank credit plays an important role in “boom” periods which reinforces the view of
Schularick and Taylor (2012), Jorda, Schularck and Taylor (2012) and Christiano et al ( 2010).
The impulse response functions and the forecast error decompositions represent average
effects across all periods and countries in the panel. One has to be careful to use the results of
panel estimates for individual countries as the results presented so far may not be appropriate for
individual countries and individual boom periods. In order to check whether the results presented
so far are appropriate for individual cases we now turn to a number of important house price
booms that have been identified in the literature.
The first house price boom we look at is the house price boom that occurred in the United
Kingdom from 1985 to 1989. Congdon (2005) attributes much of this house price boom to loose
monetary policy. The historical decomposition for this episode is reported in Figure 3. Here the

counterfactual series. As you can see, the historical decomposition does accord with the
historical narrative in that the monetary policy shock appears to explain a large part of the rise in
prices during this episode. The bank credit shock, on the other hand, does not explain much of
the increase in house prices.

The next house price boom that we look at is the house price boom in Norway from 1983
to 1986. Steigum (2009) attributes much of this boom to an easing of credit restrictions. The
historical decompositions for this episode can be found in Figure 4. The historical
decompositions agree with the analysis of Steigum (2009) in that the house price series is pretty
much well-explained by the counterfactual series generated with only credit shocks. Another
house price boom from that period occurred in Sweden from 1985 to 1990. The historical
decompositions, shown in Figure 5, in this case do not allow us to make a case for only one
shock being important. It does not appear, however, that credit played a role early in the boom.

decomposition.

Two more important house price booms are the house price boom in Japan in the late
1980’s and the house price boom in the US from 1996 to 2006. The historical decompositions for
these episodes are found in Figure 6 and Figure 7 respectively. For Japan the house price boom
cannot be explained by any one shock – it looks like all four shocks play equal roles.

The more interesting case is the US. The shock that best mimics the actual data is the
“other” shock. The monetary policy shock alone can only predict a small increase in house prices
during this period while the inflation shock appears to do better after 2002. One thing that is
obvious however is that the credit shock predicts that prices should have fallen over this period.
The historical decomposition appears to suggest that the house price boom in the US during the
late 1990’s and early 2000’s was not caused by easy bank credit.

Our interpretation of the result that the “other” shock does the best in predicting the increase in
house prices for this US episode is that the house price boom was mainly caused by financial
innovation shocks or by bubble behavior.
The historical decompositions offer sobering evidence for those who want to use the
panel results to claim that bank credit shocks are important in explaining house price booms.
35

While bank credit shocks are important on average for the important house price booms from the
1980s, 1990s and 2000s it does not appear that easy credit play a significant role in all of them,
and certainly does not appear to play a role in the US house price boom of the later 1990s and
early 2000s.

V.3 Summary

The results shown above show that the predictions of the PVAR does a reasonable job of
matching the historical narratives of a number of important and major house price booms of the
1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Loose monetary policy, through deviations from the Taylor Rule, is an
important factor in a number of individual house price booms that we look at. Thus there is
evidence that asset price booms could be managed with regular monetary policy instruments.
The low inflation – BIS/ Austrian explanation – is also not discounted. The historical
decompositions show for some individual episodes that low inflation shocks contributed to house
price booms. We also find that easy bank credit plays a role. The aggregate results (impulse
response functions and forecast error variance decompositions) suggest that bank credit shocks
played an important role during boom periods but not during “regular” periods. This is in
contrast to the monetary policy and inflation shocks which appear to play a role in all periods
with their role magnified during boom periods.
The last shock is the “other” shock that captures innovations to house prices that cannot
be explained by loose monetary policy, low inflation or easy bank credit. This is the dominant
36

shock on average and in all individual cases. The interpretation we give to this shock is that the
“other” shock is picking up innovation to the financing of houses, changes in underwriting
standards not captured by shocks to loans, and other innovations including “bubble” behavior.
The “other” shock would also pick up financial innovations that come via the shadow banking
system since the credit variable we use only includes loans made from within the formal banking
system.
An interesting result that comes from the individual historical decompositions is that,
while on average it plays an important role, the bank credit shock is not important for the US
house price boom of the 1990s and 2000s. 15 The US house price boom is mainly explained by
“other” shocks and somewhat by the monetary policy and inflation shocks. If there were only
bank credit shocks the evidence is that there would not have been any run-up of house prices at
all. We explore the robustness of this result in the next section.

VI. Robustness Checks and the Role of Bank Credit

In order to check our results with respect to credit and its apparent lack of importance for the US
house boom of the 1990’s/2000’s we performed a number of robustness checks. These are
reported below:

15

We also show in Section VI.3 that the bank credit shock did not play an important role in the house price run-ups

in the UK and Canada during the 1990s and 2000s as well.

37

VI.1 An Alternative Specification for the PVAR

In this robustness check we estimated a slightly different PVAR than the one that we used to get
the results reported above. In the alternative PVAR we replace the first variable – the deviation
of the short rate from the Taylor rule rate – with the change in interest rates. In this alternative
specification we have

yit   iits ,  it ,   l / y it ,  log  pit   .

(5)

The interpretations of the shocks in this specification are different. The first shock is an
interest rate shock of which some component might be due to monetary policy. We cannot
identify the monetary policy shocks from other interest rate shocks however. The second shock
is the inflation shock orthogonal to the interest rate shocks. The third shock is a bank credit
shock once interest rate changes and inflation shocks have been accounted for. Thus the bank
credit shock here represents those innovations to bank credit that are not due to changes in
interest rates or inflation (i.e. not due to changes in both the nominal and the real interest rate).
The impulse response functions are reported in Figure 8 and the forecast error variance
decompositions are reported in Figure 9. The impact of an increase in interest rates is strongly
negative and all other shocks are as what we would expect. The forecast error variance
decompositions remain similar to the previous specification in that the bank credit shock
accounts for about a third of the overall forecast error variance. However the historical
38

decomposition for the US house price boom of the 1990’s is quite different. This is reported in
Figure 10.

Using this specification it appears that about half of the actual rise in house prices can be
attributed to interest rate shocks. Again the credit shock plays no role in this particular house
price boom.
This leads us to believe that the result that bank credit did not play an important role
during the US house price boom of the 1990’s is quite robust.

VI.2 An Alternative Ordering in the PVAR

One criticism that is leveled at orthogonalized VARs is that the results are not generally robust to
the order that the variables appear in the VAR. It might be claimed that the result that credit
plays a small role in the US house price boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s is due to the
specific ordering. In this robustness check we report the historical decomposition for an
alternative ordering where credit is ordered first, followed by the deviation of the interest rate
from the Taylor Rule rate, the first difference of the inflation rate, and the first difference of the
house price respectively.
Figure 11 reports the historical decomposition of the US house price boom of the later
1990’s and early 2000’s under the alternative ordering specification. It is clearly apparent that
the results are quantitatively and qualitatively the same as for the original ordering. We are quite
confident that the result that bank credit did not play an important role in the US house price
boom of the 1990’s is robust to ordering. Note that while not reported here the impulse response

41

functions and the forecast error variance decomposition for this alternative ordering are almost
identical to the ones reported above.

VI.3 Other House Price Booms of the 1990s and 2000s

During our analysis we only included house price booms that had a subsequent correction that
was equivalent to at least 25% of the rise in prices during the boom. This criterion was quite
strict and as a result a number of large house price increases were not treated as booms. Booms
that only had a small correction or had not yet finished were not included in the boom analysis.
There were a number of house price run-ups that started in the 1990s that are nonetheless

42

interesting. Table 2 reports the house price run-ups from the 1990s and 2000s that were not
included in the empirical work above. In this extension these house price run-ups are included
with the identified house price booms reported in Table 1.

When we add these house price run-ups there are some changes in the results. 16 The
impulse response functions are relatively unchanged but the forecast error variance
decompositions are somewhat different.
Figure 12 reports the forecast error variance decomposition with the solid blue line
depicting the FEVD during “regular” periods and the dashed red line depicting the FEVD during
the extended “boom” periods. The important thing to note here is the added influence of the lowinflation shock and the lessoned impact of the bank credit shock. This result is consistent with
the house price booms and/or run-ups of the 1990s and 2000s being influenced by interest rate
and low-inflation shocks rather than credit shocks.

16

Note that we avoid using the word boom in these house price run-ups as the subsequent correction has either no

occurred yet or was small.

To look further into the causes of the individual house price booms we turn again to
historical decompositions. Figure 13 shows the historical decomposition for the 1990s house
price boom in Canada. Just like the results for the US in the 1990s bank credit growth does a
poor job of explaining the house price boom. Figure 14 reports the historical decomposition for
the United Kingdom. Again, just like the case for Canada and the US, the house price boom/runup of the 1990s and 2000s is not an easy credit story. For Canada and the UK there is strong
evidence that loose monetary policy played an important role – much stronger than for the US
where deviations from the Taylor rule did not explain much of the run-up in prices.

Not all booms in Table 2 are like those reported for Canada, the UK and the US. For
France and Italy credit and interest rate shocks play an important role whereas for the
Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, both the credit and interest rate shocks play no role. Thus the
46

result that credit shocks, which on average play an important role, did not necessarily cause the
house price booms of the 1990s and 2000s is retained when we add in the large house price runups from Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, the UK and Sweden. The evidence
suggests that the UK and US house price booms during the 1990s and 2000s were not caused by
credit booms.

VII. Discussion and Conclusion

Using a panel VAR we show that the three main explanations, including loose monetary
policy, for house price booms all have merit. Averaging across all countries and boom periods
the loose monetary policy shock, low inflation shock and easy credit shock all contribute to
house prices and this is magnified during boom periods. There is evidence that loose monetary
policy played an important role in some historical episodes – for example the UK house price
boom of the 1980s and to a lesser extent Sweden and Japan again in the 1980s. The BIS/Austrian
explanation is also not ruled out as there are some episodes where the identified low inflation
shocks did contribute to the run-up of house prices. The same is true for the credit shock
explanation as well.
However there is still room for alternative explanations as the majority of the forecast
error variance is explained by the “other” shock identified from the panel VAR. The “other”
shock is the dominant shock on average and for a majority of individual cases the “other” shock
plays the dominant role in explaining the house price boom (or run-up in some cases). The
47

“other” shock picks up all innovations to house prices that are not explained by deviations of
interest rates from the Taylor rule, inflation shocks or shocks to credit (as measured by total bank
loans). The “other” shock could include interest rate or monetary policy shocks that are not
measured by the deviation of the interest rate from the Taylor Rule, financial innovation not
measured by banks loans, the impact of the shadow banking system on the housing market, or
they could just be picking up bubble behavior in house prices.
One interesting result we found was that while credit shocks played an important role on
average, it did not play a role at all in some of the major house price booms or run-ups of the
1990s and 2000s. In particular for the US, Canada and the UK during this period, the rise in
house prices cannot be explained by innovations to loans from the banking sector. In these
individual cases the historical decomposition suggests that house prices would have remained
stable if only bank credit shocks were present. Two of these countries, the US and the UK, have
significant shadow banking sectors and it could be that financial innovations or easy credit from
the shadow banking system are to blame for the house price booms rather than easy credit
through the formal banking system.
The housing bust of 2006 in the U.S. and the subsequent financial crisis and Great
Recession then led many policy makers to decide that financial stability should be an important
goal of monetary policy along with low inflation (and real macroeconomic stability).This view
emphasized the use of the tools of macroprudential regulation such as countercyclical capital
requirements and liquidity ratios (Kashyap, Rajan and Stein 2008). This case however has in part
been predicated on the assumption that excessive bank credit was at the heart of the recent boom.
The results in this paper cast some doubt on this assumption. The results also cast doubt on the
48

usefulness of using panel estimators in attempting to understand the causes of house price booms
in general.
The results, especially when we look at individual episodes, suggest that there is no
single magic broad spectrum policy prescription for house price booms. The house price booms
that we examined all looked different in terms of their causes. However the evidence that loose
monetary policy (along with low inflation and credit expansion) does contribute significantly to
booms in house prices suggests that this is an important issue for monetary policy makers to
consider. There is evidence that raising interest rates could have prevented the house price runups we saw in the 1990s and 2000s. This subject received considerable attention during the tech
boom of the late 1990s and again during the housing boom of the early 2000s. Economists
argued both for and against using the tools of monetary policy to defuse asset price booms but
little was changed (Bordo and Landon Lane, 2013).
Our evidence on housing price booms, using data going back nearly 100 years for a
number of countries, that expansionary monetary policy is a significant trigger contributes to the
ongoing debate about the optimal conduct of monetary policy.
