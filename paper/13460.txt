ABSTRACT
This research explores social networks and their relationship to access to health care among adult Mexican-Americans.
We use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) linked to data from the 2000 U.S.
Census and other data sources. We analyze multiple measures of access to health care. Measures of
social networks are constructed at the ZCTA level and include percent of the population that is Hispanic,
percent of the population that speaks Spanish, and percent of the population that is foreign-born and
Spanish-speaking. Regressions are stratified by insurance status and social network measures are interacted
with individual-level measures of acculturation. For insured Mexican-American immigrants, living
in an area populated by relatively more Hispanics, more immigrants, or more Spanish-speakers increases
access to care. The social network effects are generally stronger for more recent immigrants compared
to those who are better established. We find no effects of these characteristics of the local population
on access to care for U.S. born Mexican-Americans, suggesting that similarities in race and language
may contribute more to the formation of social ties among individuals who are less acculturated to
the U.S. Among the uninsured, we find evidence suggesting that social networks defined by ethnicity
improve access to care among recent immigrants. A finding particular to the uninsured is the negative
influence of percent of the population that is Hispanic and the percent that is Spanish-speaking on
access to care among U.S. born Mexican-Americans. The results provide evidence that social networks
play an important role in access to health care among Mexican-Americans. The results also suggest
the need for further study using additional measures of social networks, analyzing other racial and
ethnic groups, and exploring social networks defined by characteristics other than race, language and
ethnicity.

Social Networks and Access to Health Care Among Mexican-Americans

1. Introduction

The racial and ethnic composition of neighborhoods appears related to individuals’
access to health care, though the mechanism through which this occurs is unclear (Kirby,
Taliaferro & Zuvekas, 2006). Social networks are one means through which the local
racial and ethnic composition may influence individuals’ use of medical care. Social
networks are the contacts individuals have with other people in a group to which they
belong (however defined), and it is through these contacts that information flows and
norms of behavior are established. In terms of health care, social networks may influence
the transmission of information among people about how and where to use care as well as
calibrate individuals’ ideas about the appropriate use of health services, such as how
much and when to see a primary care physician, seek a mammogram, or visit the
emergency department.

A substantial body of research extending back decades has confronted the estimation of
social network effects in a variety of contexts. Bertrand, Luttmer & Mullainathan (2000)
and Borjas (1995) study the effects of social networks on participation in welfare;
McManus (2002) and Montgomery (1991) analyze social networks and labor market
outcomes; and Moffitt (2001) summarizes the empirical literature on social network
effects of policy interventions, such as the “Moving to Opportunity” program. Other

3

research has addressed the relationship between social networks and health outcomes
such as disease-specific mortality rates and mental well-being (Kawachi, Colditz,
Ascherio, Rimm, Giovannucci, Stampfer & Willett,1996; Kawachi & Berkman, 2001;
Vogt, Mullooly, Ernst, Pope & Hollis, 1992; Glass, Mendes de Leon, Seeman &
Berkman, 1997).

Yet the study of social networks has not permeated health economics and health services
research to the same degree (Malat, 2006). Some exceptions are Aizer and Currie’s
(2004) analysis of how use of publicly-provided prenatal services by pregnant women in
California is influenced by the behavior of other pregnant women in the same zip code,
and two studies that find a relationship between the size of an individual’s social network
and use of preventive care. Suarez, Lloyd, Weiss, Rainbolt & Pulley (1994) document
greater pap smear and mammogram rates among Mexican-American women in Texas
with larger social networks; likewise, Levy-Storms & Wallace (2003) show the
probability of obtaining a mammogram increases with social network size among
Samoan women in Los Angeles. No other studies that we are aware of address social
networks and their association with access to medical care.1 In this paper, we explore the
relationship between social networks and access to medical care among MexicanAmericans in the U.S.

2. Conceptual Background

Defining the Social Network

4

An individual’s social network can be characterized by the social ties that he/she
establishes (how connected a person is to others) and by the “superstructure” of the
network, or the environment in which these connections form (where a more substantial
superstructure facilitates social ties) (Hall & Wellman, 1985). Both social ties and the
superstructure of the network may influence the information transmitted and the
establishment of norms. The breadth and quality of information flowing among
individuals is likely to be primarily determined by the superstructure of the network, and
the extent of transmission to a particular individual is likely to be affected by his/her
social ties.

Social ties have typically been measured with the number, frequency, and closeness of
interactions between an individual and family members, friends, work colleagues, and
community/ religious acquaintances (Suarez et al, 1994; Vogt et al, 1992; Kawachi et al,
1996). Measures of the network superstructure capture environmental characteristics that
lend themselves to connections among individuals. The well-established socicological
principle of “homophily” suggests that contact between similar people occurs at a higher
rate than among dissimilar people (Lazarsfeld & Merton, 1954). McPherson, SmithLovin, & Cook (2001) assert that geographic proximity is one of the most basic sources
of homophily (i.e., people are more likely to have contact with people who live closer to
them because of the costs associated with travel—even despite technological advances
that could ostensibly mitigate the effects of distance), and that race and ethnicity “create
the strongest divides” in the formation of social networks. For example, geographic
proximity is the single most important predictor of how often friends get together

5

(Verbrugge, 1983), and homophily in race and ethnicity has been shown to influence
marital bonds, friendships formed in school, and conversational exchanges (Kalmijn
1998; Marsden 1987, 1988; Shrum, Cheek, & Hunter, 1988; Schneider, Teske, Roch, &
Marschall, 1997). Language is also a potentially important characteristic of the network
superstructure. Alba (1990) finds that people in the U.S. who speak a non-English
language at home interact mainly with others who speak that language. Naturally,
connections may also form through potentially non-local interactions (such as at a place
of work) and age, occupation, religion and other characteristics may also create divides.

Hypotheses

We hypothesize that the strength of social networks among Mexican-Americans is
positively related to access to care. Strong social networks are likely to facilitate the
transmission of information about sources of culturally competent care, such as
physicians or pharmacy clerks who are bilingual, or, given historically high rates of
uninsurance among Mexican-Americans, the availability of providers who offer low-cost
or charity care. Derose (2000), for example, finds that the ability of Latino women to
obtain care depends heavily on the connections that they establish with bilingual friends,
who help them navigate the pathways to care, as well as with bilingual physicians,
pharmacy clerks, and medical office administrative staff.

We further hypothesize that the effects of strong social networks may vary for uninsured
compared to insured Mexican-Americans. For example, information about providers

6

who offer charity or low-cost care may be transmitted more through word of mouth
compared to information about providers in an insurance plan, which is usually readily
available in the plan’s materials. Thus, strong social networks may exert more of a
positive influence on access to care for the uninsured compared to the insured.

3. Data Sources

We use 1996-2002 MEPS household component survey data linked to data from the 2000
US Census, Area Resource File (ARF), Current Population Survey (CPS), Bureau of
Primary Health Care Uniform Data System (BPHC UDS), the Census of Governments,
and the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances.
MEPS is a nationally representative survey with detailed information on health status and
health services utilization. MEPS uses an overlapping panel design in which respondents
are interviewed multiple times over a 30-month period to collect data spanning a twoyear period (Cohen, Monheit, Beauregard, Cohen, Lefkowitz, Potter, & Arnett, 1996/97).
Variables describing the local area were derived from the additional data sources listed
and linked to MEPS based on respondents’ residential zip code.2

Our sample includes adult (aged 18 to 64) Hispanic respondents of Mexican descent
(Mexican-Americans). We limit the sample to a single national origin to remove
potential heterogeneity in the effects of social networks across different subgroups of
Hispanics. We chose Mexican-Americans because they represent the largest fraction of
Hispanics in the U.S.

7

Each observation represents a one-year observation period; individuals can contribute up
to two observations in total. We exclude individuals who were ineligible for all or part of
the calendar year, such as those who died or were institutionalized during the year.
Given the small sample size of Hispanics living in non metropolitan areas, we limit our
analysis to those residing in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), hereafter referred to as
“urban” residents. In total, our data include 14,504 observations from 8,371 respondents.

4. Methods

We use multivariate probit regression models to assess the effects of social network on
dependent variables that measure access to health care. In our models, we control for a
large number of individual and local area characteristics that may influence access to
care. We stratify our analyses by insurance status (insured during the year versus
uninsured for the entire year) to allow for potential differences in the effects of social
networks across these two groups of individuals (as described in Hypotheses).

Dependent Variables

We estimate models for four dependent variables: (1) whether the person has a “usual
source of care,” defined as a health care provider where the person usually goes when
sick or needing health advice; (2) whether or not the person has an office-based physician
or non-physician (e.g., nurse practitioner, podiatrist) visit during a year; (3) whether the

8

individual has any prescription drug expenditures during the year; and (4) whether the
individual has any medical expenditures or charges during the year. All are 0-1
dichotomous variables. The “any expenditure” variable is equal to one if an individual
has any expenditures for inpatient or outpatient care, pharmaceuticals, durable medical
equipment, or other types of care (e.g., home health); in addition, the variable is one if an
individual had no expenditures but had positive charges, which indicates receipt of
charity (free) care.

Social Network Measures

We include measures of the superstructure of the social network, but do not directly
measure social ties. Including measures of social ties in the models is problematic (even
if these measures were available in the MEPS), because they are likely to be endogenous;
that is, unobserved characteristics of individuals that influence the number of social ties
they have may also influence their propensity to seek or use medical care (such as
whether a person is outgoing or introverted). However, because social ties are likely to
be influenced by the network superstructure, our analyses with the superstructure
variables capture both the direct effects of the network superstructure on access to health
care as well as indirect effects that occur through the influence of the superstructure on
social ties. From an econometric perspective, our regression models are thus reduced
forms.

9

We have no measures of the use of health care by individuals in the network (which, if
available, would conceivably capture local care-seeking norms). However, the inclusion
of these variables would result in the so-called “reflection” problem, which results in
biased estimates of network effects (Manski, 1993; Moffitt, 2001). As an alternative,
Moffitt (2001) suggests identifying network effects by modeling the effects of exogenous
group characteristics on individuals’ behavior (as we do), although this type of analysis
does not allow for distinguishing the specific mechanism through which the network
effects operate.

Following the Conceptual Background, key measures of the superstructure of an
individual’s social network are the demographic and linguistic characteristics of the local
(geographically proximate) population. We construct three alternative social network
measures and include each measure in a separate regression. We construct the network
measures based on respondents’ ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) of residence.3 We
use ZCTA because it is the lowest level of geography at which we were able to link
network measures to individuals.

The first social network measure is based on ethnicity. We include a variable indicating
the percentage of the population in the respondent’s ZCTA that is Hispanic.4 The second
social network measure is based on both language and nativity and is the percentage of
the local population that is foreign-born and Spanish-speaking. The language restriction
is meant to capture the immigrant Hispanic population, since information on number of
immigrants by country of origin was unavailable. Language alone forms the basis of the

10

third social network measure. We include an indicator of the percentage of the
population in the respondent’s ZCTA that is Spanish speaking (which is defined as the
percentage of individuals who report speaking Spanish at home).

We allow for variability in the effect of social networks on access among MexicanAmericans of varying degrees of acculturation. The local Hispanic/Spanishspeaking/immigrant population may more profoundly affect the formation of social
networks individuals who are less acculturated to the U.S. compared to others. We
interact each social network measure with an individual-level variable indicating whether
the individual was born in the U.S., is foreign-born but has lived in the U.S. for more than
five years, or is foreign-born and a recent immigrant.

Individual-Level Explanatory Variables

At the individual level, we control for socio-demographic characteristics, insurance
status, and health status. Socio-demographic controls include education, household
structure, gender, age, gender-age interactions, family income as a percent of the poverty
line, language of interview (English or Spanish),5 and acculturation. We interpret
language of interview as an indicator of an individual’s primary language. The
acculturation variables are U.S. born (omitted), foreign-born and lived in the U.S. for
more than 5 years, and foreign-born and lived in the U.S for less than 5 years.6

11

We measure health status with a comprehensive set of variables spanning four domains:
(1) functional, cognitive, and social limitations (a single indicator for any such
limitation); (2) vision/hearing problems (single indicator for any such problem, including
blindness or deafness); (3) self-rated health, categorized as excellent, very good, good,
fair, or poor (an indicator variable for each category); and (4) indicators for chronic
conditions. We assessed the presence of 25 chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity,
asthma) and included specific indicator variables for the most frequent conditions as well
as a summary indicator for any of the remaining conditions.

For the regressions using the sample of insured individuals, we include an indicator for
whether insurance was public or private. All models also included indicator variables for
the year of the MEPS data.

Other ZCTA-Level Explanatory Variables

We include indicators of attributes of the local area that may independently influence
access to care: percentage of the population that is black (non Hispanic), percentage that
is of another racial minority (non-Hispanic), median family income, population density
and the percentage of individuals who are uninsured in each MSA. The last measure is
based on a three-year moving average derived from CPS data.

We also include measures of the local health care supply. We include county-level
measures of the number of primary care doctors (family practitioners, internists, and

12

general practitioners) and the number of hospital beds per thousand people in the county,
obtained from the ARF. To capture within county variation in physician supply, we
include ZCTA-level variables that measure socio-demographic characteristics that are
likely to be correlated with physician location: percent educated at a high school level or
beyond and percent of households with income less than the federal poverty line (FPL).
We expect relatively high concentrations of low income and less-educated populations to
be associated with a smaller local physician supply. Finally, we include two measures of
the availability of safety net care for the uninsured. The first is based on BPHC UDS data
and captures the number of federally-funded migrant health centers, community health
centers, or public housing primary care programs within a five mile radius from the
population centroid of the respondent’s zip code. The second is the level of local
expenditures for health and hospitals based on data from the Census of Governments and
the Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances as a measure of the financial
status and general capacity of local safety net providers (Long & Marquis 1999; Marquis,
Rogowski & Escarce 2004). Expenditures were converted to 2000 dollars using the
medical component of the consumer price index and scaled to the low-income population
(within 200 percent of the poverty line) in the MSA using data from the March CPS.

Estimation

We use a probit model for analyses of each of the four dependent variables. All
regressions were weighted and adjusted for the complex design of the MEPS survey

13

(Cohen et al. 1996/1997; Cohen, DiGaetano, & Goksel 1999). We stratify all regressions
by insurance status (insured versus uninsured).

5. Results

Tables 1, 2 and 3 provide descriptive statistics for the dependent and explanatory
variables in the analyses.

Tables 4 and 5 present partial regression results for insured and uninsured MexicanAmericans, respectively. Each regression model includes the full set of individual-level
explanatory variables listed in Table 3. However, Tables 4 and 5 show results only for
the various social network measures and for the individual-level variables measuring
primary language, nativity, and years in the U.S., which are interacted with the social
network variables. We report the change in the probability of the dependent variable for a
marginal change in the explanatory variable.

In these tables, specification (1) uses the ethnicity-based social network measure (percent
of the ZCTA population that is Hispanic); specification (2) uses the social network
measure based on nativity and language; and specification (3) uses the language-based
social network measure. Each of the social network measures is interacted with the
individual-level variables measuring acculturation (US born, foreign-born and lived in
the U.S. less than 5 years, foreign-born and lived in the U.S. more than 5 years). We

14

begin with discussion of results for Mexican-Americans with insurance and then turn to
the uninsured.

Social Networks and Access to Care Among Insured Mexican-Americans (Table 4)

Consistent with previous studies, we find that insured Mexican-Americans whose
primary language is Spanish are less likely to have a usual source of care, an office visit,
or any medical care expenditures compared to those whose primary language is English.
Similarly, foreign-born Mexican-Americans, and particularly those who have lived in the
U.S. for a short period of time, are less likely to have a usual source of care, an officevisit, and any medical expenditures compared to U.S.-born Mexican-Americans.

Turning to network effects (Specification 1), a higher percentage of Hispanics in the
ZCTA leads to higher probabilities of having a usual source of care and any prescription
drug expenditures among immigrants who have lived in the country more than 5 years,
and, among more recent immigrants, higher probabilities of any medical care
expenditures and any prescription drug expenditures. The effects of the social network
on nearly every measure of access to care is significantly greater among immigrants than
among the U.S. born (χ2= 4.4 for usual source of care, χ2=5.2 for any office visit, and
χ2=3.6 for any medical expenditure).

We also find that the effects of nativity-based networks differ across individuals
depending on where they were born (Specification 2). A higher percentage of the local

15

population that is foreign-born increases the probability of having any medical
expenditures among recent immigrants and any prescription expenditures among
established immigrants. Further, the effect of living in an area with a greater
concentration of immigrants is statistically greater among immigrants compared to nonimmigrants for the probabilities of having a usual source of care (χ2=6.4), any office visit,
(χ2=3.2), and any medical expenditure (χ2=2.8).

We find a significant positive effect of the percentage of the population who speak
Spanish on access to care among both recent and established immigrants, with a higher
probability of having any medical expenditures or any prescription drug expenditures
among the former and a higher probability of having a usual source of care or any
prescription drug expenditures among the latter (Specification 3). The effect of living in
an area with more Spanish speakers is statistically greater for immigrants compared to
non-immigrants for both the probability of having a usual source of care (χ2=4.7) and the
probability of having an office-based visit (χ2=4.6 for U.S. natives versus recent
immigrants; χ2=3.9 for U.S. born versus established immigrants). In addition, the point
estimate of the magnitude of the social network effect on access is consistently larger for
newer compared to less recent immigrants.

In sensitivity analyses, we tested for a main effect of each social network measure,
without interacting it with the variables measuring acculturation (nativity and length of
time in the U.S.). We found positive and statistically significant effects of each of the
social network measures. For both the percentage of the population that is Hispanic and

16

the percentage of the population that is Spanish speaking, these social network measure
positively affect the probability of having any prescription expenditures and any medical
expenditures. The percentage of the population that is foreign-born and Spanish speaking
positively affects the probability of any prescription expenditures.

Social Networks and Access to Care Among Uninsured Mexican-Americans (Table 5)

For uninsured Mexican-Americans, being primarily a Spanish-speaker has negative
effects on access to care as measured by the probability of having a usual source of care,
and the probability of having any prescription drug expenditures. We again find more
limited access to care among recent immigrants compared to U.S. born MexicanAmericans.

Among the uninsured, living in areas populated by Hispanics, Spanish-speakers, or
Spanish-speaking immigrants has a deleterious effect on access to care among nativeborn Mexican-Americans. More specifically, we find that for the US born, living in an
area with a relatively greater population of Hispanics, Spanish-speakers, or immigrants
has a negative effect on the probability of having an office visit. The percentage of
immigrants in the local area also has a negative effect on the probability of having any
medical expenditures among the U.S. born.

17

Echoing the findings for the U.S. born, we find the percentage of the population that is
foreign-born reduces the probability of having a usual source of care among immigrants
who have lived in the country for more than five years.

By contrast, we find a positive effect of living in an area with more Hispanics or more
Spanish-speakers on the probability of having any medical expenditures among recent
immigrants who are uninsured.

In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded the interactions between the social network
measures and the individual-level acculturation variables. We found negative and
statistically significant effects of each of the measures (percentage of the population that
is Hispanic, Spanish-speaking, and foreign-born) on the probability of having a usual
source of care.

6. Discussion

For insured Mexican-Americans, the results are consistent across the range of
specifications and measures of access. For Mexican-American immigrants, living in an
area populated by relatively more Hispanics, more immigrants, or more Spanish-speakers
increases access to care, probably by facilitating the flow of information among people in
the local area about where to go for care—or for culturally competent care, more
specifically—and what processes to use to get there. The social network effects are

18

generally stronger for more recent immigrants compared to those who are better
established.

We find no effects of these characteristics of the local population on access to care for
U.S. born Mexican-Americans. The finding is natural for the percentage of the local
population that is foreign-born, which is only likely to facilitate social networks among
individuals who are themselves foreign-born. With regard to the other social network
measures, the null findings for the native born Mexican-Americans are consistent with
our hypothesis that similarities in race and language may contribute more to the
formation of social ties among individuals who are less acculturated to the U.S.

The results for the uninsured further support the notion that social networks may facilitate
access to care. We find evidence suggesting that the percentage of the population that is
Hispanic fosters social network formation among uninsured Mexican-Americans who are
recent immigrants, thereby increasing access to care.

We further find that for uninsured Mexican-Americans who are U.S. born or who have
lived in the U.S. for a relatively long period of time, living in areas more heavily
populated with immigrants is negatively associated with access to care. These findings
are consistent with our hypotheses about social networks and access to care, as the
percentage of immigrants is likely to foster bonds primarily among individuals who are
themselves immigrants and particularly among those who are more recent immigrants.
Compared to the positive effects of the percentage of immigrants in the area on access

19

among recent immigrants, we find the logical converse among the U.S. born: the absence
of social networks (because in areas with more immigrants there are fewer U.S. born) has
negative effects on access.

One of our a priori expectations was that social networks may be more important for the
uninsured compared to the insured because of the importance of word-of-mouth
communication about providers who will accommodate those limited ability to pay. The
evidence suggests this may be the case. Although we find more positive and statistically
significant findings for insured immigrants compared to uninsured immigrants, power is
more of an issue for the uninsured because the sample size is considerably smaller. The
results for U.S. born Mexican-Americans are more revealing. As described, for the U.S.
born uninsured, the absence of social networks has a negative effect on access to care.
By comparison, we did not find a negative effect (the effect was not statistically different
from zero) of the absence of social networks defined by nativity on access among the
U.S. born insured, which suggests that the insured may be protected to some degree
against the deleterious effects of the absence of social networks.

A finding particular to the uninsured is the negative influence of percent of the
population that is Hispanic and the percent that is Spanish-speaking on access to care
among U.S. born Mexican-Americans—factors that we hypothesized would contribute
positively to the formation of social networks. One possible explanation is that these
population characteristics, rather than aiding in the development of bonds, actually inhibit
their formation among the U.S. born. U.S. born Mexican-Americans more strongly

20

affiliate with non-Hispanics or non Spanish-speakers, by virtue of having lived in the US
their entire lives. For these individuals, it is possible that social networks may be more
strongly related to other characteristics (such as occupation or religious participation).

Our study has several limitations. Selection is a potential problem, because people may
locate in neighborhoods based on attributes that may themselves be related to access to
care. For example, Mexican-Americans who are more distrustful or fearful of U.S.
society may choose to live in areas with more ethnically or linguistically similar
individuals, and that same distrust and fear may prevent them from seeking health care.
In addition, despite our relatively comprehensive set of explanatory variables,
unmeasured characteristics of local areas may be correlated with both access to care and
our network measures, leading to biased estimates of network effects. The most
worrisome unmeasured variable in this regard is the local supply of Spanish-speaking
physicians. Finally, it is possible that there are mechanisms other than social networks
through which the local racial, ethnic, and linguistic composition influence access to care,
although specific competing mechanisms, if they exist, have not been well-articulated.

Nevertheless, the results provide evidence that social networks play an important role in
access to health care among Mexican-Americans. The results also suggest the need for
further study using additional measures of social networks (for instance, measured at
more or less localized geographic levels), analyzing other racial and ethnic groups, and
exploring social networks defined by characteristics other than ethnicity, language, and
nativity.

ENDNOTES
1

Other studies have explored the effect of social capital on health and access to health

care (e.g., Lynch, Due, Muntaner & Smith, 2000; Prentice, 2005), but the concept of
social capital is distinct from that of social networks. Social capital often refers to the
level of trust and reciprocity in the community and may influence access to care by
affecting individuals’ trust in community physicians, psychosocial well-being (and
consequently individuals inclination to obtain care), and/or functional support (e.g. a
neighbors willingness to provide childcare during a medical appointment). By
comparison, social networks capture the role of information and norms on access to care.

2

No geographic identifiers other than region and MSA are available on the public use

MEPS. Social and Scientific Systems (SSS), operating through a contract with the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), linked local area characteristics to
individual respondents and the resulting data file, stripped of geographic identifiers, was
available for our use on-site at the AHRQ Data Center.

3

ZCTAs were developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Census 2000. They are

generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service ZIP Code service areas. In many
cases, ZCTA and zip code are the same.
4

Ideally, we would be able to capture the percentage of the population that is of Mexican

origin, but this measure was unavailable at the population level.

27

5

The only variable available for measuring individual-level language is language in

which the MEPS interview was completed. We create a variable that is zero if the MEPS
interview was completely in English and positive if the interview was wholly or partly in
Spanish. A limitation is that this measure does not allow us to distinguish bilingual from
monolingual individuals.

6

We include dummy variables for observations missing either years in the U.S. or

nativity.
