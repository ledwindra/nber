CEO Pay and Firm Size: an Update after the Crisis
Xavier Gabaix, Augustin Landier, and Julien Sauvagnat
NBER Working Paper No. 19078
May 2013
JEL No. G3,J2
ABSTRACT
In the "size of stakes" view quantitatively formalized in Gabaix and Landier (2008), CEO compensation
is determined in a competitive talent market, and reflects the size of firms affected by talent. This paper
offers an empirical update on this view. The years 2004-2011, which include the recent crisis, were
not part of the initial study and offer a laboratory to examine the theory as they include new positive
and negative shocks to the size of large firms. Executive compensation at the top (ex ante) did closely
track the evolution of average firm value during those years. During the crisis (2007 - 2009), average
total firm value decreased by 17%, and CEO pay decreased by 28%. During 2009-2011, we observe
a rebound of firm value by 19% and of CEO pay increased by 22%. These fairly proportional changes
provide a validity check in favor of the "size of stakes" view.

Introduction

Executive compensation remains very much at the center-stage of academic and policy debates.
A relative lack of consensus seems to prevail regarding the origins of the large rise of executive
compensation observed in the US since the 70s. According to some scholars (see e.g. Bebchuck and
Fried (2004) for a summary of this view), rising compensation is due to a higher ability of CEOs to
extract rents from shareholders, e.g. by capturing their board (Shivdasani and Yermack (1999)) or
appointing compensation consultants that cater to their interests (Murphy and Sandino (2008)).
Hermalin (2005) argues instead that the rise in CEO pay reflects tighter corporate governance:
pay increases to compensate CEOs for the greater risk of being fired. Others argue that the very
function of CEOs has changed over time: they are now more often poached from outside firms
than before (Murphy and Zabojnik (2004) and Frydman (2005)); shareholders have become more
convinced of the importance of financial incentives (Jensen et al. (2004)). By contrast, Gabaix and
Landier (2008, henceforth GL) argue that the bulk of variations in CEO compensation across time
and across companies can be explained as the result of competitive market forces. They show that
under fairly general assumptions, in a market where the impact of CEO talent is scaled linearly
by firm size, and where matching CEOs with firms is frictionless (as in Sattinger 1993 and Tervio
2008), one should expect the compensation of CEOs to follow the following formula:

w(n) = DS(n∗ )β/α S(n)1−β/α

(1)

where w(n) is the dollar compensation of the CEO of the nth biggest firm by decreasing size, n∗
denotes the index of the reference firm (e.g. the 250th largest firm); α is given by the distribution
of firm size at the top: S(n) = An−α ; and β depends on the distribution of talent at the top. GL
calibrate β/α ' 2/3. In particular, this formula predicts that if all firm sizes rise (resp. decline)
over time by a factor x, compensation should rise (resp. decline) by that same factor. We call
the theory of managerial pay proposed by GL the “size of stakes”view, because it implies that as
the size of large firms has increased over time, executive compensation has increased by a similar
factor, as all firms have a higher willingness to pay for talent. GL, using data from 1970-2003,
provide evidence consistent with the size of stakes view.
In this paper, we examine whether the size of stakes view of executive compensation, proposed
2

by GL, passes the test of time.1 The years 2004-2011, which include the great recession, were
not part of the initial study and provide the opportunity to run an informative “out-of-sample”
assessment of the theory. During the financial crisis, the market capitalization of large companies
was strongly negatively impacted. Between 2007 and 2009, the average firm market total value
of the largest 500 US firms decreased by 17.4%, which represents the largest two-year drop over
the last forty years. This offers an exceptional laboratory to potentially reject the size of stakes
view, which predicts that changes in average CEO compensation in the largest firms should follow
the changes in the average size of these firms. In line with the theory, we do find that executive
compensation at the top did closely track the evolution of average firm value during those years.
The recent data thus tend to be supportive of the equilibrium model developed in GL; the estimates
that we find for β/α are very close to those of our original study and we confirm the constant linear
scaling of talent impact with size. Note that what is particularly non-trivial is the one-to-one
relationship between firm size and CEO pay.
Our focus on the years 2004-2011 is also motivated by a number of recent developments that
affected CEO pay practices, potentially “distorting” the economic link between CEO pay and firm
size identified in GL.2 In 2004, the end of “free” accounting for stock options has been followed by
a shift toward restricted stock and then, toward the use of performance-based vesting conditions
in equity grants (see Bizjak et al. 2013). In 2006, the SEC promulgated new executive pay disclosure rules. Those rules required the disclosure of compensation consultants, which has potentially
affected the incentives of a key player in the pay-setting process (Murphy and Sandino, 2010; Cadman et al. 2010). They also required the disclosure of peers used for benchmarking compensation,
another key driver of pay levels (Faulkender and Yang 2012, Albuquerque et al. forth and Bizjak,
Lemmon and Nguyen 2011). Moreover, after the Enron-type scandals and the burst of the dotcom
bubble, there has been a “change in sentiment” over the usefulness of option-based pay – also related
to the option backdating scandal – and an increase in compensation-related shareholder activism
through shareholder proposals and vote-no campaigns against compensation committee members
(Ertimur, Ferri and Muslu 2011). As a result of the above activism, the mandatory adoption of
“say on pay” in 2011 leads firms to change their pay practices both before and after the vote, in

estimate of its predictive power.

an attempt to obtain a favorable voting outcome (Ertimur, Ferri and Oesch, 2013 and Larcker et
al. 2012). Finally, incentive pay has been viewed as a potential reason for the excessive risk-taking
underlying the financial crisis.
To evaluate the theory, we update the two compensation indices used in GL: between 1980
and 2011, the Jensen - Murphy - Wruck (JMW) compensation index increased by 569% while the
Frydman - Saks (FS) compensation index increased by 341% (here, as everywhere in this article,
increases are in real, inflation-adjusted quantities). By taking the average, we obtain a rise in
CEO pay of 405%. In the same period, the average firm market value of the largest 500 US firms
increased by 425% while the average equity value of the largest 500 US firms (in terms of equity
value) increased by 467%. Thus the evidence supports the broadly proportional evolution of pay
and firm size in the period 1980-2011.
Interestingly, over the recent period 2004 - 2011, firm size successively sharply dropped and
then rebounded. This offers a fairly strong test for the size of stakes view. According to this
view, proportional changes in compensation should be observed as markets drop and rebound. We
find that movements in CEO compensation did indeed closely track movements in firm size: over
2007-2009, average total firm values decreased by 17.4%, equity values by 37.9%, and compensation
indices by 27.7%. During 2009-2011, we observe a rebound of firm values by 19%, equity values by
27%, and compensation indices by 22%.
We want to highlight that the size of stakes view does not hinge on the fact that stock-markets
are perfectly efficient. Even if market values were a poor proxy for fundamental values of firms,
the market view developed in GL still applies; it states that the market for talents and the market
for assets are deeply intertwined. If shareholders overvalue asset prices, it is a natural market
outcome that talent be overvalued by the same factor (this is because in a frictionless framework,
shareholders, who are the owners of assets, also have control over hiring decisions). If they overvalue
assets, they will exhibit a higher than normal willingness to pay for talent.
It is difficult to assess whether the recent years, that are the focus of the present study, are
compatible with the “rent-extraction view” of compensation. Indeed without a specific form for
the “stealing technology” used by managers, it is not possible to predict how rents should vary
over time. If one believes that the “outrage constraint” faced by managers is tighter in downturns
(see Bebchuk and Grinstein (2005)), then one should expect rents to fall as aggregate market
4

performance is negative, but it is hard to know by what factor. By contrast, our prediction that
pay in the largest firms should change over time in the same proportions as the size of large firms
is easy to reject.
Our results are very much in line with Kaplan (2012), who documents that the ratio of average
CEO pay to average firm market capitalization has been constant over time since 1960. Kaplan
(2012) uses market capitalization whereas our benchmark approach uses total firm value (i.e. debt
plus equity market value). We revisit whether total firm value is a better proxy for firm size
in our theory than other measures of size such as market capitalization or sales. Total firm value
(debt+equity) yields estimates that are theoretically more appealing (as it is independent of leverage
choice), but pure equity has a good explanatory power, especially for short-term movements (see
Figure 1). Perhaps firms that are riskier and that have more upside potential choose to have less
debt (to avoid bankruptcy costs). Then, equity is likely to be a better proxy than debt+equity for
how much a CEO can impact the firm.

Data Description

We incorporate the recent period in the regressions and graphs presented in GL. For this, we
follow the methodology of GL. However, there are two noteworthy differences. First, we restrict
our attention to US-based firms. The original study took all firms in Compustat. However, since
Compustat has been including many more foreign firms, an additional filtering is in order. Second,
the procedure followed to construct total firm value in GL unwittingly excluded some banks because
the item Deferred Taxes is often missing in Compustat for these firms.3 As shown below, we thus
set deferred taxes to 0 when missing before computing total firm value. As a novelty with respect
to GL, prompted by interesting results in Kaplan (2012), we introduce equity market value as an
alternative measure of firm size. We first describe in details the data, and then present the results.

2.1

Datasets

We use two datasets. Execucomp provides us with data on CEO compensation. Regressions
presented in this paper were performed with Execucomp data extracted from WRDS in September
3
This effect was noted by Nagel (2010). We obtain very similar results in what follows when Deferred Taxes are
excluded from the computation of total firm value.

5

2012. We use Compustat to retrieve information on the size of US-based firms. US-based companies
are identified with Compustat variable FIC.
CEO Compensation. The Execucomp panel provides data on compensation of the five best
paid executives of the largest US firms from 1992. We identify the CEO of each firm-year in
Execucomp with the dummy variable CEOANN. However, using the CEOANN variable, some
firm-year observations have no CEO in Execucomp. We are however able in some cases to infer
the CEO’s identity from the BECAMECEO variable indicating the date at which the individual
became CEO. Specifically, when the CEOANN variable indicates no CEOs for a given firm-year,
we consider an executive as the CEO of the firm in year t when (i) the BECAMECEO variable
indicates that the executive was appointed as the CEO in year t or before and (ii) the dummy
variable CEOANN indicates the executive as the CEO of the firm in year t + 1 or after.
CEO compensation is then measured with Execucomp variable, TDC1, which includes salary,
bonus, restricted stock granted and the Black-Scholes value of stock-options granted. Finally, CEO
compensation is converted into 2000 constant dollars using the GDP deflator of the Bureau of
Economic Analysis.
Firm size. We will use different proxies for firm size, namely total firm value, earnings before
interest and taxes, sales and equity value. We construct these variables from Compustat. Total
firm value is the sum of the market value of equity, defined as number of shares outstanding (item
CSHO) multiplied by the end-of-fiscal-year stock price (item PRCC F), and the book value of
debt, defined as total assets (item AT) minus the sum of book value of equity (item CEQ) and
deferred taxes (item TXDB); we set deferred taxes to 0 when missing. Earnings before interest and
taxes is (item OIBDP-item DP). Sales is measured with Compustat item SALE. Equity value is
(item CSHO*item PRCC F). All quantities are converted into 2000 constant dollars using the GDP
deflator of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Finally, we construct the 48 Fama-French industry
dummies from the conversion table in the Appendix of Fama and French (1997) using the firm’s 4
digit SIC industry code.

2.2

Compensation indices

To evaluate changes in CEO pay over the long run, we rely on the same compensation indices used
in GL, namely the JMW and FS compensation indices.
The FS compensation index is based on Frydman and Saks (2010). Total Compensation is
the sum of salaries, bonuses, long-term incentive payments, and the Black-Scholes value of options
granted. The data are based on the three highest-paid officers in the largest 50 firms in 1940, 1960,
and 1990. The data appendix in Frydman and Saks (2010) provides detailed information on the
sample selection.
The JMW Compensation Index is based on the data of Jensen, Murphy, and Wruck (2004).
Their sample encompasses all CEOs included in the S&P 500, using data from Forbes and ExecuComp. CEO total pay includes cash pay, restricted stock, payouts from long-term pay programs,
and the value of stock options granted from 1992 onward using ExecuComp’s modified Black-Scholes
approach. Compensation prior to 1978 excludes option grants and is computed between 1978 and
1991 using the amounts realized from exercising stock options.
Reproducing Figure 1 and Table III of GL for the period 1970 - 2011 requires extending both
compensation indices over the recent period, i.e. 2004 - 2011. We proceed in the following way :
for every year between 2005 and 2011, the FS compensation index (respectively, the JMW compensation index) in year t equals the FS compensation index (respectively, the JMW compensation
index) in year t − 1 times the annual percentage increase in the mean CEO compensation of the
largest 500 US-based firms.
Specifically, we first rank for every fiscal year between 2005 and 2011 US-based companies in
terms of total firm value, computed at the end of the previous fiscal year. For every year between
2005 and 2011, we then merge Compustat and Execucomp with the GVKEY identifier and keep
the largest 500 US companies for which we can retrieve CEO compensation in Execucomp. We
use the procedure mentioned above to identify CEOs in Execucomp. Before computing the annual
percentage increase in the mean CEO compensation, we deflate it using the Bureau of Economic
Analysis GDP Deflator.
Figure 1 compares the evolution of CEO pay and firm size over the period 1970-2011. We
again restrict our attention to firms with non-missing information on CEO pay in Execucomp
7

when computing the average market total value of the largest 500 US-based firms between 1992
and 2011. Before 1992 (the earliest date for the Execucomp database), we simply compute the
average market total value of the largest 500 US-based firms present in Compustat. Finally, using
a symmetric procedure, we compute the average equity value of the largest 500 US-based firms in
terms of equity value. After 1992, as above, we again exclude firms for which Execucomp does not
provide information on CEO compensation.
Figure 2 plots the firm size distribution confirming a fat-tailed distribution of firms, consistent
with a Zipf’s law for firm size (Simon 1955, Axtell 2001, Gabaix 1999, Luttmer 2007), here firm
size being firm total market value rather than the usual “size” expressed by number of employees.

CEO Pay and Proxies For Firm Size

As in GL, we first consider three proxies for firm size - namely total firm value, earnings before
interest and taxes (EBIT) and sales. We then regress the logarithms of CEO compensation of
the largest 1000 US-based companies in terms of firm value on the logarithms of the different size
proxies, controlling for year and industry.4

[Table 1 here]
In the GL model, the most relevant measure for size depends on the nature of the CEO’s job. If
the impact of the talent of the CEO hired for year t is to induce a temporary shock on productivity
(e.g. via leadership) or sales (e.g. via better marketing), then size can be measured by sales or
earnings during that year. However, if one believes that the impact of the CEO hired at time t is
long-lasting and affects all future profits, then, the relevant measure of size is the net present value
of future profits, i.e. firm total market value (i.e. the value of its debt and its equity). This view is
coherent if one believes that an important role of the CEO is to take strategic decisions that affect
the future growth path of the firm, to implement technological (or organizational) innovations that
4

Note that the selection criterion is not the same as in GL, where CEO compensation of the 1000 highest paid
CEOs is regressed on the size proxies each year. Running the regression for the largest 1000 US firms is motivated
by the fact that in GL theory, firm size is a more exogenous object than CEO pay.

push the firm’s product line (or productivity) to a new level (and thus affect all future generations of
products (resp. profits)). Such view of the CEO’s job could be for instance formalized in a vertical
quality ladder model of innovation à la Aghion-Howitt, in which a new innovation permanently
impacts productivity. In addition, the full firm value is a measure of size that is neutral to the
choice of capital structure: the impact of a CEO should not depend directly on whether the firm is
financed with debt or equity. We include results with equity value as a proxy of size because it is a
popular measure of firm size – it is used notably by Kaplan (2012). A possible rationale for using
equity value, rather than full firm value (equity + debt) may be as follows. It involves a theory of
the capital structure; debt largely reflects the “safe” assets of the firm, whose value the CEO does
not directly affect – because those safe assets back debt, while equity reflects the “risky assets”,
which the CEO does affect.
Table 1 presents the results. The three size proxies have positive and significant coefficients
when used together to predict compensation (column (1)). Moreover, as shown in columns (2) to
(4), total market value, EBIT and sales have similar predictive power when used alone to predict
compensation, as can be seen by comparing R2 , with a slight edge for firm value. In column (5),
we introduce equity value as an alternative measure of firm size. Again, equity value turns out to
be a valid proxy for firm size.

3.2

Panel Evidence, 1992 - 2011

As in GL, we estimate:

ln(wi,t ) = d + e × ln(Sn∗ ,t−1 ) + f × ln(Si,t−1 )

(2)

where wi,t is CEO compensation in firm i and year t, Sn∗ =250,t−1 is market total value of the firm
number n∗ = 250 in the sample at the end of fiscal year t − 1 and Si,t−1 is firm i total market value.
We cluster standard errors at either the firm level or at the year level. The sample consists of either
the top 500 or top 1000 US-based companies in terms of firm value for which we can retrieve CEO
compensation in Execucomp (using the procedure mentioned above). The sample period is from
1992 to 2011.

9

[Table 2 here]

Columns (1) to (3) (respectively columns (4) to (6)) in Table 2 present the results for the
largest 1000 (respectively 500) US firms. Columns (2) and (4) include industry fixed effects while
columns (3) and (6) include firm fixed effects. The results obtained over the sample period 1992
- 2011 remain consistent with the size of stakes theory. For all specifications, the coefficients (and
standard errors) are similar to those in GL. Moreover, p values for the null hypothesis that e+f = 1
are above 0.1 in specifications (1), (2) and (5), which is consistent with the constant returns to
scale hypothesis in firm size.

[Table 3 here]

Then, we reestimate equation 2 using equity value as an alternative proxy for size. Specifically,
wi,t is CEO compensation in firm i and year t, Sn∗ =250,t−1 is market equity value of the firm number
n∗ = 250 (in terms of market equity value) in the sample at the end of fiscal year t − 1 and Si,t−1
is firm i market equity value. Taken together, regression results presented in Table 3 are also
consistent with the constant returns to scale hypothesis in firm size.

3.3

Times-Series US Evidence, 1971 - 2011

Figure 1 shows the evolution of CEO pay and firm size for the largest US-based firms between 1971
and 2011.

[Figure 1 here]
Between 1980 and 2011, the JMW compensation index has increased by 569% while the FS
compensation index has increased by 341%. By taking the average, we obtain a rise in CEO pay of
405%. In the same period, the average firm market value of the largest 500 US firms has increased
by 425% while the average equity value of the largest 500 US firms (in terms of equity value) has

10

increased by 467%. Thus the evidence supports the broadly proportional evolution of pay and firm
size in the period 1980-2011. Note that since the levels of compensation reflect dollar values on
an ex-ante basis (e.g. values of stock-options are evaluated at time granted, as opposed to time
exercised), there is no hard wired link between compensation and stock-market values.

[Table 4 here]

As shown in Table 4, over the recent period 2004 - 2011, movements in CEO compensation
closely follow movements in firm size. In particular, CEO pay and firm size have both decreased
during the crisis (2007 - 2009): average total firm values decreased by 17.4%, equity values by
37.9%, and compensation indices by 27.7%. During 2009-2011, we observe a rebound of firm values
by 19%, equity values by 27%, and compensation indices by 22%. We see these fairly proportional
changes over successive episodes of market drops and market rebound as a strong validity test for
the size of stakes view.
It is important to notice that the size of stakes view does not hinge on the fact that stockmarkets be perfectly efficient. Even if market values were a poor proxy for fundamental values
of firms, the market view developed in GL still applies; it states that the market for talents and
the market for assets are deeply intertwined. If shareholders overvalue asset prices, it is a natural
market outcome that talent be overvalued by the same factor (this is because in our frictionless
framework shareholders have control over hiring decisions).
As in GL, we estimate:

∆t (ln wt ) = γ̂ × ∆t ln S∗,t−1

(3)

where w is either the JMW index or the FS index and S∗ is the mean firm total value of the top
500 largest US-based firms. Again, we restrict our attention to US-based firms for which we can
retrieve CEO compensation in Execucomp. The sample period is 1971-2011.

[Table 5 here]
11

GL find estimates γ̂ = 1.14 using the JMW compensation index and γ̂ = 0.87 using FS compensation index over the period 1971 - 2003. As shown in Table 5, we find extremely close estimates
between 1971 and 2011: γ̂ = 1.01 using the JMW compensation index and γ̂ = 0.82 using FS
compensation index.

[Table 6 here]
Table 6 presents the result of the estimation of equation 3 when S∗ is the mean firm equity
value of the top 500 largest US-based firms in terms of equity value. The fit is rather less good.
This may be because the method puts all the weight on the contemporaneous changes in firm size
and pay. Of course, while the economics predicts that pay will track size one-for-one, there could
be some delay in that relation. Kaplan (2012) has proposed a graphical device that captures the
medium-frequency relation between pay and size (represented by firms size) better than regression
(3). Interestingly, he finds good support for a stable ratio between average pay and average firm
size since 1960.

3.4

Application of the model to non-CEO executives

We see the GL model as particularly adapted to studying CEO pay because the top job in a
firm clearly has firm-wide implications: this makes the hypothesis that the impact of CEO talent
increases in firm size particularly natural. The question of how the impact of other high-paid
executives depends on firm size is highly interesting but opens several debates on the production
function of these executives: the relevant size variable for the impact of non-CEO talent might
be that of a division that the executive is managing; in the cross-section, it might be that some
positions that are held by a single individual in small firms are transformed into two distinct
positions in larger firms; last, in the time-series, organizational trends might have changed the
composition of the executive suite, such as the elimination of intermediate hierarchical layers (e.g.
the elimination of the COO function in many firms: see Rajan and Wulf 2006). But, beyond
these caveats, we find that estimating the GL model on non-CEO executives is an interesting and
natural empirical question. Thus, we provide a version of our benchmark regression on non-CEO
12

executives (see Tables 7 and 8 below). To do this, we simply compute for each firm the average
non-CEO compensation as reported in execucomp; we use the same definitions of compensation
and market value as those used in the CEO comp regressions. We find results that are highly
similar to those on CEOs: in particular, we do not reject the fact that the sum of coefficients on
firm total value and reference firm value is one. In the time series, it turns out that non-CEO pay
has followed an evolution strikingly similar to that of CEO pay: between 1992 (which is the first
year in Execucomp) and 2011, it has increased by a factor of 2.5, while CEO pay has increased by
a factor of 3 (see Figure 3). These results suggest that the GL model can be used to describe the
market of non-CEO executives.

3.5

Robustness checks

In the online appendix, we present robustness checks of the regression results in Tables 2 and 3.5

3.5.1

Sticky Equity Awards

Some firms follow a“fixed number”policy for the design of the CEO long term incentive plan (see
e.g. Hall 1999) – i.e, the same number of, say, options is granted to the CEO over a certain
number of years. For these firms, an increase in the stock price mechanically increases the value
of equity grants. Accordingly, part of the association between CEO pay and firm size presented in
Table 2 might be “mechanical”. We address this concern by excluding the observations for which
we suspect the presence of a “fixed number” policy. For this, we look at the number of options
(execucomp variable OPTION AWARDS NUM), the number of performance shares (execucomp
variable SHRTARG in the pre-2006 format, and EQ TARG in the new format) , and the number of
shares granted under non-performance-based plans (execucomp variable SHARES GRT, available
only from 2006) to capture “fixed number” policies.

[Tables 9 and 10 here]
Specifically, we exclude from the estimation of equation 2 the observations for which the number
of options (respectively performance shares, shares granted under non-performance-based plans)

13

granted to the CEO in year t is positive and the same as in year t − 1. This criterion excludes
around 9% of the observations. As shown in Tables 9 and 10, the coefficients remain very similar
to those in Tables 2 and 3.

3.5.2

Changes in the definition of TDC1

Execucomp changed in 2006 the definition of TDC1 to reflect new reporting rules mandated by the
SEC. FAS 123 (R) required equity compensation to be based on the ex ante value of the awards.
In the pre-2006 format, the execucomp variable TDC1 included the ex post value of performance
shares. To deal with this problem, we follow Walker (2009) and construct a consistent definition
of CEO pay over the whole sample period: when measured in its pre-2006 format, we subtract
from TDC1 the amount paid under the company’s long-term incentive plan (execucomp variable
LTIP). We then add the ex ante value of performance shares by multiplying the target number of
performance shares granted (execucomp variable SHRTARG) by the stock price at the end of the
fiscal year. When missing, the variable SHRTARG is replaced by 0.6

[Tables 11 and 12 here]
Tables 11 and 12 reproduce the regressions presented in Tables 2 and 3 when TDC1 is adjusted
as mentioned above. Again, the coefficients turn out to be very similar.

Conclusion and Some Open Questions

The crisis offered new events to see the reaction of compensation to firm size, and the GL theory
appears to pass the test. We wish to highlight that there are still many things about this view to
explore, enrich, or perhaps correct. For instance, behavioral factors in the perception of CEO talent
could be important (Malmendier and Tate 2009). Because of this possibility, GL works out how
contagion effects could potentially strongly affect CEO pay. Bereskin and Cicero (2013) present
some evidence in support of that effect.
On the theoretical side, it would be good to extend the model to incentives (see Edmans, Gabaix
6
Unfortunately, the variable SHRTARG is often missing. We thus do not know whether this adjustment introduces
more or less bias in the estimation of equation 2.

14

and Landier (2009) and Edmans and Gabaix (2011) for static models that integrate well with GL,
and Dittmann, Maug and Spalt (2011) for a behavioral approach), in particular with dynamic
incentives and CEO turnover (see Jenter and Kanaan forth. and Eisfeldt-Kuhnen 2012). This
remains difficult, though perhaps within reach.
Also, integrating the CEO market with other talent markets (as in Kaplan and Rauh 2010 and
the spirit of Rosen 1981) would be good. Conceptually, we would expect some integration with
the market for CEO of private companies and for hedge fund managers, for instance. It is likely
that studying this integration might shed light on the increase in inequality, particularly with the
rise of top incomes (Piketty and Saez 2003, Lemieux, MacLeod and Parent 2009). In that respect,
relatedly, progress in the measurement of “talent” and “CEO skill” is encouraging (Bertrand and
Schoar 2003, Custodio, Ferreira and Matos forth., Falato, Li and Milbourn 2012, Bennedsen et al.
2012).
Kaplan (2012), building on Frydman and Saks (2010), finds that the GL theory works well in
the 1960-2010 sample, but less so before. Why is that? One reason is that stock market values
were depressed, so perhaps the full firm value (debt + equity) was higher than pure equity (which
is what Kaplan uses). Another important under-researched channel is the supply of skills. One
possibility that would be reasonably researchable would be that the supply of skills was lower before
1960 (perhaps because of technology, GI bill etc.), and that supply of MBA and college graduates
increased after World War II. That hypothesis seems researchable as more data becomes available
(Goldin and Katz 2008).
Finally, as many countries now have started forcing the disclosure of pay, investigating pay in
those countries seems both doable and informative.

Appendix: Summary of Gabaix-Landier (2008)

We summarize the GL model here, paraphrasing in part earlier expositions in GL and Edmans,
Gabaix and Landier (2009).
A continuum of firms and potential managers are matched together. Firm n ∈ [0, N ] has size
S (n) and manager m ∈ [0, N ] has talent T (m). Low n denotes a larger firm and low m a more
talented manager: S 0 (n) < 0, T 0 (m) < 0. n (m) can be thought of as the rank of the manager
(firm), or a number proportional to it, such as its quantile of rank.

19

We consider the problem faced by one particular firm. The firm has a “baseline” value of S.
At t = 0, it hires a manager of talent T for one period. The manager’s talent increases the firm’s
value according to
S 0 = S + CT S γ ,

(4)

where C parameterizes the productivity of talent. If large firms are more difficult to change than
small firms, then γ < 1. If γ = 1, the model exhibits constant returns to scale (CRS) with respect
to firm size.
Let w (m) denote the equilibrium compensation of a CEO with index m. Firm n, taking the
market compensation of CEOs as given, selects manager m to maximize its value net of wages:
max CS (n)γ T (m) − w (m) .
m

(5)

The competitive equilibrium involves positive assortative matching, i.e. m = n, and so w0 (n) =
CS (n)γ T 0 (n). Let wN denote the reservation wage of the least talented CEO (n = N ). Hence we
obtain the classic assignment equation (Sattinger (1993), Tervio (2007)):
Z

N

w (n) = −

CS (u)γ T 0 (u) du + wN .

(6)

n

Specific functional forms are required to proceed further. We assume a Pareto firm size distribution with exponent 1/α: S (n) = An−α . Using results from extreme value theory, GL use the
following asymptotic value for the spacings of the talent distribution: T 0 (n) = −Bnβ−1 . These
functional forms give the wage equation in closed form, taking the limit as n/N → 0:

Z

N

w (n) =
n

Aγ BCu−αγ+β−1 du + w =

i
Aγ BC h −(αγ−β)
Aγ BC −(αγ−β)
n
− N −(αγ−β) + wN ∼
n
.
αγ − β
αγ − β
(7)

To interpret equation (7), we consider a reference firm, for instance firm number 250 – the
median firm in the universe of the top 500 firms. Denote its index n∗ , and its size S(n∗ ). We obtain
Proposition 2 from GL, which we repeat here.
Proposition (GL 2008). In equilibrium, manager n runs a firm of size S (n), and is paid

20

according to the “dual scaling” equation
w (n) = D (n∗ ) S(n∗ )β/α S (n)γ−β/α

(8)

where S(n∗ ) is the size of the reference firm and D (n∗ ) = −Cn∗ T 0 (n∗ ) / (αγ − β) is a constant
independent of firm size.
There are strong reasons to have γ = 1, which is the classic constant returns to scale case, which
is useful in most firms studies (e.g. Luttmer 2007). The Zipf’s law for firms sizes leads to α = 1.
Calibrating in the cross section, like in Table 1, yields γ − β/α ' 1/3, hence β = 2/3. There is no
“intrinsic” reason why we should expect β = 2/3. It would be very interesting to find some reason
(perhaps based on the inference from past performance) for it. This calibration yields:
w (n) = D (n∗ ) S(n∗ )2/3 S (n)1/3

(9)

Hence, in the cross section, we have w (n) ∝ S (n)γ−β/α = S (n)1/3 : log wage is proportional to
log firm size, with a mild slope of 1/3.
However, in the time-series, the average wage behaves like the wage of the reference firm, which
satisfies w (n∗ ) ∝ S (n∗ )γ = S (n∗ )1 . The time-series slope of log wage on log size is higher, at 1.
The reason is that in the cross-section, the “effective supply” a given firm faces is quite elastic:
if it grows, it can just poach a better CEO from an other firms. However, in the “time-series”, the
supply is not elastic: if all firms grow, they can’t poach new CEOs from elsewhere.7

7
That’s because by assumption we assume a zero elasticity of labor supply from CEOs; but the more general point
of a higher elasticity in the cross-section than in the time-series is generally valid.

21

Figure 1: Executive Compensation and Size of the Top 500 Firms
FS compensation index is based on Frydman and Saks (2010). Total Compensation is the sum of salaries,
bonuses, long-term incentive payments, and the Black-Scholes value of options granted. The data are based on the
three highest-paid officers in the largest 50 firms in 1940, 1960, and 1990. The JMW Compensation Index is based
on the data of Jensen, Murphy, and Wruck (2004). Their sample encompasses all CEOs included in the S&P 500,
using data from Forbes and ExecuComp. CEO total pay includes cash pay, restricted stock, payouts from long-term
pay programs, and the value of stock options granted from 1992 onward using ExecuComp’s modified Black-Scholes
approach. Compensation prior to 1978 excludes option grants and is computed between 1978 and 1991 using the
amounts realized from exercising stock options. Both compensation indices are available until 2004. From 2005 to
2011, the FS compensation index in year t equals the FS compensation index in year t−1 times the annual percentage
increase in the mean CEOs compensation – defined as ExecuComp variable TDC1 – of the top 500 largest US-based
firms (in term of total market firm value, i.e. debt plus equity). We use the same methodology to extend the JMW
Compensation Index. The formula we use for total firm value is (CSHO*PRCC F+AT-CEQ-TXDB), computed at
the end of the previous fiscal year. Deferred Taxes (item TXDB) is set to 0 when missing. TOP 500 Firm Value is
the mean firm value of the top 500 largest US-based firms (in terms of firm value). TOP 500 Equity Value is the
mean market equity value – defined as (CSHO*PRCC F) – of the top 500 largest US-based firms (in terms of equity

22

value). In both cases, after 1992, we exclude firms with missing data on CEO compensation from our computations.
All indices are normalized to be equal to 1 in 1980. All quantities were first converted into constant dollars using the
GDP deflator of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

23

Figure 2: Size Distribution of the Top 500 Firms in 2010
In 2010, we take the top 500 US-based firms by total firm value with non-missing data on CEO compensation,
order them by size, S(1) ≥ S(2) ≥ ... ≥ S(500) , and plot ln S on the horizontal axis and ln(Rank − 12 ) on the vertical
axis. Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011) recommend the − 21 term and show that it removes the leading small sample bias.
Regressing ln(Rank − 12 ) = −ζln(S)+constant yields a Pareto exponent ζ = 0.915 (standard error 0.057), R2 = 0.99.
ζ close to 1 is indicative of an approximate Zipf’s law for firm total value.

Table 1: CEO PAY AND DIFFERENT PROXIES FOR FIRM SIZE
The sample consists of all US-based firms between 1992 and 2011 for which we can retrieve both firm size in Compustat
and CEO compensation in Execucomp. We select each year the top 1000 largest firms (in term of total market firm
value, i.e. debt plus equity). We then regress the log compensation of the CEO – using the ExecuComp total
compensation variable TDC1, which includes salary, bonus, restricted stock granted, and the Black-Scholes value of
stock-options granted – in year t on the log of the firm’s size proxies at the end of year t − 1. All nominal quantities
were first converted into 2000 constant dollars using the GDP deflator of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The
formula we use for total firm value is (CSHO*PRCC F+AT-CEQ-TXDB). Deferred Taxes (item TXDB) is set to 0
when missing. Income is measured as earnings before interest and taxes, defined from Compustat as (OIBDP-DP).
Sales is measured with Compustat item SALE. Equity value is (CSHO*PRCC F). The industries are the Fama French
[1997] 48 sectors. We report standard errors clustered at the firm level (first line) and at the year level (second line).

of the top 500 largest US-based firms (in terms ot equity value). To be included in the sample after 1992, a firm
must have non-missing information on CEO compensation in ExecuComp. We show Newey-West standard errors
in parentheses, allowing the error term to be autocorrelated for up to two lags. The Jensen–Murphy–Wruck index
is based on the data of Jensen, Murphy, and Wruck (2004). The Frydman–Saks index is based on Frydman and
Saks (2010). Both compensation indexes are available until 2004. From 2005 to 2010, the FS compensation index in
year t equals the FS compensation index in year t − 1 times the annual increase in the mean CEOs compensation
(ExecuComp variable TDC1) of the top 500 largest US-based firms (in term of total market firm value, i.e. debt
plus equity). We use the same methodology to extend the JMW Compensation Index. The formula we use for firm
value is (CSHO*PRCC F+AT-CEQ-TXDB), computed at the end of the previous fiscal year. Deferred Taxes (item
TXDB) is set to 0 when missing. Quantities are deflated using the Bureau of Economic Analysis GDP deflator.

Figure 3: Non-CEO Executive Compensation and Size of the Top 500 Firms

CEO compensation in year t is the mean CEO compensation of the top 500 largest US-based firms (in terms of
firm value). Non-CEO compensation in year t is the average non-CEO compensation of the top 500 largest USbased firms (in terms of firm value). We compute non-CEO compensation for each firm-year by taking the average
compensation of non-CEO executives present in ExecuComp. TOP 500 Firm Value is the mean firm value of the top
500 largest US-based firms (in terms of firm value). TOP 500 Equity Value is the mean market equity value – defined
as (CSHO*PRCC F) – of the top 500 largest US-based firms (in terms of equity value). All indices are normalized to
be equal to 1 in 1992. All quantities were first converted into constant dollars using the GDP deflator of the Bureau
of Economic Analysis.

The sample consists of all US-based firms between 1992 and 2011 for which we can retrieve both firm size in Compustat
and the identity of the CEO in Execucomp. We select each year the top n (n = 500, 1000) largest firms (in term
of total market firm value, i.e. debt plus equity). The formula we use for total firm value is (CSHO*PRCC F+ATCEQ-TXDB). Deferred Taxes (item TXDB) is set to 0 when missing. We retrieve for each executive present in
