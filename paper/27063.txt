ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes a sequential approach to lifting interventions in the COVID-19 pandemic
taking heterogeneity in the population into account. The population is heterogeneous in terms of
the consequences of infection (need for hospitalization and critical care, and mortality) and in
terms of labor force participation. Splitting the population in two groups by age, a less affected
younger group that is more likely to work, and a more affected older group less likely to work,
and lifting interventions sequentially (for the younger group first and the older group later on) can
substantially reduce mortality, demands on the health care system, and the economic cost of
interventions.

Sequential Lifting of COVID-19 Interventions with
Population Heterogeneity ∗

April 17, 2020

Abstract
This paper analyzes a sequential approach to lifting interventions in the COVID-19
pandemic taking heterogeneity in the population into account. The population is
heterogeneous in terms of the consequences of infection (need for hospitalization
and critical care, and mortality) and in terms of labor force participation. Splitting
the population in two groups by age, a less affected younger group that is more
likely to work, and a more affected older group less likely to work, and lifting
interventions sequentially (for the younger group first and the older group later on)
can substantially reduce mortality, demands on the health care system, and the
economic cost of interventions.
Keywords: COVID-19; pandemic; epidemiological model

The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on life around the globe. The severe interventions that suppression strategies entail have resulted in massive collateral damage to
society and the world economy. Policies enacted by fiscal and monetary authorities are
designed to blunt the impact of the dramatic reduction in economic activity by providing
transfers and extending credit. But even drastic fiscal and monetary measures can only
address disruptions of the scale experienced in many countries temporarily. Suppression
strategies that result in lockdown for the better part of an 18-month period or until a
vaccine is found as suggested by Ferguson et al. (2020) do not seem economically and
politically feasible even for governments with substantial fiscal capacity, let alone for the
typical government. In the best-case scenario, suppression strategies are so effective and
testing capacity raised sufficiently quickly that epidemic spread is stopped around the
world in a few months and does not rebound once the drastic interventions are lifted.

In a more likely scenario, the epidemic spread will rebound as interventions are eased,
especially given the global interconnectedness of the world economy. An evaluation of
approaches to progressively lifting interventions and switching from suppression to mitigation strategies is hence urgently needed.
We focus on the health and economic consequences of a sequential approach that lifts
interventions for the less vulnerable fraction of the population first and for the more vulnerable fraction of the population second. We show that this approach reduces mortality
while increasing economic activity (relative to delayed lifting of interventions) by allowing
the fraction of the population, which participates in the labor market to a greater extent,
to return to work earlier. That said, technological progress in testing and pharmaceutical interventions, including development of treatments and a vaccine, continue to be a
priority, as is increasing the capacity of the health system in terms of testing, hospital
beds, and critical care. In fact, a mitigation approach makes such progress more urgent
not less. An added benefit of imposing non-pharmaceutical interventions on the more
vulnerable population for longer is that, by the time interventions are lifted on this population, health system capacity has increased and treatments, and even a vaccine, may
be available.
This paper considers a deliberately simple discrete time version of the Kermack and
McKendrick (1927) Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with a heterogeneous
population to study the implications for mortality, the demands on the health system,
and the economy. We consider a population comprised of two groups (but the approach
can be extended to multiple groups in a straightforward matter). The two populations
differ in the consequences of infection and in their participation in labor force. Specifically,
one group is comprised of younger people who are less affected by infection and have a
higher labor force participation rate. The other group is comprised of older people who
are more affected by infection and have a lower labor force participation rate.
We show that a sequential approach to lifting interventions, in which the less affected
younger group is released earlier and the more affected older group is released later, can
substantially reduce mortality, the demands on the health care system, and the drop in
economic activity. In our baseline specification, mortality is reduced by close to 40% and
peak load hospitalizations and critical care demand by about 75% and 80%, respectively,
compared to lifting interventions on both groups at the same time. Mortality is reduced
because by the time restrictions are lifted for the more vulnerable population a sizable part
of the population has recovered reducing the infectiousness of the pandemic. A staggered
lifting of interventions reduces peak load demand for health care directly, but importantly
also indirectly, if the more vulnerable group is released only once a sizable fraction of the

2

less vulnerable group has recovered which reduces the speed of infection. Most noteworthy
is that the sequential approach makes a substantial reduction in mortality possible and
herd immunity is achieved with a lower fraction of the population ever infected. The
fact that the less affected group participates in the labor force to a greater extent is a
fortunate coincidence, as the economic consequences of interventions can be reduced with
the sequential approach compared to a delayed lifting of interventions for both groups.
The output loss in our baseline sequential strategy is about 16% (of annual output), which
is more than the 10% output loss if interventions are lifted early for both groups, but
drastically less than the 40% output loss associated with delayed lifting of interventions
for both groups.
Chikina and Pegdeny (2020) consider the consequences of similar age-targeted mitigation strategies for mortality and the demands on the health system.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 describes the SIR model with a heterogeneous
population. Section 2 evaluates the various strategies for lifting interventions. Section 3
considers various extensions and provides further discussion. Section 4 concludes. Appendix A reviews the basic discrete-time SIR model with a homogeneous population.

SIR model with heterogeneous population

We consider a SIR model with heterogeneity building on Allen (1994). Consider a population of size normalized to one. The population comprises two groups, labeled 1 and 2,
P
of size ω1 and ω2 where ωj ∈ (0, 1), j∈J ωj = 1, and J = {1, 2}. Denote the fraction
of group j which is susceptible, infected, recovered, and deceased by sj , ij , rj , and dj ,
respectively, where sj + ij + rj + dj = 1. The fraction susceptible in the population overall
P
P
is then s =
ω
s
,
the
fraction
infected
in
the
population
is
i
=
j
j
j∈J
j∈J ωj ij , and
analogously for other variables. The contact rate at which type j meets type k is βjk > 0,
where by symmetry βjk = βkj . The fraction that recover or die each period is γ ∈ (0, 1),
of which fraction δj ∈ (0, 1) die.
We consider γ a fixed parameter determined by the disease. However, the rate at
which the population meets is considered a policy variable determined by intervention,
which may vary over time, that is, β(t), but we suppress this dependence on time t
henceforth.
Susceptible individuals in group j contact individuals in group k at rate βjk . Contact
with an infected individual leads to infection and the probability of contact with an
infected individual of type k is ωk ik ; the rate of contact with an infected individual of
P
any type is hence k∈J βjk ωk ik . A key assumption is that recovered individuals are no
3

longer susceptible to infection. The dynamics of the fraction of group j that is susceptible,
infected, recovered, and deceased are

describe the dynamics for a population with any number J of groups. However, for
simplicity we only consider the case with two groups. By analogy with the standard
SIR model without heterogeneity
(see Appendix A), the reproduction ratio for group j

and for the population overall as R0 (t) =

. If this reproduction ratio exceeds 1 in group j or the population
overall, the pandemic will spread in that group or the population, respectively.
Note that the assumptions about mortality δj in each group do not affect the dynamics
of the epidemic in terms of sj and ij , as equations (1) and (2) are independent of equations
(3) and (4) and do not involve the parameters δj . The assumptions about δj do of course
affect the fraction of the population that eventually recovers and the implications of the
pandemic for mortality.
We model the demand on the health system by simply assuming that a fraction φhj ∈
(0, 1) of the infected in group j require hospitalization and a fraction φcj ∈ (0, 1) require
critical care. Therefore, the fraction hospitalized in group j is hj = φhj ij and the fraction
requiring critical care is cj = φcj ij . The fraction hospitalized in the overall population is
P
P
h = j∈J φhj ωj ij and the fraction requiring critical care c = j∈J φcj ωj ij .
We model the economy simply as output being produced by individuals who participate in the labor force using a linear technology requiring only labor inputs. Labor force
participation lj depends on the group j. We assume all individuals who work are equally
productive and normalize the productivity to one. We assume that the infected population cannot participate in the labor force, while the susceptible and recovered population
participate such that output of group j is yj = lj (sj + rj ). Aggregate output in the
P
economy is hence y = j∈J lj ωj (sj + rj ). Finally, we assume that if a group is subject
to the intervention due to the pandemic, only a fraction of the population of the group
can participate in the labor force from home. This is the main way in which intervention
reduces economic activity.

Evaluation of strategies to lift interventions

This section evaluates a sequential strategy to lift interventions as well as two alternative
strategies which treat the entire population symmetrically, one lifting the interventions
early and the other lifting the interventions late. We find that the sequential strategy
reduces mortality and the demands on the health system substantially compared to the
two alternative strategies considered. In terms of economic consequences, lifting interventions early for the entire population is associated with the lowest output loss, but the
sequential strategy has drastically lower output losses than lifting interventions late for
the entire population.

2.1

Calibration

We calibrate the baseline model using data for the COVID-19 pandemic mostly from
Ferguson et al. (2020). Panel A of Table 1 displays the significant age-dependence of
morbidity and mortality due to infection. Hospitalization rates increase substantially
with age; they are low for individuals below 50 years of age and rise considerably with
age above 50. The pattern in the need for critical care is more drastic, with very few cases
requiring critical care for individuals below 50, limited need for individuals between 50
and 59, and a substantial increase for older individuals. The pattern in mortality is the
most dramatic; mortality is low for individuals below 60 but increases very substantially
for the groups in their 60s, 70s and 80 and above. Notice that each ten-year age bracket
contains roughly equal population, except for the top two: the population age 70 or older
is roughly equal in population to each of the ten-year age brackets below.
Labor force participation displays the opposite pattern: labor force participation is
roughly constant at above 80% for the age groups 25-34 to 45-54 and falls to 65% and
27% for individuals aged 55-64 and 65-74, respectively. Labor force participation below
25 is also lower, although one could argue that schooling is investment in human capital
and thus should be considered as producing output as well.
Based on this data we calibrate a model with two groups, Groups 1 and 2; see Panel B
of Table 1. Group 1 comprises the population 0 to 54 years old, which is about 71% of the
population overall. Group 2 comprises the population 55 years old and up, about 29%
of the population. Since the hospitalization and critical care rates from Ferguson et al.
(2020) are for symptomatic cases only, we adjust these downward by 50% to account for
asymptomatic cases. The hospitalization and critical care rates are 1.22% and 0.08% in
the younger group and 9.56% and 3.75% in the older group. We take the mortality rate
from Ferguson et al. (2020), but adjust the overall rate, so that the average mortality rate
5

replicates their predicted number of deaths in the unmitigated scenario.1 The mortality
in Group 1 is 0.06% compared to 2.67% in Group 2, a dramatic difference.
As a fraction of the working age population 16 years old and up, Group 1 makes
up about 64% and Group 2 about 36%. The labor force participation rate (among the
working age population) is about 76% in Group 1 and 40% in Group 2. This implies
that Group 1 constitutes 77% of the labor force while Group 2 constitutes 23%. Given
the assumption that all individuals are equally productive, these fractions are also the
fraction of output generated by each group. Income data by age could be used to calibrate
the economic importance of the two groups more precisely.
We choose 55 years of age as the cutoff so that the younger group contains a large
fraction of the labor force and the older group a large fraction of the more vulnerable
population, but a different cutoff could be considered. We choose to split the population
in just two groups for simplicity and to facilitate the interpretation, but one could consider
a more stratified approach where interventions are lifted for an even younger group first,
and then progressively for older and older groups.
We calibrate the epidemiological parameters largely based on some of the baseline
values considered by Ferguson et al. (2020). The basic reproduction number for COVID19 we consider is 2.4, but there is considerable uncertainty about this value.2 Following
Atkeson (2020) we calibrate the recovery rate to 7/18, as the expected duration of the
disease is 18 days and a period in our model corresponds to a week. The implied baseline
contact rate without heterogeneity is thus β ≡ βjk = R0 γ = 0.93, which we assume is
identical across groups without intervention. We assume that intervention reduces the
contact rate by 75% to 0.25β in our baseline intervention strategy, with details discussed
below.
In terms of output, we calibrate the labor force participation rate to the one observed
in the data. Moreover, we assume that all individuals are equally productive, that infected
individuals cannot work, and that individuals subject to intervention have to work from
home, if they can, and calibrate the fraction of work which can be done from home to
46% (which is a wage-weighted average) following Dingel and Neiman (2020).
1
Ferguson et al. (2020) report that in their unmitigated scenario 81% of the U.S. population would
be eventually infected and there would be 2.2 million deaths; given a U.S. population of 330 million, this
implies a death rate of 0.82%. We adjust the population-weighted average mortality rate from Panel A
of Figure 1 of 1.12% to match that number and adjust the mortality rate in each group accordingly.
2
A lower number implies the pandemic spreads more slowly, which reduces peak health system
demands but would mean the lifting of interventions for Group 2 would need to be further delayed.

2.2

Alternative strategies

In our baseline calibration, we consider the following three intervention lifting strategies.
The first two treat the entire population homogenously, lifting the general intervention for
both groups at the same time, either early or late. The third strategy involves sequential
lifting of interventions for the younger group (Group 1) first and for the older group
(Group 2) later on.
The specific timing is as follows. We start the population in week 1 (week of January
5, 2020) with 0.01% of the population infected. The pandemic spreads with contact rates
assumed to be constant at β for all groups. In week 11 (week of March 15, 2020), a general
intervention is implemented which reduces all contact rates to 0.25β. The strategies we
consider differ in when and how these interventions are lifted. The two homogenous
strategies lift the interventions for both groups at the same time, either in week 16 (week
of April 19, 2020) (we call this strategy “Early Lifting”) or in week 45 (week of November
8, 2020) (“Late Lifting”), when the contact rates go back to their pre-intervention values.
The sequential strategy lifts the intervention for Group 1 (young) in week 16, but delays
lifting the intervention for Group 2 (old) until week 45; we call this strategy “Sequential
Lifting.” During the time where the intervention is lifted for Group 1 but not Group 2,
we assume that the contact rate among Group 2 (old) and between Group 1 and Group 2
is 0.25β, while the contact rate among Group 1 (young) returns to its pre-intervention
level. The contact rates for these interventions are summarized in Panel A of Table 2.

2.3

Quantitative evaluation

Table 3 evaluates the three strategies quantitatively and Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the
dynamics. We first describe the quantitative results for the Early Lifting strategy, our
first homogenous strategy, which we use as our benchmark to assess the gains from the
sequential strategy. We note that, except for the economic costs, the results from our
second homogenous strategy, the Late Lifting strategy, are rather similar, so this description applies to both homogenous strategies we consider. The overall mortality rate is
high: 0.74% of the population eventually die from the disease.3 The mortality rate is
low for Group 1, namely 0.05%, but rather high for Group 2 at 2.41%. The demands
on the health system are also massive, with the peak hospitalization rate at 0.86% of
the population and the peak critical care rate at 0.27%; these vastly exceed hospital bed
capacity of 0.29% (according to the WHO) and ICU capacity of around 0.02% (according
3

This is because our calibration follows that of Ferguson et al. (2020); calibrating mortality based
on Lourenço et al. (2020) results in considerably lower numbers as we show in the sensitivity analysis in
Section 2.4.

to IHME). The reason is that with a homogenous lifting strategy there is a massive spike
in infections (and hence hospitalizations and demand for critical care) when the interventions are lifted (see Column A in Figure 2). When interventions are lifted across the
board, the reproduction ratio goes back to almost the basic reproduction number R0 (as
the middle panel in Figure 1, Column A, shows) and the pandemic spreads very quickly,
resulting in a spike in deaths. Economic output drops during the intervention, then rebounds, but drops again when infections spike. The output losses are large, roughly 10%
of output, but the downturn is quite transitory (see the bottom panel in Column A of
the figure). We should caution that our model of the economy is simplistic, and does not
have its own dynamics or consider financial factors. In this early lifting strategy, about
90% are eventually infected, or in other words only about 10% of the population are never
infected.
Consider now the Sequential Lifting strategy. Mortality is still high, at 0.46%, but
this is a reduction of about 38% relative to the homogenous Early Lifting strategy, which
is quite substantial. The mortality of both groups drops, to 0.05% and 1.47%, respectively. Most of the reduction in mortality comes from Group 2 (old). Peak demand
for hospitalizations and critical care drop to 0.22% and 0.05%, respectively. These are
reductions of 75% to 80% compared to the Early Lifting strategy, which is massive. In
fact, peak demands are now more in line with capacity, although critical care needs still
exceed normal capacity by a factor 2 or more.
How is this reduction accomplished? From Figures 1 and 2 we see that the fraction
infected is considerably flatter in this strategy and shows two, much flatter peaks. This
is because the interventions are lifted sequentially. The reproduction ratio rises substantially when the interventions for Group 1 (young) are lifted, but not nearly to the basic
reproduction number R0 . Over time, it falls below one, and while it jumps when the
interventions for Group 2 (old) are lifted, it stays below one for the population overall.
The result is a double hump shape in infections, hospitalizations, demand for critical
care, and deaths, but which lower peaks. While Group 2 (old) remains subject to the
interventions during the first peak, most of the deaths even in this phase are from this
older group. This is because there is contact between the two groups even during this
sequential phase. The large reduction in mortality is possible, because by the time the
interventions are lifted for the older group, a sizable fraction of the population has already
recovered, which reduces the reproduction ratio and results in a much lower fraction of
the older group ever getting infected: under the homogenous Early Lifting strategy, about
10% are never infected, whereas under the sequential strategy 45% of Group 2 (old) are
never infected (see Table 3). This is the mechanism that allows a substantial reduction

8

in overall mortality.
The output loss associated with the sequential strategy is larger than that when
all interventions are lifted early, a loss of about 16% of annual output compared to
10%, as Group 2 (old) is subject to the interventions for longer and only a fraction of
individuals can work from home. However, since the older group comprises only 23%
of the labor force, the economy recovers considerably when the interventions are lifted
on the younger group. This initial recovery may be enough to stave off an economic
disaster. The implications of a homogenous Late Lifting strategy are very similar to
those associated with the homogenous Early Lifting strategy except for the economic
consequences: because of the extended period of interventions, the output loss associated
with Late Lifting are about 40%, clearly an economic disaster.
We conclude that the Sequential Lifting strategy vastly improves on lifting interventions later for the entire population in terms of economic consequences, while at the same
time substantially reducing mortality and the demands on the health system relative to
homogenous policies that do not take into account the heterogeneity in the population in
terms of vulnerability and economic activity. To state this provocatively: when considering the options of lifting interventions earlier for the less vulnerable population vs. later
for the entire population, there is no trade off between economic activity and mortality.

2.4

Sensitivity analysis

We now consider the sensitivity of our quantitative results to the assumptions about the
effectiveness of the intervention and about the mortality rates. We find that a sequential
policy offers sizable benefits even if interventions are less effective during the sequential
phase or less effective overall, and even if the mortality rate of the disease itself is calibrated to a much lower level. These results are reported in Table 4 and the alternative
assumptions about the effectiveness of the policy are described in Panels B and C in
Table 2.
Consider again the Sequential Lifting strategy, but suppose that shielding the vulnerable population from infection during the phase in which the interventions are lifted
for Group 1 (young) but not Group 2 (old) is difficult. Specifically, suppose the contact
rate between the two groups only drops by 50% (to 0.5β) instead of by 75% (to 0.25β)
as assumed before (see Panel B of Table 2). This results in a more pronounced peak in
infections (and hence demands on the health system and mortality) when the interventions are lifted for Group 1 (young). However, sizable gains from the sequential policy
remain (see Panel A of Table 4). Compared to our baseline calibration, overall mortality
increases to 0.50% (and 1.60% for the older group) and the peak hospitalization and crit9

ical care rates increase to 0.37% and 0.11%, but these still represent reductions of 32% in
mortality and around 60% in demands on the health system relative to the homogenous
strategies. This suggests that a sequential approach is desirable even in this case. The
basic mechanism remains the same: by the time the interventions are lifted on the more
vulnerable population, a larger fraction of the population has already recovered, which
in turn increases the fraction of the more vulnerable population that is never infected.
Next suppose that all interventions are less effective in reducing contact rates, and
that all contact rates are reduced by 50% instead of by 75% as in the baseline scenario
(see Panel C of Table 2). As Panel B of Table 4 shows, the performance of the Early
Lifting strategy is very similar to the baseline case. The Sequential Lifting strategy
does not do quite as well as in our baseline case. Mortality is 0.51% for the population
overall (and 1.64% for the more vulnerable group) and peak demand on the health system
is 0.41% in terms of hospitalizations and 0.12% in terms of critical care. These are still
sizable reductions of over 30% in mortality and more than 50% in terms of demand on the
health system relative to the homogenous Early Lifting strategy. Lifting the interventions
sequentially still offers benefits as a larger fraction of the more vulnerable population is
never infected. Notice that in this parametrization the Late Lifting strategy also offers
some benefits in terms of reduced mortality and demands on the health system, but it
does still come at an enormous economic cost.
Finally, there is considerable debate about the mortality rate of COVID-19. Lourenço
et al. (2020) use a much lower mortality rate of 0.14%. Adjusting the mortality rates of
the two groups accordingly, we find an overall mortality rate in the homogenous Early
Lifting and Late Lifting strategies of 0.13% and 0.41% in the more vulnerable group (see
Panel C in Table 4). In contrast, the Sequential Lifting strategy results in mortality rates
of 0.08% in the population overall and 0.25% in the more vulnerable group, reductions in
mortality of about 40%. In sum, these results suggest that the advantages of a sequential
approach to lifting interventions are reasonably robust to alternative calibrations of the
parameters.

3

Extensions and Discussion

The analysis in this paper is kept deliberately simple to emphasize the key insight that
lifting interventions on the less vulnerable population earlier can increase economic output
while reducing mortality and health system demands at the same time. Here we discuss
several additional advantages of the sequential approach as well as some limitations of
the analysis.

10

3.1

Growth in testing, hospital, and critical care capacity

Much of the recent debate has focused on the desirability of an expansion of testing,
hospital, and critical care capacity. A sequential approach to lifting interventions reduces
peak demand on the health system, but it also allows additional time to increase such
capabilities significantly by the time the interventions are lifted for the more vulnerable
population. This is an additional advantage of the sequential strategy in our view.
Moreover, there is considerable uncertainty about many of the basic parameters of the
disease, including mortality and the extent to which the disease has already spread in the
population. The sequential approach, which shields the more vulnerable population for
longer, raises the possibility that this uncertainty can be reduced considerably before the
interventions are lifted for that part of the population. Indeed, if it turns out that a much
larger fraction of the population has already been exposed and has recovered from the
disease, it may be possible to lift the restrictions for the vulnerable part of the population
much earlier than the analysis here suggests.

3.2

Technological progress in treatment and vaccine

We have not considered the possibility of technological progress in terms of the development of treatments and a vaccine. Our basic insight does not depend on such treatments
or vaccines becoming available, but if they do, the delayed lifting of interventions for
the more vulnerable population makes it more likely that they will be available before
that population is exposed to the disease. That said, if such pharmaceutical progress
were likely to be made very soon, an argument for delaying the lifting of interventions
until then could be made. Similarly, the possibility of significant progress in diagnostic
technologies could make delaying the lifting of interventions optimal, and speed up the
lifting of interventions once such progress has been made. That said, since the approach
considered here involves achieving herd immunity, exposing a large fraction of the less
vulnerable population to the disease is paradoxically beneficial, especially for the more
vulnerable population.

3.3

Discussion

We consider the effect of policies in a simple epidemiological model. In an economic
model, individuals make choices about whether to work, shop, or stay home taking the
risks and consequences of various actions into account. Recent work on economic models
considers the endogenous response of individuals to a pandemic (see, e.g., Eichenbaum
et al. (2020)). In such models, individuals may choose to modify their behavior to reduce
11

contact, and this should be especially true for more vulnerable individuals. Thus, some
of the benefits of the policies analyzed here may arise in equilibrium even in the absence
of policy, although individuals of course do not take into account how their own actions
affect the equilibrium dynamics.
From a policy perspective, the analysis here suggests that employment protections
and financial assistance might optimally be targeted at the more vulnerable population,
reducing the demands on fiscal policy. But the spirit of the analysis is to allow a large
fraction of economic activity by the less vulnerable population to resume, reducing the
financing needs for individuals, firms, and governments.
Several limitations should be noted. First, we stratify the population by age only, but
given that comorbidities significantly affect vulnerability, these should probably also be
taken into account. Second, we stratify the population by age of the individual, but the
households structure should be taken into account. Households should be stratified by
the age of the oldest member; data on the household age structure from the U.S. Census
Bureau suggests that 55% of households have a householder who is less than 55 years old,
which suggests that taking this into account would not dramatically alter our conclusions.

Conclusion

Sequentially lifting interventions in a pandemic, first for the less vulnerable population
and subsequently for the more vulnerable one, can substantially reduce mortality and the
demand on the health care system. In our baseline calibration mortality is reduced by
close to 40% and the peak demand for hospitalization and critical care are reduced by
75% and 80%. Mortality is reduced because by the time restrictions are lifted for the
more vulnerable population a sizable part of the population has recovered reducing the
infectiousness of the pandemic. This means that a larger fraction of the more vulnerable
population is never infected with the virus. Peak demand on the health care system is
reduced for two reasons: on the one hand, there is a direct effect as the restrictions are
lifted for different parts of the population at different times; on the other hand, there is
an indirect effect, namely the fact that a smaller part of the more vulnerable population
is ever infected. Lifting restrictions earlier for the less vulnerable part of the population
substantially reduces the economic cost compared to keeping the restrictions in place for
the entire population for a longer period of time. An additional advantage of a sequential
strategy is that, before the restrictions on the more vulnerable part of the population are
lifted, more is learned about the morbidity and mortality risk of the disease and there is
potential to increase health system capacity and develop testing and possibly treatments

12

and a vaccine, none of which are modeled here.
Several limitations of the analysis should be emphasized. First, there remains substantial parameter uncertainty about morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 and this paper
provides only limited sensitivity analysis to parameters. Second, the cutoff for the two
groups, the number of groups, and the timing of when to lift interventions for the more
vulnerable group has not been optimized. Third, vulnerability should be determined by
the oldest member of the household, not individual-by-individual. Finally, and most importantly, whether a strategy to achieve herd immunity is inevitable, and hence called
for, much depends on the expectations about the feasibility and timing of potential treatments and vaccines, if any. But if lifting restrictions is advised, the age-dependence of
the vulnerability to the disease should be a primary consideration.

for the various lifting strategies. The analysis evaluates three strategies to lifting interventions. Two
strategies treat the entire population homogenously, lifting the general intervention for both groups
either early or late. The third strategy involves sequential lifting of interventions for group 1 (young)
first and group 2 (old) later on. Each panel shows the contact rates before the general intervention (first
column), during the general intervention (second column), during the sequential phase (if applicable)
(third column), and after interventions are lifted for the entire population (fourth column). In the
sequential phase (if any), contact rates differ across group 1 (young) and group 2 (old). Panel A provides
the baseline calibration. Panels B and C consider sensitivity analysis. Panel B assumes the contact
rate between group 1 and 2 is higher during the sequential phase. Panel C assumes interventions are
less effective at reducing all contact rates. The effects of interventions on contact rates are comparable
to those considered in Ferguson et al. (2020). The caption of Figure 1 describes the specific timing
assumptions for each strategy.

Table 3: Evaluation of Lifting of Interventions Strategies: Baseline Calibration
This table presents the quantitative results for the three strategies under the baseline calibration. For
each strategy (Early Lifting; Sequential Lifting; and Late Lifting), the table reports the implications for
mortality (deaths overall and for each group) (as percent of population), health system demand (peak
hospitalization and critical care rate) (as percent of population), economic output loss (as percent of
steady state output), as well as the fraction of the population that was never infected and that has
recovered after two years (overall and for each group). The interventions are described in Panel A of
Table 2. The caption of Figure 1 describes the specific timing assumptions for each strategy.

Table 4: Evaluation of Lifting of Interventions Strategies: Sensitivity Analysis
This table reports sensitivity analysis of the quantitative results in terms of the effectiveness of the
intervention (Panels A and B) and the assumption about the mortality rates. Panel A considers the
sensitivity to a less effective sequential intervention, in which the contact rate between Group 1 (young)
and Group 2 (old) is reduced by 50% only (see Panel B of Table 2 for details). Panel B considers the
sensitivity to a less effective intervention overall, in which all contact rates are reduced by 50% only
(see Panel C of Table 2 for details). Panel C considers the sensitivity to an alternative calibration of
the mortality rate based on Lourenço et al. (2020): mortality rates δj in Table 1 are scaled to match
their baseline infection-to-fatality ratio (IFR) of 0.14% (instead of 0.82% as in our baseline calibration).
In all panels we report the mortality rates (as percent of population) for the three strategies (early,
sequential, and late lifting of interventions) overall and for each group. In Panels A and B we also report
the demands on the health system and the fraction never infected for the three strategies.

Figure 1: Evaluation of Lifting of Interventions Strategies
This figure displays the dynamics of mortality, the reproduction ratio, and economic output for three
strategies over time. The population starts in week of January 5, 2020 (week 1) with 0.01% infected and
the rest susceptible. The general intervention is implemented the week of March 15 (week 11). Column A
considers early lifting of interventions for both groups the week of April 19 (week 16). Column B considers
sequential lifting of interventions for group 1 (young) first (week of April 19; week 16) and group 2 (old)
later (week of November 8; week 45). Column C considers a delayed lifting of interventions for both groups
(week of November 8; week 45). The first row shows death per week (red; right axis) and cumulative
deaths (blue; left axis), both as a fraction of the total population; the values in the overall population are
solid, the values for group 1 (young) are dash-dotted and the values for group 2 (old) are dashed. The
second row shows the reproduction ratio for the population overall R0 (t) (solid), for group 1 (young)
R0,1 (t) (dash-dotted), and for group 2 (old) R0,2 (t) (old). The third row shows economic output of the
population overall (solid), of group 1 (young) (dash-dotted), and of group 2 (old) (dashed).

Appendix A

Basic SIR model without heterogeneity

This appendix describes the basic discrete-time SIR model without heterogeneity. Consider a population of size normalized to one. At each point in time, the population is
comprised of fraction s of susceptible individuals, fraction i of infected individuals, and
fraction r of recovered individuals. Susceptible individuals contact other individuals in
the population at rate β > 0. Contact with an infected person, which happens with
probability i, results in infection. Thus the fraction s0 of the population susceptible next
period is
s0 = s − βsi.
(A1)
The current infected population i increases at a rate βs due to new infections while
fraction γ of the infected recover; therefore, the infected population i0 next period is
i0 = i + βsi − γi.

(A2)

Finally, the recovered population r this period grows due to the infected that recovered
last period; the recovered population r0 next period is therefore
r0 = r + γi.

(A3)

Note that the infected population i grows at rate


βs
i0
− 1 = βs − γ =
− 1 γ.
i
γ
Define the reproduction ratio R0 (t) = βs(t)
, where s(t) is the fraction susceptible at time t.
γ
For a novel disease to which the entire population is susceptible, s(0) is approximately
one, and so R0 ≡ R0 (0) ≈ βγ , often referred to as the basic reproduction number.4
If R0 (0) > 1, the infection will initially spread, but the growth rate of the infected
population R0 (t) = βs(t)
decreases as the susceptible population s(t) decreases.
γ
To account for deaths separately, we can easily modify the model by assuming that γ
is the fraction of infected that recovers or dies per period, of which fraction δ dies (while
fraction 1 − δ recovers); the modified law of motion for the fraction recovered (A3) is
r0 = r + (1 − δ)γi.

(A4)

The modified law of motion for the fraction of the population that has died is
d0 = d + δγi.

(A5)

The laws of motion for the fraction susceptible (A1) and fraction infected (A2) and the
definition of reproduction ratio R0 (t) are unchanged as they do not depend on δ.
4

If the entire population is susceptible, the basic reproduction number is the expected number of
individuals an infected person infects before recovering, as β(1 + (1 − γ) + (1 − γ)2 + . . . ) = βγ = R0 .
