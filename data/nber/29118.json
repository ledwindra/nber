    "abstract": "\n\nElectrification of transportation and buildings to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions requires massive switching from natural gas and refined petroleum products. All three end-use energy sources are mispriced due in part to the unpriced pollution they emit. Natural gas and electricity utilities also face the classic natural monopoly challenge of recovering fixed costs while maintaining efficient pricing. We study the magnitude of these distortions for electricity, natural gas, and gasoline purchased by residential customers across the continental US. We find that the net distortion in pricing electricity is much greater than for natural gas or gasoline. Residential customers in much of the country face electricity prices that are well above social marginal cost (private marginal cost plus unpriced externalities), while in some areas with large shares of coal-fired generation, prices are below SMC. Combining our estimates of marginal price and SMC for each of the fuels with a large survey of California households' energy use, we calculate the distribution of annual fuel costs for space heating, water heating, and electric vehicles under actual pricing versus setting price at SMC. We find that moving prices for all three fuels to equal their SMC would significantly increase the incentive for Californians to switch to electricity for these energy services.\n\n",

Industry partners that provide financial support for the center have a representative on the board.\n\n\nThe board meets twice per year with the center\u2019s leaders and principal investigators to identify and prioritize research areas as well as provide advice and guidance regarding issues, challenges, and opportunities of concern and importance to the industry. The board also develops the request for proposals, the selection process for center research projects, and linkages with additional industry partners.\n\n\nIan Purtle,\t Chair, Cargill\nTom Binder, Vice-Chair, Archer Daniels Midland Company\nTed Crosbie, Member, Monsanto\nMartha Schlicher, Member, Monsanto\nKyle Althoff, Member, DDCE\nCharles Brummer, Member, Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation\nRuss Sanders, Member, Pioneer\nBryan Schramm, Member, Sundrop Fuels, Inc.\nJeff Stroburg, Member, West Central\nSpencer Swayze, Member, Ceres\nScott McQueen, Member, ConocoPhillips\nCandace Wheeler, Member, General Motors\nRodney Williamson, Member, Iowa Corn Growers Association\nBob Wimmer, Member, Toyota\nGreg Keenan, Member, Virent\nAndrew Held, Member, Virent\n\n\n"
