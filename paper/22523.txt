Immunization and Moral Hazard: The HPV Vaccine and Uptake of Cancer Screening
Ali Moghtaderi and Avi Dor
NBER Working Paper No. 22523
August 2016
JEL No. I10,I12
ABSTRACT
Immunization can cause moral hazard by reducing the cost of risky behaviors. In this study, we
examine the effect of HPV vaccination for cervical cancer on participation in the Pap test, which
is a diagnostic screening test to detect potentially precancerous and cancerous process. It is
strongly recommended for women between 21-65 years old even after taking the HPV vaccine. A
reduction in willingness to have a Pap test as a result of HPV vaccination would signal the need
for public health intervention. The HPV vaccination is recommended for women age eleven to
twelve for regular vaccination or for women up to age 26 not vaccinated previously. We present
evidence that probability of vaccination changes around this threshold. We identify the effect of
vaccination using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, centered on the recommended
vaccination threshold age. The results show no evidence of ex ante moral hazard in the short-run.
Sensitivity analyses using alternative specifications and subsamples are in general agreement.
The estimates show that women who have been vaccinated are actually more likely to have a Pap
test in the short-run, possibly due to increased awareness of its benefits.

1. Introduction
Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer related cause of death among women
globally. Virtually all cervical cancers are causally related to infection by Human Papillomavirus
(HPV). Approximately 70% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV types 16 and 18 (Saslow et
al., 2007). Cervical cancer is the easiest gynecological cancer to prevent, and it only requires
regular screening tests and follow-ups. There are two tests for diagnosing cervical cancer, the
Papanicolaou test (Pap test or Pap smear), which looks for cell change in the cervix that might
ultimately become cervical cancer if it is not treated appropriately, and the HPV test, which
looks for the virus (HPV) that can cause these cell changes. The Pap test is recommended for all
women between ages 21 and 65 years old, while the HPV test is recommended for women older
than 30 along with the Pap test (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014).
For decades the Pap test has been one of the most effective and successful cancer
screenings in medicine, yet most women diagnosed with cervical cancer did not receive the test
in the five years dating back to the diagnosis (Saslow et al., 2002). More recently, two HPV
vaccines, Cervarix and Gardasil, became available in the market. These vaccines target HPV
types that most commonly cause cervical cancer. The bivalent vaccine (Cervarix) and
quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil) can protect against HPV types 16 and 18, which worldwide are
responsible for about 70% of cervical cancer. Gardasil also protects against HPV types 6 and 11,
which cause 90% of genital warts. These vaccines are highly effective in preventing the targeted
HPV types (Skinner et al., 2008). Cervarix was approved in 2009 by the Food and Drug
administration, and Gardasil was approved in 2006 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2015). Prior to these approval dates, no vaccine for HPV was available in the market.

Despite the relative efficacy of the various HPV vaccines, regular Pap tests are
recommended for women who have been sexually active even after HPV vaccination (American
Cancer Society, 2014). Several important reasons account for that. First, vaccination does not
protect against all HPV types not included in the first generation of the vaccines. About 30% of
cervical cancer occurrences will not be prevented by the HPV vaccines. Second, protection
against the targeted types cannot be expected to be absolute. Additionally, women who got the
HPV vaccine after becoming sexually active might not get the full benefit of the vaccine if they
already had been exposed to the virus. These factors, along with the fact that long term effects of
the vaccine are unknown at the time being, suggest the need to use both prevention strategies,
namely the vaccine d the screening test as complements in order to minimize risks (Franco et al.,
2006).
In the insurance literature, economists have drawn a distinction between ex-post and exante moral hazard (Ehrlich and Becker, 1972; Dave and Kaestner, 2009). Insurance can cause
consumers to increase medical expenditures to inefficiently high levels due to a change in the
relative price of health care (ex-post moral hazard), yet it also provides an incentive for people to
under invest in self-protection or to engage in risky health behavior (ex-ante moral hazard).
Another source of ex-ante moral hazard which has received less attention stems from Medical
innovations that appear to change risk perceptions. For example, advances in heart disease
treatments have contributed to the dramatic rise in obesity in the population (Peltzman, 2011), as
has access to improved and lower-cost treatment for diabetes (Klick & Stratmann, 2007).
Similarly, less invasive cardiac procedures are less likely to induce reductions in smoking rates
as compared with older and more intensive procedures (Margolis et al., 2014). HPV vaccination
can also cause moral hazard in low income adolescents as they are more likely to get involved in

2

risky sexual behaviors in response to taking the HPV vaccine compared to those who have not
initiated the vaccine (Hill, 2014).
In this study, we look at the behavioral response to the HPV vaccine. Specifically, we
look into the effect of vaccination on the decision to participate in Pap tests in the short run
(having a Pap test in the past 12 months). If vaccination leads to a reduction in participation in
Pap tests, it could potentially increase the incidence of cervical cancer. This should be of
concern to public health policy makers. The empirical evidence presented by Ferris et al. (2012)
shows that women are more receptive to getting the HPV vaccine when offered the choice of
longer Pap test intervals, and Pap test non-compliers are more likely to opt for the HPV vaccine
when a Pap test is required less frequently. A study in Australia showed that among women 2529 years of age, screening rates for those previously vaccinated were about ten percent lower
than for women who had not been vaccinated (Budd et al., 2014). Women who reported receipt
of the HPV vaccine are more likely than those not vaccinated to plan to receive a Pap test within
three years (Price et al., 2011). However, these findings might not be causal since women who
are more health conscious are also more likely to get vaccinated and to have a Pap test
administered. Moreover, intention to have a Pap test does not necessarily lead to having it done.
This paper contributes to the literature by investigating the actual behavior (rather than
intention) of women having Pap tests after HPV vaccination. Moreover, it addresses an
econometric issue in the estimation of the effect of vaccination on participation in Pap tests:
namely that the decision to initiate the vaccine and the decision to participate in Pap tests are
determined simultaneously. There might be some unobserved factors that drive both decisions
thereby raising endogeneity issues, potentially leading to biased estimates. To deal with this
issue, we exploit the fact that the HPV vaccination is recommended for women younger than age

3

26 years old, and that the probability of vaccination should change significantly around that age.
We use this cut-off point at recommended age to construct a fuzzy regression discontinuity to
identify more clearly the effect of the HPV vaccine on testing.
The results indicate that vaccine initiation is positively associated with short-term
probability of participation in Pap tests even after controlling for potential endogeneity. This
might be the result of increased awareness that people acquire at the time of vaccination. The
estimates that ignore the potential endogeneity will result in under-estimating the true effect of
the vaccine initiation on the decision to participate in Pap tests.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the second section provides a background
on recommendations for Pap test and HPV vaccination. The third section describes the data and
methodology. The fourth section presents the results, while the fifth section analyses the
sensitivity of the results to different specifications. Finally, the sixth section concludes.

2. Background
Participation in regular Pap tests has decreased the incidence and mortality rates of
cervical cancer in the past 40 years causing cervical cancer to no longer be the leading cause of
cancer death for women in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013).
U.S. cervical cancer incidence rates and mortality rates decreased by 75% and 74%
(respectively) in the 50 years following the introduction of cervical cytology in 1949 (Howe et
al., 2006). The most successful strategy in cervical cancer prevention is population-based Papsmear screening programs. The introduction of screening programs in unscreened populations
can result in a 60-90% reduction in cervical cancer rates within three years after implementation
(Saslow et al., 2002).

4

Pap tests were recommended on an annual basis, for women in the 21 to 29 age group,
and once every two to three years for older women. In March 2012, the United States Preventive
Services Task Force published new cervical cancer screening guidelines which increased the
recommended screening intervals to once every three years in most circumstances (National
Cancer Institute, 2014).
In March 2007, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) published its
recommendation for the HPV vaccine (Roblin et al., 2014). The HPV vaccine is recommended
for routine vaccination at the age of eleven or twelve. ACIP also recommends HPV vaccination
for females up to age 26 not vaccinated previously (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2010). 1 Vaccination was not initially recommended for women over the age, given that the
relatively older women were not included in early clinical trials for vaccines. As a result, the
FDA could not approve the vaccines for the older age group (American Cancer Society, 2014).
Although subsequent studies claimed that Gardasil could help protect women between the ages
of 27 and 45 against infection and disease from certain HPV types (Skinner et al., 2008). After
reviewing the data, the FDA concluded that the vaccine did not offer sufficient protective benefit
to these women to justify a change in the recommended age. While women 27 years of age are
legally allowed to get an HPV injection, they may do so only at their physician’s discretion.
Since this is considered off-label use, most health insurance plans would not cover it, suggesting
that both practice norms and costs act as barriers at this relatively late age. 2 The vast majority of

1

ACIP also recommends the quadrivalent vaccine for boys ages eleven to twelve.

2

The drug company wholesale price for either vaccine is around $130 or $140, and a full sequence of the vaccine
can cost around $390. Adding ancillary costs, this is a considerably expensive product that can significantly affect
the probability of vaccination for off-label users above the recommended age.

women get vaccinated prior to age 26; however, about 13% of women were older than 26 at the
time of their first injection. 3

3. Data and Methodology
We use the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for this study. The NHIS is a crosssectional household interview designed to collect information for monitoring the health of the
United States population. The core of the database contains four major components: Household,
Family, Sample Adult, and Sample Child. The Household component collects limited
demographic information on all the individuals living in a particular house. The Family
component verifies and collects additional demographic information on each member from each
family in the household and also collects information on health status, illness and injuries, and
access to healthcare and utilization. From each family in the NHIS, one sample adult and one
sample child are randomly selected and detailed health related information on each is collected.
The Sample Adult component of the NHIS contains information on Pap test screening history
and HPV vaccination. We use the Sample Adult database and use other components to match
socioeconomic information for each individual in the sample to construct our database. We
exclude the year 2008 from the analysis, since the vaccines were not approved for women older
than 26 years old until middle of that year. We also exclude year 2009 in which information
about vaccination and Pap tests is missing. The final sample consists of information from years
2010-2014.
To estimate the effect of HPV vaccination on the decision to participate in Pap tests, we
begin by estimating:
3

The National Household Interview Survey (NHIS) started collecting information about the age of respondent at the
first HPV "shot” only as of 2013. 87% of women had their first HPV shot at ages younger than 26 years old, and
13% had their first shot at ages older than 26.

6

stpapijt=f(α+ γj + δt +β1Xijt+β2∙(hpvijt)+εijt)

(1)

We estimate this equation using a probit model. stpapijt represents whether a person had a
Pap test in the past 12 months (hereafter referred to as a short-run Pap test). 4 The variable hpv is
a dummy variable which is equal to one when a respondent has initiated the sequence of HPV
vaccination (dose≥1) in the past and otherwise zero. γj is a vector of census region dummy
variable that captures time-invariant factors that cause the outcomes to be different between
census regions 5. δt is a vector of year dummies that captures the variation in outcomes in
different years that are common among regions. Xijt is a vector of control covariates. It includes
controls for age, race, marital status, employment status, health insurance coverage status,
citizenship status, and whether a person has ever taken an HIV test. Table 1 presents the
definition and coding of each variable.
It is important to point out that the decision to initiate the vaccine might be correlated
with some unobserved factors that can influence the decision to participate in Pap tests
simultaneously. Failing to control for the interdependence between these two decisions will lead
to biased and inconsistent estimates. The direction of the bias is unclear. For example, people
placing a higher value on health might seek both preventive options and treat them as
complements. On the other hand, it is possible that people with limited access to regular
healthcare might find the vaccination a more convenient method of protection that requires less
effort and fewer follow ups.

4

The NHIS reports Pap test uptake consistently only for the past 12 months. Measures of Pap uptake over longer
look back periods are not collected for most years in our data. This restricts our statistical power to study the effect
of HPV vaccination on uptake of Pap test in the longer time spans.
5

It includes dummies for West, Midwest, Northeast, and South census regions. State of residence is not identifiable
with the public use databases.

7

A plausible strategy for identifying exogenous variation in HPV vaccine initiation is to
exploit the knowledge of the rules determining the treatment. In particular, the availability of a
known cut-off point in treatment assignment provides an opportunity to construct a regression
discontinuity design. In principle, regression discontinuity compares the average outcome for
units just left and right of the discontinuity point within a very small interval (bandwidth) around
the cut-off point. Increasing the interval around the cut-off point might result in biased estimates
of the treatment, specifically when the assignment variable is related to the outcome conditional
on treatment assignment. A more flexible variant of the model defines the probability of
treatment receipt as a function of one or more continuous assignment variables (van der Klaauw,
2008).
CDC recommends the vaccine for women younger than 26 years old (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). Therefore, one might expect the probability of
vaccination to be discontinuous at this cut-off point. We use this cut-off point to construct a
fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) around this point. In a fuzzy design, treatment assignment
depends on k in a stochastic manner, but one in which the propensity of treatment (Pr (T=1|k)) is
� (van der Klaauw, 2008). We use the discontinuity as an
again known to have a discontinuity at 𝐾

instrumental variable for treatment status. This new estimate can be summarized by a bivariate
probit model as follows:

hpvijt= 1(α + α1 Ki +α2 (coveredi) +α3 (Ki*coveredi) +α4 (Xijt)+ γj +δt + uijt >0) 2(a)
stpapijt= 1(φ + φ1 Ki+ φ2 (Ki*coveredi) + φ3 (Xijt)+φ4 (hpvijt) + θj+ τt+ εijt >0)

2(b)

  0  1 ρ  
ε 
  | Z  N  ,

u 
0  ρ 1

8

In equations 2(a) and 2(b), γj and θj are census region dummies, and δt and τt are year dummies.
We normalize age at the cut-off point by defining variable Ki=age-ci, where ci is the cut-off
point, and age is shifted so that the discontinuity occurs at Ki=0 (Ki is the running variable). The
validity of the RD estimates depends on whether the polynomial order of the running variable
provides an adequate description of the treatment variable (Angrist & Pischke, 2009). 6 We allow
the relationship between the outcomes in equations 2(a) and 2(b) and Ki to have different slopes
on either side of the discontinuity. The variable coveredi is a dummy variable that is equal to one
if Ki<0 (person is in the recommended age of vaccination) and zero otherwise. The remaining
variables are defined as in equation 1. The results from the fuzzy regression discontinuity design
can be interpreted as a local estimator in two ways. First, because it requires limiting the sample
to a subset of the population near the cut-off point, the treatment effect can only be identified for
the sub-population around that point. Second, in this neighborhood, the treatment effect is only
identified for the compliers, namely those would either initiate the vaccination if they are in the
covered age group, or would not initiate the vaccination otherwise (Imbens & Lemieux, 2008).
As long as the order of polynomial in the running variable and data bandwidth around the cutoff
point are the same for the first and second stage outcomes, estimation of φ4 in equation 2(b) is
identical to an instrumental variable approach. 7
As previously noted, the ACIP recommendation for HPV vaccination published in March
2007 stated that the vaccine should be delivered for routine vaccination for females aged eleven
6

The optimal polynomial order is determined informally by visualizing the unadjusted relationship between running
variable and the vaccine initiation status. As a robustness check, we allow equations 2(a) and 2(b) to have different
polynomial orders.

7

In theory, 2-stage least squares (2SLS) should yield similar results as the bivariate probit; however, given its
properties, the 2SLS is likely to yield biased estimates in small samples. Since we need to restrict our analysis
sample to a narrow bandwidth around the cut-off point, we did not opt for this model. Moreover, non-linear models
fit these data better.

and twelve, and for women up to age 26 not previously vaccinated. HPV vaccine is delivered in
three doses over the course of six months, and as a result, respondents who were younger than 26
in September 2007 (younger than 25.5 years of age at the time of the recommendation) fall into
the recommended age group. We compare this group to those individuals who turned 27 by
March 2007. 8 In our main analysis, we restrict the sample to 1.5 years on either side of the cutoff points.
This approach explicitly models endogeneity through the correlation parameter ρ between
ε and u, and it indicates endogeneity when it is different from zero. Note that Z is the vector of
discontinuity and exogenous variables. We impose bivariate normal distribution on the error
term following Greene (2007). We restrict the sample to an interval of 1.5 years before and after
the cut-off point in order to have a small interval around the cut-off point with a sufficiently
large number of observations. There is a visible discontinuity in the probability of vaccination
around the cut-off point.
The variable stpap is a dummy variable which is equal to one when a person had a Pap
test in the past 12 months, and zero otherwise. The variable hpv is equal to one when a person
had at least one dose of HPV vaccine anytime in the past, and zero otherwise. Our identification
strategy is based on comparing women who were 24-25.5 years old in March 2007 (issuance date
of the HPV vaccine guidelines) to women who were in the 27-28.5 age range at that point in
time. We chose our study period so that the youngest women in our study are 27 (24 in March
2007) by the time of the first survey (year 2010), while the oldest are 35.5 (28.5 in March 2007)
in the last survey (year 2014). Given the fact that the vast majority of women vaccinated, about

8

The original recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) implied that women one day after their
26th birthday are excluded from the recommended age group. However, some insurance plans may provide coverage
for the vaccine up to the day prior to the start of the 27th birthday. Given the lack of clarity in this range, we
excluded all women ages 26 plus 1 day to 27 from the discontinuity analysis

10

87% (see footnote 3) do so prior to age 26, it is safe to assume that the majority of women in our
sample were vaccinated more than a year before this survey, and by default, years before
subsequent survey years in our data which end in 2014. Thus, the twelve-month survey lookback period for the Pap test is not an issue.
Table 2 presents the summary statistics in our final sample for women who were in the
recommended age group at the time of the recommendation (March 2007), versus those who
were not in the recommended age group at the time. The percent of women who had a Pap test in
the past 12 months and of women who initiated and completed HPV vaccination is significantly
higher among those who were in the recommended age group at the time of the recommendation.
Among control covariates, there is one noteworthy item, namely that the share of women with
health insurance is significantly higher among those who were not in the recommended age
group at the time of the recommendation.

4. Results
We begin by investigating the validity of the RD design graphically. Figure 1 shows the
local quadratic regressions of covariates on the running variable. No visible discontinuity is
observed around the cut-off point. Figure 2 shows the discontinuity in the treatment variable at
the cut-off point. There is a visible discontinuity in the probability of vaccination around the cutoff points. It indicates that people are more likely to get vaccinated if they are in the
recommended age group.
Table 3 presents the results from the baseline regression (equation 1) as well as the RD
design. The first column presents the marginal effects from the probit model without taking

11

potential endogeneity into account. The next two columns present the marginal effects from the
regression discontinuity framework along with the results from the first stage.
HPV vaccine initiation increases the probability of having a Pap test in the short run. We
find a negative bias in those estimates that ignore the endogeneity. Initiating the vaccine can
increase the probability of having a Pap test by 52 percentage points. This positive association
might be due to an increased awareness of the existence of the test happening at the time of
vaccination. Note that ρ captures the potential correlation between unobservables that determines
vaccine initiation and having a Pap test simultaneously -- ρ is negative and statistically
significant.
Although we initially have a limited number of observations in Table 3 (assumptions are
relaxed in a subsequent table), the point estimates for the instrumental variable have the expected
sign indicating that being in the recommended age group increases the probability of vaccine
initiation significantly. We also report the F-statistics for the excluded IV from the first stage in
order to provide a measure to test for weak identification. The excluded IV has an acceptable Fstatistic of around 11.
Other results in Table 3 also indicate that having any kind of health insurance can
increase the probability of having a Pap test and initiating the HPV vaccination. The point
estimates for income are also positive for both probit, and bivariate probit model, but only
statistically significant at 10% level for the bivariate probit model. An HIV test is also positively
correlated with both having a Pap test and initiating the HPV vaccine in all the specifications. If

12

an individual needs to be tested for a sexually transmitted disease, it is more likely for that
person to take precautionary measures for other STDs. 9
Altogether, we do not find any evidence of ex-ante moral hazard; to the contrary, we find
a positive association between getting vaccinated and having a Pap test in the past year. This is
despite the fact that the recommendation for HPV vaccination was changed to every three years
rather than annually. Note that reducing the frequency of recommended testing in the new
guidelines implies that the estimated moral hazard effect is downward biased; that is, longer
intervals between tests lower the probability of utilizing the routine preventive care in the later
years independently of any behavioral effects. However, the guidelines can also have an opposite
effect by reducing the (opportunity) cost of routine testing. 10 To address this, we perform
separately, analyses for the periods between 2010-2012 and 2013-2014 as well as the pooled
sample. The parameter estimates of HPV were stable across the two sub-samples. In the 20132014 period, the estimated coefficient falls short of statistical significance at the conventional
levels (P-value=0.12) and the F-stat from the first stage is lower. We attribute the loss of power
to sample attrition (n= 1,829 in the 2013-14, compared with n=3,832 in the pooled data) and to

9

This variable is likely to be endogenous since a more health conscious person might have both HIV tests, and
vaccinate against HPV. Dropping this variable from regressions will not change the results. These results are
available upon request.

To see this, we modify the expected utility framework in Ehrlich and Becker (1972) and Dave and Kaestner
(2009), to include two preventive services, vaccines (v), and tests (r). Accordingly

The impact of the first term is negative given that the vaccine lowers the marginal product of routine preventative

the fact that the proportion of women above recommended age group who got vaccinated grew
over time. Given the stability of the relevant parameters over time, we opted to report results
from the pooled sample only. However, the full set of results is available upon request.
Increased participation in Pap tests after HPV vaccination might be due to an increased
awareness at the time of vaccination. Despite findings from clinical trials that found the vaccine
to be safe and effective, perceived safety vaccine was low (Brewer & Fazekas, 2007). There
were some rumors on the internet that claimed HPV vaccination increases the risk of
precancerous lesions if a person had already been exposed to HPV 16, and 18 prior to
vaccination. 11 As a result, a person might decide to have a Pap test after vaccination to avoid any
possible adverse outcomes. Moreover, long term safety records of the vaccine were unknown at
the time the recommendation was published. This might have led physicians to continue
recommending Pap tests to their patient even around the time of vaccination.
It is important to point out that regression discontinuity results can be interpreted as the
local average treatment effect only for the sub-population near the cut-off point. Fuzzy
regression discontinuity restricts the sub-population even further to that of compliers at this value
of the covariate. Generalizing the results as population average treatment effect requires strong
assumptions justifying extrapolation to other sub-populations (Imbens & Wooldridge, 2007a).
We explore a variety of assumptions and their effects in the next section.

5. Sensitivity Analysis
We found that the age recommendation for the HPV vaccine caused a discontinuity in the
probability of HPV vaccination. To verify that this association was not spurious, our first
11

14

robustness check was to repeat the analysis using a common vaccine for which guidelines in the
cervical cancer setting should not be relevant. We identified the flu vaccine as such a case;
additionally, the flu vaccine is recommended annually at all ages. Thus, we did not anticipate any
difference in the probability of this particular vaccine on either side of the cutoff. We ran a probit
model of having a flu vaccination in the past year on the explanatory variables and discontinuity
dummy. The estimated coefficient was small and highly insignificant; suggesting the observed
difference in the probability of HPV vaccination is truly associated with the recommendation. 12
Next, we investigate how sensitive the parametric estimates are to alternative and more
flexible specifications. To implement this, we added different combinations of polynomial orders
of running variables to the Pap test and the HPV vaccine initiation equations (van der Klaauw,
2008). In Table 4, we report the estimates of HPV vaccine initiation from the bivariate probit
framework, as well as the coefficients of the discontinuity variable, the correlation parameter ρ,
and the F-stat from the first stage. The results are firmly consistent with the previous findings
indicating that the HPV vaccine initiation will increase the probability of the short-run Pap test.
In another set of robustness checks we alter the bandwidth around the cut-off point. A
smaller interval will decrease the risk of misspecification bias, but it necessarily comes with a
loss in efficiency as sample size declines. Panel A of Table 5 presents the results from using
intervals shorter or longer than our base case of 1.5 years above or below the cut-off point. The
estimated coefficients of HPV initiation remain positive in all the specifications, and relatively
stable in magnitude. Moreover, the results are statistically significant in all cases, with the

dummy variable which is equal to one if a person had a flu shot in the past 12 months, and zero otherwise. As
expected, the marginal effect of the discontinuity variable (α2) in this model was negligible and statistically
insignificant, (α2 = 0.005, P value=0.845). All other coefficients were similar to the HPV model.

smallest. Taken together, the results from the sensitivity analysis are consistent with our main
findings; they do not provide any evidence of moral hazard.
Finally, to test the sensitivity of our results to the distributional assumptions in the
bivariate probit model, we reran our analysis using a two-stage residual inclusion, that is
appropriate for non-linear outcomes yet that imposes far fewer distributional assumptions.
Noting that our endogenous variable is binary (HPV vaccine uptake), estimating the residuals
from the first stage is more complicated than in the case of a continuous variable. We closely
followed Imbens and Wooldridge (2007b) to construct generalized residuals. In the first stage,
we estimated a probit model of vaccine initiation on the explanatory variables and excluded
instruments (discontinuity). We then calculated generalized error based on the formula below:

� ijt)/ɸ (ℎ𝑝𝑣
� ijt))]-(1-hpvijt)* [φ(−ℎ𝑝𝑣
� ijt)/ɸ (−ℎ𝑝𝑣
� ijt))] (3)
Generalized error= (hpvijt)*[φ(ℎ𝑝𝑣
φ is the pdf of a standard normal variable, and ɸ is the cdf of standard normal
distribution. In the second stage, we ran a probit model for having Pap test in the past 12 months
on a set of explanatory variables, hpv vaccine initiation, and generalized error estimated from the
first stage. The results are reported in the first column of panel B of Table 5. We restrict the
sample to 1.5 years around the cut-off point, as in our main analysis. The results are very similar
to those we obtained from the bivariate probit model.
We also use the second definition of HPV vaccine uptake, namely for those who
completed the entire sequence of vaccination (three or more HPV injections). Clearly, at any
given time, there are fewer people who finish the full course of vaccination in comparison with
those who initiated it, resulting in a smaller variation in the endogenous variable. However, it is

16

conceivable that the perceived risk may be different among those who complete the full regimen
of the vaccine in comparison with those who do not complete it. To explore this issue, we use the
framework in equation 2, with the baseline 1.5-year bandwidth on either side of the cut-off point.
These results are added to Panel B of Table 5. The estimated coefficient for vaccine completion
on HPV vaccine is positive, comparable in magnitude to that found in our main analyses, and
economically meaningful; however, it was not statistically significant (P-value=0.16). We
attribute the lack of significance in this result to the limited variation in our endogenous
regressor. 13

6. Conclusion
We posit that vaccination can influence risk perception in people who receive a vaccine,
causing them to reduce preventive efforts against related disease, thereby exhibiting ex-ante
moral hazard. In this study, we specifically look at the behavioral response to HPV vaccination
in terms of participation in Pap tests. Although HPV vaccination can protect against certain
types of HPV and thereby reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, the protection granted by the
vaccine is partial and it is not considered a perfect substitute for diagnostic screening using the
Pap test.
Empirically, we exploit the established age-specific guidelines for receiving the vaccine
to construct a regression discontinuity design for the Pap test decision. Because the cut-off point
at the recommended age it non-deterministic (women are able to choose vaccination rather than
being assigned to it), we opt for the fuzzy discontinuity design, rather than it’s more commonly
used “sharp” counterpart. Accordingly, we simultaneously account for both the vaccine and test

13

Restricting the sample to the 1.5 year intervals around the cut-off point yielded 344 people who initiated the
vaccination, but only 161 people who completed the full course.

17

probabilities. Note that the validity of regression discontinuity results requires that on any given
treatment level (vaccinated or not vaccinated), the relationship between the outcome (Pap test)
and the running variable (age) be locally continuous. This assumption might be violated when
there is a possibility of misreporting in the running variable; however age is unlikely to pose this
problem.
Due to the sample size available to us in the 2010-2014 NHIS data for young adult
females, we opted for a relatively wide bandwidth around the cut-off age for the vaccine.
However, in sensitivity analyses with narrower bandwidth s, trading off smaller samples for a
more clearly specified quasi-experiment, yielded similar results; our results were similarly robust
to variety of specifications test. This lends greater confidence in our overall finding.
Combined, our results provide no evidence of ex-ante moral hazard. Rather, we find that
individuals who were in the recommended age group at the time the recommendation went into
effect were more likely to receive an HPV vaccine compared to those who were not in the
recommended age group (about seven percentage point), and those who had vaccinated were
more likely to have a Pap test in the past twelve months (about 52 percentage points). We noted
results from regression discontinuity models may not be generalized for the entire population,
but they provide a valid interpretation as local average treatment effects around the cut-off point.
We speculate that having the vaccine causes patients to have more interactions with health care
systems around cervical cancer prevention, thereby increasing awareness of the need for
continued vigilance. This may be the subject of further behavioral research.
