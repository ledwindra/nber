Testing Long—Run Productivity Models for the
Canadian and U.S. Agricultural Sectors

ABSTRACT

This paper discusses a portion of our work linking data on the agriculture
sector in the United States and Canada. The purpose of this work is to explore
the evolution of gains in agricultural productivity in the two countries during
the post-WWII period. Comparable data has been developed for each country and a
series of tests have been applied about the nature of the long—run production
sector. These tests are designed to evaluate the alternate possible structures
of shifts in the long-run technology over time.
There is considerable evidence in both countries that the long—run shifts
have been Hicks Neutral in models that use gross, not net, output measures. The
reverse is true for the net output models. The use of the conventional net output measures is strongly rejected. However there is evidence, in both
countries, in support of the hypothesis that separability of a type that is
similar to, but weaker, than real-value added is not rejected.

TESTING LONG RUN PRODUCTIVITY MODELS FOR THE
CANADIAN AND U.S. AGRICULTURAL SECTORS

Introduction*

Much debate has

surfaced

over

the use

of gross versus net productivity

measures to characterize the 'owth in the agricultural sectors. The AAEA
Task Force on .ieasuring Agricultural Productivity concluded that "the best

approacn Etc productivity measurement is the 'oss output/total input
concept that the USDA currently uses in terms of clearness of meaning and
applicability to concerns that people have when they ask about agricultural

productivity." (USDA (1980), page 27). However the issue is much deeper
than what appears to afford the most easily understood yardstick, and
relates to what each measure implies concerning the underlying structure of

the agricultural sectors. There is a clearly defined linkage between the
type of measure of productivity growth and the production structure.

Furthermore to suggest that one measure is preferred over another is to
implicitly assume that the structure implied by the preferred measure more

accurately reflects the "true" structure of the sector. Alternatively, one
can offer the following rationale: if we can statistically accept the
underlying structural restrictions implied by either a ross or net index
measure,

Section

one begins with a description of our basic long run model of

production that changes with time. Restrictions on this general model are
derived

which conform to the two primary models of total factor

productivity——gross and

net

output measures. These restrictions take the

form of separability restrictions on various subgroups of inputs and time.

These

restricted models are arranged in sequences that form the bases for

nested hypothesis testing.

In

order to

compare our productivity models with explicit structural

models of the technology, we rely on the theoretical results developed y
Diewert (1976) and others. These are briefly reviewed in section two.
Section three uses the translog production technology with technical change
to provide the set of parameter restrictions for testing alternative
models.

The net output total factor productivity model is rejected in both the U.S.

1. Technical Change and Productivity
Consider a production process that uses three inputs to produce one
output represented by the production function,

with inputs (K), labor (L) and materials (M). Technical progress is

specified

in very general form in (1.1) and we proceed to restrict its form

to yield productivity indexes. To be comparable to index nbers, we impose
the

restriction that the production function is linearly homogenous.
Our testable

restrictions take the form of imposing a variety of

separability conditions on (1.1). Weak separability will be used wherever

possible. Weak and strong separability are equivalent in certain cases and
in a few places we are concerned explicitly with strong separability.

As indicated in the introduction, there

In each case, either technical change (1.3) or

materials (1.2) is weakly separable from capital and labor. Adding further
restrictions to (1.2) arid (1.3) respectively, we have,

materials: Q =

technical: Q =

It is easy to show that materials separability (1.4) is a more restrictive

form of partial materials separability. The same is true for (1.5) relative

to (1.3). Materials separability can be further constrained to result in

meures of net output factor productivity. Similarly, technical
separacility is part of a series of restrictions that are related to 'oss

factor productivity. The steps leading to these two major sequences

2. Functional Forms and Index Numbers
This section relates Diewert's (1976) theoretical results to our

particular problem. Diewert defined the notions of exact and superlative
index numbers. A quantity index formula is exact for a particular
functional form if the ratio of
identically

the outputs

between any two periods is

equal to the index of' outputs. Among the set of all exact index

numbers, the superlative index number formulas are exact for a functional

number formula that is superlative for the functional form that is used

in

our estimation of the production technology.
The Translog form will be used to estimate the production technology.
In order to limit the disparities in our results that arise due to the
selection of functional forms, the index number formula for the direct

measurement of productivity must be superlative for the Translog. Diewert
has shown that the Tornqvist discrete approximation to the Divisia index is

superlative

for the linearly homogeneous Translog function. The empirical

work that follows will make use of

this relationship.

Quantity indexes are functions of

the

prices and quantities of the

components. Implicit in Diewert's theorems that relate index numbers to
functional forms is the assumption of competitive behavior. This is
necessary in order to eliminate prices in moving from the index numbers to
the functional forms which do not contain the prices.6
Both econometric estimates and the index numbers reported later in the

paper are based on the competitive behavior assumption. Any differences in
the results from the measurement of productivity and technical change will

statistical assumptions that will lead to differences in the estimates.

partial technical separability the following procedure is followed. The
restricted function (3.24) must be expanded and the first and second order

derivatives calculated. Since these derivatives correspond to the
parameters of the Translog form, any relationships among the derivatives
implies restrictions on the Translog function.

productivity and TFP growth equals the growth in factor intensity. The
latter is a weighted sum of the growth in the capital—labor and

materials—labor ratio. In both periods, the growth in Canadian TF?
exceeded the American growth by roughly one percent.

In Canada labor productivity growth was being driven by the

contribution of TFP growth which was roughly fifty percent. In the U.S.,
labor productivity growth was more heavily driven by factor substitution,

i.e. the growth in factor intensity. This is particularly true in the
1960s. The U.S. decline in labor productivity growth during the 19705 was
entirely due to the decline in the growth in factor intensity, as evidenced
by U.S. TFP growth

being

higher in the 1970s than in the 1960s.

The growth in productivity is due to many factors but may be measured

by the difference in the rates of growth of outputs and inputs. Table 2
provides information on the average annual growth rates of outputs and

inputs. In both countries, aggregate agriculture output has grown slowly.

This was particularly true during the 1960s. During the

Canada's

second period,

output grew at a much faster rate than in the U.S.

In both countries, aggregate agriculture inputs have been fairly

stable during the 1962—1978 period. However, this constant aggregate input

level disguises the large shifts in particular inputs. Labor inputs have
been declining rapidly in both countries. This decline was

very

We

turn now to a discussion of the alternative estimates of tne

sections 1 and 3.

Estimation of

Restrictions

the Translog Production Technology and Tests for
on Technical Change

The translog production function (3.2) and the corresponding share
equations for capital and labor were estimated as a system of three

equations, subject to the linear homogeneity constraints (3.3). The
estimation technique is described in Berndt and coauthors (19714). The

parameter estimates for this unconstrained model are provided in Table 3i1
In subsequent discussions this model is referred to as the maintained
hypothesis model.
Since the paper is primarily concerned with productivity comparisons,

only the parameters that relate to technical change are discussed. In
Canada, the share of labor has decreased due to technical change, while the

share of capital has increased. A similar pattern is observed for the U.S.
For both countries the effect of technical change on the share of materials

is imprecisely estimated. Thus the hypothesis of neutral technical bias
for materials could not be rejected. One might also note the lack of a

16

significant relationship between materials and the other primary inputs

'lm' km
The two parameters,

and

indicate

the inward shifting of the

isaquants. This is occurring at a substantially faster pace in Canada

compared to the U.S. Furthermore, the rate of change, 8 is four—times
'eater in Canada.
The tests for tne alternative forms of technical change are based on

the likelihood ratio test. Defining A as the ratio of the maximum of the
likelihood function in the constrained and unconstrained models, the test
statistic, —2 log A, has an asympotic

distribution. The deees of

freedom equal the number of restrictions. The critical values of the
test statistic for various levels of significance and number of
restrictions are given in Table 4.

In section 1, we discussed two major sequences which

theoretically

leads to measures of 'oss and net total factor productivity. We proceed
to test each sequence independently, as well as testing each hypothesis

independently. Our rationale is as follows. Consider the 'oss output
Hicks neutral technical change hypothesis (1.6). This can be tested as
part of our nested sequence.

If we reject partial technical separability

this implies that we would also' reject Hick neutrality since it is part of

the nested sequence. However, there may be other testing sequences that
would theoretically lead to (1.6), and would not reject Hicks neutrality.
Thus we will present the sequential test results as well as the direct test

results for both types of Hicks neutrality. Following the analyses for the
two major sequences, we proceed to test the primary input jelly sequences,
and the real value added hypothesis.12

for oss output Hicks neutrality are less consistent. The direct

tests (5.1) were not rejected for either country. The sequential test
results do not conflict for the U.S., but do conflict for Canada (although

the rejection is weak). To have an invariant index of productivity, some
version of Hicks neutrality is required (Hulten, 1973). Since we do not
reject gross output Hicks neutrality f or either Canada or the U.S., this

suggests placing some reliance on the gross output productivity indexes for
the U.S. and Canadian agricultural sectors reported in Table 1.

Primary Input Jelly:
As

indicated

in section 3,

the

primary input jelly hypothesis links the

and 'oss output sequences. It requires the joint imposition of the
restrictions for partial materials and partial technical separability. We

net

test the hypothesis of primary input jelly
hypothesis, and sequentially as

directly against the maintained

shown in figure 2.

The direct test of primary input jelly hypothesis for the U.S. and
Canada yielded the following results.

The hypotheses is reject in both countries, at the .05 level

of

si&iificance.

The sequential testing leads to somewhat different results. For U.S.,
our earlier results lead to acceptance of both partial technical separ-

ability and partial materials separability. Conditional on eacn of these
hypotheses, we test for primary input jelly. The appropriate test
statistics are:

(b) Conditional on partial materials

3.960

For one restriction, (5.9a) is not rejected at the 0.05 levels of
sigr.ificance; (5.9b)

is not

rejected at the 0.025

level of significance.

Thus

the

sequential tests conflict with the direct test of primary input

jelly for the U.S.
For Canada, the appropriate test statistics are:

alternative sequence, partial materials separability was accepted, but

Real Value Added:

Although real value added functions are not the bases for productivity
measurement

in the agricultural sectors, they are important for comparisons

of productivitj rates with other sectors of the U.S. and Canadian
economies. Our final set of tests for the long run production structure
deals with the real value added function.

The strong nonrejection of flartial materials separability (5.5) in
both countries lends some support for a real value added function that
includes

technical change, T. Furthermore, the acceptance of materials

(5:6) in both countries supports the argument that technical

The results of (5.9b) and (510b) provide weaker support for real

Summary

As we noted in the introduction, the purpose of this paper is to test

alternative models of productivity. The long run models more closely
replicate
total

the underlying economic structure for

index nuber measures of

factor productivity. We do not wish to argue that these models can

provide anything but limited ex post information about technical change.

Utilizing the long run production function franework, we failed to
reject the hypotheses of gross output Hicks neutrality in both Canada and
the

United States. The sequential test results for Canada, however, did

23

lead

to rejecting prtial technical separability and tnereoy rejecting

gross output Hicks neutrality. The net output Hicks neutrality hypothesis
is rejected in both countries. These results lend support to the use of

productivity indexes to measure
The

total factor productivity.
direct tests for the "primary input jelly" and the real value added
gross output

hypotheses are also rejected for the U.S. and Canada.

The sequential test results support a number of alternative
hypotheses.

not

Partial materials separability and materials separability are

rejected. The latter hypotheses relate technical change to the primary

inputs, in a norineutral manner. Models that ignore tecnnical change
(partial technical separability and

the

sequential tests for gross output

neutrality and for primary input jelly) are supported by the U.S.
data. These sequential results lend support for the variety of partial
production models that have been used in agricultural studies.

The Canadian a'iculture data have been taken from a recent
productivity

study by Brinan and Prentice (1983). There are three basic

changes that we have made to maintain consistency with the U.S. database.
First, the stock of inventories is not treated as part of the production

process. That is, we have taken a narrow flow basis for the production

process. Brjncaan and Prentice include inventories as an input. Second,
we have ag'egated the data using Divisia indexes with service prices as

the weights. As for the U.S. data, the service prices do not include
capital gains. Finally, we have re—allocated some of the inputs so that
