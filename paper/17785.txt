Alternative Cash Transfer Delivery Mechanisms: Impacts on Routine Preventative Health
Clinic Visits in Burkina Faso

NBER Working Paper No. 17785

ABSTRACT
We conducted a unique randomized experiment to estimate the impact of alternative cash transfer
delivery mechanisms on household demand for routine preventative health services in rural Burkina
Faso. The two-year pilot program randomly distributed cash transfers that were either conditional
or unconditional and were given to either mothers or fathers. Families under the conditional cash transfer
schemes were required to obtain quarterly child growth monitoring at local health clinics for all children
under 60 months old. There were no such requirements under the unconditional programs. Compared
with control group households, we find that conditional cash transfers significantly increase the number
of preventative health care visits during the previous year, while unconditional cash transfers do not
have such an impact. For the conditional cash transfers, transfers given to mothers or fathers showed
similar magnitude beneficial impacts on increasing routine visits.

1. Introduction
Poor health is widespread among children in low-income countries. Often, such ill health is
coupled with poor access to health care, either because of supply-side or demand-side
constraints. These poor health outcomes negatively affect physical growth and cognitive
development, with potential long-term consequences. For example, children who are in poor
health are less likely to enroll in school, or enter school later, and when they enroll they tend to
perform worse than children in good health (Moock and Leslie 1986; Brooker, Hall, and Bundy
1999; Glewwe, Jacoby, and King 2001). This in turn affects productivity later in life (Dasgupta
1993; Strauss and Thomas 1995; Schultz 2001). It is estimated that illness incidence and other
health risks prevent approximately 200 million children in low income countries from reaching
their full potential in cognitive development (Grantham-McGregor et al. 2007). Obviously,
identifying mechanisms that could improve health outcomes among children will have large
payoffs, not only at the individual level, but also in term of overall economic progress as well.
Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs are now one of the most popular government
welfare interventions in developing countries.1 These programs transfer resources to poor
households conditional on the family taking measures to increase the health and human capital of
their children (predominantly enrolling their children in school and taking them for regular
health care visits). Unconditional cash transfer (UCT) programs do not impose these
conditionality constraints. CCT programs represent a “top-down” approach in which outside
organizations decide what is best for poor children and provide incentives to their parents to
achieve these objectives. In contrast, UCT programs assume that, once a budget constraint is
1

Numerous countries in Latin America, as well as in Asia have implemented such programs (Fiszbein and Schady
2009). In Africa, several CCT pilot programs (in South Africa and Kenya) have been implemented but focus
exclusively on orphans and HIV households and have not yet been rigorously evaluated, while other pilot programs
(in Malawi and Morocco) are currently being evaluated (see Baird, McIntosh, and Ozler 2011 for information about
the Malawi evaluation) but focus mainly on educational outcomes or adolescent children.

relaxed, parents are in a better position to make appropriate decisions regarding their child’s
human capital. CCT programs are also more costly per recipient to administer than UCT
programs because of the costs associated with monitoring conditions. Unconditional cash
transfers act through increased income, so that health outcomes should improve as long as the
income elasticity of demand for health is positive and marginal productivity of health care is
positive (Parker and Wong, 1998). Mounting evidence shows both types of transfers improve
child health outcomes (for CCTs in Colombia (Attanasio, Gomez, Heredia, and Vera-Hernandez
2005), Ecuador (Paxson and Schady 2008), Nicaragua (Maluccio and Flores 2005; Macours,
Schady, and Vakis 2008); and for UCTs in South Africa (Case and Deaton 1998; Case,
Hosegood, and Lund 2005; Duflo 2003)), but the evidence on which mechanisms–conditionality
or income effects- are playing a role in driving the impacts is more limited.2
In this paper, we present evidence of the impacts of a unique cash transfer pilot program
in rural Burkina Faso, the Nahouri Cash Transfers Pilot Project (NCTPP), on the take-up of
routine preventative health clinic visits. The NCTPP incorporated a random experimental design
to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the following four cash transfer programs targeting poor
households in rural Burkina Faso: conditional cash transfers given to fathers, conditional cash
transfers given to mothers, unconditional cash transfers given to fathers, and unconditional cash
transfers given to mothers. Our evaluation focuses on health utilization for children 0 to 59
months old, in particular their visits to health clinics for routine preventative care. Even by
African standards, child health outcomes in Burkina Faso are considered to be poor. In 2003,
2

However, not all impact studies show consistently positive results for these programs, and differences tend to
depend on the specific details about the cash transfer program, the age range of the child studied, the evaluation
method, and whether the evaluations were measuring short or medium term impacts. Even for outcomes that were
directly conditioned upon, such as preventative health clinic visits, evaluations for Chile (Galasso 2006), Ecuador
(Paxson and Schady 2008), and Nicaragua (Maluccio and Flores 2005) show no significant change in the number of
visits to the health clinic for preventative reasons, while there were positive impacts on routine health check-ups in
Colombia (Attanasio et al. 2005), Honduras (Morris, Flores, Olinto, and Medina 2004), and Jamaica (Levy and Ohls
2007).

38.7 percent of children under 59 months were 2 standard deviations below the reference
population for height-for-age, 18.6 percent for weight-for-height and 37.7 percent for weight-forage (INSD/ORC Macro, 2004). Similarly, 38 percent of children in that age group experienced
some form of fever or respiratory infection in the two weeks preceding the national Demographic
and Health Survey. Among children who had been ill, only 30 percent received any care from a
health professional (INSD/ORC Macro, 2004).
We find that children under age five in families that received conditional cash transfers
have 0.43 more visits to the health clinic for routine preventative care during the previous year
compared to children in control households, a 49 percent increase compared to the mean in the
control group. We find similar magnitude beneficial impacts for children in families where the
mother or father received conditional cash transfers, indicating that at least when the transfers are
conditional, the gender of the cash transfer recipient is not a critical factor influencing the
frequency of routine health facility visits. In contrast, we do not find beneficial effects from
unconditional cash transfers that are given to either mothers or fathers. This highlights the point
that at least for this particular outcome of routine preventative health clinic visits, conditionality
is more important than transfer recipient gender in increasing health clinic utilization for
children.
Our experimental design has several distinctive features differentiating it from other
studies. First, we randomly test conditional and unconditional cash transfers in the same
environment, which allows us to determine whether the key factor driving impacts is an income
effect or conditionality.3 Second, unlike many cash transfer programs that pay the transfers to

3

A recent study by de Brauw and Hoddinott (2007) makes use of administrative errors in Mexico to try to untangle
how much of any observed program impact is due to the program’s income transfers and how much is due to the
conditionality forcing households to undertake specific behaviors in order to receive the funds. Baird, McIntosh and

mothers with the hope mothers will spend the money more wisely, we randomly selected
mothers or fathers to receive the payments. Hence we contribute to the long-standing question on
the effects of resources controlled by the mother or the father on a child’s human capital.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the cash transfer
pilot program as well as its experimental design and presents some descriptive statistics from the
household survey. Section 3 discusses our empirical identification strategy and Section 4
presents main results. Section 5 concludes.
2. Burkina Faso Nahouri Cash Transfer Pilot Project
2.1. Program Design
The pilot cash transfer program was conducted in Nahouri province in southern Burkina Faso,
located approximately 100 miles from the capital, Ouagadougou. The 75 villages in Nahouri
province that each have a primary school were randomly allocated to the following five groups
(see Figure 1, panel A): (i) conditional cash transfers given to the father (CCTF), (ii) conditional
cash transfers given to the mother (CCTM), (iii) unconditional cash transfers given to the father
(UCTF), (iv) unconditional cash transfers given to the mother (UCTM), and (v) a control group.
There were 15 villages in each treatment arm and in the control group. Based on our experience
with previous randomized program evaluations in Burkina Faso, as well as qualitative focus
groups we conducted in Nahouri province, we believed that transparency in the randomization
process was critical for maintaining a household’s participation in the surveys and to guarantee
the local authorities’ support. Therefore, the village-level treatment randomization took place
during a public meeting in the Nahouri provincial capital in which each village was represented
by their local leaders.

Özler (2011) also report results from a randomized experiment in Malawi comparing conditional and unconditional
cash transfers, but their target population are adolescent girls and they mainly focus on education outcomes.

5

In the next stage, in each of the 60 villages that were randomly selected to receive a cash
transfer program, all poor eligible households were present for a participatory lottery to
randomly assign those households to either receive or not receive the particular type of transfer
allocated to that village. To determine whether a household was eligible (based on their poverty
status) to take part in the lottery, immediately prior to the baseline survey, we conducted an
extended household census in every village to collect information from each household about
household living structure (cement or mud brick walls, metal or straw roof, flooring, access to
latrine), household asset ownership (plow, cart, draft animals, motorcycle, radio), whether the
head of household ever attended school, whether the household grows cotton, and whether there
was a weekly market in the village. We combined this information with a Burkina Faso
nationally representative household survey to calculate a predicted consumption level for each
household and compare that with the national poverty line to determine whether a household is
considered poor and subsequently is eligible to receive the cash transfer. Given the government
transfer program’s limited budget, in consultation with village leaders, we decided that
randomization was the fairest way to determine which poor eligible households receive a
transfer, and everyone was aware that not all poor households in a given village would be
receiving a transfer during the pilot program.
We conducted three rounds of surveys (baseline, one-year follow-up, two-year follow-up)
in June 2008, June 2009, and June 2010, interviewing all poor households eligible to receive a
transfer in each of the treatment villages and who had been randomly selected to receive the
transfer. In each of these four groups of 15 villages, we interviewed approximately 540 poor
households randomly selected to receive transfers. The control group consisted of 615 randomly

6

selected poor households that did not receive a cash transfer in the 15 control villages where no
households received cash transfers.
Among households randomly assigned to a CCT scheme, for their children under age six,
the conditions imposed were quarterly visits to the local health clinic for child growth
monitoring, while for children age seven to fifteen, the conditions were school enrollment with
an attendance rate above 90 percent each quarter. In the villages randomly assigned to
conditional cash transfers, satisfaction of the conditions was assessed using a family booklet in
which the school teachers and the health workers signed and stamped the booklet for a given
child to confirm school attendance and health visits, respectively. Further, in the CCT villages,
local village committees, which had received specific training, randomly selected 20 percent of
the booklets and verified the information reported in those with data from the school attendance
registers and the health center visits register.
For families randomly assigned to a UCT program, the mother or father received a
quarterly stipend for each child without conditions. For each child under age six, in the CCT and
UCT programs, the mother or father would receive 1000 FCFA per quarter, for a total of 4000
FCFA per year. Using the exchange rate during the 2008 baseline of 415 FCFA = $1 USD, the
annual transfer was worth approximately $9.64, which is 9 percent of household per capita
expenditures. For each child age 7 to 10 (or in grades 1 to 4), the mother or father would receive
2000 FCFA per quarter (8000 FCFA per year), while for each child age 11 to 15 (or in grades 5
or higher), the mother or father would receive 4000 FCFA per quarter (16,000 FCFA per year).4
There was no household transfer cap amount, so that each age eligible child could participate
irrespective of the composition of the family. The transfers were made in cash during a quarterly
4

To minimize child fostering in response to the program introduction and reduce any potential sample attrition (see
Akresh 2009 for evidence on the relationship between income shocks and child fostering), eligibility for cash
transfers was based only on the children present in the household at the time of the baseline survey.

visit conducted by the program staff. Cash transfers were disbursed during the academic school
year 2008-2009 (October 2008 to June 2009) and 2009-2010 (October 2009 to June 2010). The
program design assumes that each of the treatment groups would receive equal amounts of
resources per capita over the two-year transfer program period if households randomly allocated
to the conditional cash transfers fully satisfied the conditions.
Meetings were also organized between the central government and the provincial health
and education authorities to ensure the full participation of school administrators (principals and
teachers) and health administrators (doctors and nurses) in the program. This included ensuring
their role in verifying the cash transfer conditionality. However, no other changes were made to
and no additional government funds were provided for the supply of education or health services.
2.2. Descriptive Statistics
Households in the Nahouri region are predominantly subsistence farmers growing sorghum and
groundnuts and have mean annual per capita expenditures of approximately $111 USD.
Summary statistics in Table 1 show that on average, there are 7.0 members in each household, of
whom 1.5 are children under 60 months and 2.3 are children age 5 to 15. Focusing on the
children under 60 months old that are used in this paper’s analysis, 49.4 percent of them are
female and their average age is 30.7 months old.5 Only 18.5 percent of these children’s parents
(father or mother) have ever been enrolled in school. On average, children have 1.03 routine
preventative health clinic visits per year, although younger children (0-23 months) have more
visits (1.43) than older (24-59 months) children (0.80).6

5

Note that of the poor eligible surveyed households in the treatment and control villages, only 1618 households are
used in the health analysis for this paper, because the remaining households did not have any children under 60
months old.
6
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the following schedule for preventive childhood health care
visits: birth, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48
months, 60 months.

The health care system in rural Burkina Faso is relatively underdeveloped. In the 75
survey villages, not every village has a health clinic, but the median distance to the nearest health
clinic is only two kilometers (average distance is 2.85 kilometers). This is below the Burkina
Faso national average distance to a basic health care center, which is 7.5 kilometers (Ministry of
Health 2007). In addition, there are no statistically significant differences across treatment and
control groups in the average distance to a health clinic.
Access to basic health care remains poor in Burkina Faso. In 2007, only 36 percent of the
population had access to basic health care (Ministry of Heath 2010). The available data also
suggest that the health system is under-staffed. In 2009, the ratios of total population to health
care professionals indicate there are 22,522 people per physician, 94,564 per pharmacist, and
2,892 people per nurse (Ministry of Health 2010). The poor access to health services translates
into lower utilization of health care, especially preventive health care. In rural Burkina Faso, it is
estimated that only 60 percent of baby deliveries are attended by a trained health care provider,
with large variations across regions (INSD/ORC Macro 2010). Noticeable exceptions include
immunization coverage (more than 80 percent of children in rural areas) and utilization of
prenatal care (around 94 percent of pregnant women in rural area).
In Table 2, we use baseline data to test the balance of the randomization experiment. We
first present the mean of the specific variable measured at the baseline for the control group and
each of the four treatment arms. In the subsequent columns, we present p-values from a Wald
test comparing the treatment arm with control group. Finally, in the last column (under the
control group heading), we present the p-value for an F-test of the joint test that the means of the
five groups are equal. Results show balance across characteristics for children, parents, and
measures of supply-side health clinic quality. The main dependent variable used in this paper,

9

routine preventative health clinic visits, was only collected in the final survey round, so we are
unable to examine whether the variable exhibits balance in the baseline round (pre-intervention)
across the treatment and control groups.7
Household attrition was very low between the baseline and one-year follow-up survey
(1.42 percent), and increases slightly when comparing the baseline and two-year follow-up
survey (4.62 percent). In Table 3, we explore the relative differences between attritor and nonattritor households. Column 1 presents means of the household-level characteristics from the
baseline survey for the sample of households that were followed from the baseline to the twoyear follow-up survey (non-attritors). Column 2 presents means for the sample of attritor
households, and column 3 presents the average difference in characteristics between attritors and
non-attritors, as well as a test of whether the difference is statistically significant. Results suggest
that attrition is not likely random, as attritors are more likely to come from smaller households,
with fewer adults, are younger, have fewer wives, and are more likely to be female headed
households. However, what is more relevant for our analysis is whether attrition differs across
treatment and control groups. In columns 4 to 7 of Table 3, we present difference-in-differences
regressions for each characteristic comparing the difference between attritors and non-attritors in
each specific treatment arm with the same difference between attritors and non-attritors in the
control group, and we find few significant differences.
3. Empirical Identification Strategy
The key question we want to answer is whether cash transfers increased the frequency of routine
preventative visits to health facilities by young children in recipient households. The
experimental design provides a strong identification strategy and allows us to attribute any
7

However, we are able to test baseline balance for other health outcomes for which we do have three rounds of data,
such as the probability the child was sick during the past month, health clinic utilization, and illness duration, and all
of these exhibit balance across randomized treatment and control groups in the baseline.

10

differences in outcome indicators (frequency of preventative visits to health clinics) between the
treatment and control groups to the impact of the program. Because precise questions about the
purpose of the visits to the health clinics were only included in the last round of data collection
(Round 3), we cannot use a difference-in-differences model. We rely on the program
randomization to identify causal impacts of alternative cash transfer delivery mechanisms on
routine health clinic visits. Since Table 2 indicates that health behaviors and supply-side
measures of health clinic quality were well balanced across the five study groups at baseline, this
provides support for our identification strategy. We focus on the program effects on the treated
households.
We start by pooling the treatment arms to estimate two distinct specifications. First, we
consider households that were either randomly selected to receive conditional cash transfers or
randomly selected to receive unconditional cash transfers (see Panel B of Figure 1). This
approach combines into one group the conditional cash transfers given to fathers or mothers and
into a second group the unconditional cash transfers given to fathers or mothers. With this
specification we focus on whether the conditionality matters and we ignore the intra-household
allocation aspects of the design. Formally, the regression is specified as follows:
(1)

y ih   0   1CCTh   2UCTh  1 X ih   ih

where yih is the number of routine preventative health clinic visits for child i in household h,
CCTh and UCTh are treatment indicators that take the value one if a child lives in a household h
that was randomly selected to receive respectively, conditional or unconditional cash transfers
and is zero otherwise, Xih is a vector of child characteristics (gender and age) and ε is an error

11

term.8 The estimated impact for conditional cash transfers is given by α1 and for unconditional
cash transfers by α2.
Second, we consider households that were either randomly assigned to receive the
stipends via the mother or via the father (Panel C of Figure 2). This approach combines into one
group the conditional and unconditional cash transfers given to fathers and into a second group
the conditional and unconditional cash transfers given to mothers. When estimating this
specification, we focus on intra-household allocation (whether paying the stipends to the mother
or the father leads to different outcomes), and we ignore the role that conditionality might play.
We estimate the following regression:
(2)

y ih   0   1CTFh   2 CTM h   1 X ih   ih

where CTFh indicates a household h that is randomly selected to receive cash transfer given to
fathers, CTMh indicates a household h that is randomly selected to receive cash transfer given to
mothers, and all of the other variables are as defined previously. In Equation 2, α1 and α2
represent the impact of cash transfers to fathers and to mothers, respectively.
It is plausible that mothers and fathers react differently not only to the transfers, but also
to the conditionality. In order to test this hypothesis, we allow the four treatment groups to enter
separately in the regression. The resulting specification is:
(3)

y ih   0   1CCTFh   2 CCTM h   3UCTFh   4UCTM h   1 X ih   ih

where the four treatment groups are defined as binary variables and are represented by CCTFh
(conditional cash transfers to fathers), CCTMh (conditional cash transfers to mothers), UCTFh
(unconditional cash transfers to fathers) and UCTMh (unconditional cash transfers to mothers).

8

Correlation among the error terms of children in a given village experiencing the same shocks might bias the
ordinary least squares standard errors downward, so in all regressions we cluster the standard errors at the village
level.

12

All of the other variables are defined as before. The estimated impact of each treatment scheme
is given by the associated coefficient, α1, α2, α3, and α4.
4. Empirical Results
In Table 4, we present results from estimating the three equations discussed above for routine
preventative health clinic visits. Each regression includes controls for the child’s gender and year
of birth cohort. All regressions are restricted to children under 60 months old. Column 1 focuses
on the comparison between conditional and unconditional cash transfers, while Column 2
focuses on the comparison between transfers given to fathers or mothers. Finally, in Column 3,
we examine the impact of all four treatment groups separately.
We find that conditional cash transfers have a larger impact on routine health clinic visits
than unconditional cash transfers. Young children less than 60 months old in households that
receive conditional cash transfers have 0.43 more routine preventative health clinic visits in the
preceding year compared to comparable children in the control villages. This represents an
increase of 42 percent compared to the average number of routine visits. We find no significant
impact of unconditional cash transfers on these routine health visits, and relative to unconditional
cash transfers, the impact on routine health clinic visits is significantly larger for conditional
transfers. We are able to strongly reject equality between the coefficients on the conditional and
unconditional variables with a p-value of 0.002.
Turning to evaluate the impact of cash transfers given to fathers compared to mothers, in
column 2, we estimate a regression with the same dependent variable but with independent
variables indicating if a child was in a household where the cash transfers were given to fathers
or to mothers. Overall, children in households that received cash transfers (either to the father or
mother) receive more routine preventative health clinic visits than children in control

13

households, although neither coefficient is statistically significant. Although the point estimate is
larger for children in households where the mother received the transfer (0.235), we cannot reject
equality between that coefficient and the coefficient for cash transfer to fathers (0.070) with a pvalue of the test of equality of 0.35.
The above results where the cash transfers are grouped by the presence or absence of
conditionality (Column 1) and the transfer recipient’s gender (Column 2) potentially hide the fact
that there could be significant differences between how conditionality interacts with a recipient’s
gender. To explore this further, in Column 3, we estimate Equation 3 in which we include four
indicator variables corresponding to each of the four different treatments (conditional cash
transfers to fathers, conditional cash transfers to mothers, unconditional cash transfers to fathers,
and unconditional cash transfers to mothers). Results highlight that conditionality is critical for
improving take-up of routine preventative health clinic visits. Children living in households
where the cash transfers were conditional and given to mothers have 0.446 more preventative
health clinic visits and the coefficient is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. For
children living in households where the cash transfers were conditional and given to fathers, the
results indicate they have 0.415 more routine health clinic visits, although the coefficient is not
statistically significant at standard levels. In testing the equality of these two coefficients, we are
not able to reject equality, with the p-value equal to 0.901. These results for conditional cash
transfers contrast with those for unconditional cash transfers. Children living in households that
received unconditional cash transfers given to fathers or living in households that received
unconditional cash transfers given to mothers show no significant impact on the take-up of
routine preventative health clinic visits. The point estimate is positive, but small for
unconditional cash transfers to mothers and is actually negative for fathers, indicating children in

14

these two treatment arms are no better off compared to comparable children in the control
households. Formally testing equality between the coefficients shows that the impact of
conditional cash transfers to mothers is larger than both unconditional cash transfers to mothers
or fathers. The impact of conditional cash transfers to fathers is larger than unconditional cash
transfers to fathers and mothers, although we can only reject equality with a p-value of 0.156 for
the test with mothers.
In the next three tables, we examine if there is a heterogeneous impact of cash transfers
based on child gender (Table 5), child age (Table 6), or the baseline poverty status of the
household (Table 7). In Table 5, impacts of alternative cash transfers are fairly consistent across
boys and girls. Conditional cash transfers have a larger impact than unconditional cash transfers
for both boys and girls, and we are able to reject equality in both regressions (p-value equal to
0.019 for boys and 0.002 for girls). We find no statistically significant impacts on routine health
clinic visits when the cash transfers are grouped by mother or father (columns 2 and 5). We find
suggestive evidence that conditional cash transfers to fathers have a larger impact on routine
health clinic visits for girls (an additional 0.580 visits), while conditional cash transfers to
mothers have a larger impact on health clinic visits for boys (an additional 0.505 visits).
Conditional cash transfers to mothers still have a significant impact for girls, and we are not able
to reject equality between the impact of conditional cash transfers to fathers or mothers (for
either boys or girls). Unconditional cash transfers to fathers or mothers show no significant
positive impact for either boys or girls.
Table 6 presents separate results for younger (ages 0 to 23 months) and older (ages 24-59
months) children. All of the impacts of cash transfers on routine preventative health clinic visits
discussed previously are being driven by older children. This might be explained by the fact that

15

parents in Burkina Faso are less likely to bring older children for routine preventative care visits.
Indeed, as noted previously, on average, younger children have more visits (1.43) than older
children (0.80), so that, while routine visits for young children might already be frequent for
young children in the absence of the transfers, the transfers might have had a relatively larger
impact on the less frequent visits for older children.
We find no statistically significant impact of cash transfers on routine health clinic visits
for younger children. To put this in perspective, this means that young children (0-23 months) in
control households are as equally likely to have gone to a health clinic for a routine visit as a
young child in a treatment household. This contrasts with older children for whom there are large
impacts of the cash transfers on the number of routine health clinic visits. Conditional cash
transfers yield larger impacts on increasing the number of routine preventative health clinic visits
compared to unconditional cash transfers, with an increase of 0.592 visits for the older children,
representing an increase of 74 percent over the mean number of visits. For older children, cash
transfers to mothers or to fathers show increases in routine health clinic visits, although only the
coefficient on the mother’s variable is statistically significant. Finally, conditional cash transfers
to fathers or mothers show larger impacts for the older children, increasing the number of health
clinic visits by 0.630 and 0.558 visits, respectively. This represents increases of 79 and 70
percent, respectively for cash transfers to fathers or mothers that are conditional, compared to the
average number of routine health clinic visits children of this age receive.
In Table 7, we do not find any significant differences between the impacts for cash
transfers given to extremely poor or less poor households. As discussed in Section 2.1, recall that
all households that were eligible to receive the cash transfers were below the estimated national
poverty line. The further distinction in Table 7 is comparing extremely poor and less poor

16

households, which might explain the absence of differential impacts by poverty status.9
Conditional cash transfers increase the number of routine preventative health care visits for
children in those households and the household’s poverty status does not alter this relationship
(columns 1 and 4). There are no significant improvements on health clinic visits for the
regressions when we group transfers to mothers or transfers to fathers. As before, conditionality
is driving our observed results and the gender of the recipient does not matter, and the estimated
impacts are similar between extremely poor and less poor households.
5. Conclusions
This paper presents evidence of the health impacts from a cash transfer pilot program in rural
Burkina Faso, the Nahouri Cash Transfer Pilot Program (NCTPP). Our evaluation focuses on
routine preventative health clinic visits for children 0 to 5 years old. The NCTPP incorporated a
random experimental design to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the following modalities for
delivering cash transfers: conditional versus unconditional and transfers to mothers versus
fathers. Families under the conditional cash transfer schemes were required to obtain child
growth monitoring at local health clinics for all young children.
Our results indicate that children in families that received conditional cash transfers had
an additional 0.43 routine preventative health clinic visits during the previous year compared to
children in the control households. These results contrast with those for unconditional cash
transfers given to either fathers or mothers, which showed no beneficial impacts. As long as the
transfers were conditional, we did not find any significant difference between whether the money
was given to fathers or to mothers, indicating that at least for routine health clinic visits, the cash
transfer recipient’s gender is not a critical factor influencing outcomes. One limitation of our

9

To make this additional distinction in Table 7, extremely poor households are defined as being below the median
household per capita expenditure level in the baseline survey.

17

analysis is that the health clinic visits are self-reported by the parents. In future work, we will
investigate more objectively measured child health outcomes such as anthropometrics and infant
mortality.
From a policy perspective, conditional cash transfers appear to have stronger beneficial
impacts on increasing the number of routine health care visits for children. This finding should
be balanced with the additional administrative and logistical costs implied by imposing and
verifying the conditionality. For the outcome analyzed in this paper – routine preventative health
clinic visits - the gender of the recipient does not seem to affect critically the impact of the cash
transfers on those health outcomes. Such a conclusion, however, needs to be included in a larger
analysis of other health and schooling outcomes as well as other age ranges for the children.
Indeed, the NSPP is a broad social protection pilot program that covers all children until
age 15 in the eligible households and aims to improve both their schooling and health outcomes.
It should be emphasized that while we focus on children under age 5 in this analysis, those
children could have benefited from the (larger) transfers received for their older siblings. It is not
clear that by only implementing the part of the intervention targeted for young children (0 to 59
months), similar health results would necessarily be obtained.

Notes: Robust standard errors in brackets, clustered at the village level. *significant at 10%; **
significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%. All regressions are restricted to children under 60
months old and include child age fixed effects and child gender dummies. All households that
were eligible to receive the cash transfers were below the estimated national poverty line. The
further distinction in this table is comparing extremely poor and less poor households. Extremely
poor households are defined as being below the median household per capita expenditure level in
the baseline survey. The treatment arms are abbreviated as CCT (conditional cash transfer), UCT
(unconditional cash transfer), CTF (cash transfer given to fathers), CTM (cash transfer given to
mothers), CCT-Father (conditional cash transfer given to fathers), CCT-Mother (conditional cash
transfer given to mothers), UCT-Father (unconditional cash transfer given to fathers), and UCTMother (unconditional cash transfer given to mothers). Data source: Nahouri Cash Transfer Pilot
