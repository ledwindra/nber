    "abstract": "\n\nGains in 20th century real wages and reductions in the black-white wage gap have been linked to the mid-century ascent of school quality. With a new dataset uniquely appropriate to identifying the impact of female voter enfranchisement on education spending, we attribute up to one-third of the 1920-1940 rise in public school expenditures to the Nineteenth Amendment. Yet the continued disenfranchisement of black southerners meant white school gains far outpaced those for blacks. As a result, women\u2019s suffrage exacerbated racial inequality in education expenditures and substantially delayed relative gains in black human capital observed later in the century.\n\n",
