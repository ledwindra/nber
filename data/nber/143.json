(1) For this purpose we fit an earnings function to each of the individual histories in the sample.(2) We then try to ascertain the extent to which the estimated variation in individual parameters helps in explaining the cross-sectional variation in earnings.(3) we further inquire into the relation between the individual parameters and a vector of personal characteristics, as well as(4) into indirect (via variables and parameters) and direct effects of these characteristics on earnings.\n\n",
