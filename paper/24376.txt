Worker Flows, Entry and Productivity in the New Zealand Construction Industry

NBER Working Paper No. 24376
March 2018
JEL No. D24,J63,L74
ABSTRACT
The 21st century global decline in productivity growth is not well understood. One possible
contributor is a decline in economic dynamism. We explore the contribution of firm formation
and employee movement to productivity using administrative data on the population of New
Zealand construction firms from 2001-2012, along with linked data on their employees and
working proprietors, to study the relationships among entry, worker flows and firm productivity.
Entrants are more productive than pre-existing firms. Firms that enter and stay exhibit a persistent
productivity advantage that averages about seven percent, but which grows as experience
accumulates. We find that job churn is prevalent in construction, with around 60 percent of firmworker pairs not existing previously or not existing subsequently. Firms with new employees are
more productive than those with no change in workforce, in part because of knowledge flows
from other construction firms. In our preferred specification, with firm fixed effects, a standard
deviation increase in the productivity of new employees' previous firms is associated with a 0.6
percent increase in productivity. The entry and worker-knowledge-flow phenomena are distinct,
in that the entry effect is not explained by employee composition, and non-entrant firms also
benefit from worker knowledge flows.

Introduction

From Josef Schumpeter in 1942 (Schumpeter, reissued 2013) to the most recent OECD report on
the NZ economy (OECD 2017), economists have emphasized the dynamic reallocation of workers
and other resources, including the birth and death of firms, as key determinants of aggregate
productivity growth. The importance of dynamism to productivity has gained added urgency with
the global slowdown in productivity growth over the last 15 years, with some suggesting a decline
in new firm formation as a contributor to declining productivity performance (e.g. Haltiwanger,
et al, 2015). Because productivity is, by definition, a residual, it is hard to say what attributes of
new firms or new workers are the source of higher productivity. In this paper, we use unusually
detailed micro data on firms and workers to see if productivity performance can be traced to the
history of workers and firms. We focus on the construction sector because of its importance, its
historically poor productivity performance, and the prevalence of small firms in which we expect
to have the best chance of finding productivity effects of individual employees. We find that much
of the superior performance of entrants cannot be explained even with our rich data--new firms
have higher productivity and more rapid productivity growth, and this difference remains after
controlling for observables. But we do find that employees' previous history does affect firms'
productivity, for both new entrants and continuing firms. In particular, employees previously
employed at high-productivity construction firms 'bring with them' a portion of the productivity
advantage of previous employers.
The finding that new firms are more productive than exiting firms is common in the
international literature (Aw et al. 2002; Foster et al. 2008) and is generally seen as a manifestation
of Schumpeter's 'creative destruction'; underperforming firms are unprofitable and so leave in a
process of natural selection (Jovanovic, 1982). One characteristic of new firms is that their
employees have to have come from somewhere else. We expect that a firm's productivity is, in
part, a result of its employees' human capital, so it is natural to wonder if the productivity of
entrants is related to their employees. Further, if the higher productivity of entrants is indeed
related to the employees that they attract, it is then natural to ask if ongoing firms could get the
same productivity advantage if they could attract the same kind of employees. In this paper we
explore empirically the interaction of the entry and exit of firms with the movement of employees
across firms, both to entrants and between existing firms. We investigate this using linked
employer-employee data on all construction-industry jobs in New Zealand from 2001 to 2012. We
hypothesize that the flows of workers across construction firms is a source of knowledge transfer,
and that these knowledge flows are part of the reason new construction firms perform well. The
construction industry is particularly suitable for this analysis, because the small size of most firms
likely increases the importance of individual workers with respect to firm performance.

Our study is related to two main strands of literature. The first strand documents the
extent of firm churn and its correlation with aggregate productivity growth. The international
evidence suggests that churn’s contribution tends to be small but positive. This holds for
manufacturing in the United States (Bartelsman and Dhrymes, 1998), manufacturing and mining
in Israel (Griliches and Regev, 1995), manufacturing in Chile (Liu, 1993), and manufacturing in
Taiwan (Aw et al., 2001). Broad overviews are given by Bartelsman et al. (2004) and Kocsis et al.
(2009), who document the importance of firm churn in reallocating resources in developed and
developing countries, and its positive correlation with productivity growth. In New Zealand, Doan
et al. (2012) document the prevalence of firm churn and find that it is procyclical, while Law and
McLellan (2005) find that net firm entry is negatively associated with industry labor productivity.
In contrast, Maré et al. (2016) look at a different time period and consider multi-factor
productivity (MFP) growth. They find that although entrants and exiters tend to be less productive
than continuers, the net contribution of firm churn tends to be positive.
This literature highlights two main channels through which churn affects industry
productivity. The first is the direct channel of reallocating resources towards the most productive
firms. Firms that are going to exit tend to suffer the ‘shadow of death’ of lower productivity
(Griliches and Regev, 1995), and so their exit releases the firms’ capital and labor to be used by
more productive entrants and incumbents. If exiting firms tend to be less productive than
entrants, then firm churn will directly increase productivity. If entrant firms are also more
productive than continuers then firm churn will boost productivity by an even larger amount. The
second channel through which churn may improve productivity is indirect. The threat of entry
creates competitive pressure for incumbent firms. Increased competition may then spur
innovation and, ultimately, productivity growth. Together, this churn underlies the creative
destruction that Schumpeter believed was the ‘essential fact about capitalism’ (Schumpeter,
reissued 2013).
A second strand of related literature looks at the flows of employees across firms, and the
extent to which this correlates with firm performance. Thanks to the increased availability of
linked employer-employee data, research into worker flows has been expanding. Yet, few studies
have linked these flows to firm performance. Bjelland et al. (2011) document these flows in the
US, showing that they make up around 4 percent of quarterly employment and 29 percent of main
job separations; that they are procyclical; that employees with less education tend to switch
employers more; and that over half of employee switches are between industries (using the
broadest grouping of industries). Other studies also show that job flows are large, with a lot of
dynamism in various economies (Hopenhayn and Rogerson 1993, Davis et al. 2006). Maliranta et
al. (2009) use Finnish data to examine whether workers spread R&D-generated knowledge when
moving between firms. They conclude that knowledge from new employees can be readily
implemented by firms, because hiring an employee previously in an R&D role boosts firm
2

performance only when moving the employee into a non-R&D role. Campbell et al. (2012)
examine employer-employee flows in US legal services, and find that wealthier employees are less
likely to leave a firm but are more likely to create a spin-out firm conditional on leaving. They also
find firm performance is hurt more when an employee leaves to form a spin-out firm than to
become an employee at another firm.
Our study makes a contribution to both strands of literature by exploring the relationship
between worker flows and firm productivity. We also examine the extent to which the positive
contribution of firm churn can be explained by worker flows, by looking at entrant effects after
controlling for the past productivity of new workers. Our study brings these two important
strands of literature together. It contributes to the ‘firm churn’ literature by providing new
evidence that cannot be gained by examining firm-level data alone, and to the ‘worker flows’
literature by offering new insights into the pathway through which workers contribute to firm
productivity, which is not possible by looking at individual-level data alone.

To preview our findings, we show that
•

Entrant firms are observationally different from firms that were active in
construction at the start of this period. They are more productive on average, they
grow faster, and their productivity continues to improve over time. Accounting for
observable differences in the composition of their work force reduces the 'entrant
effect' somewhat but does not eliminate it.

•

The productivity advantage of entrants is smaller in their first year, and the
productivity performance of entrants then improves for at least a few years after
entry.

•

Workers frequently move in and out of jobs in construction, with an overall job
churn rate of around 60 percent in most years. Firms (new or existing) that have
new workers in a given year show higher productivity in that year. More generally,
firm growth is associated with firm productivity improvement, though we cannot
say anything about causality in this relationship.

•

Firms whose work force previously worked at another high-productivity
construction firm are themselves more productive, and self-report higher rates of
innovation from their workers. This worker-embodied-productivity effect is small
but not trivial and is statistically significant.

Data1

This study uses rich administrative data from Statistics New Zealand's Integrated Data
Infrastructure (IDI) and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), which are collections of datasets
containing longitudinal information on individuals, households and firms.2 We use the work of
Fabling and Maré (2015a), who process these data to estimate labor input in full-time equivalent
(FTE) units, and to identify individuals who are working proprietors at a firm. This identification
allows us to separately consider the movements of employees and working proprietors at
construction firms. This is important because a large proportion of construction firms in New
Zealand have no workers other than the proprietor(s), and working proprietors may contribute
to firm productivity differently than other employees.
The IDI provides measures or allows construction of measures of worker characteristics
including age, engagement in on-the-job training, engagement in post-secondary education,
migration history and visa status. We supplement these observed characteristics with estimates
of employees' unobserved worker quality from Maré and Hyslop (2006) and Maré, Hyslop and
Fabling (2017). Maré and Hyslop estimate log wage regressions with observed characteristics,
firm fixed effects, and employee fixed effects. They and we interpret the employee fixed effects
from these regressions as a measure of unobserved aspects of an employee's quality as a worker.
Each firm in the LBD is assigned a predominant industry, using Australia and New Zealand
Industry Classification (ANZSIC) 2006 codes. These allow us to identify construction firms, as well
as worker flows between and within industries. We identify entrants and exiters by observing
employment data over time in the IDI. A firm is an entrant if it had no labor input (either
employees or working proprietors) in the previous year and is an exiter if it has no labor input in
the following year.
To explore the productivity of firms, we calculate firms’ real gross output, capital services,
intermediate materials, and labor input. Real output, capital, and intermediate materials are
measured by deflating dollar amounts captured in the LBD. The production dataset is not
comprehensive, because of missing data and restrictions to ensure consistency and accuracy;
firms with useable production data account for 62 percent of total gross output across all
industries that are covered by production data. Nonetheless, the productivity coverage is
substantial, and allows us to examine the productivity of firms that workers move between. We
warn that the labor and capital measures are less reliable for working-proprietor firms than for
employing firms (see Fabling and Maré 2015b for details).

In addition to measuring current firm productivity, we use these data to measure
knowledge flows from firm to firm. We do this by looking at the productivity of new workers’
previous firms, as detailed in Section 4.2.
In part of our analysis we supplement the above administrative data with the 2005, 2007,
2009, and 2011 Business Operations Surveys (BOS). These surveys, run by Statistics New Zealand
and targeted at firms with six or more employees, include questions on firms’ sources of new
ideas, which we use to corroborate our measures of knowledge flows.

Firm entry and productivity

Our framework for looking at productivity is the augmented production function, which models
firms' output as a function of its inputs and various productivity 'shifters'. These regressions take
the following form:

=

+

+

+

+

+

+

(1)

where j denotes firm and t denotes year. The lower-case y, k, l, and m represent the log of gross
output, capital, labor and intermediate inputs. Zjt denotes a vector of other firm-year specific
control variables including indicators for having production data from the Annual Enterprise
Survey (AES, typically larger firms), and an indicator for being in Canterbury after the 2011
earthquake.3

represents one or more variables that are the focus of the study, hypothesized to

shift the productivity of the firm. The terms

and

correspond to year and firm effects. We

include year-specific intercepts in all regressions. We explore different approaches to unobserved
firm effects, including a variety of industry dummies as well as firm fixed effects. The error term
is

and captures variations in gross output not explained by the model. Hence our coefficient

estimates of interest are in the vector , and capture the associations of workers’ past productivity
with a firm’s current productivity.4
We begin by exploring the productivity performance of entrants relative to that of
continuing firms, based on the complete sample. This is an empirically complex question, because
firms' entry and related decisions are likely correlated with unobserved attributes. We therefore
do not attempt to build a causal model of behaviour, but rather simply to characterize the
regularities in the data.

In September 2010 and February 2011 the Canterbury region, where about 13% of the New Zealand population
resided, experienced severe earthquakes which resulted in widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure.
Extensive rebuilding has since started.
4 To conserve space, the coefficients for the non-augmenting terms are not reported in the results tables. Appendix
Table 6 provides complete regression results for columns 2 and 3 of Table 1; the unreported coefficients for other
regressions are all similar.

The first column of Table 1 asks simply whether the productivity of the firms observed
entering during our data period differs, on average, from the productivity of those firms that are
present in the dataset in the first year. The answer is 'yes'--for given level of inputs and controlling
for industry these firms produce on average about six percent more output. We will see that a
large overall difference for these firms is a robust feature of these data.
The subsequent columns in Table 1 show how the performance of entrants evolves over
time after entry. Column 2 includes in the regression all firms in the dataset, and allows for a
productivity difference in each of the first four years of life, and the last year. The omitted group,
and hence the group against which each of the dummy coefficients is calculated, is all years that
are not years 1-4 and are not a final year. The results suggest that the first few years of a firm's
existence are comparatively high-productivity years. But it is important to think carefully about
what these coefficients actually measure. Firms that are not observed as entrants never have an
early year observed in our data. So the comparison underlying the coefficients in the first column
is between the early years of entrant firms, and a mixture of (a) years 5 and up for entrants, and
(b) all years for non-entrants. Further, some firms enter and then exit. The firms for which year 2,
year 3 or year 4 is observed are each somewhat different. To the extent that the entrants are
intrinsically different from the non-entrants, and/or firms that enter and then exit differ from
persistent entrants, column 2 is hard to interpret.
To unpick this puzzle, columns 3-6 of Table 1 are estimated including only those firms that
are observed as entrants and then persist for at least 4 years.5 This means that the coefficients are
not influenced by the overall difference in productivity between the entrant group and the nonentrant group, and do not contain the effects of firms that enter and then exit relatively quickly.
Column 3 is just like column 2, but estimated on this smaller sample. We find that the positive and
significant coefficient in the first year goes away, suggesting that that result in the column 2 is
dominated by entrants overall being more productive than non-entrants, rather than by what goes
on in entrants' first year.6 But the interpretation of the results in column 3 is still made somewhat
murky by the fact that we observe some entrants for 4 years, some for 5, some for 6, etc. The
coefficient on year 1 is the average difference between year 1 and all years greater than 4. If firms
that appear in the data for different durations differ from each other, those across-firm differences
will be affecting the results in column 2 in an unknown way.
Column 4 explores this dynamic further by estimating the model with firm fixed effects. This
means that the coefficients for each dummy represent the average difference for the observations

Appendix Table 1 presents simple statistics for the variables appearing in Table 1, for this main sample of firms ever
seen entering which also appear at least four times.
6 Other results (not reported) suggest that there may also be a tendency for firms that enter and then exit quickly to
show relatively high productivity while they last. This is likely a mixture of data problems and specialized firms that
are created for a single project and then dissolved. Because it is not our main interest, and these firms by their nature
cannot have a lasting impact on industry productivity, we focus on those firms that remain active at least 4 years.

in that group between that observation and the mean for the corresponding firm. The coefficient
on the first year is now negative and statistically significant. This means that for firms that enter
at some point in the observed period, the first year we observe them exhibits about seven percent
lower productivity than the average in the data for that firm. This below-average performance
falls to about one percent in years 2-4.
In Section 4.2 we explore the relationship between firm productivity and the previous work
experience of employees. Without going into the details of that formulation, the last two columns
simply test whether inclusion of those effects changes the results regarding entrant productivity
dynamics. For the most part, they do not. That is, column 5 is similar to column 3 and column 6 is
very similar to column 4. Thus the dynamics of entry are largely distinct empirically from the
effects of workforce composition. Finally, we note that the final year a firm is observed shows
productivity consistently about 13 percent below non-exit years, and this estimate is highly robust
to the different specifications.
The fixed effect for each firm (its overall mean) is estimated, of course, on the data observed.
For some firms this is 5 years; for some it is more. For a firm that is in the data for 5 years, we do
not know what its firm mean would be if it were around for 10. Ultimately, since we have
unbalanced data and we do not know why firms come and go, there are limits to how much we
can say about the underlying dynamics. But we can note two strong tendencies, even if we cannot
explain them: firms that are observed to enter sometime in the period have persistently higher
productivity than non-entrants. And the productivity observed in a firm's first year, for entrants
that continue to produce for at least 4 years, is lower than the average productivity eventually
observed for the firm. This suggests that the entrants are intrinsically different firms than the nonentrants, and that their superior performance is not an artefact of the start-up situation. Indeed,
the data are consistent with a shake-down or learning period over which entrants gradually
achieve their potential.

Firm productivity and experience of new workers

4.1

Importance of new labor in construction
Before turning to the relationship between productivity and workforce composition, we

pause to simply describe the extent of new labor at construction firms. Figure 1 shows the job
entry, exit, and churn rates over 2001-2013 for workers in construction, whether they are
employees or working proprietors. For this purpose, a 'job' is a match between a specific worker
and a specific firm: a new (dying) job is defined as the first (last) year in which such a match is
observed in our data. The job entry rate is the proportion of all jobs that are new jobs, the job exit
rate is the proportion of jobs that are dying jobs, and the job churn rate is the sum of the job entry
7

rate and the job exit rate. The job churn rate is large; in most years about 60 percent of jobs either
never existed in the past, or will not exist again in the future. This drops to just under 50 percent
in the wake of the global financial crisis, consistent with the general finding that job churn is
procyclical (Lazear and Spletzer 2012, Bjelland et al. 2011).7
Figure 1 counts all jobs equally regardless of the fraction of full-time, and new jobs are for
less time than others on average. Figure 2 shows that the proportion of labor in construction that
is new on an FTE basis varies from 19 percent (in 2005) to around 10 percent (2010). The figure
also shows where new labor comes from: other construction firms, firms in other industries, or
not in the job data in the previous year (the left out category, not graphed).8 In most years, around
five percent of all labor comes from new jobs where the worker was in construction the previous
year. A similar rate holds for labor from other industries.
Figure 3 shows the 4-year history and future of all people working in construction between
2005 and 2010. This further highlights the dynamism of the labor market in construction; among
those employed, fewer than 40 percent of people held the same job four years prior and only
around 40 percent held the same job four years after. Interestingly, the second most common
category is the miscellaneous omitted group. This means that many current workers in
construction have pasts and futures that involve some combination of education, overseas travel,
several part-time jobs with less than 0.25 FTE worked at each one, and other activities.
Panel B replicates the above for new workers at entrant firms. A new worker cannot have
worked at the same entrant firm in previous years, and so the remaining three categories have
higher proportions mechanically. However, note that entrant workers are especially likely to
come from other construction firms; in the pre-period the proportion coming from construction
diverges from the proportion coming from another industry, while the pattern is the opposite in
Panel A. This pattern suggests one reason entrant firms may be more productive – they source
their labor from other construction firms. We explore this hypothesis statistically in the next
subsection.

4.2

Firm productivity and experience of new workers
We turn next to a set of augmented production function regressions that explore the

association between firm productivity and the introduction of new employees with varying
experience in terms of the productivity of their previous employers. The variables capturing new
workers’ average MFP at previous firms is split into employees and working proprietors, and is a

The pattern is similar when defining a new job as a relationship that did not exist the previous year, and an exiting
job as one that does not exist the following year.
8 A person’s labor ‘from construction’ is calculated by weighting her current labor input by her labor input at
construction firms the previous year. For example, if someone works 0.5 FTE this year, and worked 0.5 FTE in
construction the previous year, then she contributes 0.25 FTE from construction. Labor from other industries is
calculated analogously.
7

8

double-FTE weighted measure9: first, we weight previous MFP by the FTE worked at that firm,
because a worker will transfer less knowledge when only working at a previous firm for a short
time. Secondly, we weight these past-productivity measures by the current FTE worked with the
firm, because a worker will transfer less knowledge and have less impact when only working at a
new job for less time. The past productivity of new workers is measured over the previous two
years to reduce noise while still reflecting relatively recent experience. We scale the employeepast-productivity-experience variables by firm size, expecting that the impact of any one worker
is less the larger the firm.10
In addition to these productivity-transfer variables, we include in the regression a set of
dummy variables that simply capture whether the firm in that year had any new workers from
various sources. We include these because firms that are adding new employees in any given year
are likely to be experiencing other environmental factors that may be correlated with
productivity. We interpret the coefficients on these dummy variables as capturing such incidental
dynamic factors, so that the coefficients on the previous MFP experience of the workers can be
interpreted as associated with those workers rather than background conditions.
The first column of Table 2 reproduces, for comparative purposes, the basic entrant-effect
regression of Table 1.11 The second column shows the coefficients on the workforce composition
variables excluding the entrant effect, and the third column includes both effects. Comparing the
three columns demonstrates some basic results. First, the entrant effect and the knowledge
transfer effect are both present, and they do not interact strongly. That is, the magnitude of each
effect is not greatly changed by inclusion of the other effect. Second, there is a clear effect of
bringing in workers from productive firms, and the knowledge-transfer interpretation of this
effect is strengthened by the fact that the productivity benefit is greater when the previous highMFP employer was a construction firm. Indeed, for employees the effect of productivity of
previous employers outside of the construction industry is not statistically significant.
Because the knowledge-flow variables are weighted by the employees' FTE in both the
productivity-sending firm and the productivity-receiving firm, they can be interpreted as a kind
of fractional effectiveness of transfer. That is, the coefficient of 0.32 in the third column, for
example, means that if we consider two construction firms with differing productivity levels, and
then imagine hypothetically producing two new firms each of which is constructed by simply
The ‘FTE’ measure for working proprietors is not an accurate labor-input measure. Anyone receiving self-employed
income is given a labor-input measure of 1, and this is scaled by the number of working-proprietor jobs in the case of
several self-employment relationships. We also emphasize again that the employee FTE measures tend to
overestimate actual labor input, as discussed in the data appendix. See Fabling and Maré (2015a) for details.
10 Note that past MFP is measured by the Cobb-Douglas production function residuals of Fabling and Maré (2015b)
and are estimated separately for industries roughly corresponding to Statistics New Zealand’s ANZSIC 2006 level 2
industries. For construction, there are three level-2 industries: building construction, heavy and civil engineering
construction, and construction services.
11 Appendix Table 2 presents simple statistics for the variables appearing in Table 2, for this main sample of firms
which appear at least four times.

transferring all of the employees from one of the original two firms, the difference in productivity
between the two new firms would be 38 percent (=exp(0.32)-1) of the difference between the
original firms. Of course, in reality, firms will be a mixture of old and new employees. If only half
of the employees at the new firms come from other firms, then the effect would be half as large.
The estimate for working proprietor past productivity in construction is also statistically
significant. For previous experience in the construction industry, the magnitude is markedly
smaller for working proprietors than for employees; for experience outside of construction it is
larger for working proprietors and is statistically significant. This may reflect the likelihood that
employees coming from outside construction may lack relevant skills, while a proprietor of a new
construction firm likely has significant construction skills even if their previous employment was
not in construction.
Finally, the regression also includes dummy variables for a firm’s having any new workers
from a given source.12 The positive estimates suggest that firms with new employees are more
productive than firms with a static work force. Note that this effect is diminished (but still present)
when the entrant dummy is included in the regression. This makes sense, since entrants by
definition have new employees. We interpret this effect as likely reflecting that when unobserved
good things happen to a firm, it is likely to grow and it is likely to experience a positive productivity
shock. Hence we cannot say anything about causality in this relationship. We believe that the
importance of these variables lies mainly in capturing the effect of unobserved good news on both
productivity and employment growth, so that the effect associated with employment of people
from high-productivity firms are less likely to be spurious. This issue is discussed further in
Section 5.
The results in the third column demonstrate an association between the employment of
workers taken from high-productivity firms and high productivity of the newly-employing firm.
We would like to interpret this effect in terms of the employees bringing with them knowledge
about high-productivity practices. But another interpretation is that the firms that are able to
attract new employees away from high-productivity firms are simply better firms, and so their
higher productivity reflects that difference in the innate quality of the firm, not any effect brought
by the new workers. Appendix Table 3 examines the extent to which above-average workers tend
to work at above-average firms. Using the worker and firm fixed effects estimates of Maré, Hyslop
and Fabling (2017), it groups firms by whether they are ‘good’ firms (high-paying regardless of
who their employees are) and shows the proportion of their workers who are ‘good’ (highly paid
wherever they work). The table shows that 'good' firms are somewhat more likely to have 'good'
workers, both in terms of employees overall and in terms of new hires, though the differences are
not large--just a few percentage points in each case. That is, the firm characteristics represented

by the unobserved δj in Equation (1) may be correlated with the variables capturing worker
knowledge flows; in that case our inability to include δj in the regression biases our estimate of
the knowledge flow effects.
We explore the impact of this 'sorting' phenomenon on our results first by using different
econometric approaches to handling the effect of δj. Column 4 is estimated using firm fixed effects.
This is an appropriate estimation strategy if δj is constant across t for given j.13 As expected, the
result of this estimation approach is to diminish the estimated magnitude of the knowledge
transfer effect, but it is still present for both employees and working proprietors coming from
previously high-MFP firms. The estimate now suggests that about nine percent of the difference
in productivity between source firms is reflected in the productivity of employee-acquiring firms.
Another way to interpret the magnitude is that a standard deviation increase in the productivity
of new employees’ previous firms is associated with a 0.6 percent increase in productivity (.064
* .088 =.006).
Puzzlingly, there is now a negative and statistically significant effect of hiring workers from
high-productivity firms outside of construction. While it is easy to see why knowledge from nonconstruction firms might not be useful, it is hard to see why it would actually be destructive of
productivity. We suspect that this effect may reflect the productivity consequences of hiring
workers with particular industrial backgrounds.
The last column takes as its dependent variable the change in the log of output rather than
the log itself. This approach causes δj to drop out of the equation, eliminating the bias but also
discarding a lot of information so that it becomes harder to get precise estimates. This loss of
precision is seen in the fact that most of the estimates in the last column are not statistically
significant. Most are, however, qualitatively similar to the fixed-effect results. One interesting
result from the first-difference regression is that the coefficient on 'ever an entrant' is positive and
statistically significant. Since the dependent variable in this regression is the change in log output,
the coefficient of .015 tells us that these firms see productivity growth each year that is 1.5
percentage points higher than the other firms. This reinforces the suggestion that these firms are
fundamentally different than the pre-existing firms.
A different way to control for whatever amount of employer-employee sorting may be
occurring is to add augmenting variables to the production function that capture employee
characteristics. Column 1 of Appendix Table 4 repeats our main specification but controls for the
average unobserved and observed skills of a firm’s new workers. Unobserved skills are measured
with estimated worker fixed effects, while observed skills come from gender-year specific age

profiles.14 The average worker skill variable is positive and statistically significant for new
employees, and positive though mostly insignificant for new working proprietors, showing that
firms which hire more skilled workers tend to be more productive. This addition does not,
however, materially change the estimates on the four knowledge-flow variables. Column 2
includes firm fixed effects in our augmented production function. The results are similar to
column 4 of Table 2, supporting the knowledge-flow interpretation of the MFP-transfer results.
For robustness, columns 3 and 4 of Appendix Table 4 replicate columns 3 and 4 of Table 2
but weight each firm by its gross output. This approach gives more importance to larger firms,
allowing the interpretation of the result for the average unit of output in construction rather than
for the average firm. The results are somewhat smaller for the ‘past productivity from
construction’ variables, again suggesting that knowledge flows are less important for larger firms.
This holds even after scaling key covariates by firm size.15
While the results so far allow entrants to have a different productivity level than other firms,
they constrain the MFP-transfer effects to be the same in the two groups. The last column of
Appendix Table 4 explores whether knowledge flows matter more for new firms, by limiting the
sample to entrants in construction. The regression excludes firm fixed effects because few firms
enter more than once.16 The estimates for three of the past-productivity variables are slightly
larger than the corresponding estimates for all firms in column 3 of Table 2, while the estimate
for ‘new employees coming from non-construction firms’ is twice as large. Overall, the results
suggest the phenomenon of knowledge flows is similar in entrant firms.
Table 3 replicates the main results (columns 3 and 4 of Table 2) separately for the main subindustries of construction. Note first that in every sub-industry, there is a reasonably large and
statistically significant positive effect for the entrant firms; for ‘heavy and civil construction’ this
effect is roughly twice as large as for the industry overall. The MFP-transfer results are similar for
‘building construction’ and ‘construction services’, but are noisy and imprecisely estimated for
‘heavy and civil construction’ due to the small number of firms. The ‘past-productivity from
construction’ estimates for ‘construction services’ are statistically significant and larger in
magnitude than the pooled-industry estimates, suggesting knowledge flows are especially
important in this sub-industry. Construction services firms tend to be especially small, which
amplifies the importance of worker flows to the firm’s performance. The patterns are similar for

See the data section for more details. We use one skills variable by adding together each person’s work fixed effect
and each person’s predicted benefit to wages because of the gender-year specific age profile. We then standardize this
measure before including it in our regression.
15 We also ran regressions separately for small firms (under the 75th percentile of firm size, which is about 2.2 FTE)
and large firms (at and above the 75th percentile of firm size). Our main estimates are positive and statistically
significant for small firms, and smaller and insignificant, though still positive, for large firms.
16 Although this is possible, because we define entrants as firms with no labor input in the previous year.

‘building construction’, though smaller in magnitude and statistically insignificant in the
specification with firm fixed effects.17
Finally, Appendix Table 5 replicates columns 3 and 4 of Table 2, for all of construction and
the three sub-industries, but uses a different measure of knowledge flows. These new measures
consider separately labor from productive and unproductive firms, for construction and other
industries. The main patterns are similar, where new employees from productive construction
firms matter more than those from productive non-construction firms (though this does not hold
for new working proprietors). 18

4.3

Employee movement and new ideas
We believe that the regression models in the previous section are strongly supportive of the

hypothesis that employees from high-MFP firms can to some degree transfer the knowledge
underlying that high MFP to other firms when they change jobs. But of course it is hard to know
for sure because we do not observe the knowledge transfer itself. To shed some additional light
on the issue, Table 4 explores whether our measure of employees’ past productivity is associated
with firms’ reporting new ideas. The dependent variables come from the innovation modules of
the 2005-2011 BOS, and so the regressions are limited to the much smaller sample of construction
firms answering these questions. The first column shows that firms with higher employee past
productivity are more likely to report new ideas for innovation from new staff: consider a firm
that gains new employees making up half its labor force, where the employees are coming from
construction firms ten percent more productive than the industry average. The coefficient of
2.261 means that such a firm is 11 percentage points more likely to report new ideas from new
staff, on average and holding all else constant (2.261 * 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.113).
A similarly strong relationship is found when looking at new ideas from firms in the same
industry, while estimates are smaller and statistically insignificant when looking at reporting of
ideas from old staff and ideas from firms in other industries. This is reassuring, and gives further
evidence that our measures of past productivity are capturing knowledge flows from other firms.
When looking at the past productivity of non-construction workers, the coefficient estimates are
smaller and statistically insignificant. This suggests that within-industry knowledge flows are

We also ran regressions estimating the 1-year change in log gross output based on the change in the log of inputs
and the level of the past-productivity variables and their associated dummy variables. Estimates, not reported, are
similar to our firm-fixed-effects specifications, though slightly smaller in magnitude. The ever-entrant dummy is
positive, suggesting much older firms also grow more slowly (1.4 percent less per year for all of construction).
18 We also added variables capturing the average age of new employees and working proprietors, and the proportion
of a firm’s labor force with industry training. The unreported results are similar, showing that our estimates are not
driven by the age of new workers or their industry training.
17

especially important, and that part of the mechanism is through innovative ideas and not merely
productivity embodied in a worker that will be lost when the worker moves on.19
One caveat is that the BOS survey only targets firms with six or more employees. More than
90 percent of construction firms do not meet this threshold. The last section suggested that the
transfer of productivity is stronger in small firms; it is not implausible that the innovation effects
would be similarly as strong or stronger in smaller firms.

Summary and discussion
This paper has analysed how the flows of firms into markets, and workers into firms,

interacts with the productivity of firms. Although international literature suggests firm churn is a
sign of a healthy economy, the potential for knowledge flows through workers is especially high
in New Zealand’s construction industry due to the large number of very small firms.
We find that firms observed to enter during this period are systematically and persistently
more productive than previously existing firms. Looking at the time path of productivity of
entrants, we find them to be modestly less productive in their first year than they later become.
We believe that these patterns suggest that entrant firms have intrinsic advantages over
previously existing firms, but it does take them a year or more to build their productivity to its
true potential.
We have shown that workers regularly change jobs in construction: in most years between
2001 and 2013 around 60 percent of worker-firm pairs either did not previously exist or will not
exist the following year. In terms of overall averages, this movement of workers is associated with
higher productivity. Firms that gain or lose any labor are more productive than static firms, and
firms that gain labor from other construction firms are especially productive.
By looking at the past productivity of new workers’ previous firms, we also find evidence
that workers transfer productivity when changing firms; the average firm is more productive
when more of its labor is made up of new workers who were previously employed at more
productive firms. Comparing the results with and without firm fixed effects suggests that much of
the impact is a matching effect--high quality firms attract and employ workers from other highquality firms. There is, however, a portion of the impact that remains after controlling for this
effect, and workers from construction seem to transfer productivity to a much greater extent than
workers from other industries. These results do suggest that there is a small but statistically
significant effect that can be associated with knowledge flowing from firm to firm through worker
flows.
Though note that these patterns do not hold when measuring past productivity as in Appendix Table 5. One
interpretation is that our main measure is better, because it correlates with these BOS variables in the expected ways.
But it is also important to maintain some skepticism and remember that our measures are not perfect.

19

The knowledge-flow interpretation is corroborated by a finding that firms with new
employees sourced from high-MFP construction firms are more likely to report getting ideas for
innovation from new staff and from other firms in construction, while they are not more likely to
report getting innovative ideas from old staff or from outside construction. Further, having new
employees from high-MFP firms outside construction is not associated with reporting getting new
ideas.
The meaning of this association is clouded by the fact that firms' and employees' decisions
may be correlated with unobserved aspects of the environment that are correlated with
productivity. We have attempted to control for this by including dummy variables for the arrival
of new workers from various sources, and by exploring the relationship with fixed effects, in terms
of productivity growth, and also in terms of reported innovation sourced from employees. We
believe that the persistence of the effect running through these different approaches suggests
there is likely something real.
Together, our results confirm that inflows of new firms and movements of employees are
important to firm productivity. New firms are more productive than existing firms--briefly and
perhaps meaninglessly for those that quickly disappear, but persistently and increasingly for
those that do persist. This is in part because entrants enjoy the benefits of knowledge flows from
other firms carried by their new employees, but the new employee/knowledge-flow effect and the
entrant effect are mostly distinct effects--entrants are more productive than can be explained by
the previous experience of their new employees, and non-entrants also benefit from knowledge
associated with new employees.
Further research could explore whether these relationships hold and are as strong in other
industries. Further work could also look at the less productive firms whose existence predates the
data period. The implications for policy depend on whether old firms have obsolete technology,
have market power and less incentive to innovative, or have simply grown complacent. Finally, it
would be interesting to investigate whether these patterns have persisted in more recent years
when the industry has been growing rapidly. It is possible that entrants and new employees who
are drawn into the industry when demand surges are different in nature from entrants and new
employees during more stable periods.

Notes: For construction firms in odd-years from 2005 to 2011 appearing in the BOS innovation module. All regressions also control for year and region fixed
effects. The sample is limited to firms sized at least 0.5. Standard errors, in parentheses, are robust and clustered at the firm level. Asterisks denote: *** p<0.01,

Figure 1: Job churn in construction

Notes: The job entry rate is the proportion of all construction jobs that are new. The job exit rate is the
proportion of all construction jobs that are ending and will not exist again. The job churn rate is the sum of the
entry and exit rates.

21

Figure 2: Proportion of labor in construction that is new

Notes: New labor includes both employee labor (FTE) and working proprietor labor. New labor from a given
area (construction or other industries) is calculated as a worker’s current labor input multiplied by the worker’s
total labor input last year in that area.

22

Figure 3: Past and future work of construction workers
(a) All workers in construction

(b) All new workers in construction entrant firms

Notes: Pooled across cohorts of construction workers from 2005-2010. A person must work at least 0.25 FTE
(or contribute any working proprietor labor) for a firm to be counted as working for that firm. When a person
works multiple jobs, we consider only the primary job with the highest yearly earnings.

Data Appendix
This study uses rich administrative data from Statistics New Zealand's IDI and LBD. To get
comprehensive data on construction firms and their workers, the core of our data comes from the
Employer Monthly Schedule (EMS), which shows all employer-employee relationships. The EMS
is derived from tax data; each month all employers must file a return with Inland Revenue
showing the employees working at the firm that month, the wages paid to them, and the tax
deducted.
We use the work of Fabling and Maré (2015a) to identify individuals who are working
proprietors at a firm. An individual is counted as a working proprietor if she: pays herself in the
EMS (the payer and payee identifiers are the same); reports self-employment income in the IR3
tax form; reports a share of partnership income in the IR7P tax form; or is a company owner
receiving payment in the IR4S tax form. Working proprietor relationships are assumed to be
permanent, though the labor input from a working proprietor can be zero in a particular year.
This identification allows us to separately consider the movements of employees and working
proprietors at construction firms. This is important because a large proportion of construction
firms in New Zealand are working-proprietor-only firms, and working proprietor relationships
may differ on important dimensions compared to employee relationships with firms.
Fabling and Maré (2015a) also provide a measure of employee FTE labor. These measures
tend to overestimate true labor input, because they identify FTE as less than 1 only if an
employee’s income is less than a full-time worker would make on the minimum wage. Despite
this, it is better than a simple headcount measure and is the best available labor measure in the
IDI.
To these core data we link in numerous other data sources from the IDI, to gain more
information on firms and their workers. This is outlined below.
Worker characteristics
Basic demographic information on employees and working proprietors comes from the
IDI’s core demographic table, which uses various sources for accuracy.20 From this, we capture
each worker’s age.
We also glean information on whether a worker was recently engaged in formal on-thejob training for trade jobs and apprenticeships. In New Zealand, Industry Training Organisations
(ITOs) arrange industry training by working with tertiary education providers. The IDI has
comprehensive ITO training data from 2003, showing which individuals were engaged in industry
training in a given year and which ITO organized the training.

This table is called ‘data.personal_detail’ in the IDI.

Further information on education comes from the Ministry of Education tertiary
education data in the IDI. These data show qualification enrolments and completions (from 1994),
as well as course enrolments (from 2001). In documenting the history of construction workers,
we simply classify a person as engaging in tertiary study if she studied at least half a full-time
equivalent year.
Customs data in the IDI show all border movements into and out of the country, and so
allow us to document overseas spells. In documenting the history of construction workers, we
classify a person as overseas if he spent at least half the year overseas. Visa data show all visas
that were approved, as well as the type of visa. This allows is to identify which workers in
construction are recent migrants, and whether they are here on a work visa or a resident visa.
Finally, we use the analysis and data from Maré and Hyslop (2006) and Maré, Hyslop and
Fabling (2017) to get measures of observed and unobserved skills for the employees in our data.
These come from regressions at the year-job level, where the dependent variable is an employee’s
log of earnings and the covariates are a set of worker fixed effects; a set of firm fixed effects; and
flexible controls for gender-year specific age profiles of earnings. Hence a worker fixed effect
represents the portable wage premium wherever a person works, and so constitute a data-driven
approach to measuring unobserved skill levels, while the gender-year specific age profiles provide
observed measures of skills. These are an important alternative to looking at qualifications, both
because qualifications data in the IDI is not comprehensive and because many differences in skill
sets between individuals are not captured by differences in qualifications. A person who is a
working proprietor can still have a worker fixed effect, if he ever works as an employee for
another firm. We do not focus on the skills of working proprietors, but we do consider separately
the average skills of new employees and new working proprietors to a firm.
Firm characteristics
Data on firm characteristics come from the LBD, a component of the IDI which contains a
variety of tax, administrative, and survey data on all economically active firms in New Zealand.21
We use the permanent firm identifiers created by Fabling (2011) to repair broken firm identifiers,
which ensures we can track the characteristics and workers of the same firm over time.
Most importantly for this study, each firm in the LBD is assigned a predominant industry,
using ANZSIC 2006 codes. These allow us to identify construction firms, as well as worker flows
between and within industries. We assign to each firm a permanent industry code, calculated as a
firm’s industry with the greatest share of employee-months.

See Fabling and Sanderson (2016) for details on Statistics New Zealand’s criteria for an enterprise to be considered
economically active.

Sample selection
The broadest estimation sample in this paper is all construction firms in the LBD that have
labor input in a given year, for the period 2001-2013. For many descriptive statistics and
regressions we limit this to firms in the period 2003-2012, to use firm productivity data and
capture the job history of workers new to a firm.
In our productivity analysis, we are limited to firms with useable production data. This
decreases the number of firm-year observations from around 550,000 to 360,000 over 20012012. As shown by Fabling and Maré (2015b), firms with useable production data in the LBD
account for around 60 percent of total industry gross output. In the year ending March 2012, the
specific proportions for construction were: 58 percent for ‘building construction’, 72 percent for
‘heavy and civil engineering construction’, and 50 percent for ‘construction services’. Firms
without production data tend to be small, though we cannot say anything about the productivity
of firms for which we lack production data.
