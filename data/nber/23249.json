    "abstract": "\n\nAmong stock market entrants, more firms over time are R&D\u2013intensive with initially lower profitability but higher growth potential. This sample-selection effect determines the secular trend in U.S. public firms\u2019 cash holdings. A stylized firm industry model allows us to analyze two competing changes to the selection mechanism: a change in industry composition and a shift toward less profitable R&D\u2013firms. The latter is key to generating higher cash ratios at IPO, necessary for the secular increase, whereas the former mechanism amplifies this effect. The data confirm the prominent role played by selection, and corroborate the model\u2019s predictions.\n\n",
