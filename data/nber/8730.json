    "abstract": "\n\nThe system of means-tested transfers in the U.S. has evolved in important ways over the last decade, with significant expansions of Medicaid , the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Supplemental Security Income program, and with significant contraction in Aid to Families with Dependent Children, now titled the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.  To determine where we are in our understanding of each of these programs, as well as the other major programs in the system of means-tested transfers, a volume is under preparation by the National Bureau of Economic Research that surveys the current structure and historical evolution of each of these programs and that synthesizes the results of the research that has been conducted on their economic effects. In addition to the AFDC-TANF, Medicaid,  EITC, and SSI programs, reviews have been conducted for the Food Stamp program and for housing, child care, job training, and child support programs.   This paper summarizes the results of those reviews and highlights the large number of important findings from existing research.\n\n",
