Do Employers Prefer Migrant Workers? Evidence from a Chinese Job Board
Peter Kuhn and Kailing Shen
NBER Working Paper No. 21675
October 2015
JEL No. J71,O15,R23
ABSTRACT
We study urban, private sector Chinese employers’ preferences between workers with and without
a local permanent residence permit (hukou) using callback information from an Internet job board.
We find that these employers prefer migrant workers to locals who are identically matched to the job’s
requirements; these preferences are strongest in jobs requiring lower levels of education and offering
low pay. While migrant-native payroll tax differentials might account for some of this gap, we argue
that the patterns are hard to explain without some role for a migrant productivity advantage in less
skilled jobs. Possible sources of this advantage include positive selection of nonlocals into migration,
negative selection of local workers into formal search for unskilled private sector jobs, efficiency wage
effects related to unskilled migrants’ limited access to the urban social safety net, and intertemporal
labor and effort substitution by temporary migrants that makes them more desirable workers.

1. Introduction
A common claim in popular discussions of migration is that employers prefer to hire
workers with limited residency rights –such as temporary or undocumented migrants—over
equally qualified natives, because these migrant workers are willing to work harder, for longer
hours, or for less pay. Such claims coexist with others arguing that employers discriminate
against migrants, either for taste-based reasons or out of a desire to protect native workers. 1 Yet
despite substantial literatures on the labor market outcomes of temporary and undocumented
migrants (e.g. Dustmann 2000, Kossoudji and Cobb-Clark 2001, Kahanec and Shields 2013), it
appears that no study has examined employers’ hiring choices between workers with different
residency rights in any jurisdiction. 2
This paper studies employers’ choices between workers with and without permanent
residency rights in a context that has been called the largest migration in human history (Chan,
2013). In 2010, the internal rural migrant population in China’s cities was estimated at 206
million persons, or about two thirds of the entire U.S. population (Chan 2012, Table 1). A
noteworthy feature of this migration is that unlike the U.S., and unlike many other developing
nations, Chinese people do not have the right to permanently reside in any part of the country.
Instead, each person is born with a city or province of permanent registration (hukou). While this
does not prevent people from migrating to other jurisdictions for temporary work, it places
severe limits on their ability to settle permanently in any location other than the one
corresponding to their birth hukou. Since a worker’s hukou status is relatively public
information, China’s internal migration system provides a unique laboratory in which to study
employers’ preferences between workers with different residency rights.
To that end, this paper uses internal data from XMRC, an Internet job board in Xiamen, a
medium-sized, prosperous Chinese city, to pose the following question: among equally qualified
local hukou (LH, or ‘native’) and non-local hukou (NLH, or ‘migrant’) candidates who have
applied for the same job, which applicants are more likely to receive an employer contact? Our
main finding is that employers on this job board, which caters to private-sector firms seeking
relatively skilled workers, prefer workers without a permanent residence permit over equallymatched permanent residents; specifically there is a difference in callback rates to the same job
of about 0.8 percentage points, or 11 percent. This gap is considerably larger in jobs requiring
lower levels of education and in jobs offering lower wages. While migrant-native payroll tax
differentials might account for some of this gap, we argue that the observed patterns are hard to
explain without some role for a migrant productivity advantage over natives, especially in less
skilled jobs. Higher levels of migrant productivity could stem from a number of sources,
including positive selection of nonlocals into migration, negative selection of local workers into
search for the unskilled private sector jobs that disproportionately employ migrants, efficiency

In part, this is because very few databases include information on individuals’ residency or visa status. Oreopoulos
(2011) studies Canadian employers’ choices between natives and persons with Asian-sounding names, but the latter
are predominantly permanent residents.

wage effects related to unskilled migrants’ limited access to the urban social safety net, and
intertemporal labor and effort substitution by temporary migrants that makes them more
desirable workers.
In addition to these substantive results, our paper makes three methodological
contributions. One is to illustrate the potential of large samples of naturally occurring
applications on Internet job boards to study the value of employee characteristics and credentials.
Compared to resume audit studies (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004, Oreopoulos 2011, Kroft et
al. 2013), job board data let us study large samples of applications and callbacks at very low
marginal cost. 3 These large samples allow researchers to generate estimates for a more
representative set of jobs, and to explore match effects between worker and job attributes in a
way that is not practical when one is creating and experimentally manipulating resumes.
Naturally occurring job board data also avoids the use of fictitious resumes, which can raise
issues of credibility in resume audit studies.
Job board data also reveal differences in application behavior between groups, allowing
us to estimate the effects of how workers direct their search on their callback rates. For example,
we show that migrants’ 11 percent callback advantage relative to equally qualified local
applicants to the same job (our analog to the quantity estimated by the resume audit approach)
substantially understates their advantage when still controlling for qualifications, but when not
conditioning on where they apply. This is because migrants, on average, apply to jobs that are
‘easier to get’ and that pay lower wages relative to their qualifications. More generally, whether
workers’ application choices accentuate or mitigate the callback gaps they face within ads has
implications for the labor market effects of employers’ callback choices, and cannot be studied
with standard resume audit methods.
A drawback of naturally-occurring job board data, of course, is the fact that the resume
characteristics we study are not randomly assigned. Thus, if employers base callback decisions
on worker characteristics they observe but we cannot hold constant, job-board-based estimates of
the ‘pure’ effects of any given resume characteristic may be biased. That said, if we evaluate our
approach with respect to the same criterion as resume audit studies –specifically, if the goal is to
measure how employers react to specific features of a resume-- the scope for omitted variable
bias with naturally occurring resumes is relatively limited. This is because callback decisions on
a job board (as opposed to hiring or pay decisions) are typically made only on the basis of
information contained in a worker’s resume. Thus, the only information about applicants that is
observed by employers but not controlled for in our regressions are the features of the worker’s
online resume that we have not fully been able to code into our vector of control variables. While
such aspects (such as formatting, grammar, unusual types of experience, etc.) certainly do exist,
they are probably less important than between-group differences in employers’ expectations of

3

Likely for cost reasons, resume audits tend to use quite constrained samples. Both Bertrand and Mullainathan
(2004) and Kroft et al. (2013) restrict their attention to four occupations: sales, administrative support, clerical, and
customer service. Oreopoulos (2011) considers more occupations, but restricts his attention to jobs that required
three to seven years of experience and an undergraduate degree, and to applications that possess those qualifications.

workers’ interview and job performance, which are not eliminated by randomizing group
membership on resumes. 4
A second methodological contribution is to illustrate the importance of the sample of jobs
that is used in empirical studies of groups’ relative success in the recruitment process. In
particular, job sampling plays a critical role whenever employers (or even jobs) specialize in
hiring different types of workers; imagine, for example, a situation where one group of workers
has preferential access to ‘good’ (e.g. high wage) jobs, while firms offering ‘bad’ jobs prefer to
hire the other worker type. 5 In such a world, there might be no difference between two groups in
their mean chances of getting a job offer, but both the size and sign of the offer or callback gap
can depend on the type of job being applied to. Thus, if the sample of jobs surveyed is
disproportionately ‘good’ (as it tends to be in existing audit studies) the results will overstate the
favored group’s advantage in securing an offer at a randomly selected job. On the other hand, if
the sample of jobs is disproportionately ‘bad’, we might see that the group with worse labor
market outcomes overall is preferred by employers. This is arguably what we observe in our
data, and does not necessarily indicate reverse discrimination, or even an absence of
discrimination in this labor market. In sum, estimated callback differentials are only relevant to
the sample of jobs studied. While this caveat applies both to resume audit studies and to job
board studies like ours, it is arguably more important in the former case because of the more
restricted sample of jobs for which credible, fictitious resumes can practically be designed.
Third, while it is common to hear claims that employers prefer to hire (say) migrant (or
female) workers “because they are cheaper”, to our knowledge no existing studies of the hiring
process consider the possible effects on callbacks of expected wage differences between workers
who are hired in response to the same job ad. Clearly, if employers expect to be able to pay
migrants (or women, or minorities) less, this could affect employers’ callback and hiring choices
between two equally qualified applicants in a way that has been hard to assess in existing work.
In this paper we take two approaches to bounding the effects of this form of (expected) wage
discrimination. One is to distinguish between job ads with and without posted wages (since
wage discrimination between worker types is arguably more difficult in posted-wage jobs). The
other takes advantage of information on the current wages reported by job applicants on their
resumes, which should place some bounds on the wages employers will have to pay to hire these
workers. In our case, neither method suggests that within-job wage discrimination against
migrants can account for their callback advantage. More generally, resume-based data on

4

While it is possible to shed some light on the role of these expectations by manipulating the amount of information
contained in resumes, both our approach and resume audit studies are probably best interpreted as estimates of how
employers ‘read’ resumes, i.e. as estimating the effects of learning that a person belongs to a certain group on the
probability of giving the worker a callback.

5

The simplest example of such a model is Becker’s (1971) model of taste-based employer discrimination. In that
(frictionless) model, employers have heterogeneous distastes for interacting with one of the two worker types. An
equilibrium wage gap clears the market and workers are segregated by type across employers. While neither group
has a hiring advantage overall –in the sense that both will be hired for sure if they apply to the ‘right’ job--, the
disfavored group will be turned away from the ‘good’ (high wage) jobs, and the favored group will be turned away
from the bad jobs if they apply there.

4
current wages help to bound the effects of expected within-job wage discrimination on callback
rates: a factor that has been largely ignored in the existing literature.
Section 2 provides some background on China’s hukou system, both nationally and as it
applies to our study city. Section 3 describes our data and methods while Section 4 presents the
main results. Section 5 discusses possible explanations of employers’ NLH preference while
Section 6 concludes.
2.

What is Hukou?

Hukou is the legal right to permanently reside in a Chinese province or city. 6 It is
inherited from a parent (historically the mother) regardless of where one is born, and is very hard
to change. For example, neither long periods of residence in a new location nor marriage to a
person of different hukou are sufficient to change one’s hukou. While Chinese workers are de
facto relatively free to take jobs in areas where they do not have a permanent residence permit,
both state and city governments have created a set of rules that distinguish between local hukou
(LH) and non-local hukou persons (NLH) in a number of key markets, including those for
housing, labor, education and health. Each province and city government also sets the rules for
how migrants can acquire a local hukou.
One main set of legal differences between LH and NLH persons in most Chinese
jurisdictions is in eligibility for government-provided benefits and services, especially education
and social insurance. For example in our study city, Xiamen, neither LH nor NLH children pay
elementary or junior middle school tuition, but LH children have priority in admissions. Seats
not filled by LH children are assigned by lottery among NLH children (Xiamen Education
Bureau, 2010), raising significant barriers for NLH children. Some other cities impose tuition
fees on NLH children; together these restrictions lead many NLH workers to leave their children
in the care of relatives in their home region, creating a generation of ‘left-behind’ children
(Démurger and Xu, 2013).
China’s social insurance programs, which are designed and administered by provincial
and city governments, typically provide much lower benefits to NLH workers, but also impose
lower payroll taxes on them. In Xiamen during our study period, LH and NLH workers were
treated identically in the unemployment insurance, worker’s compensation, and childbirth
benefits programs, but the two most important social insurance programs—retirement and
medical insurance—stipulated lower benefit and tax levels for NLH than for LH workers. At the
mean wage in our analysis sample (about 2300 RMB per month), the average payroll tax rate for
these two programs together was .31 for locals and .09 for migrants, of which .21 and .05 was
paid by employers (and the remaining .10 and .04 by workers.) We present additional details on
the structure of this tax differential in Section 5, since it could certainly affect employers’
choices between equally qualified LH and NLH applicants.
6

Additional details on the evolving structure of China’s hukou system are available in Chan and Buckingham
(2008); Bao, Bodvarsson, Hou and Zhao (2009); and Démurger and Xu (2013), on which we draw in this brief
description.

5
The second main set of legal distinctions between NLH and LH persons is a patchwork of
rules limiting migrants’ access to labor, real estate and some other markets. For example, before
and during our analysis period NLH persons could purchase a maximum of one apartment in
Xiamen (General Office of Xiamen People’s Government, 2013). 7 In Beijing, NLH workers
face barriers in entering the lotter for a car license plate (Beijing Municipal Transportation
Committee et al. 2013). A variety of formal and informal restrictions can also affect the types of
jobs NLH workers are allowed to take. While variable across cities and often hard to document
officially, a number of sources report explicit restrictions on hiring NLH persons as taxi drivers,
hotel front desk personnel, lawyers, and in Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in Beijing. 8 Some
state-owned enterprises, as well as provincial and city governments, are claimed to favor LH
workers, and occasionally will even announce explicit LH quotas. 9 While we have no hard
evidence of such restrictions in Xiamen, employment patterns (described below) suggest that LH
preferences may exist for government and SOE jobs there as well.
To provide some context for our analysis, the LH and NLH populations of China’s major
cities are described in Appendix Table 1, which is calculated from 2005 Census microdata. 10
Statistics specific to Xiamen are also shown. Overall, Appendix Table 1 documents four key
facts that are common to Xiamen and other major Chinese cities. First, NLH persons form a
majority of the working population: in Xiamen they constitute 61 percent of the employed
population and 70 percent of the private sector workers; in all Tier 1 and 2 cities as a group these
numbers are 57 and 73 percent. 11 Second, the urban NLH population is much younger and much
less educated than working-age natives; for example, 60 percent of Xiamen’s NLH working age
residents are age 35 or younger, compared to 39 percent of natives. Sixty-six percent of NLH
have at most a junior middle school education (9 years) compared to 46 percent of natives.
Third, urban NLH residents are much more attached to the labor market and work much
longer hours than natives. Employment rates (in the working-age population) are 83 percent for
working-age migrants compared to 68 percent for natives; one in three employed migrants in
Xiamen put in more than 56 hours per week compared to just 12 percent of employed natives.
Finally, consistent with the notion that NLH workers face barriers to public sector employment,
only 22 percent of employed migrants in China’s major cities work in the broader public sector
7

Such restrictions could impact the labor market via income effects from the apartment rental market, which is
reportedly an important income source for many LH persons.

See Li (2010) regarding lawyers and Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People’s Congress (2002)
regarding taxi drivers. Hukou-based requirements for hotel front desk personnel and KFC employment have been
claimed by a number of commentators on social media.
9

Aluminum Corporation of China (2012) is an ad for new college and university graduates placed by a large SOE.
The company advertises an explicit recruitment quota of 30 percent LH and 70 percent NLH, but adds the following
note at the bottom of the ad: “Note: Beijing students, education can be relaxed”.

10

“Major cities” are the four cities under direct central government control (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and
Chongqing), plus the fifteen sub-provincial cities, which include Xiamen. These city groups are sometimes referred
to informally as China’s “Tier 1” and “Tier 2” cities.
11

70 and 73 percent are the NLH share in private enterprises (the main employers on the XMRC job board) implied
by the employer type distribution in Appendix Table 1.

6
(government plus State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)), compared to 62 percent of employed urban
natives. As we shall argue, this tendency for urban natives to cluster in public sector jobs –which
is more muted but still very substantial in Xiamen- provides an important context for our results
in this paper, which apply to private sector employers only.

Data and Methods

3.1

Source and Sample Construction

With a 2010 Census population of 3.5 million, the city of Xiamen forms the center of a
prosperous metropolitan area of 16.8 million people on China’s southern coast. While
considerably smaller in population than Beijing and Shanghai, Xiamen’s income levels are
relatively close to those cities’, with 2010 GDP per capita at 58,337 RMB, compared to 75,943
and 76,074 RMB for Beijing and Shanghai respectively. In other respects, Appendix Table 1
shows that Xiamen is roughly representative of major cities in China; a very similar share of the
local population (27-28%) is college-educated, though Xiamen’s population is somewhat
younger and the public sector is considerably less important as an employer.
XMRC (http://www.xmrc.com.cn), the job board that is the source of our data, is a forprofit company sponsored by the Xiamen Personnel Bureau (a branch of the local government
devoted to the market for skilled labor). Since it was established in 2000, XMRC’s mandate has
been to be the main labor market intermediary serving skilled, private-sector workers in the
Xiamen metropolitan area. 12 XMRC operates like a typical U.S. job board, with both job ads and
resumes posted online. Workers and firms can contact each other to submit applications, arrange
interviews, etc., through the site. According to our conversations with job board executives in
other cities, XMRC is nationally recognized for its dominance in Xiamen; national competitors
did not attempt to establish a presence there until very recently, and have not had much success.
In part, XMRC’s dominance in Xiamen’s skilled labor market stems from its stable clientele of
local employers, who value good relations with XMRC managers, many of whom are also local
government officers. XMRC’s dominance is also facilitated by its physical location within
government offices providing employment and social-security related services to employers.
Our analysis sample is extracted from XMRC’s internal database, and is designed to
represent the inflow of new job ads during a window of time, plus all the applications that were
ever made to those ads. 13 Specifically, we asked XMRC to provide us with all the ads for jobs in
Xiamen that received their first application between May 1 and October 30, 2010. Then we
asked XMRC to provide us with all the resumes that applied to those ads, plus information on all
the firms that posted those ads. We also have a mapping of which resumes applied to which ads,
12

Recruiting for public sector and SOE jobs occurs via other channels. Recruiting for unskilled workers takes place
primarily via XMZYJS (the Xia-Zhang-Quan 3-city public job board www.xmzyjs.com), which is the only other
major job board based in Xiamen. XMZYJS is operated directly by the Xiamen Labor Bureau, a local government
department focusing on unskilled workers. It does not post worker resumes and does not provide a mechanism for
firms and workers to contact each other through their website.
13

This approach eliminates the problem of length-biased sampling that would apply to a sample of the stock of ads
on the site during an interval of time.

7
and a record of which resumes were subsequently contacted by each firm through the XMRC
website. Receiving such a contact is our indicator of worker success in the hiring process. 14 To
ensure that we capture all contacts resulting from applications made during our sampling
window, we continued to monitor all the ads posted during that window until January 13, 2011
(74 days after Oct. 30 2010). Most contacts occur very quickly, however (within 2 weeks of
application). Finally, since our interest is in which workers are selected by firms for interviews or
employment, the sample of ads used in this paper excludes ads that never resulted in any
employer contacts via the XMRC site. 15
Other criteria used in constructing our analysis sample include dropping ads with a
minimum requested age below 18 or a maximum requested age over 60; ads offering more than
10,000 yuan/month; ads requesting a master’s, professional or PhD degree (all of these were
rare); ads for more than 10 vacancies, ads for jobs located outside the city of Xiamen, and ads
with missing firm information. We also dropped resumes listing a current wage above 10,000
yuan/month, with missing hukou information or with non-Chinese citizenship, as well as
applications that couldn’t be matched to both an ad and a resume. Finally, we dropped a small
number of ads for jobs in State-Owned Enterprises and Not-for-Profit organizations. Despite
being a substantial share of employment in Xiamen, ads for SOE jobs are very rare on XMRC, as
most recruiting for these positions goes through other channels. Thus our results refer to hiring
for private-sector jobs only.
3.2

Descriptive Statistics

Our data consist of 221,135 applications made by 78,031 workers (resumes) to 3,489 ads
placed by 1,551 firms, resulting in 18,731 callbacks. Thus, a typical ad received about 63
applications, of which 5.4 were contacted by the employer. Means in this sample are presented in
Table 1, separately for applications from workers with local and non-local hukou. 16
As a comparison of Table 1 and Appendix Table 1 makes clear, applications in our
XMRC sample are not representative of Xiamen’s employed population. 17 Specifically, our
sample has a much larger share of young, highly educated, and migrant workers than Xiamen’s
2005 workforce. The much higher levels of education in our sample are consistent with XMRC’s
mandate to serve skilled workers, with the massive expansion of higher education in China
between 2005 and 2010 (Shen and Kuhn 2013), and with the fact that educated jobseekers are
14

Since only about 8 percent of applications in our sample result in employer contacts, we interpret these contacts as
a relatively strong interest on the firm’s part in hiring the worker. Conversations with XMRC officials support this
interpretation, as does evidence in all our regressions (detailed below) that the probability of contact is strongly and
positively related to the quality of the match between workers’ characteristics and the job’s advertised requirements.
15

No contacts could mean the firm didn’t hire during our observation period, or they contacted successful workers
using means other than the job board.
16

LH in Table 1 and throughout our main analysis denotes Xiamen city hukou only; workers with Fujian province
(but not Xiamen) hukou are treated as NLH because their legal status in the city is the same as workers from other
provinces.
17

Unfortunately, 2005 is the most recent Chinese Census data available to us.

8
more likely to look for work online than less-educated jobseekers (Kuhn and Mansour, 2014).
The high share of young and migrant workers is consistent with the fact that our XMRC data is a
sample of job applications, not of employed persons; not only do young workers tend to change
jobs more frequently than older workers (Topel and Ward 1992), our data contain a significant
share of new labor market entrants. The very high share of migrant applications in our data-91.9 percent (203,239 / 221,135), compared to migrants’ 70 percent share of Xiamen’s 2005
employed private sector workers-- is consistent with a scenario in which migrants search for new
jobs on arrival in Xiamen and one where prospective migrants look for work on XMRC while
still living elsewhere. 18
In addition to applicants’ age, education and hukou, our data also include measures of
their experience (total years and number of spells), sex, current wage, marital status, height, an
indicator for myopia, the number of schools attended, whether an English version of the resume
was available, number of job spells listed, and number of certifications listed. For each
application, we also have data on the requirements listed by employers in the job ad, including
the desired education, experience, age and gender. 19 The typical job ad requested about 13 years
of education, around a year less than the average education level of the applicants. Over half the
job ads stipulated a desired age, with a mean of 27 (about 2.4 years older than the typical
applicant). About 59 percent of job ads posted a wage, and the mean posted wage (2362
yuan/month) is about 4.4 percent higher than the mean current wage listed by workers (2261) in
their resumes. Our data also have an indicator for the number of positions that were available
(about 2 on average), and we can measure the number of applications each application is
competing with.20 Finally, we have indicators of firm ownership, head office location, and size
(number of employees) as well as firm identifiers.
While most of the differences between LH and NLH workers and the jobs they are
applying to in Table 1 are statistically significant due to the large sample sizes, most of the
differences are quantitatively small and in the expected direction for migrant versus non-migrant
populations. Specifically, NLH and LH applicants are equally well educated, but are younger,
less experienced, more likely to be new graduates, more male, and are less likely to be married
than LH applicants. Consistent with being younger, NLH are applying to jobs that request
somewhat younger workers and require slightly less experience. Finally, the first row of Table 1
shows that NLH applicants are substantially more likely than LH applicants to receive an
employer callback: 7.2 percent of applicants with local hukou are contacted by firms’ HR
departments when they apply for a job, compared to 8.6 percent for NLH workers, a gap of 19
percent.
18

While we know the location of our applicants’ hukous, our confidentiality agreement with XMRC prevents us
from knowing where applicants are located when they apply to jobs on the website.
19

See Kuhn and Shen (2013) and Delgado Helleseter, Kuhn and Shen (2014) for an analysis of explicit gender
targeting in Chinese job ads, which is quite common.
20

An average application was competing with about 189 others in our sample. Note that this is a different concept
than the number of applications received by a typical ad, which we have already noted is about 64.

3.3

Estimation Framework—Interpreting Recall Regressions

To assess whether other observed characteristics can account for the NLH contact
advantage in Table 1, we estimate linear probability regressions for contacts as a function of the
characteristics of the firm placing the ad, the characteristics of the ad itself (primarily the stated
job requirements and the employer’s preferred employee demographics), the match between the
job’s requirements and the applicant’s characteristics, the level of other applicant qualifications
that are not specifically requested in the ad, and the amount of competition for the job (number
of applicants and number of positions available). 21
Since native and migrant workers are treated differently by the payroll tax system in
many jurisdictions, and since it is often claimed that migrants’ lower wage costs make them
more attractive to employers, the rest of this section develops an interpretive framework for
callback regressions that incorporates possible labor cost differentials, which are not typically
considered in studies of the hiring process, including resume audits. As a starting point, we
suppose that the probability that an application from worker i to job j receives an employer
contact is approximated by the linear relationship:
𝑃𝑖𝑖 = 𝑎 + 𝑏(𝑞𝑖𝑖 − 𝑤𝑖𝑖 − 𝑡𝑖 − 𝑑𝑀𝑖 − 𝜃𝑗 ) + 𝑒𝑖𝑖

(1)

where 𝑞𝑖𝑖 is the firm’s expectation of worker i’s productivity in job j based on the
contents of the resume, 𝑤𝑖𝑖 is the wage the firm expects to pay to worker i in job j, 𝑡𝑖 is the
employer portion of the payroll tax for that worker, d measures employers’ net distaste for
migrants, 𝑀𝑖 is an indicator for migrant status (NLH), 𝜃𝑗 is an ad-specific expected-quality
threshold for contacting a worker, b>0 is a scaling parameter, and 𝑒𝑖𝑖 is an iid error term. 22
Suppose further that
𝑞𝑖𝑖 = 𝑋𝑖𝑖 𝛽 + 𝜀𝑖𝑖

(2)

where 𝑋𝑖𝑖 includes measures of the job’s requirements, the match between the worker’s
qualifications and those requirements, plus additional indicators of the worker’s absolute ability.
Unobserved employer expectations of how productive the worker is likely to be in the job are
1
captured by 𝜀𝑖𝑖 . It is worth noting that 𝜀𝑖𝑖 has two conceptually distinct components. One, 𝜀𝑖𝑖
,
consists of resume features that employers see, but which we have not been able to code into our
vector of control variables, 𝑋𝑖𝑖 . This component is held constant in resume audit studies but not
21

We use linear probability models rather than, say, probits, because our most saturated specifications use large
numbers of fixed effects (one for each job ad), raising computational issues as well as concerns with consistency in
the presence of a large number of incidental parameters.
22

Only the employer portion of the payroll tax enters equation (1) because the equation controls for the wage that is
paid to the worker. This does not rule out shifting of the employer tax onto workers via endogenous adjustments in
wages. In particular, if employers pay higher taxes on LH workers and some or all of that tax differential is shifted
onto them, wages for LH workers will be reduced relative to NLH workers. This would be reflected in a lower value
of 𝑤𝑖𝑖 in (1), which has the effect of canceling out some or all of the effect of LH workers’ higher tax rate on firms’
hiring decisions. We discuss how the interpretation of our results depends on assumptions about tax shifting below.

10

in studies like ours that use naturally-occurring resumes. The second, 𝜀𝑖𝑖
, includes both an iid
component of match quality and employers’ forecasts of employee productivity from resume
characteristics, 𝑋𝑖𝑖 and 𝑀𝑖 . These forecasts are not held constant in either estimation approach.
Importantly, then, both our results and those of resume audit studies are best interpreted as
estimates of how employers react to resumes, where those reactions include both employer tastes
and forecasts (whether biased or unbiased) of future productivity based on observable features of
the resume.

We describe employer payroll taxes by:
𝑡𝑖 = 𝑡 𝑁 − ∆𝑡 𝑀𝑖

(3)

where ∆𝑡 = 𝑡 𝑁 − 𝑡 𝑀 ≥ 0 is migrants’ payroll tax advantage.

Finally, the effect of expected wages on the callback decision depends on the firm’s
wage-setting process. To explore this, we consider two cases, beginning with the case of posted
wages (Doeringer and Piore 1971; Burdett and Mortensen 1998; Lang, Manove and Dickens
2005).
Case 1: Posted Wages
If wages are completely tied to jobs, expected wages can be written as:
𝑤𝑖𝑖 = 𝑤
�𝑗

(4)

In this case, workers who are hired in response to the same ad must be paid the same
wage. This assumption is typically maintained (either explicitly or implicitly) in resume audit
studies, since otherwise the studies would not be informative about employers’ preferences
Substituting (2)-(4) into (1), the callback probability in Case 1 can be expressed as:
�𝑗 + 𝜃𝑗 ]
𝑃𝑖𝑖 = [𝑎 − 𝑏𝑡 𝑁 ] − 𝑏(𝑑 − ∆𝑡 )𝑀𝑖 + 𝑏𝑋𝑖𝑖 𝛽 − 𝑏[𝑤
+ [𝑒𝑖𝑖 +𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 ].

(5)

A key insight from (5) is that ad fixed effects, 𝑏[𝑤
�𝑗 + 𝜃𝑗 ], will absorb any differences
across firms and jobs in hiring standards, 𝜃𝑗 . More importantly, while it seems intuitive that
employers might prefer migrants “because they are cheap”, equation (5) makes it clear that the
sizable native-migrant wage differentials that are measured in regression studies of Chinese
survey data are not for the most part relevant to the callback gaps estimated in this paper. 23 This
is because all native-migrant wage gaps associated with the possibility that migrants
disproportionately apply to (and ultimately work in) low-wage jobs are also absorbed in our ad
fixed effects, −𝑏[𝑤
�𝑗 + 𝜃𝑗 ].
23

Survey-based studies of the migrant-native wage gap in China include Meng and Zhang (2001), Lu (2008) and
Xing (2014), all of whom find that migrants earn less than natives in urban China even after controlling for the usual
observable worker characteristics. Importantly, however, Meng and Zhang, among others, find the gap is
substantially reduced when controls for employer type (specifically, public sector and SOE) are introduced.

11
Summarizing Case 1, we have:
Result 1: The migrant-native hiring gap when wages are attached to jobs
When two workers who are hired in response to the same job ad must be paid the same
wage, the estimated migrant-native callback gap in the presence of job ad fixed effects will be
given by:
𝐺𝐺𝐺1 = −𝑏𝑏 + 𝑏∆𝑡 + 𝑏 𝜕𝜀𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝜕𝑀𝑖

(6)

where 𝜕𝜀𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝜕𝑀𝑖 is the partial regression coefficient of unobserved applicant quality on
migrant status, controlling for all the remaining observables in (5).■

In sum, when wages are attached to jobs, the employer share –and only the employer
share—of payroll taxes affects which workers we expect firms to pick from an applicant pool. In
consequence, the estimated coefficient on 𝑀𝑖 in the presence of ad fixed effects reflects the net
impact of three factors: employers’ tastes for hiring migrant workers, -bd, which we expect to
reduce migrants’ callback rates; migrants’ payroll tax advantage, 𝑏∆𝑡 , which we expect to raise
migrants’ callback rates; and any uncontrolled migrant-native differences in expected
productivity, 𝑏 𝜕𝜀𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝜕𝑀𝑖 .
Case 2: Adding within-job wage differentials

To see how the above conclusions change when there is wage variation between workers
who have been hired for the same job, we consider two possible sources of within-job wage
variation. The first corresponds to shifting of the employer portion of the payroll tax onto
workers. To incorporate within-job tax shifting, we replace (4) by:
𝑤𝑖𝑖 = 𝑤𝑖𝑖∗ − 𝜑𝑡𝑖

(7)

where 𝑤𝑖𝑖∗ is the wage that would be paid in the absence of a payroll tax and 0 ≤ 𝜑 ≤ 1 is a passthrough parameter. If 𝜑 = 1, the entire employer portion of payroll taxes is passed on to workers
in the form of lower wages, while 𝜑 = 0 corresponds to zero pass-through. 24
If taxes are described by (3) it follows that
𝑤𝑖𝑖 = 𝑤𝑖𝑖∗ − 𝜑𝑡 𝑁 + 𝜑∆𝑡 𝑀𝑖 .

(8)

According to (8), the effect of within-job shifting of employer payroll taxes is to reduce
natives’ wages below migrants’, since part of natives’ higher employer tax cost is now passed on
to them. One way this might occur is if wages are bargained after a hiring decision is made, as in
Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), a situation which is more common in skilled jobs (Brencic
24

In addition to institutional factors, the amount of pass through may also depend on how much workers value the
public health and retirement benefits their higher taxes buy (Summers 1989). For example, if LH workers place a
high value on these benefits, employers will find it easier to ask them to accept a lower wage than migrants who are
not entitled to the same benefits. The only effect on our analysis is on the value of, since employers care only about
the relative wages, tax costs, and productivity of two workers when choosing whom to hire for the job.

12
2012). Another possibility is that firms advertise a wage that is appropriate for one class of
worker (say, NLH), with the understanding that LH applicants are expected to accept a lower
wage to compensate for their higher tax costs. 25
A second possible source of within-job wage differentials for new hires is related to
employer monopsony power. If, on average, migrants have less attractive labor market
alternatives than natives, employers in a world without payroll taxes might be able to pay
migrants less than equally-productive natives (Hotchkiss and Quispe-Agnoli 2009, Depew et al.
2013, Hirsch and Jahn 2015). To model this, let the baseline wage, 𝑤𝑖𝑖∗ , in (7) equal 𝑤𝑗𝑁∗ + 𝜈𝑖

for natives and 𝑤𝑗𝑀∗ + 𝜈𝑖 for migrants, where 𝜈𝑖 captures idiosyncratic worker bargaining power
that is uncorrelated with migrant status. It follows that
𝑤𝑖𝑖∗ = 𝑤𝑗𝑁∗ − ∆𝑤∗ 𝑀𝑖 + 𝜈𝑖 ,

(9)

𝑤𝑖𝑖 = [𝑤𝑗𝑁∗ − 𝜑𝑡 𝑁 ] + (𝜑∆𝑡 − ∆𝑤∗ )𝑀𝑖 + 𝜈𝑖

(10)

where ∆𝑤∗ = 𝑤𝑗𝑁∗ − 𝑤𝑗𝑀∗ is the monopsony-related cost advantage of hiring migrants, which is
positive if migrants have worse outside options. Combining (8) and (9) yields:
In this more general setting, the wage the employer expects to pay is the sum of a jobspecific intercept [𝑤𝑗𝑁∗ − 𝜑𝑡 𝑁 ], a term representing idiosyncratic worker wage bargaining
power 𝜈𝑖 , and a within-job migrant wage differential (𝜑∆𝑡 − ∆𝑤∗ )𝑀𝑖 . This latter term represents
the net impact of shifting of employer tax rates onto workers (which tends to raise migrants’
wages relative to natives) and a monopsony effect, which we expect to have the opposite effect.
Substituting (10) into (1) yields:
𝑃𝑖𝑖 = [𝑎 − 𝑏𝑡 𝑁 (1 − 𝜑)] − 𝑏[𝑑 − ∆𝑡 (1 − 𝜑) − ∆𝑤∗ ]𝑀𝑖 + 𝑏𝑋𝑖𝑖 𝛽 − 𝑏[𝜃𝑗 + 𝑤𝑗𝑁∗ ]
+ [𝑒𝑖𝑖 +𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 − 𝑏𝜈𝑖𝑖 ].

(11)

Summarizing Case 2,

Result 2: The migrant-native hiring gap with within-job wage differentials
When two workers who are hired in response to the same job ad can be paid different
wages, the estimated migrant-native callback gap in the presence of job ad fixed effects will be
given by:
𝐺𝐺𝐺2 = −𝑏𝑏 + 𝑏∆𝑡 + 𝑏(∆𝑤∗ − 𝜑∆𝑡 ) + 𝑏 𝜕𝜀𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝜕𝑀𝑖 .

(12)

Compared to (6), (12) has two additional terms reflecting the effect of within-job wage
differentials (if any) between natives and migrants. One of these, 𝑏∆𝑤∗ , is the effect of any
additional monopsony power employers might have over migrant workers, due to their poorer
labor market alternatives. Any such power should reduce the wage employers expect to pay
25

Adjusting wages to shift employer taxes onto workers is illegal in Xiamen, though it is unclear how strongly this
prohibition is enforced.

13
migrant workers relative to natives, thereby raising (i.e. helping to explain) migrants’ callback
advantage. The other, −𝑏𝑏∆𝑡 , reflects shifting of natives’ payroll tax disadvantage into the
wages paid to natives. Any such shifting should increase migrants’ relative wage costs
(compared to the posted-wages baseline), thereby reducing (i.e. making it harder to explain)
migrants’ callback advantage. In the following section, we shall argue that it is possible to bound
the relative magnitude of these two factors by looking at data on the current wages of job
applicants. Notably, as is formalized in equation (12), a situation where these two factors just
balance each other is observationally identical to the much simpler case where wages are tied to
jobs (Case 1).

Results

Table 2 presents linear probability estimates of equation (11), where the dependent
variable equals one if the applicant was contacted by the firm’s HR department after applying to
the ad. 26 Column 1 contains no regressors other than NLH; it replicates Table 1’s finding that on
average, NLH workers were 1.4 percentage points (or 19 percent) more likely to receive an
employer contact than LH workers. 27 Column 2 adds controls for basic characteristics of the job
ad (specifically the requested levels of education, age, experience, gender, and whether a new
graduate or technical school graduate is sought), plus measures of the match between those
characteristics and the worker’s actual characteristics (𝑋𝑖𝑖 ). Also included are controls for the
advertised wage, the worker’s gender, and the worker’s technical school and new graduate status.
Column (2) shows that workers who are older than the job’s preferred age range and of a
different gender than the firm requests are significantly less likely to receive a callback than
workers who meet these hiring criteria.
Column 3 adds controls for a more detailed set of CV characteristics that are available in
our data. These are whether the applicant attended a technical school, the applicant’s zhicheng
rank (6 categories), whether the CV is in English, the number of schools attended, the number of
job experience spells, and the number of certifications reported. 28 The following characteristics
are also included, both as main effects and interacted with the applicant’s gender: myopia,
height, and marital status. Occupation fixed effects (for the job) are added in column 4. Column
26

Applications that were contacted via methods other than the website (such as telephone) are treated as not being
contacted in our data. This could be an issue if firms tend to use different methods to contact LH versus NLH
workers. We explored this issue in discussions with XMRC officials, who stated that this was highly unlikely. The
marginal financial cost of contacting an applicant anywhere in China is zero both by telephone and via the site, and
recruiters generally find it easiest to issue all callbacks to the same job in the same way.
27

The standard errors in Table 2 adjust for correlation among applications to the same ad by clustering on ads; this
handles a substantial share of the likely error correlations in our data since the typical ad received about 63
applications. To explore the effects of within-applicant error correlations on the significance of our estimates (which
are likely much smaller since the average resume applied to only 2.8 jobs) we replicated our main results on a
sample consisting of one randomly-selected application from each worker. There was very little change.
28

Zhicheng is a nationally-recognized worker certification system that assigns an official rank (from one through
six) to workers in almost every occupation. While education and experience play key roles in many occupations’
zhicheng ranking schemes, several professions also use government-organized nationwide or province-wide exams
both to qualify for and to maintain one’s zhicheng rank.

14
5 adds two indicators of the amount of competition for the job in question, specifically the
number of positions available and the number of persons who applied to the ad. Both of these
indicators have strong effects in the expected directions; adding them increases the estimated
NLH effect somewhat. Overall, however, between columns 1 and 5 there is some attenuation in
the NLH coefficient as controls are added, reducing the size of the estimated effect from 1.38
percentage points in column 1 to 1.13 percentage points in column 5. Intuitively, this attenuation
is accounted for by the fact that NLH workers apply to jobs to which they are somewhat better
matched (column 1 to 2) and are slightly more qualified in terms of detailed resume
characteristics (column 3). 29
Column 6 replaces the occupation fixed effects by fixed effects for job cells, defined as
the interaction of firms and (requested) occupations. Thus, column 6 compares observationally
identical LH and NLH workers who have applied for a job in the same occupation in the same
firm (though not necessarily in response to the same ad). This reduces the estimated size of the
NLH effect substantially (to 0.81 percentage points). It follows that part of the unadjusted NLH
advantage in column 1 (at least (.0113-.081)/.0138 = 23 percent) results from a tendency for
NLH workers to disproportionately apply to job cells with higher overall callback rates. 30 Thus,
as argued earlier, group differentials in callback rates depend on the sample of job ads that is
considered; in our case the overall callback advantage of NLH workers is explained, in part, by
the fact that they disproportionately apply to jobs that are “easier to get”.
Our most saturated specification in column 7 replaces column 6’s job cell fixed effects
with a full set of job ad fixed effects, thus effectively comparing the success rates of LH and
NLH workers who have applied to the same ad. As noted earlier, column 7’s fixed effects absorb
any wage that is attached to the job as well as job-specific hiring standards. These estimates are
identified only by the sample of job ads that received at least one NLH applicant and one LH
applicant. Compared to column 6, they leave the NLH coefficient essentially unchanged. An
interesting feature of columns 6 and 7 is that several indicators of job-worker mismatch
(specifically whether the worker is less educated than requested, younger than requested, and
less experienced than requested) that were insignificant in less saturated specifications are now
associated with highly significant reductions in callbacks. Part of this effect is due to a reduction
in standard errors relative to columns 2-5, suggesting that focusing on within-ad competition for
jobs improves the precision of our estimates.
Comparing columns (1) and (7), the NLH coefficient attenuates by .58 percentage points
(.0138 - .0079) between columns 1 and 7, which might be a cause for concern if there are
important features of workers’ resumes we have not adequately been able to code into our
control variables. Importantly, however, note that only .13 points (or 22 percent) of this
attenuation (i.e. the gap between columns 2 and 3) results from adding finer controls for resume
29

The column 5 coefficient is essentially identical to the column 3 coefficient because NLH apply to higher-callback
occupations (column 4), but to individual ads where there is more competition for the job (column 5).
30

Some search models of discrimination, such as Lang, Manove and Dickens (2005) have the property that in
equilibrium, groups that anticipate encountering discrimination in the hiring process direct their search towards
lower-wage jobs, which may be easier to get.

15
characteristics. The remainder results from increasingly detailed controls for where applicants
are directing their applications. Thus, as argued earlier, naturally occurring job board data
provides information on how overall gaps in job search success between groups of workers are
affected by those workers’ directed search strategies. According to Table 2, the within-job hiring
gap of .8 percentage points in column (7) understates the aggregate gap of .14 percentage points
in column (1) because migrant workers choose to target their job applications less aggressively
than local workers, focusing on jobs that are on average ‘easier to get’. From a welfare point of
view, it is not clear whether column (1) or column (7) is more relevant.
In sum, Table 2 presents evidence that NLH workers have a higher chance of receiving
an employer callback than observationally-equivalent LH workers when both groups of workers
are competing for the same private-sector job. In our most saturated specification, NLH workers
have a callback advantage of 0.8 percentage points, or 11 percent, an effect which is highly
statistically significant. In the following Section, we consider the plausibility of various
explanations for this gap by exploring how the size of the gap varies across types of ads, firms
and workers.
5.

What Explains Firms’ Preferences for NLH Workers?

According to equation (12) there are four broad types of factors that could explain NLH
workers’ callback advantage: employers’ tastes (-d); the direct effect of LH workers’ higher
payroll taxes, ∆𝑡 ; within-job wage gaps between LH and NLH workers (∆𝑤∗ − 𝜑∆𝑡 ); and the
possibility that migrants are on average more productive than observationally identical natives
(𝜕𝜀𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝜕𝑀𝑖 ). The first of these is not a likely explanation of the NLH callback advantage, since
available evidence from other sources suggests that if anything Chinese urban residents are either
indifferent or have some distastes for interacting with non-local workers (Dulleck, Fooken and
He 2012). In the remainder of this Section, we draw on various pieces of evidence to attempt to
assess the importance of the remaining three.
5.1

Payroll tax differentials

If NLH workers’ payroll tax advantage is the main explanation of their higher callback
rate, one would expect their callback advantage to be most pronounced in situations where their
payroll tax advantage is the greatest. To pursue this idea, note that during our sample period
employers of LH workers in Xiamen paid 21 percent of the worker’s monthly salary (with a
minimum and maximum basis) to city’s retirement and health insurance programs. For NLH
workers, these contributions were set at a fixed, low amount that is unrelated to the worker’s
wage rate. The exact formulas and their consequences for average tax rates at typical salaries in
our sample are shown in Appendix Table 2, which shows a roughly constant employer tax rate
gap of about 19 percent between the two worker types across the entire wage distribution in our
sample (column 3). The absolute tax differential in column (4), on the other hand, increases with
earnings. Both these properties also apply to total (employer plus employee-paid) taxes (in
columns 5-8). Thus, depending on whether the total tax difference (in yuan) or the difference in

16
tax rates is most relevant to employers’ callback decisions, NLH workers’ payroll tax advantage
is either increasing or roughly constant across job skill levels.
To see if NLH workers’ callback advantage conforms to either of these patterns across
skill levels, Table 3 estimates a different effect of NLH status on the callback rate for four levels
of required education, while Table 4 does the same for four advertised wage bins. For both
wages and education levels we find the opposite pattern from what is predicted by NLH workers’
payroll tax advantage: firms’ revealed preferences for NLH workers are considerably stronger at
low skill levels than higher ones. With respect to education, the NLH advantage is strongest –at
1.7 percentage points-- in jobs requiring junior middle school (9 years of education), much
smaller (0.9 points) in jobs requiring senior middle or tech school, 0.6 percentage points in
college-level jobs, and small and insignificant for university-level jobs. For advertised wage
levels, the trend is similar: the NLH hiring advantage is highly statistically significant, at 1.4
percentage points, in jobs advertising a wage below 2000 RMB per month, half that size in jobs
paying 2000-4000 RMB per month, and absent at higher wage levels.
Overall, the fact that the NLH hiring advantage in our data is strongly concentrated
among less-skilled and low-paid jobs is inconsistent with a scenario in which statutory payroll
tax differences between LH and NLH workers are the only explanation of the callback gap. 31 At
a minimum, one or more additional factors, which disproportionately make less-skilled NLH
workers more attractive to employers, must also be at work. We discuss a number of such factors
in the remainder of this Section.
5.2

Within-job Wage Differentials

Equation (12) indicates that NLH workers’ relative callback rates should also depend on
any expected wage differentials between NLH and LH workers who are hired in response to the
same job ad. If within-job wage gaps primarily reflect payroll tax shifting, we would expect
natives to be paid less than migrants; this would reduce the relative attractiveness of migrant
workers and cancel out some or all of the direct effect of employer-paid payroll taxes. On the
other hand if monopsonistic wage discrimination against migrants dominates, we would expect
natives to be paid more than migrants, which would raise migrants’ relative attractiveness. If
these two factors roughly cancel each other out, or if within-job wage discrimination is not
possible, we should not see within-job wage gaps between natives and migrants, and they cannot
help us explain the NLH callback advantage.
We do not, of course, observe whether employers expect or plan to pay different wages to
LH and NLH workers who apply to the same job in our data. Still, two features of our data help
us place some bounds on the likely effects of these types of wage gaps. One is that we can
distinguish between job ads that did or did not post a wage; if it is harder to wage discriminate
between worker types when a wage is posted in the job ad we should see a different callback gap
31

Some commentators on this paper have suggested that payroll tax noncompliance among employers of unskilled
NLH workers might help account for those workers’ stronger NLH callback advantage. The very low statutory NLH
tax rates in Table 1, however, imply that even complete noncompliance (zero taxes) among migrants’ employers
would not substantially alter the skill profile of the NLH tax advantage.

17
in the two types of jobs. (The sign of the difference depends, again, on ∆𝑤∗ − 𝜑∆𝑡 ). To see if this
is the case, we estimated callback regressions that interact the NLH effect with whether the job
ad posted a wage. 32 No statistically significant interaction effects were estimated in any
specification. Second, recall as Table 1 indicates that almost 70 percent of applicants list a
current wage on their resume. If the wage currently earned by a job applicant is a rough lower
bound for what a firm must pay to hire that applicant, the current wage will give us some
indication of the scope available to employers to pay different wages to NLH and LH workers
who have applied to the same job.
Table 5 presents NLH coefficients from the same regressions as our main results (in
Table 2), but where the dependent variable is the log of the worker’s current wage as listed on
their XMRC profile. To allow us to focus on the job types where the NLH hiring advantage is
present, Table 5 estimates separate applicant wage differentials for jobs requiring below versus
above 12 years of education, and for jobs posting a wage below versus above 4,000 yuan per
month. Focusing first on the raw data in column 1, we see (as one might expect) that NLH
workers applying to less skilled and low paying jobs have current wages that are below those
earned by native applicants. Interestingly, the opposite is true for NLH workers applying to
highly skilled, high paying jobs. NLH university graduates seeking work in Xiamen have very
good current jobs compared to Xiamen’s local university-educated applicants.
More importantly, comparing equally-qualified workers who have applied to the same
jobs (which is the relevant comparison for understanding our main result) column 7 shows a very
different pattern. In applicant pools for skilled jobs, the current wages of NLH applicants are the
same as those of native applicants. In applicant pools for unskilled jobs, however, the current
wages of NLH applicants are two to four percent higher than natives. Again, this is because
migrants target their applications a little less aggressively (in terms of wages relative to their
current wage) than natives. The implication for employers of less-skilled workers on XMRC is
that employers who want to match the wages their applicants are currently earning elsewhere
would need, on average, to pay a migrant two to four percent more than natives. This strongly
suggests that lower migrant wages within jobs are an unlikely explanation of the NLH callback
advantage. Further, such a two to four percent wage discount for natives contrasts with a direct
additional employer payroll tax bill (from Appendix Table 2) of 16 to 19 percent. Thus, it seems
highly unlikely that firms will be able to pay natives sufficiently less than migrants within jobs to
undo migrants’ payroll tax advantage.
In sum, if applicants’ current wages set meaningful constraints on what firms must pay to
hire workers, within-job wage discrimination against migrants is not a likely explanation of the
NLH hiring advantage. Applicants’ current wages also suggest that within-job payroll tax
shifting onto natives would not be able to undo much more than a small fraction of natives’
higher direct payroll tax costs. Together, this means we can largely ignore the component of
GAP2 related to within-job wage differentials, 𝑏(∆𝑤∗ − 𝜑∆𝑡 ), leaving only the direct effect of
32

Admittedly, this is a rather weak test since our wage measures come in bins that are quite wide. This would leave
considerable room for negotiation within a pre-announced wage bin.

18
employer payroll taxes and productivity differentials as remaining candidate explanations for the
NLH callback advantage.
5.3

Productivity Gaps—Selection

We now turn to the final term in equation (12): the possibility that employers expect
migrants to be on average more productive than observationally identical natives when making
callback decisions (𝜕𝜀𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝜕𝑀𝑖 > 0). We can think of a number of reasons why this might be the
case, and can only provide a few pieces of evidence regarding which ones might be most
relevant. Sources of migrant-native productivity gaps fall into two main categories, the first of
which is selection, i.e. uncontrolled productivity differentials that are time-invariant features of
the employee.
One possible source of differential selection is the notion that NLH migrants may be
perceived by employers as being positively selected relative to their compatriots who chose to
remain behind in poorer parts of China (Borjas 1987). An important caveat to this explanation,
however, is the fact that positive selection relative to stayers in the origin region does not imply
positive selection relative to natives in the destination city. Indeed, if anything, we would
probably expect NLH workers to suffer deficits relative to LH workers in education quality,
connections (guanxi) and other destination-specific skills, which would all appear as negative
selection on unobservables in our regressions. Thus, positive selection of out-migrants from
other provinces can only explain our main result if it outweighs these likely skill disadvantages.
A second type of selection that could account for our result is negative selection of LH
workers into formal search for private-sector jobs on XMRC. Is it possible that LH workers who
choose to look for work in Xiamen’s private sector are on average less able than the typical LH
worker? Evidence on selection into SOEs from the period before Premier Zhu’s “letting go of the
small” SOE reforms in the late 1990s actually suggests the opposite: at that time the nascent
private sector attracted workers who were more ambitious and risk tolerant (He et al., 2015).
Since those reforms, however, SOE jobs have become much scarcer, and pay well relative to
urban private sector jobs (Du and Wang, 2013). Thus it is possible that the subset of Xiamen’s
LH workers who are looking for private sector work on XMRC during our sample period are
negatively selected (in the same way that U.S.-born workers who apply to low-wage jobs
occupied mostly by temporary migrants may also be negatively selected). If so, that could
account for the NLH callback advantage in our data.
5.4

Productivity Gaps—Hours and Effort

The other potential source of migrant-native productivity gaps is different choices made
by workers of the same ability. Here, the most likely candidates are effort and labor supply
decisions that make migrants more desirable to employers. 33 One commonly-cited reason for
33

In general, firms will prefer workers who choose higher effort levels, or who will accept additional work hours,
whenever employment contracts are incomplete, i.e. as long as the pay rate per hour or piece gives workers less than
100% of the surplus they generate at the margin.

19
such oft-cited “immigrants work harder” effects is an efficiency wage effect: to the extent that
migrants’ outside options are poorer than natives’, migrants should be willing to exert more
effort to keep their jobs. Two of our key results in this paper, however, are inconsistent with this
idea. One is the fact that the current wages listed by NLH workers on their resumes are higher
than those of natives who applied to the same ad, especially in jobs with low skill requirements
(where the NLH hiring advantage is concentrated). The other is the paper’s main result: NLH
workers searching for work on XMRC have higher recall rates than urban natives, so they should
have an easier time finding alternative employment. These caveats noted, however, there may be
some outside options not visible in our data that are better for LH workers than migrants. Such
options include better access to the urban social safety net (documented in Appendix Table 1),
higher nonlabor income (including apartment rentals), and preferred access to attractive, secure
public sector and SOE jobs. It is possible that these outside options reduce natives’ work
incentives, thereby making them less attractive to private sector employers.
The second reason why effort and hours choices might differ between natives and
migrants is intertemporal labor supply substitution: to the extent that NLH workers come from,
and expect to return to a lower-wage region of origin, NLH workers have an incentive to
reallocate work hours and effort from other stages of their lifetime into the time they are in the
destination city (Dustmann 2000). If employers prefer workers with such higher attachment to
work, the intertemporal labor substitution hypothesis predicts that employers should prefer NLH
workers from poor provinces to NLH workers from rich provinces (since workers from poor
provinces have lower wages at other points in their life cycle). Note that this prediction contrasts
with what we might expect from simple human capital models, which suggest that the lower
quality of education, poorer health, and lower familiarity with modern work practices in poorer
regions would hurt those residents’ employment prospects in Xiamen.
To explore this prediction, Figure 1 plots the unadjusted NLH advantage in our data
against the mean GDP per capita in an NLH applicant’s province of hukou. It shows very high
callback rates for applicants from China’s two poorest provinces –Guizhou and Yunnan--, low
callback rates from richer areas like Guangdong and Inner Mongolia, and very few applicants to
jobs in Xiamen from the richest areas: Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. The linear regression line
in the Figure shows a clear negative relationship between per-capita GDP in the sending region
and workers’ callback rates from employers in Xiamen. To quantify this relationship, Table 6
adds four regressors to the specification in Table 2. The first is a fixed effect for whether the
NLH applicant is not from Fujian (the province in which Xiamen is located); this allows us to
see whether interprovincial applicants, as a group, are treated differently from intraprovincial
ones. The next two variables interact interprovincial migrant status with the railroad distance of
the applicant’s home province from Fujian and its level of per capita income. Among other
things, distance might affect the chances an applicant would accept the job offer if he applied
while living in the hukou province. Finally, we add a control for the migrant’s current wage (i.e.
the dependent variable in Table 5) to isolate the effect of coming from a poor region (as distinct
from having different labor market alternatives in the destination city).

20
Consistent with an intertemporal labor supply interpretation of the NLH advantage, row 3
of Table 6 shows that the NLH callback advantage decreases with the origin province’s per
capita GDP, reflecting the pattern in Figure 1. While not statistically significant in every
specification, this effect is significant (at 5 percent) in the absence of controls (column 1) and (at
10 percent) in our most saturated specifications (columns 6 and 7), which control for job cell and
job ad fixed effects respectively. While hardly definitive, we see Table 6’s results as supportive
of the intertemporal labor supply hypothesis. 34
5.5

Why is the NLH Callback Advantage Absent at Higher Skill Levels?

So far we have argued that payroll tax and expected productivity differences are the most
likely causes of the NLH callback advantage in our data. Neither of these hypotheses on their
own, however, can account for the fact that the NLH callback advantage is only observed in the
less-skilled jobs posted on XMRC: the tax hypothesis predicts either a constant or increasing
NLH callback advantage with skill, and so far we have not provided any reasons why NLH
workers’ productivity advantage might be confined to less skilled workers. In this final
subsection we discuss a number of factors that might attenuate NLH workers’ tax and
productivity advantages at high skill levels relative to lower skill levels.
In our review of China’s hukou system, we noted that some Chinese cities make it easier
for skilled workers than unskilled workers to acquire a local hukou. If this type of hukou
conversion is sufficiently quick and common among skilled NLH workers, it could eliminate the
tax and efficiency wage advantages of hiring them, compared to skilled LH workers. Data from
the 2005 Census, however, suggests that hukou conversion rates within the first five years of
residence in a new location are very low, even for college graduates: 87 percent of young, urban
college graduates who lived in a different location five years before the Census date did not have
their hukou in their current city. 35 Thus it seems unlikely that hukou conversion can explain why
the NLH callback gap is absent at high skill levels.
Another possibility is income effects of the much more generous education, health and
retirement benefits available to LH than NLH workers. Since these income effects are likely to
be more important for unskilled workers, they could disproportionately reduce LH workers’
hours and effort levels at low skill levels, making them less attractive to employers than
unskilled migrants who are not entitled to these benefits. The intertemporal labor substitution
effects discussed in Section 5.4 will be also stronger for unskilled migrants than skilled migrants
if, as seems likely, their wages in Xiamen differ more from their home-province wages than do
the wages of skilled migrants. Finally, and perhaps most likely, there may be production
complementarities between skill and local experience. If knowing that a worker comes from and
will remain in the city is more important to employers of skilled than unskilled workers, this will
favor skilled LH workers in the competition for callbacks. Put another way, employers of skilled
34

Consistent with the notion that employers must match applicants’ current wages, Table 6 also shows that ceteris
paribus, workers with high current wages are less likely to receive employer callbacks.

workers may care more about long term relationships and location-specific skills, and be less
interested in the cost savings or higher short-term effort levels associated with hiring temporary
migrants.

Discussion

To our knowledge this is the first paper to study employers’ hiring choices between
equally-qualified workers with and without permanent residence permits in the region of
employment. Our main finding is that despite other evidence of taste-based discrimination
against persons without permanent status (NLH) in China’s cities, and despite the fact that NLH
workers likely have lower levels of destination-specific skills than natives, employers in our data
are more likely to call back identically-matched NLH than LH applicants to the same job.
Further, this preference for migrant workers is confined to situations where firms are seeking to
fill less-skilled and lower-paid positions.
What might account for migrant workers’ estimated callback advantage in our data?
Since the advantage is confined to less skilled positions, we argue that employers’ payroll tax
savings on NLH workers (which are either skill neutral or favor skilled NLH workers) cannot be
the only explanation, suggesting that temporary migrant workers may have a productivity
advantage over natives in less skilled and low paid jobs. Possible sources of such an advantage
include differential selection of LH and NLH workers into active search for low-skilled private
sector urban jobs, and different effort and labor supply decisions while in the destination city.
For example, preferred access to secure, well paid SOE and public sector jobs and greater
coverage by the urban social safety net could reduce less-skilled LH workers’ work incentives in
a way that makes them less attractive to private sector employers. At the same time,
intertemporal labor substitution effects might account for high observed levels of hours and
effort among temporary migrants, making them more attractive to employers. These and other
sources of a migrant productivity advantage will be muted in jobs with higher skill requirements
if, as seems plausible, skill is complementary with LH workers’ local labor market experience,
connections and knowledge. We stress that the above are only possible sources of a migrant
productivity advantage in low paid jobs, and that much additional work is needed to understand
the source and robustness of such an advantage.
While we believe that our findings are thought-provoking, we also emphasize that they
should be interpreted with a number of important caveats in mind. One is the fact that –as in all
correspondence studies-- our dependent variable measures callbacks only, not whether a worker
ultimately receives a job offer. As a result, our main result could be in jeopardy if firms
systematically make fewer offers per callback to NLH than LH workers, provided they do this
more at low skill levels than high ones. While we cannot rule this out, it is hard to think of
plausible reasons why callback and offer patterns might differ in this way. 36

36

A key source of the difficulty is that most unobserved factors that could affect callback rates should theoretically
affect offer rates conditional on callbacks in the same direction. For example, suppose (as seems likely) that NLH
workers’ productivity is harder to predict than natives. In that case, their higher option value suggests that employers
should not only interview more of them, but make more job offers to them as well (Lazear 1995). The same should

22
Second, recall that our data are for private-sector jobs exclusively; thus our results say
nothing about the preferences of public-sector employers and state-owned enterprises, which
according to the 2005 Census account for a majority of the jobs held by LH workers in China’s
major cities. 37 Indeed, since public sector and SOE jobs are sometimes explicitly reserved for LH
workers, our results are consistent with a segmented labor market scenario in which –holding
match quality fixed-- private-sector employers tend to prefer NLH workers, while public service
and SOE employers give preference to LH workers. Indeed, the latter sectors, which are
generally not exposed to significant competitive pressures in product markets, may play an
important role in sheltering native workers from competition with the massive influx of migrants
in many Chinese cities. 38
Finally, we emphasize that the unique nature of China’s hukou system clearly limits the
relevance of our results to workers with insecure or limited residency rights in other
jurisdictions. For example, unlike unskilled temporary migrants in the U.S. (many of whom are
undocumented), NLH workers are not at risk of summary deportation. And unlike H-1B
visaholders who are subject to U.S. Social Security and Medicare taxation (Thibodeau, 2010),
skilled NLH workers pay different payroll taxes than their native counterparts. Still, in the
Chinese context, our results suggest quite strongly (and perhaps paradoxically) that --at least at
low skill levels—learning that a worker has limited residency rights in a city appears to make
that city’s employers more interested in hiring that worker.

apply if NLH workers are more likely to accept a job offer than LH applicants: both callbacks and offers should be
higher, with no clear prediction for the ratio of offers to callbacks.
37

See Appendix Table 1: the share is 62 percent.

House (2012) documents a similar, though more extreme phenomenon in Saudi Arabia, where 90 percent of
private-sector jobs are held by foreigners, while natives either work in the public sector or not at all.

Notes: Education matching based on five ordered categories in the ad and resume: primary (6 years), junior middle (9 years), technical or
high school (11-12 years), college (15 years), and university (16 years). Age matching variables refer to whether the applicant’s age is below,
within, or above the requested age range. Experience matching variables refer to whether the applicant’s experience is below, 0-2 years
above, or more than 3 years above the requested experience level. In addition to the covariates shown, columns 2-7 include the following:
the job’s requested education level (5 categories), requested experience level (quadratic), requested age level (quadratic in midpoint of
range), requested gender (male, female, not specified), advertised wage (quadratic in midpoint of bin; 8 bins). Also included are dummies for
and whether the worker is female, whether a new graduate is requested, for whether the worker is a new graduate, for whether the worker’s
new graduate status matches the employer’s request. We also control for whether technical school is specifically requested, whether the
worker attended technical school, and the match between these. Indicators for missing age and wage information for either the ad or the
worker are also included, where relevant. Columns 3-7 add controls for the following worker (CV) characteristics (these characteristics are
not mentioned in job ads very often): the applicant’s Zhicheng rank (6 categories), whether the CV is in English, the number of schools
attended, number of job experience spells, number of certifications reported, applicant height (interacted with applicant gender), an
indicator for myopia (interacted with applicant gender), and marital status (interacted with applicant gender). Standard errors in parentheses
are clustered by ad. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: Data are from the 2005 Census of China, 1% sample, persons aged 15-65, healthy, current living in urban regions, excluding students.

All rural hukou individuals are regarded as without local hukou in the urban area. Major cities are the four municipalities directly under the
jurisdiction of the central government (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjing and Chongqing) plus the 15 subprovincial cities: Changchun, Chendgu,
Dalian, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Harbin, Jinan, Nanjing, Ningbo, Qingdao, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Xiamen, and Xi’an. Column 1 (LH)
shows characteristics of all working-age persons who have a permanent residence permit in their current city of residence. Column (2) (NLH)
is for the remainder of urban residents, whose hukou registration is elsewhere; most but not all of these persons are rural-urban migrants
from poorer parts of China. Columns 3 and 4 replicate columns 1 and 2 for the city of Xiamen only. Here “Public” employer type refers to SOEs,
government and collectives, where collectives play a minimal role in urban areas; “Private” employer type refers to for-profit firms, self-employed and
other.

Notes: * is the approximate mean wage in XMRC analysis sample. 98 percent of offered and current wages in our data are between 1000
and 5000 RMB/month. Tax basis: For retirement insurance, tax rates are applied to the worker’s actual salary for LH workers, but to a fixed
amount of 900RMB per month for NLH workers. For medical insurance, tax rates are applied to the worker’s actual salary (with a minimum
of 1823 RMB/month) for LH workers, but to a fixed amount of 1823 RMB/month for NLH workers. Both tax bases for LH workers are capped
at three times the city average salary: 9114 RMB/month. Tax rates: For retirement insurance, LH workers and their employers pay 8% and
14% of the basis respectively. NLH workers and their employers each contribute 8 percent of their basis respectively. For medical insurance,
LH workers and their employers contribute 2% and 7% of the basis respectively. NLH workers and their employers each contribute 2% of the
basis.
