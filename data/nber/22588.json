    "abstract": "\n\nIn a Honduran field experiment, sequences of cash transfers to poor households varied in amount of the largest (\u201cpeak\u201d) and last (\u201cend\u201d) transfers. Larger peak-end transfers increased voter turnout and the incumbent party\u2019s vote share in the 2013 presidential election, independently of cumulative transfers. A plausible explanation is that voters succumbed to a common cognitive bias by applying peak-end heuristics. Another is that voters deliberately used peak-end transfers to update beliefs about the incumbent party. In either case, the results provide experimental evidence on the classic non-experimental finding that voters are especially sensitive to recent economic activity.\n\n",
