    "abstract": "\n\nThe Second World War II (WWII) was arguably one of the largest shocks to the U.S. economic and production system in history. Historians, business historians, and economists have largely discussed the stimulus that WWII had on U.S. technological advancements. However, its effect on U.S. \u2018\u2018managerial technology\u2019\u2019 innovations has been largely ignored, except for very few qualitative works. In this paper, I argue that \u2018\u2018managerial technology\u2019\u2019 played a key role in shaping U.S. WWII production and its capacity to defeat some of the most advanced economies in the world. The large-scale diffusion of innovative management practices to US firms involved in war production acted as a technology that put them on a higher growth path for decades. Moreover, it made U.S. managerial practices internationally distinctive and helped create the so-called \u201cAmerican Way\u201d of business, which was exported to war-torn European and Japanese economies in the war aftermath.\n\n",
