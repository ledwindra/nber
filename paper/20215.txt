Averting Catastrophes: The Strange Economics of Scylla and Charybdis

NBER Working Paper No. 20215
June 2014
JEL No. D81,H56,Q54
ABSTRACT
How should we evaluate public policies or projects to avert, or reduce the likelihood of, a catastrophic
event? Examples might include inspection and surveillance programs to avert nuclear terrorism, investments
in vaccine technologies to help respond to a "mega-virus," or the construction of levees to avert major
flooding. A policy to avert a particular catastrophe considered in isolation might be evaluated in a
cost-benefit framework. But because society faces multiple potential catastrophes, simple cost-benefit
analysis breaks down: Even if the benefit of averting each one exceeds the cost, we should not necessarily
avert all of them. We explore the policy interdependence of catastrophic events, and show that considering
these events in isolation can lead to policies that are far from optimal. We develop a rule for determining
which events should be averted and which should not.

“ ‘Is there no way,’ said I, ‘of escaping Charybdis, and at the same time keeping
Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?’
“ ‘You dare-devil,’ replied the goddess, ‘you are always wanting to fight somebody
or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even by the immortals.’ ”
Homer, Odyssey, Book XII, trans. Samuel Butler.

Like any good sailor, Odysseus sought to avoid every potential catastrophe that might
harm him and his crew. But, as the goddess Circe made clear, although he could avoid the
six-headed sea monster Scylla or the “sucking whirlpool” of Charybdis, he could not avoid
both. Circe explained that the greatest expected loss would come from an encounter with
Charybdis, which should therefore be avoided, even at the cost of an encounter with Scylla.
We modern mortals likewise face myriad potential catastrophes, some more daunting
than those faced by Odysseus. Nuclear or bio-terrorism, an uncontrolled viral epidemic,
or a climate change catastrophe are examples. Naturally, we would like to avoid all such
catastrophes. But is that goal feasible, or even advisable? Should we instead avoid some
catastrophes and accept the inevitability of others? And if so, which ones should we avoid?
Unlike Odysseus, we cannot turn to the gods for advice. We must turn instead to economics,
the truly dismal science.
Those readers hoping that economics will provide simple advice, such as “avert a catastrophe if the benefits of doing so exceed the cost,” will be disappointed. We will see that
deciding which catastrophes to avert is a much more difficult problem than it might first
appear, and a simple cost-benefit rule doesn’t work. Suppose, for example, that society
faces five major potential catastrophes. If the benefit of averting each one exceeds the cost,
straightforward cost-benefit analysis would suggest that we should avert all five.1 We show,
however, that it may well be the case that we should avert only (say) three of the five. That
is why we call the economics of Scylla and Charybdis “strange.”
Our results highlight a fundamental flaw in the way economists usually approach potential
catastrophes. Consider the possibility of a climate change catastrophe — a climate outcome
so severe in terms of higher temperatures and rising sea levels that it would sharply reduce
economic output and consumption (broadly understood). A number of studies have tried
to evaluate greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement policies by combining GHG abatement cost
1

Although we will often talk of ‘averting’ or ‘eliminating’ catastrophes, our framework allows for the
possibility that catastrophes can only partially be alleviated (if at all), as we show in Section 4.1.

estimates with estimates of the expected benefits to society (in terms of reduced future
damages) from avoiding or reducing the likelihood of a bad outcome.2 To our knowledge,
however, all such studies look at climate change in isolation. We show that this is misleading.
A climate catastrophe is only one of a number of potential catastrophes that might occur
and cause major damage on a global scale. Other catastrophic events may be as likely or more
likely to occur, could occur much sooner, and could have an even worse impact on economic
output and even mortality. Examples include nuclear terrorism, an all-out nuclear exchange,
a mega-virus on the scale of the Spanish flu of 1918, or bioterrorism.3 One could of course
estimate the benefits to society from averting each of these other potential catastrophes, once
again taking each in isolation, and then given estimates of the cost of averting the event,
come up with a policy recommendation. But as we will show, applying cost-benefit analysis
to each event in isolation can lead to a policy that is far from optimal.
Conventional cost-benefit analysis can be applied directly to “marginal” projects, i.e.,
projects whose costs and benefits have no significant impact on the overall economy. But
policies or projects to avert major catastrophes are not marginal; their costs and benefits can
alter society’s aggregate consumption, and that is why they cannot be studied in isolation.
Like many other studies, we measure benefits in terms of “willingness to pay” (WTP), i.e.,
the maximum fraction of consumption society would be willing to sacrifice, now and for ever,
to achieve an objective. We can then address the following two questions: First, how will the
WTP for averting Catastrophe A (let’s say a climate catastrophe) change once we take into
account that other potential catastrophes B, C, D, etc., lurk in the background? We show
that the WTP to eliminate A will go up.4 The reason is that the other potential catastrophes
reduce expected future consumption, thereby increasing expected future marginal utility
before a climate catastrophe occurs. This in turn increases the benefit of avoiding the
climate catastrophe. Likewise, each individual WTP (e.g., to avert just B) will be higher
the greater is the “background risk” from the other catastrophes. What about the WTP to
avert all of the potential catastrophes? It will be less than the sum of the individual WTPs.
2

Most of these studies develop “integrated assessment models” (IAMs) and use them for policy evaluation.
The literature is vast, but Nordhaus (2008) and Stern (2007) are widely cited examples; other examples
include the many studies that attempt to estimate the social cost of carbon (SCC). For a survey of SCC
estimates based on three widely used IAMs, see Greenstone, Kopits and Wolverton (2013) and Interagency
Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon (2010). Most of these studies, however, focus on “most likely”
climate outcomes, not low-probability catastrophic outcomes. See Pindyck (2013a,b) for a critique and
discussion. One of the earliest treatments of environmental catastrophes is Cropper (1976).
3

Readers with limited imaginations should read Posner (2004), who provides more examples of potential
catastrophes and argues that society fails to take these risks seriously enough, and Sunstein (2007).
4

As we will see, this result requires the coefficient of relative risk aversion to exceed one.

2

The WTPs are not additive; society would probably be unwilling to spend 60 or 80% of
GDP (and could not spend 110% of GDP) to avert all of these catastrophes.
WTP relates to the demand side of policy: it is society’s reservation price—the most it
would sacrifice—to achieve some goal. In our case, it is a measure of the benefit of averting a
particular catastrophe. It does not tell us whether averting the catastrophe makes economic
sense. For that we also need to know the cost. There are various way to characterize such
a cost, e.g., a fixed dollar amount, a time-varying stream of expenditures, etc. In order to
make comparisons with the WTP measure of benefits, we express cost as a permanent tax
on consumption at rate τ , the revenues from which would be just enough to pay for whatever
is required to avert the catastrophe.
Now suppose we know, for each major type of catastrophe, the corresponding costs and
benefits. More precisely, imagine that we are given (perhaps by some government agency) a
list (τ1 , w1 ), (τ2 , w2 ), . . . , (τN , wN ) of costs (τi ) and WTPs (wi ) associated with projects to
eliminate N different potential catastrophes. That brings us to our second question: Which
of the N “projects” should we choose to implement? If wi > τi for all i, should we eliminate
all N potential catastrophes? Not necessarily. We show how to decide which projects to
choose to maximize social welfare.
When the projects are very small relative to the economy, and if there are not too many of
them, the conventional cost-benefit intuition prevails: since no project is mutually exclusive,
we should implement any project whose benefit wi exceeds its cost τi . This intuition would
apply, for example, for the construction of a dam to avert flooding in some area. Conventional
cost-benefit analysis applies to marginal projects, i.e., ones that are small relative to the
overall economy and thus have a negligible impact on total consumption.
Things are much more interesting when projects are large relative to the economy, as
might be the case for the global catastrophes mentioned above, or if they are small but
large in number (so that their influence in aggregate is large). “Large” projects change total
consumption and marginal utility, and as a result the usual intuition breaks down: There
is an essential interdependence among the projects that must be taken into account when
formulating policy. We show how to do so. We also explore several examples to illustrate
some of the more counterintuitive results that arise when determining which catastrophes
should and which should not be averted.
For instance, we consider an example in which there are three potential catastrophes.
The first has a benefit w1 much greater than the cost τ1 , and the other two have benefits
greater than the costs, but not that much greater. Naive reasoning would suggest that we
should eliminate the first catastrophe and then decide whether to eliminate the other two,
3

but we show that such reasoning is wrong. If only one of the three were to be eliminated, we
should indeed choose the first; and we would do even better by eliminating all three. But
we would do best of all by eliminating the second and third and not the first: the presence
of the second and third catastrophes makes it suboptimal to eliminate the first. (On the
other hand, if the catastrophes were smaller—if all costs and benefits were divided by some
sufficiently large number—then we should eliminate all three.)
To see why some form of interdependence is inevitable, imagine that there are many
types of independent catastrophes that could in principle be averted, and that the costs
and benefits of doing so are the same for each type. Conventional cost-benefit analysis
would direct us either to avert all or none, depending on whether benefits exceed costs. But
averting all catastrophes would reduce consumption almost to zero. We show that, indeed,
the optimal policy in this stylized example is to avert some subset of the catastrophes.
In the next section we explain our basic framework of analysis by focusing on the WTP
to avert a single type of catastrophe (e.g., nuclear terrorism), taken in isolation and ignoring
other types of catastrophes. The model is simple: we use a constant relative risk aversion
(CRRA) utility function to measure the welfare accruing from a consumption stream, we
assume that the catastrophe arrives as a Poisson event with known mean arrival time, it can
occur repeatedly (we also treat the single-occurrence case, but in an appendix), and on each
occurrence it reduces consumption by a random fraction. Although it might appear that
this “single-type” model is an extension of the existing literature on generic “consumption
disasters,” it is in fact quite different.5 We examine a particular type of catastrophe and find
the WTP to eliminate it completely or reduce the likelihood of it occurring by some amount.
Most importantly, our framework allows us to treat a discrete set of catastrophes, each with
its own characteristics, show how the WTPs are related to each other, and determine the
optimal set that should be averted.
In Sections 2 and 3 we allow for multiple types of catastrophes. Each type has its own
mean arrival rate and its own impact distribution. We find the WTP to eliminate a single
type of catastrophe and show how it depends on the existence of other types, and we also find
the WTP to eliminate several of the types at once. Our first observation is that the presence
of multiple catastrophes may make it less desirable to try to mitigate some catastrophes for
5

Examples of that literature include Backus, Chernov and Martin (2011), Barro and Jin (2011), Martin
(2008) and Pindyck and Wang (2013). Some of these papers use more general Epstein–Weil–Zin recursive
preferences to measure welfare, which we avoid to keep things as simple as possible. Martin (2008) estimates
the welfare cost of consumption uncertainty to be about 14%, most of which is attributable to higher
cumulants (disaster risk) in the consumption process. Barro (2013) examines the WTP to avoid a climate
change catastrophe with (unavoidable) generic catastrophes in the background.

4

which action would appear desirable, considered in isolation. Next, given information on
the cost of eliminating (or reducing the likelihood of) each type of catastrophe, we examine
the set of potential projects, and show how to find the welfare-maximizing combination of
projects that should be undertaken.
Section 4 discusses several extensions of our model. First, we show that our framework
allows for the partial alleviation of catastrophes, i.e., for policies that reduce the likelihood
of catastrophes occurring rather than eliminating them completely. The paper’s central intuitions apply even if the policy choice is a continuous variable (i.e., even if we can adjust
the arrival rate of each catastrophe on a continuous spectrum). Second, we show that our
framework easily handles catastrophes that are directly related to one another: for example, averting nuclear terrorism might also help avert bioterrorism. Third, we show that our
framework can handle bonanzas as well as catastrophes, that is, projects such as blue-sky
research that increase the probability of events that raise consumption (as opposed to decreasing the probability of events that lower consumption). Finally, we discuss catastrophes
that cause the death of some fraction of the population instead of a drop in consumption.
The contribution of this paper is largely theoretical: we provide a framework for analyzing
different types of catastrophes and deciding which ones should be included as a target of
government policy. Determining the actual likelihood of nuclear terrorism or a mega-virus,
as well as the cost of reducing the likelihood, is no easy matter. Nonetheless, we want to
show how our framework might be applied to real-world government policy formulation. To
that end, we survey the (very limited) literature for seven potential catastrophes, discuss how
one could come up with the relevant numbers, and then use our framework to determine
which of these catastrophes should or should not be averted.

1

WTP to Avoid One Type of Catastrophe

We first consider a single type of catastrophe. It might be a climate change catastrophe, a
mega-virus, or something else. What matters is that we assume for now that this particular
type of catastrophe is the only thing society is concerned about. We want to determine
society’s WTP to eliminate the possibility that this type of catastrophe will occur. By WTP
we mean the maximum fraction of consumption, now and throughout the future, that society
would sacrifice to avoid this type of catastrophe. Of course WTP could have other forms,
e.g., the maximum percentage of consumption society would give up starting at a specific
future time, or the maximum percentage of consumption over some limited time horizon.
Defining WTP as we do here is relatively simple, and consistent with most other studies.
5

It is important to stress that this WTP is a reservation price, i.e., the most society
would sacrifice. It might be the case that the revenue stream corresponding to this WTP
(and presumably collected by the government) is insufficient to eliminate the risk of the
catastrophe occurring, in which case eliminating the risk is economically infeasible. Or, the
cost of eliminating the risk might be lower than the corresponding revenue stream, in which
case the “project” would have a positive net social surplus. The WTP applies only to the
demand side of government policy. Later, when we examine multiple types of catastrophes,
we will also consider the supply (i.e., cost) side.
To calculate a WTP, we must consider whether the type of catastrophe at issue can occur
once and only once (if it occurs at all), or can occur repeatedly. For a climate catastrophe, it
might be reasonable to assume that it would occur only once—the global mean temperature,
for example, might rise much more than expected, leading to large increases in sea levels,
and causing economic damage far greater than anticipated, and perhaps becoming worse and
worse over time as the temperature keeps rising.6 But for most potential catastrophes, such
as a mega-virus, nuclear terrorism, or nuclear war, it is more reasonable to assume that the
catastrophe could occur multiple times. Throughout the paper we will assume that multiple
occurrences are indeed possible. However, in Appendix A we examine the WTP to eliminate
a particular type of catastrophe that can occur only once.
We will assume that without any catastrophe, real per-capital consumption will grow
at a constant rate g, and we normalize so that at time t = 0, C0 = 1. Let ct denote log
consumption. We define a catastrophe as an event that permanently reduces consumption
by a random fraction φ, so that if the catastrophic event first occurs at time t1 , Ct = egt for
t < t1 and then falls to Ct = e−φ+gt at t = t1 . For now we impose no restrictions on the
probability distribution for φ. We use a simple CRRA utility function to measure welfare,
and denote the index of relative risk aversion by η and rate of time preference by δ. We will
generally assume that η > 1, so utility is negative. The analysis is the same if η < 1, except
that utility will be positive. Later we treat the special case of η = 1, i.e., log utility.
We assume throughout this paper that the catastrophic event of interest occurs as a
Poisson arrival with mean arrival rate λ, and that the impact of the nth arrival, φn , is i.i.d.
across realizations n. Thus the process for consumption is:
ct = log Ct = gt −

N (t)

n=1

That is why some argue that the best way to avert a climate catastrophe is to invest now in geoengineering
technologies that could be used to reverse the temperature increases. See, e.g., Barrett (2008, 2009), Kousky
et al. (2009), and MacCracken (2009).

where N (t) is a Poisson counting process with mean arrival rate λ, so that when the nth
catastrophic event occurs, consumption is instantly multiplied by the random variable e−φn .
To simplify the analysis, we follow Martin (2013) by introducing the cumulant-generating
function (CGF),
κt (θ) ≡ log E ect θ ≡ log E Ctθ .
As we will see, the CGF summarizes the effects of various types of risk in a very simple
way. In our case, since the process for consumption given in (1) is a Lévy process, we can
simplify κt (θ) = κ(θ)t, where κ(θ) means κ1 (θ). In other words, the t-period CGF scales
the 1-period CGF linearly in t. We show in the appendix that the CGF is then7

κ(θ) = gθ + λ E e−θφ1 − 1 .

where κ(1 − η) is the CGF of equation (2) with θ = 1 − η. Note that equation (3) is quite
general and applies to any distribution for the impact φ. But note also that welfare is finite
only if the integrals converge, and for this we need δ − κ(1 − η) > 0 (Martin (2013)).
Eliminating the catastrophe is equivalent to setting λ = 0 in equation (2). We denote
the CGF in this case by κ(1) (θ). (This notation will prove convenient later when we allow
for several types of catastrophes.) With λ = 0 the CGF is simply
κ(1) (θ) = gθ.

We could allow for ct = gt − n=1 φn , where gt is any Lévy process, subject to the condition that ensures
finiteness of expected utility. (For the special case in (1), gt = gt for a constant g.) This only requires that
the term gθ in the CGFs is replaced by g(θ), where g(θ) is the CGF of g1 , so if there are Brownian shocks

with volatility σ, jumps with arrival rate ω and stochastic impact J, g(θ) = µθ + 21 σ 2 θ2 + ω E eθJ − 1 .
This lets us handle Brownian shocks and unavoidable catastrophes without modifying the framework. Since
the generalization has no effect on any of our qualitative results, we stick to the simpler formulation.

This representation is quite general, and will be useful below. In particular, we do not need
to assume that the consumption process is deterministic in the absence of the catastrophe.
Should society avoid this catastrophe? This is easy to answer because with only one type
of catastrophe to worry about, we can apply standard cost-benefit analysis. The benefit is
w, and the cost is the permanent tax on consumption, τ , needed to generate the revenue
to eliminate the risk. We should avoid the catastrophe as long as w > τ . As we will see
shortly, when there are multiple potential catastrophes the benefits from eliminating each
are interdependent, causing this simple logic to break down.
The CGF of (2) applies to any distribution for the impact φ. However, we will sometimes
assume for purposes of numerical examples that z = e−φ is distributed according to a power
distribution with parameter β > 0,
b(z) = βz β−1 ,

0 ≤ z ≤ 1.

(6)

In this case, E(e−φθ ) = β/(β + θ). A large value of β implies a large E z and thus a small
expected impact of the event.8 Given this distribution for z, the CGF is simply
κ(θ) = gθ −

λθ
.
β+θ

(7)

In this special case, the CGF tends to infinity as θ → −β from above. For the condition that
δ − κ(1 − η) > 0 to have any chance of holding, we must therefore assume that β > η − 1:
catastrophes cannot be too fat-tailed.
What is the WTP to avert the catastrophe? Given the power distribution for z = e−φ ,
after substituting (7) and (4) for κ(1 − η) and κ(1) (1 − η), the WTP is


where ρ ≡ δ + g(η − 1). We will have w < 1 as long as the parameters are such that expected
utility, with or without catastrophes, is finite. This means that we need
ρ−

λ(η − 1)
> 0.
β−η+1

If this does not hold, expected utility (with catastrophes) is unbounded as t grows. This
constraint can actually be quite restrictive. If η = 2, g = δ = .02, and β = 3 (so that
8

A power distribution of this sort has often been used in modeling (albeit smaller) catastrophic events
such as floods and hurricanes; see, e.g., Woo (1999). Barro and Jin (2011) show that the distribution provides
a good fit to panel data on the sizes of major consumption contractions. Note E(z) = β/(β + 1), and the
variance of z around its mean is var(z) = β/[(β + 2)(β + 1)2 ].

E z = .75 and E φ = .25), we need λ < .08, i.e., the event cannot on average occur more than
every 12 years. But if β = 1.5 (so that E z = .60 and E φ = .40), we need λ < .02, i.e., the
event cannot on average occur more than every 50 years. Alternatively, if λ = .04, we need
β > 2, i.e., an event that occurs on average every 25 years cannot reduce consumption by
more than a third. And if δ = 0 (a rate of time preference that some have argued is “ethical”
for intergenerational comparisons), we would need β > 3 so E z > .75. These restrictions on
λ and/or β are reasonable for most of the catastrophic events that we might think about
(environmental catastrophes, nuclear or bio-terrorism, major earthquakes). However, once
we allow for more than one type of event, the restrictions become more severe.

Two Types of Catastrophes

In the previous section we have shown how to calculate the WTP to avert a single type
of catastrophe, ignoring the existence of other potential catastrophes. We now extend the
analysis to multiple types of catastrophes, show how to find the WTP to avert each type,
and then examine the interrelationship among the WTPs. We can then address the question
of how to choose which catastrophes should be averted.
In this section, we consider only two types of catastrophes. This will allow us to illustrate
some (but not all) of the key points, and is relatively simple. For simplicity, we assume that
a catastrophic event causes destruction (i.e., a drop in consumption) but not death. We also
assume that these events occur independently of each other. So log consumption is

Interrelationship of WTPs

How is the WTP to avert Catastrophe 1 affected by the existence of Catastrophe 2? We can
think of Catastrophe 2 as a kind of “background risk” that has two effects: It (a) reduces
expected future consumption, while increasing the variance of future consumption; and (b)
thereby raises future expected marginal utility. Remember that each catastrophic event
reduces consumption by some percentage φ. The first effect therefore reduces the WTP
because there is less (future) consumption available, so that the event causes a smaller drop
in consumption. The second effect raises the WTP because the loss of utility is greater
when total consumption has been reduced. If η > 1 so that expected marginal utility
rises sufficiently when consumption falls, the second effect dominates, and the existence of
Catastrophe 2 will on net increase the benefit of averting Catastrophe 1, and raise its WTP.
This can be seen from equation (9). The CGF κ(1 − η) summarizes the effects of both
sources of risk; compared to a world in which Catastrophe 2 did not exist, it will be larger,
making w1 larger. Consider our power law example, in which zi = e−φi follows a power
distribution with parameter βi , so that

Figure 1: Effects of background risk: The figures fix δ = .02, g = .02, β1 = β2 = 6, λ1 = .02,
and plot w1 (solid), w2 (dashed), and w1,2 (dotted) for a range of values of λ2 .
where as before, ρ ≡ δ+g(η−1). Note from this equation that as long as η > 1, ∂w1 /∂λ2 > 0.
What happens if η < 1? In that case, ∂w1 /∂λ2 < 0, because then the effect of reduced future
consumption from Catastrophe 2 exceeds the effect of increased marginal utility.9
This is illustrated in Figure 1, which fixes δ = .02, g = .02, β1 = β2 = 6, λ1 = .02, and
plots w1 (solid), w2 (dashed), and w12 (dotted) for a range of values of λ2 , and for two different
values of risk aversion, η. When λ2 = .02, Catastrophes 1 and 2 have identical attributes, so
the WTP to avert Catastrophe 1 (solid line) equals the WTP to avert Catastrophe 2 (dashed
line). As shown in Figure 1b, when η > 1 the WTP to avert Catastrophe 1 increases as the
arrival rate of Catastrophe 2 increases.10 The opposite holds when η < 1, as in Figure 1a.

The pure consumption effect is easiest to see with a simple two-period example. Suppose η = 0, so welfare
is the sum of consumption today and a future time T . Ignore discounting. Assume Catastrophe 1 will occur
at time T and will reduce CT by a known fraction φ1 = .60. Without the catastrophe, C0 = CT . What is the
WTP to eliminate this catastrophe? Welfare if we do nothing is V0 = C0 + .4C0 = 1.4C0 . Thus the WTP to
eliminate the catastrophe is w1 = .30. Now introduce Catastrophe 2, which will not be prevented, and will
also occur at time T and reduces consumption by φ2 = .50. Now what is the WTP to eliminate catastrophe 1?
If we do nothing, welfare is V0 = C0 + (1 − φ1 )(1 − φ2 )C0 = 1.2C0 . If we sacrifice a fraction w of consumption
to eliminate Catastrophe 1, welfare is V1 = (1−w)C0 +(1−w)(1−φ2 )C0 = (1−w)C0 +(1−w)(.5C0 ). Setting
V0 = V1 gives w1 = .20. The WTP has decreased from .30 to .20. The reason w1 falls is that Catastrophe
2 reduces the damage caused by Catastrophe 1 — Catastrophe 1 will cause a loss of 60% of .5C0 , not 60%
of C0 . Total expected consumption is lower with Catastrophe 2 present, reducing the benefit of eliminating
any other catastrophe. With η = 0, changes in marginal utility don’t enter.
10

This result is related to the notion of “risk vulnerability” introduced by Gollier and Pratt (1996). They
derive conditions under which adding a zero-mean background risk to wealth will cause an agent to act
more risk-averse towards an additional risky prospect (e.g., will lower the agent’s optimal investment in any
other independent risk). The conditions are that the utility function exhibits absolute risk aversion that is
both declining and convex in wealth, a natural assumption that holds for all HARA utility functions. Risk
vulnerability includes the concept by Kimball (1993) of “standard risk aversion” as a special case. Note that

11

We will see below that when η = 1 (log utility), WTPs to avert different catastrophes are
independent of other background risks.
Unless noted otherwise, in the rest of this paper we will assume that η > 1. This is
consistent with both the finance and macroeconomics literatures, which put η in the range
of 2 to 5 (or even higher).
The next step is to link w1,2 to the individual WTPs w1 and w2 . The key to doing so is
to note that since κ(1) (θ) + κ(2) (θ) = κ(θ) + κ(1,2) (θ), we have
1 + (1 − w1,2 )1−η = (1 − w1 )1−η + (1 − w2 )1−η .

(11)

Thus we can express the WTP to eliminate both types of catastrophes, w1,2 in terms of w1
and w2 . But note that these WTPs do not add. In fact we can now show that w1,2 < w1 +w2 .
Clearly this must be the case if w1 + w2 > 1, so assume that w1 + w2 ≤ 1. Equation (11)
implies that w1,2 < w1 + w2 if 1 + (1 − w1 − w2 )1−η > (1 − w1 )1−η + (1 − w2 )1−η . But this
holds by convexity of the function x1−η , which gives the result.

2.2

Which Catastrophes to Avert?

Suppose we know the cost of averting each of these two catastrophes, expressed as a permanent consumption tax at rate τi . We can now ask which, if any, of the two catastrophes
should society avert? If τi > wi , then we should not avert catastrophe i. To make this
interesting, we will assume that τi < wi for both i = 1 and 2. Thus it is clearly optimal to
avert at least one of the catastrophes, but is it optimal to avert both?
To address this question, it will be useful to express the costs and benefits τi and wi in
terms of changes in utility rather than percentages of consumption. To do so, define
Ki = (1 − τi )1−η − 1
Bi = (1 − wi )1−η − 1 .

(12)

After appropriately normalizing the utility function, Ki has a simple interpretation as the
percentage loss of utility that results when consumption is reduced by the fraction τi , and
likewise for Bi ; correspondingly, Ki /(η − 1) is the absolute change in utility, measured in
utils, when C is reduced by τi , and likewise for Bi /(η − 1). Note that Ki and Bi are positive
and increasing in τi and wi , respectively; and that Ki > Bi if and only if τi > wi .
These utility-based measures of costs and benefits have some useful characteristics. We
saw, for example, that WTPs do not add: if η > 1, then w1,2 < w1 + w2 . Corresponding
in our model background risk is not zero-mean; background events always reduce consumption.

12

to equation (12), define B1,2 = (1 − w1,2 )1−η − 1. Then, from equation (11) we see that
B1,2 = B1 + B2 , i.e., the Bi s do add. What about costs? The consumption tax needed to
avert both catastrophes is τ1,2 = 1−(1−τ1 )(1−τ2 ). The corresponding utility-based measure
is K1,2 = (1 − τ1,2 )1−η − 1 = (1 − τ1 )1−η (1 − τ2 )1−η − 1. Thus 1 + K1,2 = (1 + K1 )(1 + K2 ),
i.e., the costs multiply. These properties of the Bi s and Ki s—that benefits add and costs
multiply—will prove useful later when we generalize to N different catastrophes.
Given these measures of costs and benefits, we now turn to the question of which catastrophes should be averted. Suppose B1 is sufficiently greater than K1 that we will definitely
avert Catastrophe 1. Should we also avert Catastrophe 2? Only if the benefit-cost ratio
B2 /K2 exceeds the following hurdle rate:
B2
> 1 + B1 .
K2

(13)

Thus the fact that society is going to avert Catastrophe 1 increases the hurdle rate for
Catastrophe 2. Furthermore, the greater is the benefit B1 , the greater is the increase in the
hurdle rate for Catastrophe 2. Notice that this logic also applies if B1 = B2 and K1 = K2 ;
thus it might be the case that only one of two identical catastrophes should be averted.
If this result seems counter-intuitive, remember that what matters for this decision is
the additional benefit from averting Catastrophe 2 relative to the cost. In WTP terms, i.e.,
measured as a percentage of consumption, that additional benefit is (w1,2 − w1 )/(1 − w1 ).
Substituting in the definitions of Ki and Bi , we can see that equation (13) is equivalent to
w1,2 − w1
> τ2 .
1 − w1
It can easily be the case that w2 > τ2 but (w1,2 − w1 )/(1 − w1 ) < τ2 . The reason is that these
are not marginal projects, and as a result, w1,2 < w1 + w2 . This is what raises the hurdle
rate in equation (13). To avert Catastrophe 1, society is willing to give up the fraction w1
of consumption, so that the remaining consumption is lower and marginal utility is higher.
Thus the dollar loss (as opposed to the percentage loss) from Catastrophe 2 is reduced, and
the utility loss from the second tax τ2 is increased.
Example 1: Two Catastrophes. To illustrate this result, suppose τ1 = 20% and τ2 = 10%.
Figure 2 shows which catastrophes should be averted for a range of different values of w1
and w2 . When wi < τi for both catastrophes (in the bottom left rectangle), neither should
be averted. We should avert both catastrophes only for combinations (w1 , w2 ) in the middle
lozenge-shaped region. That region shrinks considerably when we increase η. In the context
of equation (13), the larger is η the larger is B1 , and thus the larger is the hurdle rate for
averting the second catastrophe.

Figure 2: There are two potential catastrophes, with τ1 = 20% and τ2 = 10%. The figures
show, for all possible values of w1 and w2 , which catastrophes should be averted (in curly
brackets). A catastrophe for which wi < τi should not be averted. We should avert both
catastrophes only for combinations (w1 , w2 ) in the middle shaded region. That region shrinks
considerably when risk aversion, η, increases.
Consider, for example, the point (w1 , w2 ) = (60%, 20%) in panel (b) of Figure 2. As
shown, we should avert only the first catastrophe even though w2 > τ2 . In this case B1 =
5.25, B2 = 0.56, and K2 = 0.23, so B2 /K2 = 2.39 < 1 + B1 = 6.25. Equivalently, w1,2 =
61.7%, so (w1,2 −w1 )/(1−w1 ) = 4.3% < τ2 = 10%. The additional benefit from also averting
Catastrophe 2 is less than the cost.

2.3

Marginal vs. “Non-Marginal” Projects

We have seen that the WTP to avert one catastrophe is affected by the presence of a second
catastrophe, even if that second catastrophe is not averted. Likewise, equation (13) shows
that averting one catastrophe increases the hurdle rate B/K that must be met to avert a
second catastrophe. As explained above, the reason is that the impact of each catastrophe
is “non-marginal,” as is the cost of a project to avert it. It is easy to see that these effects
disappear when the catastrophes (and the costs of averting them) are marginal, i.e., tiny in
relation to the overall economy.
For example, consider eqn. (10), which applies when zi = e−φi follows a power distribution, and the derivative ∂w1 /∂λ2 . The impact of a catastrophe is “tiny” when the parameter
β is very large. (A very large β implies a large E e−φ and thus a small expected impact.)
14

One can see from equation (10) that ∂w1 /∂λ2 → 0 as β becomes very large.
Likewise, equation (13) says that the hurdle rate for averting Catastrophe 2 is B2 /K2 =
1 + B1 = (1 − w1 )1−η . But if the impact of Catastrophe 1 is tiny, so that w1 is very small,
(1 − w1 )1−η ≈ 1, and the usual cost-benefit criterion applies.

3

N Types of Catastrophes

We aim to answer the following question: Given a list (τ1 , w1 ), . . . , (τN , wN ) of costs and
benefits of eliminating different types of catastrophes, which ones should we eliminate? The
punch line will be given by (18) below: There is a fundamental sense in which benefits add but
costs multiply. This will imply that there is potentially a substantial penalty associated with
implementing several projects. As a result, it will often be optimal not to avert catastrophes
whose elimination looks like a good idea in naive cost-benefit terms. Also, in Section 4.1 we
will show that our analysis applies unchanged to the case in which catastrophes are alleviated
by reducing their arrival rate only partially (as opposed to all the way to zero).
If there are N types of catastrophes, the CGF is
κ(θ) = gθ +

N
X


λi E e−θφi − 1 .

(14)

Following the same steps as above, the WTP to eliminate some arbitrary subset S of the
catastrophes, which we will write as wS , and the WTP to eliminate an individual catastrophe
i (which we continue to write as wi ) are given by
(1 − wS )1−η =

δ − κ(S) (1 − η)
δ − κ(1 − η)

and (1 − wi )1−η =

δ − κ(i) (1 − η)
,
δ − κ(1 − η)

(15)

respectively. (The superscripts on the CGF indicate which subset of catastrophes has had
its λi s set to zero.) The next result shows how wS , the WTP for eliminating the subset of
catastrophes, can be connected to the WTPs for each of the individual catastrophes in the
subset.
Result 1. The WTP to avert a subset, S, of the catastrophes is linked to the WTPs to avert
each individual catastrophe in the subset by the expression
(1 − wS )1−η − 1 =

that κ(i) (θ) = κ(θ) − λi E e−θφi − 1 and κ(S) (θ) = κ(θ) − i∈S λi E e−θφi − 1 . (This is

δ − κ(1 − η)

Using (15), we have the result.
For the case of N = 2, we showed that w1,2 ≤ w1 + w2 (with strict inequality if η > 1).
P
By the same reasoning, it can be shown that w1,2,...,N ≤ N
i=1 wi . Likewise, if we divide

the N catastrophes into two groups, 1 through M and M + 1 through N , then w1,2,...,N ≤
w1,2,...,M + wM +1,...,N . The WTP to eliminate all N catastrophes will be less than the sum
of the WTPs for each of the individual catastrophes, and will be less than the sum of the
WTPs to eliminate any two groups of catastrophes.

3.1

Which Catastrophes to Avert?

The WTP, wi , measures the benefit of eliminating catastrophe i as the maximum fraction of
consumption society would sacrifice to achieve this result. We measure the cost of eliminating
the catastrophe as the actual fraction of consumption that would have to be sacrificed, via
a permanent consumption tax τi , to generate the revenue needed to avert the catastrophe.
Thus, if we eliminate some subset S of the catastrophes, welfare (net of taxes) is

(17)

where the equality follows from (15). Our goal is to pick the set of catastrophes to be
eliminated to maximize this expression.
The next result shows how to formulate an optimal policy given the costs τi and benefits
wi associated with different types of catastrophes. As for the case of N = 2, define
Ki = (1 − τi )1−η − 1 and Bi = (1 − wi )1−η − 1.
As before, Ki is the percentage loss of utility that results when consumption is reduced by
τi percent, and likewise for Bi ; and dividing Ki (or Bi ) by η − 1 gives the absolute loss (or
16

gain) in utils. These utility-based definitions of costs and benefits are positive and increasing
in τi and wi , respectively, and Ki > Bi if and only if τi > wi . For small τi , we have the
linearization Ki ≈ (η − 1)τi ; and for small wi , we have Bi ≈ (η − 1)wi .
Why work with these utility-based measures of costs and benefits rather than the wi ’s
and τi ’s we started with? These measures have the nice property that the Bi ’s across
catastrophes are additive (by Result 1), and the Ki ’s are multiplicative. That is, the benefit
from eliminating, say, three catastrophes is B1,2,3 = B1 + B2 + B3 , and the cost is K1,2,3 =
(1 + K1 )(1 + K2 )(1 + K3 ) − 1. This allows us to state our main result in a simple form.

(19)

i∈S

This linearized problem is separable, which vastly simplifies its solution: a catastrophe should
be eliminated if and only if the benefit of doing so, Bi , exceeds the cost, Ki . But the
linearized problem is only a tolerable approximation to the true problem if the total number
P
of catastrophes is limited, and in particular, if i∈S Bi is small. It is not enough for the Bi s

to be individually small. The reason is that averting a large number of small catastrophes
has the same aggregate impact on consumption (and marginal utility) as does averting a few
large catastrophes. We illustrate this with the following example.
Example 2: Many Small Catastrophes. Suppose we have a large number of identical

(but independent) small potential catastrophes, each with Bi = B and Ki = K. The naive
intuition is to eliminate all if B > K, and none if B ≤ K. As Result 3 below shows, the
naive intuition is correct in the latter case; but if B > K we will not want to eliminate all
of the catastrophes. Instead, we must pick the number of catastrophes averted, m, to solve
the problem
max
m

1 + mB

(1 + K)m

(20)

In reality, m must be an integer, but we will ignore this constraint for simplicity. The optimal
choice, m∗ , is then determined by the first order condition associated with (20),
B
(1 + m∗ B) log(1 + K)
−
= 0.
∗
∗
(1 + K)m
(1 + K)m
Solving this equation for m∗ , we find that m∗ = 1/ log(1 + K) − 1/B.
For small K and B, this is approximately m∗ = (1/K)−(1/B). Thus if w = .020, τ = .015
and η = 2, B ≈ .020, K ≈ .015, and m∗ = 17. But if η = 3, m∗ = 9. And if η = 4,
B ≈ .062, K ≈ .031, and m∗ = 6. A larger value of η implies a smaller number m∗ , because
18

the percentage drop in aggregate consumption, 1 − (1 − τ )m , results in a larger increase in
marginal utility, and thus a greater loss of utility from averting one additional catastrophe.
Does it matter how large is the “large number” of catastrophes in this example (assuming
it is larger than the number we will avert)? No, because we fixed the value of w and τ
(and hence B and K) for each catastrophe. However, if we go back a step and consider
what determines w, it could indeed matter. The catastrophes we do not avert represent
“background risk,” and we have seen that all else equal, more background risk makes w
larger (assuming η > 1). Thus we would expect w (and hence B) to be larger if we face 200
small catastrophes than if we face only 50.
3.1.2

Catastrophes of Arbitrary Size

With catastrophes of arbitrary size, the solution of problem (18) is much more complicated.
How does one find the set S in practice? As a general matter, one can search over every
possible subset of the catastrophes to find the subset that maximizes the objective function in
(18). It is this (highly unusual) feature of the problem that led us to say, in the introduction,
that there is an essential interdependence between catastrophes. With N catastrophes under
consideration there are 2N possible subsets to evaluate—a problem that rapidly becomes
computationally hard. There is a stark contrast with conventional cost-benefit analysis, in
which an individual project can be evaluated in isolation. Our general problem (18) reduces
to this case only if all disasters are very small, both individually and in aggregate, as in (19).
The next result shows that we can eliminate certain projects from consideration, before
checking all subsets of the remaining projects.
Result 3 (Do no harm). A project with wi ≤ τi should never be implemented.
Proof. Let i be a project with wi ≤ τi ; then by definition, Bi ≤ Ki . Let S be any set of
projects that does not include i. Since

and since S was arbitrary, it is never optimal to avert catastrophe i.

In the other direction—deciding which projects should be implemented—things are much
less straightforward. However, we can say the following:
Result 4.

(i) If there is a catastrophe i whose wi exceeds its τi then we will want to

eliminate some catastrophe, though not necessarily i itself.
19

(ii) If it is optimal to avert catastrophe i, and catastrophe j has higher benefits and lower
costs, wj > wi and τj < τi , then it is also optimal to avert j.
(iii) If there is a project with wi > τi that has both highest benefit wi and lowest cost τi ,
then it should be averted.
(iv) Fix {(τi , wi )}i=1,...,N and assume that wi > τi for at least one catastrophe. For sufficiently high risk aversion, it is optimal to avert exactly one catastrophe: the one that
maximizes (1−τi )/(1−wi ), or equivalently (1+Bi )/(1+Ki ). If more than one disaster
maximizes this quantity, then any one of the maximizers should be chosen.
Proof. See appendix.
Beyond Result 4, it is surprisingly hard to formulate general rules for choosing which
projects should be undertaken to maximize (18). In the log utility case, though, as so often,
things are simpler.
Result 5 (The naive rule works with log utility). With log utility, the problem is separable: a
catastrophe i should be averted if and only if the benefit of doing so exceeds the cost, wi > τi .
Proof. See appendix.
Note that this result comes from our assumption that both impacts and costs are multiplicative: The total percentage reduction in consumption from two events with individual
impacts φ1 and φ2 is 1 − (1 − φ1 )(1 − φ2 ), and likewise if we avert both, consumption falls
by 1 − (1 − τ1 )(1 − τ2 ). Taking logs, the individual impacts are additive, and cancel out if
the corresponding catastrophes are not averted.11
To get a feeling for the possibilities when η > 1, and how counter-intuitive they can be,
we now consider some simple examples that illustrate how not all projects with Bi > Ki
should be undertaken.
For instance, one apparently plausible approach to the problem of project selection is to
act sequentially: pick the project that would be implemented if only one catastrophe were to
11

This is easy to see with a two-period example. Ignore discounting, and assume catastrophe i will
occur at time T and reduce CT by a known fraction φi , i = 1, 2. With just catastrophe 1, if we do
nothing, V0 = log C0 + log[(1 − φ1 )C0 ] = 2 log C0 + log(1 − φ1 ). If we eliminate catastrophe 1, V1 =
2 log[(1 − w)C0 ] = 2 log(1 − w) + 2 log C0 , so 2 log(1 − w) = log(1 − φ1 ). With catastrophe 2 present,
V0 = log C0 + log[(1 − φ1 )(1 − φ2 )C0 ] = 2 log C0 + log(1 − φ1 ) + log(1 − φ2 ). If we eliminate catastrophe 1,
V1 = log[(1 − w)C0 ] + log[(1 − w)(1 − φ2 )C0 ] = 2 log(1 − w) + 2 log C0 + log(1 − φ2 ), so setting V0 = V1 , the
log(1 − φ2 ) terms cancel out, and 2 log(1 − w) = log(1 − φ1 ) as before.

20

be eliminated and then—after implementing that project—continue, selecting the next most
desirable project; and so on. The next example shows that this approach is not optimal.
Example 3: Sequential Choice Is Not Optimal. Suppose that there are three catastrophes
with (K1 , B1 ) = (0.5, 1) and (K2 , B2 ) = (K3 , B3 ) = (0.25, 0.6).12 If only one were to be
eliminated, we should choose the first (so that in eqn. (18), V = 1.33); and we would do
even better by eliminating all three (so that V = 1.37). But we would do best of all by
eliminating the second and third catastrophes and not the first (so that V = 1.41).
The next example develops this point further, showing, again with three types of catastrophes, how the choice of which to avert can vary considerably with the cost and benefit
parameters and with risk aversion.
Example 4: Choosing Among Three Catastrophes. We now extend Example 1 by adding
a third catastrophe. Specifically, suppose that there are three potential catastrophes with
τ1 = 20%, τ2 = 10%, and τ3 = 5%. Figure 3 shows, for various different values of w3 and η,
which potential catastrophes should be averted as w1 and w2 vary between 0 and 1. (Figure 3
is analogous to Figure 2, except that now there is a third potential catastrophe.)
When η is close to 1, as in Figure 3a, the usual intuition applies: catastrophe 3 should
always be averted (since w3 > τ3 ), and catastrophes 1 and 2 should be averted if wi > τi .
Figure 3b shows that this usual intuition breaks down when η is 2: for instance, it is never
optimal to avert all three catastrophes. In Figure 3c, we increase w3 to 20%, and the choice of
catastrophes to avert becomes complicated. Consider what happens as we move horizontally
across the figure, keeping w2 fixed at 50%. For w1 < 30%, we should avert catastrophes 2
and 3 but not catastrophe 1, even when w1 > τ1 = 20%. The reason is that the additional
benefit from including catastrophe 1, (w1,2,3 − w2,3 )/(1 − w2,3 ), is less than the cost, τ1 .
If w1 > 30%, the additional benefit exceeds the cost, and we should avert catastrophe 1.
But once w1 exceeds 70%, we should no longer avert catastrophe 3. Taken by itself, the
benefit from averting catastrophe 3 exceeds the cost, but as we have seen, “taken by itself”
does not lead to the best outcome. When w1 is greater than 70% (but less than 90%), we
should avert catastrophes 1 and 2, but the additional benefit of also averting catastrophe
3, i.e., (w1,2,3 − w1,2 )/(1 − w1,2 ), is less than the cost, τ3 . Finally, when we increase η to 3,
in Figure 3d, the range of values of w1 and w2 for which all three catastrophes should be
averted becomes much smaller.
We now turn to an example that shows that the presence of many small potential catas12

trophes raises the hurdle rate required to act to prevent a large potential catastrophe. In
particular, it may be best not to eliminate the large catastrophe, even if the benefit of
elimination exceeds the cost.
Example 5: Multiple Small Catastrophes Can Crowd Out a Large Catastrophe. Suppose
that there are many small, independent, catastrophes, each with cost k and benefit b, and
one large catastrophe with cost K and benefit B. Then we must compare

with

max

Ignoring the integer constraint, and assuming that it is optimal to eliminate at least one
small catastrophe, the optimized values of these problems are
b(1 + k)1/b
e log(1 + k)

and

b(1 + k)(1+B)/b
,
e(1 + K) log(1 + k)

respectively. It follows that we should eliminate the large catastrophe if and only if
B

log(1 + K)

(21)

If the costs of eliminating all catastrophes are small enough that we can use the approximation log(1 + x) ≈ x, then the criterion is essentially that we should avert the large
catastrophe if and only if B/K > b/k. For small B, K, b, and k, this is equivalent to
W/T > w/τ (where for example W denotes WTP to eliminate the large catastrophe and τ
the cost of eliminating the small catastrophe). Thus the hurdle rate for elimination of the
large catastrophe is increased by virtue of the presence of the small catastrophes.
Figure 4 shows this graphically. In this example, η = 4 and the small catastrophes,
indicated on each figure by a small solid circle, have wi = 1% and τi = 0.5% (on the left)
or wi = 1% and τi = 0.25% (on the right). These minor catastrophes cast a shadow over
the optimal policy regarding the major catastrophe: if the latter lies in the shaded region
determined by (21), it should not be averted. In contrast, absent the minor catastrophes,
the major catastrophe should be averted if it lies anywhere above the dashed 45◦ line.
Example 6: Choosing Among Eight Catastrophes. Figures 5 and 6 show the results of
some numerical experiments. Each panel of Figure 5 plots randomly chosen (from a uniform
distribution on [0, 50%]) WTPs and costs, wi and τi , for a set of eight catastrophes. Fixing
these wi s and τi s, we calculate Bi and Ki for a range of different values of η. We can then pick
the set, S, of catastrophes that should be eliminated to maximize (18). These catastrophes
are indicated by blue dots in each panel; catastrophes that should not be eliminated are

indicated by red crosses. The 45◦ line is shown in each panel; points below it have wi < τi
and hence Bi < Ki . As shown in Result 3, these catastrophes should never be averted.
Points above the line have wi > τi : these are catastrophes for which WTP is higher than the
cost of averting. Even so, the figures show that it is often not optimal to avert.
In Figure 5 the catastrophes are relatively severe; the λi s and βi s are such that the wi s
often exceed 30 or 40%. Figure 5a shows that when risk aversion η is close to 1, each of the
catastrophes above the 45◦ line should be eliminated, so the optimal policy is very close to the
naive rule, consistent with Result 5. As η increases above 1.2, the optimal project selection
rapidly diverges from the simple rule and depends, in a complicated way, on the level of risk
aversion. When η = 5, it is optimal to avert just one ‘doomsday’ catastrophe. When η = 4,
it is optimal to avert two different catastrophes. When η = 3, three catastrophes should be
averted—but still not the doomsday catastrophe. As η declines further, it again becomes
optimal to avert the doomsday catastrophe.
Figure 6 shows what happens when the catastrophes are much less severe. We use the
same constellation of WTPs and costs, but scaled down in size by a factor of 10. The naive
rule of picking any project whose benefit exceeds its cost applies for a wider range of η, as
shown in Panel 6a, and the optimal rule diverges more slowly than in Figure 5. Note finally,
in Figure 6f, that for sufficiently large η just one catastrophe will be averted, as before; but
it is a different catastrophe than in Figure 5f.

Extensions

Thus far, we have made various assumptions to keep things simple. We have taken an ‘allor-nothing’ approach to alleviating catastrophes: a catastrophe is averted entirely or not at
all. We have assumed that a policy to avert catastrophe A has no effect on the likelihood of
catastrophe B. And we have assumed that catastrophes are, well, catastrophes, that is, bad
news. This section shows that all three assumptions are inessential. We can allow for partial,
as opposed to total, alleviation of catastrophes; we can allow for the possibility that a policy
to avert (say) nuclear terrorism decreases the likelihood of bio-terrorism; and we can use
the framework to consider optimal policies with respect to potential bonanzas—policies such
as blue-sky research or infrastructure investment that increase the probability of something
good happening (as opposed to decreasing the probability of something bad happening).

4.1

Partial Alleviation of Catastrophes

As a practical matter, the complete elimination of some catastrophes may be impossible or
prohibitively expensive. A more feasible alternative may be to reduce the likelihood that the
catastrophe will occur, i.e., to reduce the Poisson arrival rate λ. For example, Allison (2004)
suggests that the annual probability of a nuclear terrorist attack is λ ≈ .07. While reducing
the probability to zero may not be possible, we might be able to reduce λ substantially at a
cost that is less than the benefit. Should we do that, and how would the answer change if
we are also considering reducing the arrival rates for other potential catastrophes?
Our analysis of multiple catastrophes makes this problem easy to deal with. We consider
the possibility of reducing the arrival rate of some catastrophe from λ to λ(1 − p), which we
call “alleviating the catastrophe by probability p.” We write w1 (p) for the WTP to do just
that for the first type of catastrophe. Thus w1 , in our earlier notation, is equal to w1 (1).
We consider two forms of partial alleviation. First, suppose there are specific policies that
alleviate a given catastrophe type by some probability; an example is the rigorous inspection
of shipping containers. This implies a discrete set of policies to consider, and the previous
analysis goes through essentially unmodified. Second, we allow the probability by which the
catastrophe is alleviated to be chosen optimally. Perhaps surprisingly, the discrete flavor of
our earlier results still hold, and those results are almost unchanged.
4.1.1

Discrete partial alleviation

To find the WTP to alleviate the first type of catastrophe by probability p, that is, w1 (p), we
make use of a property of Poisson processes. We can split the ‘type-1’ catastrophe into two
27

subsidiary types: 1a (arriving at rate λ1a ≡ λ1 p) and 1b (arriving at rate λ1b ≡ λ1 (1 − p)).13
Thus we can rewrite the CGF (14) in the equivalent form:
−θφ1

κ(θ) = gθ +

type 1a, arriving at rate λ1a

}

so that alleviating catastrophe 1 by probability p corresponds to setting λ1a to zero, and
alleviating catastrophe 1 by probability 1 − p corresponds to setting λ1b to zero. This fits
the partial alleviation problem into our framework. For example, Result 1 implies that
1 + (1 − w1 (1))1−η = (1 − w1 (p))1−η + (1 − w1 (1 − p))1−η
and the argument below equation (11) implies that w1 (p)+w1 (1−p) > w1 (1) for all p ∈ (0, 1).

For example, w1 12 > 12 w1 (1): the WTP to reduce the likelihood of the catastrophe by half
is more than half the WTP to eliminate it entirely.
More generally, we can split up each type of catastrophe into two or more subtypes.
Suppose, for example, that catastrophe #2 can be alleviated by 20% at some cost, and by
30% at some other cost, but it cannot be averted fully. We can then split this into three
subtypes: type 2a catastrophes, arriving at rate 0.2 × λ2 , which can be averted at cost
τ2a < 1; type 2b catastrophes, arriving at rate 0.3 × λ2 , which can be averted at cost τ2b < 1;
and type 2c catastrophes, arriving at rate 0.5 × λ2 , which can be averted at cost τ2c = 1, i.e.,
at infinite utility cost.
The next result links the WTP to alleviate a catastrophe by some probability to the
WTP to avert fully.
Result 6. The WTP to avert catastrophe i by probability p ∈ [0, 1] is given in terms of
wi = wi (1) by the formula



wi (p) = 1 − 1 + p (1 − wi )1−η − 1

1−η

.

In terms of Bi (p)—defined, analogous to (12), by Bi (p) = [1 − wi (p)]1−η − 1—we have
Bi (p) = pBi .
13

The mathematical fact in the background is that if we start with a single Poisson process with arrival
rate λ, and independently color each arrival red with probability p and blue otherwise, the red and blue
processes are each Poisson processes, with arrival rates λp and λ(1 − p) respectively.

28

Proof. As shown above, we can split the original catastrophe (arriving at rate λ) into N
different catastrophes, each arriving at rate λ/N , and link the cost of eliminating each of
these individually to the cost of eliminating the overall catastrophe. From equation (16),


(22)

This establishes the result when p = 1/N , for integer N . Next we extend to rationals, M/N .


But this follows immediately because, using equation (16) again, M (1 − wi (1/N ))1−η − 1 =
(1 − wi (M/N ))1−η − 1, and so, using (22),

This establishes the result for arbitrary rational p. Finally, since WTP is a continuous
function of p, and since the rationals are dense in the reals, the result holds for all p; and it
is immediate that the formula for wi (p) is equivalent to the formula for Bi (p).
To summarize, once catastrophe types are defined appropriately, our framework accommodates without modification policies to alleviate catastrophes by some probability.
4.1.2

Optimal partial alleviation

Now we allow the probability by which a given catastrophe is alleviated to be chosen freely.
We assume that for each catastrophe i, we are given the WTP wi —which implicitly defines
wi (p), by Result 6—and the cost function, τi (p), associated with alleviating by probability p.
For now we do not specify the particular form of τi (p), but below we will consider a natural
special case in which τi (p) is determined as a function of τi ≡ τi (1) and p in much the same
way as wi (p) is determined by wi ≡ wi (1) and p.
Defining Ki (p) = (1 − τi (p))1−η − 1, the optimization problem is to

If the functions kj (·) are convex, which we now assume is the case, then this is a convex problem, so that the Kuhn–Tucker conditions are necessary and sufficient. Attaching
multipliers γj to the constraints pj − 1 ≤ 0 and µj to the constraints −pj ≤ 0, we have the
following necessary and sufficient conditions: for all j, we have γj ≥ 0 and µj ≥ 0, and
1+

− kj′ (pj ) = γj − µj

where γj (pj − 1) = 0 and µj pj = 0.

The latter two (complementary slackness) conditions imply that pj = 1 if γj > 0 and pj = 0
if µj > 0. For any fixed j, at most one of γj and µj can be positive.
To analyze the problem further, we now consider two alternative assumptions about the
shapes of the cost functions ki (p).
Alternative 1: Inada-type conditions on ki (p). Suppose that kj′ (0) = 0 and kj′ (1) = ∞.
Then we can rule out corner solutions, so all Lagrange multipliers are zero and

(23)

From the definition of ki (·), kj′ (pj ) = Kj′ (pj )/[1 + Kj (pj )], so—assuming it is optimal to avert

at least one catastrophe, so that 1 + i pi Bi > N
j=1 (1 + Kj (pj )) and hence 1 +
i pi B i >
1 + Kj (pj ) for all j—condition (23) implies that Bj > Kj′ (pj ) at any interior optimum.14
P
Compare this with the corresponding condition in the naive problem maxpj j Bj (pj ) −
P
′
j Kj (pj ), which is that Bj = Kj (pj ). Once again, the presence of multiple catastrophes
raises the hurdle rate, but now for an increase in pj , i.e., greater alleviation.
Alternative 2: A benchmark functional form for ki (p). Suppose that
(1 − τi (p))(1 − τi (q)) = 1 − τi (p + q) for all p, q, and i,
so that ‘alleviating by p’ and then ‘alleviating by q’ is as costly as ‘alleviating by p + q’ in
one go. This is a technological assumption. It might hold if a deadly virus comes from goats
or chimps, and funds can be devoted to goat research, chimp research, or both. In other
cases, it might not hold: there might be a finite cost of alleviating by 0.5 but an infinite cost
of fully averting.
14

Remember that Bj = Bj (1) is a number, not a function; since Bj (pj ) = pj Bj , from Result 6, we can
also interpret Bj as the marginal benefit of an increase in pj , that is, Bj′ (pj ).

30

This assumption pins down the form of the cost function: writing τi (1) = τi , we must
have τi (p) = 1 − (1 − τi )p or, equivalently, 1 + Ki (p) = (1 + Ki )p . This implies that the
functions ki (·) defined above are linear:
ki (pi ) = log(1 + Ki (pi )) = pi ki ,

(24)

where ki ≡ log(1 + Ki ). Thus kj′ (pj ) = kj , an exogenous constant independent of pj .
By analyzing the Kuhn–Tucker conditions, the set of catastrophes can be divided into
three groups. First, there are catastrophes j that should not be averted even partially (so
that pj = 0). For these catastrophes the cost-benefit tradeoff is unattractive, in that
X

Then there are the catastrophes that should be fully averted. These are catastrophes j that
pass a certain hurdle rate,

i
Finally, there may be interior solutions, catastrophes that are partially averted, pj ∈ [0, 1].

These must satisfy

X
Bj
pi B i .

kj
i

Catastrophes are therefore categorized by the benefit-cost ratios Bj /kj . These can be
thought of as parameters of the policy choice problem. If, by coincidence, two or more
different types of catastrophes have the same ratio Bj /kj , then we may have two or more
types of catastrophe that are partially alleviated. But generically, all catastrophes will have
different values of Bj /kj and so at most one catastrophe should be partially alleviated ; the
remainder are all-or-nothing, and should be fully averted if their benefit-cost ratio exceeds
P
the critical hurdle rate X ≡ 1 + i pi Bi , and not averted at all if their benefit-cost ratio is
less than X. The interdependence manifests itself through the fact that the hurdle rate X is
dependent on the characteristics of, and optimal policies regarding, all the catastrophes.15
This is illustrated in Figure 7, which makes the same assumptions about wi and τi as in
Figure 2; the only difference is that we now allow for optimal partial alleviation, with cost
functions ki (p) as in (24). The basic intuition is not altered by partial alleviation.
15

This characterization fails in the all-or-nothing case, as can be seen by considering an example with two
catastrophes and B1 = 8, K1 = 0.4, B2 = 36, K2 = 4. The optimal policy with partial alleviation is to avert
catastrophe 1 fully, and catastrophe 2 with probability 0.371. Correspondingly, catastrophe 2 has a lower
Bj /kj . But in the all-or-nothing case, it is best to avert catastrophe 2 and not catastrophe 1.

Figure 7: Modifying the example illustrated in Figure 2 to allow for partial alleviation
with cost functions as in (24). There are two potential catastrophes, with τ1 = 20% and
τ2 = 10%. Unnumbered zones are areas where one of the catastrophes should be partially
alleviated (and it should be obvious from the location which one).

4.2

Related catastrophes

Thus far, we have thought of policy responses to one catastrophe as having no effect on the
likelihood of another catastrophe. We might expect, however, that a policy to avert nuclear
terrorism may also help to avert bio-terrorism. As in Section 4.1.1, our framework allows for
this possibility, once catastrophe types are defined appropriately.
For example, we can bundle nuclear and bio-terrorism together into a single catastrophe
type that can be averted at some cost. When a terrorist attack occurs—that is, when there
is a Poisson arrival for this catastrophe type—it may be either a biological attack (with
probability p) or a nuclear attack (with probability 1 − p). The distribution of damages
associated with biological attacks may differ from the distribution of damages associated
with nuclear attacks; the resulting distribution for φ, the loss associated with the ‘bundled’
catastrophe, is then simply a mixture of the two distributions.
Suppose, for example, that nuclear and bio-terrorism are the only two types of catastrophe, with arrival rates λ1 and λ2 and stochastic impacts φ1 and φ2 respectively. If the two
are entirely independent, and policies to avert them are entirely independent (as we have
been implicitly assuming thus far) then the CGF, as in (8), is


κ(θ) = gθ + λ1 E e−θφ1 − 1 + λ2 E e−θφ2 − 1 .
32

(25)

Alternatively, if we believe that the same policy action will avert both nuclear and bioterrorism, we can think of there being a single catastrophe16 that arrives at rate λ ≡ λ1 + λ2 ,
and such that a fraction p ≡ λ1 /(λ1 + λ2 ) of arrivals correspond to nuclear attacks with
stochastic impact φ1 , and a fraction 1 − p = λ2 /(λ1 + λ2 ) correspond to bio-attacks with
stochastic impact φ2 . This ensures that the arrival rate of nuclear attacks is λ1 , as before,
and similarly for bio-attacks. Then we can think of the CGF as

κ(θ) = gθ + λ E e−θφ − 1 .
(26)

Equations (25) and (26) describe the same CGF, since E e−θφ = p E e−θφ1 +(1 − p) E e−θφ2 .
If policies to avert nuclear and bio-terrorism are best thought of separately (because a policy
to avert nuclear terrorism will not have any effect on bio-terrorist attacks) then it is natural
to work with (25); averting nuclear terrorism corresponds to setting λ1 = 0. If, on the other
hand, a policy to avert nuclear terrorism will also avert bio-terrorism, then it is more natural
to work with (26); averting both corresponds to setting λ = 0.
Lastly, we can combine the results of this section and Section 4.1.1 to allow a single
policy to avert multiple catastrophes partially (and potentially by different probabilities
in each case). As an example, consider a policy that alleviates catastrophe type 1 with
probability p1 and catastrophe type 2 with probability p2 . The trick, again, is to label
catastrophes appropriately by splitting types 1 and 2 into four separate types: types 1a and
1b have arrival rates λ1 p1 and λ1 (1 − p1 ) respectively, and types 2a and 2b have arrival rates

λ2 p2 and λ2 (1 − p2 ) respectively. Now view types 1a and 2a as an amalgamated Poisson
e ≡ λ1 p1 + λ2 p2 (with impact distribution equal to a mixture of
process with arrival rate λ
distributions φ1 and φ2 with weights λ1 p1 /(λ1 p1 +λ2 p2 ) and λ2 p2 /(λ1 p1 +λ2 p2 ), respectively).
e to zero, and the previous results go through unchanged.
The policy option then is to set λ

Bonanzas

Our framework also applies to projects that may lead to good outcomes. For simplicity,
suppose that log consumption is ct = gt in the absence of any action. There are also projects
j = 1, . . . , m that can be implemented. If project j is implemented, log consumption is
PNj (t)
augmented by the process i=1
φj,i ; if they are all implemented, log consumption follows

As in footnote 13, if we have a ‘red’ Poisson process with arrival rate λ1 and a ‘blue’ Poisson process
with arrival rate λ2 , we can define a ‘color-blind’ stochastic process that does not distinguish between blue
and red arrivals. This stochastic process is also a Poisson process, with arrival rate λ1 + λ2 .

previous sections, we define κ(θ) = gθ to be the CGF of log consumption growth if no

growth if project j is implemented, and κ(S) (θ) = gθ + j∈S λj E eθφj,1 − 1 to be the CGF

of log consumption growth if projects j ∈ S are implemented.
If no projects are implemented, expected utility is 1/(1 − η)(δ − κ(1 − η)). If projects
j ∈ S are implemented, expected utility is 1/(1 − η)(δ − κ(S) (1 − η)). The WTP for the set
S of projects, wS , therefore satisfies

This is exactly the same relationship as held with catastrophes, in the form of equation

(15). Similarly, because we have the key formula i∈S κ(i) (θ) = (|S| − 1) κ(θ) + κ(S) (θ), we

immediately have the formula (16). Results 1 and 2 therefore also hold for bonanzas, by the
same logic as before.

4.4

Death

We have assumed that if a catastrophic event occurs, it reduces consumption by a random
fraction φ (e.g., by destroying a fraction of the capital stock or reducing its productivity).
This is the standard way to model and analyze catastrophic events and their impact.17
Catastrophic events, however, can and often do kill people.
What is the WTP to avert a catastrophe that would kill some fraction φ of the population
(leaving the consumption of those who live unchanged), as opposed to destroying capital and
reducing aggregate consumption by φ? We explore this question in separate paper and show
that the WTP to avert the death of a fraction φ of the population is much greater than the
WTP to avert a drop in consumption by the same fraction. This should not be surprising;
most people would pay far more to avoid a 5% chance of dying than they would to avoid a 5%
drop in consumption. The difference in WTPs is large because a reduction in consumption
represents a marginal loss of utility, whereas death represents a total loss of utility (albeit
for only a fraction φ of the population).
17

Barro and Jin (2011) and others refer to catastrophes as “consumption disasters.” To our knowledge,
the literature on climate change, and in particular the use of IAMs to assess climate change policies, utilize
consumption-based damages, i.e., climate change reduces GDP and consumption directly (as in Nordhaus
(2008) and Stern (2007)), or reduces the growth rate of consumption (as in Pindyck (2012)). Millner (2013)
discusses welfare frameworks that incorporate death.

34

The actual difference in WTPs depends on the value of a life lost, which is often proxied
by the “value of a statistical life” (VSL). The VSL is usually defined as the marginal rate
of substitution between wealth (or consumption, or discounted consumption over a lifetime)
and the probability of survival. Thus it is a local measure, and is highly imperfect in that
we would expect an individual or society to be willing to pay much more than the VSL
to avoid certain death. Many studies have estimated the VSL using data on risk-of-death
choices made by individuals, and typically find numbers in the range of 3 to 10 times lifetime
income or consumption. In Martin and Pindyck (2014), we show that using a VSL of 6 times
lifetime consumption implies that the WTP to avoid a probability of death of φ is equal to
the WTP to avoid a drop in consumption of roughly 5φ or more. Some of the catastrophes
that we will consider in the next section involve death, and we will use such a multiple to
translate a φ for death into a welfare-equivalent φ for lost consumption.

Some Rough Numbers

This paper is largely theoretical in nature; our objective has been to show that policies
or projects to avert or reduce the likelihood of major catastrophes cannot be analyzed in
isolation, and the problem of deciding which catastrophes should be averted and which
should not is non-trivial. However, it is useful to examine some rough numbers to see how
our framework could be applied in practice. To that end, we examine some of the potential
catastrophes that we believe are important, along with some very rough estimates of the
likelihood, potential impact, and cost of averting each of them.
We assume that the impact of each event is governed by the power distribution (6) for
z = e−φ , so for each type of catastrophe βi is determined from an estimate of E zi . Using
estimates of λi and τi , we set g = δ = .02 and calculate wi , Bi , and Ki for η = 2 and
η = 4. The wi for each catastrophe is calculated taking into account the presence of the
other catastrophes. The estimates of λi , βi , and τi are summarized in Table 1 along with the
calculated values of wi , Bi , and Ki . The last row of the table shows the WTP to avert all
P
seven catastrophes (w1,...,7 < i wi ) and the corresponding benefit and cost in utility terms,
P
Q
B1,...,7 = i Bi and 1 + K1,...,7 = i (1 + Ki ). Note that for both values of η, B1,...,7 > K1,...,7 ,
but as we will see, it is not optimal to avert all seven catastrophes.
The estimates of λi , βi , and τi are explained in Appendix D. For some of the catastrophes
(floods, storms, and earthquakes), the estimates are based on a relatively large amount of
data. For others (e.g., nuclear terrorism), they are based on the subjective estimates of
several authors, and readers may disagree with some of the numbers. As a result, they

Note: For each catastrophe, table shows estimate of mean arrival rate λ, impact distribution
parameter β, and prevention cost τ , as discussed in Appendix D. The impact of each event is
assumed to follow eqn. (6); β = E z/(1 − E z), where z = e−φ is the fraction of consumption
remaining following the event (so a large β implies a small expected impact). For each value of η,
the table shows wi , the WTP to avert catastrophe i as a fraction of consumption, and the benefit
and cost in utility terms, Bi and Ki , assuming g = δ = .02. The bottom row shows the WTP to
avert all seven catastrophes, and the corresponding benefit B1,...,7 and cost K1,...,7 in utility terms.

should be viewed as speculative and largely illustrative, but they also serve to show how
difficult it is to characterize some catastrophes.
The estimates of wi , Bi , and Ki in Table 1 depend, of course, on the values of δ and
η. What are the “correct” values of these two parameters? We have chosen values roughly
consistent with the macroeconomics and finance literatures, but we view δ and η as policy
parameters, i.e., reflecting the choices of policy makers. Thus there are no single values that
we can deem “correct.”18
Which of the seven potential catastrophes summarized in Table 1 should be averted?
We can answer this using Result 2. Although B1,...,7 > K1,...,7 , it is not optimal to avert
all seven. As Figure 8 shows, the correct answer depends partly on the coefficient of risk
18

The rate of time preference δ matters because catastrophic events are expected to occur infrequently, so
long time horizons are involved. The macroeconomics and finance literatures suggest δ ≈ 2 to 5 percent, and
η is anywhere from 1.5 to at least 4. Some economists, e.g., Stern (2008), argue that on ethical grounds, δ
should be zero, i.e., it is unethical to discount the welfare of future generations. Likewise, η reflects aversion
to consumption inequality across generations, suggesting a lower value. In the end, δ and η are (implicitly)
chosen by policy makers, who might or might not believe (or care) that their policy decisions reflect the
values of voters. For a clear treatment of discounting, especially over long horizons, see Gollier (2013). For
a wide-ranging and insightful discussion of economic policy-making under uncertainty, see Manski (2013).

aversion, η. If η = 2, five of the seven catastrophes should be averted; earthquakes and a
climate catastrophe should not be averted. But if η = 4, a climate catastrophe should be
averted, but not bioterrorism, storms or earthquakes, even though the benefit of averting
each of these three catastrophes exceeds the cost.
Note from Table 1 and Figure 8 that if η = 2, the WTP to avert a climate catastrophe
is just slightly greater than the WTP to avert bioterrorism (.048 versus .047). However, if
η = 4 the WTP for climate becomes much greater than the WTP for bioterrorism (.180
versus .079). Why the sharp increase in the WTP for climate? The reason is that a climate
catastrophe has a relatively low arrival rate (λ = .004, which implies it is very unlikely to
occur in the next 20 or so years) but a large expected impact (β = 4), whereas the opposite is
true for bioterrorism (λ = .04 and β = 32). With high risk aversion, the impact on marginal
utility of a very severe (even if unlikely) climate outcome is scaled up considerably.19

Conclusions

How should economists evaluate projects or policies to avert major catastrophes? We have
shown that if society faces more than just one catastrophe (which it surely does), conventional
cost-benefit analysis breaks down; if applied to each catastrophe in isolation, it can lead to
policies that are far from optimal. The reason is that the costs and benefits of averting a
catastrophe are not “marginal,” in that they have significant impacts on total consumption.
19

In asset pricing terms, after scaling up by marginal utility, the risk-neutral probability of a bad climate
event becomes much greater than the real-world probability.

37

As a result, there is an essential interdependence among the projects that must be taken into
account when formulating policy. In fact, as we demonstrated in Example 2, cost-benefit
analysis can even fail when applied to “small” catastrophes if they are numerous and have
a non-marginal aggregate impact.
Using WTP to measure benefits and a permanent tax on consumption as measure of cost
(both a percentage of consumption), we derived a decision rule (Result 2) to determine the
optimal set of catastrophes that should be averted. And we have shown that this decision rule
can yield “strange” results. For instance, as we demonstrated in Example 3, although naive
reasoning would suggest using a sequential decision rule (e.g., avert the catastrophe with the
largest benefit/cost ratio, then decide on the one with the next-largest ratio, etc.), such a rule
is not optimal. In general, in fact, there is no simple decision rule. Instead, determining the
optimal policy requires evaluating the objective function (18) of Result 2 for every possible
combination of catastrophes. In a strong sense, then, the policy implications of different
catastrophe types are inextricably intertwined.
Given that the complete elimination of some catastrophes may be impossible or prohibitively expensive, a more realistic alternative may be to reduce the likelihood that the
catastrophe will occur, i.e., reduce the Poisson arrival rate λ. We have shown how that
alternative can easily be handled in our framework. In the previous section we examined the
costs and benefits of completely averting seven catastrophes, but we could have just as easily
considered projects to reduce the likelihood of each, and given the amounts of reduction and
corresponding costs, determined the optimal set of projects to be undertaken.
Finally, the theory we have presented is quite clear. (We hope most readers will agree.)
However, its use as a tool for government policy is less clear. This should be evident from
Section 5 (“Some Rough Numbers”). First, one must identify all of the relevant potential
catastrophes; we identified seven, but there might be others. Second, for each potential
catastrophe, one must estimate the mean arrival rate λi , and the probability distribution
for the impact φi . We used a simple one-parameter power distribution for the impact, but
estimating that parameter, βi , is not straightforward. And finally, one must estimate the
cost of averting or alleviating the catastrophe, which we expressed as a permanent tax on
consumption at the rate τi . As we explained, for some catastrophes (floods, storms and
earthquakes), a relatively large amount of data are available. But for others (nuclear and
bio-terrorism, or a mega-virus), estimates of λi , βi and τi are likely to be subjective and
perhaps best viewed as speculative. On the other hand, one can use our framework to
determine optimal policies for ranges of parameter values, and thereby determine which
parameters are particularly critical, and should be the focus of research.

 1−η

From this equation, we see that (i) w∗ is an increasing function of the mean arrival rate λ;
(ii) w∗ is an increasing function of the expected impact E(φ), and thus a decreasing function
of the distribution parameter β; and (iii) w∗ is a decreasing function of both the rate of
39

time preference δ and the growth rate g. We would expect w∗ to be higher for an event
that is expected to occur sooner and have a larger expected impact, and lower if either the
rate of time preference or the consumption growth rate is higher. The dependence on η is
ambiguous. Given the growth rate g, a higher value of η implies a lower marginal utility of
future consumption, and thus a lower WTP to avoid a drop in consumption. On the other
hand it also implies a greater sensitivity to uncertainty over future consumption.
As mentioned above, we need β > η − 1. It is easy to see that as η is increased, w∗
approaches 1 as η approaches β + 1. The reason is that the risk-adjusted remaining fraction
of consumption is E((1 − φ)1−η ) = β/(β − η + 1). In risk-adjusted terms, the possibility of
a high-φ outcome weighs heavily on expected future welfare, and thus on the WTP.
A few numbers: Suppose β = 2 so the expected loss is E φ = .33, λ = .05 so the expected
arrival time of the event is E T = 1/λ = 20 years, δ = g = .02, and η = 2. Then w∗ = 0.22.
If instead δ = 0, then w∗ = 0.26. If δ = .02 as before but we increase η to 2.5, w∗ increases
sharply, to 0.60.
It is useful to compare the WTP to avoid this “once-only” event with the WTP when
the event can occur multiple times. Recall that in the latter case the WTP is

(The subscript m is added to emphasize that the event can occur multiple times.) Whether
the event can occur only once or repeatedly: (i) w∗ is increasing in the mean arrival rate
λ; (ii) w∗ is increasing in the expected impact E(1 − φ), and thus a decreasing function of
the distribution parameter β; and (iii) w∗ is a decreasing function of both the rate of time
∗
preference δ and the growth rate g. And as expected, wm
> w∗ for all η > 1, β > η −1, λ > 0.
Some comparisons; for η = 2, g = δ = .02 so ρ = .04, λ = .02 and β = 3 (so E(1 − φ) = .75):

C. Proof of Results 4 and 5

Proof of Result 4. Property (i) follows immediately from (18) and the fact that (1 + Bi )/(1 +
Ki ) > 1, so that we do better by eliminating i than by doing nothing at all. (This does not
imply, however, that it is optimal to avert i itself—there may be even better options.)
Property (ii) follows by contradiction: if j were not included in the set of catastrophes
to be eliminated, then we could increase the objective function in (18) by replacing i with j.
Property (iii) follows because if Bi > Ki , some catastrophe should be averted, by (i).
And now by (ii), we see that catastrophe i should be averted.
To prove that (iv) holds, note first that by Result 3, it is never optimal to avert a
catastrophe with τi ≥ wi . So restrict attention to catastrophes with wi > τi . Then, by
Result 2, we seek to

the unconstrained optimum is achieved by averting only a single catastrophe that maximizes
βk /αk . This is equivalent to the conditions provided in the statement of the result.

D. Catastrophe Characteristics
Here we explain how we arrived at the numbers in Table 1. For catastrophes such as floods,
storms, and earthquakes, a relatively large amount of data were available. For others (e.g.,
nuclear terrorism), there is little or no data, so the numbers are based on the subjective
estimates of several authors. As a result, those numbers should be viewed as speculative and
largely illustrative.
Mega-Viruses: Numerous authors view major pandemics as both likely and having a
catastrophic impact, but do not estimate probabilities of occurrence. Instead, an occurrence
is simply viewed by several authors as “likely.” For a range of possibilities, see Byrne (2008)
and Kilbourne (2008). For detailed discussions of how such mega-viruses could start (and
maybe end), see, e.g., Beardsley (2006) and Enserink (2004). A mega-virus would directly
reduce GDP and consumption by reducing trade, travel, and economic activity worldwide,
but its greatest impact would be the deaths of many people. In related work (Martin and
Pindyck (2014)), we show that the WTP to avert an event that kills a random φ percent
of the population is much larger than the WTP to avert an event that reduces everyone’s
consumption by the same fraction φ.
The last major pandemic to affect developed countries was the Spanish flu of 1918–
1919, which infected roughly 20 percent of the world’s population and killed 3 to 5 percent.
Because populations today have greater mobility (including air travel), a similar virus could
spread more easily. We take the average mortality rate of the next pandemic to be 3.5
percent, which we estimate is equivalent in welfare terms to a roughly 17.5 percent drop in
consumption.20 This corresponds to a value of .825/.175 = 4.7 for β, which we round to 5.
We assume λ = .02, i.e., there is roughly a 20 percent chance of a pandemic occurring in the
next 10 years.
What would be required to avert such an event? There is nothing that can be done
to prevent new viruses from evolving and infecting humans (most likely from an animal
host). If a new virus is extremely virulent and contagious, containment involves (1) the
implementation of systems to identify and isolate infected individuals (e.g., before they
20

We use a multiple of 5, which, as discussed in Martin and Pindyck (2014), would apply if we use the
“value of a statistical life” (VSL) to represent the value of a life lost, and take the VSL to be six times
lifetime consumption. A great many studies have sought to estimate the VSL using data on risk-of-death
choices made by individuals, and typically find that the VSL is on the order of 3 to 10 times lifetime income
or lifetime consumption. See, for example, Viscusi (1993) and Cropper and Sussman (1990).

board planes or trains); and (2) the rapid production of a vaccine (which would require
yet-to-be developed technologies, and government investment in a large-scale production
facility). Both of these elements involve substantial ongoing costs, but we are not aware of
any estimates of how large those costs would be. As a best guess, we will assume that those
costs could amount to 2% or more of GDP, and set τ = .02.
Climate: A consensus estimate of the increase in global mean temperature that would
be catastrophic is about 5 to 7◦ C. A summary of 22 climate science studies surveyed by
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) puts the probability of this occurring
by the end of the century at around 5 to 10%. Preliminary drafts of the 2014 IPCC report
suggest a somewhat higher probability. Weitzman (2009, 2011) argued that the probability
distribution is fat-tailed, making the actual probability 10% or more. We will use the “pessimistic” end of the range and assume that there is a 20% chance that a catastrophe climate
outcome could occur in the next 50 or 60 years, which implies that λ = .004. What would be
the impact of a catastrophic increase in temperature? Estimates of the effective reduction
in (world) GDP from catastrophic warming range from 10% to 30%; we will take the middle
of this range, which puts φ at .20 (so that β = 4).21
What would be the cost of averting a climate catastrophe? Some have argued that this
would require limiting the atmospheric GHG concentration to 450 ppm, and estimates of
the cost of achieving this target vary widely. A starting point would be the GHG emission
reductions mandated by the Kyoto Protocol (which the U.S. never signed). Estimates of the
cost of compliance with the Protocol range from 1% to 3% of GDP.22 Using the middle of
that range (2%) and assuming that stabilizing the GHG concentration at 450 ppm would be
twice as costly as Kyoto gives a cost of τ = .04.
Nuclear Terrorism: Various studies have assessed the likelihood and impact of the
detonation of one or several nuclear weapons (with the yield of the Hiroshima bomb) in
major cities. At the high end, Allison (2004) put the probability of this occurring in the
U.S. in the subsequent ten years at about 50%, which would imply a mean arrival rate
λ = .07. Others put the probability for the subsequent ten years at around 5%, which
implies λ = .005. For a survey, see Ackerman and Potter (2008). We take an average of
these two arrival rates and round it to λ = .04.
What would be the impact? Possibly a million or more deaths in the U.S., which is
0.3% of the population. In welfare terms, this would be equivalent to a roughly 1.5% drop
in consumption. But the main impact would be a shock to the capital stock and GDP
from a reduction in trade and economic activity worldwide, as vast resources would have to
be devoted to averting further events. This could easily result in a 4% drop in GDP and

consumption, for a total (effective) drop of 5.5%. This corresponds to β = 17.
The cost of completely averting a nuclear terrorist attack would be considerable. One
element is increased surveillance and intelligence (which presumably is already taking place).
But in addition, we would need to thoroughly inspect all of the containers shipped into the
U.S. daily; currently almost none are inspected. The combined cost of these two activities
could be 3% of GDP, so we set τ = .03.
Bioterrorism: Rough (and largely subjective) estimates of the likelihood of a bioterrorist attack and the costs of reducing or eliminating the risks can be found in Nouri and Chyba
(2008) and Lederberg (1999), and references they cite. We will assume that the likelihood of
a bioterrorist attack is about the same as a nuclear attack, and set λ = .04. Bioterrorism is
unlikely to result in large numbers of deaths; instead the major impact would be a shock to
GDP from panic and a reduction in trade and economic activity worldwide. As with a nuclear attack, vast resources would have to be devoted to averting further attacks. We assume
that a bio-terrorist attack would be somewhat less disruptive than nuclear terrorist attack,
and estimate that it could result in a 3% drop in GDP and consumption. This implies that
β = .97/.03 = 32.
The cost of averting bioterrorism includes increased surveillance and intelligence (which,
as with nuclear terrorism, is presumably already taking place), but also the development
of and capacity to rapidly produce vaccines and anti-viral agents to counter whatever virus
or other organisms were released. We will assume that the cost of completely averting
bioterrorism is the same as for nuclear terrorism, so τ = .03.
Floods, Storms, and Earthquakes: We make use of the recent study by Cavallo et al.
(2013) of natural disasters and their economic impact. They utilized a data set covering 196
countries over the period 1970 to 2008, which combined World Bank data on real GDP
per capita with data on natural disasters and their impacts from the EM-DAT database.23
Cavallo et al. (2013) estimated the effects of disasters occurring in 196 countries during 1970
to 1999 on the countries’ GDP in the following years. There were 2597 disasters during
1970–2008, out of a total of 39 × 196 = 7664 country-year observations, which implies an
average annual rate of 2597/7664 = .34. Of these disasters, about half were floods, about
40% storms (including hurricanes), and about 10% earthquakes. Thus we set λ = .17, .14,
and .03 for floods, storms, and earthquakes respectively.
These disasters resulted in deaths, but the number was almost always very small relative
to the country’s population. (For example, Hurricane Katrina caused 1833 deaths, which was
less than .001% of the U.S. population.) We therefore ignore the death tolls from these events
and focus on the impact on GDP. Cavallo et al. (2013) found that only the largest disasters
(the 99th percentile in terms of deaths per million people) had a statistically significant
23

The EM-DAT database was created by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters at the
Catholic University of Louvain, and has data on the occurrence and effects of natural disasters from 1900 to
the present. The data can be accessed at http://www.cred.be/.

impact on GDP ten years following the event (reducing GDP by 28% relative to what it
would have been otherwise). But although not statistically significant, smaller disasters
(at the 75th percentile) reduced GDP by 5 to 10%. Assuming that events below the 75th
percentile had no impact, we take the average impact for all three types of disasters to be a
1% drop in consumption, which implies β = 100. Thus floods, storms and earthquakes are
relatively common catastrophes, but have relatively small impacts on average.
Storms cannot be prevented, but their impact can be reduced or completely averted.
This involves relocating coastline homes and other buildings, retrofitting homes, putting
power lines underground, etc. Similar steps would have to be taken to avert the impact of
floods. We assume the cost of completely averting each of these disasters is about 2% of
consumption. The cost of averting the impact of earthquakes should be lower — we assume
1% of consumption — because many buildings in vulnerable areas have already been built to
withstand earthquakes. Thus we set τ = .02 for storms and floods, and .01 for earthquakes.
Other Catastrophic Risks: Much less likely, but certainly catastrophic, events include
nuclear war, gamma ray bursts, an asteroid hitting the Earth, and unforeseen consequences
of nanotechnology. For an overview and very rough estimates of likelihoods and impacts,
see Bostrom and Ćirković (2008), and see Posner (2004) for a further discussion, including
policy implications. We will ignore these other risks.
