A basic set of policies, currently under consideration, is projected to raise long run costs by $30 billion dollars net of taxes, while inducing an increase of 5 percent in the number of full-time male workers between the ages of 65 and 69. Alternative policies may create very different flows of funds. Outcomes, especially in the short run, will vary widely with the timing of the application decision for benefits.\n\n",
