Introduction
Meeting days of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are marked as special

events on the calendars of many market participants. FOMC announcements often cause
strong reactions in bond and stock markets. Indeed, a large literature on announcement
effects has documented increased volatility of interest rates at all maturities, not only on
FOMC meeting days, but also around releases of key macroeconomic aggregates, most prominently nonfarm payroll employment.1 The FOMC is well aware of being closely watched by
the markets, and extracts information about the current state of the economy from the current yield curve. This yield-based information may underlie the FOMC’s policy decisions.
These observations suggests that models of the yield curve should take into account
monetary policy actions by the Fed. The extensive term-structure literature in finance,
however, builds models around a few latent state variables which are backed out from yield
data. This statistical description of yields only offers limited insights into the nature of the
shocks that drive yields. Moreover, the fit of these models for yields with maturities far
away from those included in the estimation is typically bad. This property especially applies
to the very short end of the yield curve, as most studies avoid dealing with the extreme
volatility and the large outliers at certain calendar days of short-rate data (as documented
by Hamilton (1996)).
The above observations also suggest that vector autoregressions (VARs) in macroeco1

nomics that try to disentangle exogenous policy shocks from systematic responses of the
Federal Reserve to changes in macroeconomic conditions should take into account yield
data. Financial market information, however, is usually not included in VARs (see Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2000) for a survey), presumably because the usual recursive
identification scheme does not work with monthly or quarterly data. Does the Fed not react
to current yield data or do yields not react to current policy actions? Each FOMC meeting
starts with a review of the ‘financial outlook’ - this seems to exclude the first question. And
financial markets immediately react to FOMC announcements - which seems to exclude the
second.2
This paper attempts to kill these two birds with one stone. The idea is that at high
data-sampling frequencies, information about the exact timing of policy-related events, such
as FOMC meetings and macroeconomic releases, can be used to improve bond pricing and
to identify monetary policy shocks. I therefore construct a continuous-time model of the
joint distribution of bond yields, the interest-rate target set by the Fed and macroeconomic
variables the Fed cares about. The model imposes the cross-equation restrictions implied
by the absence of arbitrage and respects the timing of policy moves at FOMC meetings
and releases of macroeconomic variables that are likely to affect future Fed policy. These
policy-related events happen at distinct points in time and are therefore captured as jumps.
Although these jumps can be irregularly spaced and depend on the state of the economy,
2

Such a recursive identification assumption is made by Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) to study the impact
of monetary policy shocks on quarterly exchange rates. Eichenbaum and Evans opt for the first of the two
possible assumptions, namely that the Fed does not react to current exchange rates.

2

the model has closed-form solutions for bond prices. This feature allows an estimation with
long-maturity yield data, which is particularly important in the context of monetary policy. 3
I estimate various versions of this model with data since 1994 on LIBOR (London Interbank
Offered Rate) and swap rates in which the target rate and macroeconomic aggregates are
observable factors, along with more traditional latent factors. The estimation is by the
method of simulated maximum likelihood (Pedersen (1995), Brandt and Santa-Clara (2001)),
extended here to the case of jumps.
There are four main estimation results. First, the model considerably improves the
performance of existing yield-curve models with three latent state variables (such as Dai
and Singleton (2000)), especially at the short end of the yield curve. Intuitively, the target
set by the Fed provides a ‘clean measure’ of the short rate and therefore offers a tractable
way to fix the short end of the yield-curve at a good position. This improvement can be
achieved with a 4-factor model that includes (i) the target rate, (ii) a spread factor that
measures deviations of the short rate from the target, (iii) a traditional stochastic volatility
factor and (iv) a policy inertia factor. The short rate reverts quickly and continually to
the target, suggesting that the spread factor captures money-market noise which does not
matter for longer term yields. The target adjusts slowly toward the Fed’s new desired target
only through jumps occurring at FOMC meeting days. The likelihood of target-rate moves
3

Unrestricted regressions of short-rate changes on changes in policy rates have small sample problems
because the Fed only moves the target infrequently. Moreover, they are haunted by reserve-maintenanceperiod effects, as most policy moves before 1994 happened on Thursdays after “settlement Wednesdays.”
After 1994, almost all policy moves were made at FOMC meetings, which are usually scheduled for either
Tuesday or Wednesday. By placing the target in a yield-curve model, data on longer yields (which are
little affected by settlement Wednesdays) provide additional information about the parameters governing
the reaction of yields to target changes.

3

at FOMC meetings depends crucially on two factors: the current target and the inertia
factor. The inertia factor, which is closely related to the 2-year yield, thus captures latent
information contained in the yield curve that the Fed takes into account when conducting
policy. Persistence in the target holds the target near its old value (interest-rate smoothing),
thereby introducing positive autocorrelation in the target-rate level. The inertia factor slowly
pulls the target toward the new desired value of the target (policy inertia). Shocks to the
policy-inertia factor increase the likelihood of a target move, not only at the next meeting,
but also at subsequent meetings. This leads to positive autocorrelation in target-rate changes.
Second, the paper documents the snake-shape of the volatility curve that can be seen
in Figure 4, the standard deviation of yield changes as a function of maturity, and links
this stylized fact to policy inertia. The cross-sectional response of yields to shocks in the
inertia factor has a hump at maturities around 2 years, as the anticipated cumulative effect
of pending target changes is largest for those maturities. The combined response to moneymarket shocks and inertia-factor shocks has a snake-shaped pattern: high for very short
maturities, rapidly decreasing until maturities of around 6 months, then increasing until
maturities of up to 2 years, and finally decreasing again. As these shocks are important for
yields, this snake-shaped pattern carries over to the volatility curve.4 Shocks to the target
rate in the post-1994 environment happen mostly at FOMC meetings and thereby introduce
a seasonality into the volatility of yields.
Third, I obtain a new policy-shock series and policy-rule estimate by assuming that the
4

The volatility hump at 2 years in the data is well known, see Litterman, Scheinkman and Weiss (1988).

Fed reacts to information known right before the FOMC meeting. This makes sense, because
monetary policy is the most important, if not only, source of shocks to macroeconomic and
yield variables right at the time of the FOMC announcement. This assumption identifies
a high-frequency policy rule which is given by the expected value of the target rate at the
FOMC announcement conditional on information before the meeting. While this information
includes macroeconomic variables and yields of different maturities, the estimated rule shows
that yields are more important for the Fed. As a description of target dynamics, the rule
performs better than several benchmarks, including estimated versions of the Taylor rule
(Taylor (1993)). This improvement in fit is not a simple consequence of adding explanatory
variables to the rule, because of the cross-equation restrictions on the parameters. The extent
of the improvement is due to the fact that the yield curve, especially information contained in
yields with maturity around two years, reflects changes in the state of economy that the Fed
is reacting to. This makes yields look like they are ‘anticipating’ target moves which results
in highly significant coefficients of yields in the policy rule. The cross-sectional response
of yields of different maturities to monetary policy shocks is monotonically decreasing in
maturity.
Finally, macroeconomic release surprises turn out to be temporary components in macroeconomic variables, in the sense that the impulse response of macro variables to these shocks
dies off after one month. Release surprises are here defined as difference between actual
released values (nonfarm payroll employment and CPI inflation) and analyst forecasts. In a
model in which the Fed reacts to current macroeconomic variables, this means that release
5

surprises can affect the conditional probability of target moves at only those FOMC meetings that are scheduled before the next macro release. In other words, release surprises are
not innovations to inertia-type state variables. In order to replicate the hump-shaped crosssectional response of yields to release surprises, the propagation of these surprises would
need to ‘live longer.’ This may be achieved by allowing for correlation between the release
surprises and the policy-inertia factor.5 Here, macroeconomic news have an impact on the
new desired target, but the FOMC only gradually implements this desired target over a
number of meetings.
Yield models with low-dimensional state vectors which are backed out from yields go back
to Merton (1974), Vasicek (1977) and Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985, CIR). The theoretical
frameworks of Duffie and Kan (1996) and El Karoui, Myneni and Viswanathan (1993) nest
most of the specifications estimated today, as they provide tractable bond-pricing formulas.
For empirical applications, see, for example, Anderson and Lund (1996), Dai and Singleton
(2000) and Ahn, Dittmar, and Gallant (2001). Even in models in which the state variables
are observable, they are usually not used in the estimation. For example, Pearson and Sun
(1994) estimate a nominal version of the CIR model, in which inflation is specified as a
factor, with yield data only. Campbell and Viceira (2000) is an exception, as they filter
latent variables using yields and CPI inflation.
A small number of papers address the yield curve and monetary policy. Babbs and
5

This amounts to attributing release surprises to latent variables, which avoids the need to specify the
dynamics of macroeconomic variables and their connection to the yield curve. This strategy is followed in
Fleming and Remolona (1999) who investigate the behavior of high-frequency yield data around macroeconomic news releases using a discrete-time Gaussian yield-curve model.

6

Webber (1993, 1996) and Farnsworth and Bass (2000) present theoretical yield-curve models
that capture some aspects of monetary policy. These models do not have tractable solutions
for yields and are therefore not taken to the data. Another group of papers estimates shortrate processes that reflect features of policy (Rudebusch (1995), Balduzzi, Das and Foresi
(1996), Balduzzi, Bertola, Foresi and Klapper (1998), Honoré (1997), Hamilton and Jorda
(2000), Das (2001)). The first three papers in this group use their estimated short-rate
process to compute long yields by invoking the expectation hypothesis. These long yields
are then taken to study the impact of Fed policy on the regression results by Campbell and
Shiller (1991). The same is done by Konstantinov (2000) who estimates a regime switching
model for the short rate with yields up to 1 year maturity. These papers do not estimate a
fully fledged yield-curve model nor do they study monetary policy shocks.
While VARs also capture bond yields and macroeconomic variables, they give rise to a
joint time-series process that implies arbitrage opportunities. Evans and Marshall (1998),
for example, estimate various VARs that amount to an unrestricted regression of bond yields
on different traditional monetary policy shock series. The assumption used to identify these
shocks is that the Fed ignores both current and past yield-curve information. Another strand
of literature uses a general equilibrium setting, which does imply the absence of arbitrage (for
example, Pennacchi (1991), Berardi (1998) and Jiltsov and Buraschi (1999)). The approach
I take also imposes no-arbitrage, while not requiring the specification and estimation of a
structural model of the economy, which in any case would be problematic given the current
state of empirical GE models of asset prices (see, for example, Hansen and Jagannathan
7

(1991). For a recent survey, see Cochrane (1998)).
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides some institutional background on
the operating procedures of U.S. monetary policy. Section 3 presents the general theoretical
framework with policy and the different versions of the model that are estimated. Section
4 describes the computation of the pricing formula, the simulation-based estimation technique, and the data. Sections 5 and 6 present estimation results obtained without and with
macroeconomic variables, respectively.

The Timing and Size of Target Changes
Important changes in 1994 to Fed-policy operating procedures underlie the choice of sam-

ple period in this paper, which focuses on the policy framework in place today. The Fed
conducts monetary policy by targeting the overnight rate in the federal funds market.The
FOMC fixes a value for the target and communicates it to the Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which then implements it through open-market operations
(Meulendyke (1998)). Figure 1 shows the fed funds market rate, the target rate together
with LIBOR and swap rates from 1994 to 1998. The Figure illustrates that deviations of the
fed funds rate from the target come in the form of short-lived spikes. (Section 4.5 provides a
description of the target data that is used in this paper.) These spikes are usually associated
with “settlement Wednesdays” and other special calendar effects, such as the end of the

year.6 Figure 1 also shows that target-rate changes are often followed by additional changes
in the same direction. This feature will be referred to as “policy inertia”.7
Starting with the first FOMC meeting of 1994, the Fed changed the timing and the size
of target moves. This change in operating procedures can be seen from Figure 2. The upper

During bi-weekly reserve-maintenance periods, banks must hold “good funds” in the form of cash or in
accounts at the Fed, or be penalized. These reserve-maintenance periods end on “settlement Wednesdays”.
7
Policy inertia, as defined here, does not only apply to the short period considered in the sample. For
example, from June 1989 to September 1992 the Fed lowered the target 25 times without a ever increasing
it. Policy inertia may indicate the Fed’s unwillingness to move the target immediately and entirely to its
desired rate. Instead, the Fed adjusts the target in small steps to avoid possible policy mistakes, because of
political motives, parameter uncertainty (Sack(1998)) or to affect long-maturity yields with minimal changes
in short yields (Woodford (1999)).

row of graphs consists of two histograms, pre-1994 and post-1994, of the number of days
between a target-rate change and the preceding FOMC meeting. If, in a given subperiod,
the Fed had moved its target only at FOMC meetings, there would be a single spike at 0
in the corresponding histogram. One sees a definite change in 1994 of re-targeting mainly
at FOMC meeting days, with two exceptions highlighted in Figure 2. The first exception
occurred on April 18, 1994 after high car sales in March, a leading business-cycle indicator.
The financial press speculated that the surprise move was intended as a manifestation of
authority by Alan Greenspan, as no vote was held on the move.8 The second exception was
decided upon in a conference call on October 15, 1998, and came in response to the Russian
financial crises.9 The lower row of graphs in Figure 2 shows the histogram of target changes
for the two subperiods. While pre-1994 target-rate changes came in multiples of 6.25 basis
points (0.0625 percentage points), after 1994 the Fed used multiples of quarter-percentage
points.

the target θ solves the stochastic differential equation (SDE)

dθ(t) = 0.0025 (dNU − dND ) ,

(1)

where NU and ND are counting processes with stochastic intensities λU and λD , respectively.
Jumps in NU and ND increase the target by 25 bp, while jumps in ND lower the target by
the same amount. Heuristically, the probability of a Poisson jump in NU during the interval
[t, t + ∆] conditional on information up to time t is given by λU (t)∆, and the expression for
jumps in ND is analogous. The econometrician has discrete observations on the difference
between NU and ND , which means that he observes target moves that are multiples of 25
bp.
The Fed sets the target in response to the state of the economy X that lives in some state
space D ⊂ RN . More precisely, the Fed’s policy decision at time t is based on the value of
X ‘just before’ time t, which is denoted X(t−) = lims↑t X(s). The conditional probability of
a target move varies according to the FOMC meeting calendar. The arrival rate of ‘regular’
target moves at FOMC meetings depends on the state X of the economy. Then there is
a small and constant probability of an emergency move outside of FOMC meetings (‘Peso
events’). More precisely, FOMC meetings are taken to be intervals, the i-th meeting being

12

[e
tM (i), tM (i)]. The arrival rates λU and λD are given by

otherwise,

for j = U (“up”) and D (“down”).
The analogy between the target process (1) and descriptions of Fed behavior in the Taylor
rule literature can be seen more easily by defining the martingale M = MU − MD , where Mj
is the compensated process given by {Mj (t) = Nj (t) −

Rt

λj (t)dt ; t ≥ 0} for j = U, D (see

Brémaud (1981) for further details). Then the dynamics of the target can be rewritten as


dθ(t) = κ(t) θ(t−) − θ(t−) dt + 0.0025 dM (t),

(3)

where the process θ is a linear function of the state X with coefficients dictated by the
intensity parameters. This representation shows that, during times at which the deterministic
scalar κ(t) is positive, the target is expected to move back towards θ(t−). The expected value
of θ(t) (and of the average target over some period) conditional on information at time s ≤ t
is linear in X(s). This expected value is thus directly comparable to the Taylor rule, for
example, which links the average federal funds rate to measures of inflation and output at a
quarterly frequency.10
10

At a quarterly frequency, the difference between the average fed funds and average target rate is tiny.
Given the convention that [t, t + 1] spans one year, the conditional expected value of the average target over
[s, t] can be computed exactly using s − t = 0.25.

13

To economize on parameters, the slope parameters are taken to be symmetric, in that

X . Mean-reversion in the target is also imposed by assuming λ0 = λ0 +2λX x,

where x denotes the long-run mean of X. The arrival rates of Peso events are fixed to their
empirical frequency. There has been one up and one down move outside of FOMC meetings
the 5 years from 1994 to 1998, so that I set λUP = λD
P = 0.2. For given long-run mean
parameters, there are thus N + 1 free parameters: λU0 and λX .

3.2

General State Dynamics (including Target)

The state X(t) at time t includes the target rate θ(t), some macro variables m(t), and
analyst forecasts mF (t) of these macro variables. All these state variables are observable.
The remaining state variables are unobservable (or latent). Among these is the short rate
and thus the spread s(t) = r(t)−θ(t). The main reason for this approach is that the spikes in
the fed funds rate (see Figure 1) call for a detailed specification of the underlying seasonality
similar to Hamilton (1996), which would add a large number of parameters. This complexity
can be avoided by backing out the short rate from longer term yields.
The general dynamics of X are described by an SDE of the form

dX(t) = µ(X(t)) dt + σ(X(t)) dW (t) + dJ(t),

(4)

where W is a vector of Brownian motions, µ is the drift, σ is the volatility, and J is a pure
jump process. The drift µ(x) and the variance-covariance term σ(x)σ(x)> are linear functions

14

of the state x. Without jumps and with constant σ, this system may be thought of as a
Gaussian vector-autoregression with mean rate of change µ. Taking the variance-covariance
σσ > to be state-dependent allows for conditional heteroscedasticity. More importantly, the
jumps J can capture ‘macroeconomic jump effects’, such as policy events and macroeconomic
releases. Here, jumps do not necessarily capture ‘large moves’ in yields (as in the short-rate
studies of Das (2001) and Johannes (2001)), but observable changes in X that happen at
distinct points in time.
The specification of jumps differs from existing parametric models (Duffie and Kan
(1996), El Karoui, Myneni and Viswanathan (1993)) to capture different operating procedures of monetary policy and macroeconomic news releases. The linearity assumption on
µ and σσ | combined with parametric assumptions on the distribution of J defines a new class
of continuous-time Markov processes labelled linear-quadratic jump-diffusions (LQJDs). To
describe the properties of this class of processes, I partition the state vector as X = (X 1 , X2 ),
so that X2 is a k2 -dimensional process, with k1 + k2 = N . Without loss of generality (k2
may be zero), the subvector X2 is assumed to be Gauss-Markov, which means that the lower
k2 components of ∆X(t) are always zero. In what follows, whenever the term ‘quadratic’ is
used, it refers to squaring Gaussian processes (for details, see Appendix A). There can be
jumps at
• scheduled announcements (deterministic points in time): The distribution of the jump
size ∆X(t) conditional on information ‘just before’ the deterministic jump time t may
depend on the state X(t−). In particular, the moment generating function of the
15

conditional distribution is an exponential linear-quadratic (LQ) function of X(t−).
• unscheduled announcements (random points in time): Random jump times τ arrive
with intensities which are LQ functions of the state. The distribution of ∆X(τ ) is
state independent.
There is thus a dichotomy between state dependence of the jump-size distribution on the one
hand and of jump timing on the other. This separation turns out to be crucial for bond prices
to have closed form solutions. In this paper, I use scheduled announcements to model releases
of employment and CPI numbers. The requirement on the moment generating function of
these jumps is satisfied, for example, by a Gaussian distribution with LQ mean in X(t−)
and constant variance. The target process is based on jumps at unscheduled announcements
with time-varying arrival intensities, because there is always a small probability of a ‘Peso
move’ outside of FOMC meetings. Moreover, target changes come in discrete amounts and,
even more importantly, a zero move always has positive probability. The distribution of
target changes therefore does not satisfy the condition on the moment generating function
of jumps at scheduled announcements.

3.3

Negative Probabilities of Target Moves?

Negative correlation between the conditional probabilities of up and down moves in the
target is important for a description of the countercyclical interest-rate targeting by the
Fed. The linear arrival intensities λU and λD in (2) allow for such negative correlation.
While quadratic intensities also admit this feature, the linear specification has the further
16

advantages that the map from states to yields is invertible and, even more importantly, that
the target rate can revert to a mean. With a state-independent jump size distribution, the
only way to achieve this is to allow the arrival rates to depend on θ. Since the target is
not Gaussian and LQJDs only square Gaussian processes (as laid out in Appendix A), this
dependence has to be linear. Invertibility of the pricing map means that the model can be
estimated with a method that relies on the likelihood function of the state vector.
The main disadvantage of (2) is that intensities may become negative.11 For the model to
be well defined, I therefore assume that (2) defines the intensities of an approximating yieldcurve model, while the true intensities are truncated versions given by max{λj , 0}, j = U, D.
These truncated linear intensities are outside of the LQJD class, and a closed-form solution
for bond yields is no longer available. The quality of the approximating model can be
checked at a given parameter using Monte-Carlo methods (see Section 5.1). The idea of
using a tractable yield-curve model as an approximation usually also underlies papers that
estimate nominal short-rate processes that may become negative (which are most papers in
the literature, including this one). The true short rate in this case is given by max{r, 0}.
11

Negative correlation of intensities with positive domain force a violation of assumption Condition A in
Duffie and Kan (1996). In the absence of jumps, the condition is sufficient for the existence of a solution to
the stochastic differential equation (4) describing the state. As already noted by Duffie and Liu (2001), it
is possible to square two Gaussian processes so that each variable takes only positive values, while allowing
for arbitrary correlation. This idea is applied here to the case of jumps.

17

3.4

Other State Variables

All estimated setups share the feature that that the state vector X includes the target as
observable variable and the spread s = r − θ as latent, with s mean-reverting to zero. The
fat tails of the spread distribution can be captured with a stochastic volatility factor v. The
most interesting variable is called policy inertia factor z, which proxies variables (in addition
to s, θ and v) to which the Fed reacts when setting the target. The arrival intensities (2) of
policy moves during FOMC meetings may depend on all these variables in X. The dynamics
of these additional state variable solve

ds(t) = −κs s(t) dt +

p
v(t)dWs (t),

dv(t) = κv (v − v(t)) dt + σv

p
v(t)dWv (t),

(5)

dz(t) = −κz z(t) dt + dWz (t),

where Ws , Wv and Wz are independent standard Brownian motions.
The four-dimensional state vector X = (θ, s, v, z) does not yet include macro variables.
Section 6 tries link the latent information in z to observable macro variables by augmenting
the state X with employment and CPI inflation. I also report the estimation results of three
factor versions of the model. First, it is interesting to see whether the information the Fed
cares about shows up in some other variable when the inertia factor is omitted, in which case
X = (θ, s, v). Second, yields have started to look ‘more Gaussian’ in the 1990s (in terms
of the tails of the histogram of yield changes). Constant volatility σs =
18

√

v might thus be

sufficient to capture yields.
The continuous specification of s implies that the short rate always jumps one-to-one with
the target. Whether this assumption is sensible is hard to judge from, say, funds-rate data
only (which is one of the reasons to work with an unobservable short rate). Some confidence
in this assumption can be gained from the behavior of the funds rate around target changes
in Figure 1, which is particularly evident for the year 1994. An easy extension is to let the
spread jump by some fixed or state-independent random amount.

3.5

Solving for the Yield Curve

Arbitrage-free pricing now specifies an exogenous risk-adjustment in the form of a ‘density
process’ ξ. Asset prices are then given by the conditional expected value of their payoff,
weighted by ξ, and discounted at the riskless short rate r In particular, the time-t price of a
zero-coupon bond price that matures at time T is

P (t, T ) = Et



 Z t

ξ(T )
exp −
r(u)du ,
ξ(t)
0

(6)

where Et denotes expectation given the information available to bond investors at time t. In a
Lucas (1978) economy, for example, the term inside the expectation is just the marginal rate
of substitution of a representative agent. The weight ξ can be used to define a risk-neutral
probability measure Q which satisfies Et [Zξ(s)/ξ(t)] = EtQ (Z) for any random variable Z
known at time s for which this expectation exist. If such a risk-neutral measure Q exists,
19

there is no arbitrage, at least under reasonable restrictions on trading strategies (Harrison
and Kreps (1979), Harrison and Pliska (1981)). Conversely, the absence of arbitrage, and
some technical conditions, implies the existence of a risk-neutral measure (Delbaen and
Schachermayer (1994)).
The computation of a solution P (t, T ) to (6) can be performed only in a few special
cases by hand. For example, if r is Gaussian under the risk-neutral measure Q, then this
just involves taking the expectation of a sum of Gaussians, which can be computed directly
(Vasicek (1977)). For the general case in which X is a LQJD under Q, the idea is first to
guess that bond prices are given by the exponential LQ form

P (t, T ) = exp (c0 (t, T ) + c1 (t, T )X(t) + X(t)| c2 (t, T )X(t)) ,

(7)

for some coefficients c(t, T ) = (c0 (t, T ), c1 (t, T ), c2 (t, T )) ∈ R × RN × RN ×N that depend on
the particular ordering of deterministic jump dates between t and T . This guess is verified
by computing c(t, T ) recursively using the method of undetermined coefficients, starting
at the time T of maturity with the boundary condition c(T, T ) = 0, implied by the fact
that P (T, T ) = 1, and from the assumption that D contains an open set. Proposition 1 in
Appendix B.3 states this result.
The recursive computation of bond prices (and thus coefficients) iterates two steps.
Roughly speaking, the first step (Lemma 1 in Appendix B.6) shows that if the bond price
at the next deterministic jump date is an exponential LQ function in the state vector, as in
20

(7), then the price of a bond “just before” the jump date is of the same form. The second
step (Lemma 2 in Appendix B.7) demonstrates that if the bond price “just before” the next
deterministic jump date is given by the exponential LQ form (7), then the price during the
entire interim period between two deterministic jump dates solves a partial differential equation that also has an exponential LQ solution. Together, these two steps guarantee that for
every t, the price P (t, T ) inherits the postulated form.

3.6

Risk Adjustment

The density process ξ solves dξ = −ξσξ dW, where W = (Ws , Wv , Wz ), so that a standard
Brownian motion W Q under Q solves dW Q = dW +σξ dt. The market prices σξ of uncertainty
for the Brownian motions are of the form




(8)

leading to time-varying risk premia that are affine in the volatility factor v. The three factor
versions of the model do not need some of the components in σξ . In particular, if volatility
σs is constant, σξs is constant as well. The parametrization of σξ also captures risk aversion
against target moves that are driven by s, v and z. This means that even without market
prices of uncertainty for NU and ND , the intensities under the risk-neutral measure Q may
differ from their values under the data-generating measure because of their state-dependence.

21

With only 5 years of data, I chose to set the market prices of jump uncertainty for target-rate
moves to zero. For example, λU0 is hard to estimate even without any risk adjustment.

Estimation Technique and Data
This section describes the simulation-based method used to approximate the joint likeli-

hood function of the target, LIBOR and swap rates, which is not available in closed form.
Moreover, it presents the approximation of the pricing map used in the estimation.

4.1

Estimation Problem

Let fX ( · , t|Xt̃ , t̃; γ) denote the true density of the state vector Xt conditional on the last
observation Xt̃ at some t̃ < t. The parameter vector γ contains parameters describing the
true distribution of X and parameters governing the market prices of uncertainty. This density involves the nonlinear stochastic intensities in (2). Let p( · , γ) denote the true mapping
from factors to observed yields and the target for a given γ, in that p(Xt , γ) = Yt , where Yt is
the vector of observables at time t: yields and the target rate θt . Assume that p( · , γ) can be
inverted to obtain the factors as function q( · , γ) of the observables Yt , in that Xt = q(Yt , γ).
Ideally, the model would be estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the observations
over γ, which can be obtained by a change of variables from the conditional densities of the
state variables. For example, the conditional density f ( · , t | Yt̃, t̃; γ) of Yt given Yt̃ at t̃ < t is

22

given by



f Yt , t | Yt̃ , t̃; γ = fX q(Yt , γ), t | q(Yt̃, γ), t̃; γ |5Y q(Yt , γ)| .

(9)

Three problems arise. First, the true density fX of the state variables is not available in
closed form. I therefore extend the simulated maximum likelihood (SML) method of Pedersen
(1995) and Brandt and Santa-Clara (2001) to jump-diffusions (Section 4.2). Second, the true
maps p and q are not available in closed form. In this high-dimensional setting, Monte-Carlo
integration to recover p( · , γ) is prohibitively expensive. This roadblock is bypassed by
using an approximating LQJD model, for which the Jacobian term in (9) can be calculated
analytically. A hill-climbing procedure based on analytical derivatives inverts the map from
states to LIBOR and swap yields numerically for each observation (Section 4.3). Third, an
exact computation of yield coefficients for the approximating LQJD model is computationally
intensive, so I employ a time-saving algorithm (Section 4.4).

4.2

Density Approximation (SML)

The conditional density of the likelihood function of the underlying state vector solves
a partial differential-integral equation that has a closed-form solution only for a few special
cases, such as Gaussian and square-root diffusions (see Lo (1988)). To overcome this problem,
SML is used, which attains approximate efficiency similar to the efficient method of moments

23

technique by Gallant and Tauchen (1996).12 The density fX ( · , t | x̃, t̃) of the state X(t)
conditional on the last observation X(t̃) = x̃ can be written, using Bayes’ Rule and the
Markov property of X, as

fX (x, t | x̃, t̃) =

Z

D

fX (x, t | w, t − h) fX (w, t − h | x̃, t̃) dw,

(10)

for any time interval h. (This is sometimes called the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.) SML
computes (10) by Monte-Carlo integration, replacing the density fX ( · , t | w, t − h) by the
density of a discretization of X. The method is extended in Appendix C.1 to allow for jumpdiffusions. Particular care needs to be taken to accommodate time-dependent stochastic
intensities.13

4.3

Pricing-Formula Approximation

Modeling the target-rate with jump intensities defined by (2) introduces a form of nonlinearity that takes the state vector outside of the LQJD class as mentioned in Section 3.
12

EMM implements a simulated method of moments estimator with moments generated by the scores of
an auxiliary semi-nonparametric (SNP) density. The SNP density is a Hermite expansion (with analytical
scores) that approaches the true density as the degree of the polynomial increases. In the case of SML, the
simulated moments are scores from the discretized model. An alternative approximately efficient estimator
for is proposed by Singleton (2001), who computes explicit moments using the conditional characteristic
function ψ( · ) of X, defined by ψ(u) = Et−1 [exp(i u> Xt )]. Efficiency is achieved by increasing the number
of different values taken on by u with one moment associated with each choice of u. This estimator can also
be used in the LQJD setting, as the characteristic function can also be obtained in closed form. While SML
is used here as a potentially helpful alternative to EMM, the computational costs of explicit moments as in
Singleton (2001) are prohibitive in the present seasonal setting.
13
Like any simulation-based technique, SML is computationally intensive. Unfortunately, the application
in this paper does not share the advantage of analytical gradients with Brandt and Santa-Clara (2001),
because the map p(Xt , γ) involves the numerical computation of ODEs that depend on the parameters.
The numerical optimization procedure is therefore based on the Nelder-Mead simplex method, starting a
gradient-based parameter search only after the simplex algorithm has collapsed.

24

The quality of an approximating pricing formula Yt = p̃(Xt , γ) that ignores the truncation
by the max-operator in (2) depends crucially on how severely the positivity constraint on
the intensities is binding (and on the average impact of hitting the constraint). The inverse
q̃( · , γ) of the approximating map p̃ is defined in the obvious way. Let
γ0
D+
:= {x ∈ D : λj0 + λjX x ≥ γ0j , j = U, D}

denote the set of states at which the intensity formula is bounded below by a given constant
0
γ0j , for j = U, D. The approximation q̃( · , γ) is likely to be better at states in D+
.

Two estimation approaches can be taken. The first approach is simply to replace p in
(9) by p̃ and obtain an estimator of γ by maximizing the total approximate likelihood
Y

(t̃,t)∈I

f˜(Yt , t | Yt̃ , t̃; γ) =

fX q̃(Yt , γ), t | q̃(Yt̃ , γ), t̃; γ |5Y q̃(Yt , γ)| ,

where I denotes pairs of successive observation times in the data set. Here, the true factor
dynamics (captured by fX ) are combined with the inverse q̃ of the approximating map from
factors to yields. Since there is no restriction here on the parameter space, the approach is
labeled unconstrained estimation. The accuracy of this approximation of the likelihood can
be assessed ex post by checking whether the functions p and p̃ are close at the estimated
parameter γ̂.

25

One might be concerned that, without a-priori restrictions on the parameter space, it
is unlikely that a good approximation of p would obtain at the estimated parameter value.
Even though this turned out not to be a problem in the application below, an alternative
approach was also tried. Specifically, consider performing the constrained estimation

In words, the parameter space is restricted to contain only those parameters at which the
observations are explained by a factor realization q̃(Yt , γ) for which the γ0 -constraint never
binds. The special case that was tried in this paper is γ0 = 0. Naturally these two problems
typically deliver distinct estimators. Any such differences will be further discussed when the
estimates are presented.

4.4

Coefficient Approximation

Time dependencies introduced by scheduled announcements, such as FOMC meetings and
macro releases, immensely increase the computational burden associated with the solution of
the approximating LQJD model for yields, and render almost impossible an estimation using
data for long-maturity yields. For example, in order to evaluate the likelihood function, the
5-year swap rate needs to be computed for each observation in the sample. In the setup of

26

Section 6, this takes 16 minutes on a SUN workstation.14 In setups with only one type of
scheduled announcement (at FOMC meetings), the coefficients are therefore computed using
the following approximation: the time until the next FOMC meetings is matched exactly
only for the next-to-occur meeting. The subsequent meetings are assumed to be equally
spaced over the year. For the maturities of the yields used in the estimation (6 months and
above), the errors due to this approximation are virtually undetectable. In setups with more
than one type of scheduled announcement (FOMC meetings and macro announcements),
such an approximation is no longer accurate and is not pursued in this paper.

4.5

Data

The target rate is on average higher than short Treasury rates, because the Fed is operating in a market where loans are not collateralized, while tax effects and other factors
further depress Treasuries. For example, the average daily target rate from 1994 to 1998 is
5.22%, while the 3-month T-bill and the 3-month LIBOR-rate averaged 5.06% and 5.44%,
respectively. The empirical results reported here are therefore based on LIBOR and swap
rates.15 The sample period considered in the estimation is January 1, 1994 to December
31, 1998. The dates of FOMC meetings were obtained from the Board of Governors of the
14

The computation simulates 9 coefficients (for each of the 8 state variables plus a constant) for 10 different
bond maturities (0.5, 1, . . . , 4.5, 5 years) for each of the 261 observations, using Runge-Kutta solutions of the
ODEs for the coefficients.
15
LIBOR-quality swap rates are minimally affected by credit risk because of their special contractual
netting features, although they do trade at spreads to Treasuries that have, to this point, resisted a convincing
explanation (see, for example, Collin-Dufresne and Solnik (2001)). For example, the 2, 5 and 10-year average
swap rates were 6.08%, 6.48% and 6.79% during the post-1994 period, respectively, while the same maturities
had average percentage yields in the Treasury market of 5.81, 6.13, and 6.34.

27

Federal Reserve. The FOMC meets eight times a year. Two of these meetings, the first
and the fourth, extend over two days. In the past, if the Fed changed its target during one
of these two-day meetings, the announcement was always made on the second of the two
meeting days. The target-rate series used in this paper differs from the series in Datastream
with respect to the timing of the target change during the two-day meeting of February
1994. Datastream assigns the change to the first meeting day (February 3), while the change
was announced on the second meeting day (The New York Times, February 5, 1994, page 1,
“Federal Reserve, Changing Course, Raises a Key Rate” by Keith Bradsher).
LIBOR data are from the British Bankers’ Association, while swap rates are from Intercapital Brokers Limited. Both series are obtained through Datastream. LIBOR rates are
recorded at 11 a.m. London time, while swap rates are recorded at the end of the UK business
day. Target-rate changes are typically announced from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern time. 16
This means that a move in the target on Tuesday, March 1, affects recorded LIBOR rates
on Wednesday, March 2. The effect on recorded swap yields is not so precisely separable.
The data sample is therefore constructed by using Thursday (London time) observations of
LIBOR and swap yields, together with Wednesday (Eastern time) observations of the target
rate. The asynchronous nature of the observations is ignored in the estimation. Whenever
the respective day was a holiday, the observation of the previous business day was used.
The bond-pricing formula (7) extends as written to the case of LIBOR bonds, treating
r as a default-adjusted discount rate (Duffie and Singleton (1997)). The 6-month LIBOR

For example: Sep 29, 1998 at 2:15 p.m., Oct 15, 1998 at 3:15 p.m., Nov 17, 1998 at 2:15 p.m.

rate is denoted Y (t, t + 0.5). An interest-rate swap is a contract between two parties to
exchange fixed and floating coupons for a stipulated time, say τ years. One party receives
a semi-annual floating payment in form of the 6-month LIBOR rate and pays in exchange
a fixed coupon rate, the swap rate. At the initiation of the swap contract, the swap rate is
set so that the value of the swap contract is zero. For simplicity, swap rates Y (t, t + τ ) are
treated as par-coupon rates on LIBOR-quality bonds of the same maturity, putting aside
the distinct institutional features and differences in default risk of LIBOR and LIBOR-swap
markets, so that

Y (t, t + τ ) = P2τ

Estimation Results
The same set of yields (6-month LIBOR, 2 and 5-year swap) and the target are used for

all estimations, creating the need to break the stochastic singularity arising from the exact
map of three factors in four observed variables in the lower-dimensional systems. I therefore
assume that the 2-year swap rate is observed with measurement error.17 As this section
investigates the properties of the estimated models, the concept of model-implied factors
will be needed. These are obtained by inverting the map from factors to the target rate,

The measurement error of the 2-year swap rate turns out to be persistent, with a weekly autocorrelation
coefficient that varies across models from 0.95 to 0.98, and a standard deviation that varies from 12 to 21
basis points. This is comparable to other yield-curve estimations (see, for example, Duffie and Singleton
(1997)).

and to those yields that are assumed to be observed without error at the SML estimates.
The map from factors to yields is given by the pricing formulas (12) from the approximating
model.

5.1

Accuracy of the Approximating Model

As the true state process X is not actually of the LQJD class, because of (2), it is
important to study the accuracy of the approximating model. From the swap-yield formula
(12), one can see that it is sufficient to investigate the approximation accuracy for zerocoupon yields. Zero-coupon yields Y0 (t, T ) for each observation t in the sample implied
by the true (nonlinear) model can be computed with Monte Carlo integration. Consider
simulating S paths of the short rate for times i = t + h, t + 2h, . . . , T − h starting with the
model-implied state x at time t. The time t yield of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time
T is then

Y0 (t, T )=

These calculations are performed using S = 10, 000 and h = 1/365. FOMC meeting days
are additionally subdivided into 30 intervals. Given these choices, the standard errors of the
30

Monte-Carlo approximation of the true yields for even the 5-year yield are sufficiently small,
from 0.93 to 1.79 basis points.
These zero-coupon yields implied by the true model can be compared to the yields from
the approximating model that are based on the same model-implied state vector. Table 1
shows that the mean absolute approximation error is around 1-3 basis points, with a standard
deviation of 1-2 basis points for the constrained model without inertia factor z and an even
smaller error for the full model. The approximation error for these specifications is thus of
similar magnitude as the bid-ask spread of swaps. The unconstrained estimates of the model
without z and all other 3-factor versions produce about 5 times the approximation error,
which seems too large to be acceptable.

5.2

Cross-Sectional Fit of the Approximating Model

An important measure of cross-sectional out-of-sample fit for any yield-curve model is
the pricing error made when predicting yields that were not included in the estimation.
Pricing errors are defined as the difference between actual yields and the model-implied
yields computed by inserting the model-implied factors into the swap formulas (12). Modelimplied yields are based on the approximating model, so that the pricing errors not only
reflect model misspecification, but also approximation error. Table 2 reports the average
absolute pricing errors and their sample standard deviations for the base-case models and
for the Dai and Singleton (2000, DS) model as a point of reference. The DS parameters are
estimated with weekly data on the same LIBOR and swap rates with the exception of using

NOTE: This table presents summary statistics about the approximation errors in basis points made by the
approximating models over the sample January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1998. “W/o Stoch. Vol” refers to
(5) with constant σs , while “W/o Inertia” takes out the z process so that X = (θ, s, v). “Con.” refers to the
constrained estimation as in (11), “Unc.” to the unconstrained counterpart. Due to the seasonality introduced
by FOMC meetings, the approximation errors in this setup depend on time t even for a given value of the
state vector. The table therefore reports the mean average absolute approximation error |Y (t, T ) − Y 0 (t, T )|
and its standard deviation over the sample (first and second row). The table also reports the average
standard errors of the Monte Carlo approximation of true yields Y0 (t, T ) (third row). These are obtained
using the Delta method by viewing the simulated bond price P̂ (t, T ) at time t as the estimated mean of an

the sample used in this paper (April 3, 1987 to August 23, 1996). The parameters have not
been reestimated.
The pricing errors of the unconstrained full model and its version without stochastic
volatility are lowest among these. The model without stochastic vol matches the short end
of the yield curve extremely well with average absolute errors of around 6 to 13 basis points.
In addition to matching the short end well, with 11-26 bp errors, the full model produces
low errors, of around 2 bp, at the long end of the curve. As can be seen from the table, the

NOTE: This table presents the mean and the standard deviation of the absolute value of the pricing error
in basis points over the weekly data sample from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1998 made by the
approximating model and, as a reference, for the DS model (at their parameter estimates). The definition
of models is as in Table 1. Using their sample period, DS report mean pricing errors for weekly 3, 5 and
7 year swaps rates of -11.3, 16.9 and -12.7 basis points with standard deviations of 9.6, 16.5 and 10.1 basis
points.

latter model does better than the DS model, especially at the short end. The incorporation
of the target as a fourth factor appears to provide a manageable way of fixing the short end
of the yield curve.
Taking out the z variable produces overall higher pricing errors (ranging from 8 to 18 bp)
when the model is evaluated at the constrained parameter vector, and about 1-7 bp higher
than that for the unconstrained parameter.18 Given the small pricing errors of unconstrained
full model, this will be the model I will focus mostly on in the following analysis.
18

While pricing errors are a measure of first moments that depends on the realized path of yields through
the use of model-implied factors, a history-independent check can be obtained by simulating 20, 000 samples
of weekly yields. The average 6-month LIBOR, 2 and 5-year swap rates in these simulated samples are 5.59,
5.76 and 5.89%, respectively, which shows better how the high persistence of yields makes it difficult to
match first moments.

5.3

Interpretation of Model-Implied Factors

The spread s represents money-market noise which only affects short maturities. Table
3 shows that this feature is shared by all models (as defined in Section 5). Under the
data-generating probability measure, the short rate quickly reverts to the target, which in
turn reverts to a parameter θ̄ that is fixed to its sample mean, 5.22%. The speed κs of
mean-reversion is highest in the full model, implying a weekly autoregressive coefficient of
exp(−κs /52) = 0.83 and a half life of shocks to the spread of less than 1 month. Under the
risk-neutral measure, spread shocks die out fast as well, which implies that they only matter
for short yields. Figure 3 computes, for the full model, the linear dependence of zero-coupon
yields on all factors, as a function of maturity. These yield coefficients can be interpreted as
responses of yields to the various shocks because the shocks are uncorrelated. The response
of yields to changes in the spread s is monotonically decreasing with maturity, which means
that s is a “slope factor” in the language of Litterman and Scheinkman (1993).
Shocks to the target persist under both probability measures which leads to positive
autocorrelation in the target level. This will be referred to as interest-rate smoothing. Target
shocks therefore mostly affect short yields and less long yields, as can be seen from Figure
3. This monotone reaction of yields is usually called liquidity effect. In other words, both
s and θ are “slope factors”, but act on different parts of the yield curve, as the impact of
target increases dies off more slowly with maturity than do the impacts of shocks to s.
The Fed conducts monetary policy by slowly pulling the target (and thus the short rate)

towards a desired rate that is mostly captured by z (under both probability measures). This
can be seen from Table 4 which documents that arrival rates of Fed moves are most highly
correlated with the inertia factor z. Positive shocks to z increase the likelihood of a target
move not only at the next FOMC meeting, but also at subsequent meetings, because their
half live is 1 year (again, under both measures) from Table 3. This means that certain
shocks to the economy affect the target and thus short-term rates only with some delay, and
thereby induce positive autocorrelation in target changes. This positive autocorrelation in
changes is labelled policy inertia. Figure 3 shows that the anticipated cumulative effect of
subsequent target moves on yields is highest for maturities around 2 years. At sufficiently
long maturities, beyond 2 years, mean reversion in the target and the inertia factor causes
shocks to have smaller and smaller impacts on longer and longer rates. The net effect is a
hump-shaped coefficient on z, which means that z is a “curvature factor” in the language of

NOTE: To obtain a measure of importance of a factor for the stochastic intensities of policy events, this table
shows the correlation between changes in the model-implied factors (s, θ, v, z) and changes in the function
λ0 + λs s(t) + λθ θ(t) + λv v(t) + λz z(t) for the weekly sample from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1998.
The definition of models is the same as in Table 1.

Litterman and Scheinkman (1993).
Shocks to volatility v affect yields at all maturities, reflecting the strong persistence of
volatility (under both measures). In this sense, v is a “level factor”.
The comparison of model-implied variables across models in Table 5 shows that the latent
variables z and v roughly correspond to the stochastic mean “θ” and volatility “v” factors
of the DS model, as can be seen from their correlation of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. The
commovements with yields indicate that z behaves much like the 2-year swap rate, and that
v is related to the 5-year swap rate. The two models imply, however, very different short
rates. The sample mean of the model-implied r in the DS model is -0.46%, while the average
r in the full model is 5.02%. The full model implies that r is closely related to the short end
of the yield curve, while the DS model produces a short rate that behaves like the slope at
the short end of the yield curve. This can be seen from the correlations between the modelimplied short rates r from the two models and the LIBOR rate (0.54 for the full model and
−0.05 for the DS model), and the difference between the 2-year swap and the LIBOR rate

NOTE: This table computes the correlation of the first differences of model-implied factors (r, z and v)
from the unconstrained estimations, the model-implied factors (r, θ, v) of the “A1 (3)DS model” by Dai and
Singleton (2000) (at their estimated parameter vector), the 6-month LIBOR rate, the 2 and 5-year swap
rates, and the target rate θ over the sample January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1998. The definition of models
is the same as in Table 1. All correlations with the target rate are computed using the subsample of FOMC
meetings.

(0.58 for the full and 0.86 for the DS model).
Similar to the full model, the short rate r in the three factor versions is correlated most
highly with the shortest yield in the estimation. In the model without inertia factor z, r is
less related to longer yields than in the version without stochastic volatility v. This can also
be seen from the estimated mean-reversion parameter κs , higher for the model without z than
for the one without v, and its correlation with target-rate changes on FOMC meetings, which
is also higher in the model without z. This may be explained by the fact that, for a nonzero
market price qs of uncertainty, the model without z has the additional flexibility of allowing
r to revert under Q to the continuous variable v, while the conditional mean of r between
FOMC meetings under the risk-neutral measure is constant in the model with constant vol.

38

The second latent factor in these models behaves much like the longest yield from Table 5.
They mean-revert at about the same slow rate and are in fact highly correlated, but almost
uncorrelated with their short rate r. This may indicate that the role of v as conditional
second moment of r is dominated by its importance of setting the arrival intensity of policy
moves.

5.4

Snake-Shaped Volatility Curve

Figure 4 shows the standard deviation of yield changes as a function of maturity, the
so-called term structure of volatility (or ‘vol curve’). The vol curve is “snake-shaped,” in
that volatility is high at the very short end, declines until maturities about 3-6 months, after
which it has a “hump” at a maturity of 2 years. The graph also shows the vol curve in
simulated data from the full model, which reproduces the overall “snake-shaped” pattern
quite well. The “head of the snake” at the short end is generated by money-market shocks,
shocks to the spread, which only affect short yields. The “back of the snake”, the hump at
2 years, has already been documented by Litterman, Scheinkman and Weiss (1988).
Informal accounts (for example, Fleming and Remolona (1999)) conjectured that monetary policy is responsible for the hump. This claim is here validated in the sense that the
source of the hump are shocks to the inertia factor z which only enter the model through
their impact on the arrival rates of policy moves. Rates at medium maturities such as 2
years respond immediately to the anticipated cumulative effects of z-shocks on the target,
and thus have greater volatility then do the Fed-dampened short rates. Mean reversion in

The volatility curve is measured as standard deviations of yield changes. The weekly data are Wednesday
observations from 1994 to 1998 on the target rate, overnight repo rate, and Thursday observations on the

simulating the state dynamics for 10 years, starting at the unconditional mean. Each day is subdivided into

the target then leads to smaller volatilities for longer maturity yields. This means that the
hump in the yield-coefficient on the inertia factor translates into a hump in the vol curve.
The volatility in the data is higher around FOMC meetings, especially for short maturities.
This seasonality is also present in the model, where it is generated by shocks to the target
rate, which happen mostly at FOMC meetings. The model overstates this seasonality around
FOMC meetings, because shocks to the target do not die out fast enough in the estimated
model.

Implied Discrete-Choice Model of Policy

From each of the yield-curve setups, it is possible to derive a discrete-choice model in
which, at each FOMC meeting, the Fed is viewed as randomizing over three possible policy
choices: up move, down move or no move. The conditional probability of a particular choice
at the FOMC meeting at t depends on the state “right before” t and is obtained from its
empirical frequency in a simulated sample of size S = 10, 000 that is generated by simulating
forward in steps of one day’s length starting at the actual value of the implied state at the
last observation. These conditional probabilities from the full model are plotted in Figure
5 for each FOMC meeting. (Outside of FOMC meetings, the discrete-choice model assigns
a small and constant probability to Peso events.) The conditional likelihood of moves up is
very high at the end of 1994, when in fact the Fed increased the target in several steps, and
again quite large around the target increase in March 1997. The conditional probability of
moves down is high in 1995/96 and 1998, both years in which the Fed lowered the rate on

several occasions.
To see whether these conditional probabilities provide a good description of target dynamics, Table 6 compares forecasts by the model-implied discrete choice to forecasts based
on alternative ways to describe target-rate moves. A forecast is taken to be the alternative
with the highest conditional probability. As there have been only 7 increases and 5 decreases
in the target at FOMC meetings over the sample period 1994-1998, these results suffer from
small-sample noise, and are not intended to offer a serious forecasting comparison. They do
provide, however, a device that helps to understand the implications of the model regarding
Fed moves. The standard reference setup, usually labeled ‘constant probability model,’ is a
version of the discrete-choice model in which the conditional probabilities are set equal to
their empirical frequencies. For target moves, these frequencies are small (7/40 for “up” and
5/40 for “down”), so that this version always forecasts that the Fed is not going to change

NOTE: The sample used in this table is January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1998.
During this time, there have been 40 FOMC meetings, 8 moves up in the target (1
outside of an FOMC meeting) and 6 moves down (1 outside of an FOMC meeting).
This means that in a constant probability model, the estimated probability of a
move up and down is 7/40 and 5/40, respectively. Forecasting a particular choice
(up, down, no) is defined as the alternative with the highest probability. As to the
2 changes outside of FOMC meetings, all models would have missed them, so they
are not part of the table.

the target. In other words, this specification generates the same forecasts as a random walk
for the target, and are reported under ‘No Change.’ A second reference model that seems
useful is a random walk for the first differenced target; its forecasts are reported under
‘Same Change.’ For example, the first column of Table 6 indicates that of the 7 target-rate
increases that occurred at FOMC meetings, the ‘Same-Change’ model would have predicted
2 correctly, while it would have forecasted no move in the remaining 5 cases.
The forecasts made by the unconstrained full model vastly outperform those of the constrained one in terms of the overall percentage of correctly forecasted Fed moves (75% and
30%, respectively). The reason is that the constrained model is characterized by large prob43

abilities of nonzero moves. (This is also true for the three factor versions of the model). For
example, the constrained model is not able predict a zero target-rate move correctly. It is
worth noting, however, that the constrained model never misses the direction of the move,
leading to a perfect score in forecasting nonzero moves. In other words, conditional on a
Fed move, this model always predict the right sign of a move. The unconstrained model
produces forecasts that are also more accurate than those of the reference models in terms
of the overall correct forecasting percentage: the full model predicts 75% of the target moves
on FOMC meetings correctly, compared to only 60% using the ‘Same-Change’ model and
70% using the ‘No-Change’ model.

5.6

Model-implied Policy Rule

Policy rules are structural equations that specify the map from a set of variables to the
policy instrument of the central bank. Recursively identified VARs, for example, typically
contain one equation describing the data-generating process of the fed funds rate, that can
be interpreted as a policy rule plus some orthogonal monetary policy shock (see Christiano,
Eichenbaum and Evans (1998)). The identifying assumption that will be used here is that
the Fed reacts to the value of the state ‘just before’ the FOMC meeting. The resulting highfrequency rule of the Fed can be computed as the conditional expected value of the target
as a function of model-implied factors based on the estimated SML parameters.
For a given parameter value, the rule can be backed out by the staff using daily and
even higher frequency data. The rule thereby avoids the criticism by Orphanides (1998) who
44

argues that policy-rule plots regularly shown by the Fed staff to the FOMC at the beginning
of each meeting cannot be based on right-hand-side variables that are yet to be released.
With weekly observations, the model-implied policy rule at time t is

Eu [ θ(t) ] = 0.36 + 0.10 s(u) + 0.87 θ(u) + 7.51 v(u) + 0.0033 z(u),

(13)

where u = t − 1/52. According to this policy rule, the Fed reacts mainly to information
contained in the yield curve. This statement is still true after employment and CPI inflation
are added to the model (see Section 6). The most important variable in the rule is the inertia
variable z which was shown to be closely related to the 2-year yield (Table 5). Another
important variable in (13) is the past target, which is usually referred to as interest-rate
smoothing. While variables such as volatility v and the inertia variable z may seem unfamiliar
as arguments of a policy rule, they act as sufficient statistics for macroeconomic variables the
Fed cares about. The small spread coefficient shows that the Fed does not care much about
money-market noise which causes short-lived deviations of the short rate from the target.
Figure 6 compares the model-implied rule to the original Taylor rule and an estimated
extended Taylor rule. Both Taylor-type rules use the quarterly averaged fed funds rate as
left-hand side variable. The original Taylor rule uses the fixed coefficients proposed by Taylor
(1993) on the two right-hand side variables: π four-quarter average inflation, computed using
the GDP deflator, and the output gap y, computed as the percentage deviation of real GDP
from its trend (based on a Hodrick-Prescott filter). The extension adds the lagged fed funds

45

rate to the right-hand side.19 To mimic the decision process of the Fed, the graph plots the
policy rule for each FOMC meeting given its value in the quarter the meeting took place,
leaving us with 40 data points. By eyeballing, the model-implied rule seems to be a better
description of the actual target. This is confirmed by the mean absolute difference between
actual target and the value of the target prescribed by the policy rule. For the original Taylor
rule, the estimated Taylor (no lagged fed funds rate), the extended Taylor and the modelimplied rule, the mean absolute difference is 162, 41, 22 and 10 basis points, respectively. The
reason for the better fit of the model-implied rule is that the model-implied state variables,
especially the inertia factor, commove with changes in the state of the economy to which the
Fed reacts. This makes the inertia factor seem like it is ‘anticipating’ target moves, while
the Taylor-based rules only catch up slowly with the target.

6

Linking Policy Inertia to Macro Shocks
As the Fed reacts to macroeconomic variables (taken to be nonfarm payroll employment

and CPI inflation) when fixing its target, expectations about future macro variables matter
for current long yields. Whenever these expectations are updated, such as at macroeconomic
releases, one would expect long yields to react. This conjecture can be verified in an unrestricted regression of yield changes on ‘macro surprises’, defined as the difference between
19

The intercept of the original Taylor rule is 3, the coefficients on π and y are 1.5 and 0.5, respectively. The
estimated rules are computed using quarterly data from 1994:1 to 1998:12. In the extended Taylor rule, the
estimated constant is -0.3602, the coefficients on π, y and the lagged fed funds rate are 0.4968, 0.3411 and
0.9105 with standard errors 0.7473, 0.1907, 0.2251 and 0.0861, respectively, calculated with 2 Newey-West
lags. The R2 is 91%, which is reduced to 23% in the case of an estimated Taylor rule (without lagged fed
funds rate). The data was obtained from the Federal Reserve Database.

actual and analyst forecast. For the case of employment releases, Figure 8 shows that the
slope coefficient of this regression as a function of yield maturity has a hump at 2 years and
is significant. In the following, I explore whether the information contained in the policy
inertia factor of the yields-only model in the last section can be linked to macro shocks in a
setting that respects the exact timing of analyst forecasts and macroeconomic releases.

47

6.1

Analyst Forecasts and Actual Data

Employment and CPI releases are made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employment
releases are at 8:30 a.m. on the first Friday of each month,20 while CPI figures are released
about two weeks after the end of the reference month, also at 8:30 a.m. This means that
the LIBOR recorded at 11 a.m. London time is affected by a macro release on the preceding
day, while swap rates recorded at the end of the London business day react on the same day
as the macro release. The actual and released CPI and nonfarm payroll employment (NPE)
series are from Money Market Services (MMS). The raw series obtained from MMS are
the monthly percentage change in the CPI and changes in nonfarm payroll employment in
thousands. The CPI series is multiplied by 1200 to obtain the annualized inflation rate, and
changes in employment are divided by 100 (to obtain a series that is similar in magnitude to
CPI inflation). These series of actuals are the numbers that were released on that particular
date. MMS collects data on analyst forecasts each Friday prior to the actual release from
about 40 money-market managers and reports their median forecast. These analyst-forecast
data have been used in most studies of release surprises (for example, Balduzzi, Elton,
and Green (1998), Li and Engle (1998), Fleming and Remolona (1999)). The monthly
time series of changes in nonfarm payroll employment (NPE) and CPI inflation (CPI) for
the sample period 1994-1998 contains only 60 monthly observations. Evidence about the
macro dynamics will therefore be collected using all available data from MMS, which started
20

The relevance of this variable can, for example, be seen from the Minutes of past FOMC meetings. In
six out of eight FOMC meetings in 1996, the Board’s discussion of the “economic and financial outlook”
started with a general overview of the state of the economy and then immediately turned to the value of
nonfarm payroll employment.

6.2

Dynamics of Employment and Inflation

Over the sample period 1985:6 to 1998:12, it is not possible to outperform analyst forecasts in the mean-squared-error sense with one-step-ahead forecasts of univariate or bivariate
ARMA specifications (even conditioning on past target values). The errors of analyst forecasts are positively correlated with those of time-series models, but this correlation is far
from perfect. For instance, the sample correlation coefficient is at most 0.65 for the CPI
and 0.85 for NPE. A reason for the relatively low correlation between analyst errors and
model errors is the oversimplified informational structure assumed by the low-dimensional
time-series model. When forecasting, actual investors are able to condition on a wealth of
state variables. I thus explore a state-space model of macro variables and analyst forecasts
that introduces latent variables summarizing this conditioning information.
The first step in setting up this system is to check for the unbiasedness of analyst forecast
I
mF = (mCP
, mFN P E ) of the vector m = (mCP I , mN P E ) of CPI and NPE. I test for each
F

variable whether ci0 = 0 and ci1 = 1 when fitting

mi (t) = ci0 + ci1 miF (t) + i (t),

i = CP I, N P E,

(14)

21
The extension of the sample period to pre-1994 is justified if the precise timing of policy events (target
moves at FOMC meetings versus moves at random business days) does not matter for how policy impacts
monthly macro series, an assumption which seems to be reasonable.

where i is white noise. Unbiasedness cannot be rejected at the 1% level for NPE, but is
strongly rejected for the CPI series for the period 1985-1998. Concentrating on the post-1994
subsample, that used for the yield-curve model, CPI forecasts also “pass” the unbiasedness
test at the 1% confidence level.22 Finally, three lagged values of CPI, NPE and the target rate
were included on the right-hand side of (14), but none had a significant coefficient, except
perhaps for a weak effect of the first lagged CPI on NPE. To conclude, analyst forecasts of
CPI and NPE provide a reasonably good description of the conditional expected values of
these variables, at least in the post-1994 period, so that (14) will be used with ci0 = 0 and
ci1 = 1.
The second step in setting up the joint system for NPE and CPI is an examination of their
correlation. The contemporaneous correlation between the two variables is small (0.017).
When lagging one of these variables, the correlation estimates rarely exit approximate 95%

Balduzzi, Elton, and Green (1997) and Li and Engle (1998) conduct this test with a short history as
well, and fail to reject the null.

confidence bounds around zero, as can be seen from Figure 7. Granger causation regressions
(not reported here) in fact show that NPE does not help much in predicting future CPI. The
CPI might, however, help in forecasting NPE. Including lagged values of the CPI in an AR(3)
specification, for example, of NPE leads to a small gain in adjusted R 2 (9.5% to 12.1%). For
each of CPI and NPE, we therefore specify conditionally independent subsystems, using the
target rate as an exogenous variable.
The final requirements of the state-space system are that the macro variables are part
of the state, and that the state is a four-dimensional autoregressive process of order 1 (this
last choice will be further discussed below).
In the continuous-time economy, one deterministic counting process N i records macroeconomic releases and another, NFi , counts the times at which analyst forecasts are made.
Selecting a release time τ i and the succeeding analyst forecast time τFi , the specification can
be summarized as:

mi (τ i ) = miF (τ i ) + i (τ i )

(15)

miF (τFi ) = ai0 + ai1 miF (τFi −) + ai2 mi (τFi −) + ai3 θ(τFi −) + jF (τFi ),

where i (τ i ) and iF (τFi ) are jointly Gaussian independent across time with mean zero, rei
spective variances σ i and σFi , and covariance σmF
.23
23

Fore more intuition, consider the problem of modeling mF and m in discrete time. Let the state be
denoted by z = (z CP I , z N P E ) with z i ∈ R2 , i = CP I, N P E. Leaving out the dependence on the target for
the moment, the observation equations in the state space system are (1) miF (t + 1) = α0 + α1 z1i (t) + α2 z2i (t)

51

Maximum-likelihood parameter estimates for (15) are reported in Table 7, except for
i
the covariance parameter σmF
, which was estimated to be zero for both CPI and NPE.
I
The forecast mF of m does not depend on the past value of m (both aCP
and a2N P E are
2
I
small and insignificant), and depend only slightly on the past target (aCP
is somewhat
3

larger than a3N P E , but neither is significant). The impulse reponse of a macro variable to
a release surprise (τ ) at time τ thus dies off after one month, since the surprise does not
affect future released values. In this sense, release surprises are only temporary components
of macro variables. Based on (15), mCP I and mN P E are both treated as the sum of an
AR(1), the forecast mF , and Gaussian white noise. In other words, this specification results
in an ARMA(1,1)-structure, which is also the specification selected by comparing Akaike
and Schwarz criteria of ARMA(p,q) models that include p lagged values of the target rate.
The restrictiveness of a four-dimensional state can be checked by including additional lagged
values of mF and m in the equation determining analyst forecasts. I do not find additional
significant terms for the CPI forecasts, but an additional moving average for NPE forecasts
improves the model-selection criteria.
and (2) mi (t) = α0 + z1i (t). This shows that z2 is the latent state that summarizes the information used by
investors toform the forecast mF . The state equation is z i (t) = Ai z i (t − 1) + u(t) with u(t) ∼ N(0, Ωi ), Ai =

. This system is the maximally flexible system that imposes that (i) miF (t) is the conditional
αi1 αi2
mean of mi (t), (ii) independence between CPI and NPE, (iii) mi is part of the state z i , and (iv) z i is an
AR(1). This is equivalent to (15).

6.3

Model-Implied Response to Release Surprises

The state vector X is now augmented by (m(t), mF (t)), of which only m(t) enters the
stochastic intensities (2). If an FOMC meeting and a macro jump event happen on the same
day, the Fed’s target decisions are able to condition on the newly released information, as
CPI and NPE releases (at 8:30 a.m.) precede FOMC meetings. The approximation of the
likelihood function is derived in Appendix C.3. The estimation uses 1, 3, 6, and 12-month
LIBOR rates, the target rate, CPI, NPE, and analyst forecasts. In addition to the weekly
observations from Section 5, the day of and preceding CPI and NPE releases are included
into the sample. Both daily data and longer maturities would raise the computational burden
significantly, as was discussed in Section 4.4.
The impact of the surprise m(τ ) − mF (τ ) of a macroeconomic release at time τ on
yields is determined by how it affects the arrival intensity of policy moves. The surprise can
affect future Fed behavior in two ways. First, it could in principle change investors’ forecast
about future macro variables the Fed reacts to following λCP I and λN P E in (2). Surprises
are, however, only temporary components of macro variables: they do not affect the future
path of macro variables. Release surprises therefore have a ‘short life’, which means that
53

they cannot affect macro variables that are relevant for FOMC meetings that are scheduled
beyond the next macroeconomic release. Second, the surprise can affect the probability of a
target change at the next FOMC meeting, which then changes future intensities according
to λθ in (2). The estimation results (not reported here) show that this latter effect is not
important, so that the estimated λCP I and λN P E are not significant.
This can also be seen from Figure 8 which plots the cross-sectional response of yields to a
one-standard deviation release surprise to NPE. In the model, release surprises do not have
hump-shaped coefficients like in the unrestricted regressions, but they are monotonically
decreasing with maturity. This shows that release surprises are not ‘inertia factors’ like z.
By introducing, for example, a jump in the inertia factor z at employment releases that is
correlated with the actual surprise, the surprise may ‘live longer,’ as a shock to z affects
intensities in the farer future.

Figure 8: The first graph shows the slope parameter of daily yield changes regressed on NPE standardized
surprises (and an intercept) using the subsample of the respective release days. Dotted lines are standarderror bounds computed with 5 Newey-West lags. Standardized surprises are defined as the analyst forecast
error m(t)−mF (t), normalized by its standard deviation, so that the regression coefficients can be interpreted
as reactions to a one-standard deviation analyst forecast error. The second graph shows the model-implied
instantaneous response of yields to NPE release surprises. Due to time-zone differences, the data used for
this estimation are same-day observations from 1994 to 1998 on 2, 3, 4, 5-year swap rates, and next-day
observations of 1, 3, 6 and 12-month LIBOR rates.

A

Linear-Quadratic Jump-Diffusions
Fix a complete probability space (Ω, F , P) and a filtration {F (t) : t ≥ 0} satisfying the

usual conditions (Protter (1990)). Linear-quadratic jump-diffusions (LQJDs) are defined by
choosing particular functional forms for the coefficients µ and σ of the SDE

dX(t) = µ(X(t), t) dt + σ(X(t, t)) dW (t) + dJ(t),

where W is a vector of Brownian motions, together with additional restrictions on the jump
process J. In describing these parametric specifications, I can, without loss of generality,
partition the state as X = (X1 , X2 ) so that X2 is a k2 -dimensional process, with k1 +k2 = N .
Assumption 1 will restrict X2 to be Gauss-Markov. It will be convenient to define the set

C = {(c0 , c1 , c2 ) ∈ R × RN × RN ×N : c2 is symmetric positive semidefinite
and consists of zeros except possibly the lower right k2 × k2 partition}

of coefficients. I will make repeated use of LQ functions of the state of the form g : D × C →
R, with

g(x, c) = c0 + c1 x + x> c2 x.

64

(A.1)

I am now in the position to specify the LQJD as follows.
Assumption 1 (Characterization of LQJD processes)
(a) (Functional Form of Drift and Volatility)
The drift and ‘volatility’ of X are given by are given by

µ(x, t) = K(t) (x̄(t) − x)

(A.2)

σ(x, t) = Σ(t) S(x, t),

(A.3)

where S(x, t) is a N × N diagonal matrix with i-th diagonal element [S(x, t)]i,i =

p

s0i (t) + s1i (t) · x, and where the coefficients s0i (t) ∈ R, s1i (t), x̄ ∈ RN and K(t), Σ(t) ∈

RN ×N are deterministic functions of time.

(b) (Functional Form of Stochastic Intensities)
The jumps J are counted by a p-dimensional counting process Np with stochastic
intensity, and by a d-dimensional deterministic counting process Nd with no common
jump times.24 The stochastic intensity {λi (t) : t ≥ 0} of Npi is given by

λi (t) = g X(t−), li (t) ,

(A.4)

for time-dependent coefficients li (t) ∈ C. The coefficients li (t) and the domain D
satisfy joint conditions to ensure that λi (t) ≥ 0, as required for any intensity process.
24

This means that ∆Npi · ∆Npj = 0 and ∆Ndi · ∆Ndj = 0, i 6= j almost surely.

65

(c) (Conditional Jump-Size Distributions)
For any Poisson jump time τ , the F (τ −)-conditional distribution vp,τ of the jump
size ∆X(τ ) is independent of X(τ −). For any deterministic jump time t, the F (t−)conditional distribution vd,t of the jump size ∆X(t) has a Laplace transform which is
an exponential LQ function of X(t−). More precisely, for all a ∈ RN , I have that

Et− [exp(a · ∆X(t))] = exp (g (X(t−), c(t; a)))

(A.5)

for some c(t; a) ∈ C.
(d) (Parameter Restrictions)

(i) All of the time-dependent coefficients are bounded and piece-wise constant functions of time.25
(ii) Joint restrictions on (µ, σ, J) and the domain D apply that guarantee a unique
(strong) solution to (4).
(iii) Gaussianity of X2 : The lower left k2 × k1 partitions of the matrices K(t) and
Σ(t), labeled K21 (t) and Σ21 (t), consist of zeros only. Also, s1i (t) is an N -vector
of zeros for all i ∈ {k1 + 1, . . . , N }. Finally, the lower k2 entries of J are always
zero (X2 does not jump).
25

This particular type of time-dependence of the parameters determining the dynamics of X is sufficient
for the seasonality effects studied this paper. Alternatively, the parameters may be bounded continuous
functions of time.

66

B

Linear-Quadratic Yield-Curve Model
In the specification estimated in this paper, the short rate r is taken to be the sum of

two state variables, the spread and the target. More generally, the affine structure of Duffie
and Kan (1996) and the quadratic structure of the SAINTS model Constantinides (1992),
El Karoui, Myneni, and Viswanathan (1993) can be combined by the following assumption.

Assumption 2 (Linear-Quadratic Short Rate of Interest)
Fixing a linear-quadratic jump diffusion X, the short-rate process {r(t); t ≥ 0} is assumed
to have the linear-quadratic form R(x, t) = g(x, δ(t)) for some given coefficients δ(t) ∈ C.

B.1

Statement of Lemma 1

Let the times at which deterministic jumps occur between t and T be denoted τ1d , . . . , τnd .
In the following, Assumption 1 will often be assumed to hold under the risk-neutral probability measure Q. This will be taken to mean that (A.2), (A.3) and (A.4) define the coefficients
of the dynamics of the state (4) under Q, and (A.5) will hold with the expectation taken
under Q.
Lemma 1:

Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold under Q. Additionally, for t = τid ,

for some i, suppose that P (t, T ) = exp (g (X(t), c̄ )) and for some c̄ = (c̄0 , c̄1 , c̄2 ) ∈ C. Then
there exist coefficients c ∈ C such that P (t−, T ) = lims↑t P (s, T ) is given by

P (t−, T ) = exp (g (X(t−), c )) .
67

(B.6)

Proof:

From equation (6),

Q
P (t−, T ) = Et−
[P (t, T )]
Q
= Et−
[exp (g (X(t), c̄ ))]
Q
= exp (g (X(t−), c̄ )) Et−
[exp (c̄1 · ∆X(t))]

= exp (g (X(t−), c̄ )) exp (g (X(t−), a(t; c̄1 )))
= exp (g (X(t−), c̄ + a(t; c̄1 ))) ,

Q
where Et−
denotes F (t−)-conditional expectation under Q, and the fourth equality holds

for some a(t; c̄1 ) ∈ C because of Definition (A1.c.). 

B.2

Statement of Lemma 2

Lemma 2:

d
Suppose that, for some i such that s = τi+1
, P (s−, T ) = limt↑s P (t, T ) can

be represented as P (s−, T ) = exp (g (X(s−), c̄ )) for some c̄ ∈ C. Let Assumptions 1 and 2
be satisfied under Q. Also suppose that the integrability conditions hold at (s, c̄), as defined
below. Then for each t ∈ [τid , s), there exist coefficients c(t, s) ∈ C such that

P (t, T ) = exp (g (X(t), c(t, s) )) ,

68

(B.7)

where c( · , s) : [τid , s] → C solves the system of ordinary differential equations (ODE’s) in
(B.11)-(B.13) stated below, with terminal condition c(s, s) = c̄.
Proof:

Lemma 2 applies the standard Feynman-Kac approach to equation (6) between

deterministic jump times. The approach proceeds in two steps. Step 1 states and solves the
relevant Cauchy problem. Step 2 imposes integrability conditions so that the bond price at
time t ∈ [τid , s) can indeed be viewed as the Feynman-Kac solution to the Cauchy problem
of Step 1.
Step 1 of Proof:

Consider the following Cauchy problem. For all t ∈ [τid , s) and

x ∈ D, let F (t, s, x) solve the partial differential-integral equation (PDIE)

0 = Ft (t, s, x) + Fx (t, s, x) · µ(x, t)

with terminal condition F (s, s, x) = exp (g (x, c̄)). Here, the notation “E Q [Jip (t)]” stands for
the unconditional mean of the distribution of the jump ∆X(t) in the state at an arbitrary
jump time τip of Nip . Because this jump is of a distribution independent of X(t−), and
because the number of jumps during any time interval is finite almost surely, the expectation
is unambigeous, despite the abuse of notation. Guess a solution of the form

F (t, s, x) = exp (g (x, c(t, s))) ,

(B.9)

where the coefficients c(t, s) = (c0 (t, s), c1 (t, s), c2 (t, s)) satisfy terminal conditions at s given
by c̄ = (c̄0 , c̄1 , c̄2 ). Now I verify that the guess in (B.9) solves the PDIE (B.8) for all t ∈ [ti , s).
By applying Ito’s Lemma to (B.9) and using the fact that F (t, s, x) is strictly positive, I have

Statement of Proposition 1

Proposition 1:

Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold under Q. Let the coefficient

vector c (t, T ) be calculated recursively using the algorithm shown in Appendix B.4. Assume
that the integrability conditions hold at (τid , c(τid , T )), i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, and also at (T, 0).
Then P (t, T ) = ψ (X (t) , c(t, T )) for all t ≤ T .

Proof:

The proof is by induction over the deterministic jump dates τ1d , . . . , τnd be-

tween t and T . By assumption, P (T, T ) = 1. Applying Lemma 2 with s = T, c̄ = 0
and ψ(X(T ), c̄) = 1, implies that P (t, T ) satisfies (7) for t ∈ [τnd , T ). Lemma 1 can then be
applied to obtain the desired property for P (τnd −, T ). Now suppose, for any deterministic
d
jump time τid , that P (τi+1
−, T ) is given by (7). Lemma 2 can be applied to establish the
d
desired property for any time t ∈ [τid , τi+1
) and then Lemma 1 to get it for P (τid −, T ). By

73

induction, P (t, T ), t ∈ [0, T ], has the desired property. (Note that Lemma 2 can also be
applied to the interval [0, τ1d )).

B.4

Recursive Calculation of c(t, T )

The algorithm for computing c(t, T ) is provided here.

Step 0 (Initialization):
The terminal condition for c(t, T ) at T consists of a collection of zeros denoted by c̄n+1 in
C. Let c̃n (t, T ) solve the ODE’s in (B.11)-(B.13) during the interval [τnd , T ] with terminal
d
condition c̄n+1 , and define τn+1
= T.

Go to Step 1.

(B.13) during the interval [τn−i

Stop if i = n. Go to Step i + 1.

The coefficients c(t, T ) are then equal to c̃i (t, T ) for any t ∈ (τid , τi+1

t = τid .

Simulated Maximum Likelihood with Jumps

C.1

SML without Macro Variables

Suppose X contains the target rate θ, modeled as the (observable) difference of the
“up” and “down” counting processes, with state-and time-dependent intensities as in (1). I
abstract for the moment from the time dependence of stochastic intensities introduced by
FOMC meetings, assuming that these intensities are always “active.” Starting from x̃ at
time t̃, X can be simulated with the scheme

x̃
∆X̂tx̃ = µ(X̂t−h
, t − h) h +

√

X̂t̃x̃ = x̃,

75

x̃
h σ(X̂t−h

(C.15)

where t is i.i.d. standard normal and J X is the deterministic jump27 in X at random times,
determined by a 2-dimensional vector of Bernoulli variables zt that determine jumps, up
and down. Using the conditional independence of the counting processes N U and N D , and
assuming that the econometrician observes only the difference of the two, the simulation rolls
a “three-sided die” to determine zt . The three sides are “up” (“U”, meaning θt − θt−h = Jθ ),
“down” (“D”, meaning θt − θt−h = −Jθ ), and “no change” (“0”, meaning θt = θt−h ). Their
conditional probabilities at time t are approximately

I now turn to a case with time-dependent intensities that is relevant in Section 3. In that
application, policy interventions on meeting days are modeled by activating state-dependent
Poisson intensities only during FOMC meeting days. More precisely, suppose the i-th meeting day is during the interval [t̃M (i), tM (i)]. It is straightforward to modify the simulation
scheme (C.15) to allow jumps only during such meeting-day intervals. The s-th path drawn
from this modified scheme is referred to in what follows as X̂tx̃ [s]. I now construct analogues of (C.16) for this time-dependent case. As long as the observation time t lies within a
meeting-day interval, in that t̃M (i) ≤ t < tM (i), the approximation (C.16) itself still applies.
If the observation time t is made outside an FOMC meeting, however, then one might want
to replace the Bernoulli-density terms with an indicator function for sample paths leading
up to the actual value of the target at t,

(C.17)

In (C.17), jumps in the target enter the SML objective function only through the indicator
x̃
function and the simulated values X̂t−h
. This creates a serious problem when maximizing

the objective: For a given (finite) number S of simulations, a small change in the parameter
vector does not necessarily affect the average number of jumps across simulations and may
thus leave the value of the likelihood function unchanged. Only changes in a parameter that
77

are large enough to affect the number of simulated jumps change the objective function,
but possibly by a large amount.28 In order to overcome this discontinuity, an alternative to
(C.17) is constructed as follows. The joint conditional density of factors can be written in

where S̄ denotes the total number of simulated paths that resulted in the observed value

(starting with x̃ = Xt̃ ), while the expression in the first row weights the simulated paths by
their likelihoods. In practice, with time-dependent intensities h must be chosen carefully, as
intensities can become large during an FOMC meeting. Details about the choice of h can

A similar issue is encountered by Anderson, Benzoni, and Lund (1999) who estimate a jump-diffusion
model for equity returns with EMM. In their specification, the size of the jump is Gaussian and the occurrence
of jumps is not observed, so that they smooth the mapping from parameters to the estimation’s objective
function by allowing for partial jumps. In the setup considered in this paper, the target only moves in
observable 25 basis points increments, so that a simulation of partial jumps is not feasible. A conjecture
is that the method proposed in the following can also be applied with EMM, since the efficiency results of
Gallant and Tauchen (1996) do not rely on a particular leading density.

Variance-reduction techniques can improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo integration
(see Geweke (1996)). Here, antithetic variates are used in simulating the paths of the state
vector. That is, with each new pseudo-random Gaussian [s] and uniform u[s], the antithetic
variates −[s] and 1 − u[s] are used as a subsequent scenario.

Simulation of the Target

The highest value that is reached by the intensities λU and λD in a typical estimated
model29 is 1225. At this value, the next Figure shows that a Bernoulli approximation that
allows for only one jump during an FOMC meeting is not accurate. The Bernoulli density for
h=

1
365

overstates the true probability of one jump. If the number of Bernoulli trials during

an FOMC meeting is increased so that h ≥

1 1
,
30 365

the Bernoulli approximation becomes

accurate. To economize on the number of simulated steps (and thereby the computation time
for the likelihood evaluation), the FOMC meeting day is divided into Ms + 1 intervals, where
Ms is a number divisable by 5. During 5 subintervals [ti , ti+1 ] of length h =

SML with Macro Variables

The state vector X is now augmented with the macro-related information M (t) =
(m(t), mF (t)), and X (θ,M ) denotes the vector consisting of all coordinates of the state X
except θ and M . Analogous to the decomposition (C.18), I can write the density of X

80

conditional on the last observation Xt̃ = x in the form

(θ,M )

fX (Xt , t | x, t̃) = fθ,M (θt , Mt , t | x, t̃)fX (θ,M ) |θ,M (Xt

, t | θt , Mt , x, t̃).

(C.19)

The first term in (C.19) can be written as

fθ,M (θt , Mt , t | x, t̃) = fM (Mt , t | x, t̃)fθ (θt , t|x, Mt , t̃).

If an FOMC meeting and a macro jump event happen on the same day, the Fed’s target
decisions are able to condition on the newly released information, as CPI and NPE releases
(at 8:30 a.m.) precede FOMC meetings. Since each observation interval [t̃, t] is chosen so
that it does not contain more than one FOMC meeting, the density of M conditional on
X(t̃) depends only on θ(t̃). Moreover, [t̃, t] is short enough so as to not contain the release
of the current month’s macro variable together with the analyst survey of forecasts for the
next month. For the i-th macroeconomic release, I therefore have
