    "abstract": "\n\nSince the mid-1980s, the share of household net worth intermediated by US \ufb01nancial institutions has shifted from de\ufb01ned bene\ufb01t plans to life insurers and de\ufb01ned contribution plans. Life insurers have primarily grown through variable annuities, which are mutual funds with longevity insurance, a potential tax advantage, and minimum return guarantees. The minimum return guarantees change the primary function of life insurers from traditional insurance to \ufb01nancial engineering. Variable annuity insurers are exposed to interest and equity risk mismatch and their stock returns were especially low during the COVID-19 crisis. We consider regulatory changes, such as more detailed \ufb01nancial disclosure and standardized stress tests, to monitor potential risk mismatch and to ensure stability of the insurance sector.\n\n",
