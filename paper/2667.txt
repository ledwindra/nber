A NOTE ON REVENUE FORECASTING
DURING THE DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATIONS
ABSTRACT

Critics

of Governor Michael Dukakis have suggested that this

year's $400 million overestimate of tax revenues in Massachusetts
casts doubt on his putative managerial skills. In this paper, we
carefully examine the entire Dukakis forecasting record. We find
that the 1988 experience was "unusual" in the sense that on

average, revenue forecasts produced by his administration have
been too low rather than too high.

In addition, we find that

there is no significant difference between the quality of the
Dukakis forecasts and those of his predecessors in Massachusetts.

Hence, those who seek to discover anything extraordinarily
positive or negative about Dukakis' managerial capabilities
should shift their attention to skills other than revenue
forecast ing.

tntroductiOfl

CustomarilY, discussions of state revenue forecasting are
consigned to the pages of journals on government administration.
In recent months, however, the problems caused by large
underestimates of revenues in California, Massachusetts and New
York have received substantial publicity in the national press.
The situation in Massachusetts has received particular attention
due to the Presidential aspirations of Governor Michael Dukakis.
The Dukakis campaign has emphasized his superb managerial skills.
Critics of Dukakis argue that the revenue shortfall

in

Massachusetts is evidence that these skills are not all that they

are cracked up to be. For example, after the magnitude of the
revenue shortfall became public, The Wall Street Journal
approvingly quoted a Massachusetts official who said, "The
Massachusetts Miracle is starting to sound like the last days of
Pompeii. "1

While we do not believe that good revenue forecasting is
a

necessarily

the sine qua non for good administration, neither is

it a trivial matter. After all, sensible deliberations about
expenditures cannot be made in the absence of "good" forecasts.
Indeed, in the presence of constitutional or statutory provisions
for balanced budgets, unanticipated changes in revenues can wreak
havoc not only on projects that are scheduled for funding, but on
plans that have already been put into effect as well. Hence, we

believe that an evaluation of an administration's forecasting

ability plays an important role in assessing its overall
compe t ence.

The first thing to realize when conducting such an
evaluation is that state revenue forecasters operate Lfl

an

environment characterized by great uncertainty. Future revenues
generated by a given revenue structure depend on future values of
variables like employment, population, and nominal income,
none
of which is easy to predict.
Additional uncertainty is created
since the state tax structure itself may be changed in the

future. Such changes depend in part on the political climate in
the state, another thing that is hard to predict. Operating
in
such an environment, forecasters cannot be expected to obtain
precisely correct answers.

Related to this point is the observation that it is not
sensible to evaluate an administration solely on the basis of any

given year's outcome. Due to random fluctuations any particular
forecast may be quite "bad," and this is not necessarily the
"fault" of the administration.

Indeed, extraordinary

fluctuations in certain variables may make forecasting
intrinsically more difficult in some periods than others; one

should try to take such fluctuations into account in
evaluating
forecasts.
This paper uses such an approach to evaluate the forecasting
record of the Dukakjs administration.
issues are described in Section II.

The relevant institutional
Section III discusses the

data and results. We find that overall, there is not much to

distinguish the Dukakis forecasting record from that of other

Massachusetts governors. That is, on average, his forecast
errors do not differ significantly from those of his

predecessors. Section tV concludes with a summary.

tnstitutional Background

The last week of every January the Governor of Massachusetts
submits to the legislature a budget statement that includes

forecasts of revenues and expenditures. The forecast for each
item is made over two time horizons. The first, which we call
the short forecast, is for the fiscal year that began the
previous July 1.

The second, which we call the long forecast, is

for the fiscal year beginning the subsequent July 1. Hence, the
short forecast presented in January 1988 covers the period July
1, 1987 to June 30, 1988; the long forecast contained in that
message is for July 1, 1988 to June 30, 1989.
In most states, forecasts are made by a budget division
within the executive branch (Hyde and Jarocki E1983, p. 266].

The final responsibility lies with the governor, who reviews the
forecasts, and can modify them before presentation.

Massachusetts is typical in these respects. The forecasting
process begins in the October preceding the budget address, and a
set of figures is produced by the Bureau of Administration and

Finance (BA&F) in November. However, these figures are usually
revised once or twice before the budget message goes to press in
January.

Revenue forecasting methods differ widely across the states.
3

Some states rely on econometric models, others on much more
informal methods.

En Massachusetts, formal econometric modelling

plays a greater role than it does in many other states. The BA&F
receives econometric forecasts for Massachusetts generated by a

consulting firm Data Resources, Inc.), and then plugs these
forecasts into a micro simulation model based on Massachusetts

tax returns. However, all forecasts are subject to the judgment
of "old hands," and some revenue sources are forecast without any
formal modelling at all.

ttl. Evaluating The Revenue Forecasts

Table 1 shows total tax revenues during each year Dukakis
was governor, along with the corresponding short and long

forecasts. Thus, for example, reading the row for the year 1987
indicates that in January 1986, Dukakis predicted that the

revenues for fiscal 1987 would be $7.88 billion; in January 1987
he revised this estimate down to $7.73 billion, and actual tax
revenues were $8.10

ilion. The 1988 fiasco is represented by

the fact that the short forecast of $8.64 billion exceeded actual

revenues of $8.24 billion, a shortfall of $400 million. Jote,
however, that such over—optimistic predictions of revenues are

not the rule. For the four years preceding 1988, both the short
and long forecasts were less than actual tax revenues.

Because the level of nominal tax revenues quadrupled between
1975 and 1988, comparisons across time are facilitated by

computing the forecast errors for each year as a proportion of

total revenues. This is done in Table 2. The quality of the
4

short forecasts appears to have deteriorated over time in the
sense that the absolute values of the proportional forecast

errors have increased. tnterestingly, the absolute value of the
proportional overestimate of 1988 revenue was about the same

magnitude as that of the underestimates for 1986 and 1987. Then
why was there so much more fuss about the 1988 error than its two

predecessors? One obvious answer is the increased prominence of
Governor Dukakis in national politics. However, this also
appears to be a manifestation of a more general phenomenon ——

politicians

and journalists appear to regard over-optimistic

revenue forecasts as being worse than over—pessimistic ones.
(See Feenberg, et al. (1988].)

In any case, as we emphasized in the previous section1 a
given set of revenue forecasts cannot be analyzed in a vacuum.
We do not know whether the figures in Table 2 are "good" or "bade'

without some basis for comparison. One possibility is to compare
the Dukakis forecasting record to that of other Massachusetts

governors. This is done in Table 3.

The first column shows

statistics relating to the Dukakis administrations; the second

column relates to all other governors since 1953. The first row
It indicates that during the

in the column is for reference.

Dukakis years1 actual tax revenues grew at 12.1 percent annually.,

a bit higher than the 11.5 percent rate during other

administrations. The second and third rows refer to the errors
in the predictions of proportional revenue growth. Specifically,
let Rt be the actual proportional change in nominal revenues in
5

year t, and Ft be the forecast of Rt .

mean value of Rt -

Ft.

The second row shows the

The positive value of both of the mean

errors in row 2 indicates that on average, both Dukakis and other
Massachusetts governors tended to underestimate revenue growth.
The Dukakis short forecasts have been somewhat more optimistic
than those of other Massachusetts governors in the sense that

their mean value is closer to zero. On the other hand, Dukakis'
long forecasts have been more pessimistic.

Of course, a lower mean value might be associated with a

regime in which the forecasting is done verypoorly, but large
positive and negative errors happen to cancel each other out.

To

investigate this possibility, we also computed the mean absolute

value of the forecast error. (See row 3.) For the short
forecasts, the mean absolute value of Rt — Ft is essentially the

same for Dukakis and other Massachusetts governors. For the long
forecasts, Dukakis has been more accurate in the sense that the
mean absolute error is smaller, but the difference is not
statistically significant.

tnterpretatjon of the figures in Table 3 is complicated by
the fact that the underlying difficulty of making revenue

forecasts may vary from year to year. Suppose, for example, that
income growth during the Dukakis administrations was less

volatile than during other administrations. Then in a sense it
was "easier" to forecast during his administrations, and the fact

that the proportional errors in his long forecasts were smaller

should not be attributed to any special forecasting skill. On
6

I

the other hand, perhaps the economic environment he faced was
more volatile than others, in which case the figures in Table 3
do not do justice to his forecasting ability.

rn order to investigate these possibilities, we estimated
two regressions of the form:

random error.

The rationale behind this specification is that the squared
forecast error is a function of innovations in variables like
income, and the innovation in a particular variable can be

measured by the difference between its actual rate of growth and
its trend rate of growth.

(The exception is TAXt, the "surprise"

in tax revenues due to legislative modification of the governor's

tax program. TAXt is equal to zero if the legislature does as
requested by the governor; otherwise, it is the change in

revenues attributable to the difference.) By including the
squared innovations on the right hand side of a regression with
(Rt —

Ft)2 as a dependent variable, we are in effect controlling

for other factors that might affect forecast errors. Thus, the
coefficient on the dichotomous variable DUKE indicates whether
the Dukakis forecasts were better or worse, holding constant the

volatility of the forecasting environment. Of course, there is
some arbitrariness in selecting a set of variables to control for
volatility, and in determining whether they should be entered

with lags and/or interacted with each other. However, the
substantive results presented below were unaffected by various
changes in specification.

The regression results are presented in Table 4.

Let us

first consider the coefficient on the variable of primary
importance, DUKE.

For both the long and short forecasts, the

coefficients are statistically not significantly different from

zero. We conclude that revenue forecast errors during the
8

[)ukakis years were about the same as those of other Massachusetts

governors. Turning now to the other variables in Table 4, the
coefficients are generally insignificant, except for TAXt.
Apparently, uncertainty about the outcome of the legislative

process is a more important explanation for forecast errors than
volatility in the economic environment.

tV. Conclusion
We have examined data on Massachusetts tax revenue forecasts

during the Dukakis administrations in Massachusetts. Our main
findings are as follows:1.

Despite the well-publicized shortfall in revenues in

l9, (luring most years, Dukakis' revenue forecasts
have generally been less than actual revenues.
2.

The average growth rate of nominal tax revenues during
the Dukakis years was about the same as during the

administration of other Massachusetts governors since
1953.
3.

On average, both Dukakis and other Massachusetts
governors have underestimated the rate of tax revenue
growth.

4.

Once we control for factors that might affect the
difficulty of making revenue forecasts, there is no
statistically significant difference between the
Dukakis record of revenue forecasting and that of other
Massachusetts governors.

tn short, the 1988 shortfall in revenues is not part of a
9

pattern of terribly incompetent forecasting. On the other hand,

there

is nothing that makes Dukakis' record as a revenue

forecaster stand out against that of his predecessors. Hence,
those who seek to discover anything extraordinarily positive or
negative about Dukakis' managerial capabilities should shift
their attention to skills other than revenue forecasting.
