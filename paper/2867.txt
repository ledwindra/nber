IT"TRODUCTION
The history of foreign lending in the 19th and 20th centuries offers a rich lode of
evidence on the operation of international capital markets. The last hundred years have
been punctuated by a series of crises -- in the 1870s, 1890s and 1930s to cite three
instances -- bearing a striking resemblanceto the debt crisis of the 1980s. For the
historian, that experience provides an exceptional opportunity to study the long-term
evolution

of international markets and their adaptation to repeated shocks. For the

economist, it provides an opportunity to reflect on how the current debt crisis may be
resolved. It is not possible to extrapolate directly from historical experience, since
institutionalaspects of the lending process, including the relative importance of bank and
bond finance, the rise of supranational agencies such as the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, and the role of creditor-country governments in
rescheduling, have changed fundamentally over the past century. But even though the

extent of institutionalvariation renders naive the hope that one might be able to draw
simple 'lessons from the past,'

it still offers the only evidence we have on the efficiency

and distributional effects of different approaches to organizing international
lending and

readjusting existing debts.
In a series

of papers we have examinedthe interwar debt crisis from this

perspectivejJ Our analysis has spanned the lending of the 1920s, the defaults of the
1930s, and the debt readjustments

extends the main conclusions
nine major findings.

i

of the 1940s and 1950s. This paper summarizesand

that

research. The discussion will be organized around

I. Interwar investors exhibited sophistication and foresight at the lending stage. Our
analysis suggests that the past repaymentrecord

of a country, its current political

circumstances and its economic policies all figured in the deteimination

of the risk

premia on foreign bonds floated in the 1920s. There is little evidence that capital
markets have grown more sophisticated over time,

or that banks have a comparative

advantage in processing the relevant information. To the contrary, the bond market's

response to borrower characteristicsduring the 1920s bears a remarkable resemblanceto
experience during the post-1970era of bank finance,
2. Neither monocausalexplanations, nor for that matter multivariate explanations limited
to economic variables, suffice to explain the incidence and extent of default. While

authors such as Diaz-Alejandro (1983) and Fishlow (1985) have pointed rightly to the
magnitude of the external shock, proxied typicallyby the extent of terms-of-trade
deterioration, as a leading indicator of default, our own work reveals the importance of
other economic variables, including the burden

of the debt and the nature of the domestic

policy response, as well as noneconomic variables, such as proximity to a major military

power and internationalpolitical links,
3. The implications of different debt-management strategies

for subsequent

macroeconomic performanceremain difficult to isolate. In the 1930s as in the 1980s,

efforts to maintain debt service tended to be associated with fiscal austerity, import
compression and export subsidies, while the decision to suspend payments was often
accompanied by fiscal expansion, monetary reflation and policies of import-substituting
industrialization.

This wholesale reorientation of a country's macroeconomic stance

renders problematic any attempt to pick out the effects of external-debt management

2

from

the entire constellation of policies. The accumulation of evidence points

nonetheless to the conclusion that countries which interrupted service on their external
debts recovered more quickly from the Great Depression than did countries which
resisted default. This contrasts with the experience of the 1980s, for which it is even
more difficult to discern a relationship between different debt-management strategies and
subsequent macroeconomic performance.
4. There is little evidence that countries which defaulted in the 1930s incurred a cost

in

terms of inferior capital market access after World War II. Following the conclusion of
negotiated settlements with the creditors, countries which previously had suspended

interest payments and amortization were offered virtually identical access to the capital
market as were countries which had maintaineddebt service without internlption This is

not to suggest that default was without costs us terms of market access, only that those
costs were not borne differentially by countries which interrupted service on their debts
once they reached settlement agreements with the creditors. Many of the costs were
external to the defaulting countries: neither defaulting nor nondefaulting debtors had
significant access to portfolio capital in the decades immediately following World War II.
5. The readjustment of defaulted debts entailed a protracted process

of negotiation. The

analogy with Chapter 11 corporate bankruptcy proceedings,in which default and
readjustment permit a clean break with the past, is no more applicable to the 1930s than
to the 1980s. In many cases, interruptions to debt service were only sporadic, and
uncertainty over the magnitude of transfers lingered for decades.
6. In contrast to the experience of the 1980s, interwar default in some cases led to

a

substantial reduction of transfers from debtor to creditor. What we might call selective
3

debt relief' was, however, compatible with a reasonable overall rate of return to the
creditors. The risk premia charged ex ante sufficed to elevate the average realized rate

of return on sovereignloans above the yields on British and U.S. Treasury bonds.
Losses to creditors on provincial, municipal and corporate loans, although more
extensive, were still sufficient to yield positive ex post returns to British investors.

7. Notwithstandingthe contrast conventionally drawn between the extent of government
involvement in debt negotiationsin the 1930s and the 1980s, creditor-country govern-

ments often were intimately involved in the readjustment of interwar debts. The
difference between the 1930s and 1980s lies not in the extent of governmentintervention
but in its direction. In recent years creditor-country governments have exerted
conthuous pressure on the debtors to maintain service on their external debts. In the
1930s and 1940s creditor-country governments pressured debtors and creditors alike.
8. Global schemes to short-circuitthe protracted process of bilateral negotiation proved
in the 1980s -- a special
unavailing. Nearly every element of the global plans proposed

international lending facility, matched injections of private and public funds, conversion

of existing assets into new ones featuringdifferent contingencies --

was first

suggested in

the 1930s. Ultimately, those global schemes foundered on the issues of who should fund
and control their administration. The failure of the global plans offered in the 1930s
does not leave one optimistic about their prospects in the 1990s.
9. Unlike global plans, market-baseddebt reduction made a useful contribution to

resolving the debt crisis of the l930s by reducing the debt overhang and eliminating
marginal creditors.

There is little systematic evidence that debt buybacks had a

significant impact on secondary market prices, whose movement seems to have been
4

influenced primarily by changes in the prospects for a negotiated settlement. In contrast
to their public statements of disapproval, creditor organizationswere willing in private to
entertain buybacks out of reserves as part of the readjustmentprocess.
1. The Lending Stage

The international capital markets in the 1920s are accused of having engaged in all
manner of excesses. The issue houses pushed questionable obligations on hesitant
borrowers and questionable bonds on otherwisecautious investors./ New entrants into
the supply side of the market -- large New York banks which foresaw a series

of lean

years in wholesale and industrial banking, and jumped on the new bandwagon of retail
banking" -- were particularly guilty of such infractions.3j But they were not alone.

Private investors discriminatedinadequately between good and bad credit risks.4/
Governmentsfailed to monitor the industry adequately and to discourage dubious
activities, even erring in the other direction as when, for example, they encouraged the

flotation and purchase of German bonds.5/

So it is alleged. Unfortunately, most of these assertions are difficult to test with
precision. It is tempting to cite, as successive authors have done, the poor cx post
performance of interwar loans as proof of the validity of the interpretation. There are
obvious dangers with drawing conclusions on the basis of 20-20 hindsight, however.
There was no reason for investors in the 1920s to anticipate an unprecedented
macroeconomic crisis on the scale

of the Great Depression. That their loans performed

poorly given the exceptionally poor state of the world does not suffice to impugn the
lending process.

5

It is more informativeto consider the market's ex ante assessment of the risks of
foreign lending. In Table

1

we report estimates of the determinants of spreads over risk

flee rates on foreign loans floated in New York and London in the 1920s. This analysis
utilizes ex ante yields to matutity on two samples of foreign bonds.d/ The regressions
relate the spread between those ex ante yields and contemporaneous Treasury bond rates
(consol rates for the U.K.) to counrty characteristics, current economic policies and

shifting capital-market conditions. The specification parallels that adopted by Edwards
(1986), who sought to address Guttentag and Herring's (1985) contention that rates

charged foreign borrowers on bank loans could not have incorporated adequate
countay-risk premia because they varied so little across loans. Edwards attempted to test

this hypothesis for both bank loans and bonds by regressing spreads on indicators for
countay risk such as the magnitude of the debt burden, the level
stance

of investment, the policy

of the debtor govemment,and other characteristicsof the borrower and the loan.

While he found for the bond market that the spread rose with the debVGNP ratio and
fell with the investment/ONE ratio, consistent with the hypothesis that lenders
distinguished among good and bad credit risks, his other coefficients were insignificant,

suggestingthat investorspald inadequate attention to other indicators of counuy risk.7J
The regressions in Table

1

seek to replicate the essence of this analysis for the

l920s. The spread on each loan is related to the value of the debt (scaled by exports),
to the category of borrower (national governments versus others), to the year in which
the loan was issued, and to the geographical location of the borrower. We include also
two measures of current economic policies and conditions in the borrowing country: the
wade balance and the budget balance. For the 1920s
measure

it is not possible to construct a

of the investment share of ONE like that used by Edwards for the 1970s and

Instead, contemporary investment manuals urged investors to focus on the trade and

1,1

The omitted alternatives from the

vectors of dummy variables (which are picked up by the constant term) are 1920,
Germany and national governmentbonds, The coefficients on years indicate little
tendency of tile spread to widen or narrow over time, as one would have expected had
foreign lending tended to come into

or fall out of fashion.9/ Relative to the omitted

alternative (national govermnentloans), higher spreads were charged on loans to states,
municipalities,corporations and banks, which is consistent with the ex post evidence that
loans to national governments outperformed these other loans from the creditors' point of
view.IQI Only the coefficient on loans to corporationsdiffers significantly from that on
the omitted alternative, however, In the case of sterling loans, where the omitted.
alternative is U.K-guaranteed British Funds, again there is evidence of informed
behavior: higher risk premia were charged on loans to local governments than to central

governments,and on foreign than on Dominion issues. These results contrast with those
of Edwards for the 1970s; he detected no discernible difference in spreads on loans to
different categories of borrowers.

In the equation for dollar bonds, the coefficients on regions suggest, not surprisingly,
that the best bond-market reputations were enjoyed by Canada, the Central American
republics and Western Europe. Both Canada and the countries of Western Europe had
virtually unblemished records of servicing their foreign debts, while the small Central

American republics economically

or politically dependent on the United States had little

choice in the marterjjJ Conversely, the nations of Eastern Europe were charged the
largest risk premia. These geographical variations are suggestive of bondholder
sophistication, insofar as the pattern

of ex post returns indoates that loans to Eastern

Europe were relatively risky and that those to Western Europe and Centtal America were

relatively safe. With hindsight, only the risk premium attached to German loans is
anomalous. The spreads on loans to Germany, the leading borrower of American funds,
were smaller on average than those on loans not only to Eastern Europe and South
America but to Austtalia and Japan as well. This is consistent with the view of the U.S.
State and Commerce Departments, voiced as early as 1925, that American investors
tended to underestimatethe risks associated with investmentin German bonds,12/

The results for sterling bonds are basically consistent. The average spread is smaller
(1.8 percentage points compared to 2.6 for the U.S.), perhaps reflecting the perception
that British loans were less risky given their rather different geographicaldestination; the

standard deviation of the spread is virtually identical (1.0 versus 1.1) to that for dollar
bonds. High risk premia were charged the Eastern European counthes, while Latin
America, Greece and Germany stood in the middle and the Domlnions and Japan enjoyed
the lowest costs of borrowing.

The dummy variables for countries and regions capture a combination of political
factors influencing the likelihood

of default and, presumably, reputational factors related

to past repayment performance. In a well-functioning market, investors should also take
into account current economic policies. The coefficients on the trade and budget
balances speak to this question. In the equations for both steriing and dollar bonds, their

coefficients have the anticipated negative signs (larger trade and budget Surpluses tendcd

8

to reduce spreads), although only budget surpluses in the equation for dollar bonds

differs significantly from zero at standardconfidence levels.j31
Absolute statements about the efficiency of a market are always problematic, but
that
comparative evaluations are more sutghfforward. In our case, there is no evidence
invastors were less discriminating in the l920s than in the 1970s. There is no evidence
that either banks or the bond market possessed a comparative advantage in the pricing of
foreign loans,

2, Causes of Default
The debt crisis of the 1930s unfolded in three stepsd4I The first, spanning calendar
1931, was dominated by Latin American defaults. Interest and amortizationpayments

were at least partially suspended by virtually every South American county but
middle of 1933,
Argentina. During the second phase, from the beginningof 1932 to the
default spread to Southern and Eastern Europe. The precise amount by which payments

were reduced varied across countries, but most couniries were affected to some extent.
The third phase. 'whose dawn coincided with the Monetary and Economic Conference of
1933, was dominated by the default of Germany, the single largest foreign debtor.

In the 1930s as in the 1980s, the debt crisis did not have a single cause. Liberal
to
foreign borrowing in the l920s had increased the debtor counoles' vulnerability

external shocks. In many Latin American countries, by 1928 central government
debt/export ratios had risen to well in excess of 100 per cent, and interest and amorti
zation on this component of the debt alone could require ten per cent of total export

receiptsi5/ In certaln cases, debt/exportratios were considerably higher (Table 2).
Germany, the largest single foreign borrower, had reparations as well as commercial

debts with which to contend; in 1928 reparations transfers plus commercial debt service
required more than 20 per cent of gross export receiptsid/
Starting in 1928 the debtor countries were battered by a series of external shocks

which increased their transfer burden and reduced their debt-servicingcapacity. First
was the sudden decline in lending by the United States and other creditor nations. The
mounting boom on Wall Sweet diverted American funds from foreign to domestic uses
and like a powerful suction pump siphoned off liquidity from the rest of the world. At
the beginning of 1928 approximately $800 million was required to meet foreign

d&ot

service payments on dollar debtsdl! Net short- and long-term foreign lending by the
United States had exceeded $1 billion in l927 and reached nearly $700 million in 1928.
Thus, despite the collapse of new lending in the summer of 1928, the new money

provided between January and June nearly sufficed to finance that year's dollar debt
service costs. In 1929, net short- and long-term lending by the United States earned

of the problem was
negative, and the $800 million bill came due, As in the 1980s, part
the suddenness of the shift
There could have been no less opportune time for the collapse of global commodity
markets. Primary commodity exporters had already come under strain. Their terms of

trade had been deteriorating steadily over the course of the 1920s. These then dropped
like a stone with the onset of the Depression. Lewis (1949) provides the sad litany.
"From 1929 to 1930 the avenge price of wheat

fei by

19

per cent, cotton 27 per cent,

wool 46 per cent, silk 30 per cent, rubber 42 per cent, sugar 20 per cent, coffee 43 per
cent, copper 26 per cent, tin 29 per cent, the index of prices of commodities entering
worid trade fell from 1929 to 1932 by 56 per cent for raw materials, 48 per cent for
foodstuffs and 37 per cent for manufactures."iSI It is these developments that

10

Diaz-Alejandro(1983) and Fishlow (1985) stress as determinants of default. They
emphasize first that the collapse of real export revenues was so severe that countries
could avoid default only through the most decisive, concerted action. They suggest that
the magnitude of the terms-of-tradedecline determined for whom the necessary steps
were still feasible. Argentina and Australia continued to service their debts, for example,
because as wheat exporters they suffered milder terms-of-tradedeclines than countries
like Brazil, which exported coffee, or Bolivia, which exported tin.

The impact of the export-pricecollapse on foreign exchangereceipts was reinforced
by the contraction of export volumes. Between 1929 and 1932, world trade in foodstuffs

fell by 11 per cent, trade in raw materials by 19 per centj9/ These observations are
consonant with the explanation for default which emphasizes the magnitude of the
external shock.

Empirical analysis of the incidence and extent of default suggests, however, that the
commodity lottery' (Diaz-Alejandro'sphrase) was only one of several determinants of
the borrowing countries' response. In Eichengreenand Portes (1986) we reported
regressions relating the percentage of governmentand government-guaranteed debt in
default (for all levels of government) at various points in the 1930s to

a vector of

country characteristics. These results confirm the importance of the commoditycomposition of exports and the export price shock: more severe terms of uade declines

increased the incidence and extent of default. But in addition to the commodity lottery,
the extent of default was significantly related to a number

of other variables. Holding

constant the terms of trade decline, more heavily indebted countries were more likely to
default.

Importantly,however, we found that, in additionto these measures of changes in the
debt burden and in debt-servicingcapacity,two other sets

of variables conditioned the

default decision, First, the domestic response to the external shock played an important
role. Countries which prevented large government budget dficits from emerging,
through either tax increases or expenditurereductions, were less likely to default than
their less spendthrift counterparts. To put the point another way, governments least

willing or able to retrench fiscally were least able to avoid default. Second, political
aspects

of the decision whether or not to suspend debt-service payments appear to retain

a role even after we control for economic characteristics

of the country. For example,

our equation significantly underpredicts the level of debt service maintained by Australia.
That Australia avoided default on even a portion of her external debt (nonwithstanding
attempts to suspend interest payments by a left-leaning state government in New South
Wales in 1931, which were countermandedby the national authorities) we attribute to
political ties to the country (Britain) to which the vast majority of the debt was owed.
Overall, this analysis provides a nuanced picture of the debt-servicingdecisions of
borrowing countries. One cannot sustain the argument that the severity of the external
shock left each defaulting country with no other option. Neither does it appear that the
only factor differentiatingtheir situations was the extent of the terms-of-trade decline.
The seventy of the external shock, the vulnerability of the economy, the domestic policy
response, and a broader range of political factors combined to influence the decision.

There are obvious parallels with the 1980s, when the Latin American debtors, in a

service on their debts, have been forced to adopt policies of

austerity which have resulted in nearly

a decade

of slow growth. But many observers

have cautioned the debtors that a moratorium or default, while

also have macroeconomic costs in terms

There are several reasons to treat the comparison with caution. For one, the
constellationof policies influencing growth may have differed across countries in ways
that are not directly attributable to their different debt-management strategies. Moreover,
there is the problem of sorting out the direction of causainy. As we explained in Secacn
2, countries suffering more severe declines in income were more likely to default; now

there is a suggestion that countries which defaulted enjoyed more rapid income growth.
There is nothing incompatible in the two arguments, but two-way causationposes
problems of identification. Even if the problems posed by the joinr endogeneityof
default and output growth can be solved, there is still the possibility that because

production declined more dramaticallybefore 1931 in countries which lapsed into default,
the emergence of higher levels of unemployment and excess capacity may have offered
more scope for output to snap back later. After suffering more serious terms-of-trade
declines before 1931, the serious defaulters may have benefited from more rapid

terms-of-tradeimprovementsas international commodity markets recovered thereafter.
In fact, however, Figure 3 while confirming the greater severity of the terms-of-trade
shock suffered by the heavy defaulters immediately after 1929 suggests that, with the
exception of 1934, the terms of trade of the two groups of countries subsequently evolved
more or less in parallel.2jJ
Data limitations, along both the quantity and quality dimensions, preclude the
estimation of a simultaneous-equations model to sort out these effects definitively. Our
approach is to rely instead on

a sequence of simpler descriptive analyses. None

eliminates all of the problems acknowledged above, but all tend to point in the same
direction.

Table 3 displays regressions in which we relate rates of growth

of industrial

production to both debt-management strategy (as measured by the share of government
and government-guaranteed debt, for all levels of government, in default) and the
severity of the external shock (as measured by the terms of trade).22/ To control for
cross-country differences in the secular rate

of growth, the dependentvariable is defined

as the deviation from the country mean for that variable for the sample period,
eliminating the need for a constant term./ To control for changes over time in the
global econorñic environment,we include a vector of dummy variables for years.
When the terms of trade is included along with the measure of default, both
variables tend to be associated with variations in growth. Although the coefficient on the
terms of trade exhibits instability, in general it appears that countries sufferingmore
severe external shocks grew more slowly, as one would expect. And strikingly, countries

with a larger share of their external debts in default grew more quickly. This continues
to be the case when the vector of dummy variables for years is added and when the
terms of trade variable is dropped.
One problem with basing inferences on these regressions is the likelihood that the
default variable

is endogenous. In defense of the ordinary least squares regressions in

Table 3 one might argue that only past output growth affects current default, while

current default influences future output, rendering the system recursive. In practice, it is
entirely possible for effects to run in both directions within a calendar year, however.
But the direction of any endogeneitybias should only reinforce conclusions drawn from
the ordinary least squares regressions in Table

rendering the estimates in the first three columnsof Table 3 lower bounds. The final

three columns therefore report two-stage least squares estimates, which utilize as
instuments for the percentage of debt in default the determinants of default identified in
Eichengreenand Portes (1986). These confirm that the coefficient on default tends to
increase in magnitude with this adjustment24l
To test the rubber band effect" (that countries which suffered the largest declines in
output in the early stages of the Depression had the greatest scope for recovery
subsequently), we regressed the rate

of growth of production over the recovery period

our default variable, the percentage change in the terms of trade, and the

percentage change in production between 1929 and 1931. Table 4 confirms that the
effect is present but that its inclusion does not reverse the coefficient on default.
The problem with such regressions is that they may fall to conirol adequately for
other respects in which the external environment and the stance of domestic economic
policy conditioned the pattern of growth.25/ On the side of pohcy, the decision whether
to continue external debt service was only one of a number of interrelated policy
responses to the macroeconomic shocks of the 'thirties. Lacking an articulated model of
fiscal policy, there was little conscious manipulation of budgetary instruments in the
1930s.2Q Monetary policy was more widely utilized, although monetary authorities were

constrained by inflationary fears, by the desire to defend the gold standard, and by
doubts regarding the effectiveness

of monetary reflation. The most widely adopted

measures were the complex of policies referred to under the rubric "import substitution."
With the collapse of their export markets following

1929, governments

adopted policies

designed, to varying degrees, to reduce their economies' dependence on exports and to
shift resources to import-competing uses. Exchange rates were devalued, first in

Australasia and Latin America and subsequently in other parts of the world. Increasingly
comprehensivesystems of tariffs and quotas, often supplemented by exchange controls,
were used to limit imports.

In some counties credit was extended by the public sector

on favorable terms to import-competingindustries, and a variety of other measures were
adopted to promote theft growth. The use of such policies may well have been related
to the choice of debt management strategy. Countries like Argentina. for example, which
continued to service theft debts did so by retaining resources in the export sector and by

relying on imports for the provision of other goods. Other counties like Brazil, which
reduced or suspended debt-servicepayments, had neither as urgent a need to generate
foreign-exchangereceipts nor as favorable access to certain creditor-countrymarkets, and
had reason to shift resources into the import-competingsector.fl' The simple correlation

of -0.30 between the measure of default in Table 3 and the import share of GNP (pooled
time-series cross-section data, defined as the deviationof the import share from the
country avenge for the sample period) is consistent with this view.
The consensus view of such policies as they operated in the last quarter century is
that they have proven inferior to the alternativeof export promotion.2I Experts indict
import substitution strategies for having insulated producers from the chill winds of
competition, for diverting resources into sectors far removed from comparative advantage,
for raising the cost of inputs into domestic production, and for discouraging industry
from achieving minimum efficient scale. But it need not follow that import substitution
was an inferior strategy in the l930s. Some country studies suggest that import
substitution worked rather well in particular instances29/ It is conceivable, for example,
that the effectiveness of import substitution relative to export promotion may depend on
the

nte of expansion of international

trade. When trade is expanding rapidly, as in the

In

an attempt

to capture the effects of this complex of policies, we added to the

Table 3 regressions the import share of GNP relative to the counny average for the
sample period. This measure captures not the different growth prospects of more- and
less-open economies but rather the implications of policies tending to increase or reduce
the rate

of import growth. The coefficient enters with a positive sign and differs from

zero at standard confidence levels, suggesting that counthes which raised their capacity

to import most rapidiy in the 1930s recovered most quickly from the Great Depression.

of GDP for defaulting and nondefaulting counthes, confirm that the growth of
reschedulers accelerated in 1984-85 relative to 1982-83, but shows that their performance
was still substantially worse than that of the non-reschedulers. Whereas only one of the

rescheduling promoted growth. Analyzing macroeconomic performance
well (as
developing countries, Linden 0988) finds that reschedulersperformed less

to eliminate
through even when instrumental variables are used in the attempt
simultaneity bias.

Two explanations for this difference between the 1930s and the 1980s suggest
themselves. First, compared to rescheduling in the 'eighties, default in the 'thirties
offered more scope for redirectingdomestic resources toward investment and other

domestic uses, Interruptions to debt service in the 1980s have been partial and
the
intermittent, and the net resource transfer to the creditors remains large. Second,
macroeconomic repercussinnsof default may have been different when interruptions to
debt service were widespread, as in the 1930s, rather than relatively isolated, as in the
1980s, It may have been harder for creditors to impose sanctions against defaulting

debtors precisely because default was so widespread.fl/ This brings us to the question
of how foreign investors and their governments responded to the crisis.
4. Default

and Capital Market Access

The immediate way for creditors to retaliate against default was to exclude the
debtor from the capital market. Starting in 1825, the London Stock Exchange refused

quotation to new loans of governments in default on outstanding obligations and in
extreme instances refused to quote all loans of the offending government. There existed
no comparable arrangement in New York, althoughit was still possible for individual

creditors to refuse accommodation to defaulting borrowers.

This is not to deny that lenders were cognizant of default, But the reaction against
portfolio investment abroad was general rather than selective.

A general sigh of resolve

was to be heard over the United States, Herbert Feis wrote.

Never again should we

lend

or invest our money in foreign lands.'32J American investors, having been rudely

reminded of the special risks of foreign loans, revised their assessment of the desirability

of lending abroad, The British and others reacted similarly, and they were significantly
constrained by controls on capital movements until the end of the 1950s. Hence the
market for portfolio investmentsremained becalmed for more than a third of a century.
Sovereign default may have had costs in terms of disruptions to capital market access.

But many of these costs were external to the defaulting countries and affected the market
access

of defaulters and nondefaulters alike.

Two caveats to this conclusion are in order. First, the generality of the capital

market's reaction may have been a function of the generalityof default. Default having
been so widespread, it led to a comprehensive reassessmentof the risks of international
lending which redounded unfavorably even on countries which had kept their debt

service up to date, In contrast, in periods like the 1920s, when the only countries in
serious default were Mexico and the Soviet Union, and the 1970s, when debt problems
were much more isolated than they became subsequently, the market may have been
more inclined to focus on the creditworthiness of particular countries and less inclined to

reassess the entire enterprise. Second, the market's tendency to discriminate among
countries according to their past debt-service records may differ during periods of
stagnation and buoyancy. Ozler (l988b) suggests that during the boom in bank finance

in the 1970s, larger spreads over the risk-free rate were demanded of countries with
records of having defaulted on loans in the past/ Still, there is little evidence that
defaulters were rationed out

of the market or that faithful rervcers were rationed

required as much as a quarter of a century to complete. Bolivia, the
default in 1931, was also the last major debtor to settle in 1955.

Brazil's experience is illustrative34i By 1931 the Depression had caused a
to
precipitous fall in Brazilian exports, leading the governmentin October 1931 suspend
interest payments unilaterally on most of the nation's external debts. In March 1932 a
plan was announced to issue 20 and 40 year funding bonds to capitalize interest arrears,
and to resume normal interest payments no later than 1934. But in 1934, with the
advice of British financial experts, Brazil announceda plan to readjust the debt. The
Aranha Plan, designed to run through 1937, limited debt service to roughly half of
Brazil's net export receipts. Bonds were divided into seven grades. tth funding loans
and other select obligations to receive full interest, other Federal, state and local loans
and
partial interest (from 17.5 to 50 per cent of contractual levels), and certain state
municipal loans no interest. At the end of 1937, with the external situation little

22

improved, debt-servicepayments were suspended again. Following sporadic negotlations

with the creditors, in 1940 Brazil announced another temporary, four year settlement,
under which the seven categories

of bonds distinguished in 1934 were to receive interest

at somewhat modifiedrates. Finally, in 1943 Brazil and her creditors negotiated a
permanent readjusment, in which bondholders had the option of choosing between two
plans, one which reduced interest rates from 30 to 70 per cent of contractual levels, and

a second under which they would surrender 20 to 50 per cent of capital in exchange for
a cash payment of 6 to 60 per cent of par value and somewhat higher interest rates on
the remainder,
Thus, while there may

be some truth to the notion that in the era of bond finance

debtors were better able to jettison their debt overhangs and redirect resources toward
domestic uses, the extent of the difference should not be exaggerated. Even when
payments were in suspension, there was often

a real possibility that they would be

restarted. In the 1930s as in the 1980s, investorshad reason to be wary about committinc

funds to domestic investment on the grounds that the authorities still might tax the
returns and devote them to debt service. The difference between periods lies not in the
uncertainty or in any difference in investment-debtservice links, but in the willingness

and ability of governments to reduce payments by a substantial fraction of contractual
rates,

The central difficulty that negotiators had to surmount was the large-numbers
problem created by the existence of a multitude
in the era

of bondholders, it was even harder than

of syndicated bank lending to solicit the opinions of the creditors on a

settlement proposal. Yet the British and, after 1933, the Americans came up with a

remarkably efficient solution to the representation problem. Cornmitees were appointed

announcementthat bond covenants were henceforth modified, If the plan was judged to
be fair or at least to be the best that could be expected, the committee would recommemi
its acceptance by the bondholders. The latter signified their approval by cashing a
coupon or, when requested, by exchanging the old certificate for a new one. The only
option available to dissident bondholders was to hold out for better terms.
The recommendation of a reputable bondholders committee was the seal of approval
on an offer. In Britain, where the Corporationof Foreign Bondholders (CFBH) had been
in existence since 1868 and was universally acknowledged to represent the creditors, that
recommendationcarried considerable weight. When the CFBH recommended an offer,
any Stock Exchange sanctionscould be expected to be withdrawn, and thssiden

bondholders had little hope of obtaining better terms.

In the United

States, a comparable

organizationwas created only in 1934 when, with State Department prompting, the
Foreign Bondholders Protective Committee came into operation. Prior to that time,
bondholders relied on ad hoc committees created to deal with individual defaults. The
ad hoc nature of such committees tended to inflate administrative expenses, while the
existence of rival committees, as well as committees of dubious reputation, made it
difficult for both debtors and creditors to determine who best represented the interests of
the bondholders.

Terms of Settlement
In contrast to the experience of highly indebted countries in the 1980s, interwar

default led in some cases to a substantial reduction in net resource transfers from debtors
24

to creditors. The estimates of Linden and Morton (1987). Jorgensen and Sachs (1988)

aee on this point.

Our own calculations,

of foreign bonds issued in the 1920s, reveal in addition

considerable variation in debtor and creditor experience34l

To summarize the performance of foreign loans issued between 1920 and 1929, we
calculated the nominal own-currency internal rate o. return on more than 300 issues.
These are summarizedin Table 8. For dollar bonds, at one extreme the realized return
marginally exceeded the contractual rate, as in the cases of Norway and Canada, due to
early debt retirement. At the other extreme, the realized internal rate of return might
reach substantial negative levels, such as -7.4 per cent for Brazil, -9,8 per cent for

Bolivia and -14.76 per cent for Hungary, indicating that not just interest but a substantial
fraction

of principal was written off by the creditors.

On average, however, both British and American creditors recovered their nncipal.
Our calculationssuggest that, for creditors with diversified foreign bond portfolios who
were willing to hold out for final settlement, the defaults of the 1930s were not as
disastrous as typically portrayed. The average nominal internal rate of return (weighted

by issue value) was roughly 4

per

cent on dollar bonds and in the range of 5 per cent

for sterling issues. While dollar bondholders settled for approximately half of contractual
interest and sterling bondholderssettled for only slightly more, on balance the former did
only slightly worse than if they had held domestic Treasury bonds, and the latter did
slightly better. Ex ante risk premia were nearly sufficient to compensate American
bondholders for the risks of foreign lending, while for British bondholders they more
than sufficed. Although some debtor countries received what can
substantial relief, overall the defaults

Three factors contributed to the rather different experiences of investors in dollar and
sterling bonds. First, loans to different categories

of creditors fared very differently in

the 1930s and 1940s. For both sterling and dollar issues, loans to national governments
yielded higher realized returns than loans to states and municipalities; loans to states and
municipalities in turn yielded higher realized returns than loans to foreign corporations.

And American investors purchased a disproportionate share of the speculative bonds
issued on behalf of foreign municipalities and corporations. Second, London and New
York channelled funds in different geographical directions. London specialized in new
overseas issues on behalf of the Commonwealth and colonies, and devoted a smaller

share of capital than New York to riskier loans to Latin America and Central Europe. It

is difficult to assess the extent to which London's behavior is attributable to the
sophistication

of a more experiencedmarket, to long-standingpolitical and financial ties

with the Commonwealth, to preferentialBritish tax treatment on colonial issues, or to the
Bank of England's intermittent embargoes on foreign issues.3! But the combined result
of these factors was a significantly lower incidence of default on sterling than on dollar
issues.

The differing prevalence of default does not by itself account, however, for
international differences in realized rates

of return. British creditors also recovered more

successfullyin the event of default. For the bonds in our sample, the average default on

a dollar issue cost the creditors more than four percentage points on realized rate of
return, while the average default on sterling issues cost them only about two percentage
points. Part

of the difference may be attributable to the greater effectiveness of the

British Corporation

of Foreign Bondholders than of its American counterpans.d/ Part

may also be attributable to the different stances

governments,to which we now turn.

of the British and American

7. Government Intervention
A

recurrent theme in much of the recent literature on the debt crisis (viz. Sachs

1986)

is that creditor-country governments have continually pressured the debtors to

maintain service on their obligations. One might think that in the 1930s and 1940s,
when creditor-countrybanking systems held only a small share of their portfolios in
foreign bonds and hence were not at risk in the event of foreign default, creditor-country
governments might have

felt less compulsion to intervene.31/ This view is supported by

the tendency of British officials between the wars to cite the remarks of their well-known
19th-century predecessors to the effect that the British governmentwas not a debt
collector. American officials argued likewise that the higher returns on foreign loans
than on contemporaneous domestic investments represented implicit acknowledgement of,
and compensation for, the special risks of lending abroad, and that investors had no

justification for seeking assistance.
In fact, governments were intimately involved in interwar debt readjusiments. There
is nothing unprecedentedabout the extent of government intervention in the 1980s, The

extent and nature of this involvement varied over time and across creditor countries.
Thus, British governments in the 1930s were more willing to intervene than the Roosevelt
Administration. The British used the Ottawa Agreements

of 1932, which provided

preferential British market access to the Commonwealth and Empire at the expense of
foreign exporters, to secure favorable treatment of sterling debts by Argentina, in return

for tariff preferences under the provisions of the 1933 Roca-Runcirnan

TreatyJ/

The

Americans were more hesitant to link trade and debt, especially once Roosevelt was
converted to the arguments of Cordell Hull and the U.S. began to move back toward
freer trade with the adoption of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934. The

27

links between U.S. Export-Import Bank loans and commercial debts varied over time,
On some occasions the U.S. extended Eximbank loans despite the existence of unsettled
defaults; on others officials made clear that Eximbank decisions had a political dimension

and might be torpedoed by Congress without progress on the debt front. Along with
several European governments,Britain threatened to impose clearing arrangements upon

Germany following her default in 1933, leading to the partial or full resumptionof
service on Germany's European bonds. No clearing was threatened by the United States,

and no significant interest payments were made to Germany's American creditors over
the remainder of the decade. But until the outbreak of World War II involved
governments directly in nearly every aspect of international trade and finance, their

interventionwas limited largely to instances where public officials had actively promoted
the original issues (as in the case of Germany's Dawes and Young Plan loans) or when
the debtor discriminated against one class of national creditors in favor of others.
With the approach of the war, creditor-country pressure for settlement intensified.
But in contrast to the 1980s, on more than one occasion considerable pressure was
applied to the creditors as well as the debtors. In addition to providinginformation and
advice to the bondholders' representativecommittee and objecting to discriminatory
provisions included in settlement offers, governments sometimes intervened directly in

negotiationsif they felt that progress was inadequate. A favorable settlement for the
creditors was not often viewed

as a

high priority relative to international trade

concessions and international security agreements. Creditors were urged to settle, in no

uncertain terms,

if their obstinacy

stood in the way of these other goals.

Essentially, the difference in government intervention in the l930s and 1980s lies

not in its extent but

its direction, Where U.S.

officials in the 'eighties have made clear

the priority they attach to maintaining debt service, in the 'thirties and 'forties, when
governments intervened, they might pressure both debtors and creditors to reach an early
agreement.

8. Global

Plans

The debt difficulties that arose at the beginning of the 1980s for Poland, Turkey
and others were regarded as country-specific problems. This perception was transformed
by the Mexican and Brazilian crises in August-September

1982.

These countries not only

required emergency rescue packages, but their problems brought the international
fmancial community to recognize that it faced a generalizeddebt crisis.
The policy reaction was guided partly by the objective of avoiding contagion
effects that might lead to a general financial crisis like that of the early 1930s (see
Eichengreenand Portes, 1987, for a comparison). The perception that serious debtservicing problems were already widespread prompted the elaboration

of several

proposals for global solutions. These plans have been surveyed and analyzed by Cline
(1987) and Fischer (1987), Most involved taking the debt off the books

of the

commercial banks at a discount and reducing the debtors' repayment obligations
correspondingly.

Typically, they required a new or existing international financial

institution to implement the scheme.

Objections to these plans center on three points: the need for a grand political
agreement to authorize and initiate the scheme, for uniformity of procedure for all

debtors or at least for agreed criteria for discriminating among them, and for taxpayers in
creditor countries to defray the cost of debt relief. For all three reasons such ge-ieral

schemes seem unlikely to be adopted.

29

Most authors of global solutions to the debt crisis of the 1980s are unaware that
similar plans were widely discussed half a century earlier, Some, like current proposals

under which the World Bank or International Monetary Fund would play a central role,
suggested that the newly-established Bank for International Settlements be endowed with

the funds and authority needed to readjust defaulted debts on a global basis. Others
advocated instead an independentfacility under the control of private creditors, Some
advocated converting existing debts into new obligations, not unlike the debt-equity

swaps and seniority provisions so fashionable teday, while others emphasized the need to
index payments to export revenues (compare Fern under Oarcia) or to service the debt in
local currency (see Dornbusch, 1988).
Four sets of global schemes can be distinguished39/ The first proposed to endow
the Bank for International Settlements with the resources needed to resolve the crisis.
The B.I.S, had been establishedin 1930 as part of the Young Plan rescheduling of
German reparations;

it was logical to propose that it might also take charge of other debt

problems. Hubert Henderson,

a highly-placed British governmenteconomic advisor,

suggested that the B.I.S, issue unbacked 'InternationalCertificates" to exporting countries
to finance debt service payments and other economic needs.

The 1931 Kindersley-Norman Plan, named after Montagu Norman, Governor of the
Bank of England, and Robert Kindersley, one of its directors, proposed the establishment

of a new international facility to make loans to countries and corporationsunable to
obtain them through normal channels.

This new international entity was to be

capitalized by the leading creditor-country governments and further financed through the
sale

of bonds to private investors, The agency would extend new loans to indebted

countries unable to obtain them through the market, "reestablishing the credit of the
foreign Governments,corporations, etc., to whom the money is lent ... improving the

price of their securities ...

and the purchasing

power of their nationals.4Q/ Like a

mutual fund, .t would in effect resell packages

of these claims to private investors in the

creditor countries.
The Beyen and Crena de Jongh Plans, offered by a pair of Dutch bankers to the
Standstill Conferencein the winter

of 193 1-32, addressed the problem of short-term

into
debts. Beyen proposed to convert short-term debts frozen by debtor governments

as 20 years. Debtors that
long-term obligations repayablein installments over as long
did not possess enough foreign exchange to meet their current obligations might be

of payments in domestic currency a step further. He proposed a central administrator to

toward countries requiring foreign funds for purposes including the resumption of debt

subscribed by creditor-country governments. Representatives

endorsed variants of the plan.

It is a pessimistic commentaryon the global plans currently under considerationthat
none of their interwar predecessors bore fruit. Implementingthose schemes would have
required a serious commitment on the part of the leading creditor-country governments.

31

But at each juncture, domestic problems divertedtheir attention from the international
debt crisis, In 1931 Britain was battling increasingly intense balance-of-payments
difficulties, which ultimately drove her from the gold standard in September of that year.

In 1933, the Roosevelt Administrationturned toward devaluation and away from
international policy coordinatioo precisely when the World Economic Conference was

poised to take up the debt problem. As a result that conference limited its efforts to the
increasingly turbulent exchange-ratesituation.

Even when governments and banks were willing to entertain the possibility of an
international debt facility, there remained insoluble problems of finance and control.
Under the provisions of the Kindersiey-Nomian Plan, for example, the bulk of new
finance was supposed to come from private investors, But the large investors, such as
J.P. Morgan, expressed their unwillingness to contribute unless control over any new
organizationalso rested in private hands. For their part, governments insisted that
control be allocated according to the nationality of the finance. In 1931, for example,
the Bank of France insisted that control rest with it on the grounds that the largest single
share of the funds would be donated by Paris.
Finally, there were debilitating disputes over what countries and what obligations to
include. At the 1933 World Economic Conference the United States declared all
discussion of war debts off limits, The realization that debt relief on inter-allied
obligations was unlikely to be forthcoming weakened the resolve of European countries
who would have preferred to take up the whole interlocking set

9

of debts.

Market Solutions

In contrast to global plans, market-based debt reduction made a useful contribution
to the resolution

of the interwar debt crisis, We refer to repurchascs of bonds un the
32

market, often at prices substantially below par. Similar practices have been discussed

recently by Portes (1987), USUNA (1988), and Williamson (1988), and been utilized
extensively by Mexico (for private sector debt) and by Bolivia. Their efficacy
a subject

has been

of controversy.4jJ The argument that buybacks out of reserves leave the debtor

worse off (since reserves are sacrificed without any reduction in the debt, the market

price of remaining obligations simply rising to reflect the country's unchanged
debt-servicingcapacity) is difficult to reconcile with the revealed preference of interwar
governments, many of which utilized the option extensively, as well

as

with the market

prices of the bonds repurchased at the time. In 1939 the Foreign Bondholders Protective
Committee estimated that

a dozen countries in default had repatriated between 15 and 50

per cent of their bonds since the beginning of the decade. Jorgensen and Sachs estimate
that Bolivia repurchased five per cent of its defaulted debt at an average price of 16, that
Chile retired 18 per cent at 59, Colombia 22 per cent at 22, and Peru 31 per cent at 21.

Buybacks were controversial. Dorribusch (1988) points to opposition by some
creditors, while Skiles (1988) notes that because creditorsobjected so strenuously to the
practice, most of these bond repurchases were carried out through intermediaries."

Another interpretationof the use of intermediaries was that debtors wished to avoid
driving up bond prices by signaling their policy through first-person appearance in the
market. In fact, the time-series behavior

of bond prices suggests little systematic

reaction to repurchases of securities in default, There is little evidence that debtors
sought to depress prices immediately prior to repurchases, or that buybacks had a major
impact on price trends. Figure 5, for example, displays high and low market prices for a
sterling loan to the Chilean Governmentissued in the 1920s, along with estimates of the

volume of repurchases of bonds (valued at par).421 The data for a variety of other bonds

33

tell a similar story. The Chilean case is particularly interesting since the country was

one of the first to engage in extensive buybacks and was the target of criticism by
creditors. Figure 5 shows that the buyhacks

of the second half of the i930s, second half

of the i940s and first half of the 1950s were not preceded by unusual declines in bond
prices, nor did they result in major price increases, although in the 'thirties and 'forties
some upward movement in prices is observed,

The private attitude of the bondholders committees toward repurchases differed
significantly from theft public position on the question.43] 10 public the bondholders'

committeescomplalned that any available foreign exchangeshould be allocated to thc
resumptionof debt service and contractual amortization rather than to repurchases of
defaulted bonds at a discount. They objectedto the potential for debtors to manipulate
bond prices by declaring their inability to service their debts, and then to turn around and
retire the debt as soon as the prices fell. In private, the committees were much more
receptive to the practice, especially if it was accompanied by the resumption of at least
partial debt service payments, and when the creditors were unlikely to receive a better
offer.
Numerous examplescould be cited. For example, in December 1936, following the

unilateralimposition of restrictedrepayments and interest by Chile, representativesof the
U.S. bondholders refused to accept the reduced interest payments that had been deposited
in New York. Chile then borrowed from Schroeders in London on this security in order
to purchase bonds in the market. The Council of Foreign Bondholders did not object; it
noted with satisfaction that "the Finance Minister so far has obtained and used $4 million
for purchases."J As part of the 1940 temporary settlement recommended by the
Council, the Brazilian authorities devoted 'at least $400,000 in each

34

of four years"

to

purchases in the English market.45J

In the 1941 Colombian negotiations, the Council of

Foreign Bondholders was asked to agree that all the sterling debt be repurchased in the
market. While it objected to the "disastrous precedent" that might be set, its members

admitted that "we have long become acclimatized to the idea of a debtor being allowed
to devote some sums to amortization,provided that he is paying

on

the principal of his debt."45/ Typically, the bondholders argued that purchases below par
should take place only if at least partial service was being paid. Thus, in 1944 the

Council of Foreign Bondholders decided "to refuse to consider a settlement of the
Ecuadoreandebt by means of a purchase offer at below par" unless at the same time the
bondholders were offered an option of partial service on the debt.47/
Perhaps the most revealing exchange surrounded the hearings of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission investigation into defaulted for bonds in 1937.4W The SEC
had recomnended that in order to curb the repatriation of bonds by defaulters measures
be introduced to restrain bankers and brokers from dealing on behalf of governments in
default, The Council of Foreign Bondholders noted that such restraints on repurchases

would be met with "strong and

... effective criticism

on the ground that, by limiting thc

market in such bonds, it would act detrimentally to the bondholders, "49/
Clearly, debt buybacks were controversial. But many British and American experts

regarded them favorably, especially when they were accompanied by other measures
designed to readjust the debt.

safe investurentyou would have to use care and judgement, you would have to consider
the many different factors which I have mentioned or hinted at, the character of the

35. In what follows 'we concentrate on the results reported in Eichengreen and Fortes
(1988b), utilizing samples of 207 dollar bonds and 125 sterling bonds issued between
1920 and 1929. This analysis is an extension of the pilot study utilizing two
considerably smaller samples first reported in Eichengreen and Fortes (1986).
36, For further discussion

of this possibility, see Fichenereen and Portes (1988h)

37. For the interwar data available on the weight of foreign bonds in American banks'
asset portfolios, see Eichengreenand Portes (1987), pp. 23-24.
38. Details on the Roca-Runciman conventionand references to the surrounding
literature may be found in Abreu (1984).
39. These plans are described in more detail in Eichengreen(1989).
40. Quotation cited in Eichengreen(1989), pp. 12-13.
41. See in particular the critique of Bulow and Rogoff (1988).
42. We imputed the quantity of buybacks from figures provided by the Council of
