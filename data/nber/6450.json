The results indicate that the Consumer Price Index does a reasonably accurate job reconciling self-reported changes in financial status with measured changes in real income.  Earlier work by Nordhaus (1998) reached a different conclusion  because it did not account for changes in the shape of the income distribution.\n\n",
