    "abstract": "\n\nDespite widespread interest, there is little systematic evidence on the relationship between income, wealth, and charitable giving. We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to provide descriptive statistics on this relationship. We find that, irrespective of specifica\u00adtion, donative behavior increases with greater resources.\n\n",
