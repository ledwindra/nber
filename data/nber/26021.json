    "abstract": "\n\nRecent research has focused on what shapes gender differences in academic achievement and students\u2019 choice of university field of study. In this paper we examine how teachers\u2019 gender role attitudes and stereotypes influence the gender gap by affecting the school environment. We explore the extent to which teachers\u2019 gender bias in high school influences students\u2019 school attendance and academic performance in high-stakes university admission exams and students\u2019 choice of university field of study. We use data from a large number of high schools in Greece, where the performance in these high-stakes exams determines university admission. We measure teachers\u2019 bias as the difference between a high school student\u2019s school exam score and national exam score. We then define a teacher bias measure at the class level by the difference between boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 average gap between the school score and the national score. We link teachers over time to obtain a persistent teacher bias measure based on multiple classes, and to estimate the effect for later cohorts\u2019 performance. We find a very high correlation of within-teacher gender biases measured in different classes, which reveals high persistency in teachers\u2019 gender favoritism behavior. We then find substantial effects of these teacher biases on students\u2019 school attendance and performance in university admission exams, quality of enrolled degree and the given field of study at the university. We also find that gender biases are more prevalent among low value added teachers, while the more effective teachers have an approximately neutral gender attitude. This suggests that less effective teachers can harm their students twice, by being a bad teacher and by discriminating against one of the genders.\n\n",
