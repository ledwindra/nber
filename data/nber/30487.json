    "abstract": "\n\nWe study neighborhood choice using a novel research design that contrasts the move rate of homeowners who receive a new different-race neighbor immediately next-door versus slightly further away on the same block. This approach isolates a component of household preferences directly attributable to their neighbors\u2019 identities. Both Black and White homeowners are more likely to move after receiving a new different-race neighbor. These findings are robust to additional controls (e.g., income) and alternative research designs. We find evidence of heterogeneity in responses, especially associated with housing density, which has implications for understanding contemporary neighborhood racial change and the prospects for maintaining stable, integrated neighborhoods.\n\n",
