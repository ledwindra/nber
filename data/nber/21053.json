    "abstract": "\n\n\u201cMultigenerational mobility\u201d refers to the associations in socioeconomic status across three or more generations.  This article begins by summarizing the longstanding but recently growing empirical literature on multigenerational mobility.  It then discusses multiple theoretical interpretations of the empirical patterns, including the one recently proposed in Gregory Clark\u2019s book The Son Also Rises.\n\n",
