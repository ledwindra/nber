    "abstract": "\n\nWe use the prices of credit card asset-backed securities to study the market risk premium associated with unsecured consumer credit  risk.  The consumer credit risk premium has historically been comparable to high yield corporate bond spreads, but has increased dramatically since the  financial crisis. We find evidence that this increase is primarily due to  balance-sheet costs imposed by recent changes in regulatory capital requirements  which have effectively placed credit card securitizations back onto issuer balance  sheets. These changes in capital regulation may have added hundreds of basis  points to the cost of unsecured household credit.\n\n",
