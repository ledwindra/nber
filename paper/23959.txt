ABSTRACT
We explore the links between social capital and labor market networks at the neighborhood level.
We harness rich data taken from multiple sources, including matched employer-employee data
with which we measure the strength of labor market networks, data on behavior such as voting
patterns that have previously been tied to social capital, and new data – not previously used in the
study of social capital – on the number and location of non-profit sector establishments at the
neighborhood level. We use a machine learning algorithm to identify important potential social
capital measures that best predict neighborhood-level variation in labor market networks. We find
evidence suggesting that smaller and less centralized schools, and schools with fewer poor
students, foster social capital that builds labor market networks, as does a larger Republican vote
share. The presence of establishments in a number of non-profit oriented industries are identified
as predictive of strong labor market networks, likely because they either provide public goods or
facilitate social contacts. These industries include, for example, churches and other religious
institutions, police departments, fire and rescue services including volunteer fire departments,
country clubs, mayors’ offices, chamber music groups, hobby clubs, and museums.

I. Introduction
The Oxford English dictionary defines social capital as “The networks of relationships among
people who live and work in a particular society, enabling that society to function effectively.” 1 In this
paper, we explore the links between measures of social capital and labor market networks among people.
Specifically, we use machine learning methods to examine whether higher social capital in a neighborhood
is associated with stronger labor market networks among neighbors. We harness the richness of data taken
from multiple sources, including matched employer-employee data with which we measure the strength of
labor market networks, data on behavior such as voting patterns that have previously been tied to social
capital, and new data – not previously used in the study of social capital – on the number and type of nonprofit sector establishments at the neighborhood level.
We are motivated in this paper by the large body of empirical research documenting the importance
of informal contacts in yielding successful labor market outcomes. The origins of this research are usually
traced to Granovetter (1974). He interviewed people in Newton, Massachusetts about how they found their
jobs, finding that about half of workers (among technical, professional, and managerial workers) found
their jobs through a social contact. However, many also found jobs through a work contact, emphasizing
that friends and relatives are not the only potential source of information about jobs or referrals to jobs.
Later survey evidence summarized in Ioannides and Datcher Loury (2004) establishes some reliance on
friends and relatives to find jobs; in particular, they report that 15.5 percent of the unemployed and 8.5
percent of the employed contact friends and relatives as part of their job search. Our work derives even
more specifically from recent empirical research showing that networks based in residential communities or
neighborhoods improve labor market outcomes for local residents, including higher wages, longer tenure,
and for individuals displaced from jobs, faster re-employment (Hellerstein et al., 2014, and Hellerstein et
al., 2016). 2

The goal of our study is to explore the connection between social capital and labor market
networks. Given, on the one hand, strong interest in social capital, and, on the other hand, all of the work
documenting the importance of neighborhood-based labor market networks to labor market outcomes of its
residents, we ask what we view as a fundamental question that has not been explored previously: When
social capital is higher in a neighborhood, are neighbors better networked in terms of the jobs they hold? In
addressing this question, we make four key contributions to the research literature on both social capital
and labor market networks. First, we connect these two literatures by asking how neighborhood levels of
social capital are linked to the strength of local labor market networks. Second, we draw on a unique data
set – the National Establishment Time Series, or NETS – to construct novel measures of location-based
social capital based on the non-profit sector. Third, given that we have many potential social capital
measures, we use a machine learning algorithm to select the measures that are predictive of the strength of
local labor market networks, rather than making a priori assumptions about which social capital measures
belong in our empirical specifications. And fourth, we examine the link between social capital and labor
market networks using a local labor market network measure that, as discussed below, we have previously
demonstrated to be important for labor market outcomes.
The social capital measures we study have been hypothesized in the previous literature to increase
connections among neighbors and should also foster labor market networks as we measure them. We
construct neighborhood-level measures of social capital that fit into four broad categories.
First, we construct measures reflecting the demographic homogeneity of neighborhoods. These
measures are motivated by findings in Alesina and La Ferrara (2002), suggesting that trust of others both in
the community and more generally in society is viewed as an important component of social capital and is
partly a function of community characteristics that are shared among residents (Lochner et al., 1999).
Second, we use information on the size and characteristics of local school districts to construct a

in the same block group but not on the same block. (The latter may be alike, but are less likely to be networked.)
Taking this further, Hellerstein et al. (2011) and Hellerstein et al. (2014) show that neighbors are more likely to work
at the same business establishment, consistent with the hypothesis that labor market networks mitigate information
imperfections in the labor market.

set of variables that could plausibly reflect the extent of parental involvement in schools. We hypothesize
that greater parental involvement in schools generates social capital, as parents are invested in schools and
interacting with each other’s children and with other neighborhood residents. We believe that this
involvement will be higher in smaller schools that are more community based (Cotton, 1996; Gardner et al.,
2000) in schools with higher-income parents (Guryan et al., 2008), and in schools with smaller studentteacher ratios.
Third, we use voting behavior measures that include voter turnout, prevailing political opinion, and
ideological homogeneity. Voter turnout is associated with high civic participation (Guiso et al., 2004),
another important reflection of social capital (Lochner et al., 1999). Other studies have shown that liberals’
and conservatives’ political priorities arising from differences in moral perspectives (Haidt, 2007) lead to
trusting different institutions (Putnam, 1994, and Dugan, 2015). For example, Putnam (1994) suggests that
conservatives may be more supportive of local, potentially more private associations that build social
capital at the local level, whereas liberals might be less supportive out of a concern that current inequalities
will be embedded in local social capital. 3 Because these institutions may differ in the extent to which they
build neighborhood social capital that augments labor market networks, we include the Democratic twoparty vote share. We also control for ideological homogeneity by way of the maximum of the two-party
vote share, because homogeneity has been shown in other contexts to foster social capital (Alesina and La
Ferrera, 2002), and, in this case, would indicate that others in your community share your beliefs.
Finally, the major focus of our paper is to build on past work suggesting that civic institutions (e.g.,
Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 2000), religious organizations (e.g., Putnam, 2000; Putnam and Campbell, 2012),
and other non-profits (Rupasingha et al., 2006) contribute importantly to social capital. To explore the role
of these non-profits as facilitators of social capital that strengthen labor market networks, we make novel
use of a new data source in the study of social capital. Specifically, we use data on the universe of
establishments, from the National Establishment Time Series (NETS), to measure the number and

al., 1987).

composition of non-profits by Census tract, and we explore – using our machine learning methods – which
ones are associated with evidence of stronger labor market networks.
To be clear, our main contribution with regard to social capital is our exploration of the role of nonprofits, via the introduction of this new data. We use the other social capital measures, derived from the
literature, in part to reflect that literature, but also to establish whether the estimated effects of the nonprofit-related social capital measures we introduce are likely to reflect variation in social capital that is
independent of the proxies for social capital others have proposed. Our inclusion of these other proxies
should not be viewed as us insisting that these measures from the literature in fact reflect social capital.
The goal of our analysis is to explore the relationships between these measures of social capital and
the measure of the importance of neighborhood-based labor market networks developed in Hellerstein et al.
(2011). This network measure is explained below, but its core idea is to quantify the extent to which
neighbors are clustered at the same employers, controlling for the geographic proximity of peoples’
workplaces to where they live. We construct this measure using data from the Longitudinal EmployerHousehold Dynamics (LEHD) program at the U.S. Census Bureau, which provides highly comprehensive
wage and salary employment data. This matched employer-employee data links persons to residences and,
if they are employed in a job covered by Unemployment Insurance, to the locations of establishments of
their employer.
Theoretical models of labor market networks assume that there is imperfect information that
hinders the search behavior of unemployed workers and/or firms, and that information flows through
networks. These models generally fall into one of two categories that describe the information
imperfections and how they are mitigated by networks. First, in models such as Calvó-Armengol and
Jackson (2007) and Ioannides and Soetevent (2006), unemployed workers do not have full information
about job vacancies, and job searchers can learn about job vacancies either directly from employers or
indirectly via employed individuals among their network contacts. Second, in Montgomery (1991), the
information imperfection is on the employer side, and firms learn about a potential worker’s ability if the
firm employs individuals from the potential worker’s network. In both of these frameworks, the existence

4

of the network increases the job-finding probabilities of unemployed job searchers. 4
The measure of clustering we use captures the network connections between neighbors arising
from either of these two models. Of course, as in nearly all research on labor market networks, we cannot
directly observe the flow of information about jobs or applicants in the labor market. However, our past
work has, in our view, validated the measure we use as capturing the effects of this flow of information. In
particular, our network measure is associated with higher wages for employed workers and longer job
tenure (Hellerstein et al., 2014), both consistent with better labor market matches when our network
measure is higher. And it is associated with faster re-employment of workers who lose jobs in mass layoffs,
and a higher likelihood of re-employment at a neighbor’s employer (Hellerstein et al., 2016), consistent
with employed neighbors providing referrals to their employers, or providing information about job
vacancies to unemployed workers in their network.
Moreover, our network measure of the extent to which neighbors are clustered at the same
employer could potentially reflect other influences. As a result, in our past work we have used rich models
to control for other – non-network – sources of relationships between our empirical network measure and
these outcomes, mostly related to either variation in the strength of local labor markets, and sorting of
workers across geographic locations who likely to experience similar labor market outcomes, including
taking similar jobs. For example, in our work on re-employment after mass layoffs (Hellerstein et al.,
2016), we control for highly-detailed fixed effects so that we identify the effect of networks from
subgroups of workers who experience the same mass layoff at the same employer in the same county, and
who differ only in terms of the Census tract in which they reside – and the variation in the network measure
across those tracts. And in asking whether our network measure is associated with higher wages or longer
job matches (Hellerstein et al., 2014), we net out (via potential controls in our regressions) variation in the
network measure that could be explained by neighbors tending to work in the same Census tract – which
would inevitably lead to some working at the same employer – because of transportation infrastructure or
simple geographic proximity.

4

Jackson (2008, Chapter 10) provides a transparent discussion and comparison of these models.

5

As a result of these prior analyses, we assume that our empirical network measure is related to the
flow of information about jobs between neighbors. Our analysis is cross-sectional, based on a network
measure we have constructed for one year (2010) and social capital measures that correspond as closely as
possible to that year based on data availability. While our network measure is an indirect measure of the
underlying “construct,” which is the flow of information – in this case, between neighbors – we believe this
interpretation of our measure is supported by the extensive prior research we have conducted. We do not
explore what drives the variation in our social capital measures. While we are not particularly concerned
with reverse causation, it is possible that there are other characteristics of neighborhoods associated with
our social capital measures that also influence the extent to which neighbors are networked in the labor
market. We do try to use a comprehensive set of potential measures of neighborhood-level social capital to
explain variation in our network measure, as well as some obvious control variables that will likely help
explain our network measure. Nonetheless, given that social capital is multi-dimensional, and given that
there are many other neighborhood characteristics that could potentially help explain variation in our
network measure, our evidence should be viewed primarily as descriptive work that can strengthen existing
hypotheses and potentially generate new ones about the links between social capital and labor market
networks. In this way, our research is similar in approach to Chetty et al. (2014), which, in part, examines
how factors varying across geographies correlate with upward mobility. More closely related – although
focused on crime rather than labor market outcomes – is Sharkey et al. (2017), who study the relationship
between crime and local non-profits that focus on reducing violence.5
Given the exploratory nature of this paper, and the large number of possible social capital
measures, we use a machine learning algorithm to identify important potential social capital measures that
best predict the variation in our labor market network measure. We view the use of machine learning as a

5
Sharkey et al. use a different and narrower data source on non-profits, from the National Center for Charitable
Statistics, which includes organizations that have registered for tax-exempt status with the IRS. We explored using
this same data source, but decided not to because the tax-exempt unit is often a central location, meaning we could not
identify local establishments of an organization. Moreover, we were interested in very local measures of
establishments – at the tract level – whereas Sharkey et al. use city-level measures. Finally, establishments in the nonprofit sector that are not themselves non-profits – but are included in our data – can play a role in enhancing social
capital.

key component of this research. There are many potential variables that could explain variation in the
strength of labor market networks and also can be interpreted as capturing social capital. We want to let the
data tell us which variables to include. The machine learning helps us avoid having to choose, ex ante,
which of these variables are likely to reflect social capital, or, worse, to search for significant predictors
that can be most easily interpreted, ex post, as reflecting social capital. In addition, the machine learning
algorithm we use (LASSO) imposes sparsity on the candidate social capital measures, which, given that we
have a large vector of such candidate measures, helps in providing interpretable estimates by focusing on
the most important predictors.
II. The Observed Network Isolation Index
The first important task is to define our measure of the neighborhood labor market network. Our
measure, developed in Hellerstein et al. (2011), uses worker-level data and captures the extent to which
employees of a business establishment come disproportionately from people who live in the same
neighborhood (defined as a Census tract). This measure is important because the models of labor market
networks we reference above predict that that if neighbors are networked together they will cluster at the
same establishments.
We use Census tracts as our residential neighborhood definition because Census tracts define the
boundaries that are traditionally used to measure residential segregation (Iceland and Weinberg, 2002), and
because Census tracts are defined to ensure that the tracts are “as homogeneous as possible with respect to
population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions” (U.S. Census Bureau, n.d. (a)). This is a
reasonable definition of a neighborhood in which co-residents are likely to interact, more so because most
Census tracts are relatively small, facilitating contact at schools, churches, community organizations, etc. –
a point we return to below. To help ensure that neighborhoods are compact enough to facilitate interaction
among residents, we restrict the Census tracts in our analysis to “urban” tracts, which are defined based on
population density, and may fall in both central cities and suburbs. Limiting our analysis to urban tracts
focuses our analysis on areas where workers live closer together and sort across a large set of employers, so
any effects of social capital should be more apparent with this sample both due to a high capacity of social

7

interaction and potentially more evidence of clustering in establishments in our measure of labor market
networks.
To construct our worker-level network measure, we compute for each worker, in the establishment
where they work, the percentage of his or her co-workers who live in the same Census tract. For worker i in
tract c this observed network isolation is:

∑I
(1)

NIic =

j ≠i

C

(i, j ) ⋅ I E (i, j )

∑I
j ≠i

E

(i, j )

,

where IC(i, j) is an indicator for whether co-worker j of worker i also lives in the same Census tract as i, and
IE(i, j) is an indicator for whether i and j work in the same establishment. The sums in the numerator and
denominator are taken over all workers other than the worker i who work in worker i’s establishment. Their
ratio is the share of co-workers with whom each worker is co-resident. 6
We operationalize a measure of network isolation at the neighborhood level by averaging NIic over
individuals who live in the same Census tract. This community-based network index is a natural metric
because it is derived from the individual network measure developed and tested previously by Hellerstein et
al. (2011). We construct the observed community-based network index in two different (but closely related)
ways. The first version of the index builds up from the observed network index NIic for all employed
neighbors in a residential Census tract at that time. Then, at the community level, the community network
index is the average of the network indexes of each of the neighbors:

(2)

Wc
W

Wc

∑ NI
i =1

ic


 ×100,


where Wc is the number of employed neighbors (i.e., workers) in the neighborhood.
The second version of our community-based network index is constructed over all residents of a
Census tract who are of working-age, whether or not they are employed. We denote this measure as NIcP,
where P signifies that this measure is calculated over people, not workers. It is measured as:

6

We define workers at single-employee firms (who have no co-workers) as having an NIic of zero.

8

(3)

1
 Pc

NIcP = 

Pc

∑ NI
i =1

ic


 ×100,


where Pc is the number of working-age neighbors (i.e., people) in the neighborhood. Because we define NIic
= 0 for persons who are not employed, NIcP will always be smaller than NIcW, more so when the
employment rate in the tract is lower (as NIcP then includes more zeros).
The strength of any relationships between social capital measures and labor market networks may
differ across the two measures. If social capital primarily influences employment outcomes for those who
would be employed in any case, by increasing the number of workers who share an employer, then we
might expect stronger relationships between social capital and NIcW. But an effect of social capital on
employment itself could strengthen the estimated relationships with NIcP, if the additional employed people
tend to work with their neighbors. That said, NIcW may be a preferable measure regardless, because it is
more likely to be independent of local economic conditions that may be correlated with our social capital
measures (in particular, those that are counts of establishments in the non-profit sector) – a correlation that
could create spurious evidence of a relationship between social capital and NIcP.
For this project, we draw data from multiple sources, some public and some restricted-access. The
dataset for measuring NIcW and NIcP, our network measures, is the Census Bureau’s LEHD Infrastructure
Files, which combine state-provided data on earnings records for jobs linked with employer account
information (Abowd, 2009). The LEHD jobs frame consists of Unemployment Insurance covered
employment, which is the same domain as the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and inclusive
of the vast majority of wage and salary jobs (Stevens, 2007). The Person History File, a component of the
Infrastructure Files, provides quarterly earnings of a person at an employer within a state, as well as
observed or imputed assignments to establishments at an employer. The Employer Characteristics File
gives establishment location, size, and industry. Information on characteristics of individuals in the LEHD,
including age, comes from the Individual Characteristics File (ICF), which is compiled at the Census

9

Bureau from Decennial Censuses and from federal administrative data sources. 7 We also use longitudinal
information on where individuals have lived (whether they are employed or not) that comes from a
confidential dataset called the Composite Person Record (CPR). The CPR, also derived from administrative
data, reports an annual place of residence for individuals (Graham et al., 2017). It is this unique
combination of administrative records on residential address and workplace information for individuals that
enables us to calculate our network measures NIcW and NIcP.
Given that our research is cross-sectional in nature, we use information for only the year 2010 to
construct the network measures, as that year corresponds most closely to the rest of our data. (Some of the
other aggregate Census data is used to construct social capital measures or potential controls, as discussed
below.) We extract home and workplace information for workers at approximately 110 million primary
jobs that were active on April 1, 2010, where a primary job is defined as the highest earning job that a
person holds. 8,9 We use draws from an imputation model that assigns establishments to workers in the case
of employers with multiple units within a state, where such assignments are uncertain. 10 While the
uncertainty represented by this imputation would tend to reduce our estimates of network isolation at the
neighborhood level, our previous research using LEHD has found that the relative differences in

7
The Social Security Administration’s Numident file provides sex, date of birth, place of birth, citizenship, and race.
The 2000 Census short and long forms provide age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, and national origin. The ICF
combines these sources, where observed, and imputes values for the rest. The ICF can be linked to the LEHD earnings
records using personal identifying information.
8
We use the Person History Enhanced Across SEIN and Non-SEIN Transitions (PHEASANT) process to consolidate
state level Person History Files. The PHEASANT takes successor/predecessor transitions of employers into account
when calculating a worker’s job spell duration and earnings at an employer.
9
Because we only observe employment on a quarterly basis, we define a job as held on April 1 if we observe the
worker to work with a given employer in both the first and second quarters of the year, based on the inference that
jobs held with the same employer in both quarters are most likely also active on April 1. This follows the definition
used in LEHD public-use data products of instantaneous counts of jobs. Our definition of employment omits those
who were not employed by the same employer over the two quarters, even if they worked in both quarters; these
individuals may have had job-to-job transitions or periods of non-employment.
10
Most states do not require employers to assign workers to a particular establishment. For workers at multi-unit
employers (about 44 percent of all jobs), or jobs where the reporting firm has multiple establishments in the same
state, we make use of the imputation model developed by the LEHD program to allocate establishments to workers
(Abowd, 2009). For the set of active establishments during a worker’s tenure, the model attempts to replicate the size
distribution of establishments and the observed distribution of commute distances. Although the model makes ten
imputation draws for each job, which are equally weighted for the production of small area statistics in public-use
data, we use only the first such draw.

10

networking across groups are not affected by using the imputation. 11 Following the methods described
above and using home and workplace information for each job, we calculate NIic for each worker, and then
average these by the Census-tract residence count of the same set of workers to compute NIcW, and by the
Census-tract count of all persons age 19 to 64 in administrative records to compute NIcP.
III. Social Capital Measures and Potential Controls
Because we use a Census tract-level measure of neighborhood labor-market connectedness, we also
need to construct measures of social capital that vary by Census tract in order to learn about the relationship
between labor market networks and neighborhood social capital. The measures of social capital that we use
come almost exclusively from non-LEHD data sources that we have merged at the Census tract level with
our LEHD data.
The first of these additional data are the 5-year estimates from the 2008-2012 American
Community Survey (ACS). We extract from the ACS a vector of Census tract economic and demographic
characteristics that are known to be related to labor market outcomes and to socioeconomic characteristics
of communities more generally. The demographic characteristics include: the share of tract residents in
poverty; the share of tract-residents who live in owner-occupied housing; the share of tract residents who
are Hispanic; the share black non-Hispanic; the share Asian non-Hispanic; the share non-U.S. born; the
share currently married; and the share in various education categories (less than high school; share with
high school degree or some college; and share with at least a bachelor’s degree). 12
There are three reasons to include these demographic variables in the analysis. First, for our
network measure NIcP, individuals who are not employed contribute a value of zero to the tract average.
Their non-employment is partially predicted by demographic variables (such as educational attainment),
and so including these demographic variables helps control for important features of labor market success.

11

Hellerstein et al. (2014) find that observed network isolation tends to be lower for samples including multi-unit
employers, likely due to noise from the imputation, though variation in observed NI across subsets of the data has
similar patterns in both single- and multi-unit samples. For example, in Hellerstein et al. (2014), whites have almost
double the observed NI as blacks in both single-unit jobs and all-jobs samples.
12
While the 2008-2012 ACS is reported in 2010 Census tract geography, statistics for four urbanized 2010 Census
tracts were not reported by the ACS and are dropped from our sample.

11

Second, even for the network measure NIcW that excludes the non-employed, previous research (e.g.
Hellerstein et al., 2011 and 2014) clearly demonstrates variation among the employed in the importance of
neighborhood networks across race, ethnicity, and education groups, because, for example, labor markets
(and hence neighborhood-based networks) are more local for less-skilled labor, and because of a greater
reliance of immigrants on network connections (Portes, 1998). The third reason to include these controls as
candidates in our machine learning algorithm is that there is evidence that demographic characteristics are
key to producing social capital and social trust (Alesina and La Ferrera, 2002; Rupasingha, 2006; and
Putnam, 2007). The home ownership rate may be thought of as a measure of social stability and also as an
indicator of lower residential density, which has been found to be associated with greater interaction
between neighbors (Brueckner and Largey, 2008).
We also extract and use two commuting-related variables from the ACS, aggregated to Census
tract-level rates. First, we construct a measure of the fraction of employed local residents whose commutes
to work are less than 10 minutes, treating this as a measure of local job access. If there are many nearby
jobs, employment rates are likely to be higher (Ihlanfeldt, 2006; Zenou, 2008), and neighborhood residents
may work together not because of networks but simply because of job access. The second variable we
construct is the fraction of the employed who commute to work by driving alone. Lone commutes suggest
that neighbors are not working at similar locations (or at the same establishment), which can reflect the
geographic dispersion of employment opportunities for residents of a given Census tract or a lack of transit
options. Note, though, that this could also potentially be a measure of social capital, as residents
commuting together (by carpool or public transit) may share job information.13
We construct a second set of Census tract-level measures to capture various dimensions of local
schools, which we view as potentially related to social capital. These measures enable us to ask whether
neighborhood social capital that is school-based also translates into more networked labor markets. We first

13
Zenou (2013) argues that spatial distances can create social distances, where workers who engage in long commutes
forfeit the opportunity to expand their social network because of driving time’s opportunity costs. If so-called “weak
ties” – ties outside of immediate family and friends – can improve job matching, then it stands to reason that driving
alone can also be forfeiting opportunity to expand one’s social ties.

then assign to each Census tract characteristics of the school district in which it falls, obtaining school-level
characteristics from the Department of Education’s Common Core of Data. School districts often cover
multiple Census tracts, in which case all Census tracts in the district are assigned the same school-level
variables. When school district boundaries bisect a Census tract, the tract is assigned school-level variables
that reflect a weighted average of the characteristics of the school districts it serves, with the weight being
the fraction of land area in the Census tract covered by the district.
The school district variables we construct are: the average student-teacher ratio; the share of
students in the schools on free or reduced-price lunch; the number of different districts to which students in
the Census tract are assigned; and the average number of Census tracts served by the school districts in a
tract (which in the case of one district covering the entire tract is simply the number of tracts that district
serves). Higher student-teacher ratios and the number of students in the school on free/reduced-price lunch
may reflect school districts where parents do not have resources to invest in social capital via the local
schools. Our measure of the number of different districts to which students in living in a tract are assigned
could be viewed in one of two ways. It could be negatively related to the extent to which schools are
strongly community based, if when a tract is divided into many districts, the residents of the tract are less
likely to interact with each other at their children’s school. On the other hand, it could be an indicator of
small school districts in which parents interact more, thus fostering social capital at more local levels. Our
related measure – of the number of tracts served by the school – is meant to capture how large the school
district or districts in the tract are. We view this measure as unambiguously measuring the size of school
districts, which we expect to be negatively related to social capital (paralleling the second interpretation of
the number of districts variable).
A third set of covariates we construct to use in predicting NIcW and NIcP reflects voting patterns at
the Census tract level. We view these measures as motivated directly by the social capital literature cited

14

We use school district boundaries. In states with non-unified school districts, these may be elementary school
boundaries. While elementary school boundaries might be more relevant with regard to parent interaction (and hence
social capital), data on elementary district boundaries were much sparser.

earlier. We generated a dataset of 2008 presidential voting results by 2010 Census tracts using the Harvard
Election Data Archive (HEDA, Ansolabehere et al., 2014). HEDA’s publicly available files allow us to
match precinct-level voting results to Census Voting Districts (VTDs), and a Census Bureau crosswalk
between VTDs and Census geography at the Census block level allows us to overlay VTDs onto Census
tracts. We construct three Census tract-level variables from the HEDA data: the fraction of the voting age
population in the Census tract that voted in the 2008 presidential election; the fraction that voted for the
Democratic candidate in 2008 (among those voting for either the Republican or Democratic candidates);
and the fraction of votes cast for the candidate of the party winning the majority of votes in the tract. Note
that we do not principally interpret these voting-derived variables as reflecting outcomes associated with
the policies supported by one group or another. Rather, we view them as descriptors of a neighborhood’s
population and social behavior. To this end, we also note that Census tracts do not necessarily conform to
local or Congressional electoral boundaries, and that we include state fixed effects in some specifications,
which would sweep out the influence of any related influence from governance at the state level.
Finally, we use data from the 2013 NETS to construct Census tract-level measures of counts of
establishments in the non-profit sector (which can include government institutions) such as libraries,
churches, civic associations, and community centers, which might facilitate the social capital that builds
labor market networks. The NETS is a database that contains address information, employment
information, and NAICS industry codes for essentially the universe of establishments in the United States
(for more information, see Neumark et al., 2007). To align with our other data, we use observations on
establishments for the year 2010.
The NETS is constructed by Walls & Associates from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) data. 15 The NETS
is based on D&B’s Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Marketing Information (DMI) file for each
year. The primary purpose of D&B’s data collection effort is to provide information on businesses to the
business community, by constructing a set of “predictive indicators” (e.g., the D&B rating and Paydex

15

scores), and for marketing purposes. The DMI file for each year is constructed from an ongoing effort to
capture each business establishment in the United States in each year, including nonprofits and the public
sector. The NETS is a longitudinal file that links DMI files, although we do not exploit the longitudinal
dimension in this paper.
The DMI files underlying the NETS are based on a multi-layered process incorporating many data
sources, in which D&B uses a massive data collection effort to try to identify and assemble information on
all business establishments. This includes over 100 million telephone calls from four calling centers each
year, as well as information from legal and court filings, newspapers and electronic news services, public
utilities, all Secretaries of State, government registries and licensing data, payment and collections
information, company filings, and the U.S. postal service. One highly desirable feature of the NETS
database is that it covers essentially all establishments. This reflects the fact that it is designed to capture
the universe rather than a sample of establishments.
Unlike the LEHD, the NETS potentially has complete coverage of non-profit establishments,
which makes it a better data source for capturing this type of social capital. Non-profits with no
employment would not appear in LEHD, and even some employers, such as religious schools in some
states, are exempt from Unemployment Insurance law and do not appear in the LEHD (Stevens, 2007). 16
Non-profits serve many different community functions such as providing public goods (e.g.,
neighborhood watch associations) or facilitating social interaction (athletic clubs), or both (Kiwanis clubs).
The LASSO estimation’s results can, in principle, help establish whether labor market networks are
correlated with public goods provision (“better” neighborhoods yield stronger networks) or easier social
interaction (more meeting opportunities yield stronger networks), although in practice it is not
straightforward to classify establishments in the non-profit sector as playing one role or the other.
While the NETS captures all types of business establishments, we draw on past research and theory

16

In Illinois, for example, the state code (820 ILCS 405/211.3, ch. 48, par. 321.3 says: “For the purpose of Section
211.2, the term “employment” shall not include services performed—A. In the employ of (1) a church or convention
or association of churches, or (2) an organization or school which is not an institution of higher education, which is
operated primarily for religious purposes and which is operated, supervised, controlled or principally supported by a
church or convention or association of churches.”

15

on social capital that focuses on the non-profit sector. The NETS includes an indicator for legal status that
identifies non-profits. However, this field is missing in about one-half of cases. Hence, rather than flagging
specific establishments as non-profits, we instead flag all NAICS 6-digit industries in which at least 10
percent of establishments with this field non-missing are coded as non-profits, and we use all the
establishments in these industries in order to classify where non-profits – and potential social capital – are
located. Note that our definition is quite broad, in that we use a (rather low) threshold in defining an
industry as being “non-profit,” and we use counts of all establishments in the industry as a measure of the
intensity of activity in the industry. We use this rather expansive view of where non-profits – and
potentially for-profits that engage in the same activities – can generate social capital as a starting point. We
then deploy LASSO to let the data tell us whether and where our criterion for defining the non-profit sector
is too broad in the sense of not fostering social capital that leads to stronger labor market networks.
The NETS in many cases has either the establishment’s exact geo-coordinates or the Census block
group or tract where it is located. We use Geographic Information System (GIS) software to map
establishments in the NETS to Census tracts. In each Census tract, we construct counts of establishments in
each of the 6-digit NAICS categories we have identified as an industry with high non-profit concentration.
It is important to emphasize that our social capital measures are local measures. As such, our
results should be interpreted as reflecting the effects of local social capital on the strength of neighborhood
labor market networks. There could be social capital created by non-profits at a less local level that
facilitate sharing of information about jobs, such as government-run websites for either private or public
jobs. 17 And some of the businesses or institutions in the non-profit sector that we study may play this role at
a more aggregate level than the Census tract.
IV. Machine Learning: LASSO
To examine the relationship between our social capital measures and our local labor market
network measure, we utilize a machine learning algorithm known as LASSO (Townsend, 2017). 18 LASSO

17

See, for example, https://www.usajobs.gov/ (viewed December 4, 2017).
Townsend’s method is itself a STATA implementation of the recommended LASSO algorithm developed in
Friedman et al. (2010).
18

16

is not the only machine learning algorithm that we could use to select social capital measures, but we think
it will yield a better-fitted model to the data than its two main alternatives, ridge regressions and pretesting.
As detailed in Abadie and Kasy (2018), ridge regressions fit models best when most regressors are
expected to have non-zero coefficients, while pretesting fits best when most potential coefficients are
expected to be set to zero (called high sparsity). LASSO fits best in intermediate cases where there is a high
degree of sparsity, but where one wants to avoid an overly aggressive assumption on the number of
coefficients being set to zero. LASSO is also appropriate in cases like ours where the literature is somewhat
ambiguous on the breadth of institutions that might instigate some network-based social capital: there are
good reasons to think that a significant set will have no impact, but there are many possible variables (in
our case, social capital measures) for which we are estimating coefficients (Abadie and Kasy, 2018).
The key to understanding LASSO starts by examining the objective function when seeking to
estimate a vector of parameters β (Tibshirani, 1996):
(4)

𝑝𝑝
𝑝𝑝
𝛽𝛽̂ = argmin ∑𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐=1(𝑦𝑦𝑐𝑐 − Σ𝑙𝑙=1 𝑥𝑥𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑏𝑏𝑙𝑙 )2 + 𝜆𝜆 ∑𝑙𝑙=1|𝑏𝑏𝑙𝑙 |.
𝑏𝑏

Note that the first term on the right-hand side of the equation is the usual Ordinary Least Squares
(OLS) objective function – minimizing the sum of squared errors when given a linear equation relating a
dependent variable y to a vector of observable variables x (tract level observations are denoted by c, and
regressors by l). 19 When researchers do not have strong priors as to which observable characteristics belong
in the vector x, and especially when the set of possible x’s is large (and perhaps even larger than the sample
size) – so that there is a risk of “over-fitting” – LASSO serves as a covariate reduction technique where the
data guide the researcher as to the set of observable characteristics among those in x that best belong in the
regression. As such, the second term on the right-hand side is a penalty function, where the penalty factor 𝜆𝜆

is selected by the LASSO algorithm. 20 The LASSO estimation procedure identifies the set of parameters

19
For concreteness, in our context, yc is the network measure (NIcW or NIcP) at the Census tract level c, and xcl is the
vector of potential contributors to a high observed level of network connectedness.
20
There are many different methods for calibrating 𝜆𝜆, but the Townsend (2017) implementation uses cross-validation.
In cross-validation, the sample is randomly split into several, equal-sized “folds.” On K−1 of the folds, the coefficients
and penalty factor are calculated, and then on the kth fold, they are applied as a validation exercise to calculate the
out-of-sample error. Repeating this exercise leaving out one fold each time, the penalty factor that minimizes the outof-sample error is chosen to be reapplied to the entire sample.

17

that best predict the data under the assumption that all other coefficients of the other possible regressors
should be set to zero; that is, the LASSO-reported coefficients are artificially shrunken, with some going to
zero, to keep the number of predictors small. The final step (post-LASSO estimation procedure) is to then
estimate an OLS regression using only the restricted set of covariates as regressors, which “restores” the
proper coefficient values on the selected regressors (Belloni and Chernozhukov, 2013). 21
The candidate x variables that we have collected and grouped into four categories as described
above are: demographic and commuting variables; school-district variables; voting pattern variables; and
non-profit penetration in the Census tract. We sometimes include two other variables in our LASSO
algorithm. One is what we call a “transport isolation index” (similar to Hellerstein et al., 2014). This
variable is intended to control for differences in transportation infrastructure that can generate variation in
our network measures even when there is no actual sharing of information of the type that underlies
network models. For example, transportation infrastructure in an area (like a highway or subway line)
might lead to many people from one tract of residence working in a common tract, which can lead some of
them to work in the same establishment simply for this reason. To allow for the possibility that observed
network isolation is the result of commuting tendencies rather than interpersonal connections, we construct
transport isolation measures corresponding to each networking measure, which we label TIcW and TIcP. We
compute these on a per worker and per person basis from 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (as with NIic in Equation 1), which gives the

share of total workers in an employment tract who reside in the same tract as that worker – i.e., who have
the same origin and destination tracts in their commute. In this way, the transport isolation indices are
constructed in an identical manner as the network measures, following Equations 2 and 3, except that we

use the workplace Census tract rather than the establishment. But while the transport index may be higher
in some Census tracts because of the availability of local transportation infrastructure, it may alternatively

21

A LASSO regression induces shrinkage on the coefficients, relative to what the same coefficient estimates would be
under OLS. Performing OLS after model selection has the virtue of eliminating the shrinkage bias while achieving
similar convergence properties as the LASSO itself. This result is somewhat dependent on the LASSO selecting an
appropriately “sparse” model – i.e., a model where the number of selected variables is small relative to the number of
candidate variables. However, even if model does not achieve sparsity, running OLS after LASSO still retains the
virtue of eliminating the shrinkage bias.

18

be high in those tracts because of social capital in a neighborhood that leads neighbors to work in the same
neighborhoods. If it is the latter, the transportation index, like the network isolation index itself, is an
outcome, and including it in the estimation could “over-control” for the determinants of our network
measure.
The second potential control is the simple count of all NETS establishments operating in the
neighborhood Census tract, regardless of industry classification. The number of establishments in a Census
tract can be correlated with the network index mechanically because it can lead to clusters of neighbors
working together due to geographical proximity, and thus may be an important control in the regression.
Alternatively, the number of these establishments actually may be a measure of social capital, if, for
example, local zoning laws lead to land being allocated to a large number of small establishments, versus
restricting the local area to residential use or a few, large employers.
Finally, in order to control for state fixed effects, in some models we first “residualize” both the
dependent variable and all the candidate social capital measures by regressing each of them individually on
the fixed effects (Frisch and Waugh, 1933; Lovell, 1963). We then run the LASSO procedure on the
residualized variables, effectively partialling out the state fixed effects, and using only the remaining
within-state variation in those models. For all of the variables we include in the models (with the exception
of the state fixed effects), we allow the LASSO procedure to pick the variables that remain, and then we reestimate the model using OLS with just these variables. Both the variable selection and the ensuing
estimated coefficients tell us whether and which of the social capital proxies are related to neighborhood
labor market networks.
One current limitation of LASSO is that conducting proper inference can be challenging.
Computing standard errors from LASSO coefficients themselves is non-trivial, because the LASSO
function is a non-linear and non-differentiable function, even when λ is fixed (Tibshirani, 1996). PostLASSO OLS coefficients, while computable, do not incorporate the fact that the first-stage of the LASSO
preselects the covariates (x’s) for the second stage. That is, each coefficient’s distribution for these is
� = 𝑀𝑀, where 𝑀𝑀
� is the OLS regression model selected out of all
conditional on both the covariates and on 𝑀𝑀
19

the possible candidate OLS models M that could come out of the first stage LASSO. We deal with this in
two different ways. First, we report the usual OLS standard errors, disregarding the model selection from
the LASSO. This should result in standard errors that are too small. In most OLS applications, this would
be a problem, and in our context, what this means in practice is that we might incorrectly infer that too
many social capital measures are related to our labor market network measure than is actually the case. But
given that the LASSO procedure excludes many of our candidate social capital measures to begin with, and
given that we interpret our results with appropriate caution, we are not too concerned about this.
Nonetheless, we also report 95-percent confidence intervals on our OLS estimates as constructed
using a second method. In a recent paper, Lee et al. (2016) (hereafter, LSST) showed that under the
assumption that the error term in the second-stage regression model is normally distributed, conditioning on
� = 𝑀𝑀 gives the estimated coefficients a truncated normal distribution. They outline an algorithm for
𝑀𝑀
finding the left and right truncation points of that distribution, which we implement to create adjusted

confidence intervals for the coefficient estimates. We note that these confidence intervals also are only an
approximation for two reasons. First, the set of candidate models M is defined by assuming we have
included in the LASSO all possible social capital measures that may be related to our network measure.
Second, LSST’s results rely on an assumption of normality, which in our setting is clearly only an
approximation since our network measure is actually bounded. In practice, it turns out that the statistical
inferences are nearly identical using these two methods, indicating that the OLS standard errors are likely
not problematic.
The fact that the results of the LASSO procedure do not necessarily yield causal evidence does not
trouble us. There simply is a scarcity of wide-scale evidence that ties labor market network strength to local
organizations and characteristics that are typically associated with social capital. That said, it is important
to note that one cannot draw policy conclusions from these associations, such as whether, for example,
increasing the presence of non-profit sector establishments would boost labor market networks.
V. Results
Descriptive statistics

20

Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for all our variables with the exception of the tabulations of
establishments in the non-profit sector in the NETS. Our sample of approximately 34,000 Census tracts is
determined by our urban area restriction as well as limitations due to data availability. 22 Our network
measures are calculated over 48.3 million workers whose highest earning job is at one of 3.3 million unique
employers located at one of 4 million unique establishments. The mean of the observed network isolation
index NIc is about 1.6 when we calculate it using only workers (which we denote NIcW); 23 it falls to about
1.0 when we include the non-employed in the calculation (which we denote NIcP), who by definition have
NIic = 0. The average transport isolation measures – 0.59 for workers and 0.37 for the population – are
significantly lower than observed network isolation, which is consistent with labor markets being more
networked than what might be anticipated from location factors alone. 24
In interpreting the means of the demographic and education variables, recall that these are
computed over tracts, and are for urban tracts only. Thus, these means are not representative of the U.S.
population. In the last panel, the schooling and voting variables reveal that most tracts include only one
school district (the mean is about 1.33). The high Democratic vote share is a reflection of the selection on
urban tracts. The high majority vote share (0.68) points to considerable homogeneity in voting.
Table 2 reports information from the NETS on all 90 of the 6-digit NAICS industries with at least
10 percent of establishments coded as non-profits, drawn from the universe of establishments with non-

22

Starting with the U.S. total of 73,057 Census tracts, we first limit to the 44,127 that are classified as fully urban and
in a state where LEHD jobs data was available in 2010 (we exclude 1,267 tracts in Massachusetts and the District of
Columbia). We also exclude the small number of tracts that do not have at least 100 residents with LEHD earnings.
Linking to the voting and schooling data further limits the sample to (approximately) 34,000, with the voting data
being more restrictive. Census tracts have a target population of 4,000 residents, with the 25th, 50th, and 75th
percentiles of our tracts, by population, having 2,886, 3,966, and 5,190 persons, respectively. Given this similar sizing
and the nature of our evaluation, we do not weight our estimates by population, so each Census tract serves as an
observation.
23
This is lower, by a factor of about three, than in Hellerstein et al. (2014). The differences arise due to the restriction
to urban tracts in this paper, and the inclusion of multi-unit establishments. Hellerstein et al. (2011 and 2014) present a
scaled version of this network measure (averaged across all workers) that subtracts out the clustering of neighbors in
establishments that can occur randomly, and computes this difference relative to the maximum clustering that can
occur. This adjustment is less important in the present paper, where we are more interested in explaining variation in
the network measure than in asking “how important” networks are in an absolute sense.
24
Moreover, the 1.6 figure for NIcW (for example) should not be interpreted relative to 100 percent, but relative to the
maximum amount of clustering that could occur; this is much lower, because given the size distribution of firms, all
neighbors typically could not work at the same establishment as any given reference person.

21

missing legal status (see the on-line appendix for full descriptions of each industry). The entries are ordered
in terms of NAICS codes. The maximum percentage of establishments coded as non-profits is above 50
percent (for NAICS code 813219), and is high for industries including charities, humane societies, hospitals
and clinics, athletic associations, rehab facilities, etc.
We can imagine that some of these are more likely to be associated with higher social capital that
might be tied to labor market networks (e.g., churches, places of worship, etc., NAICS code 813110, and
civic associations, NAICS code 813410), others might be tied to social capital but play little role in labor
market networks (e.g., activity centers for disabled persons, NAICS code 624120), and others might be
weakly connected to social capital in the first place (e.g., apartment and condominium management,
NAICS code 531311). However, rather than try to pre-specify which industries are likely to facilitate the
kind of social capital that builds labor market networks, we use our machine learning approach to identify
these industries (as well as to select among the other potential social capital variables we constructed).
Although we have not yet discussed the estimation results, Table 2 provides a preview, as we indicate in
boldface industries (or a subset of the full NAICS definition) that are retained in at least some of our
LASSO estimations. We later describe and summarize the industries that, according to our LASSO
estimations, increase labor market network connections.
Preliminary regressions
As preliminary evidence, Table 3 reports results of regressions for the two versions of our network
measure – NIcW and NIcP – including the demographic controls, the other controls, and the social capital
measures (e.g., the school district and voting variables) that are based on prior research. We use simple
OLS in this table and not LASSO, and we just include this smaller set of potential social capital measures
(and not the non-profit sector establishment counts). The specifications vary with respect to whether the
tract-level isolation index and establishment counts are included, and whether or not we include state fixed
effects, and for each version of the dependent variable we first report results with the social capital
measures excluded.
The estimated coefficients on the demographic variables are a bit hard to interpret, since the

22

variables can be quite strongly related. For example, both the share of tract residents living in poverty and
the fraction black are each strongly positively correlated with our observed network isolation index and
with each other, but the estimated coefficients on these variables in Table 3, while both generally
statistically significant, are often opposite in sign. The estimate of a higher network measure where the
share of immigrants (non-natives) is higher is consistent with past findings on immigrants, language, and
the importance of networks (e.g., Hellerstein et al., 2011). The education results sometimes indicate that the
observed network measure is highest where the share with low education is highest, consistent with lesseducated workers participating in more local labor markets. The positive effect of the share with a
bachelor’s degree (or higher) in most specifications (relative to high school graduates or those with some
college – the omitted group), suggests that the more highly-educated also have good network connections –
perhaps more so because of access to social capital than the local nature of their labor market.
With regard to the commuting variables, tracts with shorter commutes appear to be more
networked. However, this likely is due to some extent to a higher density of jobs nearby, which is
consistent with the finding that the estimated effect of the short-commute variable declines by more than
three-quarters when the transport isolation index is included (in columns (3), (4), (7), and (8)). Commuting
by driving alone is associated with lower values of NIcW and NIcP. 25
We also find that our network measure is higher when residential mobility is lower (where
residential mobility – or lack thereof – is captured by the share of residents that did not move in the
previous year). There is also evidence, especially in the specifications including the tract-level isolation
index and the establishment counts, that NIcW and NIcP are also higher when the share of housing that is
owner-occupied is higher. Both results may simply reflect the fact that residential mobility and home
ownership rates are measures of socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods. But it is worth noting that
both results also are consistent with more sharing of labor market information between neighbors when
neighbors are more likely to know each other – whether somewhat mechanically because they are likely to

25

Whether one drives to work alone can also be interpreted as a reflection of network connections among neighbors,
raising the possibility that including this variable subsumes other network effects. However, all of our estimated
relationships with network-related measures were changed only negligibly by excluding this variable.

23

have been at the same address longer, or perhaps also because homeowners interact with neighbors in a
variety of ways that renters do not.
The bottom rows of the table report results for the schooling- and voting-related social capital
measures. The estimated signs of the effects of the schooling variables are consistent with our expectations.
Census tracts with more school districts (which may be a proxy for smaller school districts) appear more
networked. Similarly, tracts with smaller school districts – which serve fewer tracts – are also more
networked, and tracts where school districts report smaller average class sizes – which may have to do
more with school size – are more networked. With regard to the voting variables, it appears that more
homogeneous voting and voter turnout are positively correlated with NIcW and NIcP, while tracts with a
larger Democratic vote share seem to have less-extensive labor market networks. 26
LASSO regressions
In Table 4 we turn to the LASSO estimates. These are the specifications into which we introduce
the counts of non-profit establishments by industry, and allow the data-driven machine learning algorithm
to determine which social capital variables (and other variables) belong in the OLS regression. We report
estimates from six specifications. First, using NIcW – the network measure that is constructed using only
workers – we show results excluding and then including (potentially, if chosen by LASSO) the tract-level
isolation index and establishment count, and for each of these cases, excluding and then including (via
residualization) the state fixed effects. Then, using NIcP, the network measure based on population, we
repeat the specifications including the tract-level isolation index and establishment count (both because
these are selected by LASSO, and are strongly significant), with and without fixed state effects. The
specifications including the transport isolation measures, which are also sensitive to employment, should
help to control for employment-related effects on our networking measure (though transport isolation may
also over-control, as hiring to the same location, even if not the same firm, may also be a product of
networks).

26

Recall the earlier discussion of the local nature of our social capital measures. It may be that a higher Democratic
vote share is associated with popular support for institutions that provide social capital at a more aggregate level.

24

The first panel of the table covers the demographic and commuting controls. One interesting result
is that the estimates for these variables are not very different from those in the corresponding specifications
in Table 3, and the variables generally not selected by LASSO are those whose effects in Table 3 were
quite small, with only a couple of exceptions.
The second panel covers the potential schooling and voting social capital variables. LASSO retains
the variables related to number of districts and the Democratic vote share in all specifications. At the other
extreme, voter turnout is retained in only one specification. The estimated magnitudes of the schooling and
voting variables are similar to Table 3, and the signs are always the same. Thus, the estimates indicate that
neighborhoods with smaller districts and schools are more networked, as are neighborhoods where fewer
schoolchildren qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. The majority vote share results indicate that more
politically homogeneous neighborhoods – on this metric – have stronger labor market networks. And again,
a higher Democratic vote share lessens labor market network connections.
The last set of results – which begin below the schooling and voting variables – pertain to the
counts of non-profit establishments in the 90 industries with a large share of such establishments. 27
Comparing column (1) to column (3), column (2) to column (4), and column (2’) to column (4’) indicates
that there are many industries that are selected by the LASSO procedure whether or not we include fixed
state effects. Similarly, comparing column (1) to column (2), and column (3) to column (4) – and the same
is true for NIcP – indicates that many of the same industries are retained whether or not the tract-level
isolation index and the establishment counts are included as potential controls.
Among the industries in which the count of non-profit sector establishments is often retained and
the estimated coefficient is positive and statistically significant, many seem like natural or even
stereotypical types of establishments that would foster social capital in one of a number of ways. This list
includes the following: 28

27

The order of the industries is the same as in Table 2, sorted by NAICS codes.
Note that we use a subset of all the industry definitions from Table 2, chosen to try to best characterize the NAICS
industry. One has to exercise caution in characterizing these industries, as the on-line appendix indicates that for some
NAICS codes there is a much longer list of business types within the code.

charitable trusts (NAICS code 813211)

•

hobby clubs, civic associations, Scouts, PTAs, etc. (NAICS code 813410)

•

labor unions (NAICS code 813930), and

•

fire and rescue services, including volunteer fire departments (NAICS code 922160).
These types of non-profits picked out by the LASSO procedure seem to be those likely to

encourage contacts between neighbors. For example, country clubs may generate contacts between those
who work in related jobs and share social contacts, given that there may be significant socioeconomic
homogeneity. And in the case of schools, the contacts seem likely to be between parents with children,
paralleling, to some extent, evidence suggesting that labor market network connections between neighbors
are stronger among neighbors with school-age children of similar ages (Bayer et al., 2008, Table 7).
There are other non-profit establishments that are retained with significant positive coefficients and
which could also foster social capital, although perhaps less directly with regard to communication among
neighbors. These include industries such as: ambulance and rescue services (NAICS code 621910); nursing
homes (NAICS code 623110); city and mayors’ office (NAICS code 921110); and police departments
(NAICS code 922120), These industries might be best characterized as providing public goods, in which
case a high establishment count may reflect decentralization, with Census tracts in smaller municipalities or
those where service provision is more disaggregated being more likely to have their own facilities. In that
case, the local presence of these public goods facilities may be a more indirect indicator of communities
that are smaller, with more community involvement and monitoring (e.g., Ostrom, 1990), and hence more

26

ties that can enhance labor market networks.
Finally, to be sure, there are some findings – especially negative ones – that seem harder to
interpret. The industries with persistent negative effects include: distribution of electric power (NAICS
code 221122); social science research and development services (NAICS code 541720); fundraising
campaign organization services (NAICS code 561499); humane societies (NAICS code 813312);
professional associations (NAICS code 813920); campaign organizations (NAICS code 813940);
homeowners’ associations (NAICS code 813990); and arts/cultural or economic development
administration (NAICS code 926110). One possible explanation of these latter findings is that these kinds
of industries are associated with hiring that tends not to be local (such as government jobs, or professional
jobs).
We cannot explain all of our findings, and indeed we did not expect to be able to do so. We are,
after all, using a machine learning algorithm that picks out predictors of our network measures, and we
have not imposed theoretical constraints or priors on the potential predictors (other than restricting to
establishments in industries with a higher share of non-profits). Overall, however, we regard the industries
selected by the LASSO procedure that are positively associated with either the worker-based network
measure (NIcW) or the population-based network measure (NIcP) as broadly supportive of the idea that nonprofits that foster interaction between residents facilitate the development of social capital that helps create
labor market connections among neighbors. To provide the reader with a better sense of this result, Table 5
lists the full NAICS definitions for the industries with positive (and significant) effects in five or more
specifications in the LASSO estimates reported in Table 4.
The magnitudes of the estimated relationships between some of our social capital measures are
non-trivial. For example, in column (3) of Table 4, the estimated coefficient on hobby clubs, Scouts, PTAs,
etc. (NAICS code 813410) is 0.0224. In Table 6, we show the standard deviations of the non-profit sector
counts; for this industry, the standard deviation is 1.939. Thus, a one standard deviation change would
increase NIcW by about 0.0434, and given a mean of NIcW of 1.609, the implied effect is about 2.7 percent.
The implied effects is about twice as larger for churches, mosques, synagogues, etc. (NAICS code 813110);

27

the estimated coefficient in column (3) is about the same magnitude, but the standard deviation is twice as
large. Similarly, although the estimated coefficient for country clubs and golf courses (NAICS codes
713910) is much larger (e.g., 0.173 in column (3)), the standard deviation is much lower (0.337), leading to
a similar size effect.
In contrast, the implied effects of some of the sectors that have negative effects on the network
measures are smaller. For example, the implied effect of establishments in the distribution of electric power
(NAICS code 221122) in column (2) is 0.0162, and the implied effect for establishments in campaign
organizations, etc. (NAICS code 813940) in column (3) is 0.0187. Indeed, the average standard deviation is
more than 50 percent larger (0.22 versus 0.13) for industries with a positive effect on the network measures
than for industries with a negative effect, based on Table 6.
We note that the list of industries with positive estimated effects on our network measures are not
simply the industries that are have the highest share of non-profits or, alternatively, the largest industries
with a non-profit component (as specified in the NETS – see the % Non-Profit and Total Estab.’s fields,
respectively, in Table 2 and the on-line appendix). Such a finding might have been consistent with nonprofits simply being a byproduct of social largesse (in that they must operate on a non-profit basis), which
might be related to our networking measure, or an indication that only the largest and most widespread
types of non-profits have a discernable statistical relationship with our networking measure. Of the fifteen
industries with the highest non-profit reporting share (see Table 2), only one – charitable trusts and
community foundations (NAICS code 813211) – appears consistently with positive effects on our network
measures (see Table 5). The industry with the greatest share non-profit, community chests (NAICS code
813219), has no discernable effect on labor market networks in any specification.
VI. Conclusions
Our goal in this paper is to conduct empirical analyses to identify characteristics of neighborhoods
(Census tracts) that may facilitate the development of social capital leading to variation, across
neighborhoods, in the extent of labor market networking among neighbors. We draw on prior literature,
mainly on social capital, to construct neighborhood-level measures of social capital of various kinds,

28

focused primarily on characteristics of schools and school districts, and of voting behavior. In addition, we
measure the prevalence in neighborhoods of businesses/institutions concentrated in the non-profit sector
that are likely to increase social capital and network ties. We use machine learning methods to let the data
tell us which of these measures help predict neighborhood variation in a measure of neighborhood-based
labor markets that we have used in past research, which both captures potential network connections among
neighbors, and is associated with good job market matches and better labor market outcomes.
With regard to schooling and voting, our analysis suggests that schools that are likely smaller and
in less centralized school districts foster social capital that builds labor market networks, as does a larger
Republican vote share, which we interpret as a population characteristic. Among industries with a
reasonable share of non-profits, a number are identified as predictive of strong labor market networks, and
these industries do, in fact, seem to us to likely play this role via either public goods provision or
facilitating social contacts. These industries include: churches and other religious institutions, police
departments, fire and rescue services including volunteer fire departments, country clubs, mayors’ offices,
chamber music groups, hobby clubs, and museums. For many of these, it seems plausible to think that
people working or looking for work may develop relationships that lead to sharing of labor market
information among neighbors and among employers. Overall, we regard the industries selected by the
LASSO procedure as broadly supportive of the idea that establishments in the non-profit sector are
successful at fostering interactions between residents that build social capital to create labor market
connections among neighbors.
VII. Discussion
There is a long-standing interest in social capital in sociology, political science, and economics,
and a burgeoning interest in labor market networks in both sociology and economics. We believe our study
contributes to and strengthens this literature in four significant ways. Most important, we connect the two,
asking how neighborhood levels of social capital are linked to the strength of local labor market networks.
Second, we draw on a new data set to construct novel measures of social capital based on the
representation, in the neighborhood, of businesses in the non-profit sector. Third, given the multiplicity of

29

social capital measures – especially when we introduce non-profit counts across a large number of
industries, we use a machine learning algorithm to select the measures that are predictive of the strength of
local labor market networks. And fourth, we use a local labor market network measure that we have
validated in our past research showing that it is correlated with better job matches, faster re-employment
after mass layoffs, etc., and that it explicitly measures and captures the influence of the role of one’s
neighbors in helping one find a job.
That said, there are potential limitations, mainly related to trying to address these questions in a
large-scale, quantitative study. First, we do not – nor do most network researchers – observe direct network
connections between agents. 29 Second, and as a corollary, the network measure we use does not capture
other types of network connections that may influence job finding, such as connections to former workers,
university alumnae, or military service members (e.g., Cingano and Rosolia, 2012; Laschever, 2016; Oyer
and Schaefer, 2012). And third, we cannot identify the explicit ways in which social capital – as reflected in
the measures we use – enhance labor market networks. Fourth, social capital has many possible dimensions
that we may fail to capture in our social capital measures, such as trust and norms (Coleman, 1988), and
social capital that “bridges” – connecting dissimilar people – as opposed to “bonding” – connecting similar
people (e.g., Kim et al., 2006; Putnam, 2000).
In our view, it is critical to complement the kind of large-scale evidence we have assembled with
ethnographic and case study evidence that probes the explicit operation of labor market networks, and that
seeks to understand what influences – including explicit manifestations of different types of social capital –
the extent to which potential network members share information about jobs and workers and help people
find better job matches. One study that has critical elements of both types of evidence is the Kasinitz and
Rosenberg (1996) study of network hiring and social capital on the Red Hook, Brooklyn, waterfront. 30
Ultimately, the accumulation of evidence on labor market networks and what makes them stronger and
more effective can not only increase our understanding of behavior, but, ideally, also point to ways in

29

A significant exception in which researchers can observe these connections is the Add Health data set (see, e.g.,
Goodreau et al., 2009).
30
Portes (1998) discusses other similar studies.

30

which policymakers or other stakeholders can strengthen labor market networks to improve the inclusion
and integration into the labor market of groups that may have less access to good jobs.
There may also be ways to expand on the analysis of the large-scale data we use to refine
understanding of social capital measures. For example, there is research suggesting that religious and
secular voluntary associations (like our non-profits) have different forms of social capital, 31 and religious
denominations may vary in their degree of insularity and hence the type of social capital they create
(bonding versus bridging). 32 Furthermore, the value of various sources of social capital may vary across
persons in the same neighborhood with different characteristics. In the NETS data, organizations’ names
(and hence likely identities) are not confidential, so it could be possible to do research that links specific
information on these types of organizations with modifications of our labor market network measures that
try to capture which neighbors are connected. Intersecting institutional and personal characteristics might
yield interesting new findings, but the volume of output and demands for interpretation would be
substantially greater, so we leave that for future work.

Note: There are approximately 34,000 Census tract observations. The network measures are calculated using the LEHD Infrastructure Files for jobs
held in 2010 at the beginning of the second quarter. For details on the residence-based network isolation measures, see Equations 2 and 3 in Section II.
For details on the residence-based transport isolation measures, see Section III. Establishment counts are totaled by Census tract from the National
Establishment Time Series. Census tract demographic characteristics are constructed from the 2008-2012 ACS 5-year file. Measures of school districts
and voting are derived from the Department of Education’s Common Core of Data and the Harvard Election Data Archive (HEDA), respectively.

Note: Tabulations based on the National Establishment Time Series. Percent non-profit is based on observations with non-missing legal status field. For more complete descriptions,
see on-line appendix and https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/ (viewed March 30, 2017). In the NETS data, some establishments were never assigned a 6-digit code. So instead of
dropping these, we include them as is. One of these (NAICS 4-digit code 6241) appears in our list of industries with a high share of non-profit establishments. Industries highlighted
in boldface were retained in the Elastic Net estimation, with significant effects, as explained in notes to Table 4.

Notes: Results are for Ordinary Least Squares with robust standard errors in parentheses. For all models, variables are shown if
they are selected by the Elastic Net procedure and were statistically significant at the 5-percent level or less based on
conventional OLS standard errors; that is, all coefficients reported in the table are significant at the 5-percent level based on
OLS standard errors. The superscript † indicates that the estimate was statistically significant at the 5% level based on the Lee et
al. (2016, LSST) confidence intervals. There are approximately 34,000 Census tract observations. See Tables 1 and 2 for
variable definitions. However, columns (4) and (4’) are estimated on residualized models where are variables are first regressed
on the fixed state effects. The R2 values shown are for these residualized variables. Finally, as in Table 3, we omit from the
estimation in columns (1) and (3) the transport isolation index and establishment count controls.

So instead of dropping these, we include them as is. One of these (NAICS 4-digit code 6241) appears in our list of industries with a high share of non-profit establishments.
