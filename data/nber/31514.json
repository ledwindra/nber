    "abstract": "\n\nThe amount of information produced about firms\u2019 productivities and about the quality of collateral backing their loans varies over time. These information dynamics determine the evolution of credit, output and productivity, which feeds back into incentives to produce information. We characterize this intricate dynamic relation. A credit boom happens when information about collateral depreciates. A financial crisis happens when information about collateral is suddenly generated. Information about firms\u2019 individual productivities over credit booms can prevent or tame the crisis, acting as an endogenous macroprudential force.\n\n",
