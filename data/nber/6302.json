    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper is concerned with integration in the world capital market between the\" economies of the core and periphery in the twentieth century.  It proceeds with some general\" observations and with a special focus on the case of Argentina.  I will argue that understanding\" the changing relations in international capital markets offers important insights into the growth\" and development process, especially for the countries of the periphery.  Moreover extent of market integration in history informs current conditions in the relationship between\" capital-scarce economies, like Argentina, and the global capital market as a whole.  Looking to\" the future, the repercussions of economic reform and demographic change suggest likely\" implications for future saving, investment, and international capital flows.\"\n\n",
