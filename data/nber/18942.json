    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the dynamics linking monetary policy with bank leverage and show that adjustments in leverage act as the linchpin in the monetary transmission mechanism that works through fluctuations in risk-taking.  Motivated by the evidence, we formulate a model of the \"risk-taking channel\" of monetary policy in the international context that rests on the feedback loop between increased leverage of global banks and capital flows amid currency appreciation for capital recipient economies.\n\n",
