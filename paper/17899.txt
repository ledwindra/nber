Why Do Life Insurance Policyholders Lapse? The Roles of Income, Health and Bequest Motive
Shocks

NBER Working Paper No. 17899
March 2012
JEL No. G22,H31,L11
ABSTRACT
Previous research has shown that the reasons for lapsation have important implications regarding the
effects of the emerging life settlement market on consumer welfare. We present and empirically implement
a dynamic discrete choice model of life insurance decisions to assess the importance of various factors
in explaining life insurance lapsations. In order to explain some key features in the data, our model
incorporates serially correlated unobservable state variables which we deal with using posterior distributions
of the unobservables simulated from Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method. We estimate the model
using the life insurance holding information from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data. Counterfactual
simulations using the estimates of our model suggest that a large fraction of life insurance lapsations
are driven by i.i.d choice specific shocks, particularly when policyholders are relatively young. But
as the remaining policyholders get older, the role of such i.i.d. shocks gets smaller, and more of their
lapsations are driven either by income, health or bequest motive shocks. Income and health shocks
are relatively more important than bequest motive shocks in explaining lapsations when policyholders
are young, but as they age, the bequest motive shocks play a more important role. We also suggest
the implications of these findings regarding the effects of the emerging life settlement market on consumer
welfare.

Introduction
The life insurance market is large and important. Policyholders purchase life insurance to pro-

tect their dependents against financial hardship when the insured person, i.e. the policyholder,
dies. According to Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association International (LIMRA International), 78 percent of American families owned some type of life insurance in 2004. By the
end of 2008, the total number of individual life insurance policies in force in the United States
stood at about 156 million; and the total individual policy face amount in force reached over 10
trillion dollars (see American Council of Life Insurers (2009, p. 63-74)).
Life Insurance Market. There are two main types of individual life insurance products, Term
Life Insurance and Whole Life Insurance.1 A term life insurance policy covers a person for a specific duration at a fixed or variable premium for each year. If the person dies during the coverage
period, the life insurance company pays the face amount of the policy to his/her beneficiaries,
provided that the premium payment has never lapsed. The most popular type of term life insurance has a fixed premium during the coverage period and is called Level Term Life Insurance.
A whole life insurance policy, on the other hand, covers a person’s entire life, usually at a fixed
premium. In the United States at year-end 2008, 54 percent of all life insurance policies in force is
Term Life insurance. Of the new individual life insurance policies purchased in 2008, 43 percent,
or 4 million policies, were term insurance, totaling $1.3 trillion, or 73 percent, of the individual
life face amount issued (see American Council of Life Insurers (2009, p. 63-74)). Besides the difference in the period of coverage, term and whole life insurance policies also differ in the amount
of cash surrender value (CSV) received if the policyholder surrenders the policy to the insurance
company before the end of the coverage period. For term life insurance, the CSV is zero; for whole
life insurance, the CSV is typically positive and pre-specified to depend on the length of time that
the policyholder has owned the policy. One important feature of the CSV on whole life policies
relevant to our discussions below is that by government regulation, CSVs does not depend on the
health status of the policyholder when surrendering the policy.2
Lapsation.

Lapsation is an important phenomenon in life insurance markets. Both LIMRA and

Society of Actuaries consider that a policy lapses if its premium is not paid by the end of a specified
1
The Whole Life Insurance has several variations such as Universal Life (UL) and Variable Life (VL) and VariableUniversal Life (VUL). Universal Life allows varying premium amounts subject to a certain minimum and maximum.
For Variable Life, the death benefit varies with the performance of a portfolio of investments chosen by the policyholder.
Variable-Universal Life combines the flexible premium options of UL with the varied investment option of VL (see
Gilbert and Schultz, 1994).
2
The life insurance industry typically thinks of the CSV from the whole life insurance as a form of tax-advantaged
investment instrument (see Gilbert and Schultz, 1994).

time (often called the grace period).3 According to Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association, International (2009, p. 11), the life insurance industry calculates the annualized lapsation
rate as follows:
Annualized Policy Lapse Rate = 100 ×

Number of Policies Lapsed During the Year
.
Number of Policies Exposed to Lapse During the Year

The number of policies exposed to lapse is based on the length of time the policy is exposed to
the risk of lapsation during the year. Termination of policies due to death, maturity, or conversion
are not included in the number of policies lapsing and contribute to the exposure for only the
fraction of the policy year they were in force. Table 1 provides the lapsation rates of individual
life insurance policies, calculated according to the above formula, both according to face amount
and the number of policies for the period of 1998-2008. Of course, the lapsation rates also differ
significantly by the age of the policies. For example, Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association, International (2009, p. 18) showed that the lapsation rates are about 2-4% per year for
policies that have been in force for more than 11 years in 2004-2005.
Reasons for Lapsation Have Important Implications Regarding the Welfare Effects of Life Settlement Market.

Our interest in the empirical question of why life insurance policyholders lapse

their policies is primarily driven by the recent theoretical research on the effect of the life settlement market on consumer welfare. A life settlement is a financial transaction in which a policyholder sells his/her life insurance policy to a third party – the life settlement firm – for more
than the cash value offered by the policy itself. The life settlement firm subsequently assumes
responsibility for all future premium payments to the life insurance company, and becomes the
new beneficiary of the life insurance policy if the original policyholder dies within the coverage
period.4 The life settlement industry is quite recent, growing from just a few billion dollars in
3

This implies that if a policyholder surrenders his/her policy for cash surrender value, it is also considered as a
lapsation.
4
The legal basis for the life settlement market seems to be the Supreme Court ruling in Grigsby v. Russell [222 U.S.
149, 1911], which upheld that for life insurance an “insurable interest” only needs to be established at the time the

2

the late 1990s to about $12-$15 billion in 2007, and according to some projections (made prior to
the 2008 financial crisis), is expected to grow to more than $150 billion in the next decade (see
Chandik, 2008).5
In recent theoretical research, Daily, Hendel and Lizzeri (2008) and Fang and Kung (2010a)
showed that, if policyholders’ lapsation is driven by their loss of bequest motives, then consumer
welfare is unambiguously lower with life settlement market than without; however, Fang and
Kung (2010b) showed that if policyholders’ lapsation is driven by income or liquidity shocks,
then life settlement may potentially improve consumer welfare.
The reason for the difference in the welfare result is as follows. Life insurance is typically a
long-term contract with one-sided commitment in which the life insurance companies commit to
a typically constant stream of premium payments whereas the policyholder can lapse anytime.
Because the premium profile is typically constant while the policyholder’s mortality rate typically
increases with age, the contracts are thus front-loaded; that is, in the early part of the policy period, the premium payments exceed the actuarially fair value of the risk insured. In the later part
of the policy period, the premium payments are less than the actuarially fair value. As a result,
whenever a policyholder lapses his/her policy after holding it for several periods, the life insurance company pockets the so-called lapsation profits, which is factored into the pricing of the life
insurance policy to start with due to competition. The key effect of the settlement firms on the life
insurers is that the settlement firms will effectively take away the lapsation profits, forcing the life
insurers to adjust the policy premiums and possibly the whole structure of the life insurance policy under the consideration that lapsation profits do not exist. In the theoretical analysis, we show
that life insurers may respond to the threat of life settlement by limiting the degree of reclassification risk insurance, which certainly reduces consumer welfare.6 However, the settlement firms are
providing cash payments to policyholders when the policies are sold to the life settlement firms.
The welfare loss from the reduction in extent of reclassification risk insurance has to be balanced
against the welfare gain to the consumers when they receive payments from the settlement firms
when their policies are sold. If policyholders sell their policies due to income shocks, then the cash
payments are received at a time when the marginal utility of income is particularly high, and the
policy becomes effective, but does not have to exist at the time the loss occurs. The life insurance industry has typically
included a two-year contestability period during which transfer of the life insurance policy will void the insurance.
5
The life settlement industry actively targets wealthy seniors 65 years of age and older with life expectancies from 2
to up to 12-15 years. This differs from the earlier viatical settlement market developed during the 1980s in response to
the AIDS crisis, which targeted persons in the 25-44 age band diagnosed with AIDS with life expectancy of 24 months
or less. The viatical market largely evaporated after medical advances dramatically prolonged the life expectancy of an
AIDS diagnosis.
6
The constant premium specified in the typical long-term life insurance contracts insures against the fluctuations in
the actuarial-fair premium as the policyholder’s health changes. This type of insurance is known as reclassification risk
insurance.

balance of the two effects may result in a net welfare gain for the policyholders. If policyholders
sell their policies as a result of losing bequest motives, the balance of the two effects on net result in
a welfare loss. Thus, to inform policy-makers on how the emerging life settlement market should
be regulated, an empirical understanding of why policyholders lapse is of crucial importance.
What Do We Do in This Paper? For this purpose, we present and empirically implement a
dynamic discrete choice model of life insurance decisions. The model is “semi-structural” and
is designed to bypass data limitations where researchers only observe whether an individual has
made a new life insurance decision (i.e., purchased a new policy, or added to/changed an existing
policy) but do not observe what the actual policy choice is nor the choice set from which the new
policy is selected. We empirically implement the model using the limited life insurance holding
information from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data. An important feature of our model
is the incorporation of serially correlated unobservable state variables. In our empirical analysis,
we provide ample evidence that such serially correlated unobservable state variables are necessary
to explain some key features in the data.
Methodologically, we deal with serially correlated unobserved state variables using posterior
distributions of the unobservables simulated using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods.7 Relative to the few existing papers in the economics literature that have used similar SMC methods,
our paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to incorporate multi-dimensional serially correlated unobserved state variables. In order to give the three unobservable state variables in our
empirical model their desired interpretations as unobserved income, health and bequest motive
shocks respectively, we propose two channels through which we can anchor these unobservables
to their related observable counterparts. We also discuss how the additional unobservable state
variables significantly improve our model fit.
Our estimates for the model with serially correlated unobservable state variables are sensible
and yield implications about individuals’ life insurance decisions consistent with the both intuition and existing empirical results. In a series of counterfactual simulations reported in Table 12,
we find that a large fraction of life insurance lapsations are driven by i.i.d choice specific shocks,
particularly when policyholders are relatively young. But as the remaining policyholders get
older, the role of such i.i.d. shocks gets smaller, and more of their lapsations are driven either by
income, health or bequest motive shocks. Income and health shocks are relatively more important
than bequest motive shocks in explaining lapsation when policyholders are young, but as they

state variables.

age, the bequest motive shocks play a more important role. We discuss the implications of these
findings on the effects of life settlement markets on consumer welfare.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data set used
in our empirical analysis and describe how we constructed key variables, and we also provide the
descriptive statistics. In Section 3 we present the empirical model of life insurance decisions.In
Section 4 we estimate the dynamic model without serially correlated unobservable state variables,
and show via simulations that the dynamic model without serially correlated unobservable state
variables fails to replicate some important features of the data. In Section 5 we extend the dynamic
model to incorporate serially correlated unobserved state variables, describe the SMC method to
account for them in estimation, and provide the estimation results. In Section 6 we report our
counterfactual experiments using the model with unobservables. In section 7 we conclude.

Data
We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is a nationally representa-

tive longitudinal survey of older Americans which began in 1992 and has been conducted every
two years thereafter.8 The HRS is particularly well suited for our study for two reasons. First,
the HRS contains rich information about income, health, family structure, and life insurance ownership. If family structure can be interpreted as a measure of bequest motive, then we have all
the key factors motivating our analysis. Second, the HRS respondents are generally quite old:
between 50 to 70 years of age in their first interview. As we described in the introduction, the life
settlements industry typically targets policyholders in this age range or older, so it is precisely the
lapsation behavior of this group that we are most interested in.
Our original sample consists of 4,512 male respondents who were successfully interviewed
in both the 1994 and 1996 HRS waves, and who were between the ages of 50 and 70 in 1996.
We chose 1996 as the period to begin decision modeling because the 1996 wave is the first time
the HRS began to ask questions about whether or not the respondent lapsed any life insurance
policies and whether or not the respondent obtained any new life insurance policies since the last
interview. As we will explain below, these questions are used prominently in the construction of
the key decision variable used in our structural model. We use only respondents who were also
interviewed in 1994 so we can know whether or not they owned life insurance in 1994.
We follow these respondents until 2006. Any respondent who missed an interview for any
reason other than death between 1996 and 2006 was dropped from the sample. Any respondent

with a missing value on life insurance ownership any time during this period was also dropped.
This leaves us a sample of 3,567 males. We also dropped 243 individuals who never reported
owning life insurance during all the waves of HRS data. Our final analysis sample thus consists of
3,324 in wave 1996 and the survivors among them in subsequent waves, 3,195 in wave 1998, 3022
in wave 2000, 2,854 in wave 2002, 2,717 in wave 2004 and 2,558 in wave 2006. Table 2 describes
how we come to our final estimation sample.
Construction of Variables Related to Life Insurance Decisions.

Here we describe the questions

in HRS we use to construct the life-insurance related variables.
∙ For whether or not an individual owned life insurance in the current wave, we use the individual’s response to the following HRS survey question, which is asked in all waves:
[Q1] “Do you currently have any life insurance?”
∙ For whether or not an individual obtained a policy since the previous wave, we use the
individual’s response to the following HRS question, which is asked all waves starting in
1996:
[Q2] “Since (previous wave interview month-year) have you obtained any new life insurance
policies?”
If the respondent answers “yes,” we consider him to have obtained a new policy.
∙ For whether or not an individual lapsed a policy since last wave, we use the individual’s
response to the following HRS question, which is asked all waves starting in 1996:
[Q3] “Since (previous wave interview month-year) have you allowed any life insurance policies to lapse or have any been cancelled?”
6

We also use the response to another survey question, which is also asked all waves starting
in 1996:
[Q4] “Was this lapse or cancellation something you chose to do, or was it done by the
provider, your employer, or someone else?”
If the respondent answers “yes” to the first question and answers “my decision” to the second question, we consider him to have lapsed a policy.
In the notation of the model we will present in the Section 3, we construct an individual’s
period-𝑡 (or wave- 𝑡) decisions as follows:
∙ For the individual who reported not having life insurance in the previous wave (𝑑𝑡−1 = 0),
we let 𝑑𝑡 = 0 if the individual reports not having life insurance this wave; and 𝑑𝑡 = 1 if
the individual reports having life insurance this wave (“yes” to Q1). Because the individual
does not own life insurance in period 𝑡 − 1 but does in period 𝑡, we interpret that he chose
the optimal policy in period 𝑡 given his state variables at 𝑡.
∙ For the individual who reported having life insurance in the previous wave (𝑑𝑡−1 > 1), we let
𝑑𝑡 = 0 if the individual reports not having life insurance this wave (“no” to Q1); and we let
𝑑𝑡 = 1 (i.e. the individual re-optimizes his life insurance) if the individual reports having life
insurance this wave (“yes” to Q1) and he obtained new life insurance policy (“yes” to Q2),
OR if the individual answered “yes” to Q1, reported lapsing (i.e. answered “yes” to Q3) and
reported that lapse was his own decision (answered “my own decision” to Q4). Note that
under this construction, we have interpreted the “lapsing or obtaining” of any policies as an
indication that the respondent re-optimized his life insurance coverage. Finally, we let 𝑑𝑡 = 2
(i.e. he kept his previous life insurance policy unchanged) if the individual reports having
life insurance this wave (“yes” to Q1) AND the individual did not report yes to obtaining
new policy (“no” to Q2) AND the individual did not lapse any existing policy (either report
“no” to Q3 or reported “yes” to Q3 but did not report “my decision” to Q4).
Information About the Details of Life Insurance Holdings in the HRS Data.

HRS also has

questions regarding the face amount and premium payments for life insurance policies. However, there are several problems with incorporating these variables into our empirical analysis.
First, the questions differ across waves. In the 1994 wave, questions were asked regarding total
face amount and premium for term life policies; but for whole life policies only total face amount
was collected.9 In 1996 and 1998 waves the information about lapsations, face amounts, but not
9

The questions in 1994 wave related to premium and face amount are: [W6768]. About how much do you pay for
(this term insurance/these term insurance policies) each month or year? [W6769]. Was that per month, year, or what?

premium of life insurance policies were collected. From 2000 on, the HRS asked about the combined face value for all policies, combined face value for whole life policies, and the combined
premium payments for whole life policies. Note that the premium for term life policies were not
collected from 2000 on. Second, there is a very high incidence of missing data regarding life insurance premiums and face amounts. In our selected sample, 40.3% of our selected sample (1340
individuals) have at least one instance of missing face amount in waves when he reported owning
life insurance. The incidence of missing values in premium payments is even higher. Third, even
for those who reported face amount and premium payments for their life insurance policies, we
do not know the choice set they faced when purchasing their policies.
For these reasons, we decide to only model the individuals’ life insurance decisions regarding whether to re-optimize, lapse or maintaining an existing policy, and only use the observed
information about the above decisions in estimating the model.

2.1

Descriptive Statistics

Patterns of Life Insurance Coverage and its Transitions.

Table 3 provides the life insurance

coverage and patterns of transition between coverage and no coverage in the HRS data. Panel A
shows that among the 3,324 live respondents in 1996, 88.1% are covered by life insurance; among
the 3,195 who survived to the 1998 wave, 85.7% owned life insurance, etc. Over the waves, the life
insurance coverage rates among the live respondents seem to exhibit a declining trend, with the
coverage rate among the 2,558 who survived to the 2006 wave being about 78.6%.
Panel B and C show, however, that there are substantial transition between the coverage and no
coverage. Panel B shows that among the 512 individuals who did not have life insurance coverage
in 1994, almost a half (47.5%) obtained coverage in 1996; in later waves between 25.6% to 33.7%
of individuals without life insurance in the previous wave ended up with coverage in the next
wave. Panel C shows that there is also substantial lapsation among life insurance policyholders.
In our data, between-wave lapsation rates range from 4.6% to 10.2%. Considering that our sample
is relatively old and the tenures of holding life insurance policies in the HRS sample are also
typically longer, these lapsation rates are in line with the industry lapsation rates reported in the
introduction (see Table 1).
Panel D shows that even among those individuals who own life insurance in both the previous
wave and the current wave, a substantial fraction has changed their coverage, or in the words of
our model, re-optimized. Between 6.0% to 9.5% of the sample who have insurance coverage in
adjacent waves reported changing their coverages by their “own decisions”.

Summary Statistics of State Variables. Table 4 summarizes the key state variables for the sample
used in our empirical analysis. It shows that the average age of the live respondents in our sample
is 61.1, which increases by slightly less than two years in the next waves. This is as expected,
because those who did not survive to the next wave because of death tend to be older than average.
The mean of log household income in our sample is quite stable around 10.58 to 10.73, with slight
increase over the waves, possibly because low income individuals tend to die earlier. The next
eight rows report the mean of the incidence of health conditions, including high blood pressure,
diabetes, cancer, lung disease, heart disease, stroke, psychological problem and arthritis. It shows
clear signs of health deterioration for the surviving samples over the years. The sum of the above
eight health conditions steadily increase from 1.37 in 1996 to 2.34 in 2006. Finally, the marital status
of the surviving sample seems to be quite stable, with the fraction married being in the range of
83% to 85%.
Tables A.1 and A.2 in the appendix summarize the mean and standard deviation of the state
variables by the life insurance coverage status. There does not seem to be much of a difference in
ages between those with and without life insurance coverage, but the mean log household income
is significantly higher for those with life insurance than those without and life insurance policyholders are much more likely to be married than those without. However, somewhat surprisingly
those with life insurance tend to be healthier than those without life insurance.
Reduced-Form Determinants of the Life Insurance Decisions.

Table 5 presents the coefficient

estimates of a Logit regression on the probability of purchasing life insurance among those who
did not have coverage in the previous wave. It shows that the richer, younger, healthier and
married individuals are more likely to purchase life insurance coverage than the poorer, older,
unhealthier and widowed individuals. Table 6 presents the estimates of a multinomial Logit regression for the probability of lapsing, changing coverage, or maintaining the previous coverage.
The omitted category is lapsing all coverage. The estimates show that richer individuals are more
likely to either maintain the current coverage or changing existing coverage than to lapse all coverage; individuals who experienced negative income shocks are more likely to lapse all coverages;
individuals who are either divorced or widowed are more likely to lapse all coverages; finally,
individuals who have experienced an increase in the number of health conditions are somewhat
more likely to lapse all coverage, though the effect is not statistically significant.

An Empirical Model of Life Insurance Decisions
In this section we present a dynamic discrete choice model of how individuals make life insur-

ance decisions, which we will later empirically implement. Our model is simple, yet rich enough
to capture the dynamic intuition behind the life insurance models of Hendel and Lizzeri (2003)
and Fang and Kung (2010a).
Time is discrete and indexed by 𝑡 = 1, 2, ... In the beginning of each period 𝑡, an individual 𝑖
either has or does not have an existing life insurance policy. If the individual enters period 𝑡 without an existing policy, then he chooses between not owning life insurance (𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 0) or optimally
purchasing a new policy (𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 1). If the individual enters period 𝑡 with an existing policy, then,
besides the above two choices, he can additionally choose to keep his existing policy (𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 2). If
an individual who has life insurance in period 𝑡 − 1 decides not to own life insurance in period
𝑡, we interpret it as lapsation of coverage. As we describe in Section 2, the choice 𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 1 for an
individual who previously owns at least one policy is interpreted more broadly: an individual
is considered to have re-optimized his existing policy if he reported purchasing a new policy or
choosing to lapse one of the existing policies (while he continues to hold at least one policy). The
key interpretation for choice 𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 1 is that the individual re-optimized his life insurance holdings.

Notes: (1). Conditional on owning life insurance, the three choices are: (a). to lapse all coverage; (b). to change the

existing coverage; and (c). to maintain the existing coverage. The base outcome is set to choice (a). For any
variable 𝑥, Δ𝑥 is the difference between the current value of 𝑥 and the value of 𝑥 which occurred during the
last period in which the respondent changed his coverage.

Flow Payoffs from Choices. Now we describe an individual’s payoffs from each of these choices.
First, let 𝑥𝑖𝑡 ∈ 𝒳 denote the vector of observable state variables of individual 𝑖 in period 𝑡, and let
𝑧𝑖𝑡 ∈ 𝒵 denote the vector of unobservable state variables.10 These characteristics include variables
that affect the individual’s preference for or cost of owning life insurance, such as income, health
and bequest motives. We normalize the utility from not owning life insurance (i.e., 𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 0) to 0;
that is,
𝑢0 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) = 0 for all (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) ∈ 𝒳 × 𝒵.

(1)

The utility from optimally purchasing a new policy in state (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ), i.e., 𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 1, regardless of
whether he previously owned a life insurance policy, is assumed to be:
𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝜀1𝑖𝑡 ,

(2)

where 𝜀1𝑖𝑡 is an idiosyncratic choice specific shock, drawn from to a Type-I extreme value distribution. In our empirical analysis, we will specify 𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) as a flexible polynomial of 𝑥𝑖𝑡 and
𝑧𝑖𝑡 .
Now we consider the flow utility for an individual 𝑖 entering period 𝑡 with an existing policy
which was last re-optimized at at period 𝑡ˆ. That is, let 𝑡ˆ = sup {𝑠∣𝑠 < 𝑡, 𝑑𝑖𝑠 = 1}. Let (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) =
(𝑥𝑖𝑡ˆ, 𝑧𝑖𝑡ˆ) denote the state vector that 𝑖 was in when he last re-optimized his life insurance. We
assume that the flow utility individual 𝑖 obtains from continuing the existing policies purchased
when his state vector was (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) is given by
𝑢2 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 , 𝜀2𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) − 𝑐((𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) , (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 )) + 𝜀2𝑖𝑡 ,

(3)

where 𝑐 (⋅, ⋅) can be considered as a sub-optimality penalty function, which may also include (the
negative of ) adjustment costs (see discussion below in Section 3.1), that possibly depends on
the “distance” between the current state (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) and the state in which the existing policy was
purchased (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ). The adjustment cost can be positive or negative, depending on the factors that
have changed. For example, if the individual was married when he purchased the existing policy
but is not married now, then, all other things equal, the adjustment cost is likely to be negative; he
would have less incentive to keep the existing policy. On the other hand, if the individual’s health
has deteriorated substantially, then obtaining a new policy could be prohibitively costly, in which
case the adjustment cost is likely to be positive; he would have more incentive to keep the existing
policy which was purchased during a healthier state.
10

We present the model here assuming the presence of both the observed and unobserved state variables. In Section 4,
we will also estimate a model with only observed state variables. In that case, we should simply ignore the unobserved
state vector 𝑧𝑖𝑡 .

14

To summarize, we model the life insurance choice as the decision to either: (1). hold no life
insurance; (2). purchase a new insurance policy which is optimal for the current state; or (3).
continue with an existing policy. By decomposing the ownership decision into continuation vs.
re-optimization, our model is able to capture the intuition that an individual who has suffered
a negative shock to a factor that positively affects life insurance ownership (such as income or
bequest motive) may still be likely to keep his insurance if the policy was initially purchased a
long time ago during a better health state.
Moreover, the decomposition of the ownership decision allows us to examine two separate
motives for lapsation: lapsation because the individual no longer needs any life insurance, and
lapsation because the policyholder’s personal situation, i.e. (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) , has changed such that new
coverage terms are required.
Parametric Assumptions on 𝑢1 and 𝑐 Functions. In our empirical implementation of the model,
we let the observed state vector 𝑥𝑖𝑡 include age, log household income, sum of the number of
health conditions, marital status, an indicator for whether the individual has children, and the age
of the youngest child. We let the unobserved state vector 𝑧𝑖𝑡 include 𝑧1𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧2𝑖𝑡 and 𝑧3𝑖𝑡 which respectively represent the unobserved components of income, health and bequest motives. In Section 5
below, we will describe how we anchor these unobservables to their intended interpretations and
how we use sequential Monte Carlo method to simulate their posterior distributions.
The primitives of our model are thus given by the utility function of optimally purchasing life
insurance 𝑢1 , and the sub-optimality adjustment function 𝑐. In our empirical analysis we adopt
the following parametric specifications for 𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) and 𝑐 ((𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) , (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 )):
𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝜃0 + 𝜃1 AGE𝑖𝑡 + 𝜃2 (LOGINCOME𝑖𝑡 + 𝑧1𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝜃3 (CONDITIONS𝑖𝑡 + 𝑧1𝑖𝑡 )

In Section 3.1 below, we will provide an interpretation of the above-specified 𝑐 (⋅, ⋅) function as
a sub-optimality penalty function.
Transitions of the State Variables.

The state variables which an individual must keep track of

depend on whether the individual is currently a policyholder. If he currently does not own a
policy, his state variable is simply his current state vector (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) ; if he currently owns a policy,
then his state variables include both his current state vector (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) and the state vector (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) at
which he purchased the policy he currently owns.
In our empirical analysis, we assume that the current state vectors (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) evolve exogenously
(i.e., not affected by the individual’s decision) according to a joint distribution given by
(𝑥𝑖𝑡+1 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡+1 ) ∼ 𝑓 (𝑥𝑖𝑡+1 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡+1 ∣𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) .
In particular, for the observed state vector 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , which includes age, log household income, sum of
the number of health conditions, and their respective squares, marital status, whether the individual has children, and the age of the youngest child, we estimate their evolutions directly from the
data. For the unobserved state vector 𝑧𝑖𝑡 , we will use sequential Monte Carlo methods to simulate
its evolution (see Section 5.2 below for details).
The evolution of the state vector (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) is endogenous, and it is given as follows. If the
individual does not own life insurance at period 𝑡, which we denote by setting (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) = ∅, then

[ (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡+1 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡+1 )∣ (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) = ∅] =

⎧

⎨ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) if 𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 1

where ∅ denotes that the individual remains with no life insurance. If the individual owns life
insurance at period 𝑡 purchased at state (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) , then

[ (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡+1 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡+1 )∣ (ˆ

Discussion

Dynamic Discrete Choice Model without the Knowledge of the Choice and Choice Set.

As

we mentioned in Section 2, we do not have complete information about the exact life insurance
policies owned by the individuals, and for those whose life insurance policy we do know about,
16

we do not know their choice sets. However, we do know whether an individual has re-optimized
his life insurance policy holdings (i.e., purchase a new life insurance policy, or changed the amount
of his existing coverage), or has dropped coverage etc.
In fact the data restrictions we face are fairly typical for many applications.11 For example, in
the study of housing market, it is possible that all we observe is whether a family moved to a new
house, remained in the same house, or decided to rent; but we may not observe the characteristics
(including the purchase price) of the new house the family moved into, or the characteristics of the
house/apartment the family rented; and most likely, we are not able to observe the set of houses
or apartments the family has considered purchasing or renting (see, e.g., Kung (2012)).
Our formulation provides an indirect utility approach to deal with such data limitations. Suppose that when individual 𝑖′ s state vector is (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) , he has a choice set ℒ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) which includes
all the possible life insurance policies that he could choose from. Note that ℒ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) depends on
𝑖’s state vector (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ), which captures the notion that life insurance premium and face amount
typically depend on at least some of the characteristics of the insured. Let ℓ ∈ ℒ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) denote one such available policy. Let 𝑢∗ (ℓ; 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) denote individual 𝑖′ 𝑠 primitive flow utility from
purchasing policy ℓ. If he were to choose to own a life insurance, his choice of the life insurance
contract from his available choice set will be determined by the solution to the following problem:
𝑉 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) =

max
ℓ∈ℒ(𝑥𝑖𝑡 ,𝑧𝑖𝑡 )

{𝑢∗ (ℓ; 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝜀ℓ𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽E [𝑉 (𝑥𝑖𝑡+1 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡+1 ) ∣ℓ, 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ]} .

(8)

Let ℓ∗ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) denote the solution. Then the flow utility 𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) we specified in (2) can be
interpreted as the indirect flow utility, i.e.,
𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝑢∗ (ℓ∗ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) ; 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) .

(9)

It should be pointed out that, under the above indirect flow utility interpretation of 𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) ,
in order for the error term 𝜀1𝑖𝑡 in (2) to be distributed as i.i.d extreme value as assumed, we need
to make the assumption that 𝜀ℓ𝑖𝑡 in (8) does not vary across ℓ ∈ ℒ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ). This seems to be a
plausible assumption.
Interpretations of the Sub-Optimality Penalty Function 𝑐 (⋅) .

The sub-optimality penalty func-

tion 𝑐 (⋅) we introduced in (3) admits a potential interpretation that changing an existing life insur11

McFadden (1978) and Fox (2007) studied problems where the researcher only observes the choices of decisionmakers from a subset of choices. McFadden (1978) showed that in a class of discrete-choice models where choice specific
error terms have a block additive generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions, the standard maximum likelihood
estimator remains consistent. Fox (2007) proposed using semiparametric multinomial maximum-score estimator when
estimation uses data on a subset of the choices available to agents in the data-generating process, thus relaxing the
distributional assumptions on the error term required for McFadden (1978).

ance policy may incur adjustment costs. To see this, consider an individual whose current state
vector is (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) and owns a life insurance policy he purchased at 𝑡ˆ when his state vector was
(𝑥𝑖𝑡ˆ, 𝑧𝑖𝑡ˆ) . Suppose that he decides to change (lapse or modify) his current policy and re-optimize,
but there is an adjustment cost of 𝜅 > 0 for changing. Thus, the flow utility from lapsing into no
coverage for this individual will be
𝑢0 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) = 0.
The flow utility from re-optimizing, using the notation from (9), will be
𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝑢∗ (ℓ∗ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) ; 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) − 𝜅.
And the flow utility from keeping the existing policy is
𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ,𝑧𝑖𝑡 )

𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) ; 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 )] − 𝜅.
Note that in the above expression for 𝑐 ((𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ), (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 )) , the term in the square bracket is the
difference between the flow utility the individual could have received from the the life insurance
optimal for the current state (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ), denoted by ℓ∗ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) , and that he receives from the contract
ℓ∗ (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) which he purchased when his state is (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) ; i.e., it measures the utility loss from
holding a policy ℓ∗ (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) that was optimal for state vector (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) , but sub-optimal when state
vector is (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) . But by not re-optimizing, the individual saves the adjustment cost 𝜅. Given the
presence of adjustment cost 𝜅, we would expect that an existing policyholders will hold on to his
policy until the sub-optimality penalty [𝑢∗ (ℓ∗ (𝑥𝑖𝑡ˆ, 𝑧𝑖𝑡ˆ) ; 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) − 𝑢∗ (ℓ∗ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) ; 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 )] exceeds
the adjustment cost 𝜅, if we ignore decisions driven by i.i.d preference shocks 𝜀1𝑖𝑡 and 𝜀2𝑖𝑡 .
It is clear from the above discussion that, in this formulation, we can also allow the adjustmentt
cost 𝜅 to be made a function of (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) , though we will not be able to separate the sub-optimality
penalty [𝑢∗ (ℓ∗ (𝑥𝑖𝑡ˆ, 𝑧𝑖𝑡ˆ) ; 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) − 𝑢∗ (ℓ∗ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) ; 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 )] from 𝜅 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) .12
12
If the adjustment cost 𝜅 is incurred both when the individual lapses into no coverage, and when he re-optimizes,
i.e., if 𝑢0 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) = −𝜅, and 𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝑢∗ (ℓ∗ (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) ; 𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) − 𝜅, then we can allow 𝜅 to depend on both (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 )
and (𝑥𝑖𝑡ˆ, 𝑧𝑖𝑡ˆ) .

18

It is also worth pointing out that our parametric specifications of 𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) and 𝑐 ((𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ), (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 )) ,
as given in (4) and (5) respectively, are consistent with the above interpretations of the suboptimality penalty function.13
Limitations of the “Indirect Flow Utility” Approach.

In this paper we adopt the “indirect flow

utility” approach to deal with the lack of information regarding individuals’ actual choices of life
insurance policies and their relevant choice set. This is useful for our purpose of understanding why policyholders lapse their coverage (as we will demonstrate later), but it comes with a
limitation. The indirect flow utilities 𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) and 𝑢2 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 ), defined in (9) and (10)
respectively, are derived only under the existing life insurance market structure. As a result, the estimated indirect flow utility functions are not primitives that are invariant to counterfactual policy
changes that may affect the equilibrium of the life insurance market. Of course, this limitation is
also present in other dynamic discrete choice models where the flow utility functions can have the
interpretation as reduced-form, indirect utility function of a more detailed choice problem.14

Estimates from a Dynamic Discrete Choice Model Without
Unobservable State Variables
In this section, we present our estimation and simulation results for the dynamic structural

model of life insurance decisions presented in Section 3. However, in order to illustrate the importance of unobserved state variables in the life insurance decisions (which we turn to in the
next section), we deliberately do not include any unobserved state variables 𝑧𝑖𝑡 in this section.
The estimation and simulation results for a dynamic discrete choice model with unobserved state
variables are presented in Section 5.
As described in Section (3) the flow utilities are given by equations (1)-(3). Since we only
include observed state variables in this section, we will for simplicity denote the transition distributions of the state variables 𝑥𝑖𝑡 by 𝑃 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ∣𝑥𝑖𝑡−1 ). Since 𝑥𝑖𝑡 are observable, we estimate 𝑃 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ∣𝑥𝑖𝑡−1 )
separately and then take it as given. As we mentioned in Section 3, we assume that the evolution
of the state variables 𝑥𝑖𝑡 does not depend on the life insurance choices analyzed in this model.
However, the evolution of the “hatted” state variables does depend on the choices. Specifically,
𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡+1 = 𝑥𝑖𝑡 if 𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 1; 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡+1 = 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 if 𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 2; and 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡+1 = ∅ if 𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 0. As usual we use 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 = ∅
13
Due to the ages of the individuals in our estimation sample, we have practically no changes in the number of
children. Thust the difference between AGE OF YOUNGEST CHILD𝑖𝑡 and AGE OF YOUNGEST CHILD𝑖𝑡ˆ is essentially the
same as the difference between A GE𝑖𝑡 and A GE𝑖𝑡ˆ.
14
For example, in many I.O. papers a reduced-form flow profit function is assumed. Presumably, the profit function
is not invariant to changes in the market structure.

to denote an individual who does not own life insurance at the beginning of period 𝑡. Finally, we
assume that the yearly discount factor is 0.9, and thus the per period (two years) discount factor in
our model is 𝛽 = 0.81, and we assume that the time horizon is finite. We choose age 80 as the last
year in the decision horizon, because that is the oldest age in our data set. Thus, an individual of
age 80 chooses myopically according to 𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) and 𝑢2 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 ).
At period 𝑡, let 𝑉0𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) be the present value from choosing 𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 0 (no life insurance); and
let 𝑉1𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) be the present value from choosing 𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 1 (re-optimize), and let 𝑉2𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) be the
present value to choosing 𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 2 (keep existing policy) for those who owned policies previously
purchased at state 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 . To derive these choice-specific value functions, it is useful to first derive the
inclusive continuation values from being in a give state vector. Let 𝑉𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) denote the period-𝑡
inclusive value for being in state 𝑥𝑖𝑡 and having an existing policy purchased when the state vector
is 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 , and let 𝑊𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) denote the period-𝑡 inclusive value for being in state 𝑥𝑖𝑡 and not having any
existing life insurance. Under the assumption of additively separable choice specific shocks drawn
from i.i.d. Type-1 extreme value distributions and using 𝐺 (⋅) to denote the joint distribution of
the random vector 𝜀𝑡 ≡ (𝜀1𝑡 , 𝜀2𝑡 ) , 𝑉𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) and 𝑊𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) can be, following Rust (1994), expressed
as:
∫
𝑉𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) =

max {𝑉0𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ), 𝑉1𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝜀1𝑡 , 𝑉2𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝜀2𝑡 } 𝑑𝐺(𝜀𝑡 )

= log {exp [𝑉0𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )] + exp [𝑉1𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )] + exp [𝑉2𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 )]} + 0.57722,
∫
𝑊𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) = max {𝑉0𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ), 𝑉1𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝜀1𝑡 } 𝑑𝐺(𝜀)
= log {exp [𝑉0𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )] + exp [𝑉1𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )]} + 0.57722,

(11)

(12)

where 0.57722 is the Euler constant. Then, the choice-specific present value functions can be written as follows:
∫
𝑊𝑡+1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡+1 )𝑑𝑃 (𝑥𝑖𝑡+1 ∣𝑥𝑖𝑡 ),
∫
𝑉1𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝛽 𝑉𝑡+1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡+1 , 𝑥𝑖𝑡 )𝑑𝑃 (𝑥𝑖𝑡+1 ∣𝑥𝑖𝑡 ),
∫
𝑉2𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝑢2 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝛽 𝑉𝑡+1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡+1 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 )𝑑𝑃 (𝑥𝑖𝑡+1 ∣𝑥𝑖𝑡 ).
𝑉0𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝛽

(13)
(14)
(15)

Since we assume that age 80 is the final period, we have 𝑉0,80 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) = 0, 𝑉1,80 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ) and
𝑉2,80 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝑢2 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 ). Using this, we can solve for the choice-specific value functions at each
age through backward recursion.
The choice probabilities at each period 𝑡 are then given as follows. For individuals without life

20

insurance in the beginning of period 𝑡, their choice probabilities for 𝑑𝑖𝑡 ∈ {0, 1} are given by:
exp [𝑉0𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )]
,
exp [𝑉0𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )] + exp [𝑉1𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )]
exp [𝑉1𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )]
Pr {𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 1∣𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 = ∅} =
.
exp [𝑉0𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )] + exp [𝑉1𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )]
Pr {𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 0∣𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 = ∅} =

For individuals who own life insurance in the beginning of period 𝑡, which are purchased in
previous waves when state vector is 𝑥
ˆ𝑖𝑡 , their choice probabilities for 𝑑𝑖𝑡 ∈ {0, 1, 2} are given by:
exp [𝑉0𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )]
,
exp [𝑉0𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )] + exp [𝑉1𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 )] + exp [𝑉2𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥

Pr {𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 2∣𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥

ˆ𝑖𝑡 )]

Pr {𝑑𝑖𝑡 = 0∣𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥

We estimate the parameters using maximum likelihood. A simulation and interpolation method
is used to compute and then integrate out the inclusive value terms. The numerical solution
method we employ closely follows Keane and Wolpin (1994). Among the state variables, two
of them are allowed to be continuous, namely the current log income and the log income when
the last re-optimization of life insurance occurred; the other state variables are discrete. But the
size of the state space, not including log incomes, is still very large.15 We thus use Keane and
Wolpin’s method for approximating the expected continuation values using only a subset of the
state space.16

4.1

Estimation Results
Table 7 presents the coefficient estimates for 𝑢1 (⋅) and 𝑐 (⋅) for the dynamic discrete choice

model without serially correlated unobservable state variables. The estimated coefficients for the
function 𝑢1 (⋅) as specified in (4) are reported in Panel A. The estimates indicate that married
individuals have more to gain from optimally purchasing new insurance, whereas older and less
healthy individuals have less to gain. This is consistent with the interpretation that the cost of
re-optimizing one’s life insurance increases when one gets older and has poorer health, whereas
15
The state variable “conditions” is the number of health conditions ever diagnosed, where the health conditions
used are: 1. high blood pressure; 2. diabetes; 3. cancer; 4. lung disease; 5. heart disease; 6. stroke; 7. psychological
problem; 8. arthritis. Each of these 8 health conditions was carried around as a binary state variable (1 or 0) and the
transitions for each of these were estimated separately. So, there were 2ˆ8 possible combinations of health conditions,
ˆ
but only 9 (0 through 8) possible values for ”C ONDITIONS” and ”C ONDITIONS
”.
16
The subset we use for interpolation consists of 400 randomly drawn points in the state space. For the numerical
integration over the state space, 40 random draws from the state space were used.

marriage is a bequest factor that leads to the purchase of life insurance. Log income enters 𝑢1 (⋅)
nonlinearly, but in the most relevant income ranges in our data, individuals with higher incomes
are more likely to purchase life insurance. This is partly because higher income makes any given
amount of coverage more affordable and partly because individuals with higher incomes would
like to leave more bequests to their dependents. Panel A also shows that individuals with children
has higher utility from re-optimizing though the effect is not statistically significant.
Panel B of Table 7 reports the estimated coefficients for the function 𝑐 (⋅) as specified in (5). The
positive coefficient estimate on ΔAGE and the negative coefficient estimate on (ΔAGE)2 indicate
that the effect of ΔAGE – the difference in the current age and the age when the existing policy was
purchased – on 𝑐 (⋅) is nonlinear: when ΔAGE is small, the sub-optimality penalty is high, or in
other words, it is less costly for the policyholder to re-optimize; but as ΔAGE gets larger, the cost of
re-optimizing increases. The positive coefficient estimates on Δ log INCOME and (Δ log INCOME)2
indicate that policyholders are more likely to stay with their existing policy when income has
declined, but more likely to re-optimize when income has risen.
However, in this model without serially-correlated unobservables, we found that the coefficient estimates on both ΔCONDITIONS and (ΔCONDITIONS)2 are positive, which suggests that
as the policyholder becomes less healthy, the sub-optimality penalty of staying with the existing policy increases, and individuals would be more likely to re-optimize, though the effect is
not statistically significant. The finding that the less healthy policyholders are more likely to
re-optimize is counterfactual. Indeed He (2010) found that less healthy policyholders are more
likely to keep the existing policy, or alternatively, the healthier policyholders are more likely to
re-optimize or lapse, which is consistent with the predictions of adverse selection in lapsation
decisions in Hendel and Lizzeri (2003). We will show in Table 9a below that once we introduce
serially unobserved state variables in our model, we will find that individuals who experience
deuteration in health are more likely to re-optimize. Moreover, the estimated coefficients for both
ΔMARRIED and (ΔMARRIED)2 are negative, which indicates that policyholders who experience
changes in marital status are more likely to keep the existing policy. This is again counterfactual;
we will again show in Table 9a below that once we introduce serially unobserved state variables
in our model, we will find that individuals who experience changes in bequest motives are more
likely to re-optimize.

without serially correlated unobservable state variables does a fairly good job at predicting the
aggregate distribution of choices, but there appears to be a dynamic effect which our model is
not capturing. Specifically, the actual data exhibits that, in the aggregate, there is a sharp increase
in the likelihood over time of holding no life insurance. This pattern does not appear to be fully
captured by our model. The simulation of the model predicts that the fraction of individuals
without life insurance would increase from 17.64% in 1996 to 24.74% in 2006 (in contrast to an
increase of 11.92% in 1996 to 21.36% in 2006 in the data).
In Panel B of Table 8, we report the comparison between the simulated model predictions of
the cumulative outcomes for individuals who owned life insurance in 1994 by wave and those in
the data. In the actual data, the cumulative fraction of 1994 policyholders lapsing to no insurance
steadily increases over time, going from 4.55% in 1996 to 23.40% by 2006. The model simulation
is not able to replicate the initially low lapsation rates. The model also under-predicts by a large
margin the cumulative fraction of the 1994 policyholders who kept their policies.17

Estimates from Dynamic Discrete Choice Model with Unobserved
State Variables
As we showed in the previous section, the dynamic model without serially correlated unob-

servable state variables fails to match the dynamic persistence in both the aggregate choice probabilities and cumulative outcomes. We suspect that some of these idiosyncratic factors may not be
so idiosyncratic at all. In particular, if there are serially correlated unobservables, such as unobserved components of bequest motive or liquidity shocks, then our model will fall short in explaining the empirical determinants of lapsation. Indeed, our simulations seem to over-forecast lapsation due to no longer needing life insurance and under-forecast lapsation due to re-optimization,
indicating the presence of some persistent unobservable that positively influences the likelihood
of needing life insurance. In this section, we fully go back to the empirical framework we presented earlier in Section 3, which explicitly takes into account the presence of unobserved state
variables. In particular, we add three unobserved state variables: 𝑧1 , 𝑧2 and 𝑧3 , that are meant to
represent the serially-correlated unobservable components of income, heath and bequest motive,
17

In un-reported counterfactual simulations we find that elimination of marital shocks has a larger effect on lapsation
patterns than elimination of income shock. Elimination of marital shocks reduces the share of policies lapsing to no
insurance, as well as the share of policies which are re-optimized. Elimination of income shocks reduces the share of
policies lapsing to none, but increases the share of policies which are re-optimized. The increase in re-optimization is
due to the fact that income is generally going down for individuals of our age range.
However, our counterfactual simulations also show that elimination of either of these shocks has an economically
insignificant impact on the aggregate lapsation patterns. Most of the lapsation in our data seems to be driven by
unobserved, idiosyncratic factors. This is not surprising given that marital status and income are not very volatile in
our data.

25

respectively. Below we first describe how we anchor the interpretations of these unobservable
state variables.

5.1

Anchoring the Unobserved State Variables
In this specification, we would like to give the unobserved state variable 𝑧1 the interpretation

as an unobserved liquidity (or income) shock, and normalize its unit to the same as log income, and 𝑧2
the interpretation as an unobserved health shock that is normalized to the units of health conditions,
and finally 𝑧3 the interpretation as an unobserved component of bequest motive that is normalized to
the units of marital status.
We assume that the initial distribution in 1994 (which we set to be 𝑡 = 0) for each of these
unobserved variables is degenerate and given by:18
𝑧1𝑖0 = 𝜃20 ℎ𝑖0 ,

(16)

𝑧2𝑖0 = 𝜃21 ℎ𝑖0 ,

(17)

𝑧3𝑖0 = 𝜃22 ℎ𝑖0 ,

(18)

where ℎ𝑖0 is an indicator dummy for whether the individual reported owning life insurance in
1994. In order to anchor 𝑧1 , 𝑧2 and 𝑧3 to have the desired interpretation given above, we expect,
but do not restrict, that the coefficients 𝜃20 , 𝜃21 and 𝜃22 to be of certain signs. For example, because
income is a positive factor for life insurance ownership, we expect that the sign of 𝜃20 to be positive, so that individuals who owned life insurance in the initial period also have higher 𝑧1 . This
anchors the interpretation of 𝑧1 as an unobserved component of income. Similarly, because being
married is also a positive factor for life insurance ownership, we also expect the sign of 𝜃22 to be
positive, so that individuals who owned life insurance in the initial period also have higher values
of unobserved bequest motive 𝑧3 .
The second channel that anchors the unobserved state variables to having the desired interpretation is incorporated in our specifications for 𝑢1 (⋅) and 𝑐 (⋅) , as formulated in (4) and (5).
Note that we restricted 𝑧1𝑖 to entering both 𝑢1 (⋅) and 𝑐 (⋅) in the same way as L OGINCOME, 𝑧2𝑖
the same way as C ONDITIONS, and 𝑧3𝑖 the same way as M ARRIED. These restrictions, together
with the sequential Monte Carlo method (described in the next section below) we use to simulate
the distributions of z𝑡 ≡ (𝑧1𝑡 , 𝑧2𝑡 , 𝑧3𝑡 ) , ensures that the unobserved variables z𝑡 have the desired
interpretations.
If we know the distributions of the unobservable state vectors (z𝑡 , ẑ𝑡 ) , solving this model is
18

The assumption that the initial distribution of the unobservable state variables z0 is degenerate is for computational
simplicity.

26

done no differently from that in section 4. Given a vector of parameters 𝜽 = (𝜃0 , ..., 𝜃19 ) , we can
compute the value functions at each age through backward recursion. The difficulty of handling
unobserved state variables comes during estimation, because we have to integrate over the unobservables when computing the likelihood. We now turn our attention to this problem.

5.2

Using Sequential Monte Carlo Method to Simulate the Distributions of the
Unobserved State Variables
We use Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method to simulate the distributions of the unobserv-

able state vectors.19 SMC is a set of simulation-based methods which provides a convenient and attractive approach to computing the posterior distributions of involving non-Gaussian, non-linear,
and high dimensional random variables.20 A thorough discussion of the method, from both the
theoretical and the practical perspectives, is available in Doucet, de Freitas and Gordon (2001). The
SMC method has been widely used in fields such as speech recognition, biology, and physics, etc.
Despite the obvious potential importance of serially correlated unobservable state variables, there
are only few applications of SMC in the economics literature. Fernandez-Villaverde and RubioRamirez (2007) used SMC for estimating macroeconomic dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
models with serially correlated unobservable state variables using a likelihood approach. Blevins
(2011) proposed the use of SMC to allow for serially correlated unobservable state variables in
estimating dynamic single agent models and dynamic games. Hong, Gallant and Khwaja (2008)
also discusses the method in an application to the pharmaceuticals industry. All of the papers
allow for a single serially correlated unobservable state variable. In our application, as we have
mentioned above, we believe that there might be important serially unobservable components for
each of the three potential sources of lapsation, shocks to income, health and bequest motives.
Now we provide a detailed discussion about the SMC. For a given individual, we observe the
sequence of choices {𝑑𝑡 }𝑇𝑡=0 , observed state variables {𝑥𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑡 }𝑇𝑡=0 , and whether the individual had
life insurance in 1994 ℎ0 . The data set is thus {𝑑𝑡 , 𝑥𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑡 , ℎ0 }𝑇𝑡=0 (we have dropped the 𝑖 subscript
for convenience). Let 𝑝(𝑑0:𝑇 ∣𝑥0:𝑇 , 𝑥
ˆ0:𝑇 , ℎ0 ) denote the conditional likelihood of the observed data.
We can write:
𝑝(𝑑0:𝑇 ∣𝑥0:𝑇 , 𝑥
ˆ0:𝑇 , ℎ0 ) = 𝑝(𝑑0 ∣𝑥0 , 𝑥
ˆ0 , ℎ0 )

𝑇
∏

𝑝(𝑑𝑡 ∣𝑑𝑡−1 , 𝑥𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑡 )

(19)

𝑡=1
19

SMC algorithms are also called bootstrap filters, particle filters, and sequential importance samplers with resampling.
20
SMC for non-linear, non-Gaussian models is the analog of Kalman filter for linear, Gaussian models. Gordon,
Salmond and Smith (1993) is the seminal paper that proposed this algorithm, which they refer to as the bootstrap filter.

27

Because the initial distribution of z0 is degenerate and depends only on ℎ0 , we can write:
𝑝(𝑑0 ∣𝑥0 , 𝑥
ˆ0 , ℎ0 ) = 𝑝(𝑑0 ∣𝑥0 , 𝑥
ˆ0 , z0 ).
Assuming we have solved for the value functions in a first stage, we should be able to compute
𝑝(𝑑0 ∣𝑥0 , 𝑥
ˆ0 , z0 ).
Now, for each 𝑡 > 0 we can write:
∫
𝑝(𝑑𝑡 ∣𝑑𝑡−1 , 𝑥𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑡 ) =

𝑝(𝑑𝑡 ∣𝑑𝑡−1 , 𝑥𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑡 , z𝑡 , ẑ𝑡 )𝑝(z𝑡 , ẑ𝑡 ∣𝑑𝑡−1 )𝑑z𝑡 𝑑ẑ𝑡 .

(20)

We know how to compute 𝑝(𝑑𝑡 ∣𝑑𝑡−1 , 𝑥𝑡 , 𝑥
ˆ𝑡 , z𝑡 , ẑ𝑡 ) for a given set of parameter values 𝜽. What we
need is a method to draw from 𝑝(z𝑡 , ẑ𝑡 ∣𝑑𝑡−1 ); and we use Sequential Monte Carlo method for this
purpose.
SMC is a recursive algorithm that begins by drawing a swarm of particles approximating the
initial distribution of the hidden state. The initial swarm is then used to draw a swarm for the
next period, and this swarm is then filtered according to sequential importance weights.
The unobservables transition according to the following equations:
𝑧1𝑖𝑡 = 𝜃23 𝑧1𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝜃24 𝜖𝑧1 𝑡 ,

(21)

𝑧2𝑖𝑡 = 𝜃25 𝑧2𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝜃26 𝜖𝑧2 𝑡 ,

(22)

𝑧3𝑖𝑡 = 𝜃27 𝑧3𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝜃28 𝜖𝑧3 𝑡 ,

(23)

where 𝜖𝑧1 𝑡 , 𝜖𝑧2 𝑡 and 𝜖𝑧3 𝑡 are is an i.i.d. random variable with standard normal distribution 𝒩 (0, 1).
The transition distribution of the observed state variables are given by 𝑃 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ∣𝑥𝑖𝑡−1 ) as in section
4.21
The filtered particles are then used to draw another swarm for the next period, and so on.
In the following notation, we will absorb ẑ into z and use z to denote any unobserved variable,
including the “hatted” z’s.
The method proceeds as follows:
0. Set 𝑡 = 0, draw a swarm of particles

from the initial distribution 𝑝(z0 ). This

distribution must be parametrically assumed, with potentially unknown parameters. In our
case it is assumed to be degenerate as described by (16)-(18). Set 𝑡 = 1.

Thus, we do not allow the transitions of the observed state variables to depend on the realization of the unobserved
state variables.

This distribution is known because we have imposed a parametric specification on it. The
previous period’s choice, 𝑑𝑡−1 , is required because that determines how the “hatted” z’s
evolve. The swarm of particles {z̃𝑡,𝑟 }𝑅

Figure 1 presents a graphical representation of the SMC algorithm. In the graph, we assume
away for simplicity the unobservable state vectors carried from the last re-optimization period ẑ𝑡
{
}
(𝑟)
for simplicity. The SMC starts at time 𝑡 − 1 with an un-weighted measure z̃𝑡−1 , 𝑅−1 , which provides an approximation of 𝑝 (z𝑡−1 ∣𝑑1:𝑡−2 ) . For each particle, we compute the importance weights
using the information about the actual choice 𝑑𝑡−1 at time 𝑡 − 1 with the weights given by the

model’s prediction of the likelihood 𝑝 𝑑𝑡−1 ∣z̃𝑡−1 of observing 𝑑𝑡−1 when the particle is z̃𝑡−1 ,

properly re-normalized. This results in the weighted measure z̃𝑡−1 , 𝑤
˜𝑡−1 , which yields an approximation of 𝑝 (z𝑡−1 ∣𝑑1:𝑡−1 ) . Subsequently, the re-sampling with replacement (or the selection)
{
}
(𝑟)
step selects only the fittest particles to obtain the un-weighted measure z𝑡−1 , 𝑅−1 , which is still
an approximation of 𝑝 (z𝑡−1 ∣𝑑1:𝑡−1 ) . Finally, the prediction step draws new varieties of particles
{
}
(𝑟)
from the parametric process 𝑝 (z𝑡 ∣z𝑡−1 ) , resulting in the measure z̃𝑡 , 𝑅−1 , which is an approx{

imation of 𝑝 (z𝑡 ∣𝑑1:𝑡−1 ) . The measures z̃𝑡−1 , 𝑅−1 and z̃𝑡 , 𝑅−1 are the posterior distributions
of the unobservables we use in the numerical integration of the choice probabilities (20).
At each iteration, we computed the per period probability of observing the data given by
equation (20) . Because this is done iteratively, starting from 𝑡 = 0, we can eventually work our
way up to 𝑡 = 𝑇 and compute the entire likelihood given by (19). Repeating this process for each
individual for the data will give us the entire likelihood of the data. We can then estimate the
parameters via maximum likelihood.22
We use simulated maximum likelihood method to estimate the parameters of 𝑢1 (⋅) , 𝑐 (⋅), the
initial values of 𝑧1 , 𝑧2 and 𝑧3 , namely 𝜃20 -𝜃22 as described in (16)-(18), as well as their AR(1) autocorrelation coefficients and variance terms 𝜃23 -𝜃28 as described in (21)-(23). We compute the standard errors using a bootstrap procedure. In each iteration of the procedure, a new random seed

We employed 64 particles in each swarm to integrate out the z’s when computing the conditional choice probabilities. We use 40 articles when computing the expected future value term. One evaluation of the likelihood takes about
2 minutes on an 8-core, 2.5GHz, 64 bit AMD computer while using all 8 CPUs, and the entire estimation routine took
about 4 days when starting from an initial guess of all zeros.

is used to create a bootstrapped sample of individuals from the original roster. The structural
parameters are then re-estimated using this bootstrapped sample. 50 bootstrapped samples were
used. For each structural parameter, the standard error is calculated as the standard deviation of
the estimates from the 50 bootstrapped samples.23

Estimation Results
Tables 9a and 9b present the estimation results. Panel A shows the estimated coefficients for

𝑢1 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) as specified in (4). There are several important changes in the estimated coefficients
relative to those for the model without serially correlated unobservables as in Table 7. First, the
estimated coefficient on (M ARRIED + 𝑧3 ) in Table 9a is negative, in contrast to that in Table 7; however, the estimated coefficient for the term (M ARRIED + 𝑧3 )2 is positive and statistically significant
in 9a (recall that in Table 7 the term M ARRIED2 was perfectly correlated with M ARRIED and thus
had to be dropped). Thus the overall effect from the estimates in Table 9a is still that married individuals are more likely than divorced or widowed individuals to own life insurance. Second, in
23

See Olsson and Rydén (2008) for a discussion about the asymptotic performance of approximate maximum likelihood estimators for state space models obtained via sequential Monte Carlo methods. It provides criteria for how to
increase the number of particles and the resolution of the grid in order to produce estimates that are consistent and
asymptotically normal.

contrast to that in Table 7, with unobservable state variables the estimates of (L OGINCOME + 𝑧1 )
and (L OGINCOME + 𝑧1 )2 are both positive and significant, though the qualitative effect of Log
income on the probability of purchasing life insurance is the same in the two models in the relevant ranges of income in our data. Third, the estimated coefficient for (C ONDITIONS + 𝑧2 )2 is
now positive and significant in contrast to that in Table 7 where the estimate for C ONDITIONS2
was negative and insignificant. Except for these differences, the other parameter estimates are
consistent across the two models.
Panel B in Table 9a presents the estimated coefficients for 𝑐 ((𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) , (ˆ
𝑥𝑖𝑡 , 𝑧ˆ𝑖𝑡 )) as specified in
(5). There are several important changes in the estimates for 𝑐 (⋅) when unobservable state variables are included. In contrast to the estimates in Table 7 for the model without serially correlated
unobservables, the coefficient estimate for Δ (C ONDITIONS + 𝑧2 ) is now negative (-0.0443) and
that for (Δ (C ONDITIONS + 𝑧2 ))2 is positive (0.0060), and both are statistically significant. This
implies that individuals who experience negative health shocks tend to have lower values of the
sub-optimality penalty 𝑐 (⋅) and thus are more likely to keep the existing policy. As we mentioned
in the previous section, this is consistent with the empirical findings in He (2010) and the theoretical predictions of Hendel and Lizzeri (2003).
Also importantly, once we incorporate serially-correlated unobservables, the coefficient estimates for both Δ (M ARRIED + 𝑧3 ) and (Δ (M ARRIED + 𝑧3 ))2 are now positive (0.0136 and 0.0284,
respectively) and significant in 𝑐 (⋅) . This implies that changes in marital status and other unobservables related to bequest motives will increase the sub-optimality penalty and lead policyholders to adjust their life insurances by either lapsing into no coverage or re-optimizing their
coverages. This is much more plausible than the implications from the estimates without unobservable state variables we discussed in the previous section. The other parameter estimates in
Table 9a are similar to those in Table 7.
Panels C in Table 9b presents the estimated initial distributions of the three unobservables
𝑧10 , 𝑧20 and 𝑧30 as related to the indicator of whether the individuals owned life insurance in 1994
as specified in (16)-(18). The positive estimates for coefficients 𝜃20 in (16) and 𝜃22 in (18) indicate
that those who owned life insurance policies in 1994 tend to have values of unobservable income
and bequest motives; on the other hand, the negative estimate of coefficient 𝜃21 in (17) indicates
that the policyholders in 1994 tends to be healthier. This somewhat surprising result is consistent
with the findings in Cawley and Philipson (1999), and most likely reflects survivorship bias as
explained in He (2009) and He (2010).
Panel D in Table 9b presents the estimates of the coefficients of the autoregressive processes
described in (21)-(23). The estimates for coefficients 𝜃23 , 𝜃25 and 𝜃27 are all positive and significant
(both economically and statistically), suggesting that the unobservable income, health and bequest

Model Fit
Table 10 presents an assessment of the performance of the dynamic model with serially cor-

related unobservable state variables. We report in Panel A of Table 10 the comparisons between
the simulated model predictions regarding aggregate choice probabilities by wave and those in
the data. Relative to the model fit reported in Table 8, by incorporating serially correlated unobservable state variables, we are able to dramatically improve the model’s ability to capture the
dynamic patterns in the actual data. That is, the actual data exhibits that, in the aggregate, there is
an increasing likelihood over time of holding no life insurance, which the model without serially
correlated unobservable state variables was unable to capture (see Section 4). Indeed our simulation is able to replicate the increase in the fraction of individuals without life insurance coverage
from 12.12% in 1996 to 22.86% in 2006, an increase that almost matches what is in the actual data
(from 11.92% in 1996 to 21.36% in 2006).
In Panel B of Table 10, we report the comparison between the simulated model predictions of
the cumulative outcomes for individuals who owned life insurance in 1994 by wave and those
in the data. Again, by incorporating serially correlated unobservable state variables, we are able
to capture the pattern of steadily increasing cumulative fraction of 1994 policyholders lapsing to
no insurance in the actual data. In the data, this cumulative fraction went from 4.55% in 1996 to
23.39% by 2006; in our simulation, it goes from 4.59% in 1996 to 23.43% in 2006. In contrast, recall
that in Table 8, the model without serially correlated unobservables is unable to replicate the initially low lapsation rates. Panel B of Table 10 also shows that by incorporating serially correlated
unobservables, we are able to significantly improve the fit of the cumulative fraction of 1994 policyholders who kept their policies, whereas the model without serially-correlated unobservables
under-predicts these by large margin (see Section 4).

Counterfactual Simulations
In this section, we report the results from a large number of counterfactual simulations to

address two importance questions. The first set of counterfactual simulations highlights the importance of serially-correlated unobserved state variables in explaining the patterns of life insurance decisions observed in the data. The second set of counterfactual simulations attempts to
disentangle the contributions of income, health and bequest motives shocks, both observed and
unobserved in explaining the observed lapsations.

It is useful to emphasize at the outset the nature of our counterfactual simulations. When we
remove the shocks, we are assuming that the market environment faced by consumers remain
unchanged from when all shocks are present. That is, our counterfactual simulation does not
allow for the market to re-equilibrate to respond to the fact that there are now fewer shocks. In
particular, we must assume that the choice set of life insurance contracts that each individual faces
in a given state does not change. Thus our counterfactual simulations are in some sense purely an
exercise in accounting.

6.1

The Importance of Serially-Correlated Unobserved State Variables
In this section, we report a series of counterfactual simulations to demonstrate the importance

of including serially-correlated unobservable state variables. Panel A of Table 11 is identical to the
bottom sub-panel of Panel B in Table 10 and it reports the model’s predictions about the cumulative outcomes for 1994 policyholders.
In Panel B of Table 11, we report the predictions of the model using the coefficient estimates as
reported in Panel A and B of Table 9a, but under the counterfactual assumption that the unobservable state variables did not change over time. It shows that without the shocks to the unobserved
state variables, the model is unable to match the sharply increasing cumulative fraction of 1994
policyholders that lapse to no life insurance, and the model also over-predicts by a large margin
the cumulative fraction of 1994 policyholders who kept their 1994 coverage.
In Panel C of Table 11, we report the predictions of the model using the coefficient estimates
as reported in Table 9a, but under the counterfactual assumption that the observable state variables
stayed the same as their values in 1994, except for age, while keeping the changes in the unobserved state variables. Surprisingly, assuming away the changes in the observable state variables
barely changes the model’s predictions about the cumulative outcomes for 1994 policyholders.
In Panel D, we report the predictions of the model using the coefficient estimates of the model
as reported in Panel A and B of Table 9a, but under the counterfactual assumption that the neither
the unobservable state variables nor the observed state variables (except for age) change over time.
Only i.i.d choice specific shocks are retained in these simulations. The predictions in Panel D are
very similar to Panel B where only changes in unobservable state variables are eliminated.
The counterfactual simulations in Table 11 thus provide very strong evidence for the importance of serially correlated unobservable state variables in explaining the choice patterns in the
data. Qualitatively, it plays a much more important role than the variations in the observable state
variables in capturing the key features in the data.

Disentangling the Contribution of Income, Health and Bequest Motive Shocks
to Lapsations
In this section, we present a series of counterfactual simulations aimed at disentangling the

contributions of income, health and bequest shocks, including both observed and unobserved
components, to the lapsations of life insurance policies observed in the data. We present our results in four panels in Table 12. There are two sub-panels in Panels A-C. Let us first discuss Panel
A, which illustrates the contribution of income shocks to the lapsation of 1994 policyholders. In
the shaded sub-panel, we use as baseline the model’s prediction of the cumulative lapsation rates
of 1994 policyholders when only i.i.d choice specific shocks are present (the first row), and examine how the additional of income shocks to the i.i.d choice specific shocks increases the model’s
predicted lapsation rates (the second row).24 Notice that the addition of income shocks to the i.i.d
choice specific shocks lead to more lapsation. The incremental contribution of income shocks accounts for about 6.75% of the total lapsations predicted by the model when all shocks are included
in 1996.25 The incremental contributions of income shocks over time are reported in the third row.
It reveals that the importance of income shocks are increasing over time in explaining lapsations.
By 2006, income shocks alone were able to explain about 12.89% of the predicted lapsations.
The bottom, un-shaded, sub-panel in Panel A uses a different baseline. The baseline is instead
the model’s prediction of lapsation rates when all but incomes shocks are included (reported in
the fourth row of Panel A). This baseline prediction is contrasted to the predicted lapsation rates
when all shocks are included (fifth row of Panel A). The difference is attributed to the incremental
contribution of income shocks (sixth row of Panel A). Using this baseline, we see that the contribution of income shocks to lapsation is also increasing over time, increasing from 9.59% in 1996 to
33.63% in 2006.26
Panel B of Table 12 carries analogous calculations to illustrate the contribution of health shocks
to the lapsations of 1994 life insurance policyholders. The shaded sub-panel shows that if we
use the predicted lapsations with only i.i.d choice specific shocks as the baseline, the incremental
contribution from adding health shocks using this baseline is more or less stable over time, staying
24

Note that the first row numbers in Panel A of Table 12 are identical to the numbers in the first row of Panel D of
Table 11.
25
That is, (0.0384 − 0.0353) /0.0459 ≈ 6.75% where 0.0459 is lapsation rates predicted by the model when all shocks
are included (reported in the fifth row of the table, as well as Panel B of Table 10). The other percentages are calculated
analogously.
26
There are two other possible counterfactual baselines that we do not report. We could have used “i.i.d choice
specific shock and health shocks” as baseline and contrast it with “i.i.d choice specific shock, health shocks and income
shocks” (which is the same as “all but bequest motive shocks”). Alternatively, we could have used “i.i.d choice specific
shock and bequest motive shocks” as the baseline and contrast it with “i.i.d choice specific shock, bequeest motive
shocks and income shocks” (which is the same as “all but health shocks”). Note that the information needed to carry
out these calculations is presented in other rows in Table 12. For space reasons, we do not present these calculations
separately.

39

at about 12% throughout the years. If we use the predicted lapsations when all but health shocks
are included as the baseline, the incremental contribution from adding health shocks goes from
15.90% in 1996 to 31% in 2006.
Panel C of Table 12 shows the contribution of bequest motive shocks to life insurance lapsations. As in Panels A and B, the top shaded sub-panel calculates the incremental contribution
of bequest motive shocks using the predicted lapsations with only i.i.d choice specific shocks as
the baseline, and the bottom sub-panel uses the predicted lapsations with all shocks except for
bequest shocks as the baseline. We find that the importance of bequest motives in explaining lapsation increases over time. In 1996 the bequest motive shocks explain between -0.22% to 3.27% of
the lapsation; but by 2006, it explains between 11.99% to 34.87% of the lapsation.
Panel D of Table 12 bounds the contributions of i.i.d choice specific shocks in explaining the
lapsations. The lower bounds are calculated as the residuals after subtracting the upper bound
contributions from income, health and bequest motive shocks.27 Panel D reveals that lapsation
of life insurance policies are largely driven by i.i.d choice specific shocks for younger individuals,
but for surviving policyholders an ever larger fraction of lapsations is explained by either income,
or health, or bequest motive shocks. By 2006, between more than 1/3 to almost 100 percent of the
lapsations are driven by one of these shocks.
To summarize, the simulations reported in Table 12 indicate that when individuals are young,
most of the life insurance policy lapsations are driven by i.i.d choice specific shocks, and the rest
is explained, in descending order of importance, by health shocks and income shocks; the bequest
motive shocks only account for very minor fraction of the lapsations. However, as policyholders
get older, the importance of the i.i.d choice specific shocks declines dramatically, and the three
shocks eventually account for about the same fraction of the lapsations (ranging from about 12%
to around 30%). If anything, the bequest motive shocks are more important in explaining the
lapsations than the income and health shocks.
Policy Implications.

Our findings above regarding the contributions of income, health and be-

quest motive shocks, as well as the i.i.d choice specific shocks, to the lapsations of the 1994 policyholders have some implications regarding the possible effects of the emerging life settlement
market on consumer welfare. As we mentioned in the Introduction, theoretical studies by Daily,
Hendel and Lizzeri (2008), Fang and Kung (2010a) and Fang and Kung (2010b) show that the
reasons for lapsation are importantly related to whether life settlement market can improve consumer welfare. Specifically, Fang and Kung (2010b) shows that a key determinant for whether
27

For example, we obtain 71.24% lower bound number for year 1996 from 1 − 9.59% − 15.90% − 3.27% where 9.59%,
15.90% and 3.27% are respectively the upperbound contributions of income, health and bequest motive shocks reported
in Panels A to C. The other bounds are calculated analogously.

40

consumers may benefit from life settlement market is whether lapsation is driven by factors that
are positively correlated to the marginal utility of income. Thus, to the extent we found in Section
5.3 that decreases in log income lead to a higher probability of lapsation, and decreases in log
income certainly lead to higher marginal utility of income, the fraction of lapsations that can be
attributed to changes in income, both observed and unobserved, should be a potential source of
welfare gain for consumers when life settlement market is introduced. On the other hand, lapsations driven by i.i.d choice specific shocks are not positively correlated to the marginal utility
of income, and thus life settlement market will likely lead to a reduction of consumer welfare.
Analogously, to the extent that health shocks and bequest motive shocks are orthogonal to the income shocks, and are thus not necessarily positively correlated to the marginal utility of income,
we suspect that the fractions of lapsation attributable to these two shocks are likely sources for
consumer welfare reduction when life settlement is introduced.
Our finding that i.i.d choice specific shocks explain the bulk of the policy lapsation when individuals are relatively young (when they are in early 60s) thus suggests that life settlement is likely
to lead to welfare loss for relative young policyholders; but may lead to welfare gain for older
policyholders in their early seventies, as changes in income become a more important source for
lapsation. We should emphasize, however, these are only suggestive implications from our analysis; a more definite study for the welfare effect of the life settlement market would require that we
estimate a fully structural model of the behavior of both the consumers who choose life insurance
policies and the life insurance companies who offer such policies.

6.3

Discussion
We now discuss two important issues. The first issue is about the identification of the three

components of the serially-correlated unobservable state variables intended to capture income,
health and bequest motive shocks. As we mentioned in the Introduction, this is to the best of
our knowledge the first paper that allowed for more than one unobservable state variables. So a
natural question is whether such unobservable state variables can be separately identified. This
is obviously an important question to be addressed in future research. For now, we would first
like to emphasize that in this paper, we tried to anchor the interpretation of these three shocks by
restricting that each has the same effect on behavior as their respective observable counterparts
(see Section 5.1).
Secondly, we also estimated a series of alternative models where we include only a subset of
the three shocks. In the same spirit of Heckman and Singer (1984) for the case of unobserved types,
we ask whether the inclusion of additional unobserved state variables increase the log-likelihood
of the estimated model. In Table 13, we report the log-likelihood of the estimated models with

various specifications of the unobservable shocks. In particular, the specification labeled “All”
corresponds to the model estimated in Section 5 where we include all three unobservable state
variables, and the specification labeled “None” corresponds to the model estimated in Section 4
where we do not include any unobservable state variables. In specifications labeled “1” to “6”,
various combinations of the three unobservable state variables are included in the estimation.
From the last column in Table 13, we can see that the inclusion of the additional unobservable state
variables significantly increases the log-likelihood of the models. For example, in the specifications
”4”-”6”, we estimated models with only one of the unobservable state variables respectively. The
log-likelihoods of these models improve over specification ”None”. Similarly, in specifications
”1”-”3”, we estimated models with two of the three unobservable state variables; and again, the
log-likelihoods of these models improve over specifications with only one of the unobservables.
Finally, the log-likelihood of the model with all three shocks is higher than specification ”1”-”3”.
The results in Table 13 suggest that indeed the data seems to be more consistent with the model
with all three serially-correlated unobserved state variables.
The second issue is regarding our finding that the importance of the unobserved state variables
in explaining lapsation increases over time. The concern is whether this is a mechanical result due
to the way we simulate the unobservable state variables using SMC. In particular, recall that the
initial distribution of the unobservable state variables are assumed to have smaller support than
in later periods (see Sections 5.1 and 5.2). While this is a possibility, we would like to make two
counter-arguments. First, even though the unobservable state variables in the earlier periods have
smaller support (in fact, just one point support in the initial period), these points in the support
were chosen to best fit the data; thus there is no a priori reason that the unobservable state variables
42

in the early periods should have less impact just because they have a small support. Second, if
the simulated unobservable state variables were pure noise that the individuals do not take into
account, then the unobservables’ importance in explaining the observed lapsations should not
have changed over time at all, that is, the importance should be about zero in all periods. Thus
the fact that the importance of the unobservable state variables were found to be increasing over
time is an indication that these simulated unobservable state variables are capturing something
informative.

Conclusion
In this paper, we empirically investigate the contributions of income, health and bequest mo-

tive shocks to life insurance lapsations. We present a dynamic discrete choice model of life insurance decisions allowing for serially correlated unobservable state variables. The model is designed
to deal with the data reality where researchers only observe whether an individual has made a new
life insurance decision (i.e., purchased a new policy, or added to/changed an existing policy) but
do not observe the actual policy choice or the choice set from which the new policy is selected.
The semi-structural dynamic discrete choice model allows us to bypass these data limitations. We
empirically implement the model using the limited life insurance holding information from the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data.
We deal with serially correlated unobserved state variables using posterior distributions of
the unobservables simulated from Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. Relative to the few
existing papers in the economics literature that has used similar SMC methods, our paper is the
first to incorporate multi-dimensional serially correlated unobserved state variables. In order to
give the three unobservable state variables in our empirical model their desired interpretations as
unobserved income, health and bequest motive shocks, this paper proposes two channels through
which we can anchor these unobservables to their related observable variables. We present our
estimation results separately for dynamic models without and with serially correlated unobservable state variables. We illustrate the importance of serially correlated unobservables by showing
the features in the data that a dynamic model without unobservable state variables is unable to
capture, and how with unobservable state variables the model fit dramatically improves (c.f. Tables 8 and 10). We also show that in the model with unobserved state variables, the contribution
of the shocks to unobservables is much larger than the contribution of the shocks to observed state
variables (Table 11).
Our estimates for the model with serially correlated unobservable state variables are sensible
and yield implications about individuals’ life insurance decisions consistent with the both intu43

ition and existing empirical results. In a series of counterfactual simulations reported in Table 12,
we find that a large fraction of life insurance lapsations are driven by i.i.d choice specific shocks,
particularly when policyholders are relatively young. But as the remaining policyholders get
older, the role of such i.i.d. shocks gets less important, and more of their lapsations are driven
either by income, health or bequest motive shocks. Income and health shocks are relatively more
important than bequest motive shocks in explaining lapsation when policyholders are young, but
as they age, the bequest motive shocks play a more important role.
Our empirical findings have important implications regarding the effect of the life settlement
industry on consumer welfare. As shown in theoretical analysis in Daily, Hendel and Lizzeri
(2008) and Fang and Kung (2010a,b), the theoretical predictions about the effect of life settlement
on consumer welfare crucially depend on why life insurance policyholders lapse their policies.
If bequest motive shocks are the reason for their lapsations, then the life settlement industry is
shown to reduce consumer welfare in equilibrium; but if income shocks are the reason for their
lapsations, then life settlements may increase consumer welfare. To the extent that we find both
income shocks and bequest motive shocks play important roles in explaining life insurance lapsations, particularly among the elderly population targeted by the life settlement industry, our
research suggests that the effect of life settlement on consumer welfare might be ambiguous. Unfortunately, our “semi-structural” partial equilibrium model of life insurance decisions and the
life insurance market, which is necessitated by data limitations, is not suited for carrying out a
quantitative evaluation of how the introduction of the life settlement market impacts consumer
welfare, taking into account the presence of both the income-driven and bequest-motive-driven
lapsations. This is an important, but challenging, area for future research.
