NBER Working Paper #645
March 1981
The Relative Stability of Money and Credit "Velocities" in the United States:
Evidence and Some Speculations

ABSTRACT

Is credit as closely related to income as is money? Results presented in the first half of this paper, based on a variety of methodological
approaches, consistently indicate that the aggregate of outstanding credit
liabilities of all nonfinancial borrowers in the United States bears as
close a relationship to U.S. nonfinancial activity as do the more familiar
asset aggregates like the money stock (however measured) or the monetary
base. In contrast to the asset aggregates, however, which exhibit little
overall difference among themselves in this context, total nonfinancial
indebtedness appears to be unique among credit aggregates in bearing this
close relationship to income.
Moreover, additional evidence of offsetting
movements of the public and private components of total nonfinancial
indebtedness further substantiates the case for stability in the aggregate.
The second half of the paper suggests three hypotheses that provide
(1) an
internally consistent potential explanations for this phenomenon:
"ultrarationality" hypothesis which emphasizes acute perceptions and
offsetting actions on the part of the private sector, (2) a "capital
leveraging" hypothesis which emphasizes borrowing limitations and the
need for tangible collateral, and (3) an "asset demand" hypothesis which
emphasizes the private sector's role as a net lender. Initial efforts to
match these hypotheses against data for the U.S. household and corporate
business sectors yield only mixed results, however. The stability of the
credit—to—income relationship remains for the present a major puzzle,
therefore, although these three hypotheses do look sufficiently promising
to warrant a much closer investigation.

THE RELATIVE STABILITY OF MONEY AND CREDIT "VELOCITIES" IN THE UNITED STATES:
EVIDENCE AND SOME SPECULATIONS

Benjamin M. Friedxnan*

It is curious that economic analysis has traditionally placed so much

more emphasis on money than on credit.
In the simplest abstraction to an economy with no privately issued
financial instruments, there is no such thing as credit, and money exists

only in the form of government—issued base money. The relevance of such an
abstraction is questionable, however, in a context in which there exist not
only privately issued financial instruments but also a large quantity and
rich variety of institutions whose business consists almost exclusively of

issuing and holding such instruments. In an actual economy like that of the
United States, most money is in fact not base money but bank money, and

privately issued financial instruments constitute the great majority of all

financial instruments held. Of course it is always possible to proceed on
the assumption that privately issued financial instruments exist but do not
matter much, so that the economy's privately issued liabilities simply offset
the remainder of its financial assets, and base money is once again all that
matters for economic activity beyond some level of disaggregated detail.

Although there have been some proponents of such a view,' it is nonetheless
inconsistent with the emphasis more typically placed on bank money as well
as base money in most analysis.
Once the analysis moves beyond an exclusive focus on base money,

however — thereby acknowledging that financial intermediation not only

—2—

exists but also matters — economic theory provides no a priori reason
whatever to suspect a role for the nonbank public's money holdings but not

its credit liabilities. For given growth in base money, the behavior of the
banking system as well as of the nonbank public determines the growth of
both bank money and bank credit, and does so jointly with the determination

of the growth of nonbank financial instruments and of nonfinancial economic

activity. In theoretical analysis there is no justification for paying
attention •to the "money" side of this process while disregarding the "credit"

side. In applied analysis the most familiar argument for emphasizing money
while disregarding credit usually rests on some kind of implicit empirical
judgment that, especially for the United States, the arbitrariness associated

with defining "credit" measures is significantly more troublesome than the

arbitrariness associated with defining "money" measures. In a standard
example, whether a particular credit extension goes through the banking
system or the commercial paper market (or even the long—term bond market) is

presumably at most a second—order matter. Recent developments have done much
to vitiate this familiar empirical judgment, however, and there now exist
substantial and rapidly growing anomalies on the "money" side that are fully
comparable to those that have long been familiar on the "credit" side.

Surely it is also a second—order matter whether the public holds bank—issued
money market certificates (enabling banks to make direct loans), in which
case "money" increases, or holds commercial paper via money market fund shares

that may be checkable but are excluded from "money" nonetheless. More broadly,
the conventional inclusion in "money" of non—deposit claims against deposit—
issuing institutions (for example, seven—year saving certificates) contrasts
oddly with the exclusion of fully liquid claims against everyone else.

This paper's point of departure is the simple observation that, in

—3—

the United States during the post World War II period, the total amount of
debt claims issued in the credit markets by all nonfinancial participants in
the economy has born a remarkably stable

relationship to nonfinancial

economic activity as measured by gross national product

arguably, a more

stable relationship than that shown by the monetary base or by any of the
familiar "M" measures that include bank money. This observed stability of
the economy's aggregate nonfinancial debt ratio, taken by itself, is not

necessarily surprising. That makes it surprising, however, is that the
economy-wide total has been so stable despite wide variation in the debt
issuing activity of the different sectors of whose claims the total consists.
In particular, households and nonfinancial corporations have paced their
issuance of debt, in both the secular and the cyclical time frames, so as
almost exactly to offset the secular decline and cyclical variation in the
indebtedness of the federal government.

The paper's object is to make a beginning (for it is only that) toward
understanding the role that debt plays in the economic system and hence the

behavior underlying the observed stability of the debt-to—income relationship

in the United States. This line of research appears, at least at the outset,
to be of potential value in several regards in addition to the light it may

shed on more basic questions of economic

behavior. For example, some of the

hypotheses that may possibly explain the existence of a stable debt ratio
have fairly direct implications for whether fiscal policy either can provide

an effective economic stimulus or will merely "crowd out" private activity.
Similarly, some of these hypotheses bear implications

in the sense of the mix of debt and

for leverage structures,

equity by which individuals and businesses

in the private economy will finance their asset holdings. The results of
such research also have potential implications for the choice of target

—4—.

variables for monetary policy, especially under

the

currently prevalent

approach that employs some endogenous variable (like money) as an inter-

mediate policy target. Finally, a major objective of this line of inquiry

is to call into question — and, if appropriate, to redirect

the peculiar

balance—sheet asymmetry of current economic research that almost always

emphasizes money over credit, bank liabilities over bank assets, and public
assets over public liabilities.
Section I presents data for the U.S. economy's total nonfinancial
debt ratio and for its components by sector, and documents the ratio's
strong stability through comparisons based on several different methodologies.

Section II sketches the simple outlines of three alternative approaches to

explaining this phenomenon: specifically, an "ultrarationality" hypothesis,
a "capital leveraging" hypothesis, and an "asset demand" hypothesis.
Section III briefly inspects some evidence, based on U.S. household and

corporate sector balance sheet data, that may bear on the adequacy of these
possible explanations; it is important to emphasize at the outset, however,
that this paper stops well short of rigorously developing and testing any

specific hypothesis. Section IV briefly summarizes the paper's principal
findings, re—emphasizes some important caveats, and goes on to assess the

prospects for unravelling the underlying relationships among money, credit
and nonfinancial economic activity.

—5—

I. The Stability of the Total Debt Relationship
The Basic Data. Table 1 presents data showing the yearend indebtedness of U.S. nonfinancial borrowers, as a ratio to fourth—quarter gross
national product (and multiplied by 100), for each of the twenty—six years
in the standard sample period beginning after the Treasury-Federal Reserve
Accord freed monetary policy from the wartime constraint of supporting

government bond prices. The first column of the table shows the total

credit market indebtedness of all U.S. nonfinancial borrowers. The next
five columns present comparable data dividing this total into the respective

indebtedness of each of five specific borrowing sectors. The table's final
column shows, as a memorandum item, comparable data (not included in the
total in the first column) for the debt issued in U.S. markets by foreign

borrowers.2 Figure 1 plots the total nonfinancial debt ratio and its five
components by sector.

These data are "net" in the sense that they net out financial inter-

mediation. In other words, the data include such items as a household's
mortgage issued to a bank, or a corporation's bonds sold to an insurance
company, but they exclude any liability issued in turn by the bank or the

insurance company in order to finance that lending activity. The data also
exclude debt issued by separate financial subsidiaries of nonfinancial
corporations, as well as by federally sporsored credit agencies and mortgage

pools. The data are "gross," however, in the sense that they include all
of an individual household or firm's outstanding credit market liabilities,
not just any excess of liabilities over either financial or total assets,

and also in the sense that they include one household's borrowing from
another or one firm's borrowing from another.

—6—

The strong stability of the total nonfinancial debt ratio, shown in
the top line in Figure 1 and the first column of Table 1, stands out in stark

contrast to the variation of the individual sector components. The nonfinancial economy's reliance on debt, scaled in relation to economic activity,
has shown almost no trend and but little variation during the past quarter

century. During this period the total nonfinancial debt ratio has trended
slightly upward, with a low of 133.4 in 1956 and a high of 145.9 in 1964.
Not surprisingly, the ratio has also exhibited a slight cyclicality, typically
rising a point or two in recession years (when gross national product, in the

denominator, is weak). At 143.3, the most recent observation is nearly back
at the 1964 high.

The individual components of this total, however, have varied in

sharply different directions both secularly and cyclically. In brief, the
secular postwar rise in private debt has largely mirrored a substantial
decline, relative to economic activity, in public debt, while cyclical

bulges in public debt issuance have mostly had their counterpart in the

abatement of private borrowing. Households have almost continually increased
their reliance on debt in relation to their nonfinancial activity throughout

this period. Both corporations and unincorporated businesses have also
issued steadily more debt, on a relative basis, except for temporary

retrenchments during recession years. State and local governments steadily
increased their relative debt issuing activity during the l950s and 1960s,

but have just as steadily reduced it during the 1970s. Except only for 1975
and 1976, the federal government has reduced its debt ratio in every year
throughout the postwar period, although more slowly in years when recession
has temporarily inflated its deficit (and, again, depressed gross national

product in the denominator). These data on debt issuing activity by the

federal government are especially enlightening in the context of the recent
widespread expressions of concern over the magnitude and import of the federal

deficit. During the post World War II period, the federal debt ratio has in
fact declined not just from 63.0 in 1953 but from 103.5 in 1946. Moreover,
at 28.0 as of yearend 1978, the ratio of federal indebtedness to gross
national product stands once again at almost precisely its value in 1918.
At the same time, it is also true that the past half decade has marked a

departure from prior experience in an important way. The years 1975 and 1976
were the first in the postwar period in which the federal government's debt
ratio actually rose, and the renewed decline in 1977 and 1978 has not yet
reduced the ratio to its prerecession low.

Although the principal focus of this paper is on the post-Accord
experience shown in Figure 1, it is also useful to consider briefly the

history of the debt ratio in a longer time frame.3 Figure 2 shows the size
and composition of the U.S. nonfinancial debt ratio (with corporations and

unincorporated businesses aggregated) for 1918—78. Apart from a one-time
adjustment associated with the fall of prices after World War I, the U.S.
nonfinancial economy's reliance on debt relative to economic activity has

shown essentially no trend over these sixty years. At 143 as of yearend 1978,
the debt ratio was virtually unchanged from 142 in 1921. Nonfinancial
borrowers' outstanding debt rose significantly in relation to gross national
product only during the depression years 1930—33, when gross national product
itself not only was well below trend but also was falling too rapidly for the

pay—down of debt to keep pace.4 Otherwise the economy's total nonfinancial
debt ratio has remained roughly steady throughout this period, and the post—
Accord stability appears to be in large part a continuation of a pattern that
dates back at least to the l920s.

Comparison to Other Financial Ratios. Just how stable is the U.S.
economy's aggregate debt ratio? The question that immediately arises is,
stable in comparison to what? Given the traditional emphasis that economic
analysis has placed on the relationship between money and economic activity,
the usual money—income "velocities" provide a standard for comparison that
is sufficiently familiar to be a good place to begin.
Table 2 summarizes the stability of the ratios to gross national

product of ten financial aggregates by showing the coefficient of variation
(standard deviation normalized by mean) for each ratio computed from both

annual and quarterly U.S. data over the 1953-78 sample period (except for

the M3 money stock, for which data begin only in 1959). In each case the
table shows the coefficient of variation computed from raw data, and also
computed from detrended data. Among the debt measures included in Table 2,
"total net liabilities" is the total credit market indebtedness 'of non-

financial U.S. borrowers, as shown in column 1 of Table 1; "total liabilities"
is a broader measure that includes total net liabilities plus the credit
market indebtedness of U.S. financial institutions;5 "net non-federal
liabilities" is a narrower measure that only includes the net liabilities

of U.S. nonfinancial borrowers other than the federal government; net private
liabilities" is the analogous measure that excludes not only federal but also

state and local governments; and "bank credit" is the total of commercial

bank

loans and investments in the flow—of—funds accounts. Among the asset

measures, the monetary base (currency plus bank reserves adjusted for changes

in

reserve requirements), Ml (currency plus demand deposits), M2 (Ml plus

coinmerical bank time and saving deposits other than large negotiable

certificates), and M3 (M2 plus time and saving deposits at thrift institutions)

all follow standard definitions.6 "Net financial assets" is a generally

broader measure that includes total holdings of currency, deposits, and
credit market debt instruments by all U.S. nonfinancial holders (specifically,

five sectors broken out in Table 1); it is "net" in the analogous sense
that it excludes assets held by financial institutions, and therefore nets
the

out

financial intermediation.

For both annual and quarterly data, the coefficients of variation
reported in Table 2 show an immediate contrast between those financial
aggregates that exhibit time trends in their respective gross national

product "reciprocal valocities" — including the monetary base, the Ml money
stock, net non-federal liabilities, and net private liabilities — and those
that apparently have little or no trend. Judged on the basis of the
coefficients of variation computed from ratios of the raw data, the total
net liabilities measure (from the first column of Table 1) displays the
second steadiest relationship to gross national product out of the ten

aggregates included in Table 2. The only one that is superior is the
corresponding net aggregate on the asset side. None of the subtotals on
either the money or the credit side, including the much heralded M2 money
stock, exhibits the stability of the two economy—wide net totals.
The coefficients of variation computed from the detrended ratios are
more closely clustered, but again the net financial assets measure shows the

greatest stability, and total net liabilities follows closely behind. After
detrending, however, the total liabilities measure including the credit
market debt of intermediaries shows marginally more stability than the

corresponding net measure excluding them. Detrending improves the stability
of the ratios based on the other measures also, but in no case other than
the M3 money stock (for which the sample period is shorter) by enough even
to come close to the range of the three economy—wide aggregates. In light of

—10--

the increased attention recently paid by many economists to the monetary
base, it is interesting to note that the stability of the base ranks tenth
out of ten among the detrended series, in both the annual and the quarterly
data.

The Covariance of Public and Private Debt Ratios. An argument for
the stability of an aggregate inevitably relies on some notion of negative

covariance among that aggregate's components. In the case of the economy's
total nonfinancial debt ratio, as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, what makes
the stability of the ratio so interesting is in part the lack of stability
among the respective debt ratios of the several individual nonfinancial

sectors. Stability of the total debt ratio requires that movements in any
one sector's debt relative to economic activity typically be offset by
movements in the opposite direction in at least some other sector's debt.

Although casual inspection of Figure 1 and Table 1 suggests the appearance
of such a negative covariance relationship, the question is sufficiently
important to warrant more careful investigation.

A useful approach to analyzing interrelationships among economic time

series in this context is the vector autoregression.7 In brief, the vector
autoregression methodology first expresses each of a system of variables as
a function of lagged values of itself, lagged values of the other variables,
and a disturbance term; then solves this representation to express each

variable as a function of the entire history of the disturbances associated
with it and the other variables; and, finally, investigates the direction and
magnitude of the response of each variable to given independent shocks, or

"innovations," to any or all variables in the system. The vector autoregression is straightforward to estimate empirically, and simulation of the
solved-out system can then show whether innovations in particular variables

—11—

result in system—wide responses consistent with specific hypotheses under
investigation.

Although in principle it would be possible to apply this vector autoregression methodology to as full a disaggregation of the total nonfinancial

debt ratio as could be estimated with the available data — for example, the
five—sector breakdown used in Table 1 —

the

resulting profusion of partial

relationships would shed little light on the basic question of whether a
negative covariance between some nonfinancial sector's debt ratio and some

other's acts to preserve stability over time in the total. A simpler
approach, which not only renders the results more easily understandable but
also provides potentially useful insights for the discussion of behavioral
hypotheses in Sections II and III below, is to disaggregate only so far as
to distinguish the federal government's debt ratio and that of the private

nonfinancial

sector (here including state and local governments). The

resulting vector autoregression is

information that the vector autoregression system can provide, but it is

it is possible to identify as its driving force an independent innovation in

Table 3 presents simulation results based on the vector autoregression

L/Y remains unaffected contemporaneously, so that in the initial year the
economy's total nonfinancial debt ratio (LG + L)/Y also rises by 1%. Within
the next several years, however, a gradual decay in LC/Y and an offsetting

downward move in L/Y combine to eliminate virtually all of the initial bulge
in the total nonfinancial debt ratio caused by a positive shock to the

government component. This pattern appears to be consistent with an underlying model in which the innovation in the government debt ratio due to

deficit spending subsequently stimulates income, thereby lowering the private
debt ratio unless private borrowing increases in pace, but it may be consistent

with other models too. The important feature of these results here is simply
that they document a negative dynamic covariance in the two major components
of the economy's aggregate nonfinancial debt ratio.
The bottom half of Table 3 presents the results of analogous simulations

based on the alternative orthogonalization that extracts €2 as the independent

innovation in L/Y. In this case the positive innovation in L/Y exhibits
some momentum effect in the second year (although the relevant standard error
does not permit rejecting at any reasonable confidence level the null hypothesis

that the second—year L/Y value is 1.00 instead of 1.12), but thereafter the
decay is fairly rapid. Moreover, the offsetting negative movement in LG/Y
appears immediately (that is, immediately after the one-period delay imposed

by construction) and in substantial magnitude. Hence the total nonfinancial
debt ratio achieves its original value again fairly quickly after a shock to

private borrowing also. In sum, both sets of results presented in Table 3
document the existence of offsetting movements within the aggregate debt ratio
and hence both quantify and reinforce the casual impression of negative
covariance given by Figure 1 and Table 1.

Comparison of Nominal Income Regressions. Simple ratios of precisely
contemporaneous observations may well fail to capture the relevant concept of
"stability" in the relationship among variables that move over time with some

general lead or lag pattern between them. Table 4 presents summary statistics
for single equations, estimated using U.S. quarterly data for 1953-78 (except

for M3), relating the growth of nominal gross national product to a moving
average of the growth of each of the ten financial aggregates listed in Table

2, plus a moving average of a fiscal policy measure. The equations are

constrained to lie along fourth-degree polynomials with the implied

The implications of the results shown in Table 4 for the stability of
the different aggregates are, with few exceptions, roughly comparable to the

results of the simple ratio tests shown in Table 2. Net financial assets
again appears to have the most stable relation to gross national product,

with total liabilities, total net liabilities, and the M2 and M3 money stocks

ranking nearly as before.8 The most noticeable changes from the rankings
shown in Table 2 are the strong performance of the Ml money stock, which
ranks second on this criterion, and the poor performance of bank credit,

which here ranks last.
It would be interesting to know to what extent the rankings shown in

Table 4 represent a consistent stability or lack thereof over the entire
1953—78 sample, as opposed to one or more significant shifts in otherwise

fairly stable relationships. The Durbin—Watson statistic for bank credit,

for example —

the

measure ranking tenth — shows significant evidence of

positive serial correlation of the equation's residuals. Similarly, the

Durbin—Watson statistic for the monetary base —

the

measure ranking ninth —

shows possible evidence of serial correlation. A recent accumulation of
evidence has shown that the Federal Reserve System's change in 1970, to a

-16—

policy strategy placing greater emphasis on monetary aggregates, was more than

merely rhetorical as some critics have alleged.9 This change may well have

altered some of the relationships under consideration here. In addition, it
is possible that the Federal Reserve's removal of Regulation Q interest
ceilings from most large negotiable certificates of deposit in 1970 may also

have had an effect on some of these relationships.10 Hence 1970 is a
plausible time to expect a break on a priori grounds.
The first column of Table 5 presents F—statistics for a test of the
null hypothesis of no break at the beginning of 1970 in the regression

equations reported in Table 4. The only three measures for which it is not
possible to reject this null hypothesis at the .05 level are the two overall
net asset and liability totals (for which the margin of non—rejection is

minimal) and M3 (which has a much shorter pre-1970 sample period). For all
seven other measures the data provide significant evidence of a break at 1970.
The remaining columns of Table 5 present summary statistics for the

analogous regressions run over the shorter 1970—78 sample period. It is
interesting that the standard errors reported here are typically of about the

same magnitude as those shown in Table 4, but the fraction of the variation

of gross national product growth explained is much lower. These results
again confirm the strong stability of net financial assets and total liabilities,
and the only slightly less strong stability of the other credit measures (this

time including bank credit). On the money side, only the Ml money stock
performs comparably. For this short sample period the M2 money stock and the
monetary base rank respectively ninth and tenth among the ten measures examined.
In part because of the extent to which regressions of the form (7)

have been discredited by a variety of criticisms,U researchers examining the
money—income (or, here, debt—income) relationship have increasingly turned to

aggregates as in Tables 4 and 5, with eight quarters of lags on each variable

F and Y separately and then for the "reciprocal velocity" ratio F/y, which
would be analogous to the procedure followed in Table 3 since ln(F/Y) =

for convenience the table reports only the response of F/Y.

Moreover, instead of presenting the complete time path, the table presents
values only for the initial quarter and then for the final quarter in each
of the first five years.

ten financial aggregate ratios in response to a 1% innovation in the respective

aggregate. By construction, Y remains unaffected contemporaneously, so that
in the initial quarter each F/Y ratio also rises by 1%. After several quarters,
however, the bulge disappears from most of the ratios as Y rises or F declines,

or both. In the absence of a largely arbitrary judgment of the exact time
horizon that is relevant to the analysis, it is impossible to interpret these
results in other than a descriptive way. Even so, 'the comparisons are quite

suggestive. Among the five asset ratios, those for the Ml and M2 money stocks
and for the net asset total all decline rapidly albeit irregularly, while the
ratio for the M3 rrcney stock continues to rise through the first year before

then declining. The monetary base ratio over-corrects (although not significantly so at usual confidence levels) and then remains persistently negative.
In sum, except perhaps for the over-correction of the monetary base ratio,

there is little to distinguish the respective simulation patterns shown by
these five financial asset ratios.

The same is not true for the five debt ratios, however. Here only

the total net liabilities ratio — again, the series documented in Table 1

and Figure 1 — and the bank credit ratio (though to a lesser extent) return
rapidly and monotonically to their initial values after a shock to the

relevant aggregate. What is especially interesting in these results is the
contrast between the performance of the ratio for total net liabilities and
the ratios for net non—federal liabilities and net private liabilities (both
of which are just components of total net liabilities) as well as the total
liabilities measure consisting of total net liabilities plus the liabilities

of financial intermediaries. Both the net private liabilities ratio and the
slightly broader net non-federal liabilities ratio continue to move further
away from their initial values for two years in response to an innovation in

—19—

the relevant aggregate, and neither shows any significant return to its

initial value within five years —

hardly

a demonstration of "stability."

Once net federal liabilities are included as well, however, the total net
liabilities ratio exhibits just as much stability in this context as does any

of the five asset ratios. Moreover, proceeding to broaden the liability
measure further by including intermediaries' debt only results in lessened
apparent stability.
Among the various liability measures considered, therefore,

these results suggest that there is indeed something unique about total net
(that is, nonfinancial sector) liabilities. It is as if the Ml money stock
ratio were sharply unstable, but adding commercial bank time and saving
deposits to form the M2 money stock ratio yielded stability, and further
adding thrift institution deposits to form the 143 money stock ratio destroyed

that stability — none of which appears to happen. Hence not only does the
total net liabilities ratio exhibit just as much stability as any of the five
asset ratios in these vector autoregression tests, it does so uniquely among
the various debt aggregates tested.
The lower half of Table 6 presents the results of analogous simulations
based on the alternative orthogonalizaiton of (9) that extracts c2 as the

independent innovation in Y. In this case, by construction, it is F that
remains unaffected contemporaneously, so that in the initial quarter a 1%

innovation in Y generates a 1% decline in Fly. Subsequently, however, F/Y
rises as the innovation in Y decays or F rises, or both. The paths traced by
the ten asset or liability ratios are sufficiently similar, however, that

there appears to be little ground for distinguishing among them here.

Evidence from More Complete Vector Autoregression Systems. One
element in the tendency of recent research to eschew reliance on simple

nominal income regressions of the form (7) has been an increasing reluctance

—20—

to focus on the relationship between money (or, here, debt) and nominal
income without distinguishing between the real and price components in nominal

income variation. Table 7 presents simulation results that are analogous to
those shown in Table 6 but based on the trivariate system

where P is the gross national product price deflator (1972=100), X is real

in (8) and (9). Like Table 6, Table 7 again shows simulation results only
for the various asset or liability ratios, in each case solved simply as

ln[F/(X.P)] =

The estimation and sample period are again

the same as for (8).

The three panels of Table 7 successively present results for the
simulation of (ii) orthogonalized to extract

as the independent innovation

in F, to extract C2 as the independent innovation in X, and to extract C3 as

the independent innovation in P. The responses of the asset or liability
ratios to an innovation in the relevant aggregate, shown in panel A, resemble

those shown in Table 6 for the analogous bivariate system. Considering the
roles of real income and prices separately does little to alter the earlier
impression of stability of the ratios for most of the asset aggregates and for

instability of the ratios for liabilities measures that are components of the

total net liabilities aggregate. The responses to an innovation in real income,
shown in panel B, also largely resemble the responses shown in Table 6 resulting

from an innovation in nominal income. Again there is little to distinguish
the stability of one ratio from that of another in this context. The responses
to an innovation in prices, shown in panel C, bear some resemblence (with
appropriate sign changes) to the responses to innovations in the respective

aggregates from panel A, although some interesting differences emerge. Once
again the total net liabilities ratio appears to be quite stable despite

strong instability in its two components. In addition, the net financial
assets and monetary base ratios again appear stable, although with somewhat

more (temporary) over—correction than before in the latter. The notable
contrasts to the panel A results are the appearance of greater stability in
the ratio for the M3 money stock and less stability in the ratios for the Ml
money stock and for bank credit.
Finally, Table 8 presents simulation results for a four—variable

system including the Ml money stock, total net liabilities (LF), real
income and prices, estimated and solved analogously to (10) and (11) for the

vector [in Mt in

in X, in P1'. The four panels of the table show

simulation results for the system orthogonalized successively to extract the

system,

together with the "reciprocal velocity" ratios for the money and debt

variables.

mostly temporary positive response in the first year only, real income is
sharply higher in the first year but lower thereafter, and prices rise to a

new higher level within three years. The money ratio therefore at first over—
corrects (because of the strong real income response) and then stabilizes

with some small (and insignificant) oscillations. The debt ratio first
declines sharply but then returns essentially to its initial value. Here the

money and debt ratios appear to be of comparable stability. In response to
an analogous innovation in nonfinancial debt (panel B), the debt variable
remains enlarged throughout the five years, both the money stock and prices
are temporarily higher, and real income, after a small dip in the first year,

is irregularly higher throughout. The debt ratio therefore continues to
rise through the first year, but then declines fairly regularly toward its

initial value. The money ratio is first higher, and then persistently lower.
Here the debt ratio appears to be, if anything, more stable than the money

ratio. Finally, the responses to innovations in real income (panel C) and in
prices (panel D) provide little basis for judging the relative stability of the
money and debt ratios.

Overview. What conclusion does this battery of descriptive statistics
and assorted tests suggest for the stability of the relationship between the
U.S. economyts total nonfinancial indebtedness and its underlying nonfinancial

activity? At the very least, this collection of results indicates that the
stability of this relationship is just as strong as the stability of comparable

but more familiar relationships involving various definitions of the money

stock or the monetary base. Beyond that, the data repeatedly suggest that
the relationship for the total nonfinancial debt measure is more stable than
that for any of its underlying components.

—23—

II. Three Possible Explanations of the Stability of the Debt Ratio
Some

Familiar

Basics. A fairly standard element of many simple models

of economic steady states is a fixed proportional relationship between the

flow of income and the stock of wealth.13 Moreover, under assumptions
involving such matters as the production process and the population age
structure, a fixed proportional wealth—to—income relation may also be charac-

teristic of models of steady—state growth)4 In either case the rationale
stems from the familiar view that the chief motive for holding wealth is to
derive the stream of services (broadly defined) that flow from various forms
of wealth, and that the demand for such services by individual maximizers is
(like the demand for nondurable consumption) proportional to income.

In the absence of claims issued by either the government or private

participants in the economy, the "wealth" that is (or may be) proportional to

income in such models consists entirely of tangible assets. In the presence
of financial claims, however, the wealth concept that is most plausible to
relate to income flows in this manner is presumably net worth, and exactly

how to define net worth becomes a potentially important issue. In a basic
model with financial claims but no financial intermediaries, the net worth
relation is either again simply

NW

TA

(12)

if the private sector "sees through the shell" of government and treats the
government's liabilities as if they were its own, or else

NW =

TA+LG

(13)

where NW is net worth, TA is tangible assets, and LG is again the government's

liabilities. An alternative way of stating (13), when the government's
holdings of financial assets are approximately zero, is

NW =

TA+FA-L

(14)

—24—

where FA is total financial asset holdings and

is again the private sector's

financial liabilities. Since all financial claims must be held,15
LG +

L=

FA.

(15)

Finally, an alternative form of (15) that is relevant in the presence of
financial intermediaries is

LG +LP +LI =

P

FA

+FAI

(16)

where FA now distinguishes financial assets held by the private nonfinancial
sector, and L' and FA' are respectively the liabilities owed and assets held

by intermediaries.'6 Nothing in (12)-(16) changes if all variables are
measured as ratios to income

a convention that is to be understood whenever

it is relevant in what follows.
In terms of these relationships, the basic phenomenon documented in

Section I is the strong stability of the sum L + LG (again, as ratios to
gross national product) for the U.S. economy. The stability of this stock—
flow relationship raises issues that are in part reminiscent of those involved
in the flow-flow relationship associated primarily with Denison [41 and

subsequently studied by others. In addition, as was noted at the outset, its
stability in comparison with financial measures more commonly used as a basis
for monetary policy discussions raises issues about the use of the money

stock (however defined) as the intermediate target variable, or more generally
as the most important information variable, for the conduct of monetary

policy.17 Even as a matter of purely basic research into economic behavior,
however, the results assembled in Section I naturally lead to the question of

why — in the scientific sense meaning "how" — the

economy's total non-

financial debt ratio turns out to be so stable.

An Ultraratioriality Hypothesis. In their analysis of the stability of
U.S. gross private saving in relation to gross national product typically

—25—

known as "Denison's Law," David and Scadding [2] introduced an hypothesis of
"ultrarationality" which, after appropriate transformation from a flow—flow
context to a stock—flow context, also represents a possible explanation for
the stability of U.S. nonfinancial indebtedness in relation to gross national

product. Specifically, David and Scadding argued that individuals "see
through the shell" of both government and the corporation, so that personal
saving and corporate saving are close substitutes, as are personal consumption

and taxes. Hence, as Denison had noted earlier, total gross private saving
(the sum of personal saving plus corporate saving plus capital consumption)

not only is more stable than its individual components but also is apparently

unaffected by variations in the share of income absorbed by the government

sector. Moreover, David and Scadding concluded that the apparent invariance
of the gross private saving rate with respect to variations in the surplus or
deficit position of the government sector, also noted by Denison, implies a
close substitutability of private debt and public debt in private portfolios.
This same concept of "seeing through the shell" represented by

government and corporations also constitutes one possible explanation for the

stability of the economy's total nonfinancial debt ratio. If the private
sector regards the debt of government as equivalent to its own debt, then its

net worth statement in the form (14) should instead be

NW =

TA+FA_(I?+LG)

(14')

or, given (15), simply (12) again. Moreover, if households regard the debt
of corporations as equivalent to their own debt, then they will not

distinguish between direct and corporate liabilities within LiD. Under this
hypothesis, then, households would have viewed the decline of LG (here
including both federal and state-local obligations) from 72.7% of the gross
national product in 1953 to only 40.6% in 1978 as a decline in their own

-26—

indebtedness, which they then slightly more than made up by increasing their
direct indebtedness (including obligations of unincorporated businesses) from
36.8% to 64.8% and by having corporations increase the indirect component of

L from 25.1% to 37.8%.
The essential point in this perspective is the existence of a stable
ratio to income not just for some undefined "wealth" concept, as is usually
assumed, or even for the more precise concept of net worth, but, in addition,
for the total assets and total liabilities components of net worth separately.18
Following the "services flow" rationale noted above, the main idea here is
that assets and liabilities each separately yield streams of services
(presumably negative for the liabilities), and that individual maximizers will

seek a quantity of each that is proportional to income. Hence, given any
variation in the government share of the overall liabilities total, for whatever purposes indicated by public policy objectives, the private sector
consisting of households and the corporations that the households own will

simply adjust by issuing enough debt to offset the government's action. Yet
a further elaboration of the same basic idea that changes nothing fundamental

would be to view corporations as also responding to independent objectives or
influences (for example, tax laws), and households as then adjusting their
debt positions to offset the given actions of both the government and the

corporations. In either case, the nonfinancial economy will seek (and achieve)
a, stable ratio of its aggregate liabilities to income regardless of the

composition of that aggregate.
The "ultrarationality" hypothesis is interesting for a number of

reasons. From a purely behavioral standpoint, for example, it carries strong
implications about individuals' perceptions and about the motivating forces

underlying

familiar aspects of portfolio behavior. Moreover, as David and

—27—

Scadding pointed out, it also implies that "ex ante crowding out" renders
fiscal policy impotent in both the short and long run.

A Capital Leveraging Hypothesis. In addition to the extreme view
that it embodies of individuals' ability to "see through the shell" of both
government and corporations, the ultrarationality hypothesis described above

rests importantly on two strong assumptions. First, it relies on the
presumption of a general absence of effective credit market constraints.
People are implicitly assumed not only to want to substitute their own (and
their corporations') indebtedness for government debt but also to be able to

do so. Second, it assumes not only that people want to hold their net worth,
total assets and total liabilities stable in relation to income but also,
because financial liabilities owed equal financial assets held, that they
hold their tangible assets and financial assets separately in stable
respective relations to income.
An alternative route to explaining the observed stability of the U.S.
economy's nonfinancial debt ratio is to abandon these two assumptions, as
well as that of "seeing through the shell," and instead to assume, first,
that the private sector does face credit market constraints and, second, that

it does not necessarily hold its asset ratio stable. If the private sector does
not view government debt as equivalent to its own, then it is clear from (13)

that, if LG declines (as has happened in the United States during the 1953—78
sample period examined in Section I), either NW must also decline or TA must

rise, or both. If the more standard assumption of a stable ratio of net
worth to income is approximately correct, then under this alternative view
the counterpart to the relative decline in government liabilities documented
in Table 1 and Figure 1 would have been a relative rise in the private sector's

holdings of tangible assets — presumably including not only corporate assets

—28—

in the form of productive plant and equipment but also private holdings of

residential real estate and consumer durables. Moreover, it is clear from
(14) that, if TA rises while NW remains unchanged, then either FA must decline

or L must also rise.
The potential importance of credit market constraints under this view

is most readily apparent in the household sector's debt arrangements. In
fact, borrowing against tangible assets in the form of home mortgage and
consumer installment credit has constituted the overwhelming majority of the

household sector's credit market indebtedness at least since World War II
(89% as of yearend 1978). Similarly, the borrowing of many corporations
consists primarily of explicitly secured long-term market debt, in the form
of mortgages or "first mortgage" bonds, and implicitly secured short—term
bank debt matched by inventory holdings.

Under the "capital leveraging" hypothesis to explain the stability of
the total nonfinancial debt ratio, credit market constraints effectively

prohibit the private sector from freely substituting its own liabilities in

place of the government's declining liabilities. Instead, the private sector
can increase its own liabilities only to the extent that it is also accumu-

lating more tangible assets with which to back them. The stability of the
U.S. nonfinancial debt ratio therefore reflects in the first instance an
increase in tangible assets in approximately the proportion necessary to hold
net worth fixed in relation to income as ownership of government liabilities

declines relative to income. By shifting outward the effective credit market
constraints, this relative increase in tangible assets then facilitates the

increase in private financial liabilities. From (14) once again, if private
liabilities increase fully in step with tangible asset holdings, then not
only net worth but also private financial asset holdings will remain stable

—29—

in

relation to income.

This capital leveraging hypothesis also bears a number of interesting
implications that extend beyond questions of portfolio behavior and the
importance of borrowing constraints per se. Like the tiultrarationalityll

hypothesis, for example, it implies that the government deficit is a major

determinant of the economy's physical investment. Unlike that hypothesis,
however, it does not require that consumption move to offset tax payments.
Hence fiscal policy can affect not just the composition of income but also
its total.

An Asset Demand Hypothesis. Finally, a third approach to explaining
the debt stability phenomenon combines some elements of both of the two
hypotheses developed above.
According to the ultrarationality hypothesis, the private sector not
only acts so as to maintain a stable ratio of net worth to income but also
maintains separately stable ratios for both total assets and total liabilities.
A variant of that hypothesis would be to assume in addition the existence of

behavior enforcing stable ratios to income not just for total assets but, in

addition, for the specific components of that asset total —

tangible

and

financial. In other words, the streams of services yielded by tangible and
financial assets are sufficiently weak substitutes that individual maximizers

exhibit

people

stable demands for each separately in proportion to income. If

seek

to maintain a stable relationship between financial asset holdings

and income, then the market-clearing constraint (15) immediately indicates
that any relative decline in the given supply of the government's liabilities

will be matched by an increase in the demand for private liabilities. If
this demand is insensitive to such factors as yield (which is what a stable
ratio implies in this context), then a yield-sensitive supply of private

—30—

liabilities will adjust so as to clear the market for financial claims at a
quantity that represents a stable ratio to income for total financial assets
held, and a ratio for private liabilities owed that rises so as to offset the
decline in government liabilities.

An alternative route to the same result is to combine with the capital
leveraging hypothesis the assumption of a stable demand for financial assets.
As the discussion above has already noted, it is clear from (14) that, if NW
is stable and TA rising (to offset the decline in LG), then either FA must
decline or

must rise (or both). If, in addition, the demand for financial

assets bears a stable relation to income, then necessarily private liabilities
will rise.

In either case —

that

is, under ultrarationality with a stable ratio

of tangible assets to income, or under capital leveraging with a rising

tangible asset ratio —

the

distinguishing characteristic of the "asset demand"

hypothesis is the assumption of a stable, interest insensitive demand for

financial assets in relation to income. The supply of private liabilities
then adjusts, either just to clear the financial claims market or, alternatively, to facilitate the holding of more tangible assets while holding no

less financial assets. Either way, a decline in government liabilities leads
to a rise in private liabilities.

III. Some Evidence from Household and Corporate Sector Balance Sheets

The U.S. Aggregate Net Balance Sheet. As of yearend 1978 the consolidated balance sheet of the private domestic U.S. economy showed a combined
net worth of $7.3 trillion, consisting of $5.1 trillion of reproducible
tangible assets (valued at reproduction cost),19 $1.5 trillion of land (at

market value), $535 billion of net claims against the federal government
(excluding Social Security claims), $100 billion of net claims against state
and local governments, and $106 billion of SDRs, gold (valued at the official

price) and net claims against foreigners. The largest two holders of these
assets were households ($3.8 trillion, net of pension reserves and equity
claims on corporations and unincorporated businesses) and nonfinancial non—
farm corporations ($1.6 trillion).20
In order to avoid missing phenomena that may be lost in aggregation,

in examining the data to look for patterns that may shed light one way or the
other on the hypotheses outlined in Section II it is useful to focus at first
on the holdings of specific sectors rather than on fully consolidated totals.

Since households and nonfInancial corporations not only hold the great
majority of the economy's net worth but also account for most of the non—
federal liabilities shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, the object of this section
is to seek some perspective on the alternative hypotheses suggested in Section
II by examining movements in the balance sheets of these two sectors during
the post World War II period.

Households. Figure 3 plots the four chief components of the household
sector's balance sheet (with equity claims and pension reserves not netted
out) grouped as in (14), measured again as ratios of yearend stocks to

seasonally adjusted fourth—quarter gross national product. On balance the

net worth ratio — assumed to be steady in all three of the hypotheses
advanced in Section II —

exhibited

substantial variation but little overall

trend through the early 1970s, first rising in the 1950s and then declining

in the 1960s. The continuation of the decline into the 1970s, however, has
resulted in a slight downward trend for the postwar period as a whole.

Within the net worth total, tangible asset holdings have risen irregularly
throughout this period, while the much larger financial asset holdings
(dominated by equity claims) have shown the rising and then falling pattern

also exhibited by net worth. As is already familiar from Table 1 and Figure 1,
households' liabilities have risen throughout, although the pace of the
increase was significantly slower during 1964—75 than either before or since.21

Although the large variation in the value of households' financial
asset holdings due to equity price movements makes it difficult to generalize

from these data, it does not appear that households have held their balance

sheet proportions fixed — as the asset demand hypothesis put forth in Section
II would imply

over this period. This variation is even more apparent in

Figure 4, which shows the almost continuously rising ratio of households'

total assets (tangible plus financial) to their net worth. Moreover, Figure
5 shows that the ratio of households' liabilities to their tangible assets —

which the capital leveraging hypothesis put forth in Section II suggests
should be stable — also rose steadily until the early 1960s, although on
balance it has displayed little trend movement subsequently. Finally,
Figure 6 plots net worth and financial asset ratios for the household sector
that are analogous to those in Figure 3 but with equity claims and pension

reserves subtracted out. Here it is clear that, apart from changes in equity
holdings and pension reserves, the 1965—78 decline in financial asset holdings
relative to gross national product has been insufficient to offset the 1953—64

rise. Hence on this netted basis households have actually been increasing
their financial asset holdings just as they have been increasing their
tangible asset holdings, so that the ratio of their net worth to gross
national product has on balance shown a very slight increase over the entire

1953-78 period

in contrast to the decline shown in Figure 3.

Simple inspection of these data for households alone yields conclusions
that are, on the whole, unsympathetic to all three hypotheses suggested in

Section II. Household net worth, including equity claims valued at market,
has not been steady but has declined in relation to income; netting out
claims against the government, as under the ultrarationality hypothesis,

would only make it show an even greater decline. Similarly, although household net worth with equity claims subtracted out has shown a very slight
upward trend, netting out claims against the government would still change

that to a pronounced downward trend. In addition, households have not
increased their outstanding indebtedness only in pace with their tangible
asset holdings, as would be the case under the capital leveraging hypothesis.

Instead, households have steadily borrowed more against these assets, thereby

substantially increasing their overall leverage. Finally, the ratio of
financial assets to income has not remained fixed either, as would be the
case under the asset demand hypothesis.

Nevertheless, a more careful examination of these data using vector
autoregression methods does suggest a response of households' liability
behavior to government borrowing, as is consistent with all three hypotheses
from Section II, as well as at least some response of households' tangible
asset holdings as would be implied by the capital leveraging hypothesis.

Table 9 presents simulation results for a three—variable vector autoregression
system including the ratios to gross national product of federal government

liabilities, household tangible assets (TAH) and household liabil3.ties (L'),

estimated using annual data and solved analogously to (10) and (11) for the

vector [ln(LG/Y), ln(TA'/Y)t, ln(LH/Y)t]1, and orthogonalized to extract
the independent innovation in LG/Y. Beginning in the second year, the household tangible assets ratio declines sharply in response to an innovation in

the government debt ratio. In addition, after a somewhat puzzling delay of
four years, the household debt ratio declines as well. While the tangible
assets ratio eventually returns to (actually above, though not significantly

so) its original value, as is consistent with proportional demands for the
stream of housing and other durable goods services in relation to income,

the debt ratio remains depressed through the tenth year. Although the
specific magnitudes and time patterns of these responses clearly require
further explanation, and further investigation using the underlying variables

rather than just ratios is necessary to distinguish portfolio responses from
income responses, these results do suggest at least some role for households'

behavior in accounting for the observed stability of the U.S. aggregate nonfinancial debt ratio in ways consistent with the ideas advanced in Section II.

Nonfinancial Corporations. Figure 7 plots ratios for the same four
components shown in Figure 3, from the aggregate balance sheet of nonfarrn

nonfinancial business corporations. These data appear, if anything, even
more puzzling from the perspective of the hypotheses advanced in Section II.
The ratio of corporate net worth to income has moved more in step with than
against the household net worth ratio, so that there has been no observable
tendency for variations of the two to offset one another as the ultraration—

ality hypothesis might suggest. Corporate tangible asset holdings relative
to gross national product have shown an upward trend overall, as would be
the case under the capital leveraging hypothesis, but with a steep decline

in the late 1950s and early 1960s.22 Corporate financial asset holdings
relative to gross national product rose irregularly through 1973 and have
subsequently declined, rather than remaining steady as the asset demand

hypothesis would require. Finally, corporate liabilities have followed much
the same pattern as corporate financial assets, although with more amplitude

and somewhat more smoothness.23 As Figures 8 and 9 show, corporations have,
like households, increased their overall leverage either by borrowing more
against their physical assets or by borrowing against their holdings of
financial as well as physical assets.
Once again, however, closer inspection of these data using vector
autoregression methods suggests conclusions more sympathetic to the hypotheses

in Section II, and in particular to the capital leveraging hypothesis. Table
10 presents simulation results analogous to those in Table 9, for a three—
variable vector autoregression system including the ratios to gross national
product of federal government liabilities, corporate tangible assets (TAC)

and corporate liabilities (LC), estimated using annual data and solved

analogously to (10) and (11) for the vector [1n(LG/Y), 1n(TA1/Y), ln(LC/Y)jI,
and orthogonalized to extract the independent innovation in LG/Y. Here the
innovation in the government debt ratio immediately results in a large decline
in the corporate tangible assets ratio as well as the corporate debt ratio.

The effect of the original innovation on all three variables in the system

essentially disappears by the fourth year. Even more so than the results for
the household sector shown in Table 9, these response patterns appear approx-

imately consistent with what the hypotheses of Section II — and especially

the capital leveraging hypothesis — would lead one to expect.

IV. Concluding Comments
The analysis in this paper suggests several conclusions.

First, results based on a variety of methodological approaches —

ranging

from simple inspection of ratios, to nominal income regressions, to

bivariate and more complex vector autoregression systems — consistently
indicate that the aggregate debt of all nonfinancial borrowers in the United
States bears as close a relationship to U.S. nonfinancial economic activity
as do the more familiar asset aggregates like the money stock (however

measured) or the monetary base. In contrast to the asset aggregates, however,
which exhibit little overall difference among themselves in this context,
total nonfinancial indebtedness appears to be unique among liability aggregates

in the stability of this relationship. Moreover, the data show evidence of
a negative covariance between the public and private components of total
nonfinancial indebtedness, thereby further substantiating the case for
stability in the aggregate.
Second, three hypotheses (that is, at least three) provide internally

consistent potential explanations for this phenomenon an "ultrarationality"
hypothesis which emphasizes acute perceptions and offsetting actions on the
part of the private sector, a "capital leveraging" hypothesis which emphasizes
credit market constraints, and an "asset demand" hypothesis which emphasizes
market clearing and the private sector's role as a net lender.
Third, initial efforts to match these three hypotheses against the
data for the household and corporate business sectors yield mixed results.
Simple inspection of the data leads to impressions largely inconsistent with
any of the three, but the results of vector autoregression experiments are
more supportive, especially of the "capital leveraging" hypothesis.

—37—

It is important to re—emphasize, however, that — as was noted at

the outset — these simple experiments stop well short of rigorously
formulating and testing any of the three hypotheses at hand. One immediate
reason for caution, of course, is merely the usual important distinction
between descriptive statistics and test statistics, but other problems are

present too. Although the basic phenomenon documented in the first part of
this paper concerns the joint behavior of all nonfinancial borrowers in the
economy, the "tests" assembled in the latter part focus separately on

household and corporate behavior patterns. The relevant concept of nonfinancial economic activity for this purpose is problematical as well.

Nominal gross national product is not necessarily the best measure even for
aggregate-level investigations, despite its conventional acceptance in
analogous contexts, and it is even more questionable for issues focused

specifically on household or corporate sector activity. Allowing in some
way a role for equity claims, along with the debt claims, would broaden but
no doubt also further complicate the analysis.
Nevertheless, even on the basis of the results reported in this
paper, the case for some redirection of "monetary" economics research toward
the nonbank public's liabilities as well as its assets appears warranted.

This

paper is a part of the National Bureau of Economic Research project
on "The Changing Roles of Debt and Equity in Financing U.S. Capital Forma—
tion", sponsored by the lunerican Council of Life Insurance. I am grateful
to Angelo Melino and Chris Piros for research assistance; to them as well
as Richard Davis, James Duesenberry, Michael Hamburger, John Scadding,
Christopher Sims and Stephen Taylor for helpful discussions; and to the
National Bureau and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for research support.

1. Among models familiar in the current literature, that of Brunner and
Meltzer [1] — in which money and credit are both determined as the
product of their respective endogenous "multipliers" and the exogenous
probably comes closest to representing this view. Even
monetary base
so, Brunner and Meltzer have stopped well short of denying any significance to the money and credit totals thus determined.
2. In part because of the capital export controls that were in force during
1964—74, foreign obligors accounted for only a small fraction of
borrowing in the U.S. markets throughout this period.
3. See Friedman [8] for a discussion of the postwar versus prewar periods.
Figure 2 below is from [8].

4. The debt ratio peak during 1918-78 occurred in 1933, the trough year
of the depression. In addition, much of the household and business debt
nominally outstanding during the depression was of questionable value.

5. The difference between the two is small, consistingforthemost part of

and mortgage pools. Most liabilities of financial intermediaries (for
example, deposits and life insurance and pension reserves) are not
classified as credit market liabilities in the Federal Reserve's flow—
of—funds accounts.

6. Because these four series are measured weekly or monthly, rather than at
the end of each quarter, it is necessary to determine how to construct
the ratios. The quarterly data use quarterly averages in the numerator.
The annual data use December averages in the numerator because this
method made the respective coefficients of variation smaller in every
case except the detrended M2 ratio; in that one case the value computed
using the quarterly average in the numerator is .027.

7. See Sims [15] for a discussion of the methodology and rationale underlying
the vector autoregression approach.
8. The effect of the shortened sample period for M3 is immediately apparent
from the contrast between the small standard error and the large (but
large) R2.

not all that

9. For leading examples of this evidence, see De Rosa and Stern [3],
Diggins [5], Feige and McGee [6], and Lombra and Moran [11].
10. Lindsey [10] has argued along these lines for the case of bank credit.
11. See,for example, Colcifeld and Blinder [9], Sargent [14], and Modigliafli
and Ando [13].

12. The use of levels of logarithms in (8) instead of differences of
logarithms as in (7) has essentially no effect as long as the lag
lengths of the Bjj are sufficient to provide roots near the unit circle.
(If no roots near the unit circle are needed, then the differencing in
(7) is incorrect in the first place.)
13. See, for example, Tobin and Buiter [16].
14. See, for example, Modigliani [12].
15. Some analyses distinguish between outside money and government debt, so
that (15) need not hold if the outside money is excluded from LG. The
data for LG used in this paper exclude currency but include the Federal
Reserve System's holdings of other government debt, so that only the
difference between the two would be at issue here. As of yearend 1978
currency outside banks was $99.1 billion and member banks' reserves
were $46.7 billion, against $118.6 billion of Federal Reserve holdings
of U.S. Government securities.
16. Just as (14) ignores the government's holdings of financial assets, (16)
ignores the equity (capital) position of intermediaries.

17. See Friedman [7] for an analysis distinguishing intermediate target
variables and information variables.
18. Alternatively, one could express the same concept as a stable ratio of
net worth to income plus a stable leverage ratio — defined, for
example, as the ratio of total assets to net worth.
19. The composition of the tangible assets included $1.9 trillion of
residential structures, $1.8 trillion of nonresidential plant and
equipment, $793 billion of business inventories, and $574 billion of
consumer durables.
20. The other holdings by sector were $805 billion for unincorporated non—
farm businesses, $629 billion for farms, and $490 billion for private
financial institutions (net of corporate equity claims, but including
pension reserves credited to households). These figures, as well as
the sector detail used throughout this section, are from unpublished
Federal Reserve Board data.

21. In contrast to the data in Table 1 and Figure 1, which include only
credit market liabilities, the data shown here include all liabilities.
Most household liabilities are in fact credit market liabilities; the
difference, consisting of security credit, trade credit, and deferred
or unpaid life insurance premiums, was less than 4% of total liabilities
as of yearend 1978.
22. It would be useful in future research to divide the sharp post-1972
rise into quantity versus relative price components.

23. The liabilities data in Figure 7 also differ from those in Figure 1 and
Table 1 by including all liabilities.
(See again footnote 21.) Of the
$l.179 trillion of nonfarm nonfinancial corporations' liabilities
outstanding as of yearend 1978, only $835 billion (just over 70%) were
credit market liabilities; the remainder included $282 billion of trade
debt, $22 billion of unpaid profit taxes, and $39 billion of other
miscellaneous liabilities.
