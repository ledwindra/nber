The Discount Rate for Public Policy over the Distant Future

ABSTRACT
The choice of discount rate has a significant impact on net benefit estimates when costs today
have benefits over long time horizons. Standard U.S. government practice for cost–benefit
analysis is to bound such analysis using two alternative rates. These rates are meant to represent
the rate of return paid by capital investment and the rate received by consumers. Previous work
has shown this approach legitimately bounds the analysis—but only when future benefits accrue
directly to consumers either in a two-period model or as a perpetuity. We generalize to consider
arbitrary patterns of future benefits, accruing either directly to consumers or indirectly through
future investment. We derive an expression for the appropriate discount rate and show that it
converges to the consumption rate for benefits increasingly far into the future. More generally,
the bounding rates depend on the temporal pattern of the undiscounted dollars. As an application,
we estimate the appropriate discount rate for climate change damages from carbon dioxide,
finding it lies in a narrow range (+/- 0.5 percent) around the consumer rate of interest.

Introduction
Conducting cost–benefit analysis (CBA) for government policy requires a

discount rate to compare costs and benefits over time in order to establish, on net,
whether total benefits exceed total costs. For more than 15 years, federal
guidelines for government CBA in the United States have indicated that two
discount rates should be used, 7 and 3 percent (OMB 2003). When applied to
government policies with costs today and benefits extending far into the future—
our stylized arrangement throughout this paper1—the different outcomes
associated with these rates can be striking. Recent government estimates of
climate change benefits, for example, are six to nine times higher using 3 percent
rather than 7 percent.2
The explicit rationale for this range of rates is based on whether the costs
of regulation today fall primarily on the allocation of private capital or instead
directly affect household consumption. These rates reflect the pretax return paid
by private capital and the return received by consumers, respectively, with the

While costs and benefits could occur in any period, we have in mind problems where costs today
are being measured against benefits in future periods. Most public policy problems break down
this way, as investments are made today that then yield benefits. Even when there may be
operating costs in the future, these can be subtracted from the future benefit flows. In this paper,
the undiscounted costs and benefits dollars are assume to be measured in their certainty
equivalents.

difference owing largely to taxes.3 For shorthand and consistency, we refer to
these two rates as the “investment rate” and “consumer rate.” Ignoring risk and
uncertainty, CBA using these rates provides upper and lower bounds on the
estimate of net benefits when benefits directly to consumers under two alternative,
specific assumptions: either the economy exists in only two periods (Harberger
1972; Sandmo and Drèze 1971) or the pattern of benefits over time is a perpetuity
(Marglin 1963a, 1963b; Drèze 1974; Sjaastad and Wisecarver 1977).
The main point of this paper is to derive more general bounds on the
discount rate in a multi-period model when benefits are no longer assumed to
accrue directly to consumers or to be a perpetuity. In particular, we show that
these bounds converge to the consumer interest rate when valuing benefits far into
the future. Intuitively, the appropriate discount rate is exactly the consumption
rate when all costs and benefits accrue to consumption. Impacts on investment
either (1) have to be converted to consumption equivalents using a shadow price
or, equivalently, (2) must be accommodated by a different discount rate.
However, the effect of shadow pricing is at most a bounded multiplicative factor.
Mechanically, the appropriate discount rate under approach (2) can be defined as
an upward or downward adjustment to the consumption rate based on this
bounded multiplicative factor. Looking far into the future, smaller and smaller

3

While OMB guidance clearly articulates the notion that 7 and 3 percent represent investment and
consumption rates, there are several reasons to believe taxes do not entirely explain the difference.
Corporate and individual marginal tax rates, perhaps averaging 40 percent each over the past few
decades, do not produce such a large divergence. Moreover, not all capital is subject to corporate
taxes and consumers can reduce their effective tax rate through tax-deffered savings (for
retirement and education). More likely, some of this difference should be ascribed to risk.

2

adjustments to the consumer rate will be needed to compensate for that factor.
More generally, this range depends on the pattern of future benefits over time and
the shadow price of capital.
We can use the U.S. government’s values of 7 and 3 percent for the
investment and consumption rates to provide numeric examples.4 Applied to the
pattern of climate mitigation benefits arising in a recent National Academy of
Science report (NAS 2017), the appropriate range is quite narrow. The estimated
discount rate would be between 2.3 and 4.0 percent if we use the government
rates to derive a bound on the shadow price. Adding additional assumptions based
on a Ramsey growth model, we can derive a particular shadow price of capital
and an even narrower range of 2.6–3.4 percent for the discount rate. On the other
hand, the discount rate for a policy with benefits entirely in the very near term
could vary from -50 to +50 percent depending on the distribution of impacts on
capital versus consumption goods.
At a practical level, our results provide an argument for focusing the
discussion of the social discount rate5 on an interval centered on the consumer
discount rate and based on each application’s particular pattern of benefits,
particularly over long horizons. This need not require any more information than
the current government CBA, with selected investment and consumer rates
implying a bound on the shadow price.

4

As noted in footnote 3, we cannot explain the difference between 7 and 3 percent based on actual
tax rates, as required by the model. However, these numbers remain relevant in the policy
discussion as evident by recent regulatory analyses. Alternatively, one could replace our example
using different rates.
5

We use the term “social discount rate” when we want to emphasize the use of discounting for
public investments or government regulation that generates public goods.

3

Our focus on a policy’s potential impact on investment or consumption is
distinct from the important question of how uncertainty about future benefits
might be correlated with market returns or consumption growth. There is a long
history in the finance literature that relates this correlation to an appropriate rate
of return (e.g., Fama 1977). This thinking has also been applied to public policy,
particularly climate change (Gollier 2013). However, such an analysis must still
contend with taxes that create a distortion between the return paid on investment
and the returns received by households, regardless of correlation. This distortion
creates a divergence between the shadow price of a dollar of investment and a
dollar of consumption. A full welfare analysis under uncertainty must contend
with both correlated returns and the potential for policy impacts on both
consumption and investment. In order to focus our discussion, this paper only
considers different impacts on consumption and investment, assuming the returns
themselves are known.
We are not the first to suggest that the consumer rate is a more appropriate
discount rate over long horizons, but we believe we are the first to provide
particularly compelling arguments against the investment rate. OMB guidelines
note that policies with intergenerational effects raise certain ethical concerns.
They suggest that policies with such effects might consider a lower, but positive,
rate as a sensitivity analysis in addition to calculations based on 3 and 7 percent.
They do not suggest that the investment interest rate is incorrect. Government
estimates of the social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) under the Obama
administration were based only on consumption interest rates. The underlying
analysis (IWG 2010) concluded the consumer rate was appropriate based on the
“economics literature,” but it is hard to find such a clear declaration in the noted
references. The NAS report argues against an investment interest rate because
such a rate is correct only under very restrictive assumptions (NAS 2017). While

4

this is true, the same could be said about the consumption interest rate so long as
taxes create a wedge between consumer and investment rates and the impacts on
capital and consumption are unclear.
There is also a different but related debate over the appropriate investment
and consumption interest rates for CBA, regardless of uncertainty about which
one to use or uncertainty in the future. In this paper, the 7 and 3 percent rates were
chosen to keep the policy argument consistent with the federal practice. A recent
government white paper, for example, attempted to distill recent evidence
regarding both rates, arguing that the current consumer rate might be lower than
three percent (CEA 2017). Another paper recently surveyed experts and arrived at
a similar conclusion (Drupp et al. 2018). Harberger and Jenkins (2015) revisited
the empirical estimates for opportunity costs of capital and suggests an upward
adjustment to the investment rate.
For those concerned about CBA’s application to regulating persistent
environmental pollution, including carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, it
is hard to overstate the importance of these questions about the appropriate
discount rate. On October 16, 2017, the Trump administration issued a CBA of
the Clean Power Plan to support the plan’s repeal (U.S. EPA 2017). In contrast to
the Obama administration’s CBA, which used a central benefit estimate based on
a three-percent discount rate (U.S. EPA 2015), the new CBA of the same
regulation gave equal weight to estimates based on three and seven percent. As
noted earlier and described in more detail in Appendix A, climate benefits are six
to nine times higher using three rather than seven percent. By focusing on the
midpoint of benefit estimates based on 3 and 7 percent, the new central benefit
estimate is brought down by more than 40 percent. Whether to use the investment
rate has thus emerged as a particularly salient discounting policy question.

5

Our paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the
literature supporting the use of consumer and investment rates as bounding values
for the social discount rate, including Marglin (1963a, 1963b), Harberger (1972),
and Sjaastad and Wisecarver (1977). We also review the sharply different results
obtained by Bradford (1975) when the assumptions underlying that result are
relaxed. As we review these early papers, we develop a simple model to formalize
ideas and define the range of social discount rates appropriate for an arbitrary
pattern of benefits. We use this model to examine long-run behavior, where we
show that the range of discount rates for benefits in the distant future converges to
the consumption rate of interest. More generally, the range of appropriate rates
depends on the temporal pattern of benefits being valued. The other key
parameter that defines this range is the shadow price of capital, which we explore
in more detail in section 4. We show that the ratio of investment and consumer
rates is an upper bound on the shadow price under relatively weak assumptions.
Based on the U.S. government rates, this would be 7/3. Using a Ramsey model
along with additional assumptions about depreciation, the output-capital elasticity,
and growth, we derive a shadow price of capital of roughly 1.5. This implies that
the range of the social discount rate for benefits several decades in the future has
already converged to roughly the consumer rate. Finally, we turn to the climate
change application. Using the temporal pattern of climate change damages used in
the noted NAS report (2017), we show that the appropriate rate for discounting
climate damages lies between 2.6 and 3.4 percent based on a consumer rate of 3
percent and a shadow price of 1.5. Using this range, we find that estimates for the
social cost of CO2 differ by a factor of two. This is considerably less than
estimates using 3 and 7 percent rates, where the SC-CO2 varies by at least a factor
of six.

History of discounting at consumption and investment interest rates
Discussions of discounting in CBA for public policy have recognized two

main approaches to identifying appropriate discount rates. A prescriptive
approach examines the ethical basis for discounting and focuses on some notion
of how society ought to value future consequences. A descriptive approach
instead focuses on the observed behavior of, and rates of interest faced by,
households and firms (Arrow et al., 1996).
The United Kingdom and France have largely taken a prescriptive
approach. The U.K. Green Book requires a 3.5 percent social time preference rate
(in real terms) for government appraisal of costs and benefits over 30 years (HM
Treasury 2018). That rate decreases to 1 percent for evaluation beyond 30 years.
Similarly, the French guideline (France Stratégie 2017) recommends a 2.5 percent
risk-free discount rate to the year 2070, gradually declining to 1.5 percent in the
more distant future. These rates are based on an underlying ethical notion of
discounting based on pure time preference and growth.
Government policy in the United States and Canada has largely followed
the descriptive approach. Circular A-94 (BOB 1969) established 10 percent as the
official discount rate for U.S. government CBAs. This rate was based on the
“average rate of return on private investment, before taxes and after inflation.” It
was later revised to 7 percent (OMB 1992), and the after-tax rate of 3 percent was
added even more recently (Lew 2000; OMB 2003). A similar guideline was
adopted by Canada which recommends using a real rate of 8 percent for public
cost-benefit analysis when funds are primarily extracted from capital market (TBS
2007). This rate is estimated to be a weighted average of costs of funds from three
sources – return of capital, post-tax return on savings, and marginal cost of
foreign borrowing. When consumer consumption is involved, a rate of 3 percent
is suggested.

2.1

The descriptive approach and challenges
This paper speaks to the descriptive approach. This idea that public

investments ought to provide the same return as observed private investments has
a long history in economic thought (Harberger 1972; Lind 1982, 1990). Put
simply, why invest in public projects that provide a lower return than private
alternatives? Moreover, if the public project is displacing private investment, the
notion is even more compelling as the opportunity cost of the forgone investment.
Arguably, most public projects or government regulation involve up-front capital
investment via either government spending or private dollars.
One problem for the descriptive approach arises because, when thinking
about private investment alternatives, observed returns differ across different
types of private investments. Uncertainty about the return to various investments,
coupled with correlation between a specific investment’s returns and the broader
market, has long been recognized as an explanation for such differences. The
capital asset pricing model (CAPM) has been a central feature in the finance
literature, positing a risk premium based on an investment returns’ volatility and
correlation with the market (Fama 1977; Dixit and Williamson 1989; van Ewijk
and Tang 2003; Hultkrantz, Krüger, and Mantalos 2014). This approach has in
turn been applied to public investments (Gollier 2013). However, the U.S.
government has largely ignored uncertainty and correlation among investment
returns, focusing on “best” estimates of costs and benefits and a single, average
estimate of the rate of return to private investment.6 A notable exception is the

An interesting question for future work would be to consider how and when such correlation
could be practically incorporated in government CBA.

social cost of carbon dioxide estimates, that posit alternative discount rates based
on uncertain outcomes and possible correlation with market returns (IWG 2010).
Distinct from the range of private sector returns associated with different
risk profiles, a second complication arises when a public project is viewed
through the eyes of consumers. Economists generally look to households and
revealed preference as the ultimate arbiters of welfare value. Household
preferences should be revealed by the intertemporal prices that they face, so the
relevant question should be the rate of interest available for household savings. In
a competitive capital market without tax distortions, a household’s return to
savings and the return on capital investment are both equal to the same rate.
In practice, however, taxes on the income from capital drive a wedge
between investment returns and the returns experienced by consumers (Baumol
1968). This can lead us to ask, what kind of return does a household require to be
better off? A consumer perspective would be particularly compelling for public
projects that take away household consumption in one period and pay it back in
another.
This second challenge for the descriptive approach is to decide, which is
correct, the perspective of households or of firms? Recognizing the lack of a clear
answer, government policy changed in 2000 to provide equal prominence to both
a consumer and investment rate—3 and 7 percent, respectively (Lew 2000; OMB
2003).
Without knowing which perspective is correct, it is appealing to imagine
that the correct CBA lies between those computed using these two discount rates
(or, alternatively, between some other pair of defined discount rates). As it turns
out, that is precisely the case. The theoretical underpinnings of this practice date
back to Marglin (1963a, 1963b), Harberger (1972), and Sjaastad and Wisecarver
(1977), who all argue that the correct discount rate lies between the consumer and

9

investment rates of interest. Here, we briefly review the Harberger and Sjaastad
and Wisecarver approaches, which provide two different framings that yield the
same result. As we will see, however, these cases require quite strong
assumptions and, weakening the assumptions, the bounding rates become much
larger—unless we begin to examine longer time horizons.
2.2

Opportunity cost versus shadow price of capital approach
Among the different approaches, Harberger’s 1972 intuition and the

opportunity cost approach perhaps has had the largest influence on public policy
guidelines. The Harberger approach derives a weighted average discount rate
with a simple partial equilibrium, in which the distortion between consumption
and investment interest rates is attributed to taxes on capital. A government
project or policy drives up demand for investment goods thus leading to displaced
private investment and reduced consumption (i.e. by the same amount of
increased savings). In the partial equilibrium model, the opportunity cost of
capital for public projects 𝜌ℎ can be derived graphically7.
𝜌ℎ =

Δ𝐶
Δ𝐼
𝑟𝑐 +
𝑟,
Δ𝐶 + Δ𝐼
Δ𝐶 + Δ𝐼 𝑖

(1)

where Δ𝐶 and Δ𝐼 are the share of reduced consumption and private investment
from the public investment. Equation (1) indicates that the required return on the
public project is the weighted average of the consumer rate 𝑟𝑐 and investment rate
𝑟𝑖 – the opportunity cost.

7

See Appendix B for details.

10

Harberger’s partial equilibrium analysis has been derived in a general
equilibrium context by Sandmo and Drèze (1971) and Drèze (1974) for both the
case of a two-period economy and the case of an infinite horizon where
investments (public and private) yield a perpetual return. This approach views the
rates of return as the relevant prices associated with investment and consumption
displaced by a public investment. Implicit in this approach is that public and
private investment have similar patterns of future returns over time (and, more
specifically, as either a perpetuity or entirely in the next, final period).
An alternative approach is to focus on the implied consumption impact of
any action and then to discount at the consumer rate of interest. That is, any
investment effects are first translated into future consumption impacts, then
discounted back to the period of the investment effect using the consumer rate.
This places consumer valuation at the center of the analysis (Marglin 1963a,
1963b; Dasgupta, Marglin, and Sen 1972; Bradford 1975). This generally leads
one dollar of investment in any period to be valued more than one dollar of
consumption in that period when there is a tax distortion. This ratio is referred to
as the shadow price of capital. More generally, shadow prices are appropriate for
either unpriced goods that affect household utility or, as in the case of investment,
priced goods where the price is distorted by taxes, regulation, or market failures.
The shadow price of such a good in period t reflects the equivalent dollar change
in period t consumption from a dollar change in that good at the established
equilibrium. Once we have consumption-equivalent changes in each period, the
overall net present value (NPV) is computed using a consumption rate of interest.
2.3

A general model to reconcile the two approaches
We would expect the opportunity cost approach and shadow price of

capital approach to deliver the same result when assumptions about the pattern of
investment returns are the same. Sjaastad and Wisecarver (1977) show precisely

11

this result for both aforementioned cases related to the opportunity cost approach:
a two-period economy and a perpetual stream of constant benefits. We now
develop those cases on our way to the most general possible model.
The first case essentially follows Harberger. Assuming the world exists in
two periods, we can write the NPV of a project that yields future benefits B for
each dollar invested today as
𝑁𝑃𝑉 = −𝜃0 +

𝐵
,
(1 + 𝑟𝑐 )

(2)

where rc is the consumption rate of interest and 𝜃0 is the social opportunity cost
per government dollar spent today in terms of household consumption:
𝜃0 = 𝛼 ⋅ 𝑣 + (1 − 𝛼) ⋅ 1.

(3)

In this definition, α is the share of today’s cost displacing capital and (1 – α) is the
share of displacing consumption. The shadow price of capital is denoted by 𝑣.
The parameter 𝜃0 is therefore bounded by 1 and 𝑣. Without a future beyond the
second period, it is easy to figure out the shadow price of a capital investment
with return ri as (4) in a two-period model,
𝑣2𝑝 =

1 + 𝑟𝑖
.
1 + 𝑟𝑐

(4)

That is, the value of the investment today is the gross return, including return of
principal, 1 + ri valued in terms of today’s consumption based on the consumer
discount rate rc. Here, we use the subscript “2p” to remind us this is the shadow
price in a two-period model. If we rewrite the NPV in terms of “project dollars”
by dividing by θ0, we have
𝑁𝑃𝑉 ′ = −1 +

𝐵
𝐵
= −1 +
𝜃0 (1 + 𝑟𝑐 )
1 + (𝛼𝑟𝑖 + (1 − 𝛼)𝑟𝑐 )
𝐵
= −1 +
.
1 + 𝜌ℎ

12

(5)

This yields the Harberger result that the correct social discount rate, once we roll
shadow price effects into the discount rate, is a weighted average of the consumer
and investment rates.
For the second case, consider a public project or policy yielding a
perpetual stream of constant benefits, 𝐵, every period in the future. We can again
define 𝑁𝑃𝑉 as
∞

𝑁𝑃𝑉 = −𝜃0 + ∑
𝑡=1

𝐵
.
(1 + 𝑟𝑐 )𝑡

(6)

And we can again rewrite in terms of project dollars by slightly rearranging,
∞

𝑁𝑃𝑉 = −𝜃0 + ∑
𝑡=1

𝐵

= 𝜃0 ⋅ 𝑁𝑃𝑉′,
where
∞
′

𝑁𝑃𝑉 = −1 + ∑
𝑡=1

𝐵
.
(1 + 𝑟𝑐 𝜃0 )𝑡

(8)

As in the two-period case, a key parameter is 𝜃0 and, in turn, the shadow
price of capital 𝑣 that defines 𝜃0 . If we further assume each dollar of capital
investment has a perpetual return of ri dollars of household consumption in each
future period, as first proposed by Marglin, it is straightforward to compute the
shadow price:
∞

𝑣𝑚 = ∑
𝑡=1

𝑟𝑖
𝑟𝑖
=
.
(1 + 𝑟𝑐 )𝑡 𝑟𝑐

(9)

Here, we use the subscript “m” to denote Marglin’s shadow price (we will return
to the more general question of shadow prices in section 4). We can substitute this
shadow price of capital 𝑣𝑚 into θ0, and θ0 into (8), to yield

13

𝑁𝑃𝑉 = −1 + ∑

(10)

𝐵
.
(1 + 𝜌ℎ )𝑡

where 𝜌ℎ is the Harberger discount rate defined in (1). Again, we have the
effective social discount rate equal to a weighted average of the investment and
consumer rates.
This result, and the discussion in Sjaastad and Wisecarver more generally,
emphasizes how the opportunity cost of capital and shadow price of capital
approaches can yield the same result. Both can support the idea that the social
discount rate equals a weighted average of the investment and consumption rates
of interest. With the assumption of costs up front and benefits in the future,
already implicit in these derivations, a CBA based on the investment and
consumer rates provides bounding values.
We note that this result supports the recommended approach followed by
the U.S. government since 2000. It also highlights the rather strong assumptions
that are required. In particular, benefits either are repaid in a second, final period8
or are constant and perpetual. Our next step is relax these assumptions, beginning
with work by Bradford (1975).
Here, we also briefly note a second, subtle but equally important,
assumption lurking in Equations (2) and (6). While much attention focuses on
whether costs in the first period fall on either consumption or investment, benefits

8

As shown in Bradford (1975), the key assumption is that the distortion between the consumer
and investment rates vanishes in the second period and the shadow price of capital equals one.

14

are assumed to accrue entirely in the form of consumption. The two-period model
has no investment in the second, final period, and the assumption is unavoidable.
This is more evident as an assumption in the perpetuity models developed by
Sjaastad and Wisecarver, Marglin, and Drèze. If we relax the assumption that
benefits accrue entirely to consumers,9 the range of discount rates becomes
centered on the consumer interest rate, rather than having that rate as a lower
bound. Bradford takes this approach, allowing both costs and benefits to count as
consumption or investment.
2.4

Shadow price of capital, generalization over two periods
Following the idea in Bradford (1975), let β be the share of benefits

accruing to private investment in a second, but not final, period. The parameter
𝜃1 = 𝛽𝑣 + (1 − 𝛽) is the consumption equivalent of one dollar of benefits,
averaged across the share accruing to consumption and the share accruing to
capital. Here, we assume 𝑣 is also the shadow price of capital in the second
period.10 For a dollar of investment yielding total benefits B in the next period, we
now generalize (2)
𝑁𝑃𝑉 = −𝜃0 +

𝜃1 𝐵
.
(1 + 𝑟𝑐 )

(11)

As before, we can rewrite this NPV in terms of project dollars,

9

In the case of climate change, it is easy to imagine that many mitigation benefits will accure to
investment—damages from storms and flooding, increased electricity capacity for cooling, etc.
10

Unlike Bradford, we assume the same shadow price in both periods. This is unimportant for our
ultimate goal, which is to consider the consequences of extreme (largest and smallest) values of
the ratio θ0/θ1, equalling 𝑣 and 1/𝑣, respectively, given 𝑣 ≥ 1, and determined by the largest
value of 𝑣 in both cases.

Given both 𝜃0 and 𝜃1 are bounded by the shadow price v, e.g., 𝜃 ∈ [1, 𝑣],
the range of potential values is quite large as illustrated in Figure 1 for rc = 3
percent. When 𝜃0 /𝜃1 ranges from 2/3 to 3/2, e.g., a bounding shadow price of 1.5,
the social discount rate varies from –30 to +60 percent. This bounding shadow
price reflects our discussion in section 4 based on a long-run growth equilibrium.

the ratio cost and benefit prices, 𝜃0 /𝜃1 , when rc = 3 percent

16

Bradford himself concludes that quite a wide range of social discount rates are
possible for benefits over a one-year horizon.
The possibility of such wide ranging discount rates might appear
somewhat hopeless as a practical matter. However, this is the relevant range for
benefits just one year in the future embedded in a much longer (perhaps infinite)
horizon model. Over such a short horizon, the differential welfare effects caused
by displacing investment versus consumption dwarf ordinary discounting effects.
The same is not true when we consider benefits arising further in the future, a
topic to which we now turn.
3.

A multiperiod model for the social discount rate
Consider a public investment project or regulatory program where one

dollar of cost is expended at the beginning of the initial period, but now an
arbitrary time series of benefits follows in future periods, {𝐵𝑡 , 𝑡 = 1,2, … , 𝑇}. The
multiperiod cost–benefit flow is summarized in Table 1.
Note that this generalized problem nests the previous examples where Bt =
B and either T = 1 or T → ∞. Following the previous examples, we are looking
for the social discount rate that converts future benefits into equivalent dollars of
current costs, allowing the share of impacts on investment and consumption to
vary. As before, we begin by considering the 𝑁𝑃𝑉 in terms of household

As before, 𝜃0 = 𝛼𝑣 + (1 − 𝛼) is the consumption-equivalent cost of an initial
project dollar spent based on a weighted average of the shadow price of capital
and the (numeraire) price of consumption, and 𝜃1 = 𝛽𝑣 + (1 − 𝛽) is the same
conversion for future benefits. Here, we assume without loss of generality that all
benefits accrue to household consumption and capital in the same way over
time.11
We can then construct the alternative 𝑁𝑃𝑉’ in terms of dollars of initial

As noted in footnote 10, our ultimate focus is on the range of social discount rates; this will be
determined by extreme assumptions about how costs versus benefits accrue. The most extreme
assumptions will be that costs accrue to capital and benefits to household consumption, and vice
versa.

based on a consumer rate of 3 percent, an investment rate of 7 percent, and
alternate values of the shadow price of capital (𝑣 = 2.3, 1.5).

This definition (16) for social discount rate as a function of horizon t is one of our
two main results. We can make three immediate observations about (16). First,
using the shadow-price approach, the appropriate social discount rate depends on
how costs and benefits accrue with respect to capital and consumption, captured
by 𝜃0 /𝜃1 , as well as the underlying shadow price 𝑣 used to define θ0 and θ1. It has
a form similar to the Bradford rate 𝜌𝑏 in (13), except the expression 𝜃0 /𝜃1 is
raised to the power 1/t. Second, following from this observation, the social
discount rate varies over time but it matches 𝜌𝑏 when t = 1.

19

Third, and most importantly, as 𝑡 → ∞, the social discount rate converges
to the consumption interest rate. 12 Figure 2 shows how the range of possible
social discount rates arising from different values of (𝜃0 /𝜃1 )−𝑡 varies based on t
and two underlying shadow price v. For example, after 50 years and assuming v =
2.3, the range of social discount rates is 1.3 to 4.8 percent. This result is
important because it provides a strong argument against the idea that it is
appropriate to use a rate as high as 7 percent as we discount benefits further in the
future. This is true even when costs displace investment and even over horizons as
short as a few decades.
If we want to define a single social discount rate that generates the same
𝑁𝑃𝑉′ for the entire pattern of indicated benefits and a particular ratio 𝜃0 /𝜃1 , we
can find 𝜌∗ implicitly defined by the following equation,
𝑇

This result appears similar to a result in Little and Mirrlees (p. 283, 1974) and Squire and van
der Tak (p. 142, 1975). However, these authors explicitly ignore the (our) developed country
context where capital income is taxes (footnote 1, page 285, Little and Mirrlees 1974). They have
in mind a developing country where capital markets fail to equate investment demand and savings
supply through the interest rate. Instead, the return to investment exceeds the consumer rate of
interest. By construction, the shadow price of investment (in terms of consumption) must fall over
time. This does not necessarily lead the interest rates to converge. Rather, it will prioritize projects
that pass a CBA even when the shadow price of capital is high; other projects will wait. If the rates
converge in their model, it is because capital markets begin to function (and absent taxes on
capital income).

20

Equation (17) is our second key result and provides two more
observations. First, the appropriate constant social discount rate generally depends
on the pattern of benefits, {𝐵𝑡 , 𝑡 = 1, … , 𝑇}. Intuitively, for a given 𝜃0 /𝜃1 , 𝜌∗ will
lie somewhere in the range (𝜌1 , 𝜌𝑇 ), depending in part on the temporal
distribution of benefits. In the special case of constant perpetuity of benefits (i.e.
𝐵𝑡 = 𝐵, 𝑇 → ∞), we can show 𝜌∗ = (𝜃0 /𝜃1 )𝑟𝑐 . This agrees with the previous
result, e.g., when we use the Marglin shadow price 𝑣𝑚 = 𝑟𝑖 /𝑟𝑐 and assume
benefits accrue as consumption so 𝜃1 = 1, we have 𝜌∗ = 𝛼𝑟𝑐 + (1 − 𝛼)𝑟𝑖 .
Second, regardless of the benefit pattern, the highest appropriate rate,
based on uncertainty about 𝜃0 /𝜃1 , will arise when we fix 𝜃0 /𝜃1 at its maximum
(e.g., the greatest emphasis on current period costs), and the lowest appropriate
rate will arise when we fix 𝜃0 /𝜃1 at its minimum. These values are given by 𝑣
and 1/𝑣, respectively.13
As noted, the previous literature focused on more restrictive assumptions.
Results showing the social discount rate to be a weighted average of the
investment and consumer rates hinged on a two-period model or a perpetuity.
Later, Bradford (1975) assumed a one-time benefit payment in the second period
of an otherwise multiperiod model. We can now see these as three special cases in
our framework. Moreover, we consider our model applied to the case of a single
benefit at a distant horizon as a fourth special case. These are summarized in
Table 2.

13

That 𝜃0 /𝜃1 = 𝑣 implies the case where 100 percent of the social costs today displaces private
capital and the entire future benefits are allocated to household consumption; the exact opposite is
true for 𝜃0 /𝜃1= 1/𝑣.

Table 2 highlights that we can obtain all the previous results regarding the
social discount rate from equation (17). The simple result from either a twoperiod or perpetuity model of benefits, the complex results from Bradford, and the
convergent results in our paper—these are all special cases of that equation. They
arise by making a specific assumption about the pattern of benefits and/or that
benefits accrue only to consumption (and not to investment).
We view Case IV in Table 2 as a powerful result; namely, the social
discount rate converges over long horizons to the consumption rate of interest.
However, the speed of convergence will be determined by the magnitude of the
shadow price and the range of possible values for 𝜃0 /𝜃1 . For a shadow price of
capital close to 1, the range of the social discount rate quickly narrows down to
the rate of return on consumption, although the process is slower with a larger
shadow-price value. As illustrated by Figure 2, when the shadow price of capital
is 1.5, the upper bound of social discount rate falls below seven percent after a
decade and the possible range shrinks to 4 to 2 percent after three decades. For the
high shadow price case (i.e. 𝑣 = 2.3), on the other hand, it takes twice the number
of years. In the next section, we consider two approaches to specifying the
shadow price of capital and, in turn, estimating the range of possible social
discount rates at each horizon.
4.

The shadow price of capital
We consider two approaches to estimate the shadow price of capital in our

calculations. Both approaches start with consideration of a small change in capital
today, trace the impacts over time, and then compute the NPV of the resulting
changes in consumption at the consumer interest rate. The key parameter in the
resulting expression is the savings rate. In one approach, we consider a reasonable

23

way to bound the savings rate. In the other, we calculate the savings rate assuming
an underlying Ramsey growth model.
We have already noted the general approach in Marglin (1963a, 1963b)
and Sjaastad and Wisecarver (1977). They assumed any change in capital
generated a perpetuity of flows at rate ri, all accruing to consumption. In turn,
they showed that 𝑣 = 𝑟𝑖 /𝑟𝑐 . However, a more careful consideration requires
thinking about whether flows accrue to consumption or investment, what to
assume about tax revenue, and the role of depreciation (Bradford 1975;
Mendelsohn 1981, 1983; Lind 1982; Lyon 1990).
Following Lyon (1990), we specify a constant savings rate s from
incremental gross capital returns, equal to net returns ri plus depreciation μ. We
then think about stepping through the sequence of events after an incremental
change in capital. A change in private investment Δ𝐾𝑡 in period t produces a
return equal to the gross rate of return from capital before depreciation of Δ𝑌𝑡+1 =
(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)Δ𝐾𝑡 in period t + 1. This return will be divided between reinvestment,
Δ𝑍𝑡+1 = 𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)Δ𝐾𝑡 , taxes on the net capital return, 𝜏𝑟𝑖 Δ𝐾𝑡 , and direct
consumption, Δ𝑌𝑡+1 − Δ𝑍𝑡+1 − 𝜏𝑟𝑖 Δ𝐾𝑡 , in period t + 1. Capital stock in the next
period will increase by the amount reinvested net of depreciation.
As a rule of thumb in welfare analysis, the change in taxes is assumed to
generate current-period government spending that increases current-period

24

consumption dollar for dollar.14 Thus the total flow to household consumption is
Δ𝑌𝑡+1 − Δ𝑍𝑡+1 .
The dynamics of Δ𝐾𝑡 -induced flows are illustrated in Figure 3 for the first
period after an incremental change in the capital stock. The flow to consumption
(including the benefit from government spending) is given by Δ𝐶𝑡+1 =
(1 − 𝑠)(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)Δ𝐾𝑡 . Tracing out the next period based on the new Δ𝐾𝑡+1 =
(𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇) + (1 − 𝜇))Δ𝐾𝑡 yields
Δ𝐶𝑡+2 = (1 − 𝑠)(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)Δ𝐾𝑡+1

(18)

= (1 − 𝑠)(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)(𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇) + (1 − 𝜇))Δ𝐾𝑡 .
Repeating this every period and constructing the discounted sum of consumption
changes at the consumption rate of interest yields (see Appendix C for additional
details)
𝑣=

(1 − 𝑠)(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)
.
𝑟𝑐 + 𝜇 − 𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)

(19)

One way to understand (19) is to consider the numerator and denominator.
For a given capital stock deviation in any period, the numerator gives the portion
flowing to household welfare. That is, it equals the gross return 𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇, times the
nonreinvested fraction 1 − 𝑠. The denominator then reflects the adjustments

14

One could assume tax revenues flow at least partly into government projects/investment that
then provide consumer benefits in future periods, that government funds exceed the value of
consumption, or both. This is easily accommodated in the current framework by considering that
each dollar of such government investment will have an equivalent current-period consumption
value greater than one—what is referred to as the “marginal value of public funds.” Allowing this
shadow price to be vG, the numerator in (19) would be replaced by (1 − 𝑠)(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇) + (𝑣𝐺 − 1)𝜏𝑟𝑖 .
That is, each period has a “bonus” from tax revenue being diverted into more valuable public
projects. Based on recent estimates of the marginal value of public funds (Hendren 2014), this
does not significantly alter our results, raising our preferred estimate of v from 1.5 to 1.7.

25

Figure 3 Dynamic flows of an incremental change in capital stock in period 𝑡

necessary to value an initial capital stock deviation over time. The consumption
discount rate governs the household valuation, lowering the value over time. The
term 𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇) − 𝜇 governs the change in the actual capital stock deviation each
period. The deviation increases by the reinvestment each period 𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇) and
decreases by the amount of depreciation μ.
Note that if 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟𝑐 and there is no distortion between the value of capital
and consumption, Expression (19) for 𝑣 simplifies to 𝑣 = 1.
Expression (19) replaces the problem of identifying the shadow price of
capital with the problem of identifying values for the savings rate and capital
depreciation (in addition to the consumption and investment interest rates). One
approach is to think about possible bounding values. In both Mendelsohn (1983)
and Lyon (1990), they consider the condition necessary for the shadow price of

26

capital to be finite. This amounts to a condition that consumption grows more
slowly than the consumption interest rate.15
However, we would argue that a more reasonable condition for a steadystate economy is to have a nonexplosive capital stock (i.e., Δ𝐾𝑡+1 ≤ Δ𝐾𝑡 ). That is,
if one adds or subtracts a little capital from the economy, it goes back to its
original equilibrium or path. This implies that reinvestment 𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)Δ𝐾𝑡 should
be less than depreciation, 𝜇Δ𝐾𝑡 , or
𝑠≤

𝜇
.
𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇

(20)

Using this expression we can bound the numerator in (19), (1 − 𝑠)(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇) ≤ 𝑟𝑖 ,
and the denominator, 𝑟𝑐 + 𝜇 − 𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇) ≥ 𝑟𝑐 . So, the shadow price of capital at
steady state is less than the ratio of the two interest rates. We also know this ratio
equals 1 if no distortion from taxes is imposed to the market (𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟𝑐 ). Putting
these together,
𝑟𝑖
.
𝑟𝑐

1≤ 𝑣≤

(21)

That is, we have replicated Marglin’s (and others) shadow price of capital as a
maximum shadow price under what we believe are more general/appropriate
conditions.
If we focus on the government’s values of 7 and 3 percent for ri and rc,
respectively, we have the upper bound for v being 7/3. It is this value of the
shadow price that motivated the solid blue and red lines in Figure 2. Based on

15

This condition is specified in (C8) of Appendix C.

27

those values, the range of the social discount rate becomes 1.2–4.8 percent after
50 years. It narrows to 2.5–3.5 percent after 175 years.
Instead of looking for bounding values, our second approach turns to a
structural model to see how the shadow price relates the savings rate to
underlying technology or preference parameters and then to specify those
parameters. In Appendix D, we use the Ramsey growth model with a CobbDouglas production function to derive the steady-state savings rate (𝑠 ∗ ) with a tax
distortion τ on the labor and capital income (such that 𝑟𝑐 = (1 − 𝜏)𝑟𝑖 ). That yields
𝑠∗ =

(𝜇 + 𝑔 + 𝑛)𝑎
.
𝜇 + 𝑟𝑖

(22)

Here, 𝑔 is the growth rate of labor-augmenting productivity, 𝑛 is the population
growth rate, and 𝑎 is the capital-output elasticity (capital share) in the production
function. As before, μ is the depreciation rate of capital and 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟𝑐 /(1 − 𝜏) is the
investment rate of interest, equal to the grossed-up consumption interest rate. In
the Ramsey model, this consumption rate of interest is, in turn, related to pure
time preference, utility curvature, and productivity growth, which we have
subsumed into rc. Choosing parameters from the literature (see Table D-1), along
with ri = 7 percent and rc = 3 percent, yields s ≈ 23 percent from (22) and v ≈ 1.5
from (19). The range of social discount rates at different future horizons based on
this value of v is indicated by the dashed line in Figure 2. In particular, the range
of social discount rates narrows to 1.6–4.4 percent after 30 years and 2.1–3.8
percent after 50 years. After 100 years, the range is 2.6–3.4 percent.
5.

Social discount rate for climate change
In section 3, we have shown that for public investment projects or

regulatory analyses with long-term cost–benefit consequences, the social discount
rate calculation contains less uncertainty when future benefits are mostly paid in

28

Figure 4 Undiscounted climate damages from one incremental metric ton of CO2
emitted in 2015 under a 2.2-percent economic growth scenario

the distant future. In the extreme (Case IV in Table 2), the effective discount rate
converges to the consumption rate of return. This result is quite powerful, but the
precise question about the appropriate range hinges on the shadow price of capital
and the actual pattern of future benefits over time. Having discussed the shadow
price of capital in section 4, we now turn to potential patterns of future benefits.
In particular, we focus on climate change mitigation benefits.
Figure 4 illustrates an increasing sequence of undiscounted future climate
damages from an incremental ton of CO2 emitted in 2015 under a 2.2-percent
economic growth scenario (NAS 2017). The benefits of avoiding these damages
each year, discounted to the base year, 2015, would then be used to construct a

29

benefit estimate for tons reduced in 2015, referred to as the social cost of carbon
dioxide (SC-CO2).16
As noted earlier, each year in the future will generally have a different
range of discount rates given by (16). However, can we plug this pattern of
benefits, {𝐵𝑡 }, into Expression (17) to define a range of rates 𝜌∗ appropriate for
the entire pattern of benefits over time. The only uncertainty defining those rates
is the ratio 𝜃0 /𝜃1 . As discussed in section 3, this ratio ranges from 1/v to v,
depending on the distribution of costs and benefits over capital and consumption.
In section 4, assuming the consumption and investment interest rates are 3 and 7
percent, we argued that the range of values for 𝑣 is between 1 and 7/3 (≈ 2.33).
For each value in this interval, we can solve for the upper and lower bound of 𝜌*
using Equation (17). Figure 5 plots those bounding social discount rates over this
range for the shadow price of capital v. At the extreme v = 2.3, the range is 2.3–
4.0 percent. Based on a Ramsey model calculation, we suggested a preferred
shadow price close to 1.5. Again, from Figure 5, we can see that this indicates a
narrower range for the social discount rate of 2.6–3.4 percent when applied to
climate change.

16

The calculation would need to be repeated for each year of avoided emission in the CBA. That
is, for each year t where emissions reductions occur, compute a sequence of undiscounted future
climate damages from incremental emission in year t and then discount those damages back to
year t to value emission reductions in that year.

30

Figure 5 The social discount rate for climate damages is bounded around a narrow range
around an assumed 3-percent consumption rate of interest. The value of 𝜌∗ falls
approximately between 2.6 and 3.4 percent when 𝑣 = 1.5 and between 2.3 and 4.0
percent when 𝑣 = 2.33

Of course, finding the social discount rate for climate change mitigation
benefits is not an end unto itself. The goal is to estimate the per ton benefit (and
ultimately to conduct a complete CBA). Using the pattern of benefits in Figure 4
and a particular discount rate, we can compute the NPV of mitigation benefits
from one ton of reduced emission. When we do this with the original three- and
seven-percent rates, we find a social cost of CO2 of $49 and $5.9 (in 2015$ per
metric ton CO2), respectively. The ratio, roughly 8:1, was noted in the
introduction. If we instead use the preferred shadow price of capital and implied
range of 2.6–3.4 percent for the social discount rate, we estimate the social cost of
CO2 as $77 and $34, respectively, or a ratio of about 2:1. This is still a rather wide
range of potential benefits. However, we see that correct attention to the uncertain
impacts on consumption and investment, and consequences for the social discount
rate, does eliminate the low end of estimates suggested by recent government

31

estimates (U.S. EPA 2017). Moreover, the estimates are now more centered
around the three-percent estimate of $49.
6.

Conclusions
For policy questions with significant consequences in the future, the

choice of discount rate can be one of the most influential parameters in any costbenefit analysis (CBA). As shown in the CBAs for the Clean Power Plan (CPP),
the magnitude of forgone climate benefits is reduced by a factor of between six
and nine when the discount rate is increased from three percent to seven percent
(U.S. EPA 2017). The underlying basis for these discount rates has been divergent
views about whether to use a consumption or investment rate of interest. With
significant taxes on income, particularly capital income, there will be divergence
between the rate of return on investment and the after-tax return on household
savings.
The economic literature has tended to advocate using a consumption rate
in conjunction with shadow prices to convert impacts on investment into
consumption equivalents. However, absent clear guidance on how to implement
this in practice, the government has resorted to using alternative consumption and
investment rates as bounding cases, generally giving equal weight to both values.
This approach follows early results by Marglin (1963a, 1963b), Harberger (1972),
and Sjaastad and Wisecarver (1977), using a particular shadow price and allowing
the share of costs accruing to investment to vary between 0 and 1. This result is
correct when future benefits follow a particular pattern: they exist either in a
simple two-period model or as a constant perpetuity. This result also assumes that
benefits accrue entirely to consumption.
In this paper, we have demonstrated that the correct range of rates based
on the shadow-price approach depends on the shadow price of capital and the

32

temporal pattern of benefits. For example, if the shadow price of capital is our
preferred value of 1.5, and 3 percent is the consumption rate of interest, then the
range of appropriate social discount rates is 2.1–3.8 percent after 50 years. Over
longer time horizons, this range converges to the consumer rate. More generally,
the appropriate range of social discount rates will depend on the precise temporal
pattern of benefits.
Our main result (Equation (17)) provides the formula relating the social
discount rate to the pattern of benefits over time, the shadow price of capital, and
consumption rate of interest. Applied to the NAS pattern of benefits from climate
change and our preferred shadow price of capital, the appropriate discount rate is
2.6–3.4 percent. This, in turn, leads to estimates of the social cost of CO2 of $77
and $34, respectively. This is much narrower than the range indicated by discount
rates of three and seven percent.
Importantly, we believe this paper provides a strong caution against the
investment interest rate as a benchmark for discounting in government CBAs for
projects with long horizons, when benefits, like costs, can fall on consumption,
investment, or both. Over long horizons, we have shown that the appropriate rate
converges to the consumption rate, regardless of the shadow price and the
incidence of consumption or investment. If uncertainty exists about whether
benefits, as well as costs, accrue to investment or consumption, the appropriate
social discount rate should be roughly centered on the consumption rate of
interest.

A. Impact of discount rate choice on the cost–benefit analysis
for repealing the Clean Power Plan
In October 2017, the Trump administration released a revised CBA of the
Clean Power Plan as part of a regulatory impact analysis associated with the
plan’s proposed repeal. This 2017 CBA changed two key assumptions compared
to the 2015 CBA. First, the revised CBA calculates climate damages (or forgone
climate benefits) based on a U.S. domestic social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2)
estimate rather than a global SC-CO2. The domestic SC-CO2 is approximated as

$53

10–20 percent of the global values used in the 2015 analysis. As illustrated in
Figure A-1, this brings down the average SC-CO2 value by a factor of seven (U.S.
EPA 2017). Second, although the 2015 CBA uses three percent as the central
discount rate value, the 2017 CBA presents results for discount rates of three and
seven percent without a central value. The SC-CO2 estimates are about six to nine
times higher based on three rather than seven percent (U.S. EPA 2017). Equally
weighting these two rates, the estimate of the average global SC-CO2 in year 2020
drops from $44 (based on three percent) to $24.5 (midpoint of estimates based on
three and seven percent). The average domestic SC-CO2 drops from $6 to $3.
That is, the new discount rate approach lowers the effective SC-CO2—and
estimated climate benefits in the CBA—by 44 percent.

B. Opportunity Cost of capital for public projects
The Harberger approach begins with a simple partial equilibrium that
explains the distortion between the consumption and investment interest rates.
That is, there is a supply schedule of savings S(rc) net of taxes on capital income
and a demand for investment (public and private) gross of taxes on capital return
𝐼(𝑟𝑖 ) = 𝐼𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑒 (𝑟𝑖 ) + 𝐼𝑝𝑢𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑐 . Here, we assume public investment is fixed. The
investment and consumption interest rates are related by the tax rate 𝜏; that is,
𝑟𝑐 = 𝑟𝑖 (1 − 𝜏). An initial equilibrium is given by the intersection of the solid blue
(investment) and red (savings) lines with I = S = I0 in Figure B - 1.
We now consider how a government project or policy that increases
demand for investment goods by a marginal amount, say $1, affects private
investment and savings (with increases in savings reducing consumption by an
equal amount)17. The outcome can be depicted graphically in Figure B - 1 by the
equilibrium I’ = S = I1. Savings rise (and consumption declines) by Δ𝐶.
Meanwhile, private investment declines by Δ𝐼, remembering that public
investment demand (including the new additional dollar) is fixed. The opportunity
cost of postponing consumption by one period is given by the light-shaded area
𝑟𝑐 Δ𝐶, and the opportunity cost of postponing private investment is the darkshaded area 𝑟𝑖 Δ𝐼—the forgone surplus in the figure.18 So long as the additional
dollar of government-caused demand repays that amount (plus the $1 principal) in
the next period, the economy maintains its current level of welfare. This leads to a
weighted cost of capital,19

17

In this paper, dollars spent today on public investment are not narrowly defined as costs of a
project generating financial returns but broadly refer to any public policy or regulations that lead
to government spending, alter private investment decisions, or both.
18

This is ignoring the slight difference in prices at the new equilibrium.

Here, we let ρh reflect the social discount rate defined by Harberger. That is, the
required return on the public project is the weighted average of the consumer and
investment interest rates that makes the economy whole—hence the notion of
opportunity cost. Recalling our assumption that costs are up front and benefits
flow in the future, the alternative use of the investment and consumer rates
provides bounding values for the CBA without knowing exactly how
consumption and investment are affected. The investment rate will maximally
disfavor future benefits, and the consumer rate will maximally favor them.

C. Expression of the shadow price of capital
An incremental change in capital at the beginning of period 𝑡, Δ𝐾𝑡 , will
transfer to a stream of future capital and consumption. Figure 3 illustrates the
dynamics. A change in capital Δ𝐾𝑡 in period 𝑡 will result in changes in both gross
income 𝑌𝑡+1 and savings 𝑍𝑡+1 in the next period.
Δ𝑌𝑡+1 = (𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)Δ𝐾𝑡

(C1)

Δ𝑍𝑡+1 = 𝑠 ⋅ Δ𝑌𝑡+1 = 𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)Δ𝐾𝑡

(C2)

The incremental change in next-period capital 𝐾𝑡+1 is the sum of direct changes in
postdepreciation capital and indirect changes in savings.
Δ𝐾𝑡+1 = Δ𝑍𝑡+1 + (1 − 𝜇)Δ𝐾𝑡 = [𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇) + 1 − 𝜇]Δ𝐾𝑡

(C3)

The proportion of income that remains after savings is the dollars for next-period
consumption.
Δ𝐶𝑡+1 = ΔYt+1 − Δ𝑍𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝑠)(ri + μ)Δ𝐾𝑡

(C4)

The shadow price of capital, 𝑣𝑡 , is the present value of all future
consumption changes after period 𝑡 discounted with the consumption rate of
interest 𝑟𝑐 . Hence, we can derive a difference equation for equilibrium state
shadow price and savings:
𝑣𝑡 =

(1 − 𝑠)(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇) 𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇) + (1 − 𝜇)
+
∗ 𝑣𝑡+1
1 + 𝑟𝑐
1 + 𝑟𝑐

(C5)

or equivalently the sum of consumption streams as a geometric sequence:
𝑣𝑡 =

(1 − 𝑠)(𝜇 + 𝑟𝑖 )
∗ [1 + 𝛾 + 𝛾 2 + 𝛾 3 + ⋯ ],
1 − 𝑟𝑐

43

(C6)

where 𝛾 =

𝑠(𝜇+𝑟𝑖 )+1−𝜇
1+𝑟𝑐

. Therefore, at a steady state of the economy, the shadow

price of capital (𝑣) has the following relationship with savings, consumption rate
of return, and pretax marginal rate of return to investment:
𝑣=

(1 − 𝑠)(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)
.
𝑟𝑐 + 𝜇 − 𝑠(𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇)

(C7)

We can place some bounds on this expression by considering practical
restrictions. For example, both Mendelsohn (1983) and Lyon (1990) focus on a
condition for a less-than-infinity 𝑣𝑡 ; namely, the need to have a nonexplosive
consumption flow. This requires the propensity of savings to be bounded by a
depreciation-adjusted ratio of the two interest rates:
𝛾<1→𝑠<

𝑟𝑐 + 𝜇
𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇

(C8)

However, we think a more reasonable condition for a steady-state economy is to
have Δ𝐾𝑡+1 < Δ𝐾𝑡 in (C3). This avoids a situation where a small perturbation
leads to a permanent (or explosive) shift. Intuitively, savings out of gross income
must be less than capital depreciation.
𝑠≤

𝜇
𝑟𝑖 + 𝜇

(C9)

This condition (C9) leads the shadow price of capital to be constrained by the
ratio of interest rates.

D. Steady-state shadow price in the Ramsey growth model
C-1. Ramsey model setup
The Ramsey model setup follows the framework in Cass (1965).
Aggregate output, 𝑌𝑡 , is produced with two inputs: labor 𝐿𝑡 and capital 𝐾𝑡 . Let 𝐴𝑡
denote labor-augmenting productivity. The production function, 𝑌𝑡 = 𝐹(𝐾𝑡 , 𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡 ),
is assumed to have declining marginal product of capital and is homogeneous of
degree 1 in capital and labor20. Both capital and labor are essential inputs for
production.21
Productivity 𝐴𝑡 and population 𝐿𝑡 are assumed to grow exponentially at an
exogenous rate, 𝑔 (𝑔 > 0) and 𝑛 (𝑛 > 0), respectively.
𝐴𝑡 = 𝐴0 𝑒 𝑔𝑡

(D1)

𝐿𝑡 = 𝐿0 𝑒 𝑛𝑡

(D2)

Variables are redefined by standardizing them with respect to 𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡 .
Standardized production output, 𝑦𝑡 , can thus be written as a function of
𝐾

standardized capital, 𝑘𝑡 ≝ 𝐴 𝐿𝑡 .
𝑡 𝑡

𝑦𝑡 =

𝑌𝑡
𝐾𝑡
= 𝐹(
, 1) = 𝐹(𝑘𝑡 , 1) ≝ 𝑓(𝑘𝑡 )
𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡
𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡

(D3)

Total production output 𝑌𝑡 is allocated between consumption 𝐶𝑡 , savings
𝑍𝑡 , and tax payment (with tax rate 𝜏). We treat depreciation (𝜇) as a taxdeductible expense.

20

𝐹(𝜃𝐾𝑡 , 𝜃𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡 ) = 𝜃𝐹(𝐾𝑡 , 𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡 ), ∀𝜃 > 0

21

Given 𝐴𝑡 > 0, then 𝐹(0, 𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡 ) = 𝐹(𝐾𝑡 , 𝐴𝑡 ∗ 0) = 0.

45

𝑌𝑡 = 𝜏𝑌𝑡 − 𝜏𝜇𝐾𝑡 + 𝐶𝑡 + 𝑍𝑡

(D4)

Similarly, consumption is also standardized by 𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡 : 𝑐𝑡 ≝ 𝐶𝑡 /(𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡 ) .
𝑍𝑡 = 𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡 ⋅ [(1 − 𝜏)𝑓(𝑘𝑡 ) + 𝜏𝜇𝑘𝑡 − 𝑐𝑡 ]

(D5)

With capital depreciation (𝜇 > 0), gross investment involves net
investment 𝐾̇ and replacement investment 𝜇𝐾. Equation (D6) holds because a net
increase in gross capital comes from positive savings net out capital depreciation.
𝐾̇ = 𝑍𝑡 − 𝜇𝐾𝑡 = 𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡 ⋅ [(1 − 𝜏)(𝑓(𝑘𝑡 ) − 𝜇𝑘𝑡 ) − 𝑐𝑡 ]

(D6)

𝑑(𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡 𝑘𝑡 )
𝐾̇ =
= 𝐴̇𝐿𝑡 𝑘𝑡 + 𝐴𝑡 𝐿̇𝑘𝑡 + 𝐴𝑡 𝐿𝑡 𝑘̇ ,
𝑑𝑡

(D7)

Since

and, by assumption in (D1) and (D2), 𝐴̇ = 𝐴𝑡 𝑔, and 𝐿̇ = 𝐿𝑡 𝑛, we can derive the
differential equation to describe how the standardized capital varies over time by
combining these two equations. Namely,
𝑘̇ = (1 − 𝜏)(𝑓(𝑘𝑡 ) − 𝜇𝑘𝑡 ) − 𝑐𝑡 − (𝑔 + 𝑛)𝑘𝑡 .

(D8)

Turning to household preferences, we assume a time-invariant
instantaneous utility function 𝑈(. ) that depends on per capita consumption 𝐴𝑡 𝑐𝑡 .
More specifically, assume U is an isoelastic utility function.
𝑥1−𝜂
,
𝑈(𝑥) = { 1 − 𝜂
ln(𝑥),

𝜂 > 0 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜂 ≠ 1

(D9)

𝜂=1

So, the marginal utility function is
𝑈 ′ (𝑥) = 𝑥 −𝜂 .

46

(D10)

To find the market equilibrium under perfect competition, we solve the
social planner’s problem (D11)22 to find the optimal growth path {(𝑐𝑡 , 𝑘𝑡 ): 𝑡 ≥ 0}
that maximizes social welfare. Social welfare is the aggregated utility of all
consumers, where the discount rate of pure time preference is 𝛿 (𝛿 > 𝑛).

C-2. Estimate the steady-state shadow price
We assume a solution (𝑐𝑡∗ , 𝑘𝑡∗ ) to the necessary conditions for the social
planner’s problem (D11) that converges to a finite positive steady state (𝑐 ∗ , 𝑘 ∗ ).
The equilibrium conditions can be found by letting 𝑐̇ = 𝑘̇ = 0.

22

𝑘̇ = 0 → 𝑐 ∗ = (1 − 𝜏)(𝑓(𝑘 ∗ ) − 𝜇𝑘 ∗ ) − (𝑔 + 𝑛)𝑘 ∗

(D12)

𝑐̇ = 0 → 𝛿 + 𝑔𝜂 = (1 − 𝜏)(𝑓 ′ (𝑘 ∗ ) − 𝜇)

(D13)

Tax rate is fixed at 𝜏. Initial population stock is assumed to be 𝐿0 = 1.

𝑐 ∗ = (1 − 𝜏)((𝑘 ∗ )𝑎 − 𝜇𝑘 ∗ ) − (𝑔 + 𝑛)𝑘 ∗

(D15)

Here, we have simplified the expression for 𝑘 ∗ by recognizing that 𝛿 + 𝑔𝜂 is what
we have been calling the consumer interest rate rc. It is reflects the consumer’s
willingness to trade consumptions across periods. And (𝛿 + 𝑔𝜂)/(1 − 𝜏) =
𝑓′(𝑘 ∗ ) − 𝜇 is what we have been calling the investment interest rate ri. It reflects
the pretax (and postdepreciation) return to investment.
From (D5), the equilibrium propensity of savings 𝑧 ∗ /𝑦 ∗ can be written as
a function of the parameters.

We parameterize the Ramsey model in Table D-1 to determine the savings
rate s* and shadow price of capital in (19). In particular, we take rc = three percent
and ri = seven percent (based on OMB guidelines). This leaves μ, g, n, and a. We
assume depreciation μ = 10 percent, economic growth g = 2 percent, population
growth n = 1 percent, and the capital-output elasticity a = 0.3. This yields a
steady-state savings rate 𝑠 ∗ = 23 percent, and the value of the shadow price v is
about 1.5.
