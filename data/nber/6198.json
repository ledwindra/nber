    "abstract": "\n\nWe investigate the determinants of educational quality in a panel data set that includes\" output and input measures for a broad number of countries.  The results show that family inputs\" and school resources are closely related to school outcomes, as measured by internationally\" comparable test scores, repetition rates, and drop-out rates.  Family characteristics income and education of parents, have strong effects on student performance.  The findings also\" indicate that more school resources - especially smaller class sizes but probably also higher\" teacher salaries and greater school length - enhance educational outcomes.\"\n\n",
