JEL No. E21,H51,I10
ABSTRACT
Using a general equilibrium heterogeneous agent model featuring health production, we quantify
the relative contribution of price distortions in the health market, TFP and other health risks in
explaining cross-country differences in health expenditure (as a share of GDP) and health status.
Estimated parameters reveal a substantial price wedge that explains at most 20% of the difference
in health spending (as a share of GDP) and 30% of the difference in health status between Europe
and the U.S. We estimate a one percentage point negative impact on the life-time cost-of-living of
Americans from higher prices due to inefficiencies.

Introduction

Large differences in health expenditures are observed across countries. In 2018, the U.S. spent 17%
of its GDP on health while Germany spent 11.2% and Italy 8.8% (Health Statistics, OECD 2018).1
This increasing share of resources devoted to health care is thus one of the largest fiscal challenges
facing many OECD countries, and in particular, the United States. One could argue that these
differences in health expenditures are the result of differences in wealth and that health is a luxury
good: as Americans are richer, they devote a larger share of their wealth to healthcare services. Yet,
the aggregate level of health expenditures does not appear to be strongly associated with health
outcomes despite compelling evidence that healthcare services improve health. Americans have
been repeatedly found to be in worse health than Europeans (Banks et al., 2006) and experiment
higher incidence rates for various diseases (Solé-Auró et al., 2015). In this paper, we will argue
that the cross-country relationship between health expenditures and health status does identify
the marginal return of health services given that prices and quantities of healthcare services vary
substantially across countries. Hence, an analysis of understanding why health care spending and
health is different across countries needs to account for these differences.
There is compelling evidence of substantial cross-country variation in prices for the same services, a health services wedge.2 For example, there is evidence showing that the cost of medical
interventions, the price of drugs and physician compensation are significantly larger in the U.S.
than European countries (Anderson et al., 2003, Danzon, 2018, Laugesen and Glied, 2011). Cutler
and Ly (2011) argue that much of these differences in costs come from the administrative burden
of managing a complex reimbursement system while the relationship between providers and payers
(insurers) may lead to important wedges due to asymmetric information. At a macro level, Horenstein and Santos (2018) show that the large part of the U.S. gaps of health expenditures as a share
of GDP may be driven by the markup increases in the U.S. health care sector. Hence, higher prices
due to inefficiencies have the potential of leading to a higher share of income devoted to health,
without improving health outcomes.
The quantity of health services may also vary across countries. First, due to higher prices

The idea to use structural model in order to identify wedges to the efficient allocation has already been used by
e.g. Ohanian et al. (2008) who explain cross-country differences in long-term changes in hours worked.

resulting from the health service wedge, even if evidence on the price elasticity of health services
suggest a relatively inelastic demand curve (see Manning et al. (1987)). Second, differences in
total factor productivity (TFP), an efficiency wedge3 , may explain differences in quantity of
health services. The earlier literature on differences in health expenditures has identified income as
a key source of differences. Nevertheless, Gerdtham and Jonsson (2000) conclude that the income
elasticity of health expenditures is close to one which would suggest, as Newhouse (1992) points out,
that income differences cannot explain large variation of the income share of health expenditures.
However, Hall and Jones (2007) estimate life-cycle models yielding much higher income elasticities,
which partially explains the rise in health expenditures in the U.S. These authors suggest that
income elasticity may have been underestimated in previous studies.
As far as we know, there is no general equilibrium model recognizing the endogeneity of health
expenditures, health and economic resources that allows to quantify heterogeneous wedges (health
services and efficiency) across countries. Indeed, a vast majority of the literature has dealt with
the impact of financial incentives on health expenditures or the role of rising income on these
expenditures, while the impact of inefficiencies induced by health providers’ behavior has received
less attention. In order to separately identify health services and efficiency wedges, we build on the
framework developed by Aiyagari (1994), augmented with health production as in Grossman (1972).
This heterogeneous framework accounts for the well-known within country relationship between
income/wealth and health (Avendano et al., 2009, Smith, 1999). We estimate structural parameters
and the two wedges (the health services and efficiency wedges) using a Method of Simulated Moments
(MSM), thereby exploiting cross-country disparity in economic resources, health expenditures and
health outcomes as well as within country variation (the income-health gradient). Our estimation
is performed on 8 countries (the U.S., Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy,
and Spain). Within this framework, we estimate welfare costs of these wedges using a new measure
which can be interpreted as a life-time cost of living index which accounts for the immediate and
long-run benefits of investing in health as well as general equilibrium effects.
We find that the U.S. are characterized by the highest health service wedge (ie. the highest
price of health services), while its efficiency wedge is one of the lowest (ie. the highest TFP). Our
3

Chari et al. (2007) build a macroeconomic model to show that this efficiency wedge can be generated by frictions
that cause factor inputs to be used inefficiently. This inefficient factor utilization maps into efficiency wedges and
thus a lower TFP.

3

estimation shows that the U.S. price of health services is 15% larger than the average price in
European countries. In addition, we find that efficiency wedge cannot account for cross-country
differences in health expenditures and health. Using counterfactuals, we show that, when health
price distortions in the U.S. have the same order of magnitude as in Europe, the gap in health
expenditures would be reduced by 20% while the gap in terms of health status would be reduced by
30%. Differences in terms of health dynamics, which could be the result of differences in underlying
risk factors (obesity, smoking, etc) account for a large share of the difference in health spending and
health outcomes across countries. Other differences, such as co-insurance rate or the income risks,
can not explained the cross-country differences in health status and expenditures. Overall, given
that health accounts for less than 15% of resources and Americans substitute away from health due
to higher prices which leads to both partial and general equilibrium effects, we find that the extracost of living that Americans bear is equivalent to one percentage point in life-time expenditures.
As for health inequalities, we show that health service wedge i) increases the income-health gradient
by 30% and ii) makes high-income Americans bear the largest additional cost-of-living.
The paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we document substantial differences in health
services prices across countries and discuss other sources of variation that can explain differences
in health expenditures and health services across countries. In section 3, we present the general
equilibrium model that will be used to fit the data. In section 4, we present the data and estimation
method we use and report estimates of the model and its predictive performance. In section 5,
counterfactual simulations allows us to decompose the cross-country differences in health indicators
between the size of the wedges and the elasticities of aggregate to these wedges. We then explore
welfare impacts (section 6). Finally, section 7 concludes.

Price and Quantity Differences Across Countries

Separating price and quantity and in particular constructing a comparable price index for health
services is a difficult task. Information systems are different across countries and price information
is not always available, in particular in health systems that do not impute all cost to episodes of
care. One would also want to compare the same services or the same quantity of services. This
is possible for some services but not for others. Finally, different countries use a different mix of

4

inputs to produce the same output. In Table 1, we report various price estimates that we have
been able to gather from studies attempting to compare prices across countries. The International
Federation of Health Plans (IFHP, 2013) collects data from private health insurance plans on cost
for various procedures and drugs. An angiogram costs 914 dollars in the U.S. compared to 264 in
France and 125 in Spain. Hence, the cost in Spain was 13.6% that of the same procedure in the
U.S. and 28.8% for France. Similar numbers are obtained for a scan of the abdomen or a bypass
surgery. Canada Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (2016) construct a price index for patented
drugs in OECD countries (weighted by Canadian sales). The price index reveals substantially lower
prices in European countries relative to the U.S. Laugesen and Glied (2011) report information on
physician compensation for primary care and for hip replacement. Again, evidence points to higher
prices in the U.S. compared to European countries. From OECD Statistics Health data, we find
that hospital spending per discharge is also lower in Europe compared to the U.S. (from 27% to
73% of U.S. spending). All this evidence, although imperfect, suggest that prices in the U.S. appear
to be larger than in Europe.
Cutler and Ly (2011) investigate administrative costs, given that the U.S. has a distinctive
health care system: providers and insurers are typically distinct economic agents. In Figure 1 we
report the share of administrative costs in health expenditures (OECD, 2013). In the European
countries we consider, we observe lower administrative health care costs than in the U.S.
Price differences reflect both quality or quantity differences in health care services. If so, Americans would be in much better health than their European counterparts. In fact, some evidence
suggest that this is unlikely to be the case. In Table 1, we report a measure of efficiency of health
services by looking at 5-year cancer survival rates for 4 common cancers: colon, cervical, breast and
leukemia. Relative to the U.S., the dispersion in cancer survival rates is very low. Most countries
use best treatments and practices with limited dispersion in outcomes. For some cancers, survival
rates are lower in Europe while for others, they are higher. On some measures, Americans are
using less the health care system (Anderson et al., 2003) while, on others, it appears that the use
of medical care is much more intensive in the U.S. (Cutler and Ly, 2011). However, the impact of
this intense use of health care in terms of better health remains unclear.
Other factors can explain cross-country differences in health and health expenditures. First, the
health insurance system can transfer health services from the richest to the poorest, thus improving
5

aggregate health status. Second, while higher expenditures may lead to better health, the causality
may also run in the opposite direction. The rapid growth of obesity in the U.S. relative to other
countries may also explain part of the differences in health expenditures across countries (Thorpe
et al., 2004, 2007). According to Cutler et al. (2003), part of the differences in obesity between
the U.S. and Europe could originate from differences in food production technology and regulation,
which leads to higher relative price of less healthy food choices. Third, it is well known that the U.S.
earning risks is larger in European labor markets. This risk has an ambiguous impact on health. A
large earning risk may evict health expenditure because agents need to insure themselves against
consumption fluctuations (using precautionary savings). However, at the aggregate level, capital
accumulation increases output and thus average earnings, which affects the demand for health
services and health expenditures as a share of GDP. Hence, in order to estimate the magnitude
of health service and efficiency wedges from these observed cross country differences, our model
will take into account country-specific co-insurance rate, health behaviors, income process and
technology. Hence, we propose a parsimoneous heterogeneous agent general equilibrium model that
accounts for these factors.

General Equilibrium Model

3.1

Households

Agents are heterogeneous with respect to their productivity level e ∈ E, health status h ∈ H and
asset holding a ∈ A. Let us denote et and ht the histories of respectively productivity levels and
health status up and until time t.4 A Markov process {e ∈ E, π
e(e0 |e), π
e0 (e0 )} where π
e(e0 |e) is the
productivity’s transition matrix, and π
e0 (e0 ) its initial value. This Markov process induces distributions π
et (et ) over time-t histories et and another Markov process {h ∈ H, π(h0 |h, m), π0 (h0 , m0 )}
induces distributions πt (ht , mt ) over time-t histories ht for an optimal choice for health service, mt .
The probability π(h0 = 1|h, m) of being in good health (h0 = 1) next period, given the current health
4

It is well known that health expenditures are related to age: older agents spend more on health services. However,
in our sample of countries, the age structure cannot be at the heart of the explanation of health outcomes and health
expenditures cross-country differences. Indeed, the U.S. have the lowest dependency ratio with the highest share of
health expenditures, and Italy the largest dependency ratio, with the smallest GDP share of health expenditures. This
leads us to build a parsimonious model that discard life-cycle features, unlike French and Jones (2011), Hugonnier
et al. (2013) or De Nardi et al. (2016).

status h, depends on the choice of health services m. It can be interpreted as a health production
function and probabilities are therefore endogenous. The probability of being in bad health is given
by π(h0 = 0|h, m) = 1 − π(h0 = 1|h, m), ∀h, m.

Preferences. Households value both their consumption and their health status. Households’
preferences can be described by the following standard expected discounted utility

where 0 < β < 1 is the time discount factor, c ≥ 0 is consumption. As in De Nardi et al. (2010),
health can be either good (h = 1) or bad (h = 0), therefore H = {0, 1}. We assume that the
instantaneous utility is additive in consumption c and health h:

u(c, h) =

c1−σ
+ φh.
1−σ

with φ > 0 the utility benefit of good health, and σ is averse risk parameter.5

From health service expenditures to health status. Each agent can spend his resources on
consumption c and health services m. Health services m improve the probability of being in good
health next period. Next period’s variables are denoted with a prime. In addition, we assume that
the function that maps health services in health status is
π(h0 = 1|h, m) = 1 − exp(−(α0 m + α1h )).

(3)

Parameters α10 and α11 are exogeneous and govern both the level and persistence of health, conditional on m, while α0 captures the productivity of m.
Resource Constraint. Labor income is affected by an idiosyncratic stochastic process e that
determines the value of efficient labor.6 e is the sum of an AR(1) permanent shock with parameters
5

We pick an additive specification as in Hall and Jones (2007).
Unlike Grossman (1972)’s model, health status does not affect agents’ earnings in our model. Indeed, there are
different views on the link between wage and health. Grossman favors the view that good health improves productivity
and thus wages, but Rosen (1974) underlines that wages must be adjusted upwards to compensate for high health
risks (compensating wage differential model). We chose here to be neutral.

(ρe , σe ). Market incompleteness prevents agents from insuring against the idiosyncratic risk. In
addition to labor income, agents collect capital income from asset holding a, with interest rate r.
Next period’s asset a0 is then
a0 = (1 + r)a + we(1 − τ ) − c − µpm.

(4)

Labor income is taxed at a flat-tax rate τ which will be used to finance public health expenditures.
After-tax income and assets are allocated between consumption c, health services m and saving for
next period. The relative price of health services with respect to consumption is denoted p while
the co-insurance rate (the fraction of private expenditures in total health expenditures) is denoted
µ. In addition, assets have to satisfy a borrowing constraint
a0 ≥ 0.

Demand for Health Services and Savings. For the agent, the state variables are the realizations of the stock of wealth, a, health status h, and the household-specific shock, e. The dynamic

is a set of decision rules that maps the individual state into choices for consumption and health
services. We denote these rules by {c(a, h, e), m(a, h, e)}.

3.2

The Supply of Health Services

The health sector consists of a provider and a payer. The provider (e.g. a hospital) buys inputs
from the good-producing firm in order to transform goods into health services, which are sold to a
payer (public and private insurers). The payer buys health services from the provider in order to sell
them to households. We focus on two key differences across countries which may explain differences

8

in prices as suggested by Cutler and Ly (2011): informational frictions and administrative costs.7
We formalize these differences in a simple framework.8
The provider transforms inputs bh into health services though the production function b = zbh
where z is the productivity of health service producers. Administrative costs in the health system
are introduced through sunk costs (ιpp b ), with a fraction ι > 0 proportional to firm revenue pp b,
where pp is the provider’s price. For simplicity, assume that the output of the provider can have a
high or a low quality: q ∈ {0; 1}. When quality is high, the provider supplies the adequate service to
a patient and collects profit Πhb = pp (1 − ι)b − bh . When the quality is low (q = 0), the provider does
not provide the adequate service (shirks) but bills to the payer (only incurs administrative costs).
When the provider shirks, he collects profit Πsb = pp (1 − ι)b. The payer can detect shirking behavior
with probability ζ ∈ [0, 1]. To maximize profits, the payer will propose an incentive contract such
that pp =

1
9,10
ζ(1−ι)z .

In order to avoid the redistribution of the informational rent collected by

providers through financial market, we assume that providers support entry costs to enter this
market.11
The quantity of health services supplied to households is m = q(pp )b. Using the equilibrium
price contract pp =

1
ζ(1−ι)z

that ensures that q = 1 at the equilibrium, we get m = q(pp )b = b. The

total revenue of the payer is pm, where p is the price of health care services paid by households.
We assume a competitive market for payers.
Property 1. The price of health services p increases with administrative costs and informational
frictions between providers and payers.
Proof. The zero profit condition leads to p =

1
ζ(1−ι)z

≡ P(ζ, ι) with Pζ0 < 0 and Pι0 > 0.

Property 1 shows that the gap between US price pU S and the European price pE increases from
7

The possibility that information frictions lead to misallocation in the health market was first recognized by Arrow
(1963).
8
For more detailed discussions on this point, see the surveys of Newhouse (1996), Dranove and Satterthwaite
(2000) and Gaynor and Vogt (2000), or Gaynor and Town (2012).
9
As usual in the contract theory, this equilibrium price pp is deduced from the equalization of the value of the
provider providing high quality services and the one who shirks.
10
Another way to generate a gap between the effective price and the reservation price z1 (the production cost), is to
introduce bargaining between the payer and the provider. The Nash product is then given by (p − pp )1−ζ (pp z − 1)ζ .
In this case, the equilibrium price is pp = ζp + (1 − ζ) z1 . The larger the provider’s bargaining power (ζ), the higher
the price. See Gowrisankaran et al. (2015) or Ho and Lee (2017) for a detailed discussion on the bargaining between
providers and payers, in a general framework where insurers bargain also with the consumers.
11
These costs are paid in goods and are proportional, at the equilibrium, to the size of these firms, measured by
their inputs quantities, ie. CI = cI bh leading to the restriction cI = 1−ζ
.
ζ

9

ζ ≈ 0 (the extreme case with infinite informational frictions) to ζ ≈ 1: the larger the providers’
informational rent, the higher the price in countries with informational frictions. The health wedge
increases with frictions.12,13 Moreover, when administrative costs increase, the price of health services increases. This can be the case when the number of operators/intermediaries is uselessly large
in the market, perhaps due to the administrative burden of handling the insurance reimbursement
process. On the other hand, it is possible that providers in Europe, being in the public sector, are
less efficient at producing b (lower z) which would lead to higher prices. In our model, frictions on
the supply side of health services generate the health services wedge, implying a price differential
between countries.

3.3

Good-Producing Firm

Production Y is characterized by constant returns to scale using aggregate capital K and labor N
as inputs:
Y = AK α N 1−α

(7)

A captures technological factor productivity (TFP) and 0 < α < 1 the capital share in GDP. The
firm operates under perfect competition such that profit maximization leads to

w = (1 − α) A

(9)

with w the wage rate, r the interest rate, and δk capital annual depreciation rate.
12
We can interpret these informational frictions as the imperfectly observed physicians’ effort at work by the
hospital manager. Then, the larger the physicians’ informational rent, the higher the price. This can be consistent
with the findings of Cutler and Ly (2011) underlining that specialist U.S. physicians earn 5.8 times what the average
worker does, compared to the non-U.S. average of 4.3 times.
13
In the case where the markup price is determined by a bargaining between payers and providers, two cases can
arise: the US system where the provider’s bargaining power is large in a decentralized market, and the European case
where, in all countries, a public system reduces the provider’s bargaining power, by setting the price at its lowest
level.

where λ(a, h, e) is the stationary distribution of individuals across individual states (a, h, e). Given
the co-insurance rate µ, the tax rate τ must finance expenditures. Using equation (9), we get that
tax rate is proportional to the GDP share of health expenditures.

3.5

Definition of Equilibrium

A steady-state equilibrium for this economy is a household value function, V (a, h, e); a household
policy, {c(a, h, e), m(a, h, e)}; a health insurance system, τ ; a stationary probability measure of
households, λ; factor prices, (r, w); and macroeconomic aggregates, K, N , such that the following

Data and Estimation

We aim to estimate health services and efficiency wedges along with other parameters of the general
equilibrium model for countries g = 1, ..., G. We follow a two-step method of simulated moments
approach. In a first step, a set of common parameters (σ, φ, β, α0 ) and U.S. specific parameters
(α10 , α11 ) are estimated on U.S. data. In a second step, we estimate wedges (relative to the U.S.)
using this set of common parameters, for seven European countries: Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. We allow for variation in parameters (α10 , α11 ) across
countries to capture unobserved differences in health status (obesity, smoking, etc) and estimate
them jointly with wedges. Finally, we allow for considerable heterogeneity in economic resources
(income risk (ρe , σe ) and the goods producing technology (α, δ)) as well as health insurance across
countries (µ).
The assumption of common preferences is commonly made in macro models estimated across
countries (Chari et al., 2007, Ohanian et al., 2008). The assumption that α0 is also common across
countries deserves some discussion. Given information frictions for the supply of health services,
differences in the use of inputs (bh ) or productivity of medical care (z) is reflected in the price that
was required in order to induce the provider to provide high quality care. Hence, the assumption
that α0 is common to all countries implies that the ability of any m to produce h is the same across
countries. The marginal cost of producing good health is given by

p
0 (h0 |h,m)
πm

which is country

specific despite a common α0 . Evidence from Table 1 suggest that price dispersion is much larger
than dispersion in outcomes (at least for cancer) which is consistent with the assumption of a
common α0 but country-specific p.
We first describe how auxiliary parameters are set using external information. Second, we use
a method of simulated moments to estimate remaining parameters.

4.1

Auxiliary Parameters

We use different sources of data to obtain auxiliary parameters. These auxiliary parameters are
country-specific.

12

Income Risk. Estimating income processes requires panel data. For the United States, we use
eight years of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data (1990 to 1997). Data after 1997
is collected every two years, complicating the estimation of the income process. For European
countries, we use eight years of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) from 1994 to
2001.15 We first net out the effect of age from income by regressing an household’s total after-tax
income on a flexible age polynomial and obtain residuals. We use after-tax household income as it
allows for differences across countries in social programs that may mitigate income risk. For the
error component, we assume the following process

ηt = et + ut

with

et = ρe et−1 + νt

where νt is the innovation to the persistent component, distributed N (0, σe2 ), whereas the transitory
component ut is distributed N (0, σu2 ). Table 2 shows the estimates of the income process. Overall,
the variances of the transitory component are similar. As in French and Jones (2011), we assume
this transitory component reflects measurement error and fix it to zero in the model. The estimates
of the stationary variance of the permanent component are larger in the U.S. than in European
countries. We find considerable persistence in income, with autocorrelation coefficients ranging
from 0.9697 (Netherlands) to 0.9798 (Spain). The main source of the difference in income risk is
the scale of the innovation to permanent income. The variance of the permanent shock is roughly
twice as large in the U.S. compared to Europe.

Co-insurance rates. We use average aggregate data from OECD Health Data over the period
1995-2015 to compute the co-insurance rate µ across countries and over the period. We define
the co-insurance rate as private out-of-pocket household expenditures as a percentage of health
expenditures. Table 3 shows estimates of µ across countries. Spain and Italy have large share of
private (out-of pocket) over total health expenditures, while France and the Netherlands have the
smallest shares. The U.S. ranks in the middle.
15

Data for Sweden spans a few waves only. Hence, we assign Danish parameters to Sweden. The labor market and
the extent of social programs are similar in both countries.

13

Technology of the good-producing firms. We use Penn World Table (Feenstra et al., 2015)
in order to estimate the country-specific shares of capital (α) and the depreciation rates (δk ). The
values reported in Table 3 give the estimates for the period 1995-2015. The share of capital in
production (α) is between 0.36 (Denmark) to 0.47 (Italy), the value for the US being 0.384. In the
case of the depreciation rate (δk ), the estimates range between 0.038 (Spain) to 0.048 (US).

Method of Simulated Moments

We have three groups of structural parameters to estimate. The vector of preference parameters is
given by {β, σ, φ}. Preference parameters are assumed identical across countries. Then, we need
to estimate α0 , the parameter that governs the impact of health expenditures on the probability
to be in good health. Finally, we have four country-specific parameters, {Ag , pg , αg,10 , αg,11 } for
each country g, capturing efficiency wedges, measured by TFP gaps in producing goods (Ag ), health
services wedges, measured by price gaps of health services (pg ) and exogenous health risks, measured
the constants {αg,10 , αg,11 } in the health production function.
The structural parameter vector to estimate is given by

Method. Denote the set of country specific auxiliary parameter estimated earlier χg and χ =
{χ1 , ..., χG }. For each country, consider a set of Mg simulated moments denoted

mg (Θg , χg ) = mg,1 (Θg , χg ), ..., mg,Mg (Θg , χg ) .

(11)

while moments from the data are denoted mg,N . Denote Wg,N a positive definite weighting matrix
which depends on the data. We choose a diagonal matrix with elements equal to the inverse of
the variance of each moment as a weighting matrix. For moments involving microdata, we use the
bootstrap to find the variance while we use the time-series variation to compute the variance for
aggregate moments.
We could stack moments of each country and estimate parameters jointly. This procedure is
numerically difficult and does not exploit the fact that many parameters are country specific. Since

14

our objective is to estimate wedges relative to the U.S., we first estimate common parameters
(β, σ, φ, α0 ), and (αU S,10 , αU S,11 ) using a set of U.S. targets:
ΘU S = arg min [mU S (ΘU S , χU S ) − mU S,N ]0 WU S,N [mU S (ΘU S , χU S ) − mU S,N ]

(12)

We then estimate country specific wedges and health risks given these parameter estimates ΘU S ,
Θg = arg min [mg (Θg , χg ) − mg,N ]0 Wg,N [mg (Θg , χg ) − mg,N ] ,

where ΘU S = {β, σ, φ, α0 , αU S,10 , αU S,11 } and Θg6=U S = {αg,10 , αg,11 , Ag , pg }.
Denote by Dg,N the matrix of derivatives of the moment vector relative to parameters for
country g. This can be obtained numerically at the estimated value of the parameters. When

where C/Y is the ratio of consumption to GDP, Ỹg the GDP per capita relative to US (this moment
is not included for the U.S.), sg the share of health expenditures as a fraction of GDP, p̃1|0,g and

relative probability of being in good health within income quartiles i = 2, 3, 4, using the first quartile
as a base. We define those below.
In a first stage, we estimate the 5 parameters using 6 moments on US data. 3 of them, namely
{σ, φ, α0 }, are assumed to be the same across countries. Given that it is notoriously difficult to
identify β from σ in an heterogeneous agent model, we calibrate the discount factor β using U.S.
data provided by Gomme et al. (2011): if we approximate β as 1/(1 + r/(1 − τk )) with the after-tax

returns r ≈ 5.16% and the tax rate on capital τk ≈ 40.4%, we obtain β = 0.92.
The parameter σ is pinned down by targeting C/Y . Transition rates by health status, p̃1|0,U S and
p̃1|1,U S , help pin down αU S,10 and αU S,11 . Parameters (φ, α0 ) are pinned down by the share of health
expenditures in GDP and health transition rates. Consider a simplified static version of the agent’s
problem to focus on identification of these two parameters: m = arg max {log(y − pm) + φh} s.t.
h = 1 − e−α0 m . Consider two moments, namely {s, h} respectively the share of health expenditures
in income and the fraction in good health. The FOC of this problem,

for {φ, α0 }. The same idea applies to the full model.
In the second step, we use cross-country information to pin down relative efficiency, relative
health prices and exogenous country-specific health risks. The heath transition matrix allows to
identify (α10,g , α10,g ) in each country g. GDP per capita relative to US pins down Ag . As for
pg , the simplified static problem of the agent is mg = arg max {log(yg − pg mg ) + φhg } s.t. hg =

identification and allows to check whether the model is able to replicate the variation in the gradient
across countries.

Data. We use the ratio of consumption to GDP (Cg /Yg ) and GDP per capita relative to US
(Ỹg = Yg /YU S ) from Penn World Table (Feenstra et al., 2015) over the years 1995 to 2015. We
use real consumption and real GDP per capita at 2011 level National prices (in millions, 2011 US,
PPP-adjusted US dollars) to compute C/Y over the same period. We use information from OECD
Health Data for the GDP share of health expenditures (s =

pm
Y ).

We use two longitudinal aging surveys to estimate health state transitions. For the U.S., we
use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, waves 2004 and 2006) while for Europe we use the
Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE, waves 2004 and 2006). We focus
on middle age to elderly respondents (age 50 to 75). These surveys use very similar questionnaires
and sampling frames. We also use those data to estimate the gradient of health status by levels of

16

income. We use the existence of limitations with activities of daily living (ADL), which is asked
in both surveys. These limitations include whether someone has difficulty with dressing, bathing,
getting in and out of bed, eating and walking across a room. Of course, one could be interested in
considering multiple dimensions of health but the computational burden of doing this prohibits this
possibility. Limitations with activities of daily living is a reliable overall health measure predictive
of mortality and use of physician services. It is likely less affected by reporting scale bias than
self-reported health (reported from poor to excellent). The probability of not having any ADL is
given by p̃g where argument g denotes country g. Denote by p̃k|j,g the joint probability of being in
state j at time t and k at time t + 1.17
To compute the health gradient, we use the distribution of net household income in 2005 PPP
adjusted U.S. dollars. We use the quartiles of the distribution within country. We compute the
fraction without ADL within each quartile, p̃q,g for q = 1, 2, 3, 4. We use as moments the fraction
relative to the first quartile as a base: pq,g = p̃q,g /p̃1,g for q = 2, 3, 4.
Estimated moments. We report in Figure 2 moments from the data. GDP per capita is in
general 10 to 35% lower in European countries relative to the U.S. (Ỹg ). The U.S. spends 14.7% of
GDP on health (sg ) while only two countries rise above 10% in Europe (France and Germany). In
terms of transition rates into good health, the U.S. ranks last in terms of transition rates to good
health irrespective of the origin state (good or bad). Finally, the health gradient by income quartile
is much steeper in the U.S. than in any European country.

Estimation Results
Structural Parameters

Estimation results are reported in Table 4. Three parameters are common to all countries {σ, φ, α0 }.
Other parameters, prices, TFP and exogenous health risks are country specific.
The coefficient of relative risk aversion, σ, is estimated at 2.113 which lies within the range of
estimates found in the literature for precautionary saving models. Hall and Jones (2007) found
a very similar value in their study. The marginal utility of being in good health is found to be

17

0.834. Given the curvature of utility, it implies that health is very valuable. Indeed, the additional
utility of being in good health represents 80% of average consumption.18 The parameter governing
the marginal productivity of health investment α0 is found to be equal at 0.145. This implies an
elasticity of health transition from bad to bad health to medical expenditures of -0.5. This lies within
the range of micro studies on health production function (see e.g. Romley and Sood (2013)).19
In order to gauge the plausibility of our parameter estimates, we compute elasticity of health
expenditures pm to the co-insurance µ generated by the model. For the U.S. this elasticity is -0.43
in partial equilibrium (wage, interest rate and taxation are kept constant). This estimate is slightly
larger than the elasticity found in the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (-0.2) (Manning et al.,
1987) but close to estimates reported by De Nardi et al. (2010) and Fonseca et al. (2020). Our
income elasticity estimate of health expenditures pm is 0.85 which is in the middle of the range of
elasticities reported in Gerdtham and Jonsson (2000). In particular, it is close to the value estimated
by Acemoglu et al. (2013) which is 0.7 but much lower than Hall and Jones (2007)’s finding (higher
than 2).20 Hence, our estimates do not suggest that health is a luxury good: higher income can not
lead to a higher GDP share of health expenditures.21
We estimate strong state-dependence in health transition probabilities with the probability of
being in good health next period being much larger if one is already in good than in bad health
(α11 > 0 > α10 ). A similar picture is found across countries. To get an overall picture of the
health production function, Figure 3 reports transition probabilities as a function of m for each
country. The variation across countries is driven by exogenous health risks (α11 , α10 ) (see Table
5)

22 .

When in good health, the health production function estimates suggest that the U.S. has

18

We compute this number as follows: the expected utility in good health equals the expected utility in bad
health if consumption in good health is reduced by 75%. As consumption in good health 6.5% higher than average
consumption, we obtain that additional utility of being in good health is 80% of average consumption.
19
Large number of empirical studies report the impact of medical expenditures on survival rate. We assume that
the closest equivalent in our model is the health transition from bad to bad health.
20
We compute this income elasticity for a one percent change in the equilibrium wage.
21
With our model, a large GDP share of health expenditures can only be explained by health service wedge (b
p).
Indeed, simple decomposition of the GDP share of health expenditures s of the variation sources (income y or price
EU
and x for x = y, p refers to the elasticity of health expenditures
p) is sb = (y − 1)b
y + (1 − p )b
p, where x ≡ xU Sx−x
US
to x. In the data, we observe sb > 0 and yb > 0. Given that the model estimates lead to pb > 0, y < 1 and p < 1, we
have sb > 0 iff pb > 0 when yb > 0.
22
In order to provide an economic interpretation to the estimated (α11 , α10 ), we compute the probability of being
in good health for the estimated model and for a counterfactual model in which heterogeneity in health risks is
removed (with (α11 , α10 ) set at the average European level). The gap between these probabilities captures the pure
effect of health risk heterogeneity. The Spearman correlation between this gap and per-capita alcohol consumption is
-0.43. The Spearman correlation between this gap and daily calories supply from OECD health data is -0.33. These
correlations have the correct sign providing suggestive evidence of a connection between the exogenous health risk

18

the lowest probabilities of remaining in good health, for any level of m. As for the probability
of transiting from bad to good health, the U.S. does better and countries such as Denmark do
worst. Those transition rates also reveal a kink in the production function. For too low levels of
m, transition probabilities would be negative (per the specification chosen) and so are constrained
to zero. At some level of m, which differs across countries, the marginal productivity of m becomes
positive.

4.3.2

Estimated wedges across countries

The estimation procedure allows to measure the cross-country inefficiencies in terms of health prices
and TFP (see Table 5): the health service and the efficiency wedges.
In terms of health services wedges, some European countries have much lower prices than the
U.S. For example, Italy (0.641), Germany (0.770) and the Netherlands (0.772) have prices which
are more than 20% lower than in the U.S. France has prices which are 16.5% lower. Other countries
have prices which are quite close to the U.S., Denmark, Sweden and Spain have prices that are
statistically and economically similar to those in the U.S. Price differences are smaller than those
reported in Tables 1.23
The efficiency wedge captures the heterogeneity in economic development across countries. Only
Denmark and Germany are statistically more productive (respectively 1.289 and 1.021) while the
Netherlands (0.999) appears as efficient as the U.S. The other European countries suffer from a
significant lack of efficiency but this gap is small (except for Italy, 0.710).24

4.3.3

Model fit

Figure 4 shows that the model succeeds in fitting the share of health expenditures (s = pm/y, the
Spearman correlation is 0.93). The model slightly overestimates the transition rate from good to
good health (p11 ). In the data, p11 is very similar across countries, which makes it more difficult
for the model to fit this dimension. The model still provides a satisfactory fit with a Spearman
and measures of health risky behaviors.
23
The Spearman correlation between our measure of price and OECD health price index is 0.31. If we exclude
Spain, the correlation goes up to 0.61. Indeed, ASPE (2018) reports that Spain displays the highest price within
a set of Medicare drugs in several instances, but Spain never appears as the country offering the cheapest price for
these drugs. The Spearman correlation excluding Spain is consistent with this view.
24
The Spearman correlation between our estimates of the efficiency wedge (relative TFP) with the estimates by
the Penn World Tables is 0.43, and goes up to 0.64 with Bergeaud et al. (2016)’s TFP.

19

correlation between the model’s p11 and its empirical counterpart of 0.69. The model also provides
a good fit of the transition from bad to good health (the Spearman correlation is 0.79 for p10 ). The
model matches the fact that the U.S. is the country where health inequalities are the largest, whereas
the Netherlands is the country where they are the lowest. The income-health gradient at quartile 4
is satisfactory (the Spearman correlation is 0.5). With respect to the other income-health gradients,
the data does not display enough heterogeneity, which makes it more difficult for the model to fit
this dimension. Finally, the GDP differences are well reproduced (the Spearman correlation is 0.97
for Y ).

5

Explaining Variation in Health Expenditures and Health Across
Countries

The price of health services is approximately 15% larger in the U.S. than in Europe while technological efficiency is 5% higher in the U.S. than in Europe. Our estimation results also reveal that
heterogeneity in exogenous health risks is important.
To quantify the effect of these differences, we focus on the GDP share of health expenditures
(s), the fraction of individuals in good health (p(h = 1)) and health inequalities (income-health
gradient) measured by the relative fraction of individuals in good health within the fourth income
quartile (p4 ). We simulate counterfactual general equilibrium scenarios where we neutralize each
of heterogeneity sources in turn. Table 6 reports results. We consider four scenarios: i) a baseline
scenario where all country specific heterogeneity is accounted for, ii) a scenario where we remove
price heterogeneity, setting the health price wedge equal to the European average, iii) a scenario
where efficiency heterogeneity is removed, setting the efficiency wedge equal to the European average,
iv) a scenario where exogenous health risks heterogeneity (α11 , α10 ) is removed, setting exogenous
health risks equals to their European averages.25 In order to highlight the U.S.-Europe differences,
we report the European averages of these indicators.
The baseline differences (∆) between the U.S. and the E.U countries are 0.064 for s and -0.059
25

Given that the characteristics of the production function of the U.S. goods (α, δ), as well as the co-insurance
rate (µ), are close to the average of their European counterparts, they can not explain why our model can explain
the differences between the U.S. and the European countries. In addition, the experiment in which we remove
heterogeneity in income process (ρe ,σe ) yields results that are similar to the removal of heterogeneity in TFP. For
the sake of brevity, we will not report them below.

20

for p(h = 1). The U.S. spends more but has lower health. As for inequalities, they are also higher
than in Europe, with a difference in the health gradient (p4 ) equal to 0.212.

5.1

The impact of macroeconomic wedges: health service prices and efficiency

When heterogeneity in the health service wedge is removed ("price" scenario), the gap in expenditures is reduced by 20.3%, going from 0.064 to 0.051, and the gap in the fraction of individual in
good health is reduced by 28.8%, going from 0.059 to 0.042. Beyond its estimated size, the health
service wedge has a quantitatively sizeable effect on health expenditures and health status differences across countries. This wedge has also a sizeable impact on health inequalities: by removing
this wedge, the gap in income-health gradient is reduced by 29.25%, going from 0.212 to 0.15.
When the efficiency wedge heterogeneity is removed ("efficiency" scenario), the GDP share of
health expenditures increases marginally in the U.S. by 0.003. But, it also increases marginally in
European countries by 0.004. This last result is driven by the large decline in TFP in Denmark,
the only country where the TFP is higher than in the U.S. Without this country, the gap between
a high-TFP country (the U.S.) and a group of countries characterized by a low-TFP (all the E.U.
countries except Denmark) unambiguously increases. This result is in line with our result that
the income elasticity of health expenditures is below one. The GDP share of health spending is
declining in TFP. The U.S. is found in this study, but also in others (e.g. Ohanian et al. (2008)), to
have higher TFP (except for Denmark). Therefore, technological efficiency cannot explain why the
U.S. has a higher GDP share of health expenditures in this model. With a homogeneous efficiency
wedge, health inequality increase by 10%, from 0.212 to 0.233, suggesting that this wedge cannot
explain differences in health inequalities between the U.S. and Europe.

5.2

The impact of microeconomic risks: health

Worse health status in the U.S., for example due to higher prevalence of risky behaviors, could also
explain differences in expenditures and health status (Thorpe et al., 2004, 2007). For example, the
rapid growth of obesity in the U.S. relative to other countries could play a role (Cutler et al., 2003).
In the model, these are captured by exogenous health risks (α10 , α11 ). When the heterogeneity in
exogenous health risks is removed ("health risks" scenario), differences across countries in health
expenditures, health status and health inequalities decrease sharply. The gaps in expenditures
21

virtually disappears, going from 0.064 to 0.002. At the same time, the gap in the fraction of
individual in good health is reduced by 79.6%, going from -0.059 to -0.012 and the gap in incomehealth gradient is by 66.5%, from 0.212 to 0.071. This country-specific health risks play a sizeable
role in accounting for differences between the US and Europe due to a simple mechanism. A large
proportion of Americans are in good health. However, they face a high probability of getting sick
(relative to Europe), so they spend more on medical care than their European counterparts, which
leads to a high U.S. GDP share of health expenditure. This additional spending on health care does
not compensate for the larger U.S. exogenous health risk, which leads the model to fit the larger
U.S. GDP share of health expenditures without better health outcomes.
This decomposition of differences between the U.S. and the E.U. countries with respect to GDP
share of health expenditures, fraction of individuals in good health and income-health gradient
suggests that both the health services wedge and exogenous health risks explain most of the crosscountry gap while TFP differences cannot rationalize these gaps.

6

Welfare Consequences of the Health Services Wedge

6.1

Lifetime Cost-of-Living Index

We perform a counterfactual exercise in which Americans pay the average European health price.26
We then ask the question: What would Americans be willing to pay to switch to the average
European price? We can compute the Willingness-to-pay (WTP) for each agent (a, h, e) for accessing
an economy where the health services wedge is the same than in Europe. Using the model, we
compute the welfare of each (a, e, h)-type agent in the U.S. economy V (a, h, e|pZ , ΩX
U S ), which
depends on wedge values (pZ=U S,EU ) and on Ω = {ΩX
U S }X=U S,EU , a set of two vectors regrouping
(i) all US-specific characteristics (income risk, risky health behaviors, co-insurance rate) and (ii)
equilibrium factor prices (r(pX ), w(pX )) and tax rate (τ (pX )).27 When Z = EU , if X = U S,
the values are evaluated in partial equilibrium (PE), whereas if X = EU , they take into account
general equilibrium (GE) adjustments of interest rate, wage rate and taxation. Therefore, the state

To simplify the presentation, we present computations of welfare cost of price wedges. The welfare computations
related to the efficiency wedge (A) is identical, except for the index of the cost-of-living which is not defined without
endogenous labor supply.

The transfer P X (at , ht , et ) can be spent as agents choose in time and across goods. While this
transfer is informative about the welfare effect of a change in price, it does not convey much
information on the additional cost-of-living of an agent paying the price p = pU S , after controlling
for the same welfare as in an economy where p = pEU . To see this, let us define the lifetime
expenditure function E as follows

in value functions following the health price change.

Equation (16) provides the cost of lifetime expenditures at general equilibrium when p = pEU ,
whereas equation (15) pins down the cost of lifetime expenditures at general equilibrium when
p = pU S , given that the agent enjoys the same welfare in the two cases. The gap between these
two expenditure functions provides a measure of the lifetime cost-of-living in the U.S. Indeed, using
(15) and (16), we can define a lifetime cost-of-living index as follows:

ILT (a, h, e) ≡

a + GU S (e) + P EU (a, h, e)
E(pU S , V (a, h, e)|h, e)
100
100 =
a + GEU (e)
E(pEU , V (a, h, e)|h, e)

(17)

where the numerator measures the total resources needed to reach V in a economy where p = pU S
and the denominator measures the total resources needed to reach the same welfare (V ) but in an
economy where p = pEU . When ILT > 1, the lifetime cost-of living is higher in the economy where
p = pU S than in an other where pEU .
This index is different from the Laspeyres index which would be defined in the case of our
experiment as follows IL =

cU S +µpU S mU S
cU S +µpEU mU S

where cU S and mU S are the average values of consumption

and health expenditures. This index suffers from several limitations: i) it is valid only in a static
environment, ii) does not allow for substitution and hence does not keep utility constant, iii)
assumes a representative agent and iv) an economy without uncertainty. Moreover, one also needs
to account for general equilibrium adjustments: a change in health price induces changes of other
equilibrium prices (wages, interest rate).30 Berndt et al. (2001) discuss various of these shortcomings
in the context of constructing a price index for medical services. As Berndt et al. (2001) discuss,
a theoretically grounded cost-of-living index would account for the production of health (health

After the health price reduction of 15%, the tax rate is reduced by 0.7 pp, inducing a increase in after-tax wage
of 0.5% (less distortions), even if the wage is reduced. Remark that the interest rate increases by 0.04pp.

and consumption of health services (preferences and budget). Using Hicksian measures of cost-ofliving, first proposed by Konüs (1924), our measure provides a simple monetary metric that measures
the welfare costs of inefficient health services as a cost-of-living index in a general equilibrium model
with heterogeneous agents faced with idiosyncratic uncertainty. We aggregate the lifetime cost-ofliving index by using the agents’ distribution obtained in general equilibrium for the benchmark
economy, here the US economy with pU S . Therefore, the average ideal price index is given by

Quantitative results

Table 7 reports lifetime cost-of-living indices in the U.S. induced by the health service wedge. We
do these calculations both under partial (PE) and general equilibrium (GE) and report the indices
for agents in bad and good health as well as for three different levels of income (e0 lowest income,
e4 middle income and e9 highest income level). We also report the average lifetime cost-of-living
index.
Our estimates of the average lifetime cost-of-living index are respectively 101 with GE adjustments and 100.39 at PE. The cost-of-living index using GE effects is larger than the Laspeyres index
(100.36).31 Because the fall in the health service wedge can generate GE adjustments with a reduction in the tax needed to finance health insurance, but also an increase in the after-tax incomes, the
cost-of-living impact of lower prices is underestimated by a PE approach. Indeed, in PE, the WTP
measured as a fraction of the initial total wealth is equivalent to ILT − 100. In contrast, when input
prices and tax adjustments raise households’ purchasing power (in GE), a high health service wedge
increases the cost of living in the U.S. by reducing all market opportunities: with GE effects, the
impact on the U.S. lifetime cost-of-living is twice as large than in PE or with the Laspeyres index.
31

A measure of the cost of living with U.S. health price versus the European health price is provided by the
Laspeyres index:

100 =

0.79 + 0.13 × 0.15
100 = 100.36
0.79 + 0.13 × 0.85 × 0.15

where s is 0.15, 0.79 is the observed consumption share of GDP in the U.S. over the period 1992-2008 and 0.85 is the
average relative price of health services in Europe. This index would suggest that inefficient health services impose
an additional cost-of-living in the U.S. of 4 tenth of a percentage point.

25

Table 7 also shows that low-income agents are the least impacted by the health services wedge.
They consume less health than high-income agents. On the other hand, high-income agents are
less affected by GE adjustments. As a result, a larger portion of their gain come from behavioral
responses in PE.32 In contrast, the low-income agents benefit from the health service wedge reduction
only through tax reduction and wage increase.33 We find strong effects of GE adjustments which
redistribute resources to financially constrained agents.
In Table 7, we also disaggregate by health status to quantify heterogeneous effects. We estimate
that the health service wedge leads to an additional cost-of-living of 1.01 % (0.85 %) for low-income
agents (high-income agents) in good health while it increases by 1.07 % (1.39 %) for a low-income
agents (high-income agents) in poor health. These additional costs supported by agents in poor
health are amplified by GE adjustments: in PE, the costs paid by an individual in poor health
are equal to those paid by agents in good health, whereas they are six percents larger when GE
adjustments are accounted for.
Figure 5 shows the willingness to pay for reducing the health services wedge in the U.S. for
each type of agent (a, h, e). The concavity of the value function implies that the WTP increases
with the level of agent’s asset (see panels (a)-(c) of Figure 5): a positive gap in the welfare must
be compensated by a larger wealth increase when the asset level is large. The WTP is higher for
agents with a higher propensity to consume medical care. Because the high-income agents have the
highest propensity to consume higher medical care, they also have the highest WTP. For each asset
level, the WTP is larger for agents in poor health, underlying their need for health services and
therefore their larger willingness to pay for a reduction in health prices. Finally, by reducing the
taxation needed to finance less expensive health care, the general equilibrium adjustments make it
possible to increase the resources of all agents. However, these variations in labor incomes are all
the more profitable as agents have low labor income, since labor income represent a much larger
fraction of their total income. In general equilibrium, the reduction of the health services wedge
leads to a reduction in welfare inequalities.
As a point of comparison, we compare the monetary impact of the two wedges (health services
32

In PE, only the health service wedge change. Low-paid workers, with a small level of asset, are not willing to
pay for the price change because they do not consume health services and face low earning mobility.

In GE, even if low-income agents do not consume health services, they are willing to pay for a change in the U.S.
health service wedge because they will benefit from the tax reduction and the wage increase.

and efficiency) by looking at the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for each agent for accessing an economy
where the health service wedge or the efficiency wedge are the same than in Europe. In Figure 6,
we show that the impact of reducing TFP in the U.S. by 5% (the European average of the efficiency
wedge), is much larger and implies a negative WTP (willingness-to-receive) of more roughly 3
consumption units, 1.5 times larger than the impact of the health services wedge (see Figure 5).
This larger impact of the efficiency wedge comes from the large direct impact of TFP on goods
consumption of all agents. But adjusting for the budget share of health expenditures, the health
services wedge has a quantitatively sizeable impact.

Conclusion

Health expenditures as a share of GDP and health status vary significantly across countries. In this
paper, we evaluate the contributions of two inefficiency wedges on the cross-country differences in
the GDP share of health expenditures and health status: (i) the efficiency wedge measuring the
delay in adoption new technology in the producing goods sector (TFP gaps), and (ii) the health
service wedge capturing the inefficiencies on the health service market.
To this end, we extend a general equilibrium framework à la Aiyagari (1994) by including health
production (Grossman, 1972). Beyond to estimate structural parameters (preferences and health
production) using the method of simulated moments based on macro and micro data from the U.S.
and seven European countries, our structural approach allows us to identify these country-specific
wedges, after taking into country-specific risks (income risk and production function, health risk
and co-insurance rate).
If the U.S. is the one of the most efficient for producing goods, is is also the country where
the distortions of the health services price are the largest. We estimate than the unit cost of
health expenditures is 15% larger for an American than a European. We show that efficiency
wedge cannot account for cross-country differences in health expenditures and health outcomes.
Using counterfactuels, we find that when health price distortions in the U.S. have the same order
of magnitude as in Europe, the gap in health expenditures is reduced by 20%, accompanied by a
reduction in gap for the fraction of individuals in good health by 30%. Reducing the price distortion
would result in a fall in US income-health gradient by 30% at quartile four.

27

When we consider welfare, we estimate that the extra cost-of-living induced by the U.S. health
service wedge is 1 percentage point in life-time expenditures on average. The willingness-to-pay
of Americans to access European healthcare prices is only one and a half times smaller than the
transfer that we should give them so that they accept to live with the European technological
level. Our general equilibrium approach also underlines that the reduction of the inefficiency on
the health market allows the high-income agents to be the largest winners because they are the
largest consumers of health services. Low-income agents still benefit from the fall in health prices
through general equilibrium effects, with the lower taxation and increase in after-tax wage. This
result underlines that low-income agents pay for the current U.S. health system, through taxation
and large price distortions, while they are the ones who use less health services.

Solving the General Equilibrium Model

Step 1: Households’ decision rules. In step 1, we compute the household optimal policies.
Given r, w, τ, µ, p, we determine, for each state (a, h, e), consumption, savings and medical expenditures {c(a, h, e), a0 (a, h, e), m(a, h, e)} that solve the households’ decision problem described in
(6). We rely on a discrete approximation of the state space. h takes 2 values (good or bad), the
number of e ability level is Ne and the asset grid is captured by a discrete set of points Nk . We
then compute 2 × Ne × Nk value functions. Let us make several comments on the asset grid. First,
we use piecewise linear interpolation, so that next period’s asset choice can lie outside the initial
grid on asset. Secondly, as it is standard in the literature (Castaneda et al. (2003)), the asset grid
is not equally spaced. For very low values of asset holdings, the distance between grid points is
small. This is done to allow financially constrained individuals to increase their savings by small
increments.
With respect to Aiyagari (1994)’s model, the complexity lies in the computation of two optimal
choices c and m (a0 being determined by the household’s budget constraint) that are related through
a dynamic first-order condition. We rely on value function iteration. Starting from a guess on optimal choices of c and m, for a given state (a, h, e), using Nelder-Mead optimization, we compute
values of c and m that maximize the value function (6), using a guess on next period’s value function. The new values for V , c and m are compared to the initial guess. If they are not close, replace
the guess by the new values of c, m, V and repeat the optimization procedure. If they are close
enough, the household’s policy was found for the given state (a, h, e). We then repeat the whole
process for all possible values of state (a, h, e).

Step 2: Stationary distribution. We compute the invariant wealth and health distribution
over a blown-up grid using interpolation. The vector of state probabilities over the states (a, h, e)
is updated using optimal policies and transition probabilities for shocks. The process is repeated
until the vector of state probabilities becomes invariant.

Step 3: General Equilibrium. We compute the general equilibrium factor prices (r mentioned
in (b.) in Section 3.5) then w is inferred from equation (9)) and the equilibrium tax rate τ (mentioned
in (d.) in Section 3.5). As a result, Steps 1 and 2 must be repeated until the interest rate r clears
33

the asset market and the tax rate τ ensures that health insurance budget constraint is satisfied.
When performing estimation, we omit the tax loop. Since we target s and hit it consistently across
countries, the tax rate can be set at the value consistent with the target. This speeds up the
estimation algorithm. When simulating counterfactuals, we allow taxes to adjust.
The steps of the algorithm are then
i. Compute the stationary level of employment N
ii. Make an initial guess of the interest rate r and tax rate τ
iii. Compute the wage rate w using equation (9)
iv. Compute the household’s decision rules (Step 1)
v. Compute the invariant distribution (Step 2)
vi. Calculate aggregate variables using the agents distribution. Check market clearance on the
asset market. Check that health budget constraint is satisfied. If these conditions do not hold,
update the guess of the interest rate r and tax rate τ . If not, go back to ii.
vii. Check for convergence and update the guess

Figure 5: Willingness-to-Pay for a Reduction in the Health Services Wedge: For the U.S.,
we report the willingness-to-pay for a reduction in the price of health services. We do this for three
types of agents: low-income (e = 0), middle-income (e = 4) and high-income (e = 9). For each,
we compute the willingness-to-pay as a function of health status (h = 0 for bad health and h = 1
for good health) and assets a. The willingness-to-pay is reported in consumption units in partial
equilibrium (dotted line) and general equilibrium (solid line).

Figure 6: Willingness-to-Pay for a Reduction in the Efficiency Wedge: For the U.S., we
report the negative willingness-to-pay (willingness-to-receive) for a reduction in the TFP. We do
this for three types of agents: low-income (e = 0), middle-income (e = 4) and high-income (e = 9).
For each, we compute the willingness-to-pay as a function of health status (h = 0 for bad health
and h = 1 for good health) and assets a. The willingness-to-pay is reported in consumption units
in partial equilibrium (dotted line) and general equilibrium (solid line).

Table 7: Lifetime Cost-of-living in the U.S. Induced by Wedges: We compute the lifetime
cost-of-living index (multiplied by 100) in the U.S. for a change in health service wedge (p) to European levels. We report indices in partial equilibrium (PE) and accounting for general equilibrium
effects (GE) for individuals in bad and good health as well as for three levels of income (lowest e0 ,
middle e4 , and e9 highest).
