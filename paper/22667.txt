JEL No. J2,J3,J81
ABSTRACT
To monitor trends in alternative work arrangements, we conducted a version of the Contingent
Worker Survey as part of the RAND American Life Panel in late 2015. The findings point to a
significant rise in the incidence of alternative work arrangements in the U.S. economy from 2005
to 2015. The percentage of workers engaged in alternative work arrangements – defined as
temporary help agency workers, on-call workers, contract workers, and independent contractors
or freelancers – rose from 10.7 percent in February 2005 to 15.8 percent in late 2015. The
percentage of workers hired out through contract companies showed the largest rise, increasing
from 1.4 percent in 2005 to 3.1 percent in 2015. Workers who provide services through online
intermediaries, such as Uber or Task Rabbit, accounted for 0.5 percent of all workers in 2015.
About twice as many workers selling goods or services directly to customers reported finding
customers through offline intermediaries than through online intermediaries.

I. Introduction
Monitoring changes in the pace and nature of work relationships is crucial to
understanding the forces affecting the U.S. economy and the quality of life of American workers.
Yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has been unable to conduct the Contingent Work
Survey (henceforth, the CWS), its main survey instrument for tracking alternative (or
nonstandard) work relationships in the United States since 2005. To fill this void, we conducted
the RAND-Princeton Contingent Worker Survey (RPCWS), a version of the CWS, as part of the
RAND American Life Panel (ALP) in October and November of 2015. This paper provides an
analysis of the data from the RPCWS. Our findings point to a substantial rise in the incidence of
alternative work arrangements for U.S. workers from 2005 to 2015, with a particularly sharp
increase in the share of workers being hired through contract firms.
In the absence of more recent data from the CWS, prior evidence has shown mixed signs
of a major change in the nature of U.S. employment relationships over the last decade.
Bernhardt (2014), for example, concludes “it has been hard to find evidence of a strong,
unambiguous shift toward nonstandard or contingent forms of work—especially in contrast to
the dramatic increase in wage inequality.” The General Accounting Office (2015) analyzes data
from the General Social Survey and CWS and finds that an expansive definition of alternative
work arrangements, which includes part-time employees, increased from 35.3 to 40.4 percent of
employment from 2006 to 2010.
A comparison of our survey results from the 2015 RPCWS to the 2005 BLS CWS
indicates that the percentage of workers engaged in alternative work arrangements – defined as
temporary help agency workers, on-call workers, contract company workers, and independent
contractors or freelancers – rose from 10.7 percent in February 2005 to 15.8 percent in late 2015.
2

The increase over the last decade is particularly noteworthy given that the BLS CWS showed
hardly any change in the percent of workers engaged in alternative work arrangements from
1995 to 2005. Our survey results further show that about 0.5 percent of workers indicated in late
2015 that they were working through an online intermediary, such as Uber or Task Rabbit,
consistent with estimates derived by Harris and Krueger (2015) from Google search data and
Farrell and Greig (2016a) from bank deposits. Thus, the online gig workforce is relatively small
compared to other forms of alternative work arrangements, although it is growing very rapidly
(see Farrell and Greig 2016b).
In the remainder of this paper we describe the survey we conducted through the RAND
ALP in greater detail and document the changing nature of work relationships by demographic
group and other characteristics of workers and jobs. We also analyze the wages, weekly
earnings, and work hours of those who are employed in alternative work arrangements in
comparison to those in traditional employment relationships, as well as the reported preferences
for type of work (e.g., regularly scheduled hours, permanent job) of those engaged in alternative
work arrangements. We conclude with a discussion of the possible forces behind the recent rise
in alternative work arrangements.

II. The RAND-Princeton Contingent Work Survey
In the summer of 2015 we contracted with the RAND Institute to implement a standalone
survey of alternative work arrangements to individuals in its American Life Panel on our behalf.
The core of the questionnaire was based on the BLS’s CWS. The BLS’s CWS only collects
information about alternative work arrangements for each individual’s main job, and we sought
to follow this practice. The CWS also imposes a hierarchical skip logic (e.g., if a worker is on a
3

temporary help or on-call job, she is not asked whether she is a freelancer) that we did not follow
(i.e., we asked workers on temporary help and on-call jobs if they were independent contractors
or freelancers) to gather more complete information on work arrangements. Nevertheless, we
impose the BLS’s classification hierarchy in our analysis below to make the results are as
comparable as possible. 2 We augmented the survey to include questions on whether workers
sold services or goods directly to customers, and, if so, whether they worked through an
intermediary, such as Avon or Uber. A copy of the questionnaire is posted online and can be
downloaded from https://alpdata.rand.org/index.php?page=data&p=showsurvey&syid=441.
The survey was conducted online between October 19, 2015 and November 4, 2015. A
total of 6,028 subjects were invited to fill out the questionnaire, and a total of 3,850 completed
the questionnaire, for a response rate of 63.9 percent. The ALP sample was recruited using a
compilation of methods, including a group recruited for the University of Michigan Internet
panel, a random digit dial sample, and a snowball sample. 3 RAND developed and provided a set
of survey weights to align the sample to the Current Population Survey (CPS) according to age,
gender, race/ethnicity, education and household income groups. 4 We further adjusted the
weights to account for the fact that self-employed workers were over-represented in the ALP
respondents.

2

One area where we deviated from the BLS CWS is that our question about day labor did not preface the question
by saying, “Some people get work by waiting at a place where employers pick up people to work for a day.” Instead,
we simply asked the second part of the question, “Were you a DAY LABORER last week?" Consequently, our
question was probably overly inclusive relative to the BLS CWS. To maintain comparability, we exclude day
laborers from the group of on-call workers in both the RPCWS and BLS CWS. Fortunately, day laborers are a very
small group in the BLS data, so the results are not meaningfully affected.

The RAND ALP sample is described here: https://alpdata.rand.org/index.php?page=panelcomposition.

4

The RAND ALP weighting procedures are described at: https://alpdata.rand.org/index.php?page=weights.

4

One possible concern is that the BLS CWS was conducted in February of each year,
while our RPCWS was conducted in October and November. However, we have examined
historical CPS data and found no evidence of systematic seasonality between February and
October or November in the share of workers who are self-employed or multiple jobholders.
These patterns suggest that seasonality is unlikely to distort the observed pattern in alternative
work arrangements when we compare the CPS and RAND surveys.
Column 1 of Table 1 reports descriptive statistics of workers based on the October 2015
CPS as a benchmark against which to assess the RAND ALP sample of workers. 5
Corresponding estimates from the RPCWS are presented in the next three columns. The second
column provides unweighted estimates, the third column provides estimates using the weights
RAND provided, and the fourth column (labeled “Alt. Weight”) provides estimates where we
adjusted the RAND sample weights to down weight the self-employed. Throughout the
remainder of the paper we emphasize results using the adjusted weights. In some cases, we also
report results weighted by the original RAND sample weights for comparison.
Although the weighted RPCWS sample is a bit younger, on average, it is broadly similar
to the U.S. workforce as represented by the October CPS. 6 The RPCWS sample is about equally
likely to work part-time as the CPS sample, but about 8 percentage points more likely to hold
more than one job (5.2 percent versus 13.1 percent). The weighted industry and occupation
distributions of the two samples are similar, however, even though these variables were not used

5

Both the CPS and RPCWS samples in Table 1 are limited to those who worked in the survey reference week.

The RPCWS sample consists of individuals who are age 18 and older, whereas the CPS sample consists of those
age 16 and older.

in the construction of sample weights. Nevertheless, the RPCWS sample members reported
considerably higher weekly earnings than the CPS respondents.
The comparisons of the sample summary statistics for the RWCPS and October CPS
raise potential concerns about the representativeness of the RWCPS respondents relative to the
CPS. To probe the robustness of our conclusions, we take some steps to ensure that the
particular nature of the RAND ALP sample is not driving our main conclusions, such as
checking the sensitivity of our findings to dropping multiple jobholders.

III. Basic Findings on the Incidence of Alternative Work Arrangements
Table 2 reports the percentage of individuals who were employed in an alternative work
arrangement based on the 1995 and 2005 CPS CWS and our 2015 RAND survey. 7 (The sum of
the alternative work categories does not necessarily equal the figure in the first row because of
rounding and because a small number of individuals are both on-call and contract workers in the
BLS CWS.) “Independent Contractors” are individuals who report they obtain customers on
their own to provide a product or service as an independent contractor, independent consultant,
or freelance worker. “On-Call Workers” report having certain days or hours in which they are
not at work but are on standby until called to work. “Temporary Help Agency Workers” are paid
by a temporary help agency. “Workers Provided by Contract Firms” are individuals who worked
for a company that contracted out their services during the reference week. 8

7

The CPS CWS tabulations are weighted by the supplement weight.

8

In the published CPS CWS tabulations, contract workers are further restricted to those “who are usually assigned
to only one customer and usually work at the customer’s worksite.” We do not impose this restriction in our
tabulations of the BLS CWS or RPCWS.

6

The CPS CWS figures in Table 2 (and throughout the rest of the paper) were computed to
be as comparable as possible to the RPCWS sample. Most importantly, in both samples, we
excluded the small number of day laborers from the alternative work category and we imposed
the sample restriction that individuals must have worked in the survey reference week.
Nevertheless, our CPS CWS tabulations are close to the BLS published numbers for 1995 and
2005, and they match exactly if we do not impose these restrictions. 9
The RPCWS data indicate a significant rise in the incidence of alternative work
arrangements from the 10.7 percent share in the CPS CWS in 2005. Using the weights that
RAND provided, 17.2 percent of all workers were employed in alternative work arrangements in
2015, although that figure is probably overstated because of the over representation of selfemployed workers in the ALP sample. If we instead use the Alternative Weights, which down
weight the self-employed to match the October 2015 CPS, the figure is 15.8 percent, still
indicating a substantial rise (and, as expected, the share of independent contractors is most
notably affected by the alternative weights). Thus, using the alternative weights, we conclude
that the share of workers in alternative work arrangements in their main job increased by 5.1
percentage points (or by nearly 50 percent) from 2005 to 2015.
A striking implication of these estimates is that 94 percent of the net employment growth
in the U.S. economy from 2005 to 2015 appears to have occurred in alternative work
arrangements. Total employment according to the CPS increased by 9.1 million (6.5 percent)
over the decade, from 140.4 million in February 2005 to 149.4 in November 2015. 10 The
9

The BLS published figures are from http://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/all_nr.htm#CONEMP.

10

BLS CPS employment levels (seasonally adjusted) are from http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm.
According to the BLS establishment survey, (seasonally adjusted) nonfarm payroll employment increased by a
similar amount (9.8 million jobs, or 7.4 percent) over this period.

7

increase in the share of workers in alternative work arrangements from 10.7 percent in 2005 to
15.8 percent in 2015 implies that the number of workers employed in alternative arrangement
increased by 8.6 million (57.2 percent), from 15.0 million in February 2005 to 23.6 million in
November 2015. Thus, these figures imply that employment in traditional jobs (standard
employment arrangements) rose by only 0.5 million (0.4 percent) from 125.4 million in February
2005 to 125.8 million in November 2015. Unfortunately, we cannot determine the extent to
which the replacement of traditional jobs with alternative work arrangements occurred before,
during or after the Great Recession, although it is likely that there were tremendous losses of
traditional jobs during the recession.
All four categories of nonstandard work increased from 2005 to 2015. Independent
contractors continue to be the largest group (8.4 percent in 2015), but the share of workers in the
three other categories nearly doubled, from 4.0 percent in 2005 to 7.3 percent in 2015. The
fastest growing category of nonstandard work involves contracted workers. The percentage of
workers who report that they worked for a company that contracted out their services in the
preceding week rose from 1.4 percent in 2005 to 3.1 percent in 2015. 11 Because of the concern
previously noted that the RAND sample over represents multiple jobholders, who possibly could
be more likely to report contract work, in the bottom of Table 2 we exclude multiple jobholders.
Even in this restricted sample there was still a notable rise in the percentage of workers who
were contracted out from 1.3 percent in 2005 to 2.0 percent in 2015, suggesting the sharp rise in
contracted out workers is a robust finding.
11

Goldschmidt and Schmieder (2015) document a large rise in domestic outsourcing (“contracting out”) in Germany
as well since the 1990s, with a large growth of contracted out workers being employed by business service firms and
temporary help agencies. Song, et al. (2016) find related evidence for the United States of an increase in worker
sorting across firms by (permanent) wage levels, a pattern that is consistent with a rising reliance on contracting out
of low-wage work by many firms.

8

IV. Corroborating Evidence from Internal Revenue Service
The rise in alternative work arrangements evident in Table 2, especially the increase in
the share of workers who indicated that they were “working or self-employed as an independent
contractor, an independent consultant, or a freelance worker” from 6.9 percent in 2005 to 8.4
percent in 2015 is a stark contrast to the declining trend in the share of employees who indicate
that they are self-employed based on published CPS data. If self-employment were truly waning,
one would not expect to find a rise in independent contractors, and that trend was even evident
(although more mild) in the 1995 and 2005 CWS as well.
Figure 1 provides some further evidence on this issue by utilizing Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) data on the number of tax returns that were filed containing Schedule C (Form 1040),
which is used to report income (or losses) that individuals earn from operating a business or
practicing a profession as a sole proprietor. In other words, individuals file Schedule C with the
IRS to report income related to self-employment activities. Specifically, Figure 1 reports the
number of Schedule C filers relative to total employment from the CPS each year from 1979
through 2014 as well as the number of unincorporated self-employed individuals according to
the CPS relative to total CPS employment, and the total number of self-employed individuals
according to the CPS relative to total CPS employment since 2000. 12 (Incorporated selfemployed individuals should file a corporate income tax form, not Schedule C.) It is clear that
the IRS and CPS data show divergent trends in the number of self-employed individuals.

12

The number of Schedule C filers is from Statistics of Income publication 1304 Table 1.3 available at
https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-individual-statistical-tables-by-filing-status#_grp1.

9

Although the proportion of employees who were self-employed was similar in the CPS and IRS
data in 1979, the CPS data show a declining trend while the IRS data show a rising trend.
There also is an upward trend in the number of tax returns that contain 1099-MISC
income relative to total CPS employment, from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 12.5 percent in 2012,
based on our tabulations of data from the U.S. Department of Treasury (2015) and BLS. And
Abraham, et al. (2015) report from tax and CPS data a rise in self-employed non-employers
(individuals with over $1,000 in Schedule C income but not employees) as a percent of
employment from 12 percent in 2000 to 16 percent in 2013.
Understanding the reasons underlying the divergent trends between the IRS and CPS data
on self-employment should be a priority for future research. 13 Nevertheless, we interpret the IRS
data as consistent with the upward trend from 1995 to 2015 in the share of workers who reported
themselves as either working or being self-employed as an independent contractor, independent
consultant, or freelancer in the BLS CWS and RPCWS.

V. Characteristics of those in Alternative Work Arrangements
Table 3 reports the characteristics of workers in alternative work arrangements in 1995,
2005, and 2015. Thus, the sample characteristics displayed in Table 3 are limited to employed
respondents classified as a temporary help worker, on-call worker, contract company worker, or
an independent contractor or freelancer in their main job.
13

A possible reconciliation is that the CPS self-employment measure only covers main jobs. Thus, if a growing
share of individuals have self-employment income from secondary jobs or activities but not from main jobs, then
one could see a rise in the share of tax filers reporting Schedule C income and receiving 1099s even if selfemployment in their main jobs is not increasing. But the increase in the share of individuals reporting to be
independent contractors in their main jobs in the BLS CWS and RPCWS does not appear consistent with a decline
in self-employment in main jobs in the standard monthly CPS. Some independent contract work and freelancing in
main jobs does not appear to be reported as self-employment in the standard class of worker questions in the CPS.

10

The share of workers in alternative work arrangements who also report themselves as
self-employed has declined from roughly 55 percent in 1995 and 2005 to under half (48 percent)
in 2015, reflecting the growth in the share of alternative workers employed by contract firms or
temporary help firms. There also has been a notable rise in the share of workers in alternative
work arrangements for women. Furthermore, the share of alternative workers who are college
graduates, multiple jobholders, or Hispanics have increased.
Construction and professional and business services were the two most prevalent industry
groups among those in alternative work in 1995 and 2005, but the education and health services
industry has surpassed them over the last decade. More than one in five workers in an alternative
work arrangement was working in education or health services in 2015. Together, professional
and business services, education and health, and other services represented half of all of those
engaged in an alternative work arrangement. Although the manufacturing sector has received a
great deal of attention insofar as alternative work arrangements are concerned, it accounts for
only 6.2 percent of all those engaged in alternative work, and just 2.6 percent of workers who are
contracted out.
Workers in alternative work arrangements are spread throughout the occupational
distribution. The largest number of workers in alternative arrangements is found in sales
occupations, although it represents less than 10 percent of all workers in alternative work
arrangements. The occupational mix of alternative workers has become more diffuse since 2005.
And a comparison of the fourth columns of Tables 1 and 3 indicates that alternative workers
work fewer hours, are more likely to be part time, and have lower weekly earnings than workers
in traditional employment relationships.

11

VI. Incidence of Alternative Work Arrangements
Table 4 reports the percentage of workers in various categories that are employed in
alternative work arrangements in their main job. 14 For example, 6.4 percent of those aged 16 to
24 were employed in an alternative work arrangement in 2015, while 14.3 percent of those aged
25-54 and 23.9 percent of those aged 55-74 were employed in an alternative work arrangement.
The 1995 and 2005 CWS also show a positive age gradient in the incidence of alternative work.
Interestingly, the rise in the incidence of alternative work has been sharpest for older workers
(those 55 to 75 years old) and strong for prime age workers (those 25 to 54 years old) as well.
But there was no change in the percentage of workers aged 16-24 who were employed in
alternative work arrangement from 2005 to 2015, despite the nearly 50 percent growth in
incidence across all workers. Thus, the age gradient in alternative work has become steeper.
Tables 4a to 4d provide the corresponding information separately for each category of
alternative work. The likelihood of working for a firm that contracted them out increased among
young workers (see Table 4d), but for the three other categories young people did not register a
meaningful increase in the likelihood of working in an alternative work arrangement.
Table 4 shows a notable rise in the likelihood of working in an alternative work
arrangement for women. From 2005 to 2015, the percentage of women who were employed in
an alternative work arrangement almost doubled, rising from 8.9 percent to 17.0 percent. The
percentage increased by a more modest amount for men, from 12.3 percent to 14.7 percent. As a
consequence, women are now more likely than men to be employed in an alternative work

14

The estimates in Table 4 (and Tables 4a to 4d) for subgroups should be interpreted with some caution because of
the small sample sizes in the RPCWS for many subgroups.

12

arrangement. The contrasting trends were particularly stark for the independent contractor
category with a drop in incidence for men and a large rise for women as shown in Table 4(a).
Workers in all educational categories experienced a rise in the likelihood of working in an
alternative work arrangement. Alternative work arrangements were most prevalent in the
construction and professional business services industries in 2005. Although workers in these
industries continue to have a high likelihood of being employed in alternative work
arrangements, the growth of alternative work arrangements has been much greater in previously
lagging sectors including transportation and warehousing, information and communications,
education and health care, agriculture, and public administration. Figure 2 illustrates trends from
1995 to 2015 in the share of workers in alternative work arrangements by key industries.
Occupational groups experiencing particularly large increases in nonstandard work from
2005 to 2015 include computer and mathematical, community and social service, education,
healthcare, legal, protective service, personal care, and transportation jobs.

Is Alternative Work Growing in High- or Low-Wage Sectors?
To assess whether alternative work is growing in higher or lower wage sectors of the
labor market, we used the following regression approach. We first used the 2005 CPS Merged
Outgoing Rotation Groups (MORG) file to estimate a “kitchen sink Mincer regression” of the
form:
Yi = Xib + ei ,
where Yi is individual “i’s” log hourly wage rate, Xi is a vector of predictor variables including
years of education, years of potential experience, potential experience squared, and dummy
variables indicating race, Hispanic ethnicity, sex, industry, and occupation. This regression is
13

meant for descriptive purposes only, and the 2005 CPS MORG sample was used to estimate the
regression because it is in the middle of the three surveys. With the descriptive regression in
hand, we determined quintile cutoffs based on the distribution of

using the full 2005

MORG file.
We then predicted

for each individual in the 1995 and 2005 CPS CWS and the 2015

RPCWS using the individual’s characteristics Xi and the vector of regression coefficients b
to assign individuals to a quintile of the

estimated from the 2005 MORG file. We used

predicted wage distribution based on the 2005 quintile wage cutoffs, and computed the weighted
probability that an individual in the quintile was employed in an alternative work arrangement.
To carry out this exercise, we found it necessary to make one further adjustment to the
2015 RAND sample weights. In particular, we adjusted the sample weights so that the fractions
of workers and self-employed workers in each predicted quintile matched the fractions in each
predicted quintile from the October 2015 CPS. This reweighting was necessary because the
RPCWS data under-represented the proportion of workers and over-represented the proportion of
self-employed workers that were predicted to be in the lower quintiles, even though the initial
RAND weights did a reasonable job of approximating the distribution of average worker
characteristics as shown in Table 1.
Figure 3 reports the results of this exercise. To make the patterns easier to detect, in
addition to showing the percentage of workers in each predicted wage quintile who are employed
in an alternative work arrangement, the figure also shows the OLS regression line through the
five percentages each year. It is clear from Figure 3 that the incidence of alternative work is
greater among workers who are predicted to have higher wages. The rise in the incidence of
14

alternative work arrangements from 1995 to 2015 is similar across the predicted wage
distribution as indicated by the almost parallel upward shifts in the regression lines from 1995 to
2005 to 2015.
Figures 3(a) through 3(d) present the corresponding graphs for each category of
alternative work arrangements, showing the percent of independent contractors, on-call workers,
temporary help agency workers, and contracted-out workers by predicted wage quintile,
respectively. Three patterns are notable. First, the upward sloping relationships found in Figure
3 are primarily due to independent contractors (including independent consultants and
freelancers). Second, and not surprisingly, the likelihood that workers are employed in
temporary help agency jobs and on-call jobs is higher in the lower predicted-wage quintiles than
in the higher predicted-wage quintiles. Third, there was a notable rise in the likelihood of
workers being contracted out to other firms for those in the highest predicted-wage quintiles,
rendering a sharply upward sloping pattern by 2015. Thus, in 2015, workers with attributes and
jobs that are associated with higher wages are more likely to have their services contracted out
than are those with attributes and jobs that are associated with lower wages. Indeed, the lowest
predicted quintile-wage group did not experience a rise in contract work.

VII. Online and Offline Intermediated Work
A major goal when we designed our questionnaire was to provide the first nationallyrepresentative survey-based estimates of the percent of workers working in what has been
variously called “the gig economy,” the “sharing economy,” the “online platform economy,” or
the “on-demand economy.” Our approach was to first ask workers: “On either your main job or
a secondary job, do you do direct selling to customers?” We then followed up by asking about
15

the nature of their direct selling activities. A total of 19.4 percent of U.S. employees responded
that they were engaged in direct selling to customers on their job. The direct selling of goods or
services to customers is widespread among U.S. workers, and it goes far beyond retail sales
clerks.
Of those who engaged in direct selling, however, only 7 percent answered that they
worked with an intermediary, such as Avon or Uber, in their direct selling activity. Among those
workers who said they worked with an intermediary, about one-third said that the intermediary is
online, such as Uber or TaskRabbit, and two-thirds reported that the intermediary is offline.
Thus, only about 0.5 percent of all workers identify customers through an online intermediary.
This figure, which requires many caveats (such as the ambiguity of the term “direct selling” and
the small sample size) is nonetheless remarkably close to Harris and Krueger’s (2015) estimate
of 0.4 percent of the workforce based on the frequency of Google searches for terms related to
online intermediaries and to Farrell and Greig’s (2016a) estimate of 0.6 percent of the workingage population (or approximately 0.4 percent of the workforce) based on the frequency of bank
deposits from online work platforms.

VIII. Wages and Hours
We can compare earnings and work hours of workers in alternative work arrangements
and those in traditional employment. 15 The 2005 CWS collected earnings information from
workers in contingent and alternative work arrangements in rotation groups 1-3 and 5-7, and

15

See Goldschmidt and Schmieder (2015) and Dube and Kaplan (2010) for longitudinal evidence on the
(approximately 10 percent) wage decline that security guards and janitors incur when they transition from direct
employees to employees of business services firms in Germany and the United States, respectively.

16

earnings of all employees in rotation groups 4 and 8. 16 Although we cannot distinguish between
workers in alternative and traditional employment arrangements in rotation groups 4 and 8,
because workers in alternative employment arrangements comprised only 10 percent of all
workers at that time, the vast majority of employees were in a traditional employment
relationship. Thus, by assigning all employees in rotation groups 4 and 8 to the category of
traditional employment and comparing them to workers identified in an alternative work
arrangement in the other rotation groups, we only attenuate differences in earnings or hours by a
small amount (approximately 10 percent). 17
Another limitation of the CPS is that earnings are only available for the main job. For the
RPCWS data, however, we collected separate information on earnings in the main job and all
other jobs combined.
Table 5 presents wage regressions where the dependent variable is the natural logarithm
of hourly earnings on the main job. 18 The first column reports results for a regression with the
2005 CWS data that only includes four dummy variables indicating each of the four categories of
alternative work arrangements; the base group is all employees. The second column contains a
standard Mincer wage regression (with controls for education, experience, race/ethnicity, and
sex) augmented to include the alternative work arrangement dummies. The third column
contains the augmented Mincer regression with the addition of 22 occupation dummy variables.
16

Earnings information was not collected for workers in a traditional employment relationship in rotation groups 1-3
and 5-7; and information on alternative work arrangements was not collected for workers in rotation groups 4 and 8.
We exclude contingent workers who are not in alternative work arrangements in rotation groups 1-3 and 5-7.
If θ is the proportion of workers in an alternative employment arrangement, the difference in mean earnings
between workers in an alternative work arrangement and all workers will be (1-θ) times the difference in mean
earnings between workers in an alternative work arrangement and workers in a traditional employment arrangement.
17

18

Hourly earnings were derived as weekly earnings (censored below $50 per week) divided by actual hours worked
on the main job, and are censored below $1 per hour and above $1,000 per hour.

17

Columns 4-6 present the corresponding regressions with the 2015 RPCWS data (although the
base group consists exclusively of those in a traditional employment relationship).
Before conditioning on covariates, the 2005 and 2015 results are similar: freelancers and
contract workers are paid more per hour than traditional employees, while temporary help and
on-call workers are paid less. (We discount the positive but quite imprecise estimate for on-call
workers in the RPCWS.) When we control for personal characteristics and occupation in the
2005 CWS, the penalty associated with working for a temporary help agency shrinks but remains
significant and the other differentials all become small and statistically insignificant. In the
RPCWS, the estimates are less precise, but independent contractors continue to earn a positive
hourly wage premium even after conditioning on personal characteristics and occupation. A
positive hourly wage premium for independent contractors could partially reflect a compensating
differential for lower benefits and the need to pay self-employment taxes. But, given the
imprecision of the estimates, we recommend caution in interpreting the estimated coefficients
using the RPCWS.
Table 6 contains analogous regression results for the log of weekly earnings, and the
pattern of results is clearer after conditioning on covariates. In the CWS, all of the categories of
alternative work exhibit a large negative weekly wage differential relative to all employees
except workers provided through a contract company, and in the RPCWS, all of the alternative
work categories, including contract workers, are paid less per week than workers in a traditional
employment relationship conditional on the listed personal characteristics and occupation
dummies. Independent contractors, for example, earn 33 log points less per week than
employees with similar characteristics, even though they earn 16 log points more per hour.
Appendix Table A presents regressions for the log of hourly and weekly wages combining
18

earnings and hours on the main job and any secondary jobs for the RPCWS sample, with similar
results to those for the main job shown in Tables 5 and 6. Obviously, the contrast between the
hourly and weekly wage differentials in the main job for alternative vs. traditional workers
(mechanically) reflects lower weekly hours in the main job for those in alternative work
arrangements, which we turn to next.
Table 7 reports regressions where the dependent variable is the log of hours worked on
all jobs. The results show a consistent pattern with workers in alternative work arrangements
working considerably fewer hours per week than traditional employees. 19 The gap in average
work hours is largest for on-call workers and smallest for contract workers, although it appears to
be a ubiquitous feature of working in an alternative employment arrangement.
An important question to address is whether work hours are typically lower for workers
in alternative work arrangements by choice, or because these workers often face “hours
constraints” that limit their work hours. We can provide some purchase into this question by
comparing the frequency with which workers in alternative work arrangements and traditional
jobs report that they are working involuntarily part-time. We did not ask about part-time for
economic reasons in the RPCWS, but the information is available from the 2005 CWS. Workers
are classified as part-time for an economic reason if they worked less than 35 hours in the survey
week in all jobs combined and cited a reason such as slack work or unfavorable business
conditions, inability to find full-time work, or seasonal declines in demand as the reason for their
part-time hours. Workers in alternative work arrangements are more than twice as likely as other
workers to be classified as part-time for economic reasons (7.6 percent versus 3.3 percent). On19

The lower weekly hours for alternative workers shown in Table 7 is quite similar when limiting the analysis to the
main job, as can be seen by taking the differences between the coefficients on alternative work category indicators
for log weekly wages in Table 6 and the corresponding coefficients for log hourly wages in Table 5.

19

call and temporary help agency workers were the most likely to be classified as part-time for
economic reasons (13.2 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively), while independent contractors
and contracted-out workers were less likely to be so classified (6.0 percent and 6.5 percent,
respectively), but all four alternative groups were more likely to be classified as part-time for
economic reasons than were traditional employees.

IX. Worker Satisfaction with Work Arrangements
The CWS asked workers who identified themselves as paid by a temporary help agency,
on a temporary job, on-call workers, and independent contractors whether they would prefer a
traditional employment arrangement over their current arrangement. The specific questions were
tailored to the particular work arrangement. Temporary help agency employees were asked,
“Would you prefer a job with a different type of employer?” All workers who reported that they
were on a temporary job – including those employed by a temporary help agency – were asked,
“Would you prefer to have a job that is permanent rather than temporary?” 20 On-call workers
were asked, “Would you prefer a job where you worked regularly scheduled hours?” And
workers who were self-employed as an independent contractor or freelancer were asked, “Would
you prefer to work for someone else rather than being an independent contractor?” (Workers
who were contracted out to provide services to another company were not asked whether they
would prefer to work directly for that other company.) The response set in each case was “no,”
“yes,” “don’t know,” “refused,” and “depends”.

20

A temporary job was defined as a job that “lasts only for a limited time or until the completion of a project.” Not
surprisingly, a large majority of temporary help agency employees reported that they were on a temporary job.

20

We asked a similar, though not identical, set of questions in the RPCWS. Temporary
help agency workers on temporary jobs and on-call workers were asked the identical questions as
in the CWS. Workers who were self-employed as an independent contractor or a freelancer were
asked, “Would you prefer to work for someone else rather than being self-employed, an
independent contractor or a freelance worker?” The response set was either “yes” or “no.”
Table 8 provides a comparison of the 1995 and 2005 CWS and 2015 RPCWS data of
workers’ preferences concerning their work arrangement. We restricted both samples to workers
who worked in the survey reference week. (We were able to exactly replicate the published
CWS results without this restriction.) Because the questions and response set were close but not
identical, and the sample sizes for the RPCWS were small, the results should be taken as
suggestive. 21 This caveat aside, the general pattern found in the earlier 1995 and 2005 CWS
seems to hold. A large majority of temporary help agency employees on temporary jobs would
prefer a permanent job and almost half of on-call workers would prefer a job with regularly
scheduled hours.
The 1995 and 2005 CWS found that more than 80 percent of independent contractors and
freelancers preferred their work arrangement to working for someone else, and a similar
proportion responded likewise in the 2015 RPCWS. 22 It is possible that the CWS question
prompts independent contractors and freelancers to reflect on the advantages of being their own
boss, which elicits a favorable response, rather than the disadvantages of working fewer hours

21

The sample sizes for the 2015 RPCWS are 18 temporary help employees on temporary jobs, 57 on-call workers,
and 209 independent contractors and freelancers.

22

Recall that allowable responses were broader in the CWS (including refused and “it depends”). If we look at the
percent of independent contractors who said they would prefer to work for someone else, the figures were 9.8
percent in 1995, 8.8 percent in 2005 and 16.3 percent in 2015.

21

than workers in traditional employment relationships, which would elicit a less positive response.
The results in Table 8 suggest substantial stability over time in workers’ stated preferences
regarding their work arrangements, despite the significant growth in the share of workers in
alternative work arrangements over the last decade. More than 80 percent of independent
contractors and freelancers continue to indicate they prefer such an arrangement to being an
employee. 23 In contrast, the vast majority of those employed by temporary help agencies on
temporary jobs would prefer a permanent job, and almost half of on-call workers would rather
have regularly scheduled hours. Thus, it appears that many workers who become independent
contractors and freelancers are sorting into those work relationships based, in part, on their
preference for being their own boss, while many (and possibly most) workers in on-call and
temporary help jobs have a preference for more steady employment with regular hours.

X. Conclusion
Many possible factors could have contributed to the large increase in the incidence of
alternative work arrangements for American workers from 2005 to 2015 that we have
documented in this paper. Worker, or supply-side, factors include shifts in workforce
composition to groups with a greater preference for alternative work arrangements or increased
desire for workplace flexibility. Firm, or demand-side, factors include potential growing
efficiency gains to contracting out as well as increased rent shifting incentives. Although a fuller
evaluation will have to await further research, we provide an initial evaluation of some leading
explanations.
23

A higher share of independent contractors and freelancers whose characteristics place them in the highest
predicted wage quintiles preferred their arrangements over traditional employment, but upwards of 70 percent of
those predicted to be in the bottom two quintiles still expressed a preference for their arrangement over employment.

22

The first explanation is that alternative work is more common among older workers and more
highly educated workers, and the workforce has become older and more educated over time. A
shift-share analysis, however, indicates that shifts in the age and education distribution of the
workforce account for only about 10 percent of the increase in the percentage of workers
employed in alternative work arrangements from 2005 to 2015. 24 Other supply-side factors,
such as a possible increase in demand for flexible work hours (perhaps supported by the
increased availability of health insurance as a result of the Affordable Care Act) and increased
concerns about work-life balance may also have contributed (Mas and Pallais 2016). It is
unlikely that supply-side factors account for the lion’s share of the rise in alternative work
arrangements since the rise in employees who are hired out to other firms through contract firms
or temporary help agencies accounts for roughly half of the overall rise in the share of
employment in alternative work arrangements in the last decade.
Second, technological changes that lead to enhanced monitoring, standardize job tasks,
and make information on worker reputation more widely available may be leading to greater
disintermediation of job tasks. Coase’s (1937) classic explanation for the boundary of firms
rested on the minimization of transaction costs within firm-employee relationships.
Technological changes may be reducing the transaction costs associated with contracting out job
tasks, however, and thus supporting the disintermediation of work. Furthermore, improvements
in information technology and thicker markets for contractors increasingly mean large

24

Specifically, we divided the sample into 30 age-by-education cells. If we assign the fraction of workers in each
cell that was employed in an alternative work arrangement in 2005 based on the BLS CWS and allow the share of
workers in each cell to change according to the observed changes between the 2005 CPS and 2015 CPS, we predict
that the overall share in workers employed in alternative work arrangements would have risen by 0.5 percentage
point, compared with the 5.1 percentage point increase that was actually observed. We reach a similar conclusion
using the 2015 age-by-education distribution from the RPCWS.

23

organizations may reap efficiency gains and cost savings from hiring specialized contractors for
non-core activities (such as janitorial services, food services, information technology,
accounting, and legal services) rather than managing such activities in-house.
Third, fairness norms and morale considerations often motivate firms to share rents with
their employees and create wage compression pressures within firm boundaries. And fairness
considerations seem to apply much more to traditional incumbent employees than to new hires or
contractors (Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1986). Market and other forces leading to rising
educational wage differentials and rising wage inequality increase the costs to firms of wage
compression and of sharing rents with low-wage workers. Thus, rising wage inequality itself
may have increased incentives to contract out low-wage workers and to concentrate high- and
low-wage workers into different organizations. Abraham and Taylor (1996) argue that
contracting out is often sought because firms seek to restrict the pool of workers with whom
rents are shared, as well as to reduce the volatility of core employment. A rise in inter-firm
variability in profitability is thus consistent with a greater desire for contracting out to reduce
rent sharing (although increased contracting out could also have contributed to the rise in interfirm variability in profits). Growing product market volatility can increase contracting out since
layoffs of incumbent traditional employees who typically have an implicit promise of a longterm relationship appear to be costlier to a firm’s reputation as an employer than are changes in
the use of contractors (Halonen-Akatwijuka and Hart 2016).
Relatedly, Weil (2014) argues that competitive pressures have increased firm demands
for “flexibility” and are causing a “fissuring” of the workplace, with workers increasingly being
misclassified as contract employees and work being redefined to make greater use of contract
workers and independent contractors. Furthermore, Song, et al. (2016) find a rising correlation
24

of firm wage premiums with worker skills and worker wage fixed effects (the permanent wage
component that persists across employers). These patterns suggest that high-rent firms are
increasingly contracting out standardized and lower-wage work and restricting rent sharing to a
smaller core of highly compensated workers.
Finally, it is plausible that the dislocation caused by the Great Recession in 2007-2009
may have caused many workers to seek alternative work arrangements when traditional
employment was not available. To the extent this is the case then one might expect a return to a
lower percentage of workers employed in alternative work arrangements over time, as the effects
of the recession continue to fade.
Regardless of the explanation for the growth in alternative work, our findings indicate
that workers in alternative work arrangements earn considerably less per week than do regular
employees with similar characteristics and in similar occupations. The earnings gap derives
more from the fact that workers in alternative work arrangements work fewer hours per week
than from the gap in hourly earnings (with the possible exception of employees of temporary
help agencies). A larger share of alternative workers are involuntary part-time workers
compared with employees in traditional jobs, suggesting that many workers in alternative work
arrangements may be “hours constrained.” Not surprisingly in view of these findings, the
majority of temporary help agency workers and a near majority of on-call workers would prefer
permanent employment with regularly scheduled hours to their current employment
arrangements. A majority of workers who are independent contractors or freelancers, however,
apparently value the flexibility and independence that comes with being their own boss and
report that they would prefer to work for themselves rather than for someone else.

experience squared, industry, occupation, race, Hispanic ethnicity, and gender using 2005 CPS MORG.
1995 and 2005 CWS data are weighted using supplement weights. 2015 RPCWS data are weighted
using an alternative set of weights that accounts for both (1) the under-representation of the proportion of
workers and (2) the over-representation of the proportion of self-employed workers in the lower quintiles
of predicted log hourly wages relative to the October 2015 Current Population Survey.
