Three Current Account Balances: A “Semi-Structuralist” Interpretation
Menzie D. Chinn and Jaewoo Lee
NBER Working Paper No. 11853
December 2005
JEL No. F31, F41
ABSTRACT
Three large current account imbalances – one deficit (the United States) and two surpluses (Japan
and the Euro area) – are subjected to a minimalist structural interpretation. Though simple, this
interpretation enables us to assess how much of each of the imbalances require a real exchange rate
adjustment. According to the estimates, a large part of the U.S. current account deficit (nearly 2
percentage points of the 2004 deficit of 5½ percent of GDP) will undergo an adjustment process that
involves real depreciation in its exchange rate. For Japan, a little more than 1 percentage point (of
GDP) of the current account surplus is found to require an exchange rate movement (real
appreciation) as the surpluses adjust down. For the Euro area, less than half a percentage point of its
current account surplus is found to require an adjustment via real appreciation.

1. INTRODUCTION
There has been a vigorous debate regarding the origin and implications of the
current account imbalances that have become ever more prominent over the past couple
of years. With the debate showing no sign of abatement, now seems a good time to
impose a little “structure” upon the discussion. We say “a little” because in this paper, we
follow a middle road, aiming to avoid the amorphous argument over whether there is a
global savings glut or revived Bretton Woods arrangement, and at the same time provide
a differing perspective from those gleaned from the new generation of dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium (DSGE) models.
To provide a little context, consider the savings glut/investment drought
perspective most closely associated with Bernanke (2005).1 In his view, the US current
account deficit is the outcome of deficient savings in the U.S., excess savings relative to
investment in East Asia and Europe, and the relatively higher rate of return on U.S.
assets. Setting aside the dissonant fact that U.S. private sector savings in 2004 are much
like they were in 2000, the argument achieves some amorphousness by virtue of the fact
that “normal” – which is necessary to defining what is excess and what is deficient – is
never defined, except by virtue of arbitrarily selected reference periods.
On another front of the debate is the disagreement between the new generation of
macroeconomic models, epitomized by the Fed’s Sigma model and the IMF’s Global

Related papers include Clarida (2004, 2005) and Hubbard (2005). For an econometric
critique, see Chinn and Ito (2005). On a somewhat different but related note, Gourinchas
and Rey (2005) and Blanchard et al. (2005) both emphasized the role that the foreign
interest in the U.S. assets played in the current developments and prospects of the U.S.
current account deficit.

-2Economic Model.2 Both of these models typify an approach that incorporates enormous
amounts of structure and internal consistency. Yet, despite the common theoretical
ancestry of these models, they disagree substantially about the impact of fiscal policy on
the accumulation of external debt, as well as the impact of fiscal policy on the current
account. In part, these differences are driven by differences in the behavioral aspects of
the models, and in part driven by the differing assumptions used in conducting the
simulations.
Yet another view on the likely evolution of imbalances has been provided through
correlations viewed through the prism of event studies. Careful studies of this nature have
been conducted by Croke et al. (2005), Freund and Warnock (2005), and Galati and
Debelle (2005). They examine previous current account deficit reductions in developed
economies. While useful, the event study approach aggregates and averages the shocks
both within and across episodes.3
For these reasons, we believe that it would be a profitable enterprise to apply a
method that, in principle, can say something about the evolution of key current account
imbalances and real values of currencies. In this regard our approach can answer two
central questions. First, how “sustainable” is the U.S. current account deficit, in the sense
that it has a persistent component. Second, in the adjustment of the current account to its
long run value, how much must the dollar adjust.
2

Greenspan (2005) and Ferguson (2005) referred to simulations of this model in their
assessment of the origins of the U.S. current account deficit. See Erceg et al. (2005a,b).
For GEM, see Laxton et al. (2005).
3

There are also a set of time series models invoking threshold effects; see Clarida et al.
(2005).

-3It is important to note that the results of our approach can be interpreted in a
number of ways. Movements in the real exchange rate can be interpreted as consistent
with the traditional view of currency values inducing expenditure switching. But, for
those concerned with intellectual rigor, our approach is entirely consistent with the
Obstfeld and Rogoff (2004) approach, wherein exchange rate adjustment is jointly
determined with tradable goods consumption reduction. Whereas they assume an
exogenously imposed need for a reduction of the U.S. current account balance, we
quantify how much of the U.S. imbalance will be eliminated, and simultaneously, how
much the dollar will decline, given historically observed responses to shocks. Nor do we
consider our approach as a substitute for the DSGE simulation or the event study
approach. Rather, our study can be considered complementary to approaches that rely
upon cross-country evidence, in contrast to our purely time series methodology.
Without claiming full generality, this paper adopts a parsimonious method to
decompose shocks in a manner relevant to the current debate. The role of the exchange
rate being a point of contention, shocks are decomposed according to their long-run effect
on the real exchange rate. In particular, Lee and Chinn (2002) found that the shocks with
only temporary exchange rate effects brought about a negative correlation between the
current account and the real exchange rate—current account improves as the exchange
rate depreciates—while the shocks with permanent exchange rate effects did not
necessarily bring about such a negative correlation. Then, to the extent that some of the
current account deficit of the United States is driven by temporary shocks, its correction
will be accompanied by a depreciation in the real exchange rate.

-4Applying the framework to the current account imbalances of three largest
economies—a deficit in the United States and surpluses in Japan and the Euro area— we
find that a substantial part (nearly 2 percentage points of GDP) of the U.S. current
account deficit in 2003 and 2004 is attributable to shocks that have only temporary
effects on the real exchange rate. That is, the correction of that part of the U.S. current
account deficit will go hand in hand with a depreciation of the U.S. real exchange rate.
For Japan and the Euro area, a much smaller part of their current account surpluses in
2004 are found to be driven by temporary shocks.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses
conceptual framework of this note, and section III reports the estimation results. Section
IV discusses the implication on the forthcoming adjustment on the basis of historical
decomposition. Section V concludes.
2. ECONOMETRIC FRAMEWORK
To explore the role of the exchange rate in the recent developments in the current
account, we employ a statistical methodology to decompose the source of current account
developments according to their long-term effect on the real exchange rate.
Macroeconomic shocks that sway current account balances will also affect the real
exchange rate. Some will have long-run effects while others have only temporary effects.
As will be shown in this section, the shocks that have only temporary effects on the real
exchange rate are exactly what motivate the widely held perception that exchange rate
depreciates over the medium term when the current account deteriorates (a perception
that is accurate).

-5We decompose shocks into two types by adopting the econometric identification
scheme of Blanchard and Quah (1989). One of the two fundamental shocks is postulated
to have no long-term effect on the real exchange rate. The methodology can be
summarized by the following bi-variate VAR, estimated for the current account ( cat ) and
the first-differenced real exchange rate ( ∆qt ).
⎡ε tT ⎤
⎡ cat ⎤
⎡ cat ⎤ ⎡ηtca ⎤
⎡ cat ⎤
⎢ ∆q ⎥ = B ( L) ⎢ ∆q ⎥ + ⎢ q ⎥ = B ( L) ⎢ ∆q ⎥ + B(0) ⎢ P ⎥ ,
⎣ t⎦
⎣ t ⎦ ⎣ ηt ⎦
⎣ t⎦
⎣ε t ⎦

(1)

where country-specific temporary shocks are denoted as ε tT , and permanent shocks as

ε tP . When ε t denotes the vector of temporary and permanent shocks, the following
standard assumptions are made: E (ε t ) = 0 , E (ε t ε t′ ) = I , and E (ε t ε s′ ) = 0 when t ≠ s .

In a conventional VAR analysis, system (1) will be identified by assuming that

B(0) is a lower triangular matrix. It amounts to assuming that the real exchange rate
innovation has no contemporaneous effect on the current account, an assumption that is at
odds with many theoretical models.
In contrast, the Blanchard and Quah approach enables one to identify the system
on the basis of a criterion that is consistent with a wide spectrum of intertemporal open
macro models. It is assumed that temporary shocks have no long-run effect on the
exchange rate, regardless of other characteristics of underlying shocks. Unlike the
identification obtained by Choleski factorization that assumes a lower triangular B(0) ,
the temporary and permanent shocks identified here should not necessarily be interpreted
as shocks to the exchange rate and current account, respectively. Estimated innovations to

-6the exchange rate and current account (ηt ) are both linear combinations of temporary and
permanent shocks, because the off-diagonal elements of matrix B(0) are non-zero.
In an earlier paper examining the G7 countries, we found that the temporary and
permanent shocks carry different relative importance for current account balances and
exchange rates, and moreover that they induce different correlations between current
account balances and exchange rates. In response to a temporary shock, the current
account balance improves when the real exchange rate depreciates. In response to a
permanent shock, however, the current account balance improves at the same time as the
real exchange rate appreciates. This has clear implications for the current debate on the
role of the exchange rate. To the extent that today’s current account imbalances are
caused by temporary shocks, a real dollar depreciation is imminent.

3. DATA AND ESTIMATION RESULTS
3.1 Data

The current account and real exchange rate data are largely drawn from the
International Financial Statistics database, at the quarterly frequency, except for the
seasonally adjusted U.S. current account that was obtained from the BEA. For all three
economies, the real effective exchange rates (based on CPI) are available since the first
quarter of 1980. The current account data are available until 2004 for the United States
and the Euro area and until 2003Q3 for Japan. The U.S. current account balances were
adjusted for the Gulf War transfers of the early 1990s. In the econometric estimation, the
current account balance is measured as the ratio of its dollar value to the dollar-

-7denominated nominal GDP. The real exchange rate is the first-differenced log of the real
effective exchange rate index based on the consumer price index.4
3.2 Estimating the VAR and Impulse Responses

The VAR system was estimated with two lags for all three economies, based on
standard criteria (Akaike information criterion and Schwartz criterion). However, a
shorter sample ending in 2001Q4 was used for the United States, to avoid the post-2001
period which suggests a substantial change in econometric relationship. Starting in
2002Q1, the real effective exchange rate of the United States began to depreciate, while
its current account deficit also kept on rising. The estimation over the full sample resulted
in impulse response functions that were opposite to those obtained for the U.S. using any
sample period that excludes 2004, and opposite to those obtained for other economies
with any sample period (typical impulse responses are discussed in the next paragraph).5
Though not a rigorous test, we view this result as suggesting an anomaly in the external
developments of the U.S. in recent years. Consequently, we used data preceding this
period.
Estimation results are reported in Table 1. In general they accord with one’s
priors. It is more difficult to explain movements in real exchange rates than in current
account balances. The R 2 ’s for the exchange rate change equations range from 0.10 to
0.13, while those for the current account balance take on values from 0.72 to 0.94. First

Greater detail is contained in the Data Appendix.

While the econometric results are sensitive to the inclusion of the 2004 data for the
U.S., the results for Japan and the Euro area are little affected as the end point of the
sample is varied from 2002 to 2004.

-8differences of the real exchange rate exhibit some serial correlation, with the coefficient
on the lagged difference ranging from 0.22 to 0.31. In contrast, the current account
balance exhibits substantial persistence, with the coefficient on the first lag taking on
values as high as 0.87(for the United States).
Applying structural decomposition to examine the effects of two different types of
shocks, temporary versus permanent shocks are found to bring about opposite
correlations between the real exchange rate and the current account. The impulseresponses in Figures 1 to 3 show that for all three economies, a real depreciation
accompanies an improvement in the current account under the temporary shocks. This
corresponds to the oft-mentioned expenditure-switching effect on the current account of
exchange rate changes. In contrast, for permanent shocks, a real appreciation goes hand
in hand with an improvement in the current account, contradicting conventional wisdom
regarding the current account balance - exchange rate relationship. It should emphasized
that the identification criterion for temporary and permanent shocks impose no a priori
restrictions on the signs of these correlations.
The economic interpretation of the permanent and temporary shocks, discussed
further in our previous paper (Lee and Chinn, 2002), can be summarized as follows.
Temporary shocks find an easy candidate in monetary shocks. These are often viewed as
having only a temporary effects on the real exchange rate, excepting long run net-wealth
effects which are quantitatively tiny. Permanent shocks are more difficult to pin down.
Typically, permanent shocks are associated with productivity innovations; however, this
is often thought of as inducing a negative correlation between the current account and the
exchange rate. We prefer the interpretation of the permanent shock as a preference shock

-9in favor of home exports, which would have a long-run effect on the real exchange rate,
while inducing a positive comovement between the current account and the real exchange
rate.6 It might be more useful to think of a negative value of this shock – a shock against
home exports. One could interpret a “surprise” in government spending as a sort of
negative preference shock, since government spending is likely to divert exportables back
to home consumption.
Regardless of their economic interpretation, what matters foremost for our current
purpose is the existence of these two types of shocks and the different correlations
between the current account and the exchange rate induced by these two shocks. It is the
temporary shocks that induce the usual negative correlation between the current account
and the real exchange rate.
How do these estimated impulse response functions compare to our previous
estimates? Since for the sample has changed somewhat – it is expanded by up to four
years – one might expect some changes. For the U.S. and Japan, the changes are
relatively minor. For the euro area that was not analyzed in our previous study, we
compare it with the previous results for several member countries. We find the temporary
component has an initial impact on the current account about three times as large as it did
for Germany, but only about twice as large as for Italy. The impact of the permanent
component is about the same as in Germany or France.

6

Abstracting away from temporary shocks, Blanchard et al. (2005) provides an analysis
of preference shocks that have permanent effects on the real exchange rate. Consistent
with our interpretation, a preference shock in favor of foreign exports generates a real
depreciation and current account deficit along the adjustment path.

4. HISTORY AND PROSPECTS

Given the estimates of the structural matrix— B(0) matrix in equation (1)—the
estimated shocks to the current account and the real exchange rates can be decomposed
into temporary and permanent shocks. By tracking their effects using the estimated
coefficients, we can uncover the contribution of temporary and permanent shocks to the
past movements in the current account and the real exchange rate. Subject to the initial
conditions, which are the prevailing values of the current account and the real exchange
rate at the beginning of the sample (in 1980), this historical decomposition brings to light
how much of the current account imbalances are attributable to temporary and permanent
shocks.
One thing we know about the current account imbalance due to temporary shocks
is that its adjustment (e.g. improvement in the case of the United States) will entail a
movement in the real exchange rate in the opposite direction (thus a real U.S. dollar
depreciation). The same temporary shocks will reverse its own effect on the exchange
rate, for they have no permanent effects on the real exchange rate. That is, the portion of
the current account due to temporary shocks is the amount of current account imbalance
that will be corrected through a real exchange rate adjustment in the direction consistent
with the conventional wisdom.
Permanent shocks, on the other hand, do not lead to a usual comovement in the
current account and the exchange rate. Given the stationary nature of the current account,
the effect of permanent shocks to the current account will decay over time. But this

- 11 process will not be accompanied by a movement in the exchange rate in any particular
direction, because the permanent shocks will have a lasting effect on the exchange rate
and no further adjustment in a particular direction is necessary.
The historical decomposition of the U.S. current account and the real exchange
rate is presented in Figure 4. The upper panel shows the current account in percent of
GDP since 1983, the portion attributable to the initial values and deterministic factors
(constant terms in the estimated VAR), and the portion attributable to these and
permanent shocks (named “non-transitory component”). The lower panel shows the real
exchange rate index and the portion attributable to comparable sources of shocks—
permanent shocks, deterministic factors, and initial values.
The role of temporary shocks in the current account deficit and the exchange rate
is strikingly large in the United States. Almost a half of the current account deficit since
2000 is attributed to temporary shocks, suggesting that its correction will entail a
depreciation in the real exchange rate. After the correction of the deficit due to temporary
shocks, there still remains a small deficit due to permanent shocks. This deficit will also
decline, to bring the current account close to the deterministic part, but without
necessarily involving exchange rate adjustment.
Turning to the exchange rate, a large gap opened between the actual exchange rate
and its long-term component during the last several years. The gap had peaked in 2002
and has since narrowed slightly. Nevertheless, in 2004, a gap of more than 10 percent
exists between the actual real exchange rate and its long-term component driven by nontransitory shocks. While the real depreciation of the past two years has brought the value

- 12 of the U.S. dollar down close to its 1997-98 value -- when the actual rate matched the
long-term component of the exchange rate -- the long-term component itself has declined
further since then, so that the gap between the actual and long run equilibrium has
remained largely unchanged.
How do these results relate to the ongoing debate? First, the exchange rate result
has something of the flavor of the Permanent Equilibrium Exchange Rate concept, in
which the permanent component is extracted by virtue of a transitory-permanent
decomposition; however, in this case, the decomposition is bivariate in nature.7 Thus, in
the sense of deviating from an “equilibrium value”, the dollar remains overvalued.
The non-transitory component also seems quite large in absolute value, at -4.14
percent of GDP compared to a recorded value for 2004 of -5.68 percent of GDP. What
this indicates is that exchange rate depreciation associated with the conventional
adjustment process will not return the current account deficit to something less than 4
percent of GDP by itself. A further reduction of the current account deficit will follow as
the effect of permanent shocks on the current account wanes. That part of adjustment,
however, does not necessarily involve a further exchange rate realignment, according to
the impulse-response analysis discussed earlier.
The question of how far the current account deficit will decline can be answered
by our estimate of the deterministic component of the current account – essentially that
part of the historical decomposition arising from initial values and estimated constants in

7

A closely related approach is in MacDonald and Swagel (2000). See the discussion in
Driver and Westaway (2004).

- 13 the VARs. The estimate suggests that current account deficit will decline to about 3.0
percent of GDP when various shocks work their ways out. This answer can also inform
the debate regarding the “sustainable current account.” Here, we take the view that a
current account deficit of about 3.0 percent is “sustainable” in the sense that – based upon
historical correlations – the deficit will revert to this value.
This conclusion may be surprising to those who believe that that a zero current
account deficit must be achieved eventually. However, it is important to note that, with
the economy growing over the long term, a negative current account balance and stable
debt to GDP ratio are compatible. Furthermore, given the fact that the United States has
earned more on its assets abroad than foreigners have earned on the assets they own in
the U.S., there is extra “wiggle room” for running a deficit. Kouparitsas (2005) has
calculated the sustainable net exports deficit at 1.4 percent of GDP. Different
assumptions lead to slightly higher numbers (although none are near a current account
deficit of 6 percent of GDP, which is predicted for 2005).8
For Japan and the Euro area, a large part of the short-run movement in the current
account is attributed to temporary shocks while the big medium-term swings in the
current account appear to be driven by permanent shocks. In both economies, temporary
components account for a small part of current account surpluses in 2004. The correction
of these temporary-shock-driven surpluses will entail some appreciation in their real
exchange rates. Interestingly, however, the magnitude of the implied appreciations is
quite small.
8

IMF (2005) forecasts 6.1%, while the Economist (October 1-7, 2005) survey of
economists indicates 6.3%.

- 14 This reading is confirmed by the lower-panel figures of the exchange rate. While
the bulk of the exchange rate movement in both Japan and the Euro area is attributed to
permanent shocks, temporary shocks are found to have played a bigger role in the
movement of Japan’s real exchange rate over the past two years. Without the contribution
of temporary shocks, the real value of the yen would have been higher than its observed
value.

5. CONCLUSION

Speculation abounds on the likely path of the U.S. exchange rate, given the
unprecedented magnitude of the current account deficit. In the discussion of “global
rebalancing”, the potential counterparts in the adjustment of the U.S. current account
deficit, the surpluses of two largest economies (Japan and the Euro area) have also
attracted much attention. In this paper, we have attempted to impose some structure upon
the discussion of what is a normal current account and exchange rate level, for the three
key economies.
By applying a simple identification criterion that decomposes the shocks to those
that do not have a long-run effect on the real exchange rate (termed temporary shocks)
and those that do (termed permanent shocks), the portion of the current account that will
adjust via the conventional real exchange rate channel was estimated. The U.S. current
account imbalances recorded for 2004 predict a further dollar decline of nearly 20
percent, conditional upon the shocks already observed. Hence, despite the dollar’s decline
since 2002, the U.S. currency appears destined for a further real depreciation, although

- 15 interestingly, the total decline is less than estimates obtained in other studies (e.g.,
Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2004). In a striking contrast, an appreciation of a much smaller
magnitude is anticipated for Japan and the Euro area. This might reflect the fact that a
large part of the U.S. current account deficit is incurred vis-à-vis the other countries not
included in our analysis.
Obviously, what we have recounted above should not be construed as forecasts of
the current account or the exchange rate of these three economies. This is because the
projections into the future are conditional upon the shocks already observed (and recall,
by definition the shocks are unpredictable). In addition, it is important to recall that our
estimates of the non-transitory components of the current account and the exchange rate
are merely estimates–and that considerable uncertainty circumscribes each of these
estimates.
Interestingly, those who argue that the past three years of U.S. economic behavior
has been aberrant would find confirmation in our results, as we were unable to model the
2002-04 period in a satisfactory manner. We are agnostic on whether this has been
caused by a “global savings glut”. However, to the extent that we are able to model the
U.S. current account balance and dollar behavior over the period up to end-2001, we do
not view this phenomenon as one that has explained the current account deficit over the
entire post-East Asian crisis period. Rather it appears to be of fairly recent origin, and
hence may prove less durable than some commentators have conjectured.
Finally, we note two limitations of the analysis we have undertaken. The first
limitation is that we do not allow for interactions between the economies, at least directly.

- 16 The statistical analysis of the U.S. economy was conducted implicitly viewing the world
through a two-country model; then the process was repeated for Japan and the Euro area.
A second, and more important, limitation is that the analysis is predicated upon
the future looking like the past. Yet, by virtue of the sheer absolute magnitude of presentday imbalances, we are in uncharted territory. Of course, that is a limitation shared by all
the modes of analysis currently being used.

Data Appendix

Real Exchange Rates: CPI deflated trade weighed indices (series rec), drawn from IMF,
International Financial Statistics. See Bayoumi, Lee and Jayanthi (2005) for description
of index characteristics.

Current account balances: Dollar amounts, drawn from IMF, International Financial
Statistics, for U.S and Japan. The U.S. current account balance is obtained from the BEA
and adjusted to omit the effect of Gulf War transfers, using figures reported in various
issues of Bureau of Economic Analysis’s Survey of Current Business. The euro area
current account balance in euro is drawn from the Area Wide Model (AWM) database
described in Fagan et al. (2001), located on the Euro Area Business Cycle Network
website (http://www.eabcn.org/data/awm/index.htm). In all cases, current account
balances are normalized by GDP.
