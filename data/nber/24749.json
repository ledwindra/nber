    "abstract": "\n\nWe study a Chinese policy that awards substantial tax cuts to \ufb01rms with R&D investment over a threshold or \u201cnotch.\u201d Quasi-experimental variation and administrative tax data show a signi\ufb01cant increase in reported R&D that is partly driven by \ufb01rms relabeling expenses as R&D. Structural estimates show relabeling accounts for 24.2% of reported R&D and that productivity increases by 9% when real R&D doubles. Policy simulations show \ufb01rm selection and relabeling determine the cost-e\ufb00ectiveness of stimulating R&D, that notch-based policies are more e\ufb00ective than tax credits when relabeling is prevalent, and that modest spillovers justify the program from a welfare perspective.\n\n",
