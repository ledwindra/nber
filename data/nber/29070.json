    "abstract": "\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many low- and middle-income countries, causing widespread food insecurity and a sharp decline in living standards. In response to this crisis, governments and humanitarian organizations worldwide have distributed social assistance to over 1.5 billion people. Targeting is a central challenge in administering these programs: given available data, how does one rapidly identify those with the greatest need? Here we show that data from mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of humanitarian assistance. Our approach uses traditional survey data to train machine-learning algorithms to recognize patterns of poverty in mobile phone data; the trained algorithms can then prioritize aid to the poorest mobile subscribers. We evaluate this approach by studying Togo\u2019s flagship emergency cash transfer program, which used these algorithms to disburse millions of dollars in COVID-19 relief aid. Our analysis compares outcomes \u2013 including exclusion errors, total social welfare, and measures of fairness \u2013 under different targeting regimes. Relative to the geographic targeting options considered by the Government of Togo, the machine learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4-21%. Relative to methods requiring a comprehensive social registry (a hypothetical exercise; no such registry exists in Togo), the machine learning approach increases exclusion errors by 9-35%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to complement traditional methods for targeting humanitarian assistance, particularly in crisis settings when traditional data are missing or out of date.\n\n",
