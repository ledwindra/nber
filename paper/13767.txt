JEL No. H2,I1
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we estimate the effect of the tax preference for health insurance on health care spending
using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys from 1996-2005. We use the fact that Social
Security taxes are only levied on earnings below a statutory threshold to identify the impact of the
tax preference. Because employer-sponsored health insurance premiums are excluded from Social
Security payroll taxes, workers who earn just below the Social Security tax threshold receive a larger
tax preference for health insurance than workers who earn just above it. We find a significant effect
of the tax preference, consistent with previous research.

I. INTRODUCTION
The tax preference for employer-sponsored health insurance, under which
employer contributions to employee health insurance are deductible to the employer and
non-taxable to the employee, is perhaps the most salient feature of postwar health policy
in the United States. By making insured health spending appear less costly than it is, the
tax preference gives employees the incentive to take compensation as health insurance
rather than cash. This incentive has had two main effects. First, it has increased
insurance coverage, particularly coverage through employers (see Jonathan Gruber, 2002,
for a review of work identifying this effect). Second, it has distorted the quantity and
type of health insurance that people choose in a manner that has increased health
spending. At the most basic level, the tax preference increases demand for health
services by reducing their price relative to other goods and services. The tax preference
also induces people to channel their spending on health services through insurance rather
than spend out of pocket. This tax bias favoring the purchase of health insurance leads
people to choose health plans with lower deductibles and coinsurance rates, which in turn
further increases spending because of the moral hazard inherent in health insurance.1
Although economists differ about the consequences for social welfare of the effect of the
tax preference on coverage, virtually all since Martin Feldstein's (1973) seminal article
have agreed that the overspending on health care induced by the tax preference has
contributed to the inefficiency of the U.S. health system.
1

Even though individuals' health plan choices are mediated through employers, there are several reasons to
expect a link between an individual's tax rate and his plan's generosity. First, most individuals with
employer-sponsored health insurance are offered a choice of health plan. According to the Kaiser Family
Foundation/Health Research and Educational Trust (2005), 67 percent of workers in 1996 and 63 percent in
2005 could choose from at least two plans. Second, even employers that offer only one plan choose its
parameters based on their workers' preferences. In particular, M. Kate Bundorf (2002) shows that worker
characteristics, including income (and therefore tax rate), are statistically significant determinants of plan
generosity.

2

Assessments of the magnitude of the effect of the tax preference on health
spending have therefore been at the center of health policy debates for more than 30
years. Yet, for two reasons, few studies have convincingly identified the size of this
effect. First, because tax rates depend on income, and income and health spending are
jointly determined outcomes of an incompletely observable process, disentangling the
effect of the tax preference from other, unobserved determinants of income is difficult.
Second, because researchers only observe imperfectly measured proxies for the true posttax price for insurance, simple regression estimates of the effect of the tax preference are
biased toward zero.
In this paper, we use the fact that Social Security taxes are only levied on earnings
below a statutory threshold to identify the tax preference’s impact. Because employersponsored health insurance premiums are excluded from Social Security payroll taxes,
workers who earn just below the Social Security tax threshold receive a larger tax
preference for health insurance than workers who earn just above it. By comparing
health care spending of individuals in families with workers just above the payroll tax
threshold with that of individuals in families with workers who are just below it, we can
identify the effect of the tax preference for insurance.
Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys Household Component
(MEPS-HC) from 1996-2005, we estimate a significant impact of the tax preference for
insurance on health spending, consistent with results in the previous literature. The paper
proceeds in the next five sections. Section II reviews previous work concerned with
estimating the effect of tax policy on health spending and describes our methodological
approach. Section III discusses the data we use for our analysis, and presents tabular

3

results which show evidence of a large impact of the Social Security payroll tax on health
care spending. People in families with a holder of employer-sponsored insurance who
earns just above the tax threshold spend 24 percent less than people in families with an
employer-sponsored-insurance policyholder who earns just below the tax threshold.
Section IV imbeds the payroll tax in a more general framework for analyzing the impact
of tax policy on health care spending and provides an estimate of the tax preference’s
effect. Section V uses data from the Community Tracking Study from 1996-1998 to
investigate the mechanism through which this effect occurs. We find that holders of
employer-sponsored health insurance who earn just above the tax threshold have lower
premiums, and thus presumably less extensive health insurance coverage, than those who
earn just below it. Section VI makes some concluding observations.

II. EFFECTS OF TAX PREFERENCES ON HEALTH SPENDING: PREVIOUS
RESEARCH
As Mark Pauly's (1986) classic review highlights, conventional estimates of the
effects of tax policy on health spending suffer from two sources of potential bias. First,
because marginal tax rates rise with income, and individuals’ incomes and health
spending are jointly determined by an endogenous process, simple regression estimates of
the effect of the tax rate on spending are in general biased and inconsistent. Second,
because researchers only observe proxies for the after-tax price of insurance, and these
proxies measure the true after-tax price with error, estimates of the effect of the tax rate
are biased toward zero. As Pauly points out, these problems are of more than theoretical
concern. The wide range of early estimates of the elasticity reported by Pauly, -0.14 to -

4

1.9, reflect the failure of traditional approaches to deal robustly with these sources of
bias.
More recent research has taken two novel approaches to address this shortcoming.
One arm of this research uses theoretical models to simulate the effects of tax policy
based on existing empirical estimates of the price elasticity of demand for health
services.2 William Jack and Louise Sheiner (1997) use this parameter as an input to a
theoretical model in which consumers choose insurance contracts and then face random
health shocks. They calculate how much health spending would be reduced by repeal of
the tax preference under various assumptions about individuals' coefficient of relative
risk aversion. They also propose conditions under which extending the tax preference to
out-of-pocket spending can actually reduce health spending.3 Jonathan Gruber (2002)
uses a simulation model that highlights the role of firms' offering decisions to show how
spending and employer coverage would change in response to complete and partial repeal
of the tax preference. John Cogan, Glenn Hubbard, and Daniel Kessler (2011) show that
the effect of the tax preference for insurance on health spending can be written as the
product of two parameters: the price elasticity of demand for health services, and the

2

The most comprehensive study of the elasticity of demand for health services remains the RAND Health
Insurance Experiment, which found that a one percent increase in the out-of-pocket price led to a 0.2
percent decline in spending (Willard Manning, et al., 1987; Joseph Newhouse, 1993). In a more recent
study using observational data, Matthew Eichner (1998) found that a one percent increase in the price led to
approximately a 0.7 percent decline in spending.
3
Expanding deductibility has two opposing effects on health care spending. First, it lowers the overall price
of health care relative to other goods and services, thereby increasing health care spending. Second, it raises
the price of purchasing health care through insurance relative to out-of-pocket. The second effect induces
people to shift to health plans with higher deductibles and coinsurance rates which, in turn, lowers health
care spending. Because the base of out-of-pocket spending is so much smaller than that of insured
spending, the net change in the overall price of health care from expanding deductibility is much smaller
than the change in the relative price of out-of-pocket versus insured care. This fact leads the second effect
to dominate the first and, in turn, leads to a net decrease in spending.

effect of the tax preference on the coinsurance rate. 4 They use the simulation results
from Jack and Sheiner (1997) and Martin Feldstein and Bernard Friedman (1977), along
with empirical estimates of the price elasticity of demand, to provide a range of estimates
of the effect of repealing the tax preference.
A second arm of this research seeks to identify the effects of tax policy
empirically using arguably exogenous variation in the tax rate.5 Jonathan Gruber and
Michael Lettau (2004) estimate the effect of the tax preference using simulated tax rates
as instruments for people's actual tax rates, where the simulated tax rates are functions
only of interactions between state, year, and an individual's decile in the earnings
distribution. They find an elasticity of firm-level insurance spending with respect to the
after-tax price of -0.7. Michael Smart and Mark Stabile (2005) examine the
consequences of the Canadian Medical Expense Tax Credit (CMETC), which allows
taxpayers to claim a credit for 17 percent of medical expenses in excess of $1,637 (2000
tax year) or 3 percent of net income, whichever is smaller. Qualifying expenses include
both insurance premiums and out-of-pocket spending on hospital and physician services,
prescription drugs, and long-term care. Using discontinuities in the CMETC formula,
and variations in the effective formula across provinces and over time, they find moderate
to large tax-price elasticities of demand for health services, between -0.7 and -1.0.
Each of these studies has important limitations. The consistency of Gruber and
Lettau's (2004) estimates depend on the validity of their assumption that interactions

4

For simplicity, we use the term "coinsurance rate" to refer to all cost-sharing -- that is, payments made
under an insurance policy's deductible and its copayment schedule.
5
A related set of studies examine the effect of tax policy on firms' decision to offer insurance, employees
decision to take up insurance, and insurance plan choice (Jonathan Gruber and Ebonya Washington, 2005;
William Jack, Arik Levinson, and Sjamsu Rahardja, 2006). These studies find small elasticities of offer
and takeup, but larger elasticities of plan choice, with respect to the tax preference.

between state tax progressivity and individuals' incomes are uncorrelated with
individuals' taste for health insurance or medical care. Smart and Stabile's approach
requires a similar assumption, and in any event may not be applicable to the effect of the
tax preference on health spending in the United States. On the one hand, the CMETC
only applies to spending on products and services that are not already covered by publicly
financed basic provincial health insurance. Because uncovered services may be more
discretionary in nature, their elasticity of spending may be larger than the elasticity of
spending on all health care. On the other hand, the CMETC applies to both insured and
out-of-pocket spending, while the tax preference in the U.S. applies only to insured
spending. Thus, the U.S. tax preference would tend to induce people to shift to health
insurance plans with less coinsurance, whereas the CMETC would not.6 This effect, in
turn, would increase moral hazard and increase health spending, which implies that the
elasticity of spending with respect to the CMETC would be smaller than the elasticity of
spending with respect to a tax preference for insurance.
As Gruber and Lettau (2004) point out, their estimated elasticities, as well as
those of Smart and Stabile (2005), imply that repeal of the tax preference would lead to
very large reductions in spending on employer-sponsored insurance. Accurate
assessment of the effect of the tax preference is therefore a critical tax policy issue. In
this paper, we offer an alternative strategy for identifying the effect of interest. We use
the fact the Social Security program limits the annual amount of wage earnings that are
subject to Social Security payroll taxation. Under the Social Security program,
employers and employees each pay a 6.2 percent payroll tax on earnings below the

6

Smart and Stabile show that, in practice, the CMETC does not affect the demand for insurance on the
intensive margin.

7

maximum taxable wage (the "wage base"). The wage base is set by law and is
automatically adjusted each year by the average growth in Social-Security covered
wages. (Table 1 reports the wage base for each of our sample years 1996-2005.) For
workers who earn below the wage base, earnings are subject to Social Security payroll
taxes while employer-sponsored health insurance premiums are not; above the wage base,
neither earnings nor premiums are subject to tax..
This differential tax treatment of earnings creates a differential tax preference for
insurance. Following Gruber and Lettau (2004), we specify the tax price of insurance,
TP, as

TP 

(1     ss   mc ) 7
,
(1   ss   mc )

where τ is the marginal federal income tax rate, τss is the Social Security tax rate, and τmc
is the Medicare tax rate. Thus, for workers who earn below the wage base, the tax price
of insurance is
TP 

(1     ss   mc )
,
(1   ss   mc )

but for those above the wage base, the tax price is

TP 

(1     mc )
.
(1   mc )

In principle, by comparing health care spending of individuals in families with a
employer-sponsored insurance policyholder who earns just below the maximum taxable
wage to spending by individuals with a policyholder who earns just above this threshold,
we can identify the impact of the tax preference on health care spending.
7

We compute the marginal federal tax rate by assuming each family takes the standard deduction. We
cannot compute the state tax rates because the MEPS does not have information on the state of residence.

III. DATA

We use data from the MEPS-HC from 1996-2005. The MEPS-HC collects data
from a sample of families and individuals that is drawn from a nationally representative
subsample of households that participate in the National Health Interview Survey. The
panel design of the MEPS seeks to collect information on each individual in the sample
for two full calendar years. In particular, the MEPS-HC collects the amount of spending
on health care services, wage earnings, and various demographic and economic
information. The MEPS-HC (through the person-round-plan file) also links each
individual with employer-sponsored health insurance to the worker who holds the policy
that is the source of coverage. We limit our main analysis to individuals covered all year
through the same full-year worker who holds a full-year employer-sponsored health
insurance policy. Since in any given year only about 15 percent of all workers have
earnings that exceed Social Security’s maximum taxable wage, our sample pools together
ten years of annual MEPS samples to obtain as many observations on high-wage workers
as possible.

A. Results Using Sample Means

Because health care is a normal good, we expect, all else held constant, that health
care spending would rise with wages. But if the tax preference provided by the Social
Security payroll tax significantly affects health care spending, its impact should be
manifested in lower health care spending among individuals in families in which the
policyholder earns just above the payroll tax threshold relative to individuals in families
in which the policyholder earns just below the threshold. Thus, if we array individuals

9

according to the earnings of their family's policyholder, we would expect to observe a
monotonic relationship between earnings and health care spending across the earnings
spectrum, except around the Social Security payroll tax threshold.
Table 2 groups individuals in the 1996-2005 pooled MEPS by the earnings of
their family's policyholder, expressed as a percentage of the Social Security wage base in
their sample year. The table reports the average health care spending level (in constant
2004 dollars, deflated with the CPI) of all individuals within each wage interval. As the
table shows, health care spending generally rises with the earnings level of the family’s
policyholder. Individuals in families with a policyholder earning less than 70 percent of
the Social Security wage base spend on average $1,953 per year in 2004 dollars. As the
wage and salary income of a family's policyholder increases, so does each member's
health spending, up to 90-100 percent of the wage base ($2,406 per year).
However, individuals in families with a policyholder earning 100-110 percent of
the wage base spend 23.7 percent less on average -- $1,836 per year -- than their
counterparts in families with a policyholder earning 90-100 percent of the wage base.
Given that the tax price of health insurance rises from 0.597 below to 0.692 above the
wage base (see Table 3), this implies a raw elasticity of -1.823,8 which is highly
suggestive of a large impact of the payroll tax preference on health care spending. The
fact that as the wage and salary income of a family's policyholder increases beyond 100110 percent of the wage base, health spending begins rising again, to $2,110 for persons
in families in which the policyholder earns more than 130 percent of the taxable
threshold, lends further support to the hypothesis that the drop in health care spending
just above the Social Security tax threshold is the result of the tax preference.
8

-1.823 = [(1836 - 2406) / (0.5*(1836 + 2406))] / [(0.692 - 0.597) / (0.5*(0.692 + 0.597))].

10

Table 3 shows that differences in the characteristics of individuals and families
are unlikely to account for the differences in spending. The table compares the
characteristics from families in which the policyholder earns 90-100 percent of the Social
Security taxable wage threshold to the characteristics from families in which the
policyholder earns 100-110 percent of the threshold. As the table shows, the
characteristics are quite similar, except for their tax price of insurance. Individuals in the
higher-income group come from families with only slightly more educated policyholders
(15.3 years, as opposed to 15.1 years). The occupation, industry, age, gender, and marital
status distributions show no systematic differences that would explain the observed
differences in health care spending between the two groups.
The total income of families whose policyholder earns just below the taxable
earnings threshold is 8.0 percent ($8,130) lower than family incomes whose policyholder
earns just above the threshold. This difference is not surprising, but, importantly, rules
out the likelihood that higher family incomes among families in the lower wage group
generated by non-wage sources or other family member earnings explain their higher
health care spending levels.
Figure 1 presents two breakdowns of the difference in spending between
individuals in families with a policyholder just above and just below the Social Security
tax threshold. The top panel of the figure shows that individuals in families in which a
policyholder earns 90-100 percent of the wage base spend more on both inpatient and
outpatient services (although not on outpatient dental and vision services, which are
traditionally not covered by insurance) than individuals in families with a policyholder
earning 100-110 percent of the wage base. The bottom panel shows average spending by

11

wage income quintile, again for individuals in families with a policyholder earning 90100 versus 100-110 percent of the wage base. It shows that spending is higher in every
quintile among those below versus above the wage base, statistically significantly higher
for quintiles 1, 3, 4, and 5 (p < 0.01 for quintiles 1, 3, and 5, p = 0.03 for quintile 4). The
difference in spending is most pronounced among individuals in the top quintile: those
just below the wage base spent $8,973 on average as compared to those just above the
wage base, who spent $6,442.

IV. ESTIMATING THE LINK BETWEEN TAX PREFERENCES AND HEALTH
SPENDING

Although these results are suggestive, they do not formally control for differences
in individuals and families that may affect both tax rates and health spending. To do so,
we specify a model of the health spending of individuals i = 1,…, N covered by full-year
employer-sponsored health insurance in year t. Each individual is a member of a family j
= 1,…, J that consists of a policyholder who works outside the home for wages or salary,
and that person's spouse and/or children, if s/he has them. An individual has
characteristics Xijt that include age, age squared, gender, and marital status. A family has
characteristics Zjt that include the number of covered family members and the educational
attainment, occupation, and industry of the policyholder. Educational attainment is an
indicator variable denoting whether the policyholder is a college graduate; occupation is
an indicator variable for whether the policyholder is a professional or technical worker
(all other occupations are the omitted group); industry is a series of indicator variables for
whether the policyholder is employed in agriculture or mining, construction,

12

manufacturing, financial and business services, or public administration (all other
industries are the omitted group). Finally, we characterize each family by its total income
Yjt and the wage and salary income of its policyholder Wjt.

A. Models

Our models specify health spending Hijt as a function of the characteristics of
individuals and families, Xijt and Zjt; a function of family income and the wage and salary
of the family's policyholder, g(Yjt,Wjt); the tax price of insurance TPjt; a family-specific
error term ηj;9 and an individual-specific error term εijt:
(1)

Hijt = θt + λTPjt + Xijtβ + Zjtγ + g(Yjt,Wjt) + ηj + εijt

For the reasons discussed above, simple OLS estimates of (1) are likely to be
inconsistent. For example, because TPjt implicitly depends on Yjt and Wjt, any
misspecification of g(Yjt,Wjt) would mean that TPjt would be correlated with either ηjt and
εijt or both. We therefore estimate (1) by instrumental variables, using ABOVEjt as an
instrument, where ABOVEjt = 1 if the wage and salary income of the policyholder is
greater than 100 percent of the wage base.
We estimate our model in both levels and logs. When we specify the model in
levels, we assume that g(.) is a cubic function of household income and the wage and
salary income of the policyholder:
g(Yjt,Wjt) = π1Yjt + π2Yjt2 + π3Yjt3 + ρ1ωjt + ρ2ω3jt 2 + ρ3ωjt 3.
where ωjt = is the wage and salary income of the policyholder, expressed as a percentage
of the wage base. This specification is the simplest one for a "fuzzy" regression

9

This specification of the error structure allows unobserved determinants of health spending to be
arbitrarily correlated both within families and over time.

13

discontinuity model, as described by Angrist and Pischke (2009). In log form, (1)
becomes:
(2)

ln(Hijt) = θt + λlnTPjt + Xijtβ + Zjtγ + g(Yjt,Wjt) + ηt + εijt

where g(.) is a log function of household income:
g(Yjt,Wjt) = π1ln(Yjt) + ρ1ωjt + ρ2ωjt 2 + ρ3ωjt 3 .

B. Results

Table 4 presents OLS and instrumental variables estimates of the effect of the tax
preference for insurance on health spending from (1) and (2). The OLS estimates from
(1) and (2) (in columns (1) and (2)) suggest that the tax price of insurance has a small and
statistically insignificant effect on spending on health services by individuals in families
with full-year employer coverage. The IV estimates (in columns (3) and (4)), in contrast,
show that decreases in the tax price (i.e., increases in the tax preference) increase
spending. At the average level of health spending and the average tax rate, the IV
estimate in column (3) translates into an elasticity of -0.601. This estimate is slightly
smaller (in absolute value) than the elasticity of -0.741 from the log specification in
column (4). The elasticity from the linear model is statistically significantly different
from zero at the 10 percent level; the elasticity from the log model is statistically different
from zero at the 5 percent level. Hausman tests reject the consistency of the OLS
estimates of both (1) and (2) at the 5 percent level (for the linear model, p = 0.01; for the
log model, p = 0.04), suggesting that endogeneity of TP is a practical as well as
theoretical concern.

14

Table 5 presents results from six alternative specifications of (2) to investigate the
robustness of our main result. Column (1) of the table repeats the estimates from the log
model in Table 4, column (4) for ease of comparison. Column (2) presents estimates
from the model based only on individuals in households with policyholders earning
between 50 and 150 percent of the wage base. Narrowing in on the discontinuity leads to
an increase in the point estimate of the coefficient of interest (to -1.280, statistically
significant at the 5 percent level), although the standard errors are large enough that the
estimate on the restricted sample is not statistically different from the estimate on the full
sample. Column (3) reports results from a model that omits everyone under age 18; the
estimated effect changes hardly at all, although the standard error rises slightly. Columns
(4) and (5) report the effect of the tax preference on inpatient and outpatient spending
separately; the fact that inpatient spending is less price-responsive than outpatient
spending is consistent with the results from the RAND experiment and other work that
suggests that inpatient spending is less discretionary. Finally, columns (6) and (7)
replicate the analysis on the earlier and the later five-year intervals covered by the
sample, respectively. Although the effect of the tax preference is not statistically
significantly different from zero in the later subsample, it is of roughly the same
magnitude in both as in the full, pooled sample. A t-test of the difference between the
two subsamples fails to reject that they are equal (p = 0.42).
We estimated five other versions of (2) to investigate further the sensitivity of our
results. First, instead of narrowing the window around the discontinuity (as is
conventional in regression discontinuity study designs), we estimated (2) using only
observations that were distant from the discontinuity. Excluding the 4,948 individuals

15

from families with a policyholder who earned 90-110 percent of the Social Security wage
base leads to an estimated elasticity of -0.347 (standard error 0.477).10 Second, to
confirm that our result was not due to a few outliers, we excluded individuals with health
spending over $100,000. Excluding the 76 observations that met this condition, we
estimate an elasticity of -0.728 (standard error 0.374). Third, to investigate whether our
results might be due to temporary health shocks and reverse causality (running from
health status to income), we excluded individuals from families with a policyholder who
switched from above to below (or below to above) the wage base in their two years in the
MEPS panel. Excluding these 5,494 observations, we estimate an elasticity of -0.750
(with a standard error of 0.443). Fourth, to investigate the possibility of reverse causality
further, we reestimated the model using only family members other than the wage earner
who holds the insurance policy. Including only these 48,507 observations, we estimate
an elasticity of -1.404 (standard error 0.463). Fifth, we reestimated the model using
placebo instruments that were 10 percent below and 10 percent above the true
discontinuity. Using these instruments, we estimate elasticities of -0.321 (standard error
0.786) and -0.253 (standard error 0.576), respectively.
We also investigated whether the tax price affects coverage, to explore the extent
to which this channel might accentuate the effect of the tax price conditional on having
coverage. We estimated a model similar to (1), but on a sample of all employed people
whether or not they had full-year employer-sponsored insurance (N = 111,139). We used
as the dependent variable the percentage of the year that the individual had coverage. In
10

The fact that the estimated effect of the tax preferences is statistically insignificant based on observations
that are distant from the Social Security wage base can be explained by two facts: that the difference in
Social Security tax rates above versus below the wage base is partially undone by differences in income tax
rates, and that there is a positive income elasticity of demand for health insurance that is not fully captured
by our regression specification.

16

elasticity terms, the instrumental variable estimate of the tax-price effect on coverage is 0.096 (with a standard error of 0.041, significant at the 5 percent level). We discuss the
economic importance of this effect in Section VI below.

V. UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH THE TAX
EFFECT OCCURS

It is possible that our results could be generated by an unobserved process that is
correlated with a threshold effect of policyholders' wage and salary income but not
caused by tax incentives. To investigate this concern, we test whether earning above
versus below the Social Security tax threshold affects individuals' choice of insurance
policy, as economic theory suggests that it should. This choice may occur at the
employer level, by affecting the set of plans that are offered, or at the employee level, by
affecting the plan that is taken up. In either event, if the estimated effect of the tax
preference affects health spending by altering choice of insurance policy, then individuals
with a greater tax subsidy should be covered by insurance that has higher premiums,11
and this effect should only occur for individuals whose premiums are paid with pre-tax
dollars.12
To investigate whether this is true, we use data from the 1996-1998 Community
Tracking Study (CTS). The CTS consists of three surveys: an Employer Survey, a

11

The premium for an insurance policy is identically related to the policy's generosity, as measured by its
actuarial value. Given that a policy's actuarial value, AV, is defined as the share of health spending that the
policy would cover for the average person, its premiums is (1 + L) * AV * E(S), where E(S) is the expected
spending of the policyholder(s) and L is the administrative cost, or load, of the insurance.
12
Purchases of employer-sponsored health insurance can be made with pre-tax dollars under two
conditions: if the premiums are (nominally) paid by the employer, or if the premiums are paid by the
employee through a Section 125, or "cafeteria," plan. However, premiums paid by employees (even
through withheld salary) occur after-tax if the employer does not have a plan that qualifies under Section
125 of the Internal Revenue Code.

17

Household Survey, and a Followback Survey. The Employer Survey, conducted in 1997,
collects information about the health insurance policies that the respondent employers
provide (if any); the total premium per employee paid for single-person coverage,
including both employee contributions and the amount paid by the employer on the
employee's behalf; the share of the total premium that is paid by the employer on the
employee's behalf; and employer characteristics (industry and firm size). The Household
Survey, administered in 1996-97, is a national sample of households that can be matched
to the Followback Survey. The Followback Survey, administered in 1997-98 to
organizations that offered or administered private health insurance policies covering
Household Survey respondents, collects detailed information on cost sharing,
gatekeeping, and other characteristics of insurance policies (such as whether the policies
are HMOs, PPOs, or point-of-service plans). For each household with a respondent
holding employer-sponsored health insurance, the matched Household/Followback
Survey sample thus contains detailed characteristics of each respondent's health insurance
policy, similar (although not identical) to the information collected by the Employer
Survey; of each respondent household's insurance policyholder, including his or her wage
and salary income, age, gender, and educational attainment; of each respondent
household's insurance policyholder's firm (industry and firm size); and of each
respondent household (household income and household size). The variables from all
three surveys are described in an Appendix (available from the authors).
Ideally, to test whether the tax preference affects choice of insurance policy, we
would know for each policyholder of employer-sponsored insurance, the wage and salary
income of the policyholder, the generosity of the insurance policy, and the share of the

18

policy that was financed with pre-tax dollars. However, although the matched
Household/Followback Survey contains information on wage and salary income, it does
not contain information on generosity, and none of the three surveys contains information
on the tax status of payments for employer-sponsored health insurance.
We approximate this ideal in the following way. Using the Employer Survey, we
run regressions of total premium per employee, Pk, and the share of premiums paid by the
employer (for firms providing employer-sponsored health insurance), Sk, on the firm and
insurance policy characteristics, Uk, where k = 1…K firms. These regressions are of the
following form:
Pk = φ1Uk + εk
Sk = φ2Uk + ηk .
Then, we construct a vector of firm and insurance policy characteristics Uj for
each individual j in the matched Household/Followback Survey who holds an employersponsored insurance policy, where Uj is defined identically to Uk. With this information,
we calculate for each employer-sponsored insurance policyholder his or her predicted
ˆ
ˆ
premium, P j  ˆ1U j , and predicted share of premium paid by employer, S j  ˆ 2U j ,

using estimates of φ1 and φ2 from the Employer Survey. Finally, using the matched
Household/Followback Survey, we run regressions of predicted premiums on the
characteristics of the insurance policyholder and his or her household listed in the
appendix, Vj; polynominals in the policyholder's household income, Yj, and his or her
wage and salary income ωj (expressed as a percentage of the 1997 Social Security wage
base); and an indicator for whether the policyholder's wage and salary income was
greater than 100 percent of the wage base, ABOVEj:

where h(.), Yj, and ωj are defined as they are in the health spending models. We
estimate this model on the full sample of all respondents with employer-sponsored
insurance and on the half of the sample with above the median value for the predicted
share of premium paid by employer (85 percent).
Estimates of υ4 from this model, the effect of earning above the Social Security
tax threshold on predicted premiums, are a lower bound on the effect on actual premiums.
First, the estimate only captures the impact of the tax threshold on the portion of
individuals' premiums that are correlated with their firm and insurance policy
characteristics. Second, using predicted premiums instead of actual premiums leads to
conservative estimates because predicted premiums do not depend on any of the
characteristics of individuals in the firm. Therefore, by construction, estimates of the
effect of the tax threshold on premiums obtained in this way cannot be due to any
unobserved characteristics of individuals that may be correlated with wage and salary
levels and health status.
Selected parameter estimates from this model (and its logarithmic analog) are in
Table 6. The leftmost two columns of the table present results from the full sample.
Holders of employer-sponsored insurance who earn above the Social Security threshold
have lower predicted premiums, holding constant a polynomial in their wage and salary
income, their household income, and their other characteristics, although this effect is not
statistically significant. The rightmost two columns present results from the half of the
sample who, based on the characteristics of their insurance policy and their firm, have at

20

least 85 percent of their premium paid by their employers. For individuals in this
subsample, premiums are almost entirely paid out of pre-tax dollars. The effect on
predicted premiums of earning above the Social Security threshold is more negative and
singificant at the 5 percent level.

VI.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

As health policy analysts have long observed, the tax preference for health
insurance is likely a key cause of inefficiency in the U.S. health care system. By making
health spending in general, and insured health spending in particular, appear less costly
than they are, the tax preference gives employees the incentive to take compensation as
health insurance rather than cash -- even if the value of the spending to the employee is
significantly less than its cost to society. In this paper, we use a new identification
strategy to estimate the magnitude of the tax preference's effect on health spending.
Using the fact that Social Security taxes are only levied on earnings below a statutory
threshold to identify exogenous variation in tax rates, we find a statistically and
economically significant effect of the tax preference for insurance on spending.
Our estimates of the tax-price elasticity of demand for health care spending of 0.601 and -0.741, depending on specification, are squarely within the range reported in
earlier work. Gruber and Lettau (2004), for example, find an elasticity of firm-level
insurance spending with respect to the tax price of -0.7; Smart and Stabile (2005) find
tax-price elasticities of the demand for health services in the range of -0.7 to -1.0. The
fact that our estimates, derived using a very different method than earlier work, are in the

21

same range should give health policy analysts greater confidence that the true effect lies
in this range.
The elasticities in Table 4 can be used to simulate how much health spending by
privately-insured individuals would fall if the tax preference were repealed. Given that
the average federal marginal tax rate (including Social Security and Medicare taxes) in
our sample is 35.9 percent (authors' unpublished calculation), repealing the tax preference
would increase the after-tax price of insured expenditures from 0.641p to p, where p is
the before-tax price of health care. Evaluated at the average after-tax price, this amounts
to a 43.8 percent price increase (=0.359p / (0.5*(0.641p + p)). At an elasticity of -0.601
(table 4, column (3)), this increase translates into a 26.3 percent decrease in health
spending; at an elasticity of -0.741 (Table 4, column (4)), this increase translates into a
32.5 percent decrease (1.002*0.438) in health spending.
These effects, while quite large, are consistent with the results from other
simulation models, including our own work. Among individuals with nonzero health
spending in our sample, the average coinsurance rate, as measured by the share of health
spending that is out-of-pocket, is 32.3 percent. According to Jack and Sheiner (Table 2,
1997), at a tax preference for insurance of 32.8 percent, an effective coinsurance rate of
this magnitude implies a coefficient of relative risk aversion of approximately 1.5. At a
coefficient of relative risk aversion of 1.5, repealing the tax preference in their model
leads to an approximate doubling of the coinsurance rate; this result is similar to the
effect of the tax preference simulated by Feldstein and Friedman (1977). A doubling of
the coinsurance rate from 32 to 64 percent, in turn, would lead to a decline in health
spending of between 13.3 percent (at the RAND experiment's estimate of the elasticity of

22

demand for health services of -0.2) and 46.7 percent (at Eichner's (1998) elasticity of
demand for health services of -0.7).13 Gruber (Table 5, 2002) reports that removing all
tax subsidies for health insurance would result in a 35.4 percent decline in health
spending among individuals who are offered insurance by their employer, expressed as a
percentage point change from its initial value. Expressed as a percentage-point change at
the average (in order to make his estimate comparable to the others), this difference
amounts to a 43.0 percent decline in health spending. 14
Simulations of the effect of repealing the tax preference based on our empirical
elasticity estimates, however, may either overstate or understate the true effect. On the
one hand, if spending becomes less responsive as the tax preference is phased out and the
level of spending is reduced, then the effects of repeal will be smaller than observational
data would predict. On the other hand, a nationwide change in tax policy may lead to a
larger change in coinsurance rates and health spending than observational data based on
small differences in marginal tax rates would predict. Amy Finkelstein (2007), for
example, shows that the change in hospital spending associated with the introduction of
Medicare was far greater than the elasticities from the RAND Experiment would have
predicted. In addition, our estimates are based on the elasticity of behavior of individuals
at the upper end of the income distribution (i.e., around the Social Security threshold); the
elasticity at the mean income may be either larger or smaller.
Our estimates of the effect of the tax preference on coverage are quite modest,
consistent with the findings of other work (Gruber and Washington, 2005). As discussed
above in Section IV, the elasticity of the number of days of insurance coverage with

13
14

That is, 0.133 = 0.2*(0.32 / (0.5*(0.32+0.64))) and 0.467 = 0.7*(0.32 / (0.5*(0.32+0.64))).
That is, 0.43 = (0.354 / (.5*(0.354+(1-0.354)))).

23

respect to TP is -0.096 in this population, which means that even complete repeal of the
tax preference would lead to only a 4.2 percent decrease in the number of covered days;15
at an average coverage rate of 92 percent, this translates into a decrease of 14 days
(authors' unpublished calculation). This finding has two implications. First, subject to
the caveats above, it implies that repealing the tax preference would likely have little
effect on coverage for the full-year employed population that is the subject of our study.
Second, it implies very small consequences for health spending. Using the estimates of
the effect of coverage on health spending from Jack Hadley et al. (2008), decreasing
coverage by 14 days would decrease expenditures by around $85 per year per person, or
approximately 2 percent.16
Future work might seek to investigate the effect of the tax preference on health
outcomes. The RAND Experiment found no significant effect of the tax preference on
insurance generosity for the average adult, which, combined with our estimates, would
suggest that the tax preference for insurance leads to massive inefficiency in the
allocation of resources. However, the RAND Experiment did find some effects of health
spending for vulnerable subpopulations, and in any event is now based on medical
technology that is considerably out-of-date. Without better information about how health
spending currently affects health, translating the findings of this paper into implications
for social welfare must necessarily be left to future research.

15

From above, repeal of the tax preference represents a 43.8 percent increase in TP , which implies a 4.2
percent decrease in the number of covered days because -0.042 = 0.438 * -0.096.
16
Hadley et al. (2008) calculate that spending per year for a full-year insured person is $3,915, or $10.73
per day; spending per year for a full-year uninsured person is $1,686, or $4.62 per day. Thus, decreasing a
person's coverage by 14 days would lead to a decline in spending of $85 = 14*($10.73 - $4.62), or 2.4
percent on a base of $3,593 (= $3,915*(335/365)).

Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are in parentheses. One observation is one
employer-sponsored-insurance policyholder. Based on matched Household and Followback
Survey data from the 1996-1998 Community Tracking Study. Predicted premiums and the
percentage of predicted premiums paid by the employer imputed based on the characteristics of
the policyholder's insurance policy and the policyholder's employer (industry and firm size). In
regressions but not reported in table are age fixed effects, CTS site fixed effects (approximately
equal to MSA fixed effects), and coefficients on gender, marital status, family size, and
education.
