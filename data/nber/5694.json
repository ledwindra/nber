    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper provides a formal model of endogenous country formation and of choice of defense spending in a world with international conflict.  The model is consistent with three observations.  First, secessions and, more generally, break-up of countries should follow a reduction in the likelihood of international conflict.  Second, the number of regional conflicts between smaller countries may increase as a result of the break-up of larger countries.  Third, the size of the peace divided -- i.e., the reduction in the defense spending in a more peaceful world -- is limited by the process of country break-up.\n\n",
