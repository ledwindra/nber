Corporate Taxes and Incentives and the Structure of Production:
A Selected Survey

ABSTRACT
Inthis
paperwe develop a general intertemporal model of production, emand
phasizing the role of present and expected future corporate income taxes, credits
allowances along with costly adjustment and variable utilization of the quasi—fixed
factors.

Three specific issues are considered: 1) the direct and indirect effects of taxes

the
operatiog through factor prices on the long—run input substitution, thus altering
structure of the production process; 2) the effects of tax policy changes on the rate
and direction of technological change; and 3) the effects of tax policy on the inter—
temporal pattern of substitutions and complementarities among the inputs that arise
due to presence of quasi—fixity of some inputs. The rates of utilization of the quasi—
fixed factors are determined in the short—run in conjunction with the demands for
variable factors of production.

the

Hence, utilization rates depend on product and factor

prices and therefore on tax policy. We specialize the general model in order to
highlight each

of the three themes and their interaction with tax policy. We also

discuss the various ways in which empirical implementation of the theoretical models

and a brief summary of the empirical results in the literature is also provided. Lastly,
we discuss some policy implications which emerge from the analysis and empirical
results.

1. Introduction
Over the past few decades, tax policy has been an important instrument of the

government to influence both fluctuations and growth in the economy. Initially,
economists emphasized the link between taxes and demand as the channel through
which tax policy affected the cyclical variability and secular trend of output and
thereby employment and capiI accumulation. Now, however, we have come to
recognize

that there are also significant direct influences of tax policy on production.

Tax rates, credits and allowances affect the costs incurred by firms in hiring labour,
investing in equipment and structure, using energy, and undertaking research and deThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the models used to evaluate the
effects of tax policy on the structure of production and to discuss the substantive
velopment.

results arising from the empirical application of these models.

The predominant focus in studies of production has been related to the degree to
which factors of production are substitutable and to the biases associated with technological change. Substitution possibilities characterize the manner in which firms
alter their input demands in the face of changing relative factor prices.

As

Technological change generates new structures of production.

In general,

the sense that the new production processes tilt relative input demands. However,

a vacuum, but rather it is influenced by the

same determinants as factor demands, namely product and factor prices.

quite different from the effects occurring in the long—run. For example, a decrease in
the corporate income tax rate can lower the effective cost of production, therefore
causing output to expand.

if there are

some factors which are qoasi—fixed, then

creases in short—run output production occur more int'nsely, osing

in-

the variable factors

of production. However, as the adjustment costs are incurred (the lower tax rate
could also help in this regard) and investment takes place, the quasi—fixed factors are

substituted for the variable factors in the long—run. The existence of adjustment
costs changes the manner in which taxes affect production and the effectiveness of the
policy.

Adjustment costs fix the level of the quasi—fixed factors in the short—run and
cause the gradual adjustment to their long—run magnitudes. However, the rate at
which the quasi—fixed factors are utilized in the short—run may also vary.

If utiliza-

tion of the quasi—fixed factors is not costless (for example, due to overtime and shift
wage premiums or greater depreciation costs), then firms may find it desirable to leave

idle portions of the quasi—fixed factors in order to meet future production require—

ments.

The rates of utilization of the quasi—fixed factors are determined in the

short—run in conjunction with the demands for the variable factors of production.
Hence, utilization rates depend on product and factor prices and therefore on tax
policy. For example,

a decrease in the corporate income tax rate which causes output

to expand can generate increases in the demand for variable factors and increases in

the rates of quasi—fixed factor 'tilization.

Since the latter

Corporate tax rates, credits and allowances influence the long—run substitution of
all factors of production, the short—run utilization and the dynamic adjustment of the
quasi—fixed factors.

This survey is based upon these themes.

theoretical and empirical models, and to see the problems in empirical implementation.

2. A Model of Production, Investment and Taxation
There are two objectives of this section. First a model is developed in which
the effect of taxes on production and investment can be analyzed within the general
themes of factor substitution, adjustment and utilization, output expansion and

tech-

nological change. The second objective is to provide a framework in which to organize

and evaluate the empirical

reseah of this topic.

We begin by characterizing production and investment decisions.

The specification of the technology is flexible enough to include the costs associated with installation and utilization of capital. The costs associated with capital
utilization are introduced in manner similar to the general approach developed by
Hicks (1946), Malinvaud (1953), Bliss (1975), and Diewert (1980).

Each time, the

firm combines the beginning of period capital inputs

with the non—capital inputs

to produce output and the capital inputs to be used for future production (K°j.
Thus, the firm produces two kinds of output: one type for current sale (y4 and one
type for future production

(K).

Utilization is captured through the selection of capi—

tal for future production. The choice of the end of period capital reflects decisions on
the using and repairing of the capital inputs which are available at the beginning of
the period. The specific process of capital utilization is embedded or internal to the
production process and

is captured by the tranformation function.

This is reflected hy the vector of

in the transformation function. The installation costs are

inter-

nal to the production process since the specific process of capital installations is captured by the transformation function, Resources devoted to installing capital must be
directed away from producing current output and repairing existing capital.

The cost

of installing additional capital is the opportunity cost of foregone current output and
foregone capital repairs. The existence of installation costs for certain types of inputs
implies that there is

an adjustment process associated with these inputs, and so they

are referred to as quasi—fixed factors. The other inputs are called variable facturs.
In the present context, there are essentially two kinds of investment undertaken
by the firm: one type arises through capital purchases and one type results from
maintaining the existing capital stocks.

Thus, there are two ways in which capital

the larger capital stocks.
There are some interesting features contained in equation set (15). First, not only

the post—tax purchase price of additional capital stocks. Second, embedded in the

The complete model consists of equation sets (13) and (15). We can see that
empirical models which do not consider the potentially important influences of changes in

of corporate taxes and the structure of production in a dynamic context. The empirical
literature on taxation and the structure of production has, in recent times, moved towards
the implementation

of

a general

model

of production in order to address the

issues related

to the influence of taxes on factor substitution, adjustment, and utilization as well as output expansion and technological ch&ige, The purpose of this and the following sections of
this paper is to analyse, within the context of the general theoretical model, the empirical
work on the interaction between taxes and production decisions. We undertake this task
by discussing the substantive empirical findings along with the nature of the models used

to obtain these results.
The first issue we discuss pertains to the effects of taxes on factor substitution.

We

can address this issue by assuming that utilization and installation are costless and current
prices and tax policy are always expected to persist. Thus the determination of production
decisions can be simplified to the following two stage procedure.

This leads to equations similar to (12.1) and (12.2). In addition, a post—tax variable
profit function can be defined in a similar fashion for equation (13.1) with the derived
conditions similar to equations (13.2) and (13.3).

In this simpler context,

Although the properties of the post—tax variable profit function are similar to those for the
function given by the right side of (13.1), there are some differences,

First, in the case

defined by equation (17.1), post—tax variable profits are defined as revenue minus variable
input costs. The value of the unutilized quasi—fixed factors does not have to be added to
revenue, as in the general model, because utilization is costless and thereby exogenous.
Moreover, this implies that the post tax purchase prices of the quasi—fixed factors do not

enter the variable profit function.

The empirical implementation of the model defined by equations (17) and (19)

Moreover, because

the post—tax rental rates of capital are time invariant, we can combine the two stages of
production decisions and correspondingly define

a

post—tax profit function.

In addition,

empirical implementation is often mainly concerned with factor substitution, and so

it is

generally assumed that output levels are predetermined. In this instance, only the cost
function needs to

be specified.

Many different functional forms for the cost function have

been introduced over the years (see Berndt

and Khaled

[1979}). Probably

often used in this context is the translog (see Christensen, Jorgenson and Lau [1973]), Fuss

The results from the elimination of the investment tax credit for the period 1962 to
1971 for U.S. manufacturing were that total labour demand would have been around .7%
higher over the period. Employment of blue—collar workers would have been about 1.1%

higher, while employment of white—collar workers would have fallen about .3 percent.

Generaiiy. two types of models have been deveioped which relate to factor adjustment, The first typa emphasizes the trade—off between futors increases in the quasi—fixed

with increasing adjustments speeds. The higher costs appear either as higher purchase

The second type of model of factor adjustment recognizes that changes in the quasi—

balanced by

Berndt, Fuss and Waverman estimated this model for U.S. manufacturing for the
period 1947—1974 and incorporated the corporate income tax rate, investment tax credit
and capital cost allowance into the post—tax rental rate on capital. From our point of
view,

the most

significant result

of this paper is that the

long—run price elasticities on the

conditional factor demands (both variable and quasi—fixed) are considerably smaller than
their counterparts obtained in models with no adjustment costs. This means that, for U.S.
manufacturing, the influence of tax policy on long—run factor demands is significantly
smaller than previous empirical evidence showed,

The misspecification caused by assuming

all factors can be costlessly adjusted caused an upward bias in the influences of factor
prices, and thereby tax policy, on input demands.

The second approach to the empirical implementation of the intertemporal production
model is the dual approach developed by Rockafeller (1970), Benveniste and Schienkman
(1979), McLaren and Cooper (1980) and Epstein (1981).

The focus of this approach is not

the variable profit function defined by (23.1) (or the variable cost function) but rather the
value function defined by equation (10).

Unlike the direct approach, dynamic duality can

handle much more general specifications of the technology, including the quasi—fixed factor
adjustment mechanisms. However, the treatment of expectations formation processes

is

much more limited using the dual approach.
The dual approach can be presented in the following context. Assume that there

The fact that the empirical results are based on

a dynamic model permits the inves-

tigation of short— and long—run effects on factor demands.

In addition, the speed

nf the

adjustment process is estimated.

Bernstein determines the annual adjustment from the
short to the long—run effect of any tax policy initiative. In the study, this type of
analysis is conducted for R&D expenditures, because of its focus on policies influencing R&D
investment. However, the analysis applies equally to the other factor demands.
Changes in tax credit and allowance rates decrease post—tax factor prices and thereby

decrease production and adjustment costs.

Using an intertemporal application of

Shepherd's Lemma based on the value function permits the determination of the cost to

Inwance rates. However, this analysis does not necessarily capture changes in efficiency as—

—37—.

sociated with changes in tax policy (see Diewert (1985(a))), and Jorgenson and stoker
(1985). Bernstein investigates the relative effectiveness of alternative tax policies on the

structure of production when the cost to the government across tax policy changes
equalized. In additon, a calculation is made of the actual coet to the government
alternative tax policy initiatives. The calculations show that changes in tax credit and

per dollar of lost tax revenue at the existing level of output. Moreover, an increase in the
physical investment tax credit generates around $06 of R&D expenditure per dollar of lost

tax revenue. This figure increases to around $.i5 when output effects are considered.
Hence, there may be important cross effects arising from government tax policy changes
directed towards

a particular factor of production or type of investment.

Excluding these

cross effects biases the cost estimates and the influence of tax policy on production and
investment.
The third approach to the implementation of the model given by equations (23) and
(25) is

to treat the first order

conditions for

the

quasi—fixed factors as implicit equations

and not obtain closed form solutions. This is the approach developed and implemented by
Kennan [1979], Hansen and Singleton [1982], Pindyck and Rotemberg [1983], and Bernstein
and Nadiri [1986].

This approach, which may be reffered to as the implicit approach,

specifies a functional form for the variable profit (or variable cost function) which is jointly

estimated with the reduced form variable factor demand equations and the implicit equations for the quasi—fixed factors. This approach permits
specifications

technology and the expectations generating processes because the first

There are two difficulties with this implicit approach. First, because closed

form

solutions are not obtained for the quasi—fixed factors, there are no conditions in the model
guaranteeing the optimality (existence and uniqueness) of the factor demands for any set of

—38—

price trajectories. In other words the terminal or transversality conditions are ignored, as
only the first order conditions are used.

In terms

of the estimation of

5, Taxez and Factor Utilization

It

has long been recognized that although adjustment costs cause the quasi—fixity of

factors of production, the rates

at which these factors are utilized are variable in the

Indeed, these rates are part of the

firm's production plan which are dependent

on the stocks of quasi—fixed factors and post—tax product and factor prices.

Thus, in the

short—run changes in tax policy do not affect the stocks of quasi—fixed factors, they do
influence the rates

the model

at which these stocks are accumulated and utilized. This

developed in section 2

is precisely

of this paper and is represented by equation sets

(13) and

(15).

Generally, there have been two types of models relating to the factor utilization.
The first type due to Lucas [1970], Winston and McCoy [1974], Abel [1981] and Bernstein
[1983] emphasize

the

trade—off between increased output and higher labour costs

that

utilization generates. The increase in costs manifest themselves in terms of overtime and
shift wage premiums. These models are able to capture the positive correlation between
real wages and labour utilization and the positive correlation between capital utilization and
capital stock (see Foss [1981]).
The short—run interrelationship between utilization and investment is the mechanism
in these models by which utilization affects the accumulation of the quasi—fixed factor.
There is no connection between capital utlization and depreciation rates or between labour
utilization and quit rates. Thus the costs of higher utilization rates are not reflected in
the lifetime of the quasi—fixed factors.
The second type of model of factor utilization recognizes that changes in the rate of
utilization alter the lifetime of a quasi—fixed factor. In this case, the benefits of increased
current output are balanced by the costs of decreased future output,
utilization is foregone future output.

The cost of factor

Ths difficulty with this is approach

is

that

the trend itself is a function of relative prices and the magnitudes of the quasi—fixed factors. As these variables change, the trend varies and must be revised. However, the revisions to tbe trend occur extraneously to the model which is in fact supposed to explain

utilization variation.
A second approach recognizes

that inventories (or at least departures from some

long—run level) are linked to the rate

at

which capital (and other quasi—fixed factors) is

utilized. For example, an increase in inventories relative to the long—run level signifies a
fall in product demand and decrease in factor utilization. This method has been explored
recently by Helliwell and Chung (1985). The integration of the theory of optimal

in-

ventory holdings with the theory of factor utilization and investment offers the potential of

an important avenue in which to investigate the role of tax

In addition, capital

The reasons are first
that the empirical work in this area has focused on the putty—clay type of vintage model

(see Bischoif (1971), King (1972), Sumner (1974), and Malcomson (1982)). In other words,
once installed factor proportions are fixed This implies that changes in tax rates and incentives cannot affect the rate of factor substitution of installed capital. Second, these
studies assume that the service life uf capital is constant, which means that tax policy does
not affect the rate of capital utilization. The model in the text could be modified to allow
for alternative vintages of capital. The transformation function in this case would depend
on the vector of all past investment flows for all types of investment rather than on the
vectors of beginning— and end—period capital. (See Diewert (1985)).
The focus is not on the financial decisions of the firm and so it is assumed that the
firm issues one kind of bond and one kind of share.

Since tbere are no adjustment costs, all inputs are variable. Also, time (t) designates

The disturbances in the share equations could also reflect technology shocks. However,
in this case, the disturbance in the cost equation must be contemporaneously correlated

10. Recently Rao and Preston (1983), using the same framework as Fraumeni and
Jorgenson (1980) have investigated the effects of factor prices on factor demands and the
rate of productivity growth for 9 Canadian manufacturing industries and 8 non—
manufacturing Canadian industries for the period 1957—1979. They did not investigate the
effects of tax policy on the structure of production. Surprisingly, their results were quite
different than obtained by Fraumeni and Jorgenson. In particular, technological change
generally appears to be capital—reducing.
11. An excellent survey on the role of R&D capital in production activities is by Criliches
(1979).
12. Hansen and Sargent (1981) have developed a model where adjustment costs do not
have to depend on first order differences in the quasi—fixed factors. Their procedure has
not as yet been implemented.
13. In a recent paper, Epstein and Yatchew (1985) develop and estimate a model which
assumes that the technology is quadratic with adjustment costs based on first order dii—
ferences and expectations are based on autoregressive processes. Because they estimate the

quadratic production function and autoregressive expectations equations along with the
derived factor demand equations, they could test all of the cross equation restrictions im—
plied by the firm's programming plan and expectations processes.

The specification of adjustment costs, which depend on net rather than
changes
in the quasi—fixed factors and separable from the production technology, isgross
not a significant difference, provided that aggregation over firms need not be theoretically justifiable.
If firm aggregation is to be rigorously treated, then parameter restrictions must be imposed
on the technology. However, as Blackorby and Schworm (1983) have shown, these restrictions are inconsistent with flexible accelerator factor demands when both positive and negative changes in the Qs occur. This inconsistency can be avoided by the use of gross investment.

16. The disturbances in the factor demand equations (29) can also reflect technology
shocks. However, by a similar argument to that presented in footnote 9, estimation problems arise. The error in the production function, from which the factor demands are
derived, must be contemporaneously correlated with each of the factors in order for technology shocks to appear in each of the factor demand functions.
17. W is also defined in the discussion after equation (19). It is an outcome of the
static price and tax expectations assumption. The disturbance in the investment equation
represents optimizing or measurement errors. If the disturbance reflects technology shocks,
then the error in the normalized variable cost function is contemporaneously correlated with
the quasi—fixed factor.

Epstein and Denny (1983) estimate models with both static expectatns and expecta—
tions generated by first order autoregressive processes. However, in
iatcer case the
processes were estimated independently of the productioo decisione.
In addition, this functional form is consistent with aggregation to' c.tions guaranteeing
existence of a representative firm (see Diewert 1980), Epstein and Denny (1983) anC
Blackorby and Schworm (1983)).
