Epidemics in the Neoclassical and New Keynesian Models

NBER Working Paper No. 27430
June 2020
JEL No. E1,H0,I1
ABSTRACT
We analyze the effects of an epidemic in three standard macroeconomic models. We find that the
neoclassical model does not rationalize the positive comovement of consumption and investment
observed in recessions associated with an epidemic. Introducing monopolistic competition into
the neoclassical model remedies this shortcoming even when prices are completely flexible.
Finally, sticky prices lead to a larger recession but do not fundamentally alter the predictions of
the monopolistic competition model.

Introduction

A central feature of recessions is the positive comovement between output, hours worked,
consumption, and investment. In this respect, the COVID-19 recession is not unique. At
least since Barro and King (1984), it has been recognized that, absent aggregate productivity
shocks, it is di¢cult for many models to generate comovement in macroeconomic aggregates.
So, a natural question is: what class of models generates comovement in a recession caused
by an epidemic?
To address this question, we extend the framework developed in Eichenbaum, Rebelo,
and Trabandt (2020a) to include investment. A key feature of that framework is that an
epidemic naturally generates negative shifts in both the demand for consumption and the
supply of labor. These shifts arise because consumption and working increase the risks of
infection for people who are not immune to the virus.
We consider three canonical macroeconomic models: the neoclassical model, a flexibleprice model with monopolistic competition, and a New Keynesian model with sticky prices.
Calibrated versions of all three models generate recessions in response to an epidemic. However, the neoclassical model fails to generate positive comovement between investment and
consumption. In contrast, both the model with monopolistic competition and flexible prices,
and the New Keynesian model succeed in doing so. In addition, both models imply that the
epidemic is accompanied by a moderate decline in the inflation rate.
The intuition for our results is as follows. Consider first the neoclassical model. Suppose
that people can become infected through consumption activities but not by working. Then,
an epidemic leads to a large drop in consumption and a boom in investment. The latter
boom reflects two forces: the household wants to consume more once the infection wanes
and it wants to smooth hours worked over time. By building up the capital stock, it can
accomplish both objectives.
Now suppose that people can become infected by working but not through consumption
activities. Then, an epidemic leads to a small decline in consumption but a large fall in
hours worked and output. There is also a large fall in investment because households smooth
consumption in the face of a transitory fall in income.
In the calibrated version of the model, people can become infected through both consumption and working activities. We find that the shift in consumption demand dominates
the shift in labor supply. So consumption falls but investment remains above its steady-state

1

value throughout most of the epidemic.
In contrast, in the monopolistic competition model the shift in labor supply dominates
the shift in consumption demand. So an epidemic generates a steep recession along with
sharp declines in both consumption and investment. The shift in labor supply becomes
more important because monopolistic competition reduces the real wage relative to the case
of perfect competition. A lower wage means that the compensation to a worker for being
exposed to the virus is lower. The household responds by reducing hours worked of nonimmune people by more than it does under perfect competition. As a result, consumption
and investment comove positively.
Sticky prices increase the depth of the recession relative to the model with monopolistic
competition and flexible prices. But the e§ect of sticky prices is relatively small. The
intuition for this result is as follows. It is well known that nominal price rigidities exacerbate
the e§ects of negative demand shifts. But they alleviate the impact of negative supply
shifts.1 Since both shifts are operative during an epidemic, sticky prices do not, on net, have
a strong e§ect on the response of output to an epidemic.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 we study the
e§ects of an epidemic in the neoclassical model. Sections 4 and 5 discuss the e§ects of an
epidemic in a monopolistically competitive model and a New Keynesian model, respectively.
Section 6 reviews the related literature and Section 7 concludes.

An epidemic in the neoclassical model

In this section, we describe the e§ects of an epidemic in two versions of the neoclassical
growth model: with competitive producers and with monopolistic competition. The economy
is initially in a steady state where all people are identical. The population is then divided
into four groups: susceptible (people who have not yet been exposed to the virus), infected
(people who have been infected by the virus), recovered (people who survived the infection
and acquired immunity), and deceased (people who died from the infection). We denote
the fraction of the initial population in each group by St , It , Rt and Dt , respectively. The
variable Tt denotes the number of newly infected people.

See Woodford (2011) and Gali (2015) for classic discussions of the e§ect of demand and supply shocks
in New Keynesian models.

At time zero, a fraction " of the population is infected by a virus:
I0 = ".
The rest of the population is susceptible to the virus:
S0 = 1 − ".
Social interactions occur at the beginning of the period (infected and susceptible people
meet). Then, changes in health status unrelated to social interactions (recovery or death)
occur. At the end of the period, the consequences of social interactions materialize and Tt
susceptible people become infected.
As in Eichenbaum, Rebelo and Trabandt (2020a,b), we assume that susceptible people
can become infected in three ways: purchasing consumer goods, working, and through random interactions unrelated to economic activity. The number of newly infected people is
given by the transmission function:
!
!
"
"
Tt = π 1 (St Cts ) It Cti + π 2 (St Nts ) It Nti + π 3 St It .

(1)

The variables Cts and Cti represent the consumption of a susceptible and infected person,
respectively. The variables Nts and Nti represent hours worked of a susceptible and infected
person, respectively. The number of newly infected people that results from consumptionrelated interactions is given by π 1 (St Cts ) (It Cti ). The terms St CtS and It CtI represent total
consumption of susceptible and infected people, respectively. The parameter π 1 reflects both
the amount of time spent in consumption activities and the probability of becoming infected
as a result of those activities.
The number of newly infected people that results from interactions at work is given by
"
!
π 2 (St NtS ) It NtI . The terms St NtS and It NtI represent total hours worked by susceptible and

infected people, respectively. The parameter π 2 reflects the probability of becoming infected
as a result of work interactions.
Susceptible and infected people can meet in ways unrelated to consuming or working.
The number of random meetings between infected and susceptible people is St It . These
meetings result in π 3 St It newly infected people. The number of susceptible people at time
t + 1 is given by:
St+1 = St − Tt .
3

(2)

The number of infected people at time t + 1 is equal to the number of infected people at
time t plus the number of newly infected people (Tt ) minus the number of infected people
who recovered (π r It ) and the number of infected people who died (π d It ):
It+1 = It + Tt − (π r + π d ) It .

(3)

Here, π r is the rate at which infected people recover from the infection and π d is the probability that an infected person dies.
The number of recovered people at time t + 1 is the number of recovered people at time
t plus the number of infected people who just recovered (π r It ):
Rt+1 = Rt + π r It .

(4)

Finally, the number of deceased people at time t + 1 is the number of deceased people at
time t plus the number of new deaths (π d It ):
Dt+1 = Dt + π d It .

(5)

People have rational expectations so that they are aware of the initial infection and
understand the laws of motion governing population health dynamics.

Equilibrium conditions In equilibrium, the market for goods and hours worked clear,
households and firms solve their maximization problems, and agents have rational expectations.
The fraction of people in the family who are susceptible, infected and recovered is the
same as the corresponding fraction in the population:
st = St , it = It , and rt = Rt .
The labor demand is equal to labor supply:
st nst + it nit + rt nrt = Nt .
The demand for goods equals goods supply:
AKt1−α Ntα = Ct + Xt + G,
where Kt is the aggregate supply of capital, kt ,
Kt = kt ,
and Ct and Xt are aggregate consumption and investment, respectively. These variables are
given by:
Ct = st cst + it cit + rt crt ,

Xt = xt .
The law of motion for the aggregate capital stock is:
Kt+1 = Xt + (1 − δ)Kt .
The appendix contains the list of model equilibrium conditions. The case of perfect competition in those equations corresponds to the special case of γ = 1.

2.1

Parameter values

We choose the same parameter values used in Eichenbaum, Rebelo and Trabandt (2020b).
Each time period corresponds to a week. We assume that it takes on average 14 days to
either recover or die from the infection. Since our model is weekly, we set π r + π d = 7/14.
Based on data for South Korea for people younger than 65 years, we choose the mortality
rate to be 0.2 percent which implies π d = 7 × 0.002/14.

We set π 1 , π 2 , and π 3 to 3.1949 × 10−7 , 1.5936 × 10−4 , and 0.4997, respectively. These

values imply that in the beginning of the epidemic 1/6 of the virus transmissions come from
consumption, 1/6 come from work and 2/3 come from non-economic activities:
π1C 2
= 1/6,
π1C 2 + π2N 2 + π3

(17)

π2N 2
= 1/6.
π1C 2 + π2N 2 + π3

(18)

Here, C and N denote consumption and hours worked in the pre-epidemic steady state,
respectively.
The initial population is normalized to one. The number of people who are initially
infected, ", is 0.001. We choose A = 1.9437 and θ = 0.001517 so that in the pre-epidemic
steady state the representative person works 28 hours per week and earns a weekly income
of $58, 000/52. We set the weekly discount factor, β, to 0.981/52 so that the value of a life is
9.3 million 2019 dollars in the pre-epidemic steady state. This value is consistent with the
economic value of life used by U.S. government agencies (see Viscusi and Aldy (2003) for a
discussion). We set the weekly depreciation rate, δ = 0.06/52 and the labor share, α = 2/3.
In the competitive model there is no markup, i.e. γ = 1. In the monopolistic competition
model, we set the parameter that determines the markup, γ, to 1.35. This value is consistent
with the range of estimates reported in Christiano, Eichenbaum and Trabandt (2016).
The steady-state share of government spending to GDP is set to 19 percent, a value that
corresponds to the average share of government expenditures in the U.S. economy. These
parameter values imply that the share of investment as a fraction of GDP is 25 percent. This
share corresponds roughly to the average share of investment in GDP in the U.S. economy
when we include purchases of consumer durables as part of investment.

The impact of an epidemic in the neoclassical model

In this section, we discuss the impact of an epidemic in the neoclassical model. This model
corresponds to the case where γ = 1. so that intermediate goods are perfect substitutes and
the net markup is zero.
Our parameterization of the transmission function (1) implies that an epidemic can be
thought of as giving rise to negative aggregate demand and aggregate supply shocks. The
10

aggregate demand shock arises because susceptible people reduce their consumption to lower
their probability of being infected. A simple way to see this e§ect is to consider the first-order
condition for cst :

!
"
1
= λbt − λτt π 1 It CtI .
s
ct

(19)

Recall that λbt > 0 is the Lagrange multiplier on the household budget constraint and λτt < 0
is the Lagrange multiplier on τ t . In equation (19), we used the fact that output is the
!
"
numeraire so Pt = 1. Other things equal, the larger is π 1 It CtI the lower is cst .
The negative aggregate supply shock arises because susceptible people reduce their hours

worked to lower their probability of becoming infected. To see this e§ect, recall the first-order
condition for nst :

!
"
θnst = λbt wt + λτt π 2 It NtI .
!
"
Other things equal, the larger is π 2 It NtI the smaller is nst .

(20)

Working in tandem, aggregate demand and supply shocks generate a prolonged reces-

sion. However, the qualitative and quantitative responses of consumption, hours worked and
investment depend very much on which shock dominates.
The previous intuition about demand and supply shocks is suggestive about the first-order
e§ects of the epidemic. There are other general equilibrium e§ects that must be considered.
As it turns out, those e§ects do not overturn the intuition based on demand and supply
shocks.
Subsections 3.1 and 3.2 focus on the e§ect of the shock to consumption demand and
labor supply, respectively. In subsection 3.3, we combine the two shocks to assess the full
impact of the epidemic.

3.1

Epidemics as a shock to the demand for consumption

To isolate the e§ect of the epidemic on consumption demand, we set π 2 to zero so that hours
worked do not a§ect the probability of a susceptible person becoming infected. We calibrate
π 1 to 6.3897 × 10−7 , so that 1/3 of the infections at the beginning of the epidemic are driven
by consumption (see equation (17)).

Figure 1 displays the impact of the epidemic on key macro variables. The main results
can be summarized as follows. First, there is a relatively small recession, with output and
hours worked falling from peak to trough by 0.4 and 0.6 percent, respectively. Second, there

11

is a very large drop in consumption (15 percent from peak to trough) and an enormous rise
in investment (33 percent from trough to peak).
Figure 2 shows consumption and hours worked for susceptible, infected and recovered
people. There is a large drop in the consumption of susceptible people (23 percent from
peak to trough). In contrast, consumption of infected and recovered people rise by a small
amount. Hours worked by susceptible, infected and recovered people are relatively stable,
exhibiting some dynamics that we discuss below.
The intuition for the results in Figures 1 and 2 is that the infection acts like a negative
shock to the demand for consumption by susceptible people. The household reduces cst to
lower the probability of susceptible people becoming infected. Consistent with this intuition,
the path for cst is the mirror image of the path for It .
The health status of infected and recovered people is not a§ected by being exposed to
the virus. So, their consumption demand does not shift down in response to movements in
It . As a result, the household does not reduce cit and crt . In fact, they rise by a modest
amount. To understand this response, note that the income of the household does not fall
by very much. But cst falls by a very large amount. The household uses a small part of the
savings from the earnings of susceptible people to fund a small rise in cit and crt .
Figure 1 shows that the household uses most of those savings to finance a massive increase
in investment. By building up the capital stock, the household makes it possible for cst to rise
once infections start to decline without large increases in nst , nit or nrt . In e§ect, investment
allows the household to smooth the response of consumption and hours worked to a transitory
shock in susceptible people’s consumption demand.
Since a large part of the household wants to lower their consumption, the overall return
to working declines. So, there is a small initial fall in hours worked. After a delay, hours
worked then rise, reflecting the increase in the marginal product of labor associated with the
build up of capital.
In sum, when π 2 = 0, the epidemic generates a mild recession. But, with this parameterization the model cannot rationalize two key features of the COVID-19 recession: the large
drop in output and the positive comovement between investment and consumption.2
2

These declines in measures of economic activity occurred before lockdowns were imposed, as well as in
countries like Sweden and South Korea, and U.S. states that did not impose lockdowns (see Andersen et al.
(2020), Aum et al. (2020.) and Gupta et al. (2020)).

12

3.2

Epidemics as a shock to the supply of labor

To isolate the e§ect of the epidemic on the supply of labor, we set π 1 to zero. With this
assumption, consumption does not a§ect the probability of a susceptible person becoming
infected. We calibrate π 2 to 3.1871 × 10−4 so that 1/3 of the infections in the beginning of

the epidemic (equation (18)) are driven by hours worked.

Figure 3 displays the impact of an epidemic on key macro variables. The epidemic causes
a very large recession, with output and hours worked falling from peak to trough by 9 and
13 percent, respectively. Consumption declines modestly (0.7 percent from peak to trough)
and there is a large drop in investment (36 percent from trough to peak).
Figure 4 shows that cst , cit , and crt all decline by the same small amount. In contrast,
hours worked by di§erent types of people respond very di§erently: nst falls by 23 percent
from peak to trough, while both nit and nrt rise by 5 percent from trough to peak.
As discussed above, when π 1 = 0, the infection acts like a negative shock to susceptible
people’s supply of labor. The household cuts back on nst to reduce the probability of susceptible people becoming infected. Consistent with this logic, the reduction in nst mirrors the
path for It .
The household has an incentive to smooth consumption over time because consuming
does not increase anyone’s probability of becoming infected. Infected and recovered people
are not a§ected by exposure to the virus. So, to smooth consumption over time and across
people, the household increases nit and nrt .
The income of susceptible people falls dramatically. But their consumption does not,
so their savings turn sharply negative. The household finances that dissaving by a massive
decline in investment. In e§ect, investment allows the household to smooth consumption
and hours worked in response to a transitory fall in nst .
In sum, when π 1 = 0, the epidemic causes a large recession. But, with this parameterization the model cannot rationalize a key feature of the COVID-19 recession: the large
observed decline in consumption.

13

Epidemics as a shock to the demand for consumption and the
supply of labor

3.3

In our benchmark calibration, both π 1 and π 2 are positive. So an epidemic acts like a
negative shock to both consumption demand and labor supply.3
Figure 5 displays the total impact of the epidemic on key macro variables. With one
important caveat, the model captures the salient features of the epidemic recession. There
is a very large drop in output, consumption, and hours worked with peak to trough declines
of 5, 9 and 7 percent, respectively. Investment drops on impact by a modest 1 percent. It
then rebounds, peaking at 2 percent above its pre-epidemic steady state level. The caveat is
that, after an initial fall, investment rebounds and is above its steady-state level throughout
most of the epidemic.
Figure 6 displays consumption and hours worked for susceptible, infected and recovered
people, respectively. Again, these responses reflect the combined e§ects of a negative shock
to consumption demand and labor supply. Note that cst drops dramatically, reflecting the
importance of the negative shock to consumption demand. Also, nst drops dramatically,
reflecting the importance of the negative shock to susceptible people’s labor supply.
The behavior of investment reflects the combined e§ect of the household’s desire to
smooth cit and crt , and the negative shock to the demand for cst . These two e§ects work
in opposite directions, with investment initially falling but then rising in a hump-shaped
pattern. Compared to the single shock scenarios, the movements in investment are relatively
small.
Finally, Figure 6 shows that, after the epidemic runs its course, the economy converges to
a steady state where the real interest rate, per-capita output, consumption, investment, and
hours worked return to their respective pre-epidemic values. Since the population declines,
aggregate output, consumption, investment, and hours worked also decline, i.e. they do not
return to their pre-epidemic steady state values.

Monopolistic competition and flexible prices

In this section, we discuss the impact of an epidemic in the version of our model with
monopolistic competition (γ = 1.35) and flexible prices. We recalibrate the value of θ so

While this decomposition is useful for intuition, the quantitative impact is not the simple sum of the
two shocks given the nonlinear nature of the model.

that hours worked in the steady state are 28. Tables 1 and 2 display our parameter values
as well as the values of key aggregate steady-state variables.
In the steady state, the marginal cost is equal to 1/γ. Equation (15) implies that the real
rental rate of capital is independent of the markup. Since the marginal cost is a decreasing
function of γ, equation (8) implies that the real wage rate also falls for higher values of γ.
The steady-state real wage is 26.5 and 19.6 in the competitive and monopolistically competitive model, respectively. It turns out that this di§erence in the real wage has important
implications for the response of the economy to an epidemic.
Figures 7 and 8 show results for the case where the epidemic corresponds to a consumption
demand shock (π 2 = 0) and a labor-supply shock (π 1 = 0), respectively.
Figures 1 and 7 show that that the e§ects of the demand shock are very similar under
perfect and monopolistic competition. The main di§erence is that investment is more volatile
under monopolistic competition with a trough to peak increase of 50 percent as opposed to
33 percent under perfect competition.
Comparing Figures 3 and 8, we see that the qualitative e§ects of the supply shock are
very similar under perfect and monopolistic competition. But the quantitative di§erences
are larger than those pertaining to the demand shock. The drop in hours worked is much
larger under monopolistic competition with a peak to trough fall of 20 percent compared to
13 percent under perfect competition. The intuition is as follows. The steady-state real wage
is lower under monopolistic competition. So, equation (20) implies that, other things equal,
!
"
the impact of the infection term, λτt π 2 It NtI , on labor supply is larger under monopolistic

competition than under perfect competition. Basically, a lower real wage means that the

return to incurring infection risk from working is lower. So, the household reduces by more
the hours worked by susceptible people.
The larger fall in hours in the monopolistically competitive model translates into a larger
output fall. Since it is optimal for the household to smooth consumption, there is a large
fall in investment. Figures 3 and 8 show that the peak to trough fall in investment is 35 and
70 percent under perfect competition and monopolistic competition, respectively.
Figure 9 displays the total impact of the epidemic on key macro variables. This figure
shows that the model captures the salient features of the epidemic recession. There is a large
drop in output, consumption, investment, and hours worked with peak to trough declines of
7, 9, 7 and 10 percent, respectively. The drop in consumption reflects the fall in consumption
demand by susceptible people. The large fall in investment reflects the magnified importance
15

of the labor supply shock under monopolistic competition relative to perfect competition.
We conclude this section by corroborating our intuition about the way in which monopolistic competition magnifies the e§ect of the labor-supply shock on investment. The key to
that intuition is the lower value of the real wages under monopolistic competition.
To corroborate our intuition, we introduce a tax on labor income into the model with
perfect competition. Proceeds from this tax are rebated lump sum to the household. The
modified household budget constraint is given by
st cst + it cit + rt crt + xt + Ψt = wt (st nst + it nit + rt nrt )(1 − v) + Rtk kt + Φt ,
where the new element is the tax rate on labor income, v. The modified government budget
constraint is given by:
Ψt + vwt Nt = G.
Suppose that we set v = 0.259. Then, the steady-state wage rate is the same in the competitive and monopolistic competition models. As it turns out, the dynamic response of the
wage-tax perfect-competition model is very similar to the one that obtains under monopolistic competition.

New Keynesian model

We now consider the e§ects of an epidemic in a simple New Keynesian model with sticky
prices. This model di§ers from the version of the neoclassical model with monopolistic
competition by assuming that intermediate goods producers are subject to nominal price
rigidities.
Households The only change to the household problem pertains to the budget constraint.
We write this constraint in nominal terms and include a one-period riskless bond:
!
"
!
"
b
Bt + Wt st nst + it nit + rt nrt + Rtk kt + Φt . (21)
Bt+1 + Pt st cst + it cit + rt crt + xt + Ψ = Rt−1

Here, Bt nominal bond holdings, Rtb the interest rate on nominal bonds, Wt is the nominal
wage rate, Rtk is the nominal rental price, and Pt is the consumer price index.
The household maximizes lifetime utility, (9), subject to the budget constraint, (21),

the law of motion for capital, (10), and the equations that govern the health status of the
household’s members, (11), (12), (13), and (14). The first-order conditions for consumption,
hours worked, kt+1 st+1 , it+1 , rt+1 , and τ t are described in the appendix.

where Ytf is output in a flexible-price version of the economy. The government budget

Equilibrium The equilibrium conditions are the same as in the flexible price model with
one addition. Since nominal bonds are in zero net supply, in equilibrium:
Bt = 0.
We summarize the model’s equilibrium conditions in the appendix.

5.1

The impact of an epidemic in the New Keynesian model

We assume that ξ = 0.98 so that prices change on average once a year. The coe¢cients in
the Taylor rule are θπ = 1.5 and θx = 0.5/52.
Figure 10 displays the dynamics of key macro aggregates in the New Keynesian model
(blue-solid line). For ease of comparison, the figure also displays the dynamics of the monopolistically competitive economy with flexible prices (red-dashed line). The latter is a special
case of the new Keynesian model where ξ = 0.
The main results can be summarized as follows. First, sticky prices increase the depth
of the recession but only marginally so. This result is not entirely surprising given that an
epidemic is both a demand and a supply shock. In New Keynesian models, sticky prices
generally exacerbate the e§ects of a negative demand shock and alleviate the impact of
negative supply shocks. Putting these two e§ects together, we would not expect sticky
prices to have a strong impact on the response of output to an epidemic. Second, in contrast
to the flexible price model, investment falls by more than consumption. Third, regardless of
whether prices are sticky or flexible, the epidemic reduces the inflation rate relative to the
steady state. But inflation drops by about half as much in the new Keynesian model.
On net, sticky prices amplify the severity of the recession while leading to a muted
response of the inflation rate.

Related literature

There is by now a very large literature on the macroeconomic impact of epidemics. A
large strand of this literature studies the impact of lockdowns and other mitigation policies.
See e.g., Alvarez, Argente, and Lippi (2020), Buera, Fattal-Jaef, Neumeyer, and Shin (2020),
Eichenbaum, Rebelo and Trabandt (2020a,b), Farboodi, Jarosch, and Shimer (2020), Glover,
Gonzalez-Eiras and Niepelt (2020), Heathcote, Krueger, and Rios-Rull (2020), Krueger,
Uhlig, and Xie (2020), Piguillem and Shi (2020), and Toxvaerd (2020).
In contrast to this body of work, this paper focuses on the endogenous business cycle
dynamics associated with an epidemic in models with capital accumulation and monopolist
competition with and without sticky prices. In this section, we discuss the papers that are
most closely related to our work.
Guerrieri, Lorenzoni, Straub, and Werning (2020) study how, in the presence of sticky
prices, supply shocks can trigger changes in aggregate demand that are larger than the initial
18

supply shocks. In contrast with Guerrieri et al. (2020), we incorporate investment and an
explicit model of epidemics into our analysis.
Faria-e-Castro (2020) studies the impact of a negative demand shock on consumption
modeled as a negative shock to the utility of consumption. In our model, the negative
demand shock arises from the nature of the epidemic. In addition, the focus of our analysis
is on the relative importance of negative shifts in aggregate demand and supply for the
behavior of macroeconomic aggregates during an epidemic.
Bodenstein, Corsetti, and Guerrieri (2020) study a multi-sector model of epidemics with
capital accumulation. In their model, the supply of labor is exogenous but an infection
reduces the number of people who go to work. This decline in employment can compromise essential linkages in production, thus exacerbating the social costs of an epidemic. In
contrast with Bodenstein et al. (2020), in our analysis labor supply is endogenous and the
transmission of the virus depends on people’s decisions about labor supply and consumption.
Jones, Philippon, and Venkateswaran (2020) study optimal mitigation policies in a model
where economic activity and epidemic dynamics interact. In contrast to those authors,
we allow for capital accumulation as well as sticky prices. Also, our analysis focuses on
understanding the comovement between output, consumption and investment during an
epidemic.

7

Conclusion

We analyze the e§ects of an epidemic in three standard macroeconomic models. Our main
conclusions are as follows. The neoclassical model does not rationalize the positive comovement of consumption and investment observed in recessions associated with an epidemic.
Introducing monopolistic competition into the neoclassical model remedies this shortcoming
even when prices are completely flexible. Finally, sticky prices lead to a larger recession but
do not fundamentally alter the predictions of the monopolistic competition model.
In our analysis, we abstract from financial frictions and the zero lower bound constraint
on interest rates. Allowing for these considerations is a natural next step which would
allow us to evaluate the myriad of policy interventions implemented during the COVID-19
epidemic.
