APPLICATION OF NATIONALITYADJUSTED NET SALES AND VALUE
ADDED FRAMEWORK: THE CASE
OF JAPAN

ABSTRACT
This paper applies the nationality-adjusted

net sales and value added framework proposed

in Baldwin and Kimura (1996) to Japan. Despite possibly large estimation errors due to statistical
deficiencies, the framework is very useful for analyzing the relationship of the Japanese economy
to the world economy. We find that Japan is special in the following four aspects. First, Japaneseowned firms have become increasingly

dependent on the marketing activities of their foreign

affiliates, rather than depending on cross-border exports by parent firms located in Japan. Second,
the much smaller activities of Japanese affiliates of foreign firms (JAFF) relative to those of foreign
affiliates of Japanese firms (FAJF) are apparent in terms of sales, value added, and employment,

at

both the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. Third, Japanese net sales to foreigners are consistently
larger than cross-border net exports of Japan. Fourth, among the activities of FAJF, the importance
of commercial FAJF is particularly large; these commercial FAJF handle a large portion of Japanese
exports and imports.
The paper concludes by discussing a number of statistical improvements

required by the

Japanese government in order to apply our analytical framework more rigorously.

I. Introduction
In the companion paper for the United States (Baldwin andKimura(1996)),
a nationality-adjusted

we propose

net sales and value-added framework and apply it to United States data

in order to show its usefulness in analyzing a number of current economic issues and to specify
points for statistical improvements.

The framework should eventually be expanded to an

internationally integrated statistical system that captures the entire activities of multinational
enterprises in the world. As a preliminary effort, this paper applies the framework to Japan.
The proposed framework analyzes the globalization
viewpoint.

a framework

consistent with GDP or national accounts statistics. 1 Since the BOP format primarily follows
the residency

of economic agents, the value added of foreign affiliates is conceptually

decomposed into a residents’ portion and a nonresidents’ portion, with the latter portion being
captured as investment income (including retained earnings). Thus, the BOP framework is not
very convenient in analyzing the behavior of globalized firms’. Merchandise

transactions between parent companies and affiliates may be qualitatively different from usual
transactions between domestic firms and foreign firms. A firm may have its own resources for
competitiveness,

such as firm-specific technologies and managerial abilities, that can be used

both inside and outside of the home country.

Furthermore,

even if a firm has multiple

across the world, it may make managerial decisions jointly.

Our proposed

3
framework assigns nationalities to firms and treats each firm as an individual entity. By doing
so, we can analyze the competitiveness
foreign-controlled

of firms in international markets, the importance of

affiliates in a national economy, firms’ decisions on whether to export or to

invest abroad, and other related issues.

These features of firms’ activities are particularly

important in the case of Japan where firms’ activities have been rapidly globalized.
Although Japan is one of the few countries that collect extensive operational data on
inward and outward direct foreign investment (DFI), we still encounter a number of problems
in applying the framework.

We try to identifi explicitly various statistical deficiencies in the

available data and relate them to the proposed statistical format.
possible estimation

However, despite large

errors, we believe that the framework is very useful for analyzing the

relationship of the Japanese economy to the world economy. Our analysis cofilrms the oftenclaimed asymmetry between inward and outward DFI of Japan. We also find a rapid expansion
of Japanese firms’ activities abroad that exceeds the expansion of exports.

In addition, we

show that the activities of commercial affiliates of Japanese firms abroad, particularly those of
general trading companies, play an important role in Japanese international transactions.

II. Data on sales and purchases by affiliates
A MITI data set (hereinafter referrerd to as “the old FAJF series”) is the only currentlyavailable source for time-series data on the sales and purchases of foreign affiliates of Japanese
firms

(FAJF).

The International

Enterprises

Section

of MITI

annually

distributes

questionnaires to parent Japanese companies that are identified by the Foreign Exchange and
Foreign Trade Control Law as having foreign affiliates with more than a 10% share.2 A
detailed survey was initiated in 1980 and has been conducted every three years since 1983. A
shortened questionnaire is used in the other years. Among the particularly useful information
collected is data on purchases by FAJF (such data are not collected in the U.S. surveys of
foreign direct investment).3

This survey, however, is so-called shounin toukei, which means

“approved statistics, ” and it is not legally mandatory for firms to fill in the questionnaire.
Therefore, the data are much less reliable than the U.S. data.
coverage.

A serious problem is low

For example, in 1992, only 65. 5°/0 of the questionnaires

sent to foreign affiliates

were returned to MITI. Moreover, not all firms returning the questionnaire answered all of the
questions. To make matters worse, MITI does not report the number of firms that answered
each question,

This problem is particularly serious for purchases data. In addition, not all

firms that provide total sales or purchases data report by-destination disaggregation of sales or
by-origin disaggregation of purchases.
The Research and Statistics Department

of the Minister’s Secretariat of MITI has

recently begun to publish another statistical series covering FAJF. This survey called the Basic
Survey of Business Structure and Activity (hereinafter “the new FAJF series”), collects data
on FAJF as a part of information obtained on private firms’ activities in Japan. The new series

5
is so-called shitei toukei, which means “designated statistics,” and therefore companies have
a legal obligation

to return completed

questionnaires.

The survey was scheduled to be

conducted anntily

beginning in 1995. Since the figures for the 1991 financial year were not

published until December 1994, we have figures for only one year thus far. Table 1 presents
the 1991 financial year data on the activities of FAJF from the two sources, the old and new
FAJF series, The new FAJF series provides more reliable figures than the old FAJF series, but
the coverage is narrower and bimed toward large companies,4
Data on Japanese

affiliates

of foreign

firms (JAFF)

are also reported

by the

International Enterprises Section of MITI. The structure of this survey is basically the same
as that of the old FAJF survey,

The coverage is, however, even narrower;

financial year, for instance, only 53.7% of the questionnaires

for the 1992

were returned to MITI.5

Another difference between the MITI and BEA data is that the former data set does not
report sales of goods and services separately.
International

In ptiicular,

the questionnaire

by the

Enterprises Section of MITI does not explicitly speci~ sales and purchases as

“sales and purchases of goods and services” so that we are not sure if firms report services
transactions. Therefore, in our estimations, we tentatively use merchandise trade (not including
services trade) for cross-border trade data.

III. Estimation of aggregate net sales
(1) Defining nationalities
MITI’s old FAJF series defines foreign affiliates of Japanese firms (FAJF) as firms in
which Japanese have more than a 10°/0share and majority-owned

affiliates as firms in which

6
Japanese have more than a 50% share.
majority-owned

For our purposes, it is better to use the data for

affiliates, but they are not available in time series forrn.c

Thus, we define

FAJF m firms in which Japanese have more than a 10% share. This may cause considerable
measurement

errors, particularly since it is a common practice for general Japanese trading

companies to participate in a joint venture between Japanese and foreign companies as a third
party with a minor share. For inward DFI, MITI’s JAFF series defined Japanese affiliates of
foreign firms (JAFF) as majority-owned affiliates until the 1990 financial year and as tilliates
with more than one-third shares in the 1991 and 1992 financial years.
As in the case of the United States, we do not have data on sales and purchases by
foreign citizens in Japan and those by Japanese living abroad.

It is therefore necessary to

and Japanese government units.

Similarly, the term, “foreigners,” consists of

foreign-owned firms in Japan and abroad, households of foreign and Japanese citizens residing
abroad (foreign-resident

households), and foreign governments.

(2) Estimates of net sales of Japanese to foreigners
Table 2 presents estimates of the net sales of Japanese to foreigners for 1987-1992. The
table consists of(I) cross-border sales to and purchases from foreigners by Japanese, (II) sales
to and purchases from foreigners by FAJF, and (III) Japanese sales to and purchases from JAFF
(also see Figure 1),

7
In Part I, Japanese

cross-border

sales (exports)

to foreigners

are estimated

by

subtracting the sum of Japanese exports shipped to FAJF and Japanese exports shipped by
JAFF from cross-border exports of Japan valued on an f.o.b. basis. The estimate of such crossborder sales (exports) in 1987, for example, is 11,714 billion yen, which is much smaller than
Japan’s cross-border exports of 33,315 billion yen.
Quite aside from the above-mentioned coverage problem, the 11,714 billion yen figure
is, for several reasons, still ordy an approximate estimate. The most serious problem is that the
figure for Japanese exports shipped to FAJF (20,571 billion yen) is a very rough estimate.
Among FAJF reporting the total amount of purchases are many that do not provide purchase
figures disaggregated by origin, i.e., a considerable portion of FAJF do not report separately
local purchases, purchases from Japan, and purchases from third countries.

In 1987, for

example, ordy 38.4°/0 of total purchases by FAJF can be disaggregated by origin. We, hence,
first calculate the ratio of purchmes from Japan to total purchases for firms in each sector
reporting purchases by origin. Then we multiply that ratio by total purchases by all firms in
the sector and sum up all sectors’ estimates of purchases from Japan. Another potential
estimation problem concerns the treatment of purchases by FAJF from commercial

FAJF.

When an FAJF in the commercial sector imports intermediate goods and sells them to a noncommercial FAJF, both the commercial and non-commercial

FAJF may treat these purchases

as purchases from abroad. This means that the purchases ratios from Japan (and those from
third countries) may be overstated to some extent. The estimation of purchases by FAJF from
Japan or Japanese exports shipped to FAJF (20,571 billion yen) in 1987, may therefore differ
from the true figure.

In addition, exports by JAFF to FAJF are subtracted twice in this

8
calculation

since they are included in both Japanese exports shipped to FAJF and Japanese

exports shipped by JAFF. This, however, probably does not affect our estimates very much.7
The lower half of Part I of Table 2 shows our estimates of Japanese cross-border
purchases (imports) from foreigners, namely, 9,622 billion yen in 1987. These are again much
smaller than cross-border imports (21,737 billion yen). They are calculated by subtracting the
sum of Japanese imports shipped by FAJF and Japanese imports shipped to JAFF from
Japanese cross-border

imports valued on a c.i.f. basis.

Again, the estimates of Japanese

imports shipped by FAJF or sales to Japan by FAJF (9,294 billion yen) may contain large
errors. Since a large portion of FAJF do not report by-destination disaggregation of their sales
(to the local market, to Japan, or to third countries),

sales by FAJF to Japan are estimated by

calculating the ratio of sales to Japan to total sales for each industrial sector, multiplying this
ratio by total sales of the sector, and summing up all sectors’ estimates of sales to Japan.
Again, the ratios of sales to Japan to total sales maybe overstated due to double-counting

in

the transaction through commercial FAJF. In addition, Japanese imports from FAJF shipped
to JAFF are subtracted twice.*
By subtracting 9,622 billion yen from 11,714 billion yen, we obtain Japanese net crossborder sales to foreigners, 2,093 billion yen in 1987. Our estimates are consistently smaller
than the cross-border trade balance, except in 1992.
Part II of Table 2 presents estimates of sales to and purchases of FAJF to and from
foreigners.

To obtain sales of FAJF to foreigners (42,160 billion yen in 1987), we subtract

from their total sales both sales among themselves

and their sales to Japan.

Data on sales

among FAJF are not available. However, intra-group sales of FAJF to local makets and third

9
countries, which are a part of sales among FAJF, can be estimated. The old FAJF series for the
years 1989 and 1992 give shares of intra-group sales of FAJF (to local markets, to Japan, and
to third countries) to total sales of FAJF for each sector, By multiplying

each sector’s total

sales by these shares and adding them across sectors, we obtain proxies for sales among FAJF.
Since these shares are available only for 1989 and 1992, the 1989 shares me used for 19871988 and 1990-1991. The other term to be subtracted, Japanese imports shipped by FAJF, may
contain a large error, as discussed above.
Purchases of FAJF from foreigners abroad (23,950 billion yen in 1987) are calculated
by subtracting from their total purchases both purchases from other FAJF and Japanese exports
shipped to FAJF. Data on purchases by FAJF are directly available, which is an advantageous
feature of the Japanese statistics compared with the U.S. BEA statistics.
purchases from other FAJF by FAJF, is not directly available.

The next term,

We use intra-group sales of

FAJF to local and third countries, estimated above, as a proxy.9

The other terms to be

subtracted, Japanese exports shipped to FAJF, may contain large estimation errors for the
above-mentioned reasons. Our estimation of net sales by FAJF to foreigners is 23,950 billion
yen for 1987.
Part III of Table 2 presents the estimates of net sales of Japanese to JAFF, which were
-5,927 billion yen in 1987. Again, the JAFF series published by MITI directly provide data
on purchases by JAFF. Sales among JAFF, however, are not available.

We thus calculate

Japanese sales to JAFF (3,464 billion yen in 1987) by subtracting Japanese imports shipped
to JAFF from total purchases by JAFF. Japanese purchases from JAFF (9,391 billion yen in
1987) are obtained by subtracting Japanese exports shipped by JAFF from total sales by JAFF.

10

By summing up these three components, we obtain estimates of net sales to foreigners
by Japanese, for example, 20,116 billion yen in 1987.

and imports, while Japanese exports and imports through FAJF are 6 1.7°/0 and 42. So/Oof total

FAJF could

contain large errors, but we can still infer that Japan depends on its foreign affiliates in export

in the commercial

sector are particularly important. According to our estimates, Japanese

11
exports and imports through commercial FAJF amounted to 48 .2°/0and36 .OO/O
of total Japanese
exports and imports in 1987, We discuss commercial FAJF further in Section V.

(3) Estimates of value added by FAJF and JAFF
The same data set as we used in constructing Table 2, can also be utilized to estimate
value added by FAJF and JAFF.

Since the old FAJF and JAFF series published by MITI

directly report total sales and purchmes by FAJF and FAFF, value added can be calculated by
simply subtracting total purchases from total sales, Strictly speaking, we need to take into
consideration such factors as depreciation, indirect taxes, and changes in inventory stock, but
data on these variables are not available. Table 3 and Figure 2 present our estimates.

The

format of the table and the figure follows our companion paper for the United States.
Table 3 also reports ratios of value added by FAJF to value added by all Japaneseowned firms, the latter being defined as Japanese GDP plus value added by FAJF minus value
added by JAFF, and ratios of value added by JAFF to the GDP of Japan.’2

firms increased during the period,

but the figures of 8.33% and 7.87% for 1991 and 1992 maybe overstated due to an unusually
low purchases

figure compared with the corresponding

sales figure.]3

We can, however,

conclude that Japanese firms have increased the extent of production abroad and have roughly
reached the same degree of internationalization

of activities as U.S. firms have. As reported

in our companion paper, the ratio of value added by FAUSF to that of U. S-owned firms ranges
from 5 to 6

Yo.

The ratio of value added by JAFF to Japanese GDP, in contrast, is generally

only a little larger than 10/O. The asymmetry between the behavior of FAJF and JAFF is

12
obvious.
The proportion of foreign activities by Japanese firms is ofien measured by the foreign
production ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the value of production of FAJF to total
domestic production.

The figure for the manufacturing

sector in the 1993 fiscal year, for

example, is estimated as 6.4°/0 by MITI (1994, p. 46). The value of production, however,
includes the value of intermediate inputs and thus is not appropriate for measuring the size of
economic activities in Japan and abroad. Our value added method is conceptually better for
indicating

the proportion

of foreign activities of Japanese firms although it may contain

considerable measurement errors due to the quality of data,

(4) Comparison of exports and DFI on a value added basis
In other empirical studies, firms’ choice between exports and DFI is usually captured
by comparing basically incomparable figures, namely, exports and DFI flows. Our value added
method makes it possible to compare directly two ways by which firms can sell their products
to foreigners abroad: by producing domestically and exporting or by producing abroad and
selling there.
Following the companion paper for the United States, we calculate Japanese value
added figures in exports of Japanese-owned

firms.

They are usefil

in comparing

the

proportion of Japanese firms’ sales activities to foreigners through cross-border transactions
and through the activities of FAJF. To obtain the estimates, we subtract exports by FAJF from
total cross-border exports and then subtract the import component in the remaining exports. 14
In Japan, input-output

tables are presented in the non-competitive-import

form and hence

13
directly provide the import inducement coefficient of exports or the direct and indirect import
content of exports. This was 10.36°/0 in 1990. By using this figure for 1987-1992, Japanese
value added in exports of Japanese-owned

firms can be calculated. This amounted to 28,941

billion yen in 1987, for example. Out of the 28,941 billion yen, 10,501 billion yen is the value
added in exports by Japanese firms located in Japan to foreigners abroad.

This figure is

directly compmable with the 10,384 billion yen of value added in the goods and services sold
by FAJF to foreigners,

There are two ways for Japanese firms to sell their products to

foreigners: by producing in Japan and exporting or producing abroad and selling there. The
comparison

between 10,501 billion yen and 10,384 billion yen provides a clear idea of the

relative importance of these two marketing methods. Compared with the same figures for the
United States reported in Baldwin and Kimura (1996), transactions

by Japanese foreign

affiliates are more important, due mainly to the large ratio of exports by FAJF to total exports.
Even after discounting

the large estimates of

value added by FAJF in 1991 and 1992,

transactions by FAJF seem to be becoming more important over time.

firms is estimated in a similar

Because input-output tables for the rest of the world are not available, the figure for

Japan, 10.36%, is tentatively used.

The estimate of value added in exporting countries by

foreign-owned firms abroad is 11,154 billion yen in 1987. Out of this, value added in foreign
exports to Japanese in Japan is 8,625 billion yen. This figure can be directly compared with
3,727 billion yen, which is the value added in goods and services sold by JAFF to Japanese in
Japan. The importance of transactions through JAFF seems to be becoming smaller overtime.

14
IV. Estimation of sectoral net sales
(1) Sectoral net sales
In this section, we estimate nationality-based net sales by individual industrial sectors.
We believe that they provide a better idea of firms’ international competitiveness
by technological

determined

know-how and managerial ability than cross-border net exports do.

A problem arising in sectoral matching of DFI figures and trade statistics is that affdiate
data are classified by industries while cross-border trade data are classified by commodities.
This difference leads to a serious problem, particularly in the treatment of the commercial
sector. We therefore estimate net sales only for the manufacturing
Nationality-adjusted

sector.

sales for individual sectors are calculated as follows:

Nationality-adjusted

sales = Japan’s cross-border exports

+ sales by FAJF + purchases by JAFF - Japan’s exports shipped to FAJF
- Japan’s imports shipped by FAJF - sales to other FAJF by FAJF
- Japan’s exports shipped by JAFF - Japan’s imports shipped to JAFF.
On the other hand, nationality-adjusted
Nationality-adjusted

purchases for individual sectors are defined as

purchases = Japan’s cross-border imports

+ sales by JAFF + purchases by FAJF - Japan’s exports shipped to FAJF
- Japan’s imports shipped by FAJF - purchases from other FAJF by FAJF
- Japan’s exports shipped by JAFF - Japan’s imports shipped to JAFF.
Nationality-adjusted

net sales are calculated by subtracting nationality-adjusted

nationality-adjusted

sales. We assume that each industry purchases intermediate inputs only

from their own industry, since the data of sectoral purchases by industrial

but should roughly

hold for the

net sales of an individual industrial sector then

become equivalent to cross-border net sales (exports) plus value added by FAW minus value
added by JAFF for the sector. By following this estimation procedure, possible estimation
errors in by-destination

sales and by-origin purchases by FAJF and JAFF are canceled out in

the calculation. 15
Table 4 presents cross-border net sales, nationality-adjusted

net sales, and their ratios

to the corresponding total sales (of all firms in Japan or of all Japanese-owned
consistent

with the macroeconomic

firms). To be

figures, we use sectoral data on the value of output (in

producer prices) obtained from the national account statistics as a proxy of the total sales of all
firms in Japan.lb

The figures for aggregate cross-border net sales are slightly different from

those for the cross-border merchandise trade balance shown in Table 2, because the former are
based on United Nations data reported in U.S. dollars, while the latter are from the Japan
Statistical Yearbook reported in yen, The other data are taken directly from the FAJF and
JAFF series published by MITI.

and

However, whereas the ratios of nationality-

adjusted net sales to total sales have increased since 1989, those of cross-border ones have not
changed much. This suggests that the international competitiveness of Japanese manufacturing
firms has increased, while that of firms in territorial Japan hm not. We again have to note
reservation about the 1991-1992 figures, however. As for sectoral patterns, large positive net
sales, both cross-border and nationality-adjusted,

are found in general machinery, electrical

16
machinery, transport equipment, and precision machinery, and negative net sales are shown
for food processing, textiles, chemicals (except nationality-adjusted

net sales in 1992), and

and coal products.

The ratios of nationality-adjusted

sometimes exhibit significant sudden changes, for example, textiles in 1989 and petroleum and
coal products in 1992, even though the ratios of cross-border net sales to total sales do not
change appreciably. Such jumps are mainly caused by drastic increases in sectoral value added
by FAJF.

(2) Sectoral significance of FAJF and JAFF
The macroeconomic significance of the activities of FAJF and JAFF have already been
discussed.

The sectoral importance of the activities of FAJF and JAFF can be obtained by

using sectoral data on output, value added, and employment in the Japanese national accounts
statistics.

Table 5 presents shares of FAJF in Japanese-owned

firms (firms in Japan minus

JAFF plus FAJF) and shares of JAFF in firms in Japan in terms of sales, value added, and
employment.
Although there are some irregular up-and-downs partly due to the sampling problem,
the figures still provide useful information for analyzing differences in the relative importance
of FAJF and JAFF across manufacturing subsectors and across time. The value added shares
are particularly useful for comparative purposes. The major findings are as follows:
value added share of FAJF in Japanese-owned

firms for the total manufacturing

first, the
sector

increased from 3.76°/0in 1987 to 8.57°/0in 1990, and then to 10.76°/0 by 1992. The importance
of the activities of foreign affiliates for Japanese-owned

manufacturing

firms does not appear

17
to be as extensive as for U.S.-owned firms but has been increasing. We again need to discount
the figures for 1991 and 1992, however. The share of JAFF in the activities of all firms in
Japan has been low and nearly constant.

The asymmetry of inward and outward DFI is also

apparent at the sectoral level.
Second, industries of comparative advantage for Japan, such as electrical machinery and
transport

equipment,

have rapidly increased the ratio of value added in FAJF to that in

Japanese-owned firms. In 1992, the ratios were as high as 17.29% and 29.66V0 for electrical
machinery and trmsport equipment.

The value added shares of JAFF to firms in Japan, in

contrast, started from a low level in 1987 and still remained low in 1992, e.g., 5.09 °/0 and
0.69% in these sectors. The value added shares of FAJF to Japanese-owned

firms have also increased.

The share of

JAFF to firms in Japan also increased in the chemical industry. Large outward and inward DFI
characterizes the chemical indust~ in the cme of the United States, and the Japanese chemical
industry seems to behave in the same manner.

V. Commercial FA~

and the presence of general trading companies

A special feature of foreign affiliates of Japanese firms is the large presence of
commercial FAJF in the commercial sector, particularly in the wholesale trade sector. Table

18
6 presents the Japan-U.S. comparison of manufacturing and commercial affiliates in 1991. The
table classifies industries both for parent companies and for foreign affiliates.

FAJF in the

wholesale trade sector have 75°/0and 56°/0shares in all FAJF in terms of sales and value added,
while FAUSF (foreign affiliates of U.S. firms) in the wholesale

trade sector (excluding

petroleum wholesale trade) have shares of 18% and 12%.’7 Although the figures for FAUSF
would become larger by including wholesale petroleum trade, the figures for FAJF are still
much larger than those for FAUSF. FAJF in the wholesale trade sector are also characterized
by high value added per employee compared with FAUSF.
Table 6 also shows an interesting contrast between figures breed on the industry
classification of parent companies and those based on the classification of affiliates. In the cme
of FAUSF, we see that most of FAUSF in the wholesale trade sector have parent companies
in non-wholesale-trade

sectors.

This means that a major function of wholesale FAUSF is

undertaking foreign marketing operations for manufacturing parent companies. In contrast, in
the cme of FAJF, about a half of FAJF in the wholesale trade sector have parent companies in
the wholesale trade sector. This suggests that general trading companies (GTCS) play a large
role in Japanese international transactions.
A special study conducted by the Japan Foreign Trade Council presents data for sales
by the “major branches” of the nine largest Japanese GTCs.lg

The “major branches” are

defined as foreign affiliates of GTCS that have close contacts with the Japanese headquarters
and organize local activities.

The sample covered 197 affiliates in 37 countries. Table 7

presents the sales figures. Although we have some reservations on the quality of these data,
particularly

because of double-counting

of transactions among the firms, the significance of

19
GTCS’ activities is apparent. The sales to Japan by the GTC major branches have a 98V0 share
in those by commercial FAJF in our estimates.

The same share in terms of the sales to third

countries is 105°/0. These shares are, of course, subject to estimation errors, but they clearly
indicate that the presence of GTCS in international transactions of commercial FAJF is large.

VI. Concluding

remarks

In this paper, we applied our nationality-based net sales and value added framework to
Japanese

data.

Foreign production

activities of Japanese firms have been increasingly

important, and the nationality-based net sales estimates proved to be useful in analyzing firms
international activities. Our value added accounting also provides an integrated framework for
analyzing both exports and activities of foreign affiliates and thereby in understanding

key

characteristics of the Japanese economy.
We found that Japan is special in the following four aspects.

First, Japanese-owned

firms have become increasingly dependent on the marketing activities of their foreign tilliates
(FAJF), rather than depending on cross-border

exports by parent firms located in Japan.

Second, the asymmetry between inward and outward DFI is apparent in terms of sales, value
added, and employment, at both the macroeconomic
sales to foreigners are consistently

and sectoral levels. Third, Japanese net

larger than cross-border net exports of Japan.

Fourth,

among the activities of FAJF, the importance of commercial FAJF is particularly large, with
these commercial

affiliates handling a large portion of Japanese exports and imports.

Our

statistical framework is useful for identifying these characteristics.
To apply

are required.

First, MITI or the Government

of Japan must develop an

surveys do. Adding questions on sales among affiliates will help apply our method more
precisely. Third, we need to develop a proper statistical framework to capture the activities of
commercial FAJF. Possible double-counting

in the sales to or purchases from Japan or third

countries by FAJF must be corrected. In addition, possible double-counting
definition of FAJF must be eliminated..

ENDNOTES
1. The BOP framework determines the residency of individuals and firms by whether or not they
reside in a country for one year or more (in the IMF version of the BOP manual;

in the Japanese

version, more than two years for Japanese abroad and more than six months for foreigners in Japan).
This means that, for example, a U.S. affiliate of a Japanese firm established more than a year ago
is treated as American. Hence, merchandise and services trade is basically captured as transactions
between economic agents in different geographical locations, rather than between economic agents
with different nationalities.
2. One of the problems of this list of enterprises is that there is no systematic procedure for updating
the list. It therefore may include enterprises or foreign affiliates which once existed but are not in
business anymore.
3, BEA (Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce) tried to collect purchases
data in the past, but it deleted the question from the questionnaire because it could not collect reliable
figures.
4. The new FAJF series can be used for checking the accuracy of the old FAJF series. For the 1991
financial year data, for example, one may question the quality of sales and purchases data reported
by the old FAJF series, which differ widely from those in the new FAJ F series. MITI is currently
trying to reformulate the formats of the old and new FAJF series into an integrated framework.
5. Again, one of the problems is that there is no systmatic procedure to update the list of JAFF.
MITI is currently trying to integrate the JAFF series and domestic establishment smeys.
is promoting this approach with a number of countries, including the UK and France.
6. The definition of FAJF in the new FAJF series is “majority-owned.”

The OECD

26
7. Possible errors listed in this paragraph do not affect our estimation of Japanese net sales to
foreigners shown in Part IV of Table 2. As Lois Steckler of the Board of Governors points out in
personal correspondence, Japanese net sales to foreigners are conceptually equivalent to cross-border
net exports plus FAJF’s value added (sales minus purchases) minus JAFF’s value added (sales minus
purchases).

The possible error terms are canceled out in the calculation of Japanese net sales to

foreigners.
8. These possible errors do not affect our estimation of Japanese net sales to foreigners.
9. Intra-group purchases from local and third countries can be estimated in a symmetric manner.
However, the estimates differ from intra-group sales to local and third countries, though these must
be equivalent in principle.
10. The estimate of nationality-adjusted

sales of 1988 is particularly small, while those of 1991 and

1992 look very large. This fluctuation is mainly due to changes in the value added by FAJF, which
may contain large estimation errors. We, however, can at least conclude that the activities of JAFF
expanded until 1990.
11. The decline in the estimated ratio on the export side for 1992 maybe due to the understatement
of purchases by FAJF.
12. Value added by Japanese-owned firms as well as Japanese GDP includes production that takes
place outside firms, such as in the government and household sectors.
13. As mentioned in Footnote 5 of Table 1, the 1991 data of sales and purchases provided by the
new FAJF series suggest much smaller value added by FAJF. The ratios of value added by FAJF
to sales under the old FAJF series in Table 3 also look too large for 1991 and 1992. This maybe due
to the small number of FAJF providing purchases figures,

though this cannot be proven from

27
published documents.
14. Precisely speaking, we must consider the JAFF component in these exports to avoid doublecounting, but the data are not available.
15. The sector matching list between our industry (commodity) classification

and SITC Rev. 2 is

available upon request.
16. Alternatively,

we can use sales data of “Financial Statements of Corporations

by Industry” by

the Ministry of Finance or value of shipments data of “Census of Manufactures” collected by MITI,
though figures widely differ mairdy due to the difference in coverage and the definition of firms or
establishments.
17. It should be noted that FAJF do not include affiliates (or parent companies) in the finance,
insurance, and real estate sectors, while FAUSF do include affiliates (or parent companies) in the
finance (excluding banking), insurance, and real estate sectors. We should also take into account
that affiliates in the service sector have a larger share in the case of FAUSF than in the cme of FAJF.
18. The nine largest Japanese GTCS are C. Itoh, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Nissho
Iwai, Tomen, Nichimen, and Kanematsu Gosho. The study by the Japan Foreign Trade Council
covers only the financial years 1983 and 1987.

Japanese exports shipped to FAJF --- One of the shortfalls of the old FAJF series is that firms in the
sample report total purchases while many of them fail to report the by-origin disaggregation.
For example, out
of total purchases in 1987 (42,135,754),
only 38,4°/0 (16,189,035)
are disaggregated
into local purchases
(5,880,385), purchases horn Japan (7,72 1,739), and purchases from third countries (2,586,91 1). We therefore
estimate Japanese exports shipped to FAJF as the sum of sectoral estimates, each of which is derived horn
multiplying total purchases of the sector by the shine of purchases from Japan of the sector (calculated from the
limited sample), 0LD87/88 (pp. 94-95, 202-203), 89 (pp. 222-223),90

Japanese importsshipped by FAJF --- As in Japanese exports shipped to FAJF, firms in the sample
report total sales while many of them fail to report the by-destination disaggregation.
For example, out of total
sales in 1987 (54,808,975), only 42.2°/0 (23,144,497) are disaggregated
into local sales (15,388,102), sales to
Japan (3,770,459), and sales to third countries (3,985,936).
We therefore estimate Japanese imports shipped by
FAJF as the sum of sectoral estimates, each of which is derived from multiplying total sales of the sector by the
share of sales to Japan of the sector (calculated from the limited sample). 0LD87/88 (pp. 82-83, 190-191), 89

Sales to other FAJF --- Although the data of sales among FAJF are not available, inba-firm transaction
between affiliates can be estimated. For 1989, by using the same method as in estimating Japanese imports from
FAJF, we first estimate local sales and sales to third countries of each sector. Then, by multiplying ratios of
intra-group sales in local sales and sales to third countries of each sector, we can estimate intra-firm trade of the
sector. The sum of sectoral estimates provides a proxy of sales to other FAJF, For 1987, 88, 90, and 91, ratios
of intra-~oup sales in 1989 are used. 0LD87/88 (pp. 82-83, 190-191), 89 (pp. 210-211, 229), 90 Q. 88-89), 91
