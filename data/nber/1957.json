    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper reviews recent work on the relationship between industrial\norganization and international trade. Five strands in the theoretical\nliterature are discussed. First is the role of economies of scale\nas a cause of intra-industry trade, modelled using monopolistic competition.\nSecond is the effect of tariffs and quotas on domestic market\npower. Third is the analysis of dumping as international price discrimination.\nFourth is the potential strategy role of government policy as an\naid to domestic firms in oligopolistic competition. Finally, the paper\ndiscusses recent work that may provide a new argument for protectionism.\nA concluding section discusses recent efforts at quantification of new\ntrade theory.\n\n",
