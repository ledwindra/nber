ABSTRACT
We explore a key underlying assumption, the exclusion restriction, commonly used in interpreting
IV estimates in the presence of heterogenous treatment effects as a local average treatment effect (LATE).
We show through a series of simple examples that in some commonly featured cases that this assumption
is likely to be violated among inframarginal agents, i.e. the always- and never-takers. This violation
of the exclusion restriction will generally confound the LATE interpretation of the associated IV results.
We discuss potential adjustments to IV estimates in the presence of this bias.

Abstract
We explore a key underlying assumption, the exclusion restriction,
commonly used in interpreting IV estimates in the presence of heterogenous treatment effects as a local average treatment effect (LATE). We
show through a series of simple examples that in some commonly featured
cases that this assumption is likely to be violated among inframarginal
agents, i.e. the always- and never-takers. This violation of the exclusion
restriction will generally confound the LATE interpretation of the associated IV results. We discuss potential adjustments to IV estimates in the
presence of this bias.
JEL Classification: C26, I26, J01

The method of instrumental variables (IV) is a wildly popular approach for
estimating causal effects (see Angrist and Pischke, 2008, for a review). A common interpretation of these IV estimates is that they recover a local average
treatment effect (LATE) among a subpopulation of compliers—i.e. those whose
treatment status is altered by the instrumental variable (Imbens and Angrist,
1994). We will explore one of the key assumptions, the exclusion restriction,
which underlies this interpretation of IV estimates. In particular, we show
that restating the standard potential outcome framework as a simple economic
model of utility maximization highlights settings where (1) the exclusion restriction is commonly assumed but where (2) the exclusion restriction is likely
to be violated. In these cases, the interpretation of standard IV estimates as
identifying a local average treatment effect (LATE) among compliers may no
longer hold. In particular, estimation of the LATE may be biased by changes
in outcomes among inframarginal agents, i.e. the so-called ”always-takers” and
”never-takers.”

To demonstrate the intuition behind this result, consider the estimation of
the effect of higher education on subsequent earnings. Suppose we have an
instrument—a randomly assigned subsidy for college tuition. We may use this
instrument in an IV framework to recover the LATE among those students who
will only attend college if they have received this educational subsidy, i.e. the
compliers. In the standard LATE framework, there are two other groups: the
always-takers, who will attend college with or without the subsidy, and the
never-takers, who will not attend college, even with the subsidy. The exclusion restriction assumption implies that since the tuition subsidy does not alter
college-going among the two latter groups, it has no it has no effect on their
subsequent earnings. It follows that differences in subsequent earnings between
those who have received the subsidy and those who have not are driven solely
by the group of compliers.
Now reconsider the case of the always-taker. In the absence of the subsidy,
she will attend college and will have to pay full tuition. If she is randomly given
a tuition subsidy, she will still attend college, but will not have to pay as much to
cover the costs. Although her college attendance may not be altered, i.e. there is
no direct substitution effect on educational attainment, she may yet experience
an income effect, as the college subsidy relaxes the overall budget constraint
of inframarginal college-goers. In general, this income effect may cause her to
change her subsequent labor supply and, thus, earnings. IV estimates which
rely on variation in subsequent earnings between recipients and non-recipients
of the tuition subsidy will now pick up differences among the always-takers.
In general, we show below that instruments, such as price subsidies or legal
penalties, have the potential to alter outcomes among agents who are inframarginal with respect to treatment status. In what follows, we flesh out this
potential bias more formally, in the context of the preceding and other examples, and more generally. We additionally discuss methods of adjusting for this
potential bias using either external studies or augmented experimental designs.
This is not the first paper to explore potential violations of the exclusion
restriction assumption. For example, Heckman (1997) identifies potential violations to the exclusion restriction that stem from selection into treatment
status based on individual, unobserved components of heterogeneous treatment
effects. The type of violations discussed here concern affects of an instrument
on inframarginal agents, i.e. members of the ”aways-takers” and ”never-takers”
subpopulations. This is discussed in Angrist, Imbens and Rubin (1996), who
mention that with respect to the exclusion restriction, ”the researcher must
consider, at the unit level, the effect of changing the value of the instrument
while holding the value of the treatment fixed” (pg. 449). In this paper, we
look more formally into cases where such an effect may exist and, thus, alter
our interpretation of IV estimates.
Another relevant study is that of Rosenzweig and Wolpin (2000), who discuss
the use of the gender composition of earlier born children as an instrument for
subsequent fertility in studies of fertility and labor supply (Angrist and Evans,
1998, see e.g.). Rosenzweig and Wolpin (2000) argue that economies of scale
in having earlier children of the same sex—via, for example, hand me down
2

clothes—generate income effects that may directly affect subsequent labor supply. This is similar to one of our examples below, in Section 3.1, where income
effects among always-takers are likewise a potential threat to the exclusion restriction. In our case, we explicitly outline how such phenomenon may bias
estimation of the LATE, highlight the role played by inframarginal agents and
suggest and method for adjusting for this bias.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 briefly reviews the
LATE framework as presented in Imbens and Angrist (1994) and Section 2
recasts the setup in the context of a model of utility maximization, following
Pinto (2015). In Section 3 we identify in general the types of violations of
the exclusion restriction that may occur and provided specific examples of these
violations. We then discuss methods of adjusting for the potential bias in Section
4 and conclude in Section 5.

1

Heterogenous Treatment Effect Framework

We begin by briefly summarizing the standard, potential outcomes framework
for heterogenous treatment effects. We are interested in the causal effect of
some treatment status, D, on an outcome, y . We also observe an instrument,
Z, which affects, ether directly or indirectly, treatment status and the outcome.
Each individual i has a potential outcome yi (Di , Zi ), which depends on the value
of the instrument and treatment. Individual i also has a potential treatment
status, Di (Zi ), which depends on the value of the instrument. We restrict
attention to the case where both the instrument and the treatment variables
are binary — i.e. Di ∈ {0, 1} and Zi ∈ {0, 1}. Following Imbens and Angrist
(1994), four assumptions are typically made regarding the variables of interest:
Assumption 1 (LATE Assumptions)
|=

1.1. Independence: {yi (Di (1) , 1) , yi (Di (0) , 0) , Di (1) , Di (0)}

Zi ;

1.2. Exclusion: yi (d, 1) = yi (d, 0) ≡ yi (d) for d = 0, 1;
1.3. First stage: E [Di (1) − Di (0)] 6= 0;
1.4. Monotonicity: Di (1) − Di (0) ≥ 0∀i.
Given the assumptions above, define the treatment effect of Di on yi for
individual i as yi (1) − yi (0). Imbens and Angrist (1994) show that the four
assumptions imply that a local average treatment effect (LATE) is identified for
a subgroup:
E [yi |Zi = 1] − E [yi |Zi = 0]
= E [yi (1) − yi (0) |Di (1) > Di (0)]
E [Di |Zi = 1] − E [Di |Zi = 0]

(1)

That is, the IV estimate of the effect of Di on yi , using the instrument Zi
identifies the causal effect of Di on yi for the subgroup of individuals, the compliers, for whom the instrument alters treatment status — i.e. those for whom
Di (1) > Di (0).

2

An Economic Model of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

We now restate the standard heterogeneous treatment effects framework as
model of utility maximization, using a version of the framework presented by
Pinto (2015). The model in its most general form nests the potential outcome
framework above and will prove useful in exploring the plausibility of Assumption 1.2 above, the exclusion restriction. The model proceeds in two stages.1
Let the outcome of interest, yi (Di , Zi ) ≡ f (xi (Di , Zi )) be a function of inputs,
xi (Di , Zi ). In turn, the inputs are defined as the solution to a second-stage
utility maximization problem:
xi (Di , Zi ) =

argmax

u (x; Di , Zi , εi )

x∈B(Di ,Zi ,εi )

where Di , and Zi are defined as before, εi is a vector of potentially unobservable
covariates for individual i, and B (Di , Zi , εi ) is the choice set (or budget set)
from which x is chosen. The choice set is potentially constrained by treatment
status, Di , the value of the instrument, Zi , and elements of the vector εi . Note
that this maximization takes the treatment status, Di , as given. We separately
define Di (Zi ) as the result of a first stage maximization exercise:
Di (Zi ) = argmax vi (D, Zi )
D∈G(Zi ,εi )

where G (Zi , εi ) is the choice set from which Di is chosen, potentially constrained
by the instrument, Zi , and unobservables, εi , and vi (Di , Zi ) is the value function
of the second-stage maximization problem:
vi (Di , Zi ) ≡

max
x∈B(Di ,Zi ,εi )

u (x; Di , Zi , εi )

Note, the model can accommodate alternative approaches commonly found in
the treatment effects literature. For example, the model can capture a Roy
framework where treatment status is endogenous and related to the potential
outcomes. Alternatively, the model also captures settings where choice is trivial and the relationship between instrument and treatment status is purely
mechanical or probabilistic — e.g. the choice set, G, may be a singleton
G (Zi , εi ) = {1 {εi + α · Zi > 0}}.

Violations of the Exclusion Restriction

We now turn to the question of when the general model in Section 2 collapses
to the standard case in Section 1. In particular, we maintain Assumptions 1.1,
1 Note,

the two-part nature of the optimization problem is solely for illustrative purposes.
The solution to the problem is equivalent when treatment status and the inputs are jointly
determined.

4

1.3 and 1.4 and examine when Assumption 1.2, the exclusion restriction, may
be violated. First, note that sufficient conditions for the exclusion restriction
are:
B (Di , 1, εi )

=

B (Di , 0, εi ) = B (Di , εi )

u (xi ; Di , 1, εi )

=

u (xi ; Di , 0, εi ) = u (xi ; Di , εi ) .

We therefore focus on cases where one of these sufficient conditions do not hold,
and examine whether the exclusion restriction continues to hold. To illustrate
the key intuition behind this observation, we proceed with two simple and stylized cases of the general model in Section 2. The examples are not intended to
provide an exhaustive set of cases where the exclusion restriction may be violated, but rather, to convince the reader that in very common settings where the
exclusion restriction is invoked, we may have reason to question the assumption
on the basis of first principles. In each case, the agent will solve some modified
version of the following, simple labor supply problem:
max u (c, l)
c,l

s.t. c = wl + I
where c is consumption, l is labor, w are wages and I is non-labor income.
Let xi = (c∗i (wi , Ii ) , li∗ (wi , Ii )) be the optimal level of consumption and labor
supply chosen in this setting, generally functions of wages and other income.
The outcome of interest will be earnings — i.e. yi = wi li∗ (wi , Ii ) . The treatment of interest will be some discrete measure of education, Di , and the casual
relationship of interest will be the return to education on earnings. We will
consider two cases based on the instrument used: subsidies for higher education
and compulsory school laws.

3.1

Example 1: Subsidies for Higher Education

Let Zi represent a subsidy that covers a share, 1 − θ, of tuition for students
and is randomly offered to a subset of students, i.e. those for whom Zi = 1.
Treatment status in this case, Di , is a dummy variable that indicates whether or
not a student attends college. Let college tuition be p. Individuals who attend
college experience an increase in wages by a factor of φi . Individuals are also
endowed with a source of non-labor income, Ii . Conditional on the instrument,
Zi , and the decision of whether or not to attend college, Di , individuals solve
the following utility maximization problem:
max u (c, l)

Given Assumption 1.4, there are three sets of individuals: compliers, alwaystakers and never-takers. Consider, always-takers, i.e. those for whom Di (1) =
Di (0) = 1. These individuals will attend college with or without the subsidy.
We can show that the exclusion restriction will generally be violated for these
individuals:
yi (Di (1) , 1)

=

wi φi l∗ (wi φi , Ii − θp)

≤

wi φi li∗ (wi φi , Ii − p)

= yi (Di (0) , 0) ,
where the second line follows from the assumption that leisure is a normal good.
Intuitively, the always-taker is an inframarginal college-going student, for whom
a college subsidy generates an income effect of (1 − θ) p. Except for the case
where there are no income effects on labor supply, we may expect the exclusion
restriction to be violated for the always-taker. Note as well that this example
extends to cases where there is not only a partial offset of costs, but in-kind
transfer of a good such as college education, e.g. the case where θ = 0 and we
evaluate x0 ≡ 1 when x = 0.

3.2

Example 2: Compulsory School Laws

Now let Zi be an indicator for whether or not and individual’s day of birth
requires her by law to complete a given year of school, e.g. she must remain in
school until her 18th birthday, the last day of school during her senior year is
at time t, and her 18th birthday does not occur until some date beyond time
t. Let Di be a dummy variable indicating whether or not a student finishes
her senior year. Suppose that if an individual disobeys the law, there is some
disutility, proporitional to µi , that is experienced. This may represent some fine
or penalty, guilt or stigma associated with being caught out of school before age
18. Additionally, let individuals allocate their labor supply, li , between working and receiving a market wage or putting forth evasion effort, ei , to mitigate
the disutility associated with disobeying compulsory school laws. Finally, let
the additional year of schooling during the senior year increase market wages
6

by a factor of φi . Conditional on the bite of the school law, Zi , and the decision to attend school during the senior year, Di , individuals solve the following
maximization problem:
max u (c, l) − Zi (1 − Di )
c,l,e

µi
e

i
s.t. c = wi φD
i (l − e) + Ii

The additional term in the objective function captures the fact that the disutility
of being caught disobeying compulsory school laws is only relevant for those who
are both subject to the laws, Zi = 1, and who are not obeying the law, Di = 0.
Utility maximization once again yields optimal consumption, labor supply and
evasion, c∗i , li∗ and e∗i , respectively.
In terms of the notation in Section 2, we have:
εi
B (Di , Z, εi )
G (Zi , εi )

=

(φ , wi , Ii , µi )

o
i
=

−
e)
+
I
i
i
= {0, 1}

xi

=

(ci , li , ei )

yi

i
= wi φD
i (li − ei ) .

Now consider the never-takers, for whom Di (1) = Di (0) = 0. These individuals will choose to drop out of school whether or not the compulsory school
laws apply. We can show that the exclusion restriction will now generally be
violated for these individuals:
yi (Di (1) , 1)

=

wi · [li∗ (wi , Ii − wi e∗i ) − e∗i ]

≤ wi li∗ (wi , Ii )
= yi (Di (0) , 0) ,
where in the first line, we use the fact that the disutility of disobeying the law
enters into utility in an additively separable fashion, which allows us to represent
labor supply as a function of the wage and residual income. In the second
line, we can show that earnings are lower whenever e∗i > 0 if we assume that
consumption is a normal good. In this case, we can view the never takers as an
inframarginal group, with respect to dropping out of high school. Since she will
do so either way, when she is additionally subject to the compulsory school law,
the never taker bears the additional burden of disobeying the law.2 In this case,
we have a fine or penalty that is used as an instrument for treatment status. In
such instances, those never takers who incur the penalty may potentially violate
the exclusion restriction.
2 Note, we have chosen a specific way in which effort to avoid geing caught disobeying
affects the time available to earn income. However, we could have more generally modeled
this effort as a nonseparable argument of utility that potentially affects the marginal rate of
substitution between labor supply and consumption.

Adjusting for the Potential Bias

4.1

Adjustment via Calibration

The general bias involved with these violations of the exclusion restriction may
vary considerably. However, in some cases, we may be able to at least sign
the bias and/or potentially quantify it. We can then adjust traditional IV
estimates for this bias. We demonstrate this in the case of subsidies for higher
education. In this setting, we assume that outcomes for the never-takers, i.e.
those for whom Di (1) = Di (0) = 0 are not affected by the instrument Zi . In
other words, the effect of the subsidy on the choice set of those who do not go
to college is irrelevant. We show in Appendix A that, in this case, the Wald
estimator of the LATE can be expressed as follows:
π AT
E [yi |Zi = 1] − E [yi |Zi = 0]
= β LAT E +
η ,
E [Di |Zi = 1] − E [Di |Zi = 0]
π C AT

(2)

where:
β LAT E

=

E [yi (1, 1) − yi (0, 0) |Di (1) > Di (0)]

π AT

=

Pr (Di (1) = Di (0) = 1)

πC

=

Pr (Di (1) > Di (0))

η AT

=

E [yi (1, 1) − yi (1, 0) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 1]

The parameter of interest, β LAT E , is the local average treatment effect among
compliers. The Wald estimator is biased by a term that is a function of π AT ,
the share of always-takers, π C , the share of compliers and η AT , the effect of
the instrument on the outcomes among always-takers. We may not be able to
directly estimate η AT ; however, we can, in some cases, perform a back-of-theenvelope calculation of this parameter. Returning to the example in Section 3.1,
the difference in earnings among always-takers is driven by an income effect, i.e.
η AT = ∂y/∂I× (1 − θ) p. If leisure is a normal good, we might expect the sign
of the bias in (2) to be negative. However, if relief from the cost of tuition allows
for great human capital investment or more effective job search, the effect may
very well be positive.
Suppose that we use ln (y) as our outcome variable, so that the parameter
β LAT E may be interpreted as the percent increase in earnings as a result of
attending college. We can draw on existing estimates from Rothstein and Rouse
(2011), who study the impact of a phase-out of loans at a college university.
They find that replacing loans with grants for students who qualify for financial
aid reduces earnings by $2,657 annually, from a base of $51,025 —i.e. η AT ≈
−0.05. Suppose we assume that tuition subsidies of this type increase college
attendance by about 50 percent (see e.g. Dynarski, 2003). This implies that
π AT /π C = 2. Finally, assume that we have estimated an IV estimate of β IV =
0.22 (see e.g. Zimmerman, 2014). Then, using Equation 2 above, the Wald
estimator will be biased downward by 0.1. After adjusting for the bias, we have

8

a LATE estimate of β LAT E = β IV − ππAT
η AT = 0.32. The estimate is now 45
C
percent higher.
Thus, adjusting for the bias from the violation of the exclusion restriction
may very well have a significant effect on one’s estimates. All things equal, this
bias is increasing in the share of always-takers, π AT , i.e. the baseline level of
college attendance. The bias is decreasing in the share of compliers, π C — or
put another way, decreasing in the size of the first-stage impact of the subsidy
on college-going. The impact of the instrument is larger when tuition subsidies
are significant relative to income, e.g. in developing countries. However, the
type of subsidy that produces a relatively large π C will also tend to generate a
larger η AT in magnitude, which works in the opposite direction and exacerbates
the bias.

4.2

Adjustment via Experimental Design

In the case where the instrument Zi is varied experimentally, the use of a second
instrument may aid in estimating any potential bias associated with a violation
of the exclusion restriction. We again demonstrate this in the case of the subsidies for higher education. Suppose that the tuition subsidy Zi randomly assigned to a set of treatment students. Furthermore, suppose that the researcher
is able to introduce a new, orthogonal cash instrument, Ti , which is a binary
variable that indicates whether a student is given a cash transfer of (1 − θ) p
dollars. By virtue of random assignment, we assume that Ti satisfies the independence assumption, i.e. Assumption 1.1. In addition, we will need to assume
that treatment participation, Di , is not affected directly by this instrument, Ti ,
in a manner similar to the original exclusion restriction, i.e. Assumption 1.2. We
now define the treatment, Di (Zi , Ti ), and potential outcomes, yi (Di , Zi , Ti ), as
functions of both instruments, Zi and Ti . Formally, we assume the following:3
Assumption 2 (Cash Instrument Assumptions)

|=

2.1. Independence: {yi (Di (1, 1) , 1, 1) , yi (Di (0, 0) , 0, 0) , yi (Di (1, 0) , 1, 0) ,
yi (Di (0, 1) , 0, 1) , Di (1, 1) , Di (0, 0) , Di (1, 0) , Di (0, 1)} (Zi , Ti );
2.2. Exclusion: Di (z, 1) = Di (z, 0) ≡ Di (z) for z = 0, 1.
The variation in this additional treatment, Ti , can be used to identify the
kind of income effects that may be causing a violation of the exclusion restriction. To see this, note that in the context of the model in Section 3.1, the budget
set is now:
n
o
i
B (Di , Zi , Ti , εi ) = (c, l) |c + θZi pDi = wi φD
i l + Ii + (1 − θ) pTi
3 Note, Assumption 2.2 has a testable implication — namely, E [D |T = 1] = E [D |T = 0].
i i
i i
We can also make a slightly weaker assumption, i.e. Di (0, 1) = Di (0, 0) = Di (0), which
carries an analogous implication — i.e. E [Di |Zi = 0, Ti = 1] = E [Di |Zi = 0, Ti = 0].

9

It follows that among always-takers, i.e. those for whom Di (1) = Di (0) = 1,
we have the following:
yi (Di (0) , 0, 1)

= wi φi l∗ (wi φi , Ii − p + (1 − θ) pTi )
= wi φi l∗ (wi φi , Ii − θp)
= yi (Di (1) , 1, 0)

(3)

Thus, we may estimate the effect of the instrument among always-takers, η AT ,
using the following:
E [yi |Zi = 0, Ti = 1, Di = 1] − E [yi |Zi = 0, Ti = 0, Di = 1]
= E [yi (Di (0) , 0, 1) |Zi = 0, Ti = 1, Di = 1] − E [yi (Di (0) , 0, 0) |Zi = 0, Ti = 0, Di = 1]
= E [yi (Di (0) , 0, 1) |Di (0) = 1] − E [yi (Di (0) , 0, 0) |Di (0) = 1]
= E [yi (Di (0) , 0, 1) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 1] − E [yi (Di (0) , 0, 0) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 1]
= E [yi (Di (1) , 1, 0) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 1] − E [yi (Di (0) , 0, 0) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 1]
= η AT ,
where in the third line we make use of independence and the monotonicity
assumption, i.e. Assumptions 1.1 and 1.4, and in the fourth line, we make
use of equation (3). In this way, augmenting an experimental design with an
additional instrument that aids in identifying the income effects may allow one
to adjust for the bias.

Conclusion

We have shown in two very specific examples that the exclusion restriction commonly assumed in applied settings may be plausibly violated. In particular, we
have shown a case where the instrument used involves a subsidy that encourages adoption of a treatment, e.g. pursuing college education. In this setting,
inframarginal members of the treatment group, i.e. always-takers, will tend to
violate the exclusion restriction. Subsidies for this group relax the budget constraint through income effects associated with the instrument. In another case
where a penalty discourages not adopting a treatment, e.g. dropping out of
high school, we demonstrated that inframarginal members of the control group,
i.e. never-takers, are likely to violate the exclusion restriction. Penalties incurred among this group effectively tighten the budget constraint and/or alter
outcomes via direct effects on utility and marginal rates of substitution.
It should be noted that although behavioral and psychological effects of instruments can always be constructed by allowing the value of the instrument to
directly enter into the utility function, the result here relies on much more traditional economic incentives — income effects associated with subsidies or costly
risks and evasive measures associated with breaking the law. Furthermore, the
specific nature of these examples is intended to facilitate straightforward illustration of the key argument. The underlying intuition is readily extended to a

10

much broader class of settings, many of which are commonly considered in the
applied literature.
The powerful results that allow us to apply a well-defined casual interpretation to IV estimates as LATEs in part hinge on the implications of the exclusion
restriction. Variation in the instrument only alters treatment status for the set
of compliers. Since the exclusion restriction implies that the outcome of interest can only be affected by the instrument via its impact on treatment status,
the variation in outcomes associated with the instrument can therefore be associated with compliers. Put another way, the numerator in equation (1) is
only driven by differences in outcomes among compliers. However, as is demonstrated above, one must take care to note that the appropriateness of this result
depends on whether the instrument in question is likely to alter outcome for
inframarginal treatment group and control group members as well, even though
treatment status is constant for these individuals (Angrist, Imbens and Rubin,
1996). In some cases, additional information regarding income effects, either
taken from external studies or built into an experimental design, may help to
adjust IV estimates for this potential bias.

Appendix A: Derivation of Bias Formula
We maintain Assumptions 1.1, 1.3 and 1.4 and evaluate the following Wald
estimator:
E [yi |Zi = 1] − E [yi |Zi = 0]
E [Di |Zi = 1] − E [Di |Zi = 0]
We can express the first term in the numerator as follows:
E [yi |Zi = 1]

=

Pr ( Di (1) = Di (0) = 1| Zi = 1) · E [yi (1, 1) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 1, Zi = 1]
+ Pr ( Di (1) > Di (0)| Zi = 1) · E [yi (1, 1) |Di (1) > Di (0) , Zi = 1]
+ Pr ( Di (1) < Di (0)| Zi = 1) · E [yi (0, 1) |Di (1) < Di (0) , Zi = 1]
+ Pr ( Di (1) = Di (0) = 0| Zi = 1) · E [yi (0, 1) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 0, Zi = 1]

=

Pr (Di (1) = Di (0) = 1) · E [yi (1, 1) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 1]
+ Pr (Di (1) > Di (0)) · E [yi (1, 1) |Di (1) > Di (0)]
+ Pr (Di (1) < Di (0)) · E [yi (0, 1) |Di (1) < Di (0)]
+ Pr (Di (1) = Di (0) = 0) · E [yi (0, 1) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 0]

= π AT · E [yi (1, 1) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 1]
+π C · E [yi (1, 1) |Di (1) > Di (0)]
+π N T · E [yi (0, 1) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 0] ,
where in the second step, we made use of Assumption 1.1, in the third step we
used the fact that Assumption 1.4 implies Pr (Di (1) < Di (0)) = 0, and the π
parameters are defined as follows:
π AT

=

Pr (Di (1) = Di (0) = 1)

πC

=

Pr (Di (1) > Di (0))

πN T

=

Pr (Di (1) = Di (0) = 0) .

Using very similar steps, we can show that:
E [yi |Zi = 0]

= π AT · E [yi (1, 0) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 1]
+π C · E [yi (0, 0) |Di (1) > Di (0)]
+π N T · E [yi (0, 0) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 0]

Again, we assume in the case of a school subsidy that the instrument, Zi , will
not have an effect on the outcomes of never takers, i.e.:
E [yi (0, 0) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 0] = E [yi (0, 1) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 0]
12

Put together, we have the following expression for the numerator of the Wald
estimator:
E [yi |Zi = 1] − E [yi |Zi = 0]

= π AT · E [yi (1, 1) − yi (1, 0) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 1]
+π C · E [yi (1, 1) − yi (0, 0) |Di (1) > Di (0)]
(A.1)

Turning to the first term in the denominator, we can show the following:
E [Di |Zi = 1]

=

Pr ( Di (1) = Di (0) = 1| Zi = 1) · Pr ( Di (1) = 1| Di (1) = Di (0) = 1, Zi = 1)
+ Pr ( Di (1) > Di (0)| Zi = 1) · Pr ( Di (1) = 1| Di (1) > Di (0) , Zi = 1)
+ Pr ( Di (1) < Di (0)| Zi = 1) · Pr ( Di (1) = 1| Di (1) < Di (0) , Zi = 1)
+ Pr ( Di (1) = Di (0) = 0| Zi = 1) · Pr ( Di (1) = 1| Di (1) = Di (0) = 0, Zi = 1)

=

Pr (Di (1) = Di (0) = 1) + Pr (Di (1) > Di (0))

=

π AT + π C ,

where in the second step, we once again made use of Assumption 1.1 and also
used the fact that
Pr ( Di (1) = 1| Di (1) = Di (0) = 1, Zi = 1)

=

1,

Pr ( Di (1) = 1| Di (1) > Di (0) , Zi = 1)

=

1,

Pr ( Di (1) = 1| Di (1) = Di (0) = 0, Zi = 1)

=

0

and, by Assumption 1.4,
Pr ( Di (1) < Di (0)| Zi = 1) = 0.
Likewise, we can show that:
E [Di |Zi = 0] = π AT
Thus, the denominator of the Wald is:
E [Di |Zi = 1] − E [Di |Zi = 0] = π C

(A.2)

Combining Equations A.1 and A.2, we have:
E [yi |Zi = 1] − E [yi |Zi = 0]
E [Di |Zi = 1] − E [Di |Zi = 0]

=

=

πC
E [yi (1, 1) − yi (0, 0) |Di (1) > Di (0)]
πC
π AT
+
E [yi (1, 1) − yi (1, 0) |Di (1) = Di (0) = 1]
