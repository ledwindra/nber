    "abstract": "\n\nThe extent of use of twenty innovations in the operation of public libraries is examined in 31 large public library systems across the country. The innovations include the use of computers in ordering, cataloging, and circulating materials. The pattern of diffusion of the innovations across the systems is explored using contingency tables and discriminant analysis. All the large library systems seem to participate in early adoption of some innovations; none seem to be pace-setters for all innovations. The extent of diffusion of some innovations may be reduced by the development of successive innovations that replace them. Only some of the innovations seem to be climax technologies that are likely to persist for longer periods of time.\n\n",
