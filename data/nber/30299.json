    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine the short- and long-term effects of expanded Medicaid pregnancy coverage to undocumented immigrants using a novel dataset that links California birth records to Census surveys and administrative records on mortality, earnings, educational attainment, and public program participation. We identify siblings born to immigrant mothers before and after the policy and implement a mothers\u2019 fixed effects design to estimate policy impacts. We find the policy increased insurance and prenatal care among pregnant immigrant women, and improved birth outcomes. Later in life, their children experience better educational outcomes, have fewer children at young ages, and receive less public support.\n\n",
