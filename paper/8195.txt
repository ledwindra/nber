The Comovements between Real Activity and Prices in the G7
Wouter J. Den Haan Steven Sumner*

1. Introduction
Descriptions of the cyclical behavior of the price level play an important role in
macroeconomics. Clearly, there are many ways to describe the properties of economic
variables. Typically, a concise set of moments is used to estimate and/or test a model
after a filter has been used to render the data stationary. The focus on only a limited set of
statistics is often motivated either by the idea that the model is not intended to be an
accurate description of the data in all dimensions, or by the fact that more efficient
econometric techniques, like maximum likelihood, cannot be used because of technical
difficulties.1 A crucial question, therefore, is what moments to use. Compounding the
difficulty in answering this question is the fact that the moments of interest (standard
deviation and correlation coefficients) typically require the data to be stationary.
This paper examines the correlation between prices and output for the G7
countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United
States) during the postwar period. We use both the correlation of VAR forecast errors as
proposed in Den Haan (2000) and the correlations of prices and output after a frequency
domain filter has been used to isolate the frequencies of interest as proposed by Baxter
and King (1994). Den Haan (2000) shows that the VAR procedure can be used for
stationary as well as integrated stochastic variables. In this paper we similarly show that

Geweke (1999), for example, shows that the likelihood function of a dynamic economic model is
typically zero, either because obtaining numerical solutions of the model requires discrete support of the
stochastic driving process which happens in the data only with probability zero or requires the number of
unobservable state variables to be small which leads to relationships between variables that are rejected
with probability one in the data. The last problem can be avoided by following the standard practice in
regression analysis to add a stochastic error term to each policy function, which would, of course, be
ludicrous in a dynamic stochastic model.

the frequency domain filters can be used for stationary and I(1) and I(2) stochastic
variables. By considering different forecast horizons and frequency domain filters that
isolate different frequency bands, we capture important dynamic information about the
comovement of prices and output. By considering these two alternative sets of dynamic
statistics we offer a more complete description of the comovement between prices and
output than other empirical studies in the literature, and are capable of drawing stronger
conclusions about the kind of theoretical models that are consistent and inconsistent with
the observed comovements.2 In particular, we find that, virtually always, the “long-run”
correlations between prices and output are significantly negative and that the “short-run”
correlations are substantially higher. Although there is evidence of positive “short-run”
correlations for some countries, it is not very robust to the choice of the price and output
variables.
Backus and Kehoe (1992), Cooley and Ohanian (1991), and Fiorito and Kolintzas
(1994) show that the correlation between HP-filtered prices and output is negative for
several countries during the postwar period.3 Initially these negative correlation
coefficients were believed to support models in which supply shocks play a dominant
role. Chadha and Prasad (1993), Judd and Trehan (1995), and Ball and Mankiw (1994),
however, showed that these negative correlation coefficients do not provide much
identifying information because sticky-price models with only demand shocks can easily
generate a negative correlation between prices and output when the HP-filter is used to
filter the data. Den Haan (2000) shows, however, that the negative correlation between
VAR forecast errors that we find in this paper cannot be generated by these type of
models under sensible assumptions. This paper, therefore, provide support for the claim
made by Kydland and Prescott (1990) that “any theory in which procyclical prices figure
crucially in accounting for postwar business cycle fluctuations is doomed to failure”.
In this paper, we also offer some methodological contributions. First, we propose
a new procedure to implement the method proposed in Den Haan (2000). We show that

Backus and Kehoe (1992) analyze the empirical comovement between annual prices and output for ten
OECD countries for both the postwar and several prewar periods, Cooley and Ohanian (1991) provides a
description of the comovement of US output and prices for both the postwar and several prewar periods,
and Fiorito and Kollintzas (1994) investigates the behavior of output and prices for the G7 during the
postwar period.

Similarly, Pakko (2000) shows using a postwar sample that the cospectrum of US GDP and its deflator is
negative at those frequencies corresponding roughly to the HP filter.

imposing the restrictions implied by the estimated VAR in calculating the correlation
coefficients of VAR forecast errors results in substantial efficiency gains. Second, in
contrast to claims made in the literature4, this paper shows that band-pass and high-pass
frequency domain filters succeed in eliminating that part of the series associated with
frequencies outside of the specified band for stationary as well as integrated processes.
The paper is organized as follows. The following section describes the
methodology to calculate the correlation coefficients of the VAR forecast errors
discussed in Den Haan (2000) and the new procedure used to implement the method.
Section 3 discusses how frequency domain filters can be used to provide a concise set of
statistics to describe the comovement of stationary as well as I(1) and I(2) variables.
Section 4 discusses the empirical findings and the last section concludes.

2. Measuring correlations at different forecast horizons
In Section 2.1, we review the procedure proposed in Den Haan (2000) to measure
the comovement between economic variables. In Section 2.2, we discuss the relationship
between this procedure and the impulse response functions from structural VARs.

2.1 Using forecast errors to calculate correlation coefficients
Consider an N-vector of random variables, Xt. The vector Xt is allowed to contain
any combination of stationary processes and processes that are integrated of arbitrary
order. If one wants to describe the comovement between prices, Pt, and output, Yt, then
Xt has to include at least Pt and Yt. Consider the following VAR:
L

(2.1)

X t =a +bt + ct 2 + ∑ Al X t − l +vt
l =1

where Al is an N×N matrix of regression coefficients; a, b and c are N-vectors of
constants; vt is an N-vector of innovations; and the total number of lags included is equal
to L. The elements of vt are assumed to be serially uncorrelated but they can be
correlated with one another. We denote the K-period ahead forecast and the K-period
ahead forecast error of the variable Yt by Et Yt+K and Ytue
+ K ,t , respectively. We do the same

ue
for Pt. We denote the covariance between the random variables Ptue
+ K ,t and Yt + K , t by

COV(K) and the correlation coefficient between these two variables by COR(K).
If the series are stationary, then the correlation coefficient of the forecast errors
will converge to the unconditional correlation coefficient of the two series as K goes to
infinity. Den Haan (2000) shows that if some of the time series are not stationary then
COV(K) and COR(K) can still be estimated consistently for a fixed K. It is important to
note that no assumption on the order of integration of the elements of Xt has to be made.
For example, it is possible that Xt contains stationary as well as integrated processes.
However, an important assumption for the derivation of the consistency results is that
Equation (2.1) is correctly specified. In particular, the lag order must be large enough to
guarantee that νt is serially uncorrelated and not integrated. That is, if Xt contains I(1)
stochastic processes, then the lag order has to be at least equal to 1. Likewise, if Xt
contains I(2) stochastic processes, then the lag order has to be at least equal to 2. When
Xt includes integrated processes one might prefer to estimate a VAR in first differences or
an error-correction system. When the restrictions that lead to these systems are correct,
then imposing the restrictions may lead to more efficient forecasts in a finite sample. If
they are not correct then the system is misspecified and the estimator might be biased.5
There are two ways to construct estimates of the covariance terms. Den
Haan (2000) constructs time series for the forecast errors using the difference between
the realizations and their forecasts and calculates the covariance of the created time
series. A disadvantage of using the actual forecast errors is that one looses several
observations, which shortens the sample size especially for longer forecast horizons. The
second way to construct estimates is to use the covariance that is implied by the VAR
coefficients and the variance-covariance matrix of νt. In the appendix we show that there
are substantial efficiency gains by using the second method.
The correlation coefficients are calculated as follows using the second method.
The VAR given in Equation (2.1) for a sample of T observations can be written as
L

X T =∑ X T −l Al’ + vT ,
l =1

where for simplicity we have set the constant and the trend terms equal to zero. This
system can be written as the following first-order VAR system

Z T = Z T −1 F ′+ uT ,

(2.3)

where ZT is a (T×LN) matrix equal to [ XT XT-1 ⋅⋅⋅ XT-L+1], uT is a (T×LN) matrix equal to
[ νT 0T,N ⋅⋅⋅ 0T,N], and

where F0 = INL and Ω = E (uT′uT)/T.
2.2 The relationship with impulse response functions
There is an alternative way to use the VAR to construct measures of
comovements at different forecast horizons that clarifies the relationship between our
procedure and impulse response functions. We can write the K-period ahead forecast
error, Ytue
+ K ,t , as follows:
(2.5)

Ytue
+ K , t = Yt + K − E t + K − 1Yt + K + E t + K − 1Yt + K − E t + K − 2Yt + K + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + E t + 1Yt + K − E t Yt + K

)

In this equation, the K-period ahead forecast error is written as the sum of the updates in
the forecast of Yt+K, starting at period t+1. The first term on the right hand side is just the
one-period ahead forecast error realized at period t+K. The second term is the update of
the two-period ahead forecast and the other terms are defined similarly. We denote the

(

)

covariance between E t + K − k +1Yt + K − E t + K − k Yt + K and E t + K − k +1 Pt + K − E t + K − k Pt + K by
COV∆(k). Since the terms on the right hand side of Equation (2.5) are serially
uncorrelated, there is a simple relationship between COV(K), defined in Section 2.1, and
COV∆(k). That is,

5

∑ COV

(k ) .

k =1

When K= k =1, then the two covariances are identical. The “COV∆(k)” covariances,
therefore, contain the same information as the “COV(K)” covariances. Calculating
standard errors for the COV∆(k) statistics may seem easier since the updates of the Kperiod ahead forecasts are serially uncorrelated and the K-period ahead forecast errors are
not. However, in both cases calculating standard errors is a complicated exercise because
the forecasts are obtained from an estimated VAR and the standard errors of the
covariance statistics should incorporate the sampling uncertainty due to the estimation of
the VAR. Den Haan (2000) shows that the sign of the COV(K) terms has more
identifying information than the sign of the COV∆(k) terms.6 Therefore, we will focus on
the COV(K) terms not the COV∆(k) terms.
The “COV∆(k)” covariances are helpful in clarifying the relationship between the
proposed statistics and impulse response functions. Suppose that vt = Bεt, where B is an
N×M matrix of coefficients and εt is an M-vector of (independent) fundamental shocks.
Without loss of generality assume that each element of εt has unit variance. Let Ykimp ,m be
the effect on output in response to a one standard deviation shock in the mth element of εt
after k periods. Thus, Ykimp ,m is the impulse response of Yt after k periods. We define
Pkimp,m in the same manner. Then, COV∆(k) is equal to the sum of the products of the kstep impulse responses across all fundamental shocks. That is,
M

(2.7)

COV ∆ (k )=∑Ykimp, m Pkimp , m .
m =1

When there is only one fundamental shock, i.e. M = 1, then COV∆(k) is equal to the
product of the impulse response functions. For the special situation, where Ykimp
and Pkimp always have the opposite sign, the COV∆(k) will be negative for every value of k.
To understand Equation (2.7) for the case when M > 1, note that shocks that have a

In particular, COV∆(k) could be negative for some k in models with only demand shocks as long as the
effect of a demand shock on output and prices has the opposite sign at some point while COV(K) can only
be negative when the accumulated effect of a demand shock on output and prices has the opposite sign.

bigger quantitative impact on output and prices obviously obtain more weight in the
calculation of COV∆(k).
A set of impulse response functions provides complete information about the
comovements of output and prices after any type of shock. Estimating impulse response
functions, however, requires making identifying assumptions. The results often depend
on the particular type of identifying assumptions, and the assumptions are often ad hoc.
The advantage of the procedure proposed in this paper is that it does not require making
these types of ad hoc assumptions. The disadvantage of this procedure is that it does not
identify all the different impulse response functions.

3. Measuring correlations at different frequencies
This section describes how to use spectral analysis to decompose series by
frequency and to measure the correlations of two series at different frequencies.7 The
literature on frequency domain analysis typically assumes that the series of interest are
stationary. A short description of the relevant techniques is given in Section 3.1. In
contrast to some claims made in the literature, we show in Section 3.2 that the procedures
used in this paper can be easily extended to the case where the series are first or secondorder integrated processes, or the case where the series contain a deterministic linear or
quadratic time trend.
3.1 Frequency-domain filters for stationary processes
From the Wold-theorem, we know that any covariance stationary series has a
time-domain representation.8 Similarly, any covariance stationary series has a frequencydomain representation. Informally, this implies that the variable xt can be represented as
a weighted sum of periodic functions of the form cos(ωt) and sin(ωt), where ω denotes a
particular frequency. The frequency domain representation is given by
7

Diebold, Ohanian, and Berkowitz (1998) propose to compare the cross spectrum of the data with that of a
model. The procedure developed in this section is closer to the commonly used method of filtering the data
with the Hodrick-Prescott filter described in Hodrick and Prescott (1997) but like Diebold, Ohanian, and
Berkowitz (1998) we consider a more complete description of the data. Recall that the commonly used
version of the Hodrick-Prescott filter is an approximate high-pass filter that eliminates cycles with a
periodicity of more than 32 quarters.

e − iω j , − π ≤ ω ≤ π ,

j = −∞

where γj is the jth autocovariance and i2 = -1. The spectrum is useful in determining
which frequencies are important for the behavior of a stochastic variable. If the spectrum
has a peak at frequency ω = π/3, then the cycle with periodicity equal to 6 (= 2π / (π/3) )
periods is quantitatively important for the behavior of this stochastic variable.
Consider the following examples. If xt is white noise, then the spectrum is flat.
A flat spectrum indicates that all cycles are equally important for the behavior of the
variable xt. Intuitively, this makes sense because the existence of cycles implies
forecastibility, and white noise is, by definition, unforcastable. As a second example,
suppose that xt is an AR(1) with coefficient ρ, where 0 < ρ < 1. The spectrum for this
random variable has a peak at ω = 0 and is monotonically decreasing with |ω|. Since the
periodicity of a cycle with zero frequency is “infinite”, this stochastic process does not
have an observable cycle. Finally, suppose that the stochastic variable xt has a unit root,
then the spectrum would be infinite at frequency zero.
Baxter and King (1994) show how to construct filters that isolate specific
frequency bands, while removing stochastic and deterministic trends. Suppose one wants
to isolate that part of a stochastic variable xt that is associated with frequencies between

ω 1 and ω 2, with 0 < ω 1 < ω 2 ≤ π. If ω 2 = π, then the filter is called a high-pass filter
since all frequencies higher than ω 1 are included. If ω 2 < π, then the filter is called a
band-pass filter. The filters are two-sided symmetric linear filters and can be expressed
as follows.
xtF = B ( L) xt

(3.3)

where x tF is the filtered series, L is the lag operator, and

(3.4)

B( L) = ∑ bh Lh ,

with

bh = b− h .

8

Let the Wold-representation for xt be given by
(3.5)
Then,

xt = C ( L)ε t .

(3.6)

xtF = B ( L)C ( L)ε t .

A useful result in spectral analysis is that the spectrum of x tF is given by
S x F ( ω ) = |B ( e − i ω )|2 S x ( ω ),

(3.7)

where | B(e −iω ) | is the gain of the filter B(L). The spectrum of the filtered series x tF has
to be equal to Sx if |ω| ∈ [ω 1, ω 2] and equal to zero if ω is outside this set. Therefore, the
gain of the filter has to be equal to one if |ω| ∈ [ω 1, ω 2] and equal to zero otherwise.
Using the converse of the Riesz-Fischer theorem, one can find the time-series
representation, i.e. B(L), that corresponds to these conditions for the gain of the filter.
The formulas are as follows

practice one has to truncate B(L). This gives an approximate filter AH (L) , where
H

(3.9)

AH ( L) = ∑ ahH Lh ,
h=− H

and H is the truncation parameter.9 Note that a higher value of H means a more accurate
band-pass filter, but also the loss of more data points. The ideal filter B(L) has the
property that B(1) = 0. To ensure the same property for the feasible filter AH (L) , we
adjust the coefficients of AH (L) in such a way that they add up to zero. Let θ be equal to

Other approaches in the frequency domain also have to deal with the endpoints. The HP filter deals with
the endpoints by using a different filter for each observation in the sample. See Christiano and Den
Haan (1996) for a discussion. Engle (1974) points out that band spectrum regressions assume that the last
observation is at the same point in the cycle as the first observation.

Note that the distortion introduced by this adjustment approaches zero as H goes to
infinity.
3.2 Frequency-domain filters for non-stationary processes10
In this section, we analyze the properties of frequency-domain filters for more
general stochastic processes. In particular, we show that the properties derived in Section
3.1 remain valid when the input series are integrated stochastic processes or when the
input series have a linear or quadratic time trend. To prove this, we have to define the
spectrum of a non-stationary random process. Although most of the literature on spectral
analysis focuses on stationary processes, there are some exceptions. In fact, Hannan
(1970) and Priestley (1988) consider much more general non-stationary processes than
the ones considered in this section.
First, we will consider first-order integrated processes. When the series xt is
integrated, then the covariances used to define the spectrum in Equation (3.2) are not
well-defined. Therefore, we will define the spectrum of an integrated process as the limit
of the spectrum of a stationary stochastic process. The motivation for this definition is
the following. According to the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition, one can, under mild
regularity conditions, write an I(1) process as the sum of a random walk, initial
conditions, and a stationary process.11 Thus,
(3.12)

xt = xt −1 + et ,

where et is a stationary process. Consider the following “AR(1)-type” process:12
(3.13)

xt = ρ xt −1 + et or xt = [1/(1-ρL)] Se(ω).

Note that, as long as |ρ| < 1, the process defined in (3.13) is stationary and has a welldefined spectrum Sρ(ω) = | 1/(1-ρ e-iω) |2 Se(ω). Equation (3.12) can be written as:
(3.14)

xt = lim ρ →1 ρ xt −1 + et .

Equation (3.14) motivates the following definition of the spectrum of an I(1) process:

10

12

This section has benefited a lot from discussions with Clive Granger.
See, for example, Hamilton (1994).
This process is not necessarily an AR(1), since et could be serially correlated.

Since AH (L) is a symmetric filter with AH(1) = 0 we can write AH(L) as
(3.17)

AH(L) = (1-L) A H (L) with A H (1) = 0 .

Consequently, AH(L) has the property that it can make first-order integrated processes
stationary. Let xtF , H = AH(L) xt. We want to show that even when the law of motion for xt
is given by Equation (3.12) and xt is, thus, a first-order integrated process, the frequency
domain filter still correctly eliminates that part of the series associated with frequencies
outside the specified band. That is, we want to show for 0 < ω1 < ω2 ≤ π that13

for 0 < ω ≤ π . Since Sx(ω) is well-defined for all values of ω bigger than zero,
Equation (3.20) directly implies the desired result described in (3.18) for 0 < ω ≤ π. It
remains to be shown that S x F is equal to zero when ω is equal to zero. Because of (3.17)
we have that S x F ,H (0) is equal to zero for all H, which implies that
Note that calculating the spectrum of xF involves taking two limits, namely the limit as ρ → 1 and the
limit as H → ∝. In practice one would use a finite-order filter on integrated series and let the order of the
filter, H, increase as the sample size increases. Therefore, we first let ρ go to one and then let H go to
infinity.

Harvey and Jaeger (1993) and Cogley and Nason (1995) argue that the properties
of frequency-domain filters depend on the order of integration of the input series. This
clearly contradicts the analysis above. These papers reach a different conclusion because
they always focus on the stationary part of the series, although the filter is always applied
to the level. Consider, for example, the process
(3.22)

x t = ρ xt −1 +et ,

where et is an arbitrary stationary process. When |ρ| < 1, these papers compare the
filtered series B(L) xt with the stationary part of the series, i.e. xt. But, when ρ = 1, they
compare B(L) xt with the stationary part of the series, i.e. (1-L)xt. Thus, when |ρ| < 1,
they analyze the properties of the filter B(L), and when ρ = 1, they analyze the properties
of the filter B(L)/(1-L). Therefore, there is a discontinuity in the focus of their analysis
when ρ equals 1. We prefer the analysis above that uses the definition of the spectrum
for integrated processes. Note that if a researcher is interested in the first-difference of an
integrated process instead of the level he can, of course, apply the filter to ∆xt as opposed
to xt.
Now we turn our attention to second-order integrated processes. Since the filter
AH(L) is a symmetric filter it can be written as
(3.23)

AH(L) = (1-L) (1-L-1) A H (L) = -L-1 (1-L)2 A H (L) with A H (1) < ∞ .

Now Equation (3.20) would be equal to

Again, it immediately follows that the spectrum of xF is equal to the squared gain of the
filter B(L) times the spectrum of x for all ω > 0. As a consequence, the spectrum of xF is
equal to the spectrum of x for the included range of frequencies and equal to zero for the
excluded range of frequencies. However, since it is not necessarily true that A H (1) = 0

12

for second-order processes, it is no longer guaranteed that the spectrum of xF,H is equal to
zero at ω = 0. Hence, the result for second-order integrated processes is slightly less
general then the result for first-order integrated processes.
For finite-order filters, however, there might be another reason why it matters
whether the input series is integrated or not. Consider the approximation of the filter that
eliminates all frequencies below ω 1. The squared gain of the approximate filter is not
exactly equal to zero for frequencies less than ω 1, and not exactly equal to 1 for
frequencies bigger than ω 1. Since the spectrum of the filtered series is equal to the
squared gain times the spectrum of the input series, the approximation error may be
bigger for processes for which the value of the spectrum goes to infinity as the frequency
goes to zero—that is, for integrated processes.
To address this question, we calculate the spectrum of three stochastic processes
that are filtered using high-pass filters. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 document the results for the
high-pass filters that eliminate all cycles associated with periods bigger than 32 periods
and 10 periods, respectively. In addition to examining the ideal infinite-order high-pass
filter, we also consider two approximate filters with truncation parameters equal to 20
and 40. Panel A in Figures 3.1 and 3.2 presents the results for the case where the process
is a white noise process. Panel B reports the results for the second process, an AR(1) with
a coefficient equal to 0.95. Finally, Panel C reports the results for the third process, an
integrated AR(1) with a coefficient equal to 0.4. The variance of the white noise process
in Panel A is chosen in such a way that the spectrum of the filtered series presented in
Panel A is equal to the squared gain of the filter used in Panels A, B, and C.

As documented in the graph, for all stochastic processes the approximation is
better for the frequencies that are less than ω 1 than for the frequencies just above ω 1.
Also, the approximation errors are bigger for the two serially correlated processes than
for the white noise process. This suggests that the truncation parameter that one uses
should depend on the persistence of the underlying process; i.e., a higher truncation
parameter is needed for more persistent processes. The graph also shows that the study
of approximation errors does not reveal a fundamental difference between the persistent
stationary process and the integrated process studied here. For example, for K equal to
40 and ω 1 equal to π/5, the peak of the approximated spectrum is 14% and 12% less than
the peak of the true spectrum for the stationary persistent process and the integrated
process, respectively.
Now suppose that the series xt has a linear time trend. That is, xt can be written as
(3.25)

xt = b t + yt,

where yt is a stationary or integrated process. When one applies the filter AH(L) and uses
the results shown in (3.17), then
xtF , H = A H ( L) xt = A H (1)b + A H ( L) yt

(3.26)
and

S x F (ω ) = S y (ω ) if ω 1≤ ω ≤ ω 2 ,and

(3.27)

S x F (ω ) = 0 if ω < ω1 ,ω > ω 2 .

Thus, the filter removes a linear trend, and (3.18) holds for the non-deterministic part of
the series. When one uses a finite-order filter to approximate B(L), then one can use the
results in (3.23), and the filter will also take out a quadratic time trend.
4. Empirical results
In this section, we discuss the empirical comovements between prices and output
during the postwar period for the G7 countries. We use both monthly data for industrial
production and the CPI index, and quarterly data for GDP and its deflator. Details about
data sources and sample periods are given in Appendix A. In Section 4.1, we discuss the
results for the VAR forecast errors and in Section 4.2 we discuss the results for the
frequency domain filters.

16

4.1 Comovement of prices and output using VAR forecast errors
In this section, we discuss the comovement of prices and output using the VAR
forecast errors. But instead of using the actual realized VAR forecast errors as in Den
Haan (2000), we use the correlation coefficients implied by the estimated VAR
coefficients and the estimated covariance matrix of the VAR residuals. In Appendix B,
we document the efficiency gains of using this alternative procedure. First, we will
discuss the results when the monthly CPI index and industrial production is used and then
we will discuss the results when quarterly GDP and its deflator are used.

Note: This figure plots the correlation coefficients of the k-period ahead price and output forecast errors of a monthly VAR when a
unit root is imposed in the estimation. The open circles indicate that the estimate is significant at the 10% level and the filled-in circles
indicate that the estimate is significant at the 5% level. The sample period is from 1957 (from 1958 for Germany) to 1999 (to 1998 for
Italy). See Appendix A for details.

estimation of the VAR.15 For all G7 countries the correlation coefficients at long-term
forecast horizons are negative and significantly so at either the 5% or 10% level for all
countries except Italy. Moreover, for all countries the short-term correlation coefficients
are substantially higher. For France, Italy, and the US there are short-term positive
correlation coefficients at either the 5% or 10% significance level. Furthermore, these
results are robust to relaxing the unit root restriction in the estimation of the VAR. The
main difference between the specifications imposing a unit root and those not imposing a
unit root is that, when no unit-root is imposed in the estimation of the VAR, all countries
(including Italy) display significant negative long-term correlation coefficients at the 5%
significance level and the (negative) short-run correlation coefficients for Canada are no
longer significant.
Panel A of Figure 4.2 plots the comovement of quarterly GDP and its deflator for
the longest sample period for which we have data for all seven countries, that is, from the
first quarter of 1970 to the last quarter of 1999. Again a unit root is imposed in the
estimation of the VAR. There are some similarities and some differences with the CPI
and industrial production data. For all countries the long-term correlation coefficients are
negative. Furthermore, for all countries except Italy and Germany, the long-term
correlation coefficients are significant at either the 5% or the 10% level. Also, the results
are somewhat less robust to not imposing a unit root. For example, without the unit-root
restriction the Italian correlation coefficients become negative for forecast horizons
longer than 2 years, but the German correlation coefficients are no longer negative for
forecast horizons between 2 and 6 years, although both effects are insignificant. As
demonstrated in Panel B of Figure 4.2, the results change for some countries when we
consider the full sample. For Japan, the UK, and the US the long-term correlation
coefficients remain significantly negative, but the US now shows evidence of positive
short-run correlation coefficients. Both Canada and Germany now show (insignificant)
positive correlation coefficients.16

15

The figures presented in this paper are all based on VARs estimated in first differences. See
Appendix A for a description of the unit-root tests.
16
For France and Italy the longest available sample period is from 1970 to 1999.

Note: These figures plot the correlation coefficients of the k-period ahead price and output forecast error of a quarterly VAR estimated
over the indicated sample period when a unit root is imposed in the estimation. The open circles indicate that the estimate is
significant at the 10% level and the filled-in circles indicate that the estimate is significant at the 5% level. The full sample period is
from 1957:1 to 2000:2 for Canada and the U.K., from 1960:1 to 2000:2 for Germany, from 1947:1 to 2000:2 for the U.S., and from
1955:2 to 1999:4 for Japan. See Appendix A for details.

19

To understand better what time periods are mainly responsible for the observed
correlation pattern, we plot in Figure 4.3 a two-sided six-quarter moving average of the
cross product of the quarterly price and output forecast errors for the four-year ahead
forecast period.17 For each country we use forecast errors from the VAR estimated with
the longest possible sample. Several interesting observations can be made. First, it is
clear from the graph that there are factors hitting the different countries at the same time
and in the same way, but that the correlation across countries is far from perfect. Second,
it is clear that the seventies play a major role in contributing to the magnitude of several
of the negative correlation coefficients, although a quantitatively important negative
long-run comovement is also present in the early eighties for Canada, France, Italy, the
UK, and the US. In fact, for this set of countries and this forecast horizon, the moving
average is not often above zero.18 Third, in the seventies there was no negative
comovement in Canada, Germany, and Italy. Canada experienced strong economic
growth in the early seventies and experienced a reduction in economic growth that was
mild compared to what was observed in the other countries. Although Germany did
show a considerable reduction in real growth rates, inflation rates did not rise in the
seventies. Italy experienced a strong increase in real growth rates and inflation rates in
the early seventies. When the oil crises lead Italy into a recession, inflation rates in fact
first decreased. Inflation rates in Italy only started to increase again, when economic
growth started to recover. Finally, in the middle of the eighties there was a long-run
positive comovement in Canada, France, Italy, and the UK and to some extent Germany
and the US. Although the sample is too short to say anything definitive, the last two
findings suggest that the correlation between prices and output could very well be timevarying and depend on the particular circumstances and economic institutions of the
particular country, and the time period.19

17

At other forecast horizons and for the monthly data the graphs displayed more noise and less interesting
patterns. Davis and Kanago (2000) look at the cross products of one-quarter ahead forecast errors for
Canada, the UK, and the US.
18
Results not shown here document the positive correlation coefficients at short-term forecast horizons are
due to positive cross products in the fifties and sixties.
19
An interesting paper that estimates the conditional covariance of the one-quarter ahead forecast errors of
GDP and its deflator is Cover and Hueng (2000).

Note: This figure plots a two-sided 6th-order moving average of the cross product of the 4-year ahead forecast errors of the price level
and output. A unit root was imposed in the estimation of the (monthly) VAR. The sample period is from 1957:1 to 2000:2 for Canada
and the U.K., from 1960 to 2000:2 for Germany, from 1947:1 to 2000:2 for the U.S., and from 1955:2 to 1999:4 for Japan, from
1970:1 to 2000:1 for France, and from 1970:1 to 1999:4 for Italy. See Appendix A for details.

4.2 Comovement of prices and output using frequency-domain filters
In this section, we analyze the comovement of prices and output using frequency
domain filters. Den Haan (2000) argues that the sign of the correlation coefficient of
filtered prices and output may not have as much identifying power20 but, of course, that
does not mean that the actual numerical values of these correlation coefficients provide
any less information. In Figure 4.4, we plot the correlation coefficients of (monthly) CPI
and industrial production when frequency domain filters have been used to render the
data stationary. Panel A reports the results for the high-pass filters where the filter
isolates that part of the series associated with cycles that have a periodicity less than the
indicated periodicity. Panel B reports the results for the band-pass filters where the filter
20

Because negative correlation coefficients for filtered price and output series are consistent with models
that only have demand shocks and models that have both demand and supply shocks. In contrast, negative
correlation coefficients of VAR forecast errors cannot be generated by models with only demand shocks
unless unreasonable assumptions are made.

21

isolates that part of the series associated with cycles that have the indicated periodicities.
The truncation parameter H was set equal to 60, which means that five years of data are
discarded at both sides of the sample. For smaller values of H the results are sensitive to
changes in H. The following observations can be made. First, consistent with the results
for the VAR forecast errors we find for all countries that the long-run correlation
coefficients are negative and they are significant at the 5% significance level for five of
the seven countries. As shown in Panel B, when band-pass filters are used the correlation
coefficients are significantly negative for all countries when the periodicity of the
included frequencies exceeds four and one-half years and typically earlier. Second, for
all countries the short-term correlations are substantially higher than the long-term
correlation coefficients. Using high-pass filters, positive correlation coefficients are
observed for France, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US and significant positive correlation
coefficients at the 10% level are observed for France, Italy and the US.
In Figure 4.5, we plot the correlation coefficients of quarterly GDP and its
deflator when a high-pass filter has been used to filter the data both for the sample from
1970 to 1999 (Panel A) and for the full sample (Panel B). The truncation parameter is set
equal to 20 so that again 5 years of data are discarded at both ends of the sample. The
main conclusion to be drawn from Figure 4.5 is that there is substantial evidence of
negative correlation coefficients. Also, just as we found with the VAR forecast errors,
there is evidence of positive comovement in Italy for the 1970-99 sample period.

Note: These figures plot the correlation coefficients of filtered monthly price and output series using the indicated filter. The high-pass
filter isolates that part of the series associated with cycles with a periodicity that is less than the indicated periodicity. The band-pass
filter isolates that part of the series associated with cycles with the indicated periodicity. The open circles indicate that the estimate is
significant at the 10% level and the filled-in circles indicate that the estimate is significant at the 5% level. Standard errors are
calculated using the VARHAC procedure proposed in Den Haan and Levin (1996). The sample period is from 1957 (from 1958 for
Germany) to 1999 (to 1998 for Italy).

Note: These figures plot for the indicated sample period the correlation coefficients of filtered quarterly price and output series, where
an (approximate) high-pass filter is used to isolate that part of the series associated with cycles with a periodicity that is less than the
indicated periodicity. The open circles indicate that the estimate is significant at the 10% level and the filled-in circles indicate that the
estimate is significant at the 5% level. Standard errors are calculated using the VARHAC procedure proposed in Den Haan and Levin
(1996). The full sample period is from 1957:1 to 2000:2 for Canada and the U.K., from 1960:1 to 2000:2 for Germany, from 1947:1 to
2000:2 for the U.S., and from 1955:2 to 1999:4 for Japan. See Appendix A for details.

5. Concluding comments
The results in this paper clearly provide more evidence for negative correlation
coefficients than for positive correlation coefficients. For some countries there is some
evidence of a positive short-run correlation coefficient during some sample periods and
for some price and output measures. The paper also shows that the observed negative
correlation coefficients are not just due to the price and output movements during the oil
crisis of the seventies when prices soared and output dropped in many countries.
Moreover, during that same period there did not seem to be a negative comovement of
prices and output in Canada, Germany, and Italy. This suggests that the correlation
between prices and output may very well be time varying and depend on, for example,
the particular monetary policies being followed. Support for the assertion that the
comovement is time varying can also be found in the observation that in the middle of the
eighties there was a long-run positive comovement in Canada, France, Italy, and the UK,
and to some extent, in Germany and the US, even though this comovement is typically
negative.

Appendix A: Data sources and time-series properties
In this appendix, we describe the data sources and sample periods necessary to
duplicate all the results in this paper. The actual period for which correlation coefficients
are calculated is shorter, since the estimation of the VAR and the use of frequency filters
reduces the length of the sample period. We also provide the results of unit-root and
cointegration tests performed on the data and the VAR specifications used in the
calculations.

23
Real and nominal Gross Domestic Product is in billions of units of the country’s national currency,
except for Italy, which is in trillions of units of Italy’s national currency.
24
Various versions of the series are spliced together to create the complete time series. The series version
is represented by the next to last character in the series code. Canada, France, Germany, and Italy use
versions Y and Z. Additionally, France uses version X. The United States and the United Kingdom use
only version Z. The most current observations were updated directly from the IFS monthly publication,
including those for Japan.

A trend break in real and nominal GDP in Germany 1990:4/1991:1 was adjusted by multiplying the
observations before the break by AVE(t)*ANNUAL(t-1)/(AVE(t-1)*ANNUAL(t)), where AVE(t) is the
year t average of the quarterly series with a trend break, and ANNUAL(t), is the year t observation of the
available annual series without a trend break.

the estimated OLS autoregressive coefficient. Four lags have been included in the regression
along with a constant and linear trend. When the null of a unit root is rejected at the 10% (5%,
1%) level, it is indicated with a * (**,***). See Hamilton (1994) for a description of these
tests.

Appendix B: Efficiency gains of imposing VAR restrictions
In this appendix, we summarize the efficiency gains that can be made by
imposing the VAR restrictions. Den Haan (2000) calculates the correlation coefficient of
VAR forecast errors by constructing a time series of forecast errors and calculating the
sample correlation coefficients. But, as was shown in Section 2.1, the estimated VAR
directly implies a particular correlation coefficient. Using a VAR as the true data
generating process, we performed the following Monte Carlo analysis. For each Monte
Carlo replication we used the generated data to calculate the correlation coefficient with
both procedures. After all 10,000 Monte Carlo replications are completed we calculate
the bias and the Mean Squared Error. Such a Monte Carlo experiment was performed
using virtually all estimated VARs as the true DGP. Since the results were very similar
we present here just a summary of the results. In particular, Figure B.1 shows the bias
and the (square root of the) mean squared error averaged across the seven countries for
the VAR estimated with the monthly CPI and industrial production data over the full
sample. The results in panel B confirm our conjecture that imposing the VAR restrictions
leads to substantial efficiency gains especially in estimating the correlation coefficients
for the long-term forecast horizons. This despite the fact that imposing the constraints
typically increases the bias as documented in panel A. Given that the VAR coefficients
are biased estimates and the correlation coefficients are non-trivial functions of these
coefficients, it isn’t easy to understand the source of the bias. It seems plausible to us that
the method that imposes the VAR restrictions has a larger bias because it makes more use
of the estimated VAR coefficients in calculating the correlation coefficients.

Note: The “old method” referred to in the legend calculates the correlation coefficients using the realized forecast errors as in Den
Haan (2000). The “new method” referred to in the legend calculates the correlation coefficient by imposing the VAR restrictions and
using the estimated VAR coefficients.
