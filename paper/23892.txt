Pareto Efficient Taxation and Expenditures: Pre- and Re-distribution
Joseph E. Stiglitz
NBER Working Paper No. 23892
September 2017
JEL No. E2,H2,H41,H52,I24
ABSTRACT
This paper shows that there is a presumption that Pareto efficient taxation entails a positive tax on
capital. When tax and expenditure policies can affect the market distribution of income in ways
that cannot be directly offset, those effects need to be taken into account, reducing the burden
imposed on distortionary redistribution. The paper extends the 1976 Atkinson-Stiglitz results to a
dynamic, overlapping generations model, correcting a misreading of the result on the desirability
of a zero capital tax. That result required separability of consumption from labor and that the only
unobservable differences among individuals were in (fixed) labor productivities. In a general
equilibrium model, one needs to take into account the effects of policy changes on binding selfselection constraints. In a simple model with time separability but with non-separability between
consumption and leisure, capital taxation depends on the complementarity/substitutability of
leisure during work with retirement consumption.
The final section constructs a simple two class model, capitalists who maximize dynastic welfare
and workers who save for retirement, whose productivity can be enhanced by (publicly provided)
education. It derives a simple expression for the optimal capital tax, which is positive, so long as
the social welfare function is sufficiently equalitarian and the productivity of educational
expenditures are sufficiently high.

Pareto Efficient Taxation and Expenditures: Pre- and Re-distribution 1
Joseph E. Stiglitz
Beginning with my supervision of Tony Atkinson in Cambridge in 1965-1966 while I was a junior
research fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Tony and I enjoyed a close collaboration and
friendship. One of our early results that received a great deal of attention was that when there
was separability in the utility function between consumption and leisure 2, if there existed an
optimal income tax, it was optimal to have no commodity taxation (Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1976).
An immediate corollary of that result was that, under the stipulated conditions, there should be
no tax on interest income—treating consumption at different dates as different commodities.
This and similar results from optimal tax theory were seized upon as a basis of policy by those
critical of capital taxation. 3 Those who did so typically did not understand (or did not want to
understand) the limitations of the model. As always, one has to look carefully at the
assumptions going into a model to judge whether they provide an appropriate basis for policy.
This paper argues that even within the confines of a model in which differences in labor
productivity are the only source of differences in income, the conclusion that there should be no
capital taxation is, in general wrong, even in the presence of separability, and that in a plausible

dedicated to his memory. It develops ideas on which we worked jointly together, and I am greatly indebted to
him. In particular, it elaborates ideas originally presented in Atkinson and Stiglitz (1972, 1976) and further
developed in Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980) and Stiglitz (1982, 1987, 1998, 2009a.) In recent years, there has been
marked progress on the issues raised in our 1976 paper. While this paper presents a unifying approach addressing
e g. the circumstances in which a tax on interest income is desirable, deriving a number of new results and putting
a new perspective on some earlier derived results, it does not intend to provide a comprehensive review of the
literature that AS 1976 spawned.

That is, utility U could be written U= U(u(C), L) where C is the vector of consumption goods and L is labor supply.
We do not require additive separability.

See, for instance, Mankiw et al (2009) and Atkeson et al. (1999). Using a quite different framework, with
individuals with infinite lives, Chamley (1986) has also concluded that the optimal tax rate on capital should be
zero in the long run. In section II, we consider a social welfare maximization problem extending infinitely far into
the future, but using an overlapping generations model, and show that his results obtains if and only if there is
separability in the utility function between labor and consumption. Later sections, present still more general
frameworks, showing that even with separability, results on asymptotic zero capital taxation are not general.

model where individuals differ as well in the amount of inherited capital, there is a presumption
for a possibly quite high tax on income from capital.
This paper is divided into eight parts. The first presents some general reflections on our
1976 paper, our motivations in writing it, what we saw as some of the limitations, and some of
the important extensions of the result in the subsequent literature. The second presents the
basic model, based on Stiglitz (1982a), including some straightforward but important extensions
to Pigouvian taxation and the provision of public goods. In both cases, in the case of
separability, results much more akin to those that arise when government can impose out of
lump sum taxes than to those generated when government relies on distortionary Ramsey
results obtain. For instance, the sum of the marginal rate of substitution equals the marginal
rate of transformation. In the standard Ramsey-Diamond-Mirrlees model with public goods
with distortionary taxation, the Samuelson condition for optimal supply (1955, 1958), that the
marginal rate of transformation (MRT) equal the sum of the marginal rates of substitution
(MRS) is altered, and instead MRT < Σ MRS, the marginal rate of transformation is less than the
sum of the sum of the marginal rate of substitution; and the level of consumption of public
goods is reduced.4 Section 2 shows that the Samuelsonian condition is restored with optimal
non-linear taxation, provided there is separability between labor and consumption goods. 5
Similarly, first best Pigouvian taxation is optimal with separability either between leisure and
consumption, or between the externality on the one hand and consumption and labor on the
other, though in the latter case, the Pigouvian tax has to be interpreted as the tax in excess of
the optimal commodity tax (the shadow price.) 6
To analyze optimal interest taxation in general equilibrium, once has to construct a
dynamic general equilibrium model. Section 3 does this, embedding optimal non-linear
taxation in a general equilibrium overlapping generations model. While Atkinson and Sandmo
(1980) had extended the Atkinson-Stiglitz (1972) model to a similar overlapping generations
See Pigou (1947), Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1971) and Atkinson and Stern (1974). Atkinson and Stern make the
important point that one cannot infer from the fact that the sum of the MRT < Σ MRS the impact of distortionary
taxation on the supply of public goods.

Boadway and Kean (1993), using the Stiglitz (1982b) framework for the analysis of optimal taxation, had noted
this result earlier. See also Kaplow (1996).

Kaplow (2006a) had noted the former result. Sandmo (1975) had established that one could obtain results that
were closely akin to first best Pigouvian taxes even in a Ramsey-Diamond-Mirrlees model.

setting, this paper, a development of Stiglitz (1985), provides the corresponding extension of
Atkinson-Stiglitz (1976). The conclusion of Atkinson and Sandmo (1980) was that “it is difficult
to make a strong case either for the expenditure tax or for taxing interest income at the same
rate as wage income.” By contrast, we find that the basic results of our static model extend to
this dynamic framework: (a) With separability, and fixed relative productivities, there should
be no taxation of capital income provided that relative wages are either observable or
unaffected by taxation or investment (by the consumption/labor supplies which they induce) ;
but (b) in the absence of separability between consumption and leisure, but with intertemporal
separability, whether there should be an interest income tax or subsidy depends on whether
first period consumption is a complement or substitute for leisure. 7 But both separability and
the italicized proviso are crucial. While the latter result is reminiscent of that of Corlett and
Hague (1953) (in a model with no income taxation and just commodity taxation), we establish it
in the presence of an optimal non-linear income tax. (This is important, because in many
causes, the presence of one tax—in particular an income tax—changes markedly the taxes that
should be imposed elsewhere in the system; for reasons we explain, often with unconstrained
non-linear taxes, results that hold only with lump sum taxes are stored.)As a prelude to the
later discussion of public investment in the next section, the section also extends the analysis
shows that the standard result on the desirability of productive efficiency holds.
The rest of the paper then provides a critique of the Atkinson-Stiglitz (1976) result. The
fourth section focuses on the case where relative wages are not fixed. Even with separability
between labor and consumption, (a) it is in general desirable to impose distortionary
commodity taxation, even on high ability individuals; (b) there should be a distortionary income
tax, even on high ability individuals; (c) there should be an interest income tax (or subsidy),
even on high ability individuals; (d) productive efficiency of the economy (where there is no
production taxes and the marginal rate of transformation of all goods is the same amongst all
firms) is not desirable 8; (e) even asymptotically, the rate of return on public capital goods may
Similar in spirit to the Corlett and Hague (1953) analysis.
One of the important results in Diamond-Mirrlees (1971) was establishing that optimal taxation entailed only
consumption taxes, no production taxes, and that the economy was productively efficient. Dasgupta and Stiglitz
(1971, 1972) had established this was not so in the standard Diamond-Mirrlees model, but with restricted taxation
(i.e. the government could not impose 100% taxes on pure rents or profits and could impose taxes on all goods and

not equal either the pure rate of time discount or the rate of return on private goods; the long
run return to some kinds of public capital may be lower than the social discount rate.
Recent policy discussions have suggested the desirability of focusing on policies which
improve the market distribution of income, leaving less of a burden on redistribution. 9
Standard models which assume that relative wages are fixed cannot address this issue. Our
analysis establishes that this intuition is correct. In each of the cases listed above, taxes and
expenditures are adjusted at the margin to increase wages of the low skilled relative to the high
skilled. 10 Formally, the improvement in the distribution of income loosens the binding selfselection constraint, allowing for a Pareto improvement.
The optimal tax literature developed in the context of an economy of seemingly selfemployed individuals, say making widgets. The only information problem was that of the
government, who, seeing the output of widgets (or income from producing widgets) could not
tell whether a high output was the result of hard work (long hours) or high ability. But most
individuals in a modern economy work for others, and employers have an analogous
information problem to that of government: they seek to discriminate among individuals,
including by using self-selection mechanisms. But private screening is affected by public tax
policy, and optimal taxation needs to take this into account. Section 5 does this, again showing
that the Atkinson-Stiglitz (1976) result may not hold, even with separability.
Sections 6 and 7 consider optimal taxation with inheritances. Inheritances mean that
individuals differ not just in their labor productivity, and optimal taxation ought to take that
into account. This is so even in a world with dynastic families optimally sharing their wealth
with their children. We show that the appropriate public policy response is taxation of
inheritances and the return to capital. But the design of capital taxation is more nuanced than
populist calls might suggest: careful attention has to be paid to incidence. A simplistic call for
capital taxation with proceeds distributed to workers may actually leave workers worse off. In
a simple two class model (workers and capitalists), we derive a simple formula for optimal
services at differential rates). The result here generalizes that of Naito (1999), whose analysis built on Stiglitz
(1982a)

The real argument behind the taxation of capital almost surely is related to disparities in
inherited capital and in disparities in the ability to obtain returns out of capital—and luck—than
with differences in productivities amongst workers, the subject of our 1976 paper.
Section 8 provides some concluding remarks, including putting the results presented
here into some broader perspectives.
I.

Reflections on the Atkinson-Stiglitz Theorem

Our analysis was motivated in part as a critique of Ramsey taxation (Ramsey, 1927), which
seemed to justify not just high taxes on basic necessities like food (which had a low elasticity of
demand) but also patterns of pricing by monopolies like A T & T.11 Ramsey had established that
optimal commodity taxes should be inversely related to the elasticity of demand and to the
elasticity of supply in a model in which everyone was identical; hence there were no
distributional concerns—and therefore a lump sum tax would have been presumably
acceptable). Our 1972 paper (Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1972) had shown that in the absence of an
income tax, optimal commodity taxes could be described by a simple Ramsey-like formula
incorporating distributional effects, which suggested that when distributional concerns were
given sufficient weight (for instance, in a society with a high level of both inequality and
inequality aversion) goods like food with a low price elasticity of demand but a low income
elasticity of demand would not be taxed at a high rate, but rather, that luxuries like perfume
might face high rates, even though they have a higher price elasticity than food. We were,
however, never satisfied with that result, since it was obvious that we had an income tax, the
intent of which was at least partly redistributive.12 The question was, given the existence of
such a redistributive income tax, was commodity taxation still desirable? Our 1976 paper
yielded stronger results than we had anticipated.

See, e.g. Baumol and Bradford (1970) and Boiteux (1956). Elsewhere, David Sappington and Stiglitz (1987)
explained while there was some similarities between the two problems, there were also some critical differences.
12
Our 1972 results would, presumably, still be relevant for developing countries and emerging markets in which
income taxation played little role, though in many such economies other considerations (such as migration and
rural/urban income differences) play an important role. See Sah and Stiglitz (1992).

Another of the motivations behind our paper was to demonstrate two general results in
the general theory of screening in the context of optimal taxation:
(a) In general, the optimal commodity taxes depended on the set of other taxes that
were available 13. Ramsey (1927) and Diamond Mirrlees (1971) analyses clearly depended on
the absence of lump sum taxes. With lump sum taxes, they would be employed, and the
optimal commodity taxes would be zero. Some of the Diamond-Mirrlees results, both on
production efficiency (not using producer taxes) and the structure of taxation were shown to be
undermined if there were profits (rents) which could not be taxed directly at 100% 14(Dasgupta
and Stiglitz, 1971, 1972). Our 1976 paper (Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1976) thus explored the
interaction between an (optimal) income tax and commodity taxation.
(b) The optimal income tax problem was at its heart a standard problem in asymmetric
information with adverse selection. We assumed that individuals differed only in their abilities
to perform work, and they all had the same endowment of time and the same utility functions.
The Mirrlees’ optimal tax problem could be thought of as extracting information about those
differences efficiently as one raised tax revenues. Even though there was a single “dimension”
in which individuals differed (ability), in general, it seemed possible that one could extract
information about that difference more efficiently by looking not just at the individual’s labor
supply, but also at his consumption patterns. While that conjecture turned out to be true in
general, in the special case of separability, Pareto efficient taxation required only an income
tax; there was no benefit to be had by using information about consumption patterns.
We never thought that the separability assumption was plausible. It meant that there
were no goods that were complementary to leisure. Clearly, the marginal rate of substitution
between skis and say food depends on the amount of leisure. Someone with no leisure time
simply doesn’t value skiing much. Thus, we never attached much weight to the result that
there should be no tax on capital with separability.
There are a set of parallel questions in the more general theory of incentives and selection with asymmetric
information. For instance, the design of the optimal sharecropping contract is affected by the ability of the
landlord to affect credit, the purchase of inputs, and the choice of technology. See Braverman and Stiglitz (1982,
1986a, 1986b).
14
See Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1971, 1972). They thus reconcile the Diamond-Mirrlees results, where supply
elasticities play no role, and Ramsey’s analysis, where they are central. Dasgupta and Stiglitz also show that other
restrictions on taxation fundamentally change optimal tax structures, including the desirability of efficiency.
13

But this was not the only, or even the most important, reason that our theorem did not
provide the basis of policy for capital taxation. For instance, if individuals differed in other
ways—as in fact they do, in their level of inherited capital and their ability to earn returns on
capital— it was possible that capital taxation was desirable, even if the separability assumption
held. Indeed, it is not hard to generate more general plausible models in which capital taxation
is clearly desirable. Showing this is one of the main objectives of this paper.
Thus, in section 8, we consider a simple model, which perhaps captures key aspects of
the sources of inequality which give rise to the desirability of capital taxation far better than
generalizations of Atkinson-Stiglitz (1976) discussed earlier in the paper. We assume that there
are two classes of individuals—a group of capitalists with large endowments of capital who
invest their capital, earn returns, consume, and leave bequests to their children, and workers-with the capitalists sufficiently richer than the workers that the social marginal utility of a dollar
to the capitalists is negligible. 15 It is obvious that in such a situation the optimal utilitarian 16 tax
on capitalists is close to a Rawlsian tax, maximizing the revenue that one could obtain from a
tax on capital 17. It is clear that the optimal capital tax is significantly greater than zero, and
considerable evidence that it is far higher than the current tax on capital, especially the tax on
capital gains. 18
There are other “thought” experiments that help us understand the role of capital
taxation, and why in general it should be positive. Consider, for instance, a simple model in
which all members of a group of individuals have an equal endowment of capital, but some
individuals are better at transforming a unit input of capital into output (i.e., they are better at
selecting good projects.) Assume that the more effort an individual exerts, the higher income;
This model is a generalization of Stiglitz (2015) and Mattauch et al (2016, 2017). It many ways, it formalizes the
model that is implicit in Piketty (2015), building on Stiglitz (1969a).
16
In the discussion below, we often refer to results based on a utilitarian social welfare function, such as that
employed by Mirrlees (1971). But virtually all of the results would hold for any individualistic inequality averse
social welfare function, e.g. along the lines discussed in Rothschild and Stiglitz (1973), and indeed, for any Pareto
efficient tax structure (Stiglitz, 1987; Brito et al 1990).
17
It is easy to design capital taxes that effectively tax only the capital income of capitalists, e.g. exempting life cycle
savings or taxing only the returns on capital above a certain level. (In this model, there is great inequality in the
ownership and returns to capital.) The analytics sometimes turn out simpler for a general tax on capital.
18
Especially in countries like the United States, where there is a step-up-in-basis at death, resulting in capital gains
not being taxed at all. There are a wide range of ways by which through tax planning high income individuals can
reduce their taxes. See Stiglitz 1985b.

and that there is disutility associated with the exertion of effort.19 Then the optimal tax
structure for this group would be parallel to that which we analyzed in our paper: with
separability between the utility of goods and effort, then the optimal tax is only a tax on capital
income. In the absence of separability, both goods taxes/subsidies and a capital tax are
desirable.
With individuals having equal endowments of both capital and labor, with full
separability (of consumption from effort and labor, and effort and labor from each other), but
differing in both the ability to transform labor and capital into “income,” if one can separately
identify income from labor and from capital 20, optimal taxation involves separate non-linear
taxation of capital income and labor income, but no commodity taxation; but even with
separability of consumption from effort and labor, but effort and labor not being separable
from each other, then matters are far more complicated. While there would still be no indirect
taxation, in general, taxes would not just be a function of total income.21
Of course, some individuals have larger endowments of wealth. If such wealth were
observable, a utilitarian would want to impose a lump sum tax on it. If the supply of that
wealth were elastic—parents’ transfers to children could be affected by the taxes imposed on
the transfer or assets or the after-tax income generated—then there might be a trade-off, with
Note that if the higher returns of some individuals is just a result of luck, then “excess” returns (i.e. returns
above the average) should be fully taxed, since there is no adverse incentive effects. The same thing is true if the
higher returns are a result of just inherited ability or better connections. (Such taxes could, of course, affect the
incentives of those providing “connections,” if it is costly to do so or if the benefit to the “gift” of the giver depends
on the amount the recipient receives after tax. See section 5 below.) In each of these cases, the desirability of a
highly progressive capital tax is obvious. Here, we make the equally obvious point: if there is an unobservable
variable, effort, that together with ability, determines returns to capital, there should be a progressive tax along
the lines of that analyzed in the optimal (labor) income tax literature. There is one difference: If we assume that
total returns, R, are a function of capital, K, ability, a, and effort, e, R =R (e, K, a, ϵ ), where ϵ is a random
variable, and Utility is a function of consumption and effort (but not of K), then there is an additional variable we
have to deal with. (It is as if individuals had different endowments of time.) If K is observable, then taxes paid
would be a function of {K , R}. This model is formally identical to the standard one when K is the same for all
individuals, there is no variability (ϵ is fixed) and e is not fixed. If everyone had the same K and a , we would have
the standard moral hazard model. With K fixed (observable), but ϵ variable, individuals’ differing in a , and e not
fixed, then we have the standard moral hazard cum adverse selection model, where both self-selection and
incentive compatibility constraints have to be taken into account. This changes some of the standard results that
have been obtained in models with pure adverse selection. See Stiglitz and Yun (2013).
20
Note that for small businesses, tax authorities cannot separately identify income from capital and labor. At best
they can impute income from capital.

Let W = wage income, C = capital income, and T be total taxes paid. The optimal tax function T(W, C) is not of
the form T = T(W +C).

higher tax rates generating more tax revenue but leading to less accumulation and transfer of
wealth. Even a Rawlsian would impose a tax that was less than 100%. It may be that the actual
value of the wealth transfer is not observable, but only the income generated by it. Then there
is no presumption that the optimal tax (whatever the social welfare function) on the income
generated by that wealth would be taxed at zero. Quite the contrary: there is a presumption
that it would be taxed, and possibly at high rates.
Taxing capital goods and rents
Moreover, the result that one does not want to tax the returns to individuals is often
confused with not taxing the returns to particular assets or corporations. If land is inelastically
supplied, there is nothing in our analysis that undermines the conventional result that one
would want to tax the returns on that asset at a very high rate (100%) (George, 1879). 22 The
price of the asset would fall, to reflect the tax. Indeed, more recent results—extending the
overlapping generations model as exposited in Atkinson-Stiglitz (1980) to include land as an
asset—note that since land crowds out capital, a tax on land leads to a higher steady state level
of capital (per capita) and thus to higher levels of income.23 All that the Atkinson-Stiglitz
theorem said was that (under the stipulated conditions) one should not tax the returns received
by the individual.
Risk
We (along with most of the subsequent literature) ignored uncertainty. This was an
important omission. In a world in which there are imperfect risk markets, Domar and Musgrave
(1944) 24 had already shown that an income tax with appropriate loss offsets could encourage
risk taking. With, say, expensing of capital goods, the government entered as a silent partner.
The government was in a better position to absorb risk than the firm or individual: it could

For a more modern rendition, see Arnott and Stiglitz (1979, 1981).
This is a result obtained earlier in models with money and capital accumulation (see, e.g. Shell, Sidrauski, and
Stiglitz (1969)). For more recent and general results, see Stiglitz (2015, 2017).
24
Their analysis was put into modern expected utility form by Stiglitz (1969b). See also Piketty and Saez (2013)
who explain how if there is uninsurable uncertainty about future returns, capital taxation can be viewed as
providing insurance against returns. (The older literature emphasized the importance of loss offsets.)

spread risk over all of society. (Arrow and Linn, 1970, 2014). 25 If the tax rate was τ, the
government picked up τ per cent of the costs, taking in turn τ percent of the returns. The
expected marginal return per dollar invested was thus unchanged. But taking account of risk,
the tax actually led to more investment.26 A utilitarian government would again want to
impose a capital income tax. Indeed, it would be part of Pareto efficient taxation.
Extending Atkinson-Stiglitz
There were two natural extensions to our analysis: to ask whether there were more
general conditions under which commodity taxation was not necessary, and to ask whether the
result remained true with an income tax that was not the optimal non-linear tax, e.g. with an
(optimal) linear income tax. Deaton (1979, 81) showed that with an optimal linear income tax,
weak separability between goods and leisure together with linear Engel curves for goods is a
sufficient condition for no indirect taxation. But when these restrictive conditions are not
satisfied, in general commodity taxation is required, even with an optimal linear tax (Stiglitz
(2009a), a revision and extension of Stiglitz (1976a)). 27 Gauthier and Laroque (2009) provide a
more general account of the role of separability in optimal taxation and expenditure.
Sections 2 and 3 explore some of the more general results (some, as we note, already in the
literature) in which separability suffices to ensure that commodity taxation is not needed with

A fuller analysis would address why the government is better able to spread risks than the market. Welldeveloped theories based on information asymmetries have explained imperfections in capital markets and their
ability to share risk.
26
Musgrave and Domar (1944) used mean variance analysis. Stiglitz (1969b) showed that this was true more
generally, for risk averse individuals.
27
It is worth noting, though, that the structure of optimal commodity taxation does not look like that described by
Ramsey (1927) (where tax rates were simply related to elasticities of demand and supply) or Diamond and Mirrlees
(1971). At the same time, one can still derive a simple formula, given the optimal commodity taxes, for the
optimal linear tax rate, based on an appropriately weighted average of the labor supply elasticities. The optimal
tax can be related to a measure of the marginal benefit associated with inequality reduction (this marginal
measure differs from the Atkinson measure, which identified how much individuals would be willing to pay to get
rid of all inequality. Obviously, at the margin, there is greater social cost of inequality. Stiglitz (1976a) relates this
to a societal measure of inequality aversion (or risk aversion), obtaining a remarkably simple approximation for the

income tax, but did not derive the above simple expression for the optimal tax rate. Subsequently, Piketty and Saez
(2012) extended these earlier papers to provide tax formulae based on observable sufficient statistics. )

needed.
II.

The Basic Model

We begin our discussion with the standard model, with two types of individuals,
differing in ability, but having the same utility function, reviewing the results of Stiglitz (1982a),
as a prelude to the subsequent analysis. The ith individual faces a before-tax wage (output per
hour) of 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 , and thus, in the absence of taxation, his budget constraint is simply

but the product, the ith individual’s income, 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 is. The ith individual receives utility from

consuming goods and disutility from work:

We have formulated the problem as a directly control problem on {𝑪𝑪𝒊𝒊 , 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 }, but the solution can
be implemented by a simple non-linear tax system, i.e. individual 1 is confronted with indirect

taxes giving relative prices corresponding to the LHS of (9a), a marginal income tax rate given by
the LHS of (9b), and a non-linear income tax giving the equivalent of a lump sum tax combined
with a linear income tax with marginal rate given by (9b) yielding utility level for individual 1 of
����
𝑈𝑈1 (V1*). Similarly, the high ability individual has no marginal income tax or consumption tax,
but faces a non-linear income tax giving the equivalent of a lump sum tax yielding V2*, where

{V1*, V2*} are the utility levels given by the solution to the optimal tax problem. Thus, we have
the familiar result:
Proposition 1a. There should be no distortionary taxation on the individual with the highest
ability while the labor supply of the less able is distorted.
This result goes beyond that of Mirrlees (1971) which said that the top marginal income tax rate
should be zero 32. (8a) says that there should be no commodity taxation on the high ability as
well. 33
Figure 1 provides a simple diagrammatic illustration with a single consumption good. In
Figure 1A, the two types are quite different, so different that the high ability does not want to
mimic the low ability if we impose non-distortionary taxation. Point E1* is the point on the low
With ����
𝑈𝑈1 becoming, in effect, an endogenous variable.
See also Sadka (1976), Seade (1977), and (for an overview) Tuomala (1990). Saez (2001), following Mirrlees
(1971), shows that these results are not robust to a distribution with no top income (e.g. a Pareto tail) and derives
simple asymptotic results. See also Diamond (1998). But the Pareto tail is used as a good approximation of a
description of the probability distribution of the tail. There is, in practice, an identifiable person with the top
income. Thus, we would have no problem in the United States identifying who that person is (assuming honest
reporting of income), and setting a top marginal tax rate for that individual at zero. That income will be going up
over time—as the incomes of all individuals will be changing, implying a change in the optimal structure. But there
is no reason to impose a distortionary tax on that individual simply because we could conceive of there being a
higher income individual.
33
This result does not depend on separability of the utility function.

ability indifference curve U1* which maximizes revenues, i.e. in which there is no distortionary
taxation, so the slope of the indifference curve is unity. (Government revenue is just the
difference between Y and C). Knowing R1, the revenue raised from the low ability individuals
(or, as illustrated in this figure, the subsidy provided to them) and the required government
revenue, we know the revenue that has to be raised by from the high ability individuals, and
V2* is the highest level of utility of the high ability consistent with raising that revenue, E2* the
maximal revenue raising point on the corresponding indifference curve. It is clear that the high
ability individual does not want to imitate the low ability individual. But Figure 1B shows the
more typical case, where they would. The maximal revenue consistent with U1 being equal to
����
𝑈𝑈1 requires a sufficiently high tax on the high ability that they would mimic the low risk. In the
figure, we depict the tax on the high ability that would make them indifferent between

mimicking, and we assume it does not suffice. For the self-selection constraint to be satisfied,
E1* now must entail lower levels of income and consumption (labor supply) and lower tax
revenues from the low ability, and hence a higher level of revenues raised from the high ability.
At the optimum, the high ability is just indifferent to imitating the low.

= 1, thus establishing:

Proposition 1b. There should be no commodity taxation on either high or low ability

individuals if leisure and consumption are separable.
Whether commodity j should be taxed (relative to k) depends simply on the impact of
an increase in leisure on the marginal rate of substitution between commodities j and k -- a
14

property that has nothing to do with Ramsey’s focus on deadweight loss, but tax structure is
related to the deadweight loss associated with the self-selection constraint which come into
play if government needs to raise a given revenue, cares about distribution, but is in an
environment in which governments cannot tell who is able and who is not. The self-selection
constraints that the government employs to achieve fair taxation create first order distortions.
Commodity taxation can, under certain conditions, reduce the force of those distortions.
The intuition is simple: consider a good which is complementary with leisure. If a high
ability individual tries to mimic a low-level individual, he has more leisure, and his demand for
that good will accordingly be higher. Hence, taxing that good and using the proceeds to
subsidize a good which is a substitute for leisure will make mimicking the low ability individual
less attractive. With a weakened self-selection constraint, the low ability individual can work
more, moving along his indifference curve—and in doing so generate more revenue for the
government. Thus, the utility of both individuals can be increased and still satisfy the revenue
constraint: indirect taxation is a Pareto improvement. However, if there is separability, then
the levels of consumption of the goods is identical when the high ability imitates the low ability,
and hence there is no way to use differential taxation to weaken the self-selection constraint.
There is another intuition which may prove helpful. In the case of separability, where
𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 (𝜙𝜙(𝑪𝑪𝒊𝒊 ), 𝐿𝐿𝒊𝒊 ), one can think of 𝜙𝜙 itself as an aggregate consumption good. Individuals
take their wage income and buy “𝜙𝜙”. We know from Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) that we
want production efficiency 34. Productive efficiency in producing φ implies no commodity
taxation.
Taxation of Interest Income
An immediate implication of these results is that in the case where consumption in
different periods is separable from leisure--typical of many of the simplified models explored in
the macroeconomic literature--there should be no interest income taxation.
There is no strong presumption whether in the absence of separability there should be
an interest income tax or subsidy. Consider, for instance, the standard life cycle formulation

34

Later, we will qualify this result. See also Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1971, 1972).

(dropping for the moment subscripts describing the individual, and simplifying by assuming
consumption is uni-dimensional).
(10) 𝑈𝑈 𝑡𝑡 = 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 (𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 , 𝐿𝐿𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡+1 (𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 ),

where there is time separability, but not separability between consumption and leisure and
where Ct is consumption of the individual when he is young and working and Ct+1 is
consumption in retirement. Then the marginal rate of substitution between second period
𝜕𝜕𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 /𝜕𝜕𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡

consumption and first period consumption is 𝜕𝜕𝑢𝑢

𝑡𝑡+1 /𝜕𝜕𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1

. It follows that:

Proposition 2. With the time separable utility function (10), if an increase in leisure increases
the marginal utility of consumption in the first period, i.e. if leisure and consumption are
complements, then there should be an interest income tax. Conversely, if an increase in leisure
decreases the marginal utility of consumption in the first period, i.e. if they are substitutes, then
there should be an interest income subsidy. Either is plausible and individuals may differ.
The intuition provided earlier helps understand what is going on. We want to make it
more expensive (less advantageous) for the high ability person to pretend to be the low ability
person. In doing so, he increases his leisure. Skiing is a complement to leisure, so we want to
tax skis; household help is a substitute for leisure, so we want to subsidize domestic help. High
income people who work long hours with high savings rates, in anticipation of an enjoyable
retirement, are evidencing complementarity between leisure and consumption; a subsidy on
the return to savings increases the cost of cutting back on savings (as would happen if the high
ability pretends to be a low ability). 35
Atmospheric externalities
Still another generalization that is easy to incorporate into the model is atmospheric
externalities36, i.e. there is some variable B (for Bad) which is a function of the aggregate
consumption variables. Both production and utility can be adversely affected by B:
It should be clear from the structure of the analysis that if individuals supplied labor at different dates, so Ui =
U (Ct , Ct+1 , … CT , Lt , Lt+1 , … LT ), but the utility function remained separable between consumption and leisure
(work) Ui = ui (Ct , Ct+1 , … CT ) + vi (Lt , Lt+1 , … LT ) it would remain true that no interest income tax should be
imposed, though, in general, the tax an individual would pay on wage income in one year would depend in wage
income earned in other years.
36
An atmospheric externality is an externality the value of which depends on aggregate consumption. In the
notation below C, is the vector aggregate consumption of all commodities.

where […] represents the derivative of the Lagrangian in the absence of externalities. There are
three additional terms: {A} represents the direct consumption externality; {B} represents the

In the case of a separable utility function, which can take on the form of: 37
(11a) 𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑣𝑣(𝑪𝑪, 𝐿𝐿) − 𝑍𝑍(𝐵𝐵),

the third term disappears, and there are only the direct externality effects of the kind that have
been analyzed by Pigou (1920) and Sandmo (1975). The results for (11a) are obvious: because
of the structure of preferences, the level of B can’t affect any choices made by anyone, and
therefore can’t affect the structure of taxation. However, in the case of (11a), the very
presence of self-selection constraints changes the social marginal valuation of consumption (in
effect, the shadow price on different consumption goods). The additional terms A and B
represent alterations to these shadow prices, as opposed to the market prices. Moreover, the
presence of atmospheric externalities (under 11a) does not affect choices, and so we can ignore

37

Obviously, it can also be fully separable, and the analysis does not require additive separability.

17

the indirect income effects arising from B, though obviously, not those arising from the taxation
of labor or goods.
Alternatively, separability could take the form of
(11b) 𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑣𝑣(𝐶𝐶, 𝐵𝐵) − 𝑍𝑍(𝐿𝐿).

The results for (11b) follow directly from our earlier analysis. A change in B simply shifts the
common utility function for goods.
Proposition 3A. If labor is separable from consumption then a straightforward Pigouvian
tax/subsidy is optimal. If the externality is separable from consumption and labor (but
consumption and labor are not necessarily separable), then a first-best Pigouvian tax/subsidy—
over and above the shadow prices (prices with optimal commodity taxes/subsidies)—is
desirable.
In other words, in these cases, the complicated formulae underlying the literature on
corrective taxation that focus on interactions between the corrective taxes and other taxes are
not relevant. What has been called “first best Pigouvian taxation” –where the tax is imposed to
reflect marginal harm, is desirable. (Kaplow, 2006a). On the other hand, if the utility functions
are not separable, simple Pigouvian corrective taxation is not appropriate, but the deviations
from simple Pigouvian corrective taxation do not depend (just) on indirect revenue effects, but
(also) on the impacts on self-selection constraints.
Proposition 3B. With non-separable utility functions, Pigouvian corrective taxation has to be
modified to take account not just of the second order effects on government revenue but of the
first order effects on the self-selection restraints. 38
Sandmo (1975) provided the classic modern discussion of optimal taxation in the presence of externalities, but
he conducted the analysis in the standard Ramsey-Diamond-Mirrlees framework with no income tax. The
contribution here is simply to add the self-selection constraint. Kaplow (2006a) analyzes the problem posed here,
using a very clever approach which he applies to the analysis of public goods and to the general problem of
indirect taxation discussed above (Kaplow (1996, 2006b)), which highlights the role of separability. He shows that
if there were a differential tax on commodities, there would always exist a perturbation in the tax function that
would lead to a Pareto improvement. In some respects, his result is stronger than that here, for he shows that
differential commodity taxation is not desirable regardless of whether the imposed income tax is optimal or not, so
long as it is possible to make any perturbation in the income tax function. The last observation, though, is critical.
For instance, Stiglitz (1976a, 2009a) considers differential commodity taxation in the presence of an optimal linear
income tax. There are both administrative, economic, and political reasons for a linear, or a piece-wise linear, tax
system, implying that arbitrary deviations from (quasi-) linearity may not be feasible or will entail costs not
incorporated into the analysis. Kaplow’s analysis focuses on the case of separability between consumption and
labor (11b).
38

18

In particular, if those with more leisure are more sensitive to the quality of the environment
than those with less leisure, then the (Pareto) optimal level of consumption of negative
externality generating consumption is higher, because by increasing the level of the
atmospheric externality, it enhances the ease of separation.
Public Goods
The previous subsections’ analysis can be directly applied to public goods. A public good, like a
public bad, enters everyone’s utility, and since we are assuming all individuals have the same
preferences: 𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 (𝑪𝑪𝒊𝒊 , 𝐿𝐿, 𝐺𝐺). Assume the production function is of the form ∑𝑖𝑖 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 + 𝐺𝐺 =
∑𝑖𝑖 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 , and let 𝛾𝛾 now represent the overall resource constraint. Then optimal G entails:
∑𝑖𝑖 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 𝑉𝑉𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 + 𝜆𝜆2 �𝑉𝑉𝐺𝐺2 − 𝑉𝑉�𝐺𝐺2 � = 𝛾𝛾

In the utilitarian formulation, 𝜇𝜇 i = 1, for all i. With separability (of either the form of (11a) or
(11b), with G replacing B), the sum of the marginal utilities of the public good equals the

marginal social cost, 𝛾𝛾. But 𝛾𝛾 is normally itself influenced by the self-selection constraint.

Consider first the case where neither self-selection constraint is binding (Figure 1A). Then we
𝑑𝑑V𝑖𝑖

have 𝜆𝜆2 = 0 which implies that (𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 / 𝛾𝛾) 𝑑𝑑𝐶𝐶

𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

𝑑𝑑V𝑖𝑖

= 1 or ∑𝑖𝑖(𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 𝑉𝑉𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 /𝑑𝑑𝐶𝐶 ) = 1: we obtain the
𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗

standard result that the sum of the marginal rate of substitution equals the marginal rate of
transformation, here unity. But more generally, so long as we have separability, we have
𝑑𝑑V𝑖𝑖

∑𝑖𝑖(𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 𝑉𝑉𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 / ) = 1 : Even with distortionary taxation, the Samuelson rule holds. In a sense, the
𝑑𝑑𝐶𝐶
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

result should not be too surprising. With unconstrained optimal non-linear taxation, there is no
distortion associated with the top person, and with separability, the self-selection constraint is
effectively not binding. Then there is, in effect, no marginal distortion arising from raising
additional revenue—even though taxes are, as a whole, distortionary. In the absence of

separability, the sum of the marginal rates of substitution may be either greater or less than the
marginal rate of transformation. It depends on the effect of G and of the numeraire (the
“private good”) on the self-selection constraint. In the case of separability between G and
{goods and labor}, G doesn’t affect the self-selection constraint, but the private consumption
good may either tighten the constraint (leading to lower consumption and a higher valuation of

19

the private good for the low ability individual) or loosen it.39 Note that since different public
goods may enter into preferences differently, for some goods the sum of the MRS’s may be less
than the MRT, for others greater.
III.

Extension to Many Periods with Overlapping Generations

If we are to analyze meaningfully the desirability of an interest income tax, we have to
do so within a model in which the return to capital is determined endogenously. We do so in
the standard overlapping generations model. Each generation is assumed to live for two
periods, working in the first, and consuming in both periods. Within each generation, there are
two types (the able and the less able), but the government does not know who is who. The
utility function of the ith type in the tth generation is denoted by 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 (𝑪𝑪𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊,𝒕𝒕 , 𝑪𝑪𝒊𝒊𝒕𝒕,𝒕𝒕+𝟏𝟏 , 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 )

where 𝑪𝑪𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊,𝒕𝒕 is the tth generation’s vector of consumption during the first (working) period, and

𝑪𝑪𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊,𝒕𝒕+𝟏𝟏is the tth generation’s consumption during the second (retirement) period of this life. As
before, the self-selection constraint can be written as :

𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡2 �𝑪𝑪𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐,𝒕𝒕 , 𝑪𝑪𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐,𝒕𝒕+𝟏𝟏 , 𝐿𝐿2,𝑡𝑡 � ≥ 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡2 �𝑪𝑪𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏,𝒕𝒕 , 𝑪𝑪𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏,𝒕𝒕+𝟏𝟏 , 𝐿𝐿�2,𝑡𝑡 �.

Output at the time t is given by a neo-classical production function of the form
Qt = F (K t , Et ), where Et = v N1 L1,t + N2 L2,t is the effective labor supply. If there are no

constraints on the government’s ability to use social security or debt policy to control the

capital stock (see Atkinson and Stiglitz [1980]) then the only macro-constraint that needs to be
taken into account are the period resource constraints, which we write as
(14)

𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡 = 𝐾𝐾𝑡𝑡+1 + ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 + ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1,𝑡𝑡 + 𝐺𝐺 = 𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 (𝐾𝐾𝑡𝑡 , 𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡 )

where we have assumed that capital wears out each period. Forming the Lagrangian as
before 40 , but with separate constraints for each period (including for the self-selection
Boadway and Keen (1993) provider a fuller analysis of the optimal provision of public goods. Note that the
question of whether the sum of the MRS’s is greater or less than the marginal rate of transformation does not
translate directly into whether the supply of public goods with distortionary taxation is less than or greater than
with lump sum taxation, since this is a matter of general equilibrium, in which all the variables are endogenous.
See Atkinson and Stern (1974) for a discussion of the matter in the context of the Ramsey-Diamond-Mirrlees
model.

Proposition 4a. In the overlapping generations model with two types of labor at every t, there
should be no interest income tax on the savings of the high ability individuals, a zero marginal
income tax, and no commodity taxation; while, as in the static model, low ability individuals
face distortionary taxation on labor, commodities, and savings. With separability between
leisure and consumption, there should be no commodity or interest taxation on the low ability.
Without separability, there should be commodity and interest income taxes (or subsidies.)
Rather than focusing on Pareto optimality, we could have maximized intertemporal
social welfare, say using a utilitarian social welfare function: max ∑𝑡𝑡 𝛿𝛿 𝑡𝑡 (𝑁𝑁1 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡1 + 𝑁𝑁2 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡2 ),

where the welfare of future generations are discounted at the rate δ (δ is the pure rate of social
time preference). In steady state

𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡

𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡+1

= 𝐹𝐹𝐾𝐾 (𝐾𝐾 ∗ , 𝐸𝐸 ∗ ) = 𝑟𝑟 ∗ = 1/𝛿𝛿 . (15) and (16) then imply

that the economy with distortionary taxation converges to the modified golden rule, where the
rate of return equals the pure rate of social time preference. With separabilty, both individuals’
MRS is equal to that rate, but in general, the low ability individual’s may not be.
Proposition 4b. In the steady state of the overlapping generations utilitarian optimal tax
problem, with, and, in general, only with separability, the rate of interest (both the producer
and consumer rate of interest, for both the low and high ability individuals) equals the pure rate
of social time preference.

Public and Private Investment
It is easy to extend the analysis to incorporate public as well as private investment. Let
𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 represent public investment, 𝐾𝐾𝑝𝑝 private investment, and let the production function now
be 𝑄𝑄 = 𝐶𝐶 + 𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 + 𝐾𝐾𝑝𝑝 = 𝐹𝐹(𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 , 𝐾𝐾𝑝𝑝 , 𝐸𝐸), where C is aggregate consumption . It immediately
follows that 𝐹𝐹𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 = 𝐹𝐹𝐾𝐾𝑝𝑝 .

Proposition 4c. Pareto efficient taxation-cum-expenditures requires that the return on public
capital equal the return on private capital, which asymptotically, is just equal to the pure rate of
time preference.
These results are clearly parallel to those of Diamond and Mirrlees (1971), who argued
for production efficiency.

22

IV. Distributive effects of tax and expenditure policy
The analysis so far has established that the results derived earlier, both with respect to
taxation and public production, in simple partial equilibrium models hold more generally in a
dynamic, overlapping generations, general equilibrium model; it has shown that Ramsey’s
analysis provides little guidance either for the design of efficient or redistributive commodity
taxation; it has confirmed that the Diamond-Mirrlees result on the desirability of efficiency
holds in this setting; and it has shown that the analysis can be extended to incorporate
externalities, with modifications from Pigouvian corrective taxation based not on Ramsey-like
indirect impacts on tax revenues but on impacts on self-selection constraints.
Unfortunately, several of these results are not robust, if government tax or expenditure
policies can affect the distribution of income in ways which cannot be directly offset by tax
policy: in our model, relative wages, 𝑣𝑣. If the two types of labor are not perfect substitutes,
then in general 𝑣𝑣 will be affected by levels of consumption of each of the goods and labor

supply of the two types of labor. Optimal tax theory is predicated on the inability to observe
either output per hour or the number of hours worked, because if one could do so, one could
infer ability, and thus impose lump sum taxation.41 Thus, dropping the time subscripts
(focusing on the basic model of section II), the first order condition for 𝐶𝐶2𝑗𝑗 is:

Proposition 5. If relative wages are affected by consumption levels of different commodities by
the high skilled, then there should be indirect taxation on the high skilled; if relative wages are
affected by levels of different commodities by the low skilled, then there should be indirect
taxation on the low skilled even with separability between consumption and labor; if labor
supply by high skilled individuals affects relative wages, then high wage individuals should face
a marginal income tax (or subsidy). Any change in 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 or 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 that improves the distribution of

besides ability, e.g. effort or education. We cannot pursue these ideas here.
41

23

income (i.e. increases the low ability individual’s wage relative to that of the high ability)
improves welfare, and hence taxes should be designed to reflect this.
This means that the consumption of unskilled labor-intensive goods should be
encouraged (their consumption prices reduced). In particular, we know from Samuelson’s
(1948) analysis of the two-factor two good international trade model, where output in each
sector is a function of skilled and unskilled labor, that a movement along the production
possibilities schedule (with fixed inputs of skilled and unskilled labor) towards the production of
the unskilled-intensive good leads to an increase in relative wages of unskilled workers. The
implications for labor supply (taxation of labor income) are, in this model where there are no
other factors of production, disquieting (Stiglitz, 1982b). Since in such a model, the two types
of labor have to be complements (F12 > 0), an increase in skilled labor has to increase the
relative wage of the unskilled. This means that we have to encourage more labor supply by the
skilled (from what it would be in the absence of an effect on relative wages), i.e. the top
marginal tax rate should be negative. This result, however, is not general: if we have a three
factor production function (output is a function of the two types of labor and land), then skilled
and unskilled labor can be substitutes, in which case the top marginal tax rate should be
positive, in contrast to the standard result in optimal (income) taxation, that it should be zero.
(See Mirrlees (1971) and Saez (2001).)
Similarly, the optimal Pigouvian tax formulae for correction of externalities and the
formulae for the optimal supply of public goods have to be corrected for induced wage effects:
the externality or public good may have an effect on relative wages, and thus on the selfselection constraints. The required modifications in the optimal formulae are straightforward.
Note, in particular, that the simplifying results that hold with separability (that the effects on
self-selection constraints can be ignored) no longer hold.
Production efficiency
Soon after Diamond and Mirrlees established their efficiency result—that optimal
commodity taxation should ensure production efficiency—Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1971, 1972)
showed that this would not be so in general, in particular if there were restricted taxation, for
instance if there were rents (pure profits) that could not be taxed at 100%, or if there were
24

some factors or goods that had to be taxed at the same rate. A direct implication of the
Diamond Mirrlees efficiency result was that it was not optimal to impose tariffs.
Correspondingly, an implication of the Dasgupta-Stiglitz results was that it often was desirable
to impose tariffs. (Dasgupta and Stiglitz, 1975.) Not surprisingly, the same result holds in the
current context. Here, the critical issue is distribution. In the previous paragraphs, we assumed
that government could not directly control 𝑣𝑣 by the imposition of (optimal) indirect taxes on
the labor supply of skilled and unskilled labor—an assumption we noted that was fully

consistent with the standard optimal tax model, where only the product of hours worked and
wages per hour is observable. But even if the wages received by or paid to any individual is
not observable to the government, the government can affect the relative wage paid to
unskilled workers.
Thus, if the government imposes a tariff on the relative price of the unskilled labor
intensive good, it increases 𝑣𝑣, relaxing the self-selection constraint.42 The benefit of relaxing

that constraint has to be compared with the cost of the resulting inefficiency, which is captured
by the impact on the resource constraint of an increase in p, the domestic producer price, over
the international price, which we assume is unity. With international trade 43, the resource
constraint can be written ∑𝑗𝑗 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 (𝑝𝑝; 𝐿𝐿1 , 𝐿𝐿2 ) = ∑𝑖𝑖 ∑𝑗𝑗 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , where 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 is the output of the jth

commodity, a function of relative prices and the aggregate supplies of the two types of labor.
Specifying {L1, L2} determines the production possibilities curve. Specifying p determines where
on the production possibilities curve the economy operates. In Figure 2, AB measures the
inefficiency at the equilibrium of aggregate consumption of one good in terms of the other
good: how much more aggregate consumption could have been had a tariff not been imposed.
We impose a tariff on the unskilled labor intensive good, which increases unskilled relative
wages. The optimal tariff satisfies the first order condition 44:

[FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE]
There are similarly many ways within the closed economy to show the (potential)
desirability of distortionary production taxation in a world where we cannot tax separately
skilled and unskilled work. For instance, assume we have two sectors in the economy, each
producing all the goods (a dual economy), one of which is more unskilled labor intensive. For
each we have a transformation function 𝔍𝔍𝑘𝑘 �𝑪𝑪𝒌𝒌𝟏𝟏 , 𝑪𝑪𝒌𝒌𝟐𝟐 , 𝐺𝐺 𝑘𝑘 , 𝐿𝐿𝑘𝑘1 , 𝐿𝐿𝑘𝑘2 � = 0, where the jth element of

𝑘𝑘
𝑘𝑘
Ck1 is output of consumption good j in the kth sector, so 𝐶𝐶1𝑗𝑗
+ 𝐶𝐶2𝑗𝑗
= total production of

commodity j in the kth sector, which in equilibrium must be equal to the total consumption of
that product. We can tax differently the consumption of good j depending on the producer.
Doing so is equivalent to imposing a producer tax. In our direct control problem, where we
specify the level of consumption of each good by each type of individual, we now specify the
level of consumption of each good by sector. Since what we are concerned about is relative
wages, what matters is aggregate consumption across the two individuals of output from the
two sectors, which can variously be thought of as the advanced or large corporate sector, and
the informal or SME sector. In equilibrium, there are additional constraints imposed by the fact
that while the government cannot observe wages, individuals do, and they allocate themselves
so that the wages in the two sectors for each type of labor are the same. (A more realistic
model would incorporate labor market frictions.) The Lagrangian now needs to be rewritten,
with additional terms representing resource constraints 𝛾𝛾𝑘𝑘 [𝔍𝔍𝑘𝑘 - 0 ] 45; and the free labor

mobility constraint, ensuring equal marginal products of labor in the two sectors relative to say
the numeraire, 0: ζ𝑖𝑖 [ 𝔍𝔍a𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 / 𝔍𝔍𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜 − 𝔍𝔍u𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 / 𝔍𝔍𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜 ], where the superscript a stands for the advanced

sector, and u for the less advanced sector, and 𝔍𝔍k𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 / 𝔍𝔍𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜 is the wage in the kth sector of type i

labor in terms of the numeraire, denoted “o”. The optimization equation (the derivative of the
Lagrangian) for 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘 now contains an extra set of terms, one focusing on the effect of the

With an increase in production a of say good j in the advanced and SME sectors having different
effects on the demand for unskilled labor, and thus affecting the value of ν and thus the selfselection constraint, there is a strong presumption against production efficiency. 46
Proposition 6. In general, production efficiency is not desirable. If there are two (or more)
sectors of the economy with different production functions, and in particular, different
responses of relative demands for different types of labor (and thus relative wages) to demands
for different goods, then production efficiency is not desirable. In particular, distortionary tariffs
are in general desirable.
Distortionary production tax in effect reduces the burden imposed on distortionary
consumption taxes. The freedom that Diamond and Mirrlees had in setting taxes on skilled and
unskilled labor—different factors of production that to them were observable—meant that
these distributive effects could always be “undone” by changes in factor taxation. The
assumption here is that this is not possible: if we could observe the type of labor (skilled or
unskilled), we could observe who was providing that type of labor, and thus infer directly the
type of the individual, and thus impose lump sum taxation. 47
Extending the life cycle model
In this sub-section, we extend the analysis of the previous sections to include distributive
effects of taxation within a life cycle model. As before, we assume that the two types of labor
are not perfect substitutes, i.e., the aggregate production is of the form 𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡 = 𝐹𝐹(𝐾𝐾𝑡𝑡 , 𝐿𝐿1𝑡𝑡 , 𝐿𝐿2𝑡𝑡 )

with 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = 𝐹𝐹𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 , where 𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡 = 𝐾𝐾𝑡𝑡+1 + ∑𝑖𝑖 ∑𝑗𝑗 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . Now, relative wages depend on investment.

Production efficiency requires that the marginal rate of transformation of all goods that are produced in both
sectors be the same in the two sectors, i.e. 𝔍𝔍 aj / 𝔍𝔍 am = 𝔍𝔍 uj / 𝔍𝔍 um, where j and m are any two goods.
47
It is thus conceivable that the government observe the type of labor input, but no the “name” of the individual
providing that type of labor. Especially in the unincorporated sector, our assumption is more plausible; and so long
as there are some sectors of the economy where the type of labor being provided is unobservable, our results on
the desirability of distortionary production taxation hold.

where 𝐶𝐶2𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is the high ability individual of generation t’s consumption of commodity j in time t,
𝐶𝐶2𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡+1 is that at time t + 1. A similar calculation applies to type 1 individuals. So too, consider

two types of capital goods, say Kg and Kp using the same amount of resources to construct, Qt =
Kgt+1 + Kpt+1 + ΣΣCijt, so production efficiency requires FKgt = FKpt, the marginal returns to these
two types of capital should be the same. It thus immediately follows that:
Proposition 7a: If the level of capital affects relative wages, the marginal rate of substitution is
in general not equal to the marginal rate of transformation even for the high ability individual;
even in the presence of separability, it may be optimal to have an interest income tax or subsidy
on both high and low ability individuals. Production efficiency is not desirable if different kinds
of capital affect the distribution of income differently.
Increases in capital (and in different types of capital goods) change wage inequality. We
impose a tax on interest income if an increase in K increases wage inequality, i.e. if capital (like
robots) lowers unskilled wage relative to skilled wages. 48 The reason we do so is related to how
the self-selection constraints are affected. More generally, whether there should be a tax or
Hicks (1932) defined an innovation as labor saving if at the given levels of inputs the marginal return to labor is
reduced. Labor saving innovations lead to a reduction in wages. The vocabulary extends directly to the context
here: an increase in capital is unskilled labor saving if at the given levels of inputs, the marginal return to unskilled
labor decreases. We are particularly concerned here how a change in K affects relative wages, ν.

48

28

subsidy on capital depends on whether an increase in the capital stock increases or decreases
relative wages, i.e., makes the self-selection constraint more or less binding. 49
If we can differentiate among different kinds of capital, i.e. K is a vector, with some
components labor saving or using for different kinds of labor, then there should be a tax on
those kinds of capital goods which are unskilled labor saving and a subsidy on those which are
unskilled labor using. The returns on different kinds of capital goods should, accordingly, differ.
There is no reason that the effect on inequality of public and private capital goods will be the
same. In general, government can have more control (directly) in the choice of the extent to
which public capital goods are complementary to unskilled labor (i.e. increase 𝑣𝑣) then public
capital goods should be advantaged over private capital goods; the marginal return (“FK”) to

public investment goods should be less than that for private capital goods, and in a utilitarian
dynamic optimal growth model, in steady state, FKg may thus be less than 1/ δ.
More generally, the economy’s transformation curve can be written as before as
𝔍𝔍𝐿𝐿

𝔍𝔍(𝑪𝑪𝟏𝟏 , 𝑪𝑪𝟐𝟐 , 𝐿𝐿1 , 𝐿𝐿2 , 𝑲𝑲𝒕𝒕+𝟏𝟏 , 𝑲𝑲𝒕𝒕 ) = 0, with 𝑣𝑣 = 𝔍𝔍 2 .

(18)

𝐿𝐿1

(18) describes an economy in which different consumption or capital goods are produced with
different production functions. A movement along the transformation curve changes the
relative demand for high and low skilled workers, i.e. affects relative wages. Now, in general,
even the basic formulae for consumption tax (15), which we have shown hold in the more
general overlapping generations model, have to be changed; it follows that
Proposition 7b: If relative wages depend on consumption or public expenditure patterns, then in
general, even with separability (i) the rate of return should not equal the intertemporal marginal
rate of substitution, (ii) the rate of return in the public sector should not equal that in the
private one, and (iii) even asymptotically, with utilitarian intertemporal optimization, it will not
equal the pure rate of time preference. 50
Consumption at date t affects the self-selection constraint at date t, while consumption
at date t+1 of the same commodity affects the self-selection constraint at t+1. But individuals

consume different commodity bundles; if the elderly on average consume more unskilled laborintensive services (e.g. home care), then we want to encourage individuals to consume more
later in life, because that drives up the relative wages of unskilled workers, reducing before tax
inequality and the extent to which the self-selection constraint binds, i.e. we would want to
subsidize high income individual’s savings. Conversely, if the elderly on average consume more
skill-labor intensive goods and services, like complex medical procedures. (As we explain in the
next section, we do not believe that this model captures accurately the most important aspects
of capital taxation.)
Thus, in the utilitarian dynamic optimization problem, even with separability, the
consumer rate of discount (for neither high nor low ability individuals) may not converges to δ,
and the producer rate of return is greater or less than δ as increasing K decreases or increases
𝑣𝑣, the relative wage. If an increase in capital accumulation increases the wage differential (if

capital is a complement to high skill labor and a substitute for low skilled workers) the optimal
level of 𝐹𝐹𝑘𝑘 (assuming separability in consumption) is higher than the pure discount rate, i.e. the

optimal level of capital accumulation is lower.

Distortions in the overlapping generations model with unskilled labor replacing robots
We have already seen that the level of investment in different kinds of investment
goods, whether in the private or public sector, depends in part on the impact of that good (at
the margin) on the distribution of income. Recently, there has been some controversy over the
taxation of robots. 51 Assume we have robots which are perfect substitutes for unskilled labor.
Consider robots (a particular type of machine), each costing one unit of ordinary capital
goods, replacing unskilled labor. Our production function is now 𝑄𝑄 = 𝐹𝐹(𝐿𝐿1 + 𝑅𝑅, 𝐿𝐿2 , 𝐾𝐾 − 𝑅𝑅).

Production efficiency requires 𝐹𝐹𝐿𝐿1 = 𝐹𝐹𝐾𝐾 . But maximizing social welfare entails:

Bill Gates suggested that there should be such a tax (Delaney, 2017). There was the predictable backlash among
those who thought that that was foolish, since it would interfere with efficiency and impede innovation. This
paper explains why the former charge has no validity. The second might. If there is learning by doing with spillovers to other sector, there is a presumption that the government should be subsidizing robot development. (See
Stiglitz and Greenwald, 2014), and tax or subsidy discussed here should be viewed as an increase or decrease in
that tax.

there should be further investments in unskilled labor replacing robots if it increases ν; and if it
decreases ν, the level of investment in robots should be decreased (there should be a tax on
that kind of robot.) Thus, so long as the direct effect of “competition” from robots driving down
wages (F11 < 0) dominates any secondary effects from the decrease in K on wages of high skilled
workers, it is desirable to tax unskilled labor replacing robots. It is easy to see that that is the

Central message

The central message of this section of the paper is simple: tax and expenditure policies
can have effects on the distribution of income that cannot be fully offset by other tax and
subsidy policies. Measures which improve the market distribution of income (here increase ν)
are desirable. Heuristically, we can think of such measures as reducing the burden imposed on
distortionary consumption taxation. This result provides theoretical underpinnings for recent
policy perspectives, noted in the introduction, which have emphasized the importance of
achieving greater equality of market incomes. Thus, tax and expenditure policies need to be
sensitive to the general equilibrium distributional consequences. A tax which has the effect of
reducing the demand for unskilled labor should be reduced from the level which it otherwise
would have been; conversely if it increases the demand for skilled labor. Public investments
should be targeted to increase the productivity of unskilled workers. Private expenditures
aimed at replacing unskilled labor with machines should be discouraged (through taxation.)
The mechanism by which the welfare benefits are generated in this model is not just the
direct effect on, say unskilled workers. In the context of a government already engaged in
welfare maximizing redistributions with lump sum taxes, all that would matter is what happens
to aggregate output. But such taxes and redistributions are not feasible. Hence, changes in
relative wages also matter because they may affect the constraints on redistribution. Here, the
central constraint is the self-selection constraint. In our model, an “improvement” in the
distribution of income through an increase in the relative wage of unskilled workers loosens the

self-selection constraint and thus enables the government to engage in further redistributions
which improve societal welfare. Our analysis formalizes the notion that improving the before
tax distribution of income makes it easier to get a better after tax distribution of income.
More generally, there are a broad set of hard-to-model political constraints. It is
apparent that tax policy does not quickly (if at all) act to offset changes in the market
distribution of income. Thus, an improvement in the before tax distribution of income will
typically lead to an improvement in the after tax distribution of income and in societal welfare.
Perhaps the most striking result is that these concerns over distribution are so strong
that they justify policies that lead to production inefficiency. In Diamond-Mirrlees, any
distributive benefits achieved through production inefficiency could be achieved at lower cost
simply by adjusting tax rates. But if there are restraints on the set of feasible taxes that go
beyond just limitations on lump sum taxes, then government cannot necessarily achieve the
general equilibrium effects on distribution that are obtained through distortionary production
taxes (including tariffs).
V. Layered self-selection
There is one more important set of circumstances requiring significant modification of
the Atkinson-Stiglitz (1976) framework. The standard Mirrlees model, of which our analysis can
be viewed as an elaboration, is based on self-employed individuals producing widgets. The
government can only observe the number of widgets produced, not the hours worked, and
therefore it cannot infer abilities. But in fact, in modern economies, most individuals work for
others, and their employers also need to identify abilities. Individuals too will seek to
demonstrate to their employers that they are more able, so as to obtain higher wages. 54 While
screening and signaling may be done in a number of ways, the government may be able to
partially free ride on this information; and in any case, government has to take into account
that tax policies affect screening and signaling.
Consider the simplest case where an employer cannot observe either an individual’s
output, Y, or his ability but can observe his level of education. But Y itself is a function of

with education E, with a low ability individual’s indifference curve in {E,w} space being steeper:
he requires a greater increase in wages to compensate him for getting more education. The
standard competitive equilibrium entails a separating equilibrium, with {𝐸𝐸1∗ , 𝑤𝑤1∗ } being the point
on the low ability production function (or more precisely, 𝑤𝑤1 = 𝑓𝑓1 (𝐸𝐸1 )) which maximizes 𝑉𝑉 1 .

{𝐸𝐸2∗ , 𝑤𝑤2∗ } is the point along the high ability’s productivity curve 𝑤𝑤2 = 𝑓𝑓2 (𝐸𝐸2 )) satisfying the self-

selection constraint: V1{𝐸𝐸1∗ , 𝑤𝑤1∗ } ≥ V1{𝐸𝐸2∗ , 𝑤𝑤2∗ }. If w is observable to the government, even if E is

not, the government knows the ability of the individual. It effectively free rides off of the

private sector. By imposing effectively a lump sum tax on high wage individuals used to pay a
lump sum subsidy to low wage individuals, the government can achieve another Pareto
efficient self-selection equilibrium, one more in accord with its social welfare function.55 In this
case, optimal income taxation is far simpler than that modelled by Mirrlees.
But there is a more difficult case, where there are binding self-selection constraints
where the outcomes of the private self-selection processes are not observable. Consider, in
particular, the above education model, but where education affects individual’s productivity.
Firm’s observe this, and pay a wage accordingly; but, as in Mirrlees, the government cannot
observe the wage (output per hour) or education level. In the absence of taxation, individual’s
utility can be written as a function of their wage (= productivity) and E: 𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 (𝑤𝑤, 𝐸𝐸), where
now individuals can choose how much to work. We now need to embed the private self-

selection constraint inside our social welfare maximization problem, adding a term to our
Lagrangian 𝜁𝜁 [𝑉𝑉1 (𝑪𝑪1 , 𝐿𝐿1 , 𝐸𝐸1 ) – 𝑉𝑉1 (𝑪𝑪2 , 𝐿𝐿2 , 𝐸𝐸2 )], where we have reverted to our usual notation

where 1 is the low ability individual and 2 is the high ability. More specifically, we assume that
education level E requires a vector of consumption 𝑪𝑪𝒊𝒊 (𝐸𝐸) and time 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 (𝐸𝐸) which yield no direct
utility, leaving 𝑪𝑪 − 𝑪𝑪𝒊𝒊 (𝐸𝐸) and 𝐿𝐿 − 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 (𝐸𝐸) for “real” consumption and leisure. While E is

observable, and the functions 𝑪𝑪𝒊𝒊 (𝐸𝐸) and 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 (𝐸𝐸) are known, the type of the individual is not, so

that if one type mimics another, the government can only infer the effects, e.g. on the marginal
rates of substitutions. The resource constraint also needs to be rewritten to include the costs
55

The taxes will, of course, affect equilibrium wages and education levels, because of income effects.

and benefits of education 56: 𝐶𝐶1 + 𝐶𝐶2 + 𝐸𝐸1 + 𝐸𝐸2 = 𝐹𝐹(𝐿𝐿1 𝑓𝑓(𝐸𝐸1 ) + 𝐿𝐿2 𝑓𝑓(𝐸𝐸2 )). Note that
while the binding self-selection in the usual optimal tax problem entails the high ability
pretending to be low ability—working less and getting a lower income—in the usual
competitive market equilibrium, the binding self-selection constraint entails the low ability
pretending to be high ability. Thus, as he increases his education level (to imitate the high
ability) and so gets a high wage (w2), he also may be required to work more. It is this which
upsets the standard results of optimal tax theory.

In this formulation, E and C occur simultaneously. A more natural formulation (especially in our dynamic model)
is that there are three periods in an individual’s life, in the first of which he gets educated, in the second of which
he works, and in the third of which he is retired. None of the results are dependent on this formulation.
Moreover, this formulation assumes that skilled and unskilled labor are perfect substitutes. The more general
case is considered in section 4.
57
In general, there are several self-selection constraints, all of which could be binding: (a) the low ability individual
is indifferent between mimicking the high ability in the eyes of the firm; (b) the high ability individual who has
obtained a high level of education is indifferent between mimicking the low ability individual who has obtained a
low level of education in the eyes of the government; and (c) the low ability individual who has mimicked a high
ability individual in obtaining a high level of education (and thus has become more productive) is indifferent
between mimicking a low ability individual who has not obtained a high level of education. But in this model, if a
high ability individual is indifferent between mimicking a low ability individual in the eyes of the government, then
a low ability individual would not want to simultaneously pretend before his employer to be high ability (and thus
get a high level of education) and pretend before the government to be low ability, for in doing so, he reduces the
value of education, since in imitating the low ability, he must restrict the number of hours worked. Thus, here we
can focus simply on the single additional self-selection constraint. Whether we have to include a still further selfselection constraint, the more general point that the addition of the new self-selection constraint means that only
when certain separability conditions are satisfied will it be desirable not to impose distortionary taxation on the
high ability individual, remains valid.

so that in general, the MRS is not equal to the MRT: there should be intervention even in the
labor market of high ability individuals. By the same token the marginal rate of substitution
𝛾𝛾+ 𝜁𝜁𝑉𝑉C1

between two commodities j and k is given by 𝛾𝛾+ 𝜁𝜁𝑉𝑉 12𝑗𝑗 which equals unity only if 𝜁𝜁𝑉𝑉C12𝑗𝑗 = 𝜁𝜁𝑉𝑉C12𝑘𝑘 ,
C2𝑘𝑘

which is true if 𝜁𝜁 = 0 or if 𝑉𝑉C12𝑗𝑗 = 𝑉𝑉C12𝑘𝑘 . As earlier, we can write :
MRS2 - MRS1 = γ (MRT – MRS1).

Thus, if the low ability is mimicking the high ability in the acquisition of education, he is
spending more on, say, tutoring services and more time doing homework, leaving less income
and less leisure. If, somehow, the result is that the marginal rate of substitution between good
j and k is the same, that would mean that MRT = MRS1 = MRS2 = 1, i.e. there should be no
consumption taxes; in the case of consumption at different dates, no interest income tax. But
education takes away from “net” consumption and leisure when the individual is young, and
thus inevitably changes the MRS between consumption at t and t + 1: it will differ between
high ability and low ability individuals. Taxing interest income—making the future less valuable
at the margin relative to today—discourages low ability individuals from imitating high ability,
loosening the private self-selection constraint, and thus increasing welfare.
The general point is that tax structures affect private mechanisms for sorting individuals,
and government needs to take into account these impacts. Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986) and
Arnott, Greenwald, and Stiglitz (1994) established that, in general, whenever there are selfselection constraints, the competitive equilibrium is not (constrained) Pareto efficient. The
distortions are first order. Small taxes have a second order deadweight loss associated with
them, but can have a first order effect in correcting distortions associated with self-selection
constraints, e.g. in improving the efficiency of market sorting. Thus, we can think of optimal
taxation as entailing two parts: (a) corrective taxation, to ensure that the market is Pareto
efficient; (b) redistributive taxation, to move us towards a “better” Pareto efficient allocation.
Not surprisingly, when both of these are taken into account, the presumption of AS 76 that
there should not be intertemporal taxation no longer holds.

35

VI. Inheritances
The most critical assumption underlying Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) was that all individuals
were identical except for their abilities. But there are huge differences in inherited wealth and
huge differences in returns to capital of those with wealth. 58 Much of the argument for capital
taxation is that taxation of capital and returns to capital can achieve greater equity at a lower
cost (say in terms of the deadweight losses associated with the tax) than just reliance on an
earned income tax. In section 2, we commented on the taxation of capital in the context of a
world in which individuals differ in their ability to generate returns on capital. Here, we focus
on inheritances.
It is easy (in principle) to separate the taxation of inheritances and the return on
inheritances from the life cycle savings discussed in previous sections. The latter can be
thought of as put into Income Retirement Accounts (IRA’s), and the analysis of earlier sections
argued that in the absence of e.g. distributive effects and with separability, there should be no
taxation of returns in IRA’s. But that says nothing about the taxation of capital in general,
which we will argue should be taxed, and possibly at a high rate. If some inherited savings slips
into IRA’s and not all life cycle savings is included in tax-exempt IRA’s, there would be some
presumption for taxing the return to capital in IRA’s, but still taxing the return to capital not in
IRA’s.
An analysis of optimal/Pareto efficient taxation of inheritances entails two complications,
beyond the general equilibrium distributive effects upon which section 4. focused. (a) A full
analysis of taxation and inequality in the presence of bequests has to come to terms with the
drivers of financial and human capital bequests—the determinants of the intergenerational
transmission of advantage and disadvantage.59 (b) It is not obvious what the appropriate social
welfare function should be.
Determinants of inheritances and the intergenerational transmission of advantages

In a world without uncertainty in returns, the taxation of capital and the return to capital are equivalent, but this
is not so in general.
59
See Stiglitz (1966, 1969a, and, most related to the discussion here, 2015 and 2017) and Becker and Tomes (1979,
1986) for a more extensive discussion.

Individual’s life time income (wealth) is determined by their endowments--inherited
ability, education provided by their parents and the State, and inherited financial wealth—and
the returns on those endowments, itself a function of those endowments, effort and luck.
Thus, there are three sources of high levels of lifetime wealth: children who have the good
fortune of having parents who bequeath them good endowments, either high abilities or
substantial amounts of financial and human capital; high levels of effort; and those who get
high earnings on their endowments, often as a result of luck. The latter include the inventors
and entrepreneurs who earn outsized incomes, often through the exploitation of market
power. Gates and Rockefeller are examples. The “successful” also include individuals who
were particularly effective in receiving favors from the state, e.g. in the form of land grants. In
many cases, wealth begets wealth through a variety of mechanisms, including the exercise of
market and political power and returns to information asymmetries.
While some of the determinants are under the control of the individual, others are not:
most importantly, inherited ability. (Some important aspects of the transmission process,
besides taxation, are matters of public policy, most importantly, education.) This implies that
any model of equilibrium wealth distribution must entail at least two (linked) stochastic
difference or differential equations—one for ability and one for (financial and human) capital
(Stiglitz, 1966, 2015; Bevan 1974, 1979; Bevan and Stiglitz, 1979). While some receive a high
inheritance because of the luck of having parents with a high “taste” for bequests, others
because of the luck of having very rich parents, others because they have fewer siblings among
whom the wealth of the parents have to be divided, there is still a fourth source of differences
in inherited wealth (more important among “life cycle savers”): in the absence of good
annuities and reverse mortgages, upper individuals who do not wish to turn to the government
for support in their final years have to hold more than what they actuarially need to live; on
average, they die before eating up all of their savings. The children of those who die early may
receive a small fortune, especially if there are no siblings. 60 While it is natural that economists
begin with a discussion of choices and tastes (some individuals or dynasties might give greater

This theory supports a Pareto tail distribution. See Stiglitz (1978). Flemming (1979) and Kupczuk and Lupton
(2007) show the empirical importance of such bequests.
60

weight to their descendants than others), 61 almost surely, these other factors are as or more
important.
In most of these cases there is little reason to believe that, in general, taxing transfers at
the top at a high marginal rate would have significant adverse effects on economic activity. For
instance, the amount of money that individuals hold for their old age as a result of the absence
of annuity markets is likely determined largely by the individual’s risk aversion, the extent of
public support for the aged and expectations of support from one’s children, and uncertainties
about life expectancy. Fertility decisions are similarly unlikely to be significantly affected by
inheritance taxation. The efforts of those like Gates and Rockefeller (either at innovative and
entrepreneurial activities or at exerting market power) are unlikely to be affected much by high
inheritance or capital taxation at levels of wealth and income exceeding some billions of dollars.
Indeed, there is some positive evidence and theory that high marginal tax rates might reduce
incentives for rent seeking and exploitation, thereby increasing economic efficiency. 62
Thus, there is some presumption that there should be high tax rates on very large bequests,
the main concern being not that individuals won’t work as hard, but that they would engage
more in tax avoidance activities (in the extreme cases, changing residence to avoid taxation). 63
Concern about inherited wealth inequality would center progressive taxation on inheritances,
not bequests.
Whatever the reason, in practice, in most countries there is still substantial
intergenerational transfer of wealth, implying that even with bequests taxes, there will be
individuals with substantial incomes from inherited capital. Thus, (progressive) taxation on
capital arises naturally within any utilitarian framework. It can be viewed as an indirect (and
imperfect) way of taxing bequests, as a second-best response to an important source of
inequality.64
See, for instance Piketty and Saez (2013).
See Saez, Piketty, and Stantcheva (2014) and Stiglitz (2017).
63
To the extent that individuals are engaged in intertemporal income smoothing with their children, inheritances
lead to less variability in consumption. But taxing inheritances and using the proceeds for investments in human
capital and redistributive transfers can more than offset both these and other adverse general equilibrium effects.
See Stiglitz (1978), Bevan and Stiglitz (1979) and the discussion below.
64
See Cremer and Pestieau (2006) and Cremer, Pesteiau and Rochet (2003), Farhi and Werning (2010), Piketty and
Saez (2013), and Stiglitz (2017).

Objectives
While Pareto efficiency and utilitarianism provide a natural framework for evaluating
alternative taxes on wages, the welfare evaluation of inheritance taxes is more complicated. As
Stiglitz (1987) noted, bequests are doubly blessed: while they give utility to the giver, they also
give utility to the receiver. There is a positive consumption externality. There is thus a
presumption that there will be an undersupply of bequests, all else being equal, and that they
should be subsidized.65 In the context of models such as those considered in previous sections,
apart from this externality effect—and possible general equilibrium distributive effects of the
kind discussed in the previous section-- bequests are just another form of utility generating
expenditure, and thus there should be no bequest taxation if (and only if) if there is separability
between consumption (now including bequests) and labor. (Kaplow 2001). 66
Trade-offs between consumption inequality and wealth inequality
But there are two reasons for thinking that this analysis does not fully capture societal
concerns about inequality. First, note that there may be a trade-off: the imposition of
inheritance taxes, in the absence of offsetting taxes, may increase consumption inequalities, in
a world in which bequests serve to smooth consumption within a dynasty, i.e. where rich
parents share some of their wealth with their children. (Stiglitz, 1976b) Consider a model (such
as Bevan and Stiglitz, 1979) where individuals themselves think about their children and, when
they have good luck, either being born with high ability or getting an unusually large return on
their investments, set aside an optimal amount to share with their descendants. Ignoring
general equilibrium effects (impacts on the distribution of income and self-selection
constraints), each individual is optimally smoothing income over generations. It might seem
that so long as the family’s intertemporal discount rate is the same as the social welfare

This idea has been incorporated into and commented upon by many of the more recent models of inheritance
taxation. See, e.g. Kaplow (2001) and Piketty and Saez (2013). At the same time there is another important
externality, that associated with an increase in inequality. There is a large literature emphasizing how inequality
affects economic performance and society more generally. Most of the economics literature on bequests has not
incorporated these important externalities.
66
Much of the literature models the utility of bequests in a reduced form, rather than as a result of increasing the
utility of one’s descendants, the benefits of which are incorporated into one’s well-being. Standard structural
modelling (e.g. a dynastic utility function) also naturally entails separability between labor and bequests.
65

39

function 67, there is no reason for government to engage in intertemporal distribution. But that
is not correct: it is still the case that at this moment some families have a possibly substantially
larger endowment of “ability” and capital than others, and therefore a redistributive tax would
be desirable. 68 Moreover, each period in the future, some individuals get a better roll of the
dice—given their parents, they have higher wages or higher returns on their inherited capital.
While they optimally share their good fortune with their descendants, they don’t share their
good fortune at all with others who have had a bad roll of the dice, ending up with low wages
or low returns on capital. A utilitarian would wish to redistribute income between the lucky
individual and those who had a bad roll of the dice. (Indeed, so would an individual, behind a
veil of ignorance, not knowing how the dice would roll.)
If the government can observe inherited wealth It, then, at time 0, there should obviously
be a tax on the inheritance and on returns to inherited capital. Indeed, taxing past bequests
(capital that individuals have already inherited) at 100% is non-distortionary and would thus be
part of a utilitarian optimal tax program. Of course, this is just the standard paradox of capital
taxation: in the absence of some form of commitment, savers would know this, and there
would be no savings and investment. There has to be some way that governments can make a
credible commitment not to impose such taxes. We do not answer that question here, but
rather ask, if the government could make a credible commitment to say a fixed inheritance tax
and/or return to capital, how would those taxes be determined? 69 With such a commitment,
the government must balance the benefits of greater equality across families with reduced
intertemporal smoothing of consumption within the dynastic (and more broadly, other aspects

And putting aside the fact noted above that in a utilitarian framework, a bequest gives utility to both the giver
and the receiver.
68
One obviously cannot study this effect in a model in which, starting at time 0, all individuals begin with the same
wealth and ability, and making random draws going forward. In that world, at time 0, there would be no need for
taxation; but subsequent periods would begin with wealth and ability inequalities and redistributive taxation
would be desirable. Of course, at time 0, individuals would know this, and that would affect behavior at time 0
69
No democratic government can make such commitments, and it is apparent that different parties have different
views about the appropriate tax rate. Much political campaigning centers around such issues. Each party should
however take into account the likelihood that a successor government would change tax rates and the effect of
perceptions that this might be so on behavior. One can reconcile observed behavior, e.g. of the Republican Party in
the US, as they adopt regressive taxation—which are more likely to be reversed with the next Democratic period of
control-- with this perspective by assuming that they have become increasingly short sighted, perhaps because of a
belief in declining probabilities of success in future elections; see Korinek and Stiglitz (2008,2009 ).

of deadweight loss associated with distortionary taxation.) In principle, the optimal tax
function would relate the tax paid by individual at time t to all observables related to his
current behavior and past history (i.e. to 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 , 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 for all t ≤ to, where to is today’s date)), since such
data (together with knowledge of the stochastic processes) convey information about relevant
current period variables, in particular 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 (the individual’s ability). For instance, if ability were
perfectly inherited, information from previous periods’ incomes of the parents perfectly

conveys information about the individual’s current ability. If there is a high correlation, past
data would still convey considerable information. (Since the standard models assume
markovian processes for ability, only the previous period income is relevant. 70)
Of course, individuals know this, and if they care about their descendants, as assumed
here, their behavior would correspondingly adjust. This can have profound consequences,
including that the equilibrium is not a separating equilibrium (as in the previous sections of this
paper) but a pooling one. 71 We thus have to compare the level of social welfare with the
optimal tax of the form 𝑇𝑇(𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 , 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡−1 , 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 , 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡−1 ) with that generated simply by a tax of the form:

𝑇𝑇(𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 , 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 ). In the latter case, taxes would have to take into account the self-selection constraints
described in previous sections of the paper. 72

Societal implications of inequalities of wealth and inheritance
Should society be concerned with consumption inequalities within a generation, with
inequalities in dynastic utility, or with inequalities in wealth? Societies with large wealth
inequalities are different; large wealth inequalities are associated with inequalities in political
power and access to privilege. If society is concerned with excessive inequalities in wealth,
then progressive inheritance taxes may be desirable, even if they cause “dead weight” losses in
utility, in inducing excessive consumption of an individual within his lifetime. Concerns about
extremes of inequalities in lifetime consumption can then be addressed separately by a
progressive lifetime consumption tax.

There is some evidence that the ability generating process is not so simple, e.g. that characteristics of the
grandparents may affect the grandchildren independently of the state of the child.
71
See Roberts (1982) and Stiglitz (2009b)
72
In our earlier analysis, we implicitly assumed that the government did not make use of the information implicit in
the inheritability of ability. But while using such information would almost surely be viewed as politically
unacceptable, inheritances are correlated with income of previous generations.
70

41

Bequests as a source of inequality may be viewed as particularly iniquitous, because such
bequests mean that there is not a level playing field; there is no equality of opportunity. 73
While society cannot create a perfectly level playing field, there are some forms of inequality—
those associated with the transmission of financial wealth—which can be redressed. The
question again are the costs of doing so. Since the marginal costs of small distortions is small,
and, given the large inequities which currently exist, the marginal benefit of the corresponding
reduction in inequalities arising from inheritance taxes and taxes on non-life-cycle capital
income are large, there is a presumption in favor of such taxes.
VII. Optimal Taxation in a Two-Class Model
A simplification in which these perspectives can be investigated more closely and which
captures well key elements of a modern capitalist economy entails workers in an overlapping
generations model and a second group with so much inherited wealth that their wealth dwarfs
their wage income, and so we ignore it. The latter group we refer to as capitalists; the former
as workers. We focus on the differences in well-being between these two groups, rather than
differences within each group. 74.
Total capital in the economy is workers’ capital and capitalists’ capital, generating a two
class model along the lines studied earlier by Pasinetti (1962), Modigliani and Samuelson (1966)
and Stiglitz (1967, 2015). We extend the model here by introducing utility maximizing workers
and capitalists. 75 Capitalists maximize a standard intertemporal utility function with discount
factor 1/δ. We normalize by assuming workers have a (fixed) population of unity, capitalists of
It is worth noting that equality of opportunity is a distinctively different norm that that associated with, say,
maximizing an inequality averse dynastic social welfare function. (Kanbur and Stiglitz (2015, 2016)). Equality of
opportunity says the probability that an individual will be in any given decile during his life is independent of the
decile of his parents. A two period egalitarian family social welfare function 𝑊𝑊 = 𝑊𝑊(𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡 , 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡+1 ) would seek to
compensate an individual whose father is poor (and therefore whose childhood has more likely been spent in
poverty) with higher income, calling for a quite different transition matrix.
74
With stochastic wages and returns to capital, these can be analyzed along the lines of Stiglitz (2015). As
discussed in the previous section, Pareto efficient taxation within each group can be analyzed in standard models
such as those presented in earlier sections of this paper.
75
Thus, we generalize Mattauch et al (2016) and Mattauch et al (2017). Their models used logarithmic utility
functions for both capitalists and workers, which naturally generate the kinds of fixed savings rates assumed by the
earlier literature. Mattauch et al 2017 focused on ascertaining the conditions under which in equilibrium all
capital was held by workers. Here, we assume that the tax rates on capital (or on capitalists) are low enough that
this is not so.
73

42

N, so capitalists’ consumption is N Cc. We simplify the analysis by assuming the government
simply wishes to maximize workers’ steady state consumption. 76 We assume, for simplicity,
that the labor supply is fixed (at unity as well). 77 Here, we assume all revenues from taxation
are spent on education. Later subsections will generalize the results. Then output, Q, is a
constant returns to scale function of (private) capital, K, and effective labor, which is a function
of investment in human capital per capita, which, noting that labor supply has been normalized
at unity, can be written as 𝜙𝜙�𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 �, with 𝜙𝜙′�𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 � ≥ 0 and 𝜙𝜙"�𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 � ≤ 0. So 𝑄𝑄 = 𝐹𝐹 �𝐾𝐾, 𝜙𝜙�𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 ��.

Investments in education increase productivity, but there are diminishing returns. Because of
constant returns to scale in capital and effective labor, we can write:
(20) 𝑄𝑄 = 𝜙𝜙 𝑓𝑓(𝐾𝐾/𝜙𝜙) = 𝜙𝜙 𝑓𝑓(𝑘𝑘)
𝐾𝐾

where 𝑘𝑘 = 𝜙𝜙 the capital-“effective labor” ratio. We assume a tax rate of τ on the net return to

capital. 78 This implies that in long run equilibrium 𝑘𝑘 is given by:
(21) 1 + r = (1 − 𝜏𝜏)(𝑓𝑓 ′ − 𝜂𝜂) = 𝛿𝛿

where r is the (after tax net) rate of return on capital, η is the rate of depreciation and the tax
is applied only to net returns. The after tax net return to capital is simply related to the pure
rate of time discount. (22) determines the equilibrium value of k as a function of τ (given η and
δ). 79
(22) 𝑘𝑘 = 𝜓𝜓(𝜏𝜏) , with 𝜓𝜓′ (𝜏𝜏) = δ/(1 – τ)2f’’ < 0.

We denote by ko the value of k when τ = 0: ko ≡ 𝜓𝜓(0). Tax revenue is 𝜏𝜏 (𝑓𝑓 ′ − 𝜂𝜂)𝐾𝐾, all of which
is spent on public education. Hence
𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏

(23) 𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 = 𝜏𝜏 (𝑓𝑓 ′ − 𝜂𝜂)𝐾𝐾 = 1− 𝜏𝜏 𝐾𝐾 =

𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏

1− 𝜏𝜏

𝜓𝜓𝜓𝜓

Similar results obtain if we analyze more generally Pareto efficient tax structures, or tax structures which
maximize a more general inequality averse social welfare function, so long as the disparity between the two
groups is large enough, so that the marginal social utility of consumption of capitalists relative to that of workers is
small enough.
77
Thus, while earlier sections focused on the issue of the labor supply elasticity, here our concern is on savings.
Results on the desirability of capital taxation would be strengthened by allowing a positive labor supply elasticity.
78
Again, similar results obtain if one can differentiate between taxes on capital for workers and that of capitalists,
or if capitalists engage in some tax avoidance activities, to convert some of their capital income into what appears
as wage income.
79
Throughout the analysis below, we assume we are in an equilibrium in which there are capitalists. See Pasinetti
(1962), Modigliani and Samuelson (1966) and Stiglitz (1967, 2015, 2016) and Mattauch et al 2017.

where 𝑔𝑔(𝑘𝑘) = 𝑓𝑓 − 𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓 ′ is the return per unit of effective labor. Hence

depends just on {𝑤𝑤, 𝑟𝑟}= {w, δ} which from (23) and (24) depends just on 𝜏𝜏.

Taking the logarithmic derivative of w (from (24)), we can establish the tax rate that

maximizes workers’ welfare (and, given social weights that put little weight on capitalists wellbeing approximately societal welfare). Increasing 𝜏𝜏 increases Kg but decreases k and hence g,
the wage per efficiency unit. The optimal tax balances the two effects:

where 𝑎𝑎 = 𝑑𝑑(𝑏𝑏+𝑐𝑐) , 𝑐𝑐 =

𝜎𝜎

𝐾𝐾 ) (𝛿𝛿/𝑟𝑟)

, where σ = elasticity of

substitution and 𝑆𝑆𝐾𝐾 = 𝑓𝑓’𝑘𝑘/𝑓𝑓 . The larger is the elasticity of the return to human capital

ζ , the larger 𝜏𝜏 ∗ ; and the larger the elasticity of substitution, the smaller is the adverse effect on

wages of an increase, and thus the larger is 𝜏𝜏 ∗ . Hence, we have:

Proposition 8a: Provided 0 < 𝜁𝜁 < 1, there is a strictly positive positive tax rate on capital
taxation to finance education. 81

These results assume that there is no productive public investment to augment the
productivity of capital goods and no transfers. More generally, the total income of a worker
with transfers but net of labor taxes t are given by
𝑊𝑊 = 𝜙𝜙(𝑓𝑓 − 𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓 ′ ) + 𝜏𝜏 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 − 𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 − 𝐾𝐾𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 - t
80
81

If they don’t, then 𝐾𝐾𝑤𝑤 = S (𝑤𝑤, 𝑟𝑟), and the analysis proceeds much as below.
A tax levied only on the capital earnings of capitalists would be even more favorable to workers.

where 𝐾𝐾𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 is investment in public capital goods allocated to augmenting capital productivity,

and K represents as before just private capital. Output is a CRTS function of effective labor,
𝐾𝐾𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 and K: 𝑄𝑄 = 𝐹𝐹�𝐾𝐾, 𝐾𝐾𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 , 𝜙𝜙(𝐾𝐾𝑔𝑔 )𝐿𝐿�.

If the tax were only used to finance lump sum transfers to workers, then workers’ (after

transfer) wage is given by 𝑊𝑊 = 𝑔𝑔(𝑘𝑘) + 𝜏𝜏(𝑓𝑓 ′ − 𝜂𝜂)𝑘𝑘. At τ = 0,
But straightforward differentiation shows that for τ > 0,

public capital investments are not too “capital augmenting,” then workers’ incomes are
increased by an increase in capital taxation with revenues used for capital augmenting public
capital (even with capital goods capturing the direct returns.)
On the other hand, if the funds are spent on capital goods that substitute for private capital
goods, then the aggregate capital labor ratio need not even fall; even with limited productive
human capital investments, workers’ income (through an increase in wages and/or transfers)

This formulation is chosen so that the production function is constant returns to scale. It is assumed that the
government does not appropriate directly the returns to public capital goods, but rather, the returns are
appropriately by the owners of capital goods (just as the returns to human capital are appropriated by workers)

may increase, and so will their welfare.83 With the return to capitalists’ capital below the
critical threshold, they eventually consume their wealth. The economy is supported then by
public investment. This result holds even if public investment is not as productive as private
investment, so long as it is not too much less.
The central point is simple: while a capital tax the proceeds of which are simply
distributed to workers hurts workers because of adverse incidence effects, under quite general
conditions84, with an equalitarian social welfare function it is desirable to impose a tax on
capitalists’ return to capital, and with large disparities in income between capitalists and
workers, strong equalitarianism, and high productivity of investments in human capital, the
optimal tax on capital may be very high. If tax revenues are invested in capital goods which
either increase the productivity of private capital good (but not too much) or substitute for
private capital goods, then again taxation on capital is desirable. Indeed, in the latter case, a
tax on capital over the long run may result in capitalists consuming all of their capital.
VIII. Concluding Remarks
It is remarkable that so much of the policy literature has focused on simplistic models in
which differences among individuals were limited, arising mostly out of differences in wage
incomes. The Atkinson Stiglitz 1976 model was useful in reminding us that the role of
commodity taxation had to be seen in conjunction with other taxes that were in place as well as
taxes that we might have wanted to have in place, but which are not there—a general principle
of considerable importance. When there was an optimal non-linear income tax, the role of
commodity taxation was limited. Its role could be seen in two ways. First, as improving the
before tax (market) distribution of income, putting less of a burden on distortionary
redistributive taxes. Alternatively, it could be seen as part of the general theory of corrective
That is, if Q = F(K + KPI, L), then the expenditures on public capital goods drives down the after tax rate of interest
so that (f’ – η)(1 – τ) < δ, in which case capitalist start to “eat” their capital. To ensure that capital taxation does
not decrease wages, it must be the case that π > sp, where π = relative productivity of public investment and 1 - sp
is the fraction of profits consumed (“wasted” on capitalists).
84
The result can be shown to hold with more general utility functions for capitalists (e.g. recursive Koopmans
functions, so that the long run interest rate need not be invariant to tax policy.) It also holds with different
specifications of taxation, e.g. a wealth tax on capitalists, or a tax on intergenerational transfers, rather than a tax
on their net income.
83

taxation. Whenever there are self-selection constraints in an economy, there will be a first
order distortion, and commodity taxation can be used to reduce the magnitude of that
distortion. This is true whether the self-selection constraint arises purely within the private
public sector – from the government attempting to engage in redistributive taxation – or also
within the private sector – from the more-able individuals attempting to appropriate their
ability rents. The presence of self-selection constraints represents a big wedge, a big distortion,
in the economy. It is worth creating a small distortion elsewhere in the economy if it can reduce
the size of this wedge.85
Public investment too needs to take into account its effects on the market distribution of
income, and how it alters the distribution of income and self-selection constraints within the
economy. In general, even asymptotically and even with separability, the rate of discount for
public investment varies across public projects, and may be greater or less than the social rate
of discount.
There are many other limitations to the basic Atkinson-Stiglitz model that we have not
explored here. We have, in particular, assumed the absence of tax evasion and avoidance, and
in particular the ability to shift income from one category to another. In practice, it is often
difficult to distinguish between capital and labor income, especially for self-employed
individuals; and if that is the case, large differences in tax rates provides large incentives to
convert wage income into capital income. 86
This is perhaps related to one of the deepest criticisms of the literature on optimal nonlinear taxes: in practice, there are many restraints. We have noted, for instance, if government
is restrained to using a linear income tax, commodity taxation is still desirable. The rationale is
Thus, it is desirable to introduce random taxation, even though all individuals are risk averse, if by doing
so the self-selection constraints are relaxed. See Stiglitz (1982b) and Brito et al. (1995).
86
There are, of course, several other widely noted limitations on the model, which limit the direct applicability of
the result: (a) Hours may be partially observable, in which case government would want to use that information;
and (b) there may be large stochastic elements in the translation of labor, given an individual’s ability and effort,
into income. In dynamic models, as we noted earlier, observations of an individual in time t are relevant to
inferences at subsequent dates (and this may even be true of observations of an individual’s parents). Optimal
taxation ought to make use of that information, but if individuals know this, it affects behavior. In effect, the
models here entail a commitment on the part of government not to use such information. The models here are
adverse selection models. There are also important incentive effects, e.g. in effort and education. Thus, a full
analysis would include both effects, with incentive compatability constraints added to the self-selection
constraints. (For a discussion of optimal taxation with moral hazard, see Arnott and Stiglitz, 1986.)
85

47

somewhat different from that presented above. Such taxation may improve the before tax
distribution of income, as we have emphasized, but even if does not do this, it may enable us,
with little social deadweight loss, to improve the after tax and transfer distribution of income,
and thus social welfare. A tax on perfume may generate significant revenues from a subset of
high income individuals—individuals who are such that with even an optimal linear income tax
have a much lower social marginal utility than poor individuals. Similarly, for a bread subsidy.
Though as Deaton noted, with linear expenditure systems, one can’t achieve improvements
through perfume taxes and bread subsidies, there may be significant departures from those
patterns of expenditure.
This leads to the question: why the restraints. There are obvious advantages to
simplicity, but when one looks at the tax code, it is clear that simplicity itself was not the
guiding principle. Making the tax system non-linear, with several brackets, adds virtually no
cost in a modern computer driven tax system, raising a key point: what is costly or feasible
depends on technology, and that changes over time—with some changes endogenously driven.
When Vickrey advocated the use of congestion taxes, a good congestion tax could not have
been implemented. But advances in technology now make the administrative costs associated
with imposing taxes low. Economists often refer to political costs, but my experience with
“political constraints” is that they are soft and ambiguous. What seems like an insurmountable
barrier at one time can be suddenly overcome, especially as economists explain the high costs
of such a constraint. I had argued some quarter a century ago that there would be substantial
benefits from substantially increasing the standard deduction, moving many individuals out of
the income tax net and reducing the importance of many key distortionary deductions and
credits but it was claimed doing so was politically infeasible; suddenly, in 2017, in the US, it
happened. I would have thought that in a democracy, a tax cut for billionaires financed by tax
increases for lower income individuals would be infeasible; again, in 2017, it happened.
There are two sets of constraints for which there are important rationale. One is that
large differential tax rates, say between capital and labor, open up large opportunities for
arbitrage. Similarly, for large differential rates among classes of similar activities. More
broadly, there are limitations in what government can observe, and what it can define
48

precisely, and those limitations provide openings for arbitrage and distortions. When there are
large differences in marginal tax rates, money can be shifted from one person (say in a family)
to another. Much of the complexity of the tax system arises from these forms of
differentiation, and any tax structure needs to take this into account. 87
Most importantly, there is a simple reason to tax the returns to capital of the very rich: it is
equitable. With any equality-preferring social welfare function with sufficient weight on equity,
the benefits in terms of social equity would outweigh the distortionary effects, given the
disparities in incomes observed in advanced countries such as the United States. The
intertemporal distortions in consumption patterns affect the very rich, when the tax is levied
only on very high incomes. But even if a capital tax is also levied on workers it may be
desirable. If the proceeds of the tax are invested in ways which sufficiently enhance the
productivity of workers and/or provide sufficiently highly valued public goods, workers are
better off, and the gains to the workers more than offset the losses to the “capitalists” who
bear the tax. We have shown that, in general, the adverse incidence effect on workers as a
result of capitalists’ reduced savings can be offset. With the standard utilitarian social welfare
functions, with the degree of concavity conventionally assumed, there can be even
considerable inefficiency in public investments, and still capital taxes would be desirable.
All of this has been predicated on individualistic inequality averse social welfare functions.
But there is increasing awareness that inequality itself may have an adverse effect on societal
well-being, and even productivity. 88 There is an increasing awareness that living in an unequal
society changes the nature of society and that of those that live within it, with effects on
preferences and behavior of both those at the top and the bottom that would widely be agreed

87
In 1985, I set out a general theory of tax avoidance. It is particularly difficult for the government to impose
different taxes on things which are similar (but still different). Defining the relevant differences can be
extraordinarily difficult, and thus it may be necessary to tax the different commodities at the same rate.
All of modern tax theory begins, of course, with the hypothesis that certain things (like ability) are not
observable. In fact, different things are observed with different degrees of accuracy.
88
Standard theory takes individuals’ preference and behavior as given, but recent advances in behavioral
economics have shown that these are endogenous and have identified many ways in which these are affected by
the nature of the society in which individuals are embedded, including the magnitude and nature of the
inequalities. See Hoff and Stiglitz (2016, 2017).

49

to be adverse.89 Indeed, there is increasing evidence that inequality itself may affect
productivity.90 Once we take these consequences of inequality into account, the case for a
progressive tax on the income from capital, and in particular, taxing the return to what we have
identified as “capitalists’ capital” at a high rate becomes even more compelling.
I believe that Tony would have agreed with these conclusions.

Figure 1(a)
The required revenue 𝑅𝑅� can be raised in a Pareto efficient way which gives individual 1 utility

����
𝑈𝑈1 by a non-linear income tax (dotted line) which confronts both types with zero marginal tax
rates. At E2*, high ability individuals do not want to mimic low ability individuals.

T
Figure 1(b)
The more normal case: at maximal revenue associated with ����
𝑈𝑈1 , point E1’, we can identify the
maximal revenue we can extract from high ability, by drawing type 2’s indifference curve

through E1’. The maximal revenue corresponds to point E2’. It is insufficient to raise required
revenue 𝑅𝑅� . We thus have to impose a higher tax on 2, lowering his utility, which result in his

mimicking 1 if we had left 1 at E1’. We force 1 to work less, moving him to E1*, raising less from
the low ability types, necessitating an even higher tax on the high ability. At the (Pareto)
efficient tax, type 2 is indifferent between his optimal point (E2*) and the low ability’s optimal

point E1*. The Pareto efficient allocation can be implemented through a tax which is linear with
slope equal to that of type 1 at E1* (i.e. effectively a demi-grant plus a positive tax rate), then at
some income level above Y1* but below Y2*, a high (infinite) tax rate, and then above a critical
threshold somewhat below Y2*, a zero marginal tax rate. There are many tax schedules that can
implement the Pareto efficient allocation. This is not so when there are a continuum of types,
for then we have to be sensitive to marginal tax rates at every income level.

By producing at B rather than at E, the economy can consume less than it otherwise could
have. The effective loss in output in terms of good 1 is measured by AB.
