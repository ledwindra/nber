    "abstract": "\n\nHow, when, and why did women in the US obtain legal rights equal to men\u2019s regarding the workplace, marriage, family, Social Security, criminal justice, credit markets, and other parts of the economy and society, decades after they gained the right to vote? The story begins with the civil rights movement and the somewhat fortuitous nature of the early and key women\u2019s rights legislation. The women\u2019s movement formed and pressed for further rights. Of the 155 critical moments in women\u2019s rights history I\u2019ve compiled from 1905 to 2023, 45% occurred between 1963 and 1973. The greatly increased employment of women, the formation of women\u2019s rights associations, the belief that women\u2019s votes mattered, and the unstinting efforts of various members of Congress were behind the advances. But women soon became splintered by marital status, employment, region, and religion far more than men. A substantial group of women emerged in the 1970s to oppose various rights for women, just as they did during the suffrage movement. They remain a potent force today.\n\n",
