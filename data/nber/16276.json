    "abstract": "\n\nWe analyze whether preferential trade agreements (PTAs) affect the incidence and pattern of antidumping (AD) filings.  We estimate AD provisions in PTAs have decreased the incidence of intra-PTA AD cases by 33-55% and have increased the number of AD actions against non-PTA members by 10-30%.  The net effect of PTA rules on total AD filings is small.  Our results are robust to alternative estimation approaches and controlling for a myriad of other PTA-related phenomena.  Our results suggest a protection analogue to the \"trade creation-trade diversion\" impact of PTAs.  PTA members are spared from AD actions but non-PTA members face even greater AD scrutiny.\n\n",
