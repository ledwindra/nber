    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the regional distribution of public employment in Italy.  It documents two sets of facts.  This first is the use of public employment as a subsidy from the North to the less wealthy South.  We calculate that about half of the wage bill in the South of Italy can be identified as a subsidy.  Both the size of public employment and the level of wages are used as a redistributive device.  The second set of facts concerns the effects of a subsidized public employment on individuals' attitudes toward job search, education, 'risk taking' activities etc.  Public employment discourages the development of market activities in the South.\n\n",
