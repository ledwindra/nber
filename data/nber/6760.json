    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the choice of a monetary-policy rule in a simple macroeconomic model.  In a closed economy, the optimal policy is a output and inflation.  In an open economy, the optimal rule changes in two ways.  First, the policy instrument is a Conditions Index the exchange rate.  Second, on the right side of the rule, inflation is replaced by filters out the transitory effects of exchange-rate movements. The model also implies that pure inflation targeting is dangerous in an open economy, because it creates large fluctuations in exchange rates and output.  Targeting long-run inflation avoids this problem and produces a close approximation to the optimal instrument rule.\n\n",
