ABSTRACT
We explore the effects of recent Medicaid expansions on Medicaid-financed prescriptions for
evidence-based smoking cessation medications. We estimate differences-in-differences models
using administrative data on the universe of prescription medications sold in retail and online
pharmacies for which Medicaid was a third-party payer. Our findings suggest that expansions
increased smoking cessation prescriptions by 36% with heterogeneity across medication class.
We provide evidence that these prescriptions were primarily financed by Medicaid programs and
not patients, and that our estimates reflect increases in prescriptions among newly eligible
populations and not other populations that enrolled in Medicaid due to Affordable Care Actrelated changes. Overall our findings suggest that the recent Medicaid expansions allowed newly
insured low-income smokers to access efficacious cessation medications.

1. Introduction
Smoking is the largest preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States,
leading to more than 480,000 deaths each year and accounting for 30% of all cancer deaths
annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017). Despite the well-established health
harms of smoking, the adult smoking rate remains stubbornly high at 15% (National Center for
Health Statistics 2017). There is socioeconomic disparity in smoking: lower income groups are
more likely to smoke than higher income groups (National Center for Health Statistics 2017). In
particular, within Medicaid, a public insurance program that finances healthcare services for lowincome individuals, the smoking rate is 30% (National Center for Health Statistics 2017).
This high smoking rate within the Medicaid population is troubling from a public finance
perspective as smoking-attributable Medicaid costs (e.g., cancer treatments, chronic bronchitis,
and emphysema) will be borne predominately by taxpayers. These costs are non-trivial:
smoking-related diseases accounted for 15%, or $45B, 1 of annual Medicaid expenditures
between 2006 and 2010 (Xu et al. 2015). Smoking cessation has been shown to both improve
health and reduce healthcare expenditures (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010,
Warren et al. 2014, Richard, West, and Ku 2012), suggesting that promoting cessation within
Medicaid broadly could confer substantial benefits to both government payers and enrollees.
Beginning in 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided enhanced federal matching
funds for states to expand their Medicaid programs to low-income (up to 138% of the federal
poverty level [FPL]), non-elderly, non-disabled adults. 2 For all enrollees, the ACA requires
Medicaid programs to cover Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription

Inflated from the original estimate, $39B in 2010 dollars, to 2017 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.
For states that expanded Medicaid, the federal government financed 100% of the costs for newly eligible
beneficiaries between 2014 and 2016. After that time, the federal contribution declines to 90% by 2020 and remains
at that level (Kaiser Family Foundation 2014).

cessation medications with little to no cost-sharing (DiGiulio et al. 2016). These medications are
efficacious (Biazzo et al. 2010, Ruger and Lazar 2012, Zhu et al. 2000, Aubin et al. 2008,
Cummings and Hyland 2005, Stead et al. 2012). For instance, a recent meta-analysis found that
prescription cessation medications helped 50-80% smokers quit versus a placebo (Cahill et al.
2013). While efficacious, these medications are expensive: prices range from $100 to $500 per
prescription for an uninsured smoker. 3 Low income uninsured smokers may have limited ability
to access to these medications. Indeed, Lillard et al. (2007) show that uninsured smokers are less
likely to use cessation medications in quit attempts than privately insured smokers.
Prior to the ACA, Medicaid eligibility was generally limited to children, poor parents,
pregnant women, and the disabled (‘traditional populations’). The newly eligible – primarily
low-income, non-disabled, and childless adults – have higher smoking rates and less experience
with the healthcare delivery system than traditional populations (DiGiulio et al. 2016, National
Center for Health Statistics 2014), 4 suggesting that the newly eligible may benefit from coverage
obtained through the ACA-related expansions. Recent estimates show that 2.3 million newly
eligible smokers gained access to Medicaid through the ACA expansions (DiGiulio et al. 2016),
which implies that the expansions have substantial scope to reduce smoking.
We examine the effect of ACA Medicaid eligibility expansions to newly eligible
populations on utilization of Medicaid-financed prescription medications for smoking cessation

We conducted a non-systematic review of online sales of these medications for an uninsured smoker to retrieve our
price estimates (e.g., https://www.goodrx.com/zyban; https://www.goodrx.com/chantix;
https://www.goodrx.com/nicotrol; accessed April 26th, 2017).

According to the National Center for Health Statistics official estimates, in 2013 (in advance of January 1st, 2014
when the majority of expansion states expanded Medicaid) the Medicaid smoking rate was 30%. This number
should predominately reflect the smoking rate among traditional Medicaid eligible populations. DiGuilio and
colleagues estimate a smoking rate of 38% among newly eligible enrollees. We note that these estimates are from
different sources: the 2013 estimate is based on the National Health Interview Survey and the post-ACA estimate is
based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey combined
with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System.

approved by the FDA. To this end, we draw administrative data from the Medicaid State Drug
Utilization Database (SDUD) between 2011 and 2015. These data cover the universe of
prescription medication claims purchased from retail and online pharmacies for which Medicaid
was a third-party payer. While prescription fills do not directly capture medication use, previous
research documents that fills are a reliable proxy (Lehmann et al. 2014). Moreover, fills are
common proxies within economics (Richards et al. 2017, Ghosh, Simon, and Sommers 2017).
We contribute to the small literature that examines the impact of expanding access to
efficacious cessation medications within Medicaid in five important ways. (i) We examine the
effect of expanding coverage to newly eligible Medicaid populations, which have very high
smoking rates and have had little access to insurance previously. (ii) Our use of the SDUD
offers us access to the universe of Medicaid-financed prescription medications sold through retail
and online pharmacies, while previous studies have relied on survey data, which are vulnerable
to measurement error, or claims data that lack detailed payer information. (iii) Our data contain
information on Medicaid payments which we leverage to explore whether changes in
prescriptions were financed by Medicaid or patients. (iv) Because the medications we study
require a formal prescription from a healthcare provider, we are able to indirectly explore the
newly Medicaid-eligible smokers’ ability to access primary care services and to navigate the
changing U.S. healthcare delivery system, with which they have little experience. (v) We study
an important behavioral intermediary outcome: use of prescription cessation medications. The
literature on the smoking effects of ACA Medicaid expansions, which has examined selfreported smoking in survey settings, is decidedly mixed (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017,
Courtemanche et al. 2017a), perhaps because cessation takes time and studies rely on, at most,
two years of post-2014 data. If cessation medications are a mechanism through which these

4

insurance expansions assist smokers quit, then we should observe changes in prescriptions prior
to changes in reported smoking status. Further, when assessing the value of a large-scale policy
intervention such as the ACA, understanding how the intervention affected healthcare service
use is important independent of intervention benefits (i.e., cessation).
Our results suggest that expanding Medicaid to newly eligible populations increased
utilization of smoking cessation medications: post expansion Medicaid-financed prescription
medications for smoking cessation increased by 36% in expansion states relative to nonexpansion states with effects driven primarily by Zyban; the lowest cost FDA-approved
prescription medication for cessation. A dynamic model documents that effects increased over
time, which implies that we may observe more definitive evidence of smoking reductions
attributable to Medicaid expansion as time passes. Further, we document that these cessation
medications were primarily financed by state Medicaid programs and not patients. Finally,
prescription effects appear to be driven by increases in newly eligible populations and not other
groups that enrolled in Medicaid due to ACA-related policy changes.
This manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the Medicaid
program, outlines a conceptual model, and discusses the related literature. Data, variables, and
methods are presented in Section 3. Main results are reported in Section 4, and extensions and
sensitivity analyses are presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 provides a discussion.
2. Medicaid, conceptual framework, and prior literature
2.1 The Medicaid program
Medicaid finances healthcare services, including cessation services, for low income
people. Medicaid is a federal and state program, with states establishing policies within a set of

5

federal laws. Prior to the ACA, Medicaid eligibility for non-elderly adults in most states was
limited to people with disabilities, pregnant women, and parents of poor children.
The ACA originally mandated all states expand Medicaid or lose federal Medicaid
funding. In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that states were not required to expand eligibility to
retain federal funding. This ruling left Medicaid expansion optional to states. The decision to
expand Medicaid was largely determined by the party controlling the state’s lower legislative
chamber (Sobel 2014, Courtemanche et al. 2017b).
Starting in 2014, the federal government generously subsidized states’ expansions of
Medicaid eligibility to most residents with incomes below 138% of the FPL; the threshold is
133% and there is an additional 5 percentage point disregard in both expansion and nonexpansion states. 5 By 2017, 32 states, including the District of Columbia, had expanded their
Medicaid programs under the ACA, and adults covered under this provision are referred to as
‘newly eligible.’ For non-expansion states, starting January 1st, 2014, the 5 percentage point
disregard (‘disregard’) increased income eligibility thresholds for traditional groups by 5
percentage points of FPL over the state’s March 2010 income thresholds. Populations that
gained coverage through this increase are not termed newly eligible.
Prior to the ACA, states had substantial discretion in deciding what services to cover in
their Medicaid programs, and coverage of cessation products varied considerably (Singleterry et
al. 2014). Starting in January 2014, section 2502 of the Act required states to cover FDA-

5

In most states, childless adults of any income level were not eligible for Medicaid prior to the ACA. In early 2010,
only 6 states (Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont) used federal waivers to offer
full Medicaid benefits to childless adults, and although 12 states offered limited benefits to this population, many of
these latter programs were closed to new applicants (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2009).
Using the early expansion option of the ACA, 5 additional states (California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey
and Washington) expanded eligibility to childless adults before 2014. In 2010, the District of Columbia, however,
was the only jurisdiction to use the early expansion option to provide for full benefits to 200% of FPL; others had
income thresholds below 138% FPL or limited eligibility to adults who were in older state-funded programs.

approved cessation products, both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, for all
Medicaid enrollees. These products include the prescription cessation medications
Zyban/bupropion (‘Zyban’) and Chantix/varenicline (‘Chantix’), and nicotine replacement
therapies (NRT) such as patches, gum, lozenges, nasal sprays, and inhalers (Food and Drug
Administration 2015). NRTs are available OTC and through formal prescriptions: patches, gum,
and lozenges are available OTC while nasal sprays and inhalers require a prescription. The ACA
does not regulate utilization management techniques for these medications but the Act does
encourage removing cost-sharing (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2012).
The ACA Medicaid changes most relevant to our study are the increased number of
enrollees and improved coverage for prescription cessation medications. These changes have
implications for a study of ACA Medicaid expansions on smoking among the newly eligible.
Increases in the number of Medicaid enrollees are attributable to coverage increases in
three groups: newly eligible adults, previously eligible individuals who opted to take up
Medicaid post-expansion; i.e., ‘welcome mat’ effects (Sonier, Boudreaux, and Blewett 2013),
and individuals who became eligible in non-expansion states due to the disregard. Our data –
administrative counts of Medicaid-financed prescription medications – do not allow us to
distinguish between these groups, but we attempt to isolate newly eligible effects. 6 We next
review the available evidence and our approaches to isolating newly eligible effects.
Frean, Gruber, and Sommers (2017) show that welcome mat effects are similar across
expansion and non-expansion states. Our empirical model (differences-in-differences) can
account for common shocks to expansion and non-expansion states through inclusion of period
fixed effects. Under the assumption that welcome-mat effects are common across states, we are

6

This limitation is common within the ACA-Medicaid expansion literature that relies on administrative or survey
data (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017, Miller and Wherry 2017, Wherry and Miller 2016, Wen et al. 2017).

7

able to empirically account for these effects. 7 Because the income disregard changes affect
populations at different levels of the income distribution (i.e., within 5 percentage points of the
state’s March 2010 income eligibility threshold), these effects are not subsumed by the state or
period fixed effects included in our differences-in-differences models. Hence, our baseline
regression model cannot discriminate between newly eligible and those individuals who became
eligible due to the income disregard changes.
To dig deeper into this question, we estimate three extensions to the main analysis.
Specifically, we (i) estimate a triple difference-style model that leverages variation in pre-ACA
Medicaid total enrollment and post-ACA newly eligible enrollment to isolate effects for the
newly-eligible from other groups that enrolled in Medicaid due to the ACA; (ii) separately study
managed care (MC) Medicaid financed prescriptions as the newly-eligibles are disproportionally
enrolled in MC plans (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2016); 8 and (iii)
select a sample of states for which we can separate newly eligible effects from income disregard
effects. While each of these explorations of the data has important limitations and caveats,
collectively the results generated in these extensions imply that our results are primarily
attributable to changes in prescription medications within newly eligible enrollees.
The ACA increased coverage for cessation services in states that had limited coverage of
these services before the Act was implemented. For traditional populations, increased coverage
for cessation medications plausibly increased service use. These changes, if present, imply that
our estimates will capture both increased utilization among the newly eligible enrollees and
among traditional enrollees that gained improved coverage for cessation services. We address

7

Moreover, Frean, Gruber, and Sommers (2017) show that the ACA Medicaid expansions did not lead to
measureable crowd-out of private insurance.
8
For instance, in 2017 27 expansion states had MC plans and in 25 of these states, 80% or more of the newly
eligible were enrolled in MC plans and in 17 states over 90% were enrolled in MC plans (Paradise 2017).

8

this issue by focusing on states that experienced no change in coverage for these medications
during our study period; thus effects in this sample should largely reflect effects for populations
that enrolled in Medicaid and not previously eligible populations that gained improved coverage
for cessation services. We find that our results are not sensitive to this sample selection, which
suggests that our findings are not fully explained by continuously enrolled populations. 9
In summary, while we cannot fully rule out the possibility that our estimates of newly
eligible effects are contaminated by other groups affected by ACA Medicaid changes, we
contend that our estimates largely reflect changes among the newly elgibles.
2.2 Conceptual framework
The Grossman (1972) model of the demand for health and healthcare services motivates
our study. In the Grossman model consumers do not demand healthcare services per se, but
instead they demand the health improvements attributable to utilization of such services.
In our study, consumers seeking to improve health by quitting their smoking addiction
could plausibly demand smoking cessation prescription medications. Consumers maximize a
utility function given the price of healthcare services and other goods, preferences, a health
endowment, a health production function, other factors that determine health, and a budget
constraint. Consumers are assumed to respond to healthcare price changes in a manner
comparable to other goods and services. We investigate the effect of recent Medicaid
expansions on demand for smoking cessation medications. Medicaid – by reducing the out-ofpocket price – should increase the quantity of cessation medications demanded by consumers.

9

A comparable concern is that early expansion states (Table 1) were not required to cover cessation services
between their expansion date and January 1st, 2014. As discussed later in the manuscript, we have excluded these
states from our analysis and results are not appreciably different (see Table 16).

9

There are several factors unique to either Medicaid or addictive goods such as cigarettes
which may mute price effects. (i) Insurance does not always reduce out-of-pocket prices as
many providers do not accept Medicaid, indeed a major concern among ACA policy makers was
lack of provider participation in Medicaid (Decker 2012). (iii) Ex ante moral hazard suggests
that, by lowering smoking-attributable healthcare costs, insurance may incentivize individuals –
who no longer face the full costs of their health behaviors – to delay or deter smoking cessation
(Klick and Stratmann 2006). 10 (iv) If insurance acts as an in-kind income transfer to the newly
eligible, and if smoking is a normal good (Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban 2014), the newly
eligible may in fact increase smoking. (v) Finally, other ACA-related changes (e.g.,
communication efforts, simplification of the enrollment process) may amplify Medicaid effects
through non-price channels (Frean, Gruber, and Sommers 2016).
The question of whether, and to what extent, ACA Medicaid expansions lead to changes
in prescription cessation medications is ultimately an empirical question. While our differencesin-differences methods will not allow us to explore these specific pathways, our objective is to
provide evidence on the net effect. Moreover, the decision to expand Medicaid is the most direct
policy lever under consideration among states.
2.3 Literature
We review literature on the price elasticity of demand for cessation medications and the
related Medicaid literature.
While there is a substantial economic literature that estimates the elasticity of demand for
cigarettes (Tauras et al. 2016, Maclean, Webber, and Marti 2014, Pesko et al. 2016, Decicca et
al. 2008, Chaloupka and Warner 2000, Gallet and List 2003), a relatively small set of studies has

10

We note that an ex post moral hazard story would suggest that cessation medication use will increase postexpansion in expanding states.

10

estimated price elasticities for cessation medications. These studies are informative for our work
as insurance reduces the out-of-pocket price for cessation medications. Tauras and Chaloupka
(2003) estimate that the average own-price elasticity of demand for a nicotine patches and gum
were -2.3 and -2.5 respectively, suggesting that smokers’ demand for these products is highly
elastic. Paterson et al. (2008) and Marti (2012) show, using choice experiments, that smokers
were less likely to choose a cessation medication when its price was experimentally increased.
While not formally estimating a price elasticity of demand, Keeler et al. (2002) document that
when a cessation medication became available OTC, rather than requiring a prescription from a
provider which is costly to the consumer, the quantity demanded of this product increased.
Several studies show that pre-ACA Medicaid expansions – which primarily affected
traditional populations – increased utilization of cessation medications and reduced smoking.
The extent to which these findings can generalize to the ACA’s newly eligible adults is unclear.
Liu (2009) documents higher smoking cessation rates among non-elderly adult women residing
in states with a higher composite index of Medicaid coverage for cessation medications. Liu
(2010) shows that Medicaid coverage increased quit attempts while Greene, Sacks, and
McMenamin (2014) find that reduced cost-sharing led to higher cessation rates among Medicaid
recipients. Adams et al. (2013) and Jarlenski et al. (2014) show that Medicaid participation, and
enrollment and coverage policies reduced maternal smoking. Witman (2013) documents that
expanded Medicaid coverage reduced smoking by 6% among low-income individuals who report
ever smoking. Richards et al. (2017) use insurance claims show that coverage increased
utilization by 20 prescriptions for Zyban and Chantix per 10,000 persons. 11

11

A limitation of the Richards study is that the authors were not able to explore payer source.

11

The early literature evaluating the ACA Medicaid expansions finds evidence that
prescription medications increased, but no study examines cessation medications. 12 Medicaidfinanced prescription utilization increased by 19% in expansion states relative to non-expansion
states (Ghosh, Simon, and Sommers 2017). Wen et al. (2017) show that utilization of Medicaidfinanced buprenorphine (a medication used to treat opioid use disorder) prescriptions increased
by 70% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. Maclean and Saloner (2017) find
that use of Medicaid-financed medications used to treat a wider set of substance use disorders, all
FDA-approved medications to treat alcohol and drug use disorders (but not smoking cessation),
increased by 43% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. Finally, Maclean et al.
(2017) show that, post-expansion, prescriptions for psychotropic medications used to treat
mental illness increased 22% in expanding states relative to non-expanding states. Importantly,
these papers do not attempt to isolate effects for the newly eligible and, instead, plausibly capture
effects for newly eligible, previously eligible populations that enrolled due to welcome mat
effects, and populations that become eligible due to income disregard changes.
The effects of the ACA Medicaid expansions on smoking are mixed which is not entirely
surprising as studies rely on just two years of post-2014 data and the transition from smoking to
cessation is time-intensive. Longitudinal evidence suggests that a smoker attempts to quit on
average 30 times or more before successfully quitting for 1 year or longer (Chaiton et al. 2016).
Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017) find that Medicaid expansion reduced past 30-day smoking
among childless non-elderly adults by 6% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states.

12

Young-Wolff et al. (2017) use a pre-post design to provide evidence that cessation medication use increased postexpansion among Medicaid enrollees in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system.

12

Smoking propensities were not altered by the expansion in any other group. Courtemanche et al.
(2017a), using the same data, 13 find no evidence that these expansions affected smoking.
3. Data, variables, and methods
3.1 Prescription medication data
We use the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Database (SDUD). The SDUD is compiled
by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) from administrative data submitted by state
Medicaid programs and include all states’ data for outpatient prescription medications (initial
fills and refills) covered under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for which Medicaid serves as
a third-party payer (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2012). Since 1992, state
Medicaid programs have been required to submit data on the number and type of prescriptions
filled and refilled each quarter to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in
exchange for federal matching funds.
We use data from 2011 to 2015 in our study, and have 20 periods of data for each state:
12 pre-2014 and 8 post-2014. While the SDUD has data from fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid
since 1992, prescription fills and refills obtained through managed care (MC) plans were added
in March, 2010 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2012). We use data from 2011
onward to ensure that we are able to include both FFS and MC data (Wen et al. 2017). 14 The
ability to measure MC data when analyzing the ACA Medicaid expansions is imperative as the
majority of the newly eligible are enrolled in MC plans (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and

13

Simon et al use a differences-in-differences model comparable to the one we estimate while Courtemanche et al
take a third difference based on pre-ACA insurance rates within a local area. We are unable to implement the
Courtemanche et al method in our state-level data that focuses on a single payer (Medicaid).
14
Specifically, we aggregate data from both FFS and MC Medicaid to create a single quarter of data.

13

the Uninsured 2016). We exclude five states – Arizona, Hawaii, Ohio, Rhode Island, and
Virginia – that display odd data patterns. 15
We focus on prescription medications approved by the FDA for cessation (Food and
Drug Administration 2015): Zyban, Chantix, and Nicotrol (an NRT with inhaler and spray
versions). 16 We create these categories using crosswalks between National Drug Codes (NDCs)
for brand name and generics obtained from the National Bureau of Economic Research (Roth
2017). 17 Our main analysis combines all medications, but we also study each medication
separately. There are two main limitations of the SDUD data. (i) They capture aggregate counts
of prescription initial fills and refills, and do not provide information on patient or provider
characteristics. 18 (ii) They do not include rebates by manufacturers to the states.
3.2 Medicaid expansion
Table 1 summarizes our classification of expansion states. The majority of expansion
states implemented their expansion on January 1st, 2014. Two states expanded Medicaid later in
2014 (Michigan and New Hampshire) and five states expanded in 2015 or 2016 (Alaska, Indiana,
Louisiana, Montana, and Pennsylvania) and we refer to these states as ‘late expansion states’.
Prior to 2011, four states (Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont) and the District of
Columbia substantially expanded their Medicaid eligibility to cover both parents and childless
adults with full Medicaid benefits up to 100% FPL or higher and remained open to new

15

Including these five states does not change our results in a meaningful way. Details available on request.
Specific medication classifications that we use to identify these medications are available on request from the
corresponding author. Zyban can be used for multiple purposes including cessation, depression, attention deficit
disorder, obesity, and substance use (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/drugsafety/ucm089835.pdf (accessed
March 31st, 2017). We wish to focus on Zyban that is prescribed to aid cessation. Thus, in our main analyses we
include the following medications: proprietary name Zyban, Buproban, or bupropion, extended release, with the
strength 150mg. In unreported analyses, we have applied more inclusive definitions which, we suspect, include
Zyban prescriptions for other purposes. Results, available on request, are comparable.

Thus we cannot study the number unique prescription users, because some patients may try more than one
medication. However, we are interested in overall changes in service use.

enrollees. The SDUD data are available at the quarter level, and thus we match Medicaid
expansion dates to this dataset based on state-year-quarter. Our classification closely follows
Wherry and Miller (2016), and Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017).
3.3 Outcome variables
We construct the number of prescriptions filled and refilled for all three medications. 19
We construct total payments and Medicaid and non-Medicaid payments, which allows us to test
whether Medicaid or patients financed medications. We convert payments to 2015 dollars using
a healthcare cost Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator (Dunn, Grosse, and Zuvekas 2018).
For each state, we divide each outcome variable by the total population between the ages of 18 to
64 years age (the group most likely to be affected by ACA Medicaid expansions (Simon, Soni,
and Cawley 2017)) of age using data drawn from the American Community Survey (ACS)
(Flood et al. 2017) and the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center (2016). 20
3.4 Control variables
We control for a range of state-level variables in our regressions. First, we merge in
tobacco cigarette and electronic cigarette regulations: taxes and bans on use in public places
(restaurants, bars, and private worksites) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(2016) STATE System. These variables reflect the costs of related goods. We use the tax in
dollars per package of 20 tobacco cigarettes and an indicator for an e-cigarette tax. For public

19

The specific NDCs used for these outcomes are available on request.
We could have standardized our outcomes by the number of Medicaid enrollees. However, we chose not to use
this standardization as the number of enrollees is clearly influenced by a states’ decision to expand Medicaid. Thus,
we would have an endogenous numerator and denominator which complicates interpretation of our regression
coefficients as there would be two changing objects (cessation medications and enrollees).

20

15

use bans, we construct separate variables for tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes that capture the
count of the number of venues in which a state imposes a ban on product use.
Second, we merge in data on state-level demographics from the Annual and Social and
Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS): average age, sex, race, Hispanic
ethnicity, and education. Third, we link the annual seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the
state from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Database and the poverty
rate (University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center 2016) to the SDUD.
Fourth, we control for state social policies targeting lower income populations. To this
end, we turn to the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center (2016) and we
control for the maximum Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefit for a family
of four, the maximum Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit for a family
of four, and the effective state minimum wage (i.e., the higher of the federal or state minimum
wage). We also include an indicator for a Democratic governor; we treat the mayor of the
District of Columbia as the de facto governor of this locality (Maclean and Saloner 2018). We
convert all financial variables to constant 2015 dollars using the above-noted GDP deflator. 21
3.5 Empirical model
Our differences-in-differences model is outlined in Equation (1):
(1)

𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛼𝛼2′ 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + Ω𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the number of prescription fills and refills in state s in period t. 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is an indicator

for whether or not a state has expanded its Medicaid program under the ACA in quarter t. 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is

a vector of state-year level characteristics. 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 and 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 are vectors of state and year-by-quarter

fixed effects. Inclusion of state fixed effects controls for time-invariant state-level unobservable

21

We do not attempt to control for state-year smoking rates, a determinant of demand for smoking cessation,
because smoking rates are plausibly endogenous to the policy we study (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017).

16

factors and implies that our models are identified off within-state variation in Medicaid
expansions. Year-by-quarter fixed effects control for secular trends in cessation medication use
that affect the nation as a whole (e.g., national anti-smoking campaigns) and ACA-related
changes that plausibly apply to all states (e.g., welcome-mat effects). We also include a vector
of state-specific linear time trends (Ω𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ). 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the error term.

We estimate regressions using unweighted OLS and cluster standard errors around the

state (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004). The 46 clusters (after dropping 5 states with
missing data) allow us to consistently estimate standard errors (Cameron and Miller 2015).
3.6 Validity
A necessary assumption for the DD model to recover causal estimates is that the
treatment group (i.e., states with substantial expansions) and the comparison group (i.e., states
without expansions) would follow the same trend in the post-treatment period, had the treatment
states not been treated. However, this assumption is inherently untestable. We instead attempt
to provide suggestive evidence on this assumption in two ways.
(i) We examine unadjusted trends in the pre-treatment period in our outcome variables
for the treatment and comparison groups. If we find that the outcomes appear to trend similarly
in the pre-treatment period across these groups, such trends provide suggestive evidence that the
SDUD data satisfy the parallel trends assumption. (ii) Using only pre-treatment data, we
estimate regression models similar to Equation (1), except that we replace the 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

variable with an interaction between the treatment group (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠 ) and a linear time trend

(𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 ) Akosa Antwi, Moriya, and Simon (2013). The model is presented in Equation (2):
(2)

𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛾𝛾0 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠 ∗ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾2′ 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝜇𝜇𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

17

If we cannot reject the null hypothesis that 𝛾𝛾1 is zero, then this finding provides further support

that our SDUD data can satisfy the parallel trends assumption. In both validity tests, we exclude
states with substantial expansions before 2011.
4. Results
4.1 Summary statistics
Table 2 reports summary statistics for both expansion and non-expansion states in the
period 2011 to 2013. States with substantial expansions before 2011 are excluded from this
comparison. We also report p-values from t-tests assessing the statistical significance of the
differences between the two groups. The annual number of cessation medication prescription
fills and refills per 100,000 non-elderly adults was 250 per quarter in expansion states and 208
per quarter in non-expansion states. While not identical, the two groups of states are generally
similar across observed characteristics. However, there are some notable exceptions. On
average, expansion states had higher tobacco cigarette taxes, more venue-specific smoking bans,
lower poverty rates, and more generous social policies (e.g., higher effective minimum wages)
and were more likely to have a Democrat governor than non-expansion states.
4.2 Validity
Figure 1 provides graphical analysis of trends in cessation prescription medication fills
and refills over our study period. We aggregate the data to the year-treatment level to smooth
out noise. In 2011-2013, prescription fills and refills appear to have moved broadly in parallel in
the expansion and non-expansion states, which supports the hypothesis that the SDUD data
satisfy the parallel trends assumption. However, in 2014-2015, we observe that the expansion
and non-expansion states appeared to follow different trends. Overall, expansion states were
relatively stable in terms of the number of prescription fills and refills reimbursed by Medicaid in

18

the first and second year of the treatment, while non-expansion states appeared to trend
downwards in reimbursed fills and refills in the second year of the treatment.
We report regression-based parallel trends testing in the left-hand panel of Table 3. We
cannot reject the null hypothesis that expansion states and non-expansion states followed similar
trends in prescription fills and refills in 2011-2013: 𝛾𝛾�1 is not statistically different from zero.
Moreover, the estimate of 𝛾𝛾1 are is small and relatively precise, which allows us to rule out

moderate violations of the parallel trends assumption in 2011-2013. In particular, the estimate of
𝛾𝛾1 is 2, relative to a baseline mean of 250, and the standard error estimate is 2.
4.3 Regression results

Table 3 (right-hand panel) reports our main DD results for our outcome variables. Post
expansion, we find that expansion states experienced an increase of 89 prescription fills and
refills per 100,000 non-elderly adults per quarter relative to non-expansion states. Compared to
the baseline mean in expansion states before expansion, this estimate reflects a 36% increase.
We also consider payments – total, Medicaid, and non-Medicaid – for these prescriptions.
As noted earlier in the manuscript, an important limitation of the SDUD is that it does not
include rebates that Medicaid programs receive from pharmaceutical companies. This limitation
is particularly important if expanding Medicaid allowed expansion states to bargain for higher
rebates due to increased market power. However, even given this data limitation, we contend
that this exercise is informative for studying whether Medicaid or patients carried the financial
responsibility for the increase in prescription medications documented in Table 3. 22
Results are reported in Table 4; the top panel reports regression-based testing of the
parallel trends assumption while the bottom panel reports estimates generated in our DD models.

22

For example, we contend that it is unlikely that expanding Medicaid allowed state Medicaid programs to negotiate
rebates from pharmaceutical companies that fully offset payments that we observe in the SDUD.

19

Total payments per quarter on these medications was $15,375 per 100,000 in expansion states.
Medicaid paid the vast majority – 99% in expansion states– of the costs of FDA-approved
smoking cessation medications. The financial responsibility of Medicaid is perhaps not
surprising as the program is characterized by low patient cost-sharing.
Results suggest that the SDUD satisfy the parallel trends assumption: coefficient
estimates in the top panel are small in magnitude and imprecise in the total and Medicaid
payments regressions. We find evidence that non-Medicaid payments were increasing 20112013 in expansion states relative to non-expansion states, thus we are cautious when interpreting
DD results for this outcome. However, we include state-specific linear time trends in our DD
models which can account for some (linear) differences in pre-trends.
Turning to estimates generated in our DD model, we observe that in expansion states
relative to non-expansion states, total payments on these medications per 100,000 per quarter
increased by $4,241, or 28% after the expansion. Estimates for Medicaid payments are similar:
post expansion Medicaid payments rose by $4,295 per 100,000 non-elderly adults per quarter, or
28%, in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. The estimate in the non-Medicaid
payment regression is large in magnitude (-$54) but imprecise. Collectively, our findings from
the SDUD show increased cessation prescription use among the newly insured and that the
newly insured were sheltered from bearing the full financial responsibility of these prescriptions.
There are two somewhat surprising findings generated in our payments analysis. First,
the relative increase in total and Medicaid payments is greater than the relative increase in
prescriptions. However, examination of the lower (upper) tail of the prescription medication
(total/Medicaid payment) 95% confidence interval suggests that the two sets of variables
experienced more analogous changes post-expansion in expanding states relative to non-

20

expanding states. The lower tail of the prescription medication 95% confidence interval suggests
a 21% increase and the upper tail of the total payments 95% confidence interval suggests a 49%
increase. Thus, we cannot rule out the hypothesis that changes in prescriptions and payments
were comparable post-expansion. Second, Medicaid payments increased by $54 more than total
payments. 95% confidence intervals for these estimates overlap, and therefore we cannot rule
out the possibility that total payments increased more than Medicaid payments.
5. Extensions and sensitivity analyses
We estimate several extensions to the main analyses and conduct sensitivity analyses.
5.1 Heterogeneity by medication
The three medications in our analyses vary in how much state Medicaid programs pay
pharmacies – the average cost for Zyban, Chantix, and Nicotrol is $42, $191, and $235,
respectively, per fill or refill in the SDUD during our study period. The medications also have
different efficacy and side effects (Food and Drug Administration 2015). Such differences may
lead to different effects of Medicaid expansion on prescriptions. We next explore heterogeneity
by estimating separate regressions for each medication. Results are reported in Table 5.
Before we proceed to our heterogeneity analysis, we provide suggestive evidence that the
SDUD can satisfy the parallel trends assumption for each cessation medication separately. We
are unable to reject the null hypothesis that the expansion states and non-expansion states
followed the same trend in these outcomes in the pre-expansion period. Turning to our DD
estimates, we find that, post-expansion, Zyban prescription fills and refills increased 40% in
expansion states relative to non-expansion states. We find no statistically significant evidence
that prescription fills or refills for Chantix or Nicotrol increased in expansion states.

21

While our data do not allow us to explore the reasons behind the differential effects by
cessation medication type, there are several possible reasons for this pattern of results. First,
newly eligible smoking patients may be directed, perhaps through the use of differential copayments or other forms of utilization management, toward less costly medications (Zyban) and
away from more expensive medications (Chantix and Nictorol). Given the clinical literature
does not suggest that these medications differ substantially in terms of their efficacy, this pattern
of results could imply that the newly eligible are being treated in a cost-effective manner.
Second, despite our efforts to focus on Zyban for smoking cessation rather than bupropion for
depression, it is possible that some of the increase in our Zyban measure reflects it is use as an
antidepressant (Maclean et al. 2017). Other possibilities include patient preferences, provider
preferences for, or knowledge of, medications, or some other factor.
5.2 Event study
We estimate an event study to explore the possibility of policy endogeneity (Autor 2003).
More specifically, we augment Equation (1) with a series interactions between period indicators
for Q1 2011 through Q4 2015, and an indicator for expansion states (policy leads and lags). Q4
2013 is the omitted period in the event study. We omit the state-specific linear time trends
following Wolfers (2006). We exclude states with substantial expansions before 2011.
We report event study results graphically in Figure 2; specific coefficient and standard
error estimates are reported in Appendix Table 1. The event study findings are in line with
estimates generated in the DD regression models. The coefficient estimates are small in
magnitude and generally imprecise (95% confidence intervals include zero) before 2014.
Coefficients become positive and precise in Q1 2014, and increase in magnitude over time. The
increasing effect sizes in the post-period are in line with the hypothesis that patients are better

22

able to access services over time, perhaps as they become aware of their benefits and/or are able
to navigate the healthcare delivery system (e.g., enroll in Medicaid, locate a physician, schedule
an appointment, and fill a prescription). 23 These increasing effect sizes over time suggests that
cessation will also increases as time passes. Given that the ACA Medicaid literature on smoking
effects is decidedly mixed (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017, Courtemanche et al. 2017a), our
findings for a mechanism through which insurance may affect smoking is informative.
5.3 Weighting
There is controversy as to whether weighting is appropriate in studies that seek to
estimate causal effects (Angrist and Pischke 2009, Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge 2015). Given
this controversy, we re-estimate Equation (1) using population weights; we weight the
regressions with the population ages 18 to 64 in each state. Results are reported in Table 6 and
are not appreciably different from the unweighted results generated in our core model (Table 3).
5.4 Counselling services and over-the-counter cessation medications
Over time states have increasingly covered smoking cessation counseling (Singleterry et
al. 2014); which may change the use of cessation medications, either by substituting for or
encouraging medication adherence. Moreover, Medicaid expansion plans include coverage for
OTC FDA-approved NRTs. Thus, our analysis may be vulnerable to omitted variable bias as we
do not control for these related covered services.
We re-estimate Equation (1) including an indicator variable for whether a state-yearquarter covers counselling services (individual or group) or at least one FDA-approved OTC

23

We note that another common concern in policy analyses is program induced migration. That is, some individuals
may migrate from non-expansion states to expansion states and such behavior will bias regression coefficients
(Moffitt 1992). To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence that the ACA Medicaid expansions induced this
type of cross-state migration behavior (Goodman 2017).

23

NRT (nicotine gum, lozenge, or patch). Table 7 reports results: coefficient estimates are not
appreciably different from our core findings (Table 3).
To dig deeper into the importance of OTC NRTs, we re-estimate Equation (1) using the
above-noted FDA-approved OTC NRTs as variables analogous to our prescription medication
variables. 24 We examine common OTC NRTs (e.g., Nicoderm, Nicorette, generic brands for
national box stores such as Walmart’s brand Equate) using the method outlined in Section 3.1.
Results are reported in Table 8. We also report regression-based testing of the parallel trends
assumption in the left-hand panel of Table 8; this analysis suggests that the OTC data are able to
satisfy this assumption. Turning to our DD estimates (right-hand panel), we find no statistically
significant evidence that OTC NRT prescriptions fills and refills increased post expansion.
It is surprising that we find increases in prescription medications but no corresponding
increases in the OTC NRTs post-expansion. We propose possible reasons. (i) OTC NRTs tend
to be less expensive than prescription medications and OTC NRTs may be more affordable to
uninsured smokers seeking to quit, but when prescription medication out-of-pocket prices
decline with Medicaid coverage smokers switch to the latter, more expensive, product. 25 (ii)
Many states offered OTC NRTs for free or at a heavy discount pre-ACA (Cummins et al. 2007)
and uninsured smokers may have relied on these discounts pre-expansion and may continue to
obtain NRTs outside Medicaid. (iii) The clinical literature suggests that prescription medications
are more efficacious than OTC NRTs, thus newly insured smokers (perhaps in combination with
healthcare providers) wishing to quit their smoking addiction may simply be selecting the

24

Medicaid programs typically require a prescription for OTC NRTs, hence we are able to study these medications
in the SDUD. For example, see the New York (https://www.nysmokefree.com/subpage.aspx?pn=medications;
accessed August 21st 2017) and Mississippi (https://medicaid.ms.gov/wpcontent/uploads/2014/04/OTClistforWebEffective-10-1-2013.pdf; accessed August 21st, 2017) Medicaid plan
documentation relating to OTC NRT coverage.

24

optimal cessation method post-expansion. (iv) Coefficient estimates in Table 8 are positive
while the standard error estimates are relatively large, thus we cannot definitively rule out the
hypothesis that OTC NRT prescriptions increased post-expansion.
5.5 Utilization management techniques
The ACA did not regulate state Medicaid program use of utilization management
techniques. According to the CDC (2016), the most common forms of utilization management
are copayments, annual duration limits, and prior authorization. There is concern among
healthcare scholars that such techniques may offset expansion effects (McAfee et al. 2015). To
explore this possibility, we estimate a variant of Equation (1) that includes an indicator that takes
on a value of one if the state applies one of the above-noted utilization management techniques,
and zero otherwise. Results (Table 9) are not appreciably different from our core findings (Table
3), and suggest that utilization management techniques do not offset expansion effects. 26,27
5.6 Primary care
A concern among policy makers is that, post-expansion, the newly eligible will not be
able to access primary care given difficulties, pre-ACA, faced by Medicaid patients in accessing
this type of care (Decker 2012). To explore the importance of access to primary care, where
many of the prescriptions that we study here likely originate, we next estimate separate
regressions for states with relatively high and relatively low access to primary care.
We combine data from the Area Resource File (ARF) on the number of physicians
delivering primary care and data from CMS on the number of Medicaid enrollees in each state to

26

In unreported analyses we have used different coding schemes for utilization management and the results, which
are available on request, are not appreciably different.
27
Using data from the CDC STATE system, we have explored the extent to which expansion states have complied
with the ACA cessation medication regulation that, post January 1st 2014, Medicaid must cover all three medications
that we study here. Overall, states appear to be broadly in compliance with this requirement. However, we did find
evidence that several states were not fully compliant (i.e., did not cover all medications). In unreported analyses, we
excluded non-compliant states from the analysis sample. Results are robust and are available on request.

25

construct the ratio of physicians who might be delivering patient care to Medicaid enrollees. We
classify states as ‘high access’ (at or above the median value of the primary physician-Medicaid
enrollee ratio for the nation) or ‘low access’ (below the median value of the primary physicianMedicaid enrollee ratio for the nation). We use ARF and CMS data from 2010, in advance of the
Medicaid expansions we study, to avoid stratifying the sample based on an endogenous variable
(i.e., the number of enrollees). 28 Results are reported in Table 10.
We find similar effects (i.e., when comparing coefficient estimates to the pre-expansion
means) in the low access sample than the high access sample. This is in line with Abdus and Hill
(2017) who find no evidence of negative spillovers of the expansions on insured populations.
5.7 Isolating effects for the newly eligible
A limitation of the SDUD data, similar to many survey and administrative datasets used
to study ACA Medicaid expansions, is that the data do not include information on patients to
allow separation of the newly eligible from other Medicaid enrollees. We explore effects in
different specifications and samples to tease out effects among newly eligible enrollees. Each of
these extensions is subject to important limitations, which we outline below. We argue that
considering results generated in these extensions collectively is informative for thinking through
the extent to which we can interpret our main estimates (Table 3) as reflecting effects for the
newly eligible or some combination of groups that enrolled in Medicaid due to ACA-related
changes; i.e., newly eligible populations, previously eligible populations that enrolled in
Medicaid due to welcome mat effects, and populations that become eligible for Medicaid due to
changes in the income disregard.

28

We note that the number of physicians is also potentially endogenous to the expansions we study. Indeed, the
ACA allocated resources toward increasing healthcare workforce and infrastructure (Abdus and Hill 2017).

26

Our first approach to minimize contamination from welcome-mat and income disregard
effects is to estimate a triple-difference style estimator to isolate effects for the newly eligible.
We augment Equation (1) with a three-way interaction between an indicator for the expansion
period, the post period (this varies across states depending on when the state expanded
Medicaid), and the newly eligible as a percent of increased enrollment. We define the newly
eligible share of increased enrollment between 2013 and each period in the following manner:
(3)

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇

𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 −𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠,2013

∗ 100%

Where 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the number of newly eligible enrollees in state s in period t, 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the total

number of enrollees in state s in time t, and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠,2013 is the total number of enrollees in state s
in 2013. This variable is coded as zero in all years prior to expansion for expansion states and

for non-expansion states in all periods. We constrain 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 to lie between 0% and 100% in
all years. 29 We exclude early expanding states from this analysis. 30 The Medicaid expansion
indicator captures the effect of Medicaid expansion on all Medicaid enrollees other than the
newly eligible (welcome mat and income disregard) and the three-way interaction captures the
effect for the newly eligible. We do not include the main effect for 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 as it is collinear

with other variables in the regression. A limitation of this analysis is that the 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 variable
is likely influenced by Medicaid expansion, hence results generated in this specification may be
vulnerable to over-controlling bias (Angrist and Pischke 2009). We report results in Table 11.

We set 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 to zero for a few states that had declines in total enrollment, perhaps due to the improving
economy over the study period. We capped 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 at 100%, because, in readily available CMS enrollment
summaries, early expansion enrollees were reclassified in 2014 as ‘newly eligible,’ making it appear as though the
newly eligible grew more than total enrollment.
30
Including these states in the analysis does not alter our results appreciably (results available on request). We
chose to exclude these variables as they did enroll newly eligible prior to January 1st, 2014 but our data source for
enrollees (CMS) began tracking enrollment by newly eligible status in January 1st, 2014.
29

27

The interaction between the expansion indicator and post is not statistically different from
zero in this specification; the confidence interval is quite wide and thus we cannot rule out
increases in prescriptions for the non-newly eligible Medicaid populations. However, the
coefficient on the three-way interaction is positive and precise. To interpret this coefficient
estimate, we multiply it by the mean value of 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 in the post-period among expansion

states (82.85%). We find that, post-expansion, prescriptions among newly eligible populations
increased by 90 per 100,000 non-elderly residents each quarter (36%). This estimate is very
similar to that estimated in our main specification (Table 3; an increase of 89 prescriptions per
quarter or 36%). We interpret these results to suggest that our findings are primarily attributable
to increases in prescriptions among the newly eligible. This pattern is in line with findings for
primary care visits (Biener, Zuvekas, and Hill 2017), a setting in which cessation medication
prescriptions are likely to be written. The authors show that, post-expansion, primary care visits
increased among newly-eligibles but such visits were not altered among previously eligibles.
As a second approach, we re-estimate Equation (1) in for prescriptions financed by MC
plans and FFS Medicaid plans separately. Interviews with state Medicaid program directors
reveal that most newly eligibles are enrolled in MC plans while traditional populations are more
likely to be enrolled in FFS plans (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2016).
We argue that separating the data in this manner can allow us to provide estimates for samples
that better reflect the newly eligible and other populations that enrolled in Medicaid. A
limitation of this extension is that there is not a perfect correlation between newly eligible
enrollees and Medicaid plan (MC vs. FFS); i.e., there are obviously newly eligibles enrolled in
FFS plans, and previously eligibles and individuals who became eligible due to changes in the
income disregard enrolled in MC plans. We are simply relying on the fact that the newly

28

eligibles are much more likely to enroll in MC plans based on reports by state Medicaid program
directors. For the analysis of MC plans we include only those state/year pairs that have MC data
appearing in the SDUD (not all states have MC programs in all years of our study period) and we
exclude the four expansion states that do not use MC for newly eligibles during our study period
(Arkansas, Connecticut, Montana, and Vermont).
Results are reported in Table 12. The MC sample produces an estimate very similar to
our main estimates although relative effect size is larger (Table 3). In particular, post-expansion,
the number of quarterly prescription fills and refills in MC plans increased by 62 (55%) in
expansion states relative to non-expansion states. 31 In terms of the FFS sample, we find no
statistically significant evidence that prescriptions financed by FFS Medicaid increased in
expanding states relative to non-expansion states. The effect size (both absolute and relative) is
smaller in the FFS sample than the MC sample. We interpret these findings to suggest that our
main DD estimates primarily capture effects for the newly eligible and not other groups that
enrolled in Medicaid due to ACA-related changes.
Finally, we attempt to remove effects attributable those enrollees who became eligible
due to the five percentage point increase in the income thresholds for both expansion and nonexpansion states. This policy change occurred January 1st, 2014 for all states. Hence, for states
that expanded Medicaid on January 1st, 2014, Medicaid expansion and the income disregard
increase are perfectly collinear. To separate these two effects, we re-estimate Equation (1)
excluding all states that expanded January 1st, 2014 and early expansion states (see Table 1). We
exclude the early expansion states as, while these states did have major Medicaid expansions
prior to the ACA-related expansions we study, the ACA expansion substantially increased the

31

The relative effect size is larger as the baseline number of prescription fills and refills is lower in the MC
Medicaid-financed sample than in the overall sample of prescriptions.

29

number of individuals eligible for Medicaid. Excluding these states allows us to recover effects
for the newly eligible from effects for those individuals who became eligible due to the income
disregard. However, an important limitation of this approach is that we leverage variation from
the relatively small number of late expanding states (see Table 1). We interpret findings from
this analysis cautiously, and encourage readers to do the same, as the findings could be
attributable to unique attributes of the late expanding states rather than Medicaid expansion.
Results from this analysis are reported in Table 13. The estimated effects suggest that,
post-expansion, quarterly prescription medications increased by 53 per 100,000 non-elderly
adults in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. The 95% confidence intervals for this
point estimate and our main point estimate (Table 3; 89) overlap. We interpret the similarity in
the point estimates to imply that our main findings are largely attributable to the newly eligible.
In summary, while our data (administrative prescription counts) do not allow us to isolate
those patients who became eligible due to the Medicaid expansions, findings from estimates
generated in different specifications and samples collectively suggests that our estimates are not
fully attributable to groups other than the newly eligible. These methods could be applied in
other data sets that lack detailed income and demographic information.
5.8 States with no change in cessation medication coverage
The ACA required that all states cover FDA-approved smoking cessation medications.
For states that did not cover these services prior to this Act, continuously enrolled traditional
Medicaid populations in expansion and non-expansion states gained coverage. Thus, our DD
estimates may reflect the combined effects of Medicaid expansion to newly eligible enrollees
and cessation service coverage gains among the continuously enrolled. To isolate newly eligible
effects we estimate Equation (1) excluding states that changed coverage for any of the

30

medications we examine during our study period using data from Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (2016). 32
Results are reported in Table 14. Estimates generated in this sample are very similar to
our main results (Table 3): post expansion, quarterly prescription fills and refills increase by 72
per 100,000 or 28% in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. We interpret these
results to suggest that our findings are primarily attributable to increases in enrollment, rather
than improvements in coverage.
5.9 Controlling for between-state heterogeneity
In our primary specification, we control for between-state heterogeneity through the
inclusion of time-varying state-level variables, states fixed effects, and state-specific linear time
trends. While this specification is standard in policy analyses (Angrist and Pischke 2009), it
does impose assumptions on the nature of between-state heterogeneity. For example, statespecific linear time trends can account for state-level unobservables that vary in a linear manner
over time but the true trends in such unobservables may not be linear. On the other hand, if there
are no important time-varying state-level variables, including these time trends ‘throws away’
variation that can be used for identification of treatment effects. Further, some of our timevarying state-level controls may be outcomes of Medicaid expansion, suggesting that our
estimates suffer from over-controlling bias (Angrist and Pischke 2009).
To explore the robustness of our findings to different specifications, we next estimate
variants of Equation (1) that sequentially exclude state-specific linear time trends, exclude timevarying state-level controls, and include state-specific quadratic time trends. Results are reported
in Table 15 and are in line with estimates generated in our main specification. Indeed, 95%

32

confidence intervals of all point estimates in Table 15 include the point estimate generated in our
primary specification (Table 3, 89). Not surprisingly, coefficients are generally smaller in
specifications that offer more control for between-state heterogeneity.
5.10 Alternative coding of ACA-related Medicaid expansion
We next report the robustness of our results to alternative approaches to coding ACArelated Medicaid expansion. First, we adopt the coding of early expansion states in Sommers et
al. (2013) and Maclean and Saloner (2017); second we code states with substantial Medicaid
prior to our study period (early expansion states in Table 1) as expanding January 1st, 2014 in the
spirit of Courtemanche et al. (2017b); third we exclude states with substantial Medicaid
expansions prior to our study period from the analysis sample following sensitivity analyses
outlined by Wherry and Miller (2016), and Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017); 33 and fourth we
exclude California as this state has the largest number of Medicaid enrollees (University of
Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center 2016) and we wish to ensure that our findings are
not driven by one specific state. Results are reported in Table 16. While the point estimates do
vary across the various coding schemes, 95% confidence intervals for all specifications include
our primary point estimate (89; Table 3) and we interpret these findings to imply that our results
are not sensitive to the use of different approaches to coding ACA-related Medicaid expansion.
6. Discussion
In this study we offer new evidence on the effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
Medicaid expansions, specifically we examine the use of prescription medications for smoking
cessation. The ACA-related expansions increased Medicaid enrollment by 27% (Gates et al.

33

This check excludes Massachusetts, which implemented a large-scale healthcare reform in 2006 that shares
similarities with the ACA (Gruber 2008) and included smoking-cessation medications coverage for Medicaid
enrollees (Land et al. 2010). Thus, we also explore the possibility that our main point estimates are partially driven
by a previous large-scale healthcare reform.

32

2016), and 38% of this population may smoke (DiGiulio et al. 2016). The expansions were
therefore targeted at a group of adults with a high rate of uninsurance and smoking risk, and
included a generous set of cessation medications. Our findings imply that, post-expansion,
cessation medication fills and refills for which Medicaid was a third-party payer increased 36%
in expansion states relative to non-expansion states, and this change was primarily driven by
increased prescriptions for Zyban. Zyban is the least expensive prescription medication we
study, which suggests that the newly eligible were being treated in a cost-effective manner, as
the medications we study have similar efficacy. We provide evidence that this estimate is
predominately driven by the newly eligible population and not other groups that enrolled in
Medicaid with the broader ACA roll-out, nor improvements in coverage of prescription cessation
products among populations continuously enrolled Medicaid over our study period (2011-2015).
Increased prescriptions were financed by state Medicaid programs and not patients. Dynamic
models suggest that prescriptions increased over time. Finally, and re-assumingly, our estimates
are stable across numerous sensitivity checks.
We can compare our findings with previous ACA Medicaid studies that examine
smoking. While Simon, Soni, and Cawley (2017) provide evidence that ACA Medicaid
expansions reduced smoking by 6% among childless adults, Courtemanche et al. (2017a) find no
evidence that smoking declined post-expansion among childless adults or any other population.
Given that the effect of ACA Medicaid expansions on smoking remains unsettled, our study of
cessation medications is particularly timely and offers new evidence on this question. Cessation
takes time with the average smoker attempting to quit roughly 30 times before obtaining
abstinence (Chaiton et al. 2016). If increased use of prescription medications is a principle
mechanism through which expansions affect smoking, then – prior to changes in smoking – we

33

would expect to see changes in medications. Given that we document increases in cessation
medication fills and refills that accelerated over time, our findings suggest that we may expect
more definitive evidence that smoking has declined in expansion states as more post-expansion
data becomes available. Thus, our use of prescriptions facilitates better understanding of the
mechanisms related to ACA Medicaid expansions and behavioral response of lower income
smokers with little experience with the healthcare delivery system who seek to quit their
smoking addiction. Finally, regardless of whether or not ACA Medicaid expansions affect
smoking in the short- or long-run, assessing the effects of these expansions on service use is
critical for understanding the overall value of this major policy shift.
We can also compare our estimates to three recent studies that have explored the effect of
Medicaid expansion on prescription medication claims. Our finding of a 36% increase in
Medicaid-financed smoking cessation medications is in the middle of estimates for the effect of
the Medicaid expansion on prescription medications in general and specific types of prescription
medications related to treatment of behavioral health outcomes. Our finding is larger than an
increase of 19% found for all Medicaid-financed prescriptions (Ghosh, Simon, and Sommers
2017) and an increase of 22% identified for psychotropic medications (Maclean et al. 2017), but
less than a 70% increase found for prescription drugs used to treat opioid use disorders (Wen et
al. 2017). Our estimate is comparable to a 43% increase found for all FDA-approved
medications used to treat alcohol and drug use disorders (Maclean and Saloner 2017).
Although several studies suggest Medicaid expansions have led to reductions in
uninsurance, increased healthcare access and service use, improved health, and reduced financial
instability (Miller and Wherry 2017, Wherry and Miller 2016, Hu et al. 2016, Simon, Soni, and
Cawley 2017), the future direction of Medicaid is uncertain. Our study suggests that

34

constraining Medicaid eligibility for the populations that gained access through the ACA-related
expansions may reduce the use of smoking cessation medications. Reducing the use of such
medications may in turn increase the total economic costs of smoking, currently estimated at
$300B annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017).
In summary, our findings offer new evidence on the early effects of Medicaid expansions
on smokers. In combination with previous analyses that have explored the effects of expansions
on other behavioral health outcomes, Medicaid expansions appear to have been associated with
increased access to evidence-based services to a particularly policy-relevant group: low-income
Americans who suffer from tobacco use, a chronic, addictive, costly, and harmful condition.
