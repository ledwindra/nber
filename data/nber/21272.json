    "abstract": "\n\nWe conduct a field experiment designed to test theories of time-inconsistency, namely a \"Beta-Delta\" model of present bias. The experiment takes place in the context of a saving decision made by low-income tax filers who can deposit their income tax refund into an illiquid account. We find qualitative evidence consistent with present-biased preferences. The tradeoff between an earlier payment or a later one is much more skewed toward taking the early payment when the decision is made on the spot than when the decision is made in advance. We estimate a \u03b2 and \u03b4 of 0.34 and 1.08 over an 8-month horizon, respectively, which translates into an annual discount rate of 164%.\n\n",
