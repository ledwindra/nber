Teaching, Teachers Pensions and Retirement across Recent Cohorts of College Graduate Women
Maria D. Fitzpatrick
NBER Working Paper No. 22698
September 2016
JEL No. H55,J2
ABSTRACT
Labor force participation rates of college-educated women ages 60 to 64 increased by 20 percent
(10 percentage points) between 2000 and 2010. One potential explanation for this change stems
from the fact that fewer college-educated women in the more recent cohorts were ever teachers.
This occupational shift could affect the length of women’s careers because teaching is a
profession where workers are covered by defined benefit pensions and, generally, defined benefit
pensions allow workers to retire earlier than Social Security. I provide evidence supporting the
hypothesis and show that older college-educated women who worked as teachers do not
experience increases in labor force participation as large as their counterparts who never taught.

Introduction
Labor force participation rates of college-educated women ages 60 to 64 increased by 20

percent (10 percentage points) between 2000 and 2010. One potential explanation for this
change stems from the fact that a lower proportion of the college-educated women in the more
recent cohorts were ever teachers. The propensity of women to obtain a college degree increased
by a factor of 5 between the 1925 and 1950 birth cohorts (from 5 to 25 percentage points). Since
the number of female teachers remained relatively constant during the period, the fraction of
college-educated women who were teachers fell precipitously.
This occupational shift among college-educated women could drive the recent increases
in labor force participation for any number of reasons. For example, if teaching is more stressful
than the other occupations that college-educated women are now more likely to be employed in,
then the more recent cohorts of college-educated women will retire at older ages than previous
cohorts. Alternatively, if teachers are more likely than other college-educated women to be
secondary earners, they may retire earlier either because they are not the primary earner or in
order to time retirement with an older spouse.
In this chapter, I examine a third potential difference between teachers and workers in
other occupations: pension eligibility (and wealth). Public school teachers are almost universally
covered by defined benefit pensions and, generally, defined benefit pensions allow workers to
retire at earlier ages than Social Security. Therefore, as the fraction of college-educated women
without access to these defined benefit pensions increased, the labor supply of older collegeeducated women increased. I provide evidence supporting the hypothesis in part by showing that
older college-educated women who ever worked as teachers do not experience increases in labor
force participation as large as their counterparts who never taught.

II.

The Changing Nature of College-Educated Women’s Occupations
At various moments during the last hundred years, women made enormous strides in their

educational attainment. In Figure 1, I use data from Godin and Katz (2008) to plot college
graduation rates (by age 30) of women by birth cohort. Focusing on the cohorts most relevant
for this study, in the 1925 cohort the female graduation rate starts around 5 percent and begins to
climb. By the 1940 cohort, female graduation rates had more than doubled and by the 1950
cohort they doubled again, reaching nearly 25 percent.
As more women graduated from college, they also began to be employed in a more
diverse set of occupations. In Figure 2, I plot the fraction of employed college-educated women
in the Current Population Survey (CPS) between the ages of 46 and 50 who report being a
teacher, by birth cohort. 1 The fraction of teachers decreases from around 40 percent for the
cohorts born before 1940 to 30 percent for those born in 1950 and decreases further still to just
15 percent for the cohorts born after 1959. The shift in occupational choice may have
implications for the labor supply of older women because, as described next, teachers, who are
mostly public employees, have access to pensions that are different than those in other sectors.
III.

Pensions

A. A Brief History of Teacher Pensions
Although the first statewide systems of teacher pensions in the U.S. were introduced in
the last quarter of the nineteenth century, very few were in place before 1910 (Clark et al. 2003).

1

The Current Population Survey only collects information about occupation and industry of those who
report being employed. The fraction of college-educated women who are employed between the ages of
46 and 50 across the cohorts born between 1920 and 1965 varies little. Restricting to women ages 46 to
50 allows me to create a time-series for cohorts as far back as 1920. The fraction of college-educated
women who are employed and report being teachers by cohort is similar when measured at earlier ages.
-3-

At that time, Social Security did not exist and teaching was an occupation largely reserved for
unmarried women. Those who remained in teaching for many years were those who had never
married and therefore could not rely on a spouse's income for retirement support. 2 As such,
teacher pension systems were seen as a mechanism to provide assistance to women who might
not otherwise have late-in-life support. During the early part of the twentieth century the use of
pensions expanded until, by the late 1920s, teachers in 28 states were covered by pensions. 3 By
2013, public school teachers in all states participated in publicly-funded pension plans.
Pensions generally take one of two forms: defined benefit or defined contribution. In a
traditional defined benefit pension plan, upon retirement the employee receives a set benefit for
life. The benefit size is determined by age, time spent with the employer and earnings history
while employed, and is usually adjusted to account for inflation. In 2013, teachers in 44 states
participated in either a traditional (39 states) or hybrid (five states) defined benefit pension
system. In a defined contribution pension plan, employer and employee contributions are made
throughout the employee’s tenure. The firm and the employees choose among investment
options for the contributions. In 2013, only one state, Alaska, offered teachers only a defined
contribution plan. 4 In the remaining five states, public school teachers had a choice of
participating in a defined benefit plan, defined contribution plan or some combination.
Therefore, an overwhelming majority of public school teachers in the U.S. participate in
some form of defined benefit pension program. It is important to note that the current widespread

2

Many districts had marriage bars that banned married women from working. For more information, see
Goldin (1991a, 1991b, 2006).
3
In contrast to the pension systems available to most policemen and firefighters at the time, which were
operated by municipalities, most teachers participated in statewide pension plans.
4
Even Alaska’s defined contribution plan is sufficiently new that teachers in the cohorts relevant for this
study participate in the preexisting defined benefit plan.
-4-

use of defined benefit pensions is unique to employers in the public sector. In 2006, 65 percent
of older workers in the public sector participated in some form of defined benefit plan, while
only 39 percent of private sector workers did (Gustman et al. 2010). Moreover, while only 22
percent of private sector workers participate only in a defined benefit plan, the same is true of 57
percent of public sector workers. 5
Although relatively few people in the private sector have access to a defined benefit
pension, nearly all private sector workers are covered by Social Security, which is itself a type of
defined benefit pension. Teachers in many states also participate in Social Security, although
that was not always the case. Starting in 1954, the Social Security Act was amended to allow
state and local government employees who were members of a public retirement system to
participate in the Social Security program. Since then, public employees have been able to gain
membership in Social Security by majority vote of the employees. Such votes have been passed
in 35 states and all teachers in these states participate in Social Security. In another three states
teachers in some districts participate in Social Security. Estimates suggest that between 61 and
73 percent of teachers currently participate in Social Security (Doherty et al. 2012).
B. The Structure of Teacher Pensions
Why might the type of pension plan influence labor supply at older ages? A notable
characteristic of defined benefit pension plans is defined rules governing eligibility for benefit
collection and benefit size. In addition to plan rules being clearly delineated, the rules are often
structured such that the monetary gain for the employee of continued employment past a certain

5

The shift towards defined contribution plans in the private sector began in the 1980s. Potential causes
include the introduction of 401(k) defined contribution plans, a shift in private sector employment away
from heavily unionized industries, and the increased funding requirements for private sector pension
plans.
-5-

point is negative. These rules often lead to large discrete changes in the present discounted value
of income to employees of retiring at a particular age or year of tenure. This feature is in stark
contrast to defined contribution pensions where an employee can begin collecting benefits at
almost any time and the present value of the pension wealth increases steadily with contributions
(and oscillates only with market fluctuations). 6 Because there are no large eligibility-ruleinduced discrete changes in the present value of defined contribution pension accounts at specific
ages or levels of experience, there are no clear incentives to retire at a particular age or level of
experience.
However, even employees in the U.S. without defined benefit pensions from their
employer still participate in Social Security. The earliest age of retirement in Social Security is
62 and the full retirement age ranges from 65 to 67 depending on the individual’s year of birth.
As with any defined benefit pension system, Social Security eligibility ages are influential in the
decision making of older Americans. About 40 percent of Social Security recipients begin
collecting benefits at age 62 and another 10 percent begin collection at the full retirement age. 7
At issue is how these incentives to retire at certain ages in Social Security compare with those in
the defined benefit pensions provided to public school teachers.
Rules regarding eligibility for benefit collection in defined benefit pension plans for
teachers are based on age, years of service within the public school retirement system, or some
combination thereof. For example, in California, teachers who have vested in the system can
retire at age 55. Teachers in the New York State pension system may retire with 35 years of

6

In 401k plans there is a 10 percent increase in present value of pension wealth when a worker hits age
55 and retires, at which point she avoids the early withdrawal penalty. If the worker retires before 55 or
converts the 401k into an IRA, she must wait until age 59.5 to avoid the early withdrawal penalty.
7
Based on my calculations using data on claiming from the Social Security Administration.

service regardless of their age. 8 Still many other states use the combination of age and years of
service. For example, in the Texas Teachers’ Retirement System, eligibility is determined by the
rule of 80: any combination of age and years of service totaling at least 80 makes someone
eligible to begin collecting retirement benefits as long as the employee is at least age 60. 9
As illustrated in the examples of these three states, traditionally, eligibility rules in public
sector defined benefit pensions have been structured such that employees can retire much earlier
than they would be eligible in the Social Security system. In Figure 3, I present information on
the earliest age at which a continuously-employed teacher who started working at age 22
becomes eligible for an unreduced retirement benefit, known as the normal retirement benefit.
The figure shows that the age of retirement eligibility for career teachers ranges from 47 to 67.
The bulk of states (35) have retirement eligibility ages between 52 and 60. Recall that the first
age at which Americans are eligible for normal benefit collection in Social Security is 65. In
comparison, only three state systems have pension eligibility rules for career teachers that would
preclude them from collecting their full pension benefits by age 65.
What makes the comparison more remarkable is that the information in Figure 3 is about
teachers’ eligibility for a normal retirement benefit. Teachers in many state pension systems can
retire even earlier if they are willing to accept a reduction in their annual benefit. 10 The size of

8

Tier I members (those that started before 1973) of the New York State Teachers’ Retirement System can
begin collecting benefits with 35 years of service at any age. They can also collect benefits at age 55 with
at least five years of service. The rules have changed over time and teachers entering New York state
public schools since 2010 are eligible to receive benefits at age 55 with ten years of service.

9
If she entered the Texas Teacher Retirement System for the first time after 2014, the member must have
at least 80 years of combined age and experience and be at least 62.
10
For example, if a teacher in Texas satisfies the rule of 80 requirement, but is not yet 60 years of age, she
can retire, but her benefit will be reduced by five percent for each year she is younger than age 60. In
other words, the Texas teacher who started teaching at age 22 and worked continuously is eligible for a
normal retirement benefit at age 60. She can retire at age 51 (with 29 years of service) with a benefit that
-7-

the reduction is based on how early the worker claims benefits, known as an early retirement
option or early retirement benefit. Almost all state pensions systems (46) have an early
retirement option for teachers. The option is similar to the early retirement option in Social
Security, where benefit collection can start at age 62 with a reduction in the size of the benefit. I
do not know of any source that has carefully cataloged the early retirement ages in teacher
pension systems. However, since only 11 states have full retirement ages that are higher than the
early retirement age in Social Security, it is safe to say that the vast majority of teachers can
collect early retirement benefits at a younger age than Social Security participants.
In addition to eligibility rules that allow earlier retirement in teaching than other
occupations, there is another dimension of defined benefit pensions that encourages retirement at
relatively young ages. In many states there is a maximum allowed benefit. For example, in
Illinois, the maximum benefit payable to a retiree is 75 percent of her final average salary, which
is similar in size to the maximum benefit in other states. The annual benefit amount in a defined
benefit plan is generally determined by years of service and some measure of final average
salary. To be specific, the annual annuity, B, is defined by the formula:
𝐵 = 𝐹 × Years of Service × Final Average Salary

where F is known as the benefit factor. Benefit factors for are generally around 2 percent or more
per year of service. Given these benefit factors, career teachers often reach the maximum benefit
point within 30 to 35 years of service, or in their mid-fifties to early-sixties. After reaching the
maximum benefit point, the return to continued work decreases precipitously because benefits no
longer accrue at 2 percent per year.

is just 55 percent of what her normal benefit would have been, at 52 with a benefit 60 percent as large,
and so on.
-8-

The combination of these eligibility and benefit rules set up changes in accrued pension
wealth that lead to clear incentives to retire at certain points. The present value of benefits
increases sharply when a worker becomes eligible for early retirement making early retirement
eligibility a salient moment for teacher retirement. Pension wealth then continues increasing at a
relatively fast rate (as compared to earlier in one’s career) until the teacher hits the normal
retirement age. At that point, the present value of pension wealth may still increase with time on
the job, but it will do so at a slower rate than it did between early and normal retirement
eligibility. Eventually, when the employee hits the point where she will receive the maximum
benefit, her pension wealth accrual with an additional year of employment actually begins
decreasing. This odd change occurs because, despite the increase in the salary used to calculate
benefits, by continuing employment she forgoes some of the benefit payments entitled to her if
she retired.
The large effect of these rules on teacher retirement behavior has been well-documented
in the literature. For example, Harris and Adams (2007) calculated that nationally, in 2005, 54
percent of the teachers first reaching early retirement eligibility took that option. Another threequarters of teachers who reach normal retirement age began collecting benefits at that point.
Therefore, nearly 90 percent of career teachers have retired by the normal retirement age in
teaching, which, as I described, is at an earlier age in most states than the early retirement age in
Social Security. Other researchers show that pension eligibility leads to similar increases in
retirement using state administrative data (Brown 2013; Koedel et al. 2014; Mahler 2014). For
example, in Missouri, the median retirement age is 57 (Koedel et al. 2014).
Finally, in addition to pensions, there is one other notable piece of retirement-related
compensation available for former public school teachers (and other public sector workers) that

-9-

is not as widely available for workers in the private sector: retiree health insurance. As of 2009,
every state offered some form of retiree health insurance to its government employees, including
teachers (Clark and Morrill 2010). These state-sponsored retiree health insurance programs
provide subsidized health insurance to teachers collecting benefits from the state pension system.
Therefore, these employees have access to health insurance that is not contingent on employment
at younger ages than most people can receive it from the federal government (generally at age
65, through Medicare). Research has shown that the offer of retiree health insurance leads public
school teachers to retire earlier than they would have otherwise (Fitzpatrick 2014).
IV.

Evidence from the Health and Retirement Study

A. Employment, Retirement, and Benefit Collection
The existing literature clearly illustrates that teachers leave their main jobs as public school
teachers when they reach retirement eligibility. While informative, the fact does not provide a
rich understanding of the labor supply of female teachers and how it compares with other
college-educated women. This is, in part, because teachers can continue to work even after
collecting retirement benefits from their pension system. Most existing research on teacher
retirement uses administrative data from teacher pension systems. Although such data offer large
sample sizes, they do not include information on labor supply outside of a particular teachers’
retirement system. Continued work unobserved in administrative data could include teaching for
another school system and employment in another occupation or sector entirely.
I turn to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to create a more comprehensive picture
of the older-age labor supply of college-educated women who spent time as teachers as
compared to other college-educated women who did not. The HRS is a nationally-representative
survey of American households with individuals over the age of 50. The survey began in 1992
-10-

with a group of respondents aged 51 to 61 and continued interviewing them every two years. For
further information on the HRS see the Volume Appendix on the HRS. Since then, samples of
older Americans have been added such that the study now represents all Americans 51 and older.
For this study, I limit the sample to women who report having obtained at least a Bachelor’s
degree.
I include information on women born between 1931 and 1950 whom I can observe at
almost all ages between 60 and 64. Because of sample size issues, I present information for the
following groups of cohorts: 1931 to 1935, 1936 to 1940, 1941 to 1945 and 1946 to 1950. The
most recent wave of the HRS was conducted in 2014, so age 60 to 64 outcomes for the last
cohort group (the 1946 to 1950 cohorts) are incomplete. In discussing comparisons below, I
detail where this data limitation may be important for interpretation.
HRS respondents are asked a series of questions about their occupations at different
points in time. These questions vary across waves of the survey. The most consistent way to
identify teachers across waves of the survey is to categorize anyone who responds to any of the
occupation questions as a teacher (one could say “ever a teacher”). More precisely, I compare
outcomes for college-educated women who were teachers at any point in their lives to other
college-educated women who were never teachers. Note that this includes both public and
private school teachers; I use this definition because many teachers who spent time as private
school teachers were also once public school teachers. Because there are relatively few private
school teachers, I cannot examine them separately and the results are unchanged if I omit them.
There are important differences in training and professionalization between teaching and
many other occupations, even those in which other college-educated women are employed.
Therefore, in some of what follows, I also present comparisons between college-educated

-11-

women who were teachers and other college-educated women classified to have been in the same
general occupation category, managerial and professional specialization occupations, who were
not ever teachers.
Just as in the CPS, the HRS data show evidence of a shift in the occupations of collegeeducated women (Figure 4). More than 45 percent of college-educated women born between
1931 and 1940 were employed as teachers at some point in their work-lives, but just 31 percent
of those born between 1946 to 1950 report ever being employed as teachers. 11 During this 20year span of birth cohorts, there was a 30 percent decline in the fraction of college-educated
women who spent time employed as teachers.
College-educated women who were teachers at some point in their careers do not
experience the same increase in labor force participation at older ages that other college-educated
women who were never teachers do, particularly women in the category of managerial and
professional specialization occupations who were never teachers (Figure 5). 12 Employment of
those who were teachers increased from 53 to 59 percent for the 1931-1935 to the 1946-1950
cohorts, respectively, an increase of 6 percentage points. This is only slightly more than half the
increase in employment of college-educated women who were never teachers in these cohorts,
which was 11 percentage points. The employment rate of other college-educated women in

11

The HRS asks information about occupation and pensions for the jobs about which it collects
information. This includes jobs held at the time of each survey, the last job held and as well as up to three
previous jobs if they were held for at least five years.
12
The censoring of data in 2014 means the women in the 1946 to 1950 cohorts are on average younger
than those in the earlier cohorts. This factor likely makes the employment rates for these cohorts slightly
higher than they should be. Fully 90 percent of career teachers retire when they reach pension eligibility
milestones, which occur in one’s late fifties and early sixties. There is no similar decline in employment
of women when they reach Social Security eligibility. Therefore, the censoring of the data is likely
leading me to underestimate the differences in employment growth across teachers and other collegeeducated women.
-12-

managerial and professional specialty occupations who were never teachers increased by nearly
20 percentage points across these cohorts. Therefore, the increase in employment of those who
were once teachers was only 30 percent as large as the increase for other college-educated
women in these similarly professionalized occupations who were never teachers. Clearly, the
difference in occupational choices between these cohorts is related to the longer work-lives of
more recent cohorts of college-educated women.
Notably, although teachers were about as likely to be working between the ages of 60 and
64 as other college-educated women in the early cohorts, this was no longer the case for women
born between 1946 and 1950 (Figure 5). Instead, women who spent some time as teachers in the
more recent cohorts were about 10 percent (6 percentage points) less likely to be employed at
ages 60 to 64 than the rest of their college-educated peers who were never teachers. The
difference in employment rates is even starker when compared to other women in managerial
and professional specialization occupations who were never teachers. More than three quarters
(77 percent) of college-educated women born between 1946 and 1950 who worked in broader
managerial and professional specialization occupations but were never teachers were employed
at ages 60 to 64. In other words, college-educated women in occupations similar to teaching have
a 30 percent (18 percentage points) higher employment rate than teachers.
Relatedly, there has been an 11 percentage point (30 percent) decline in the fraction of
women in professional service occupations who did not teach that report being retired. At the
same time, the fraction of college-educated women who spent time as teachers who say they are
retired has increased by about 2 percentage points (Figure 6). The recent relative decline in
retirement and increase in employment of college-educated women who were never teachers is
likely driven in part by the decreased likelihood that these women had access to pension benefits

-13-

in their early sixties. As I now detail, the retirement and employment patterns are reflected in the
relative decreased likelihood of collecting pension benefits among those who were never
teachers.
As can be seen in Panel A of Figure 7, the fraction of those who spent time as teachers
and who are collecting pension benefits between ages 60 and 64 hovered around 40 percent for
those born between 1931 and 1945. The fraction collecting Social Security benefits also
remained steady across these cohorts (Panel B, around 23 percent). However, the pension and
Social Security benefit collection of other college-educated women who were never teachers
across the same cohorts both fell slightly (by about 5 percentage points each).
For both the college-educated women who were once teachers and those who were never
teachers, there is a relatively sharp decline in pension benefit collection among the 1946 to 1950
cohorts. This decrease is a distinct break from the previous pattern, particularly for those who
were once teachers. Likely, the censoring of the data for these cohorts drives the drop. Only two
of these cohorts (1946 and 1947) are observed at all of the ages from 60 to 64. The other cohorts
are only observed at the youngest ages in the 60 to 64 range, meaning the set of workers
observed in the HRS in these cohorts is younger, on average, than the set of workers observed
from other cohorts. Since defined benefit pension collection, particularly among teachers, occurs
in the late fifties and early sixties, the censoring causes the pension benefit collection rates
among people who spent time as teachers to be lower than if we were able to observe these
cohorts at all ages from 60 to 64.
To determine whether the censoring is likely to be driving the drop in pension benefits, in
Panel C of Figure 7, I present pension benefit collection for the same cohorts, but at ages 55 to
59. By observing people at earlier ages, I avoid the problem of censoring. Other than an uptick in

-14-

pension benefit collection for the 1941 to 1945 cohorts, the benefit collection between ages 55
and 59 of college-educated women who were once teachers is steady across these cohorts. 13
Therefore, the pension collection between ages 55 to 59 of college-educated women who spent
time as teachers and were born in the 1946 to 1950 cohorts is similar to that of earlier cohorts of
college-educated women who spent time as teachers. This exercise provides evidence that the
censoring of the data for the 1946 to 1950 cohorts when in their mid-sixties drives the lower
pension receipt among women who spent time as teachers seen in Panel A of Figure 7. If we
extrapolate from their behavior at earlier ages, we would expect their fully-realized pension
receipt between ages 60 and 64 to be near 40 percent and similar to that of earlier cohorts of
college-educated women who spent time as teachers.
B. Concurrent Employment and Pension Collection
To this point, I have shown that college-educated women who spent time as teachers
have different patterns of labor supply and retirement at older ages than their similarly educated
and professionalized counterparts. Namely, while the patterns of employment and retirement did
not change much for the women who spent time as teachers that were born between 1931 and
1950, other older college-educated women in these cohorts who were never teachers saw
increases in the propensity to be employed and decreases in the likelihood of being retired.
Retirement and employment are not binary; people may continue to work even once they
consider themselves retired or begin collecting pension benefits (Maestas 2010). This may be

13

Why is there an uptick among the 1941 to 1945 cohorts? Those cohorts reached their late 50s in the late
1990s, which was a period of increased pension generosity and pension buyouts that enabled teachers to
retire earlier than they would have otherwise. We can also see the influence of the buyouts and other
benefit generosity changes of the late 1990s in the slight increase in retirement of teachers ages 60 to 64
from the 1936 to 1940 cohorts.
-15-

particularly true for teachers who begin collecting benefits from a state pension system, but are
not precluded from working for other employers. Of interest is whether the patterns of increased
labor supply at older ages are driven by increased labor supply among those who are not
collecting retirement benefits or if they are driven by increases in labor supply among those who
have begun collecting benefits, but desire to keep working. Since teachers can begin benefit
collection at such early ages, relative to other occupations, the distinction may be of particular
relevance for understanding the labor supply of older workers who have spent time in teaching.
In Figure 8, I examine whether there were shifts in concurrent employment and pension
benefit collection among 60- to 64-year-old college-educated women born between 1931 and
1950 who spent time as teachers and those who did not. In Panel A, the lines plot the rates of
employment for women who were collecting pension or Social Security benefits in their early
sixties. There is little change across cohorts in the rate of employment for these “retired” older
women if they did not spend time in teaching. Among college-educated women who spent time
in teaching and are collecting retirement benefits between ages 60 and 64, there is a large
decrease in the likelihood of employment. In Panel B, we see that the increases in labor supply of
older college-educated women are driven by increases in the propensity of working and not
collecting retirement benefits.
C. Teachers or Public Sector Workers?
Teachers are not the only employees with employer-provided defined benefit pension that
incentivize early retirement. The most obvious group of other employees with defined benefit
pensions are other public sector workers. The labor supply of college-educated women ages 60
to 64 who worked in the public sector increased by 5 percentage points across the cohorts born
between 1931 to 1935 and 1946 to 1950 (Figure 9). As such, the labor supply of government
-16-

workers more closely mirrors that of teachers, rather than that of other college-educated workers
who were not teachers. The comparison makes sense since both groups have disproportionate
access to defined benefit pensions relative to college-educated women in other occupations,
though it could be the case that teachers and other government workers have other things in
common (e.g. preferences) that drive their similarity and the differences between their labor
supply and that of other college-educated women.
V.

Conclusion
To summarize, teachers have different patterns of retirement and labor supply at older

ages than their similarly educated and professionalized counterparts. Namely, recent cohorts of
teachers are less likely to be employed and more likely to be retired between the ages of 60 and
64 than recent cohorts of similarly educated and professionalized women. A likely reason for
these differences is that teachers in these recent cohorts have access to traditional defined benefit
pensions, while women who were never teachers do not. As shown, these defined benefit
pensions allow for, and even incentivize, retirement at earlier ages than Social Security. Support
for this hypothesis stems from similar patterns of employment between ages 60 and 64 among
teachers and other government workers, who also have access to defined benefit pensions.
The difference in pension access across occupations is also likely a primary driver of
changes in the patterns of labor supply among older college-educated women in recent decades.
Specifically, while the patterns of older teachers’ employment and retirement did not change
much for the cohorts between 1931 and 1950, other older college-educated women who were
never teachers saw significant increases in the propensity to be employed and decreases in the
likelihood of being retired.

The employment changes for more recent cohorts correspond to the patterns of change in
pension use in the private sector. Namely, there was a large decrease in the use of defined benefit
pensions in the private sector over the course of recent decades. At the same time, there was a
large decline in the propensity of college-educated women to work as teachers, meaning more
and more college-educated women were employed in the private sector where they had less
access to defined benefit pensions. The combination of these two shifts seems to have played a
significant role in the recent increase in labor supply of older college-educated women.
As mentioned in the beginning of the chapter, the decline in the fraction of collegeeducated women who were teachers was driven by an enormous increase in educational
attainment of women. Of interest is understanding the relative role of these two shifts – the
increase in the fraction of women who were college-educated and the decrease in the fraction of
college-educated who were teachers – in determining the increased labor supply of older women.
In the appendix, I outline a simple two-period model of older-age female labor supply. Using
that model and data reported in this chapter, the model suggests that the decrease in the fraction
of college-educated women who were teachers had an impact on the recent labor supply of older
women that was less than one-tenth as large as the increase in the fraction of women who were
college-educated.
That said, evidence in this chapter suggests that there is some scope for the occupational
shifts among recent cohorts of women to have played a role in the recent increases in the labor
supply of older women. In the context of the model, it is useful to consider how the labor supply
of older women would have changed if there had been an increase in the education of women
without the corresponding decrease in the fraction of college educated women who were ever
teachers. In this counterfactual, the increase in female labor supply between ages 60 and 64

-18-

would have been just one-fifth as large as in the setting where the fraction of college-educated
women who were ever teachers decreased. In other words, the combination of increased
educational attainment and changing occupational choice both played a role in the increases in
the labor supply of older women.

Appendix. Two period model of female labor supply
Consider a two-period model of female labor supply for a given cohort. The fraction of
women with a college degree in the cohort is α; the fraction of these college-educated women
who are teachers is t. Therefore, αt of the cohort are teachers and α(1-t) are college-educated,
but not teachers. The share of the cohort that are not college-educated is 1- α.
In period one, all women work. In the second period, some women work and others
retire. The fraction of teachers that work in the second period is λ. The fraction of collegeeducated women who are not teachers that work in the second period is β. The fraction of the
less educated women that work in the second period is γ. Therefore, the fraction of women
working in the second period is
𝐸 2 = 𝜆𝛼𝑡 + 𝛽𝛼(1 − 𝑡) + 𝛾(1 − 𝛼).
The change in the fraction working in second period that results from a change in the
fraction of college-educated is
𝑑𝐸2
𝑑𝛼

= 𝑡(𝜆 − 𝛽) + 𝛽 − 𝛾.

The change in the fraction working in second period that results from a change in the fraction of
teachers is
𝑑𝐸2
𝑑𝑡

= 𝛼(𝜆 − 𝛽).

Using data from the HRS on the proportion of each group working at older ages (λ, β, γ), the
proportion college-educated (α), and the proportion of college educated who are teachers (t), I
can estimate the relative importance of changes in α and t. Using information on these
parameters from the earliest cohorts, the effect of a change in the fraction of college-educated
women who are teachers on employment in the second period is one percent as large (in absolute
value) as the effect of a change in the fraction of women who are college-educated. Using
information on the parameters from the more recent cohorts, the former is one-tenth as large as
the latter.
