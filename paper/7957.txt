1. Introduction
For several decades, high in‡ation has been the main threat to monetary stability. The successful
disin‡ation and resulting low in‡ation rate in many countries, together with the problematic
situation in Japan, has brought the potential threat of de‡ation and a binding zero bound
on nominal interest rates (a liquidity trap) into focus. The zero bound on the central bank’s
instrument rate would seem to prevent expansionary monetary policy in situations when it would
be mostly needed. Many papers have recently discussed the consequences of the zero bound and
a liquidity trap, how to avoid these and how to escape if trapped, often with speci…c references
to Japan, where the threat of de‡ation and a binding zero bound has been a reality for several
years.1
There seems to be considerable agreement on how to avoid the zero bound and a liquidity
trap. Many papers recommend an explicit positive symmetric in‡ation target (say 2 percent per
year). Many central banks already implement such in‡ation targets. Another possibility is an
upward-sloping price-level target path (say rising at 2 percent per year), although there is yet
no central bank that implements explicit price-level targeting (with either a ‡at or an upwardsloping price-level target path).2 Svensson [63] also suggests that prudent central banks should
prepare a set of emergency measures, to be used at preannounced indications of an immanent
liquidity trap. These emergency measures would include unorthodox open-market operations
in long government bonds and corporate bonds, direct lending to the private sector, foreignexchange interventions and …scal and monetary cooperation including a money-…nanced …scal
expansion involving government expenditure complementary to private consumption.
There seems to be less agreement on how to escape from a liquidity trap if already trapped.
Krugman [33] has suggested that the central bank should make a commitment to future monetary
expansion and has proposed an in‡ation target for Japan of 4 percent per year for 15 years. The
idea is that this would induce in‡ation expectations that would reduce the real interest rate
(even if the nominal interest rate is at the zero bound) and thereby stimulate the economy

appendix B], Ueda [69] and [70], Uhlig [71], Wolman [74] and [75], and Woodford [76]. An early contribution is
Brunner and Meltzer [12].

An in‡ation target allows base drift in the price level and makes the latter nonstationary, whereas a pricelevel target (path) does not allow base drift in the price level but makes it (trend-)stationary. The only real-world
example of explicit price-level targeting is Sweden during part of the 1930s, see Berg and Jonung [7].

out of the liquidity trap. A problem with this suggestion is that a mere announcement of a
future monetary expansion or an in‡ation target need not be credible with the private sector
and therefore not a¤ect in‡ation expectations, in the absence of any commitment mechanism
or any action supporting the announcement. Furthermore, the high in‡ation target for Japan
for 15 years may not be credible, since the Bank of Japan might be tempted to reduce the
in‡ation target to a more conventional level (say 2 percent) once the economy has escaped
from the liquidity trap. Posen [55], analyzing the economic situation of Japan, suggests a …scal
expansion and a more moderate in‡ation target of 3 percent that is reduced to 2 percent after
a few years, but he recommends avoiding a yen depreciation. Meltzer [46] and [43] recommends
increasing the monetary base, with reference to a real-balance e¤ect on aggregate demand and
that increased supply of money will a¤ect a number of other asset prices and interest rates in
an expansionary direction, even if short nominal interest rates are zero, especially depreciating
the domestic currency. A problem with a real-balance e¤ect on aggregate demand in a liquidity
trap is that if the private sector is already satiated with liquidity, increasing liquidity is unlikely
to a¤ect consumption.3 Furthermore, in a liquidity trap, short nominal government bonds
and money are (close to) perfect substitutes, and open-market operations increasing private
holdings of money and reducing private holdings of short government bonds would have little
e¤ect. Accordingly, Meltzer recommends open-market operations in other assets than short
government bonds, for instance, long government bonds or foreign-currency government bonds,
to reduce long bond rates and depreciate the domestic currency, relying on the assumption
of imperfect substitutability between these assets and money/short bonds, but without any
discussion of the degree of imperfect substitutability and how large open-market operations
would be needed.
The reason why nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero is that an alternative to investing in short government bonds is simply to hold cash at zero interest rates. Buiter and
Panigirtzoglou [14] and Goodfriend [26] discuss a more exotic way of eliminating the zero bound
by introducing a carry tax, a tax on holding reserves and currency. This would allow negative nominal interest rates in equilibrium, and allow the central bank to achieve the desired
stimulating negative interest rate. Although it seems technically feasible to introduce a carry
tax for commercial-bank reserves in the central bank, introducing a carry tax on currency re3
As discussed by Woodford [76], Nelson [48] and McCallum [39], a direct money e¤ect would enter if real
balances enter the representative agent’s utility function and this utility function is not additively separable in
consumption and real balances but has a positive cross-derivative. However, reasonable parameter values make
any such e¤ect so small that it can safely be disregarded, also outside a liquidity trap.

quires technological innovations (electronic chips in the notes, for instance) and also implies the
inconvenience of notes circulating with the same nomination but trading at di¤erent discounts.
McCallum [39] has recommended foreign-exchange interventions to depreciate the currency
and, in this way, stimulate the economy when the interest rate is zero. His argument either
ignores uncovered interest parity or relies on a portfolio-balance e¤ect, whereby the relative
supply of domestic- and foreign-currency denominated assets a¤ects the foreign-exchange risk
premium and thereby the exchange rate. Although huge foreign-exchange interventions are
likely to a¤ect the exchange rate (if not because of a portfolio-balance e¤ect, at least because
of the expectations of future depreciation they may induce), a problem with this argument is
that the size of the portfolio-balance e¤ect is controversial and most empirical work on the
e¤ect of sterilized foreign-exchange interventions indicates that the portfolio e¤ect is small or
even negligible. McCallum does not provide any calculations of the magnitude of the foreignexchange interventions that would be needed to signi…cantly depreciate the yen.
Bernanke [8], analyzing the situation in Japan, discusses several potential remedies, especially
a relatively high in‡ation target in the 3–4 percent range for a number of years to undo the “pricelevel gap” created by several years of zero or negative in‡ation, aggressive foreign-exchange
interventions to depreciate the yen, and money-…nanced …scal transfers.
At the Jackson-Hole Symposium in August 1999, Svensson [63] suggested that all the emergency measures prepared in advance by prudent central banks (see above) should be used, in
the hope that some of these would work. In particular, a temporary exchange-rate peg was
discussed [63, Section 5.3]:
Could the central bank peg the exchange rate and this way escape the liquidity trap?
Such pegging would involve a commitment to arbitrarily large nonsterilized foreignexchange interventions, buying foreign exchange and selling domestic currency at
the pegged rate. Again, for such pegging to succeed, market expectations of future
appreciation would have to change. If they do not change, huge foreign-exchange
interventions could be absorbed by the foreign-exchange market. The question is
then, in such a game of attrition, who will blink …rst, the market or the central
bank? Compared to the usual speculative attack on a pegged exchange rate to force
a devaluation, the central bank does not risk running out of foreign-exchange reserves;
instead it just has to create more domestic currency. The fact that a commitment to a
pegged exchange rate is immediately veri…able and the technical possibility to always
create more domestic currency may make the commitment more credible in the short
run than a commitment to an in‡ation target when interest rates have reached zero.
It cannot be excluded that an exchange-rate peg can serve as a temporary emergency
measure, an intermediate step towards ful…lling an in‡ation target.
3

Thus, this argument relies on a commitment by the central bank to buy and sell unlimited
amounts of foreign exchange at the given pegged exchange rate. In particular, it does not rely
on any portfolio-balance e¤ects; instead it relies on the change in private-sector expectations
of future exchange rates brought about by the commitment to unlimited interventions at the
pegged exchange rate. This paper expands on this idea and argues that there is indeed a safe
and foolproof way of escaping from a liquidity trap in an open economy, namely (1) announcing
an upward-sloping price-level target path (that is, corresponding to a positive long-run in‡ation
target) above the current price level, (2) announcing that (a) the currency will be devalued and
the exchange rate pegged at a level corresponding to a real depreciation relative to a steady-state
level, and (b) the peg will be abandoned in favor of price-level targeting (or in‡ation targeting)
once the price-level target path has been reached, and (3) just doing it.4

5

It is argued that this “foolproof way” will jump-start the economy by (a) a real depreciation
of the domestic currency relative to a long-run equilibrium level, (b) a lower long real interest rate
(since there must eventually be a real appreciation of the domestic currency, and expected real
appreciation of the currency is associated with relatively low short and long domestic real interest
rates), and (c) increased in‡ation expectations (since, with the exchange-rate peg, expected
real appreciation is associated with expected domestic in‡ation). The output gap will increase
because of (a) and (b), and de‡ation will turn into in‡ation because of (a), (c) and the increased
output gap. The economy will …nd itself out of the liquidity trap (a credible peg will be associated
with a positive short nominal interest rate). The price-level will rise and eventually reach the
price-level target path, after which the peg will be abandoned.
The foolproof way acknowledges the crucial role of private-sector in‡ation expectations and
includes a concrete way for the central bank of a¤ecting those expectations. It handles the
credibility problem associated with Krugman’s proposal, in that it speci…es what the central
bank should do and not just what it should say, and by giving the central bank an arena, the
foreign-exchange market, where it can quickly demonstrate its resolve to the market by success
in pegging the exchange rate. In particular, a price-level target path is a more precise way of
4

In September 1999, Feldstein [21] similarly suggested an exchange rate depreciation, although followed by a
gradual appreciation: “Japan could simply announce that it wants an exchange rate of, say, 140 yen per dollar
and is prepared to buy dollars for yen until it achieves that goal. Once markets saw that the Japanese were
serious, the exchange rate would adjust and further dollar purchases would be largely unnecessary. The Japanese
government could add that it recognizes that such an exchange rate cannot last inde…nitely and that it expects
to permit the yen to rise at, say, 8% a year, reaching 129 after one year, 119 after two years and so on until the
currency reaches a level at which intervention is no longer needed.”
5
In October 1999, Dale Hendersen, in an intervention from the ‡oor at the conference “Monetary Policy in
a Low In‡ation Environment,” similarly suggested a temporary peg of the yen and that such a peg would be
credible (see Blinder [11]).

undoing the “price-level gap” caused by several years of zero or negative in‡ation than the high
in‡ation target suggested by Krugman [33] and Bernanke [8]. The price-level target path allows
in‡ation to be higher …rst and lower later, thereby providing an “anchored expansion,” indeed
better anchored than the variable in‡ation target suggested by Posen [55].
By including the price-level target path, the foolproof way makes the temporary peg consistent with desirable long-run in‡ation expectations. It di¤ers from McKinnon’s [41] and [42]
proposal of a bilateral agreement between U.S. and Japan to stabilize the yen/dollar exchange
rate, by the initial real depreciation and the temporary use of the peg (and by being unilateral).
The foolproof way is consistent with Meltzer’s [46] and McCallum’s [39] proposals to depreciate
the currency, but it does not rely on the somewhat controversial magnitude of a portfoliobalance e¤ect. Instead, it relies on a¤ecting exchange-rate expectations via a commitment to
the exchange-rate peg, regardless of the magnitude of any portfolio-balance e¤ect; in case there
is no portfolio-balance e¤ect it is consistent with uncovered interest parity.6 Furthermore, in
contrast to these proposals, the foolproof way provides a precise framework, the peg, for the
depreciation, and for abandoning the peg in favor of the long-run in‡ation or price-level target.7
Indeed, it appears to be a foolproof way for an open economy in general, and Japan in particular,
of escaping from a liquidity trap.
Section 2 discusses the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in an open economy,
with and without the zero bound, as a background. Section 3 presents the foolproof way of
escaping from a liquidity trap in some detail. Section 4 contains some conclusions for Japan.
The appendix contains some technical details.

2. The transmission mechanism in an open economy
In order to discuss the e¤ect of monetary policy actions when the zero bound is binding, we
need to specify the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in general, and with the zero
bound in particular. Several similar models of monetary policy in an open economy have been
6
Thus, no portfolio-balance e¤ect is assumed in the model used below. However, as discussed in appendix
B, one interpretation of the equilibrium resulting from the temporary peg is that the corresponding commitment
to unlimited foreign exchange interventions poses a threat of huge interventions in support of the peg. At such
huge interventions, a portfolio-balance e¤ect would realistically appear and a¤ect the exchange rate. This threat
then a¤ects exchange-rate expectations and supports the temporary peg, and a portfolio-balance e¤ect need not
be observed at the moderate interventions that occur in equilibrium.
7
The foolproof way di¤ers from Feldstein’s [21] proposal (see footnote 4) by maintaining the peg until the
price-level target paths is reached and hence let domestic in‡ation achieve the real appreciation after the initial
depreciation, instead of Feldstein’s gradual appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. Maintaining the peg is
essential for the foolproof way in generating in‡ation and in‡ation expectations.

presented.8 Here, I use a simpli…ed variant of a model derived and discussed in detail in Svensson
[65] and [61, appendix].9 The main characteristic of the transmission mechanism in this and
similar models are:
² Domestic in‡ation (increases in the general price level of domestically produced goods
and services) depends positively on expected future domestic in‡ation (the in‡ationexpectations channel to domestic in‡ation) and marginal cost of the production. Marginal
cost, in turn, depends positively on the output gap (the aggregate-demand channel to domestic in‡ation) and the exchange rate (via imported intermediate inputs; the exchangerate channel to domestic in‡ation).
² Consumer-Price-Index (CPI) in‡ation depends positively on domestic in‡ation and in‡ation in imported …nal goods and services. The latter depends positively on the rate of
domestic-currency depreciation (the direct exchange-rate channel to CPI in‡ation).
² The output gap (the di¤erence between output and potential output) depends, via domestic aggregate demand, negatively on the long real interest rate (the real-interest rate
channel to aggregate demand) and, via the relative price between domestic and foreign
goods, positively on the real exchange rate (the exchange-rate channel to aggregate demand).
² The long real interest rate depends positively on expected future short nominal rates (the
central bank’s instrument rate) and negatively on expected future domestic in‡ation.
The main property used in the development of the foolproof way of escaping from a liquidity
trap in section 3 is that, everything else equal, the output gap increases from (a) a real depreciation of the domestic currency and (b) a reduction in the long real interest rate. Domestic
in‡ation increases from an increase in the output gap, (a), and (c) an increase in private-sector
expectations of future domestic in‡ation. Thus, any open-economy model with the above rather
uncontroversial characteristics will do.
The model of Svensson [65] also introduces somewhat realistic relative lags in the e¤ects of
monetary-policy actions on output and in‡ation as well as additional inertia in these variables.

See Batini and Haldane [4], Benigno [6], Galí and Monacelli [24], Leitemo [37], McCallum and Nelson [40],
Obstfeld and Rogo¤ [49], Svensson [65] and Weerapana [73].
9
The model di¤ers from that in Svensson [65] and [61, appendix] in that the nominal variables and some of
the real variables are not measured only as deviations from a steady-state or trend level and in that the zero
bound is made explicit.

6

These lags imply that expectations play an even more important role: Current domestic in‡ation
and output are predetermined, and only future domestic in‡ation and output can be a¤ected
by monetary-policy actions. Furthermore, it is not the current real exchange rate and current
long real rate but the expected future real exchange rate and the expected future real interest
rate that are of importance for private-sector decisions.
The model above does not explicitly model a credit channel (see, for instance, Bernanke,
Gertler and Gilchrist [10]) and the more controversial transmission channels involving direct
aggregate-demand e¤ects of money (see Meltzer [46], Woodford [76] and Nelson [48]), the e¤ect
of foreign-exchange interventions on the foreign-exchange risk premium (see McCallum [39]),
and the price-gap or real-money-gap e¤ects on in‡ation in P ¤ models (see Hallman, Porter and
Small [27], Tödter and Reimers [68], Svensson [64] and Gerlach and Svensson [25]). Indeed, the
foolproof way of escaping a liquidity trap presented in section 3 does not depend on the presence
(or the absence) of those transmission channels.10
Readers not interested in the more detailed description of the model and discussion of the
transmission mechanism may prefer to skim the next few subsections or even jump directly to
section 3.
2.1. An illustrative model of an open economy
The model has an aggregate-supply equation (Phillips curve) of the form
¼t+1 = ®¼ ¼t + (1 ¡ ®¼ )¼t+2jt + ®y yt+1jt + ®q (qt+1jt ¡ q) + "t+1 :

(2.1)

Here, for any variable x, xt+¿ jt denotes Et xt+¿ , that is, the rational expectation of xt+¿ in period
t + ¿ , conditional on the information available in period t. Furthermore,
¼t ´ pt ¡ pt¡1

(2.2)

denotes (log) domestic in‡ation in period t, where pt is the (log) prices of domestic(ally produced)
goods. The variable yt is the output gap, de…ned as
yt ´ ytd ¡ ytn ;

(2.3)

where ytd is (log) aggregate demand (output) and ytn is (log) potential output (for simplicity, both
are measured as deviations from a constant steady-state level, although the model could also be
10
Except possibly, as discussed in appendix B, that the temporary peg is supported by a threat of huge foreignexchange interventions that do not materialize in equilibrium but would a¤ect the foreign-exchange risk premium
and depreciate the domestic currency if they were to materialize.

formulated in terms of deviations from a steady-state trend). Potential output is assumed to be
exogenous and stochastic and follows
n
= ° ny ytn + ´ nt+1 ;
yt+1

(2.4)

where the coe¢cient ° ny ful…lls 0 · ° ny < 1 and ´ nt+1 is a serially uncorrelated zero-mean shock
to potential output (a “productivity” shock). The variable qt is the (log) real exchange rate,
de…ned as
qt ´ st + p¤t ¡ pt ;

(2.5)

where p¤t the (log) foreign price level, st denotes the (log) exchange rate (in units of domestic
currency per unit foreign currency), and q is the steady-state level of the real exchange rate.11
Finally, "t+1 is a serially correlated zero-mean “cost-push” shock. Thus, we have two distinct
“supply” shocks, namely a productivity shock and a cost-push shock. The coe¢cients ®¼ , ®y ,
¯ y and ®q are constant and positive; furthermore ®¼ and ¯ y are smaller than unity.
This supply function is derived in Svensson [61, appendix] (along the lines of Rotemberg
and Woodford [57]), from the …rst-order condition of an optimization problem and hence, with
some microfoundations. In‡ation depends on lagged in‡ation and previous expectations of the
output gap and future in‡ation. It is similar to a Calvo-type [15] Phillips curve in that in‡ation
depends upon expectations of future in‡ation. It is similar to the Fuhrer and Moore [23] Phillips
curve in that in‡ation depends on both lagged in‡ation and expected future in‡ation (see also
Estrella and Fuhrer [19]). Domestic in‡ation is assumed to be predetermined one period.12 The
term including qt+1jt in (2.1) represents the e¤ect of expected costs of imported intermediate
inputs (or resulting wage compensation).
Let ! be the share of imported goods in the CPI.13 Then CPI in‡ation, ¼ct , ful…lls14
¼ct = (1 ¡ !)¼ t + !¼ft = ¼t + !(qt ¡ qt¡1 ):

(2.6)

Here, ¼ft denotes domestic-currency in‡ation of imported foreign goods, which ful…lls
¼ft ´ pft ¡ pft¡1 ´ ¼¤t + st ¡ st¡1 = ¼t + qt ¡ qt¡1 ;
11

Since there are no nontraded goods, the real exchange rate also constitutes the terms of trade.
In Svensson [65] domestic in‡ation is assumed to be predetermined two periods in advance, in order to have a
two-period lag in the e¤ect of monetary policy on domestic in‡ation (and hence, a longer lag than for the output
gap, see below).
13
The share of imported goods in the CPI is approximately constant for small deviations around a steady
state. It is exactly constant if the utility function over domestic and imported goods has a constant elatisticity of
substitution equal to unity (that is, is a Cobb-Douglas utility function), as is actually assumed in Svensson [65].
14
Since there is no interest-rate component in the CPI, it is best interpreted as CPIX; that is, CPI in‡ation
(and domestic in‡ation) are exclusive of any credit service costs.
12

where
pft ´ p¤t + st

(2.7)

is the (log) domestic-currency price of imported foreign goods, and
¼¤t ´ p¤t ¡ p¤t¡1

(2.8)

is foreign in‡ation. That is, for simplicity, I assume that there is no lag in the pass-through of
import costs to domestic prices of imported goods.15
Aggregate demand for domestically produced goods is given by the aggregate-demand equation (expressed in terms of the output gap, (2.3)),
¤
+ ¯ q (qt+1jt ¡ q) ¡ (° ny ¡ ¯ y )ytn + ´dt+1 ¡ ´nt+1 ;
yt+1 = ¯ y yt ¡ ¯ ½ ½t+1jt + ¯ ¤y yt+1jt

(2.9)

where yt¤ is (log) foreign output (measured as a deviation from a constant steady-state level), all
coe¢cients are constant and nonnegative, with 0 · ¯ y < 1; and ´ dt+1 is a serially uncorrelated
zero-mean “demand” shock. The variable ½t is de…ned as
½t ´

(2.11)

where it is the (short) nominal interest rate. The constant steady-state level of the real interest
rate is denoted r > 0. The zero bound on the nominal interest rate implies that it ful…lls
it ¸ 0.

(2.12)

The nominal interest rate is (normally) the instrument of the central bank.16
Thus, the variable ½t is the sum of current and expected future deviations of the real interest
rates from the steady-state level of the real rate. The sum enters in the aggregate demand, since
the latter is the forward solution of an Euler condition involving the short real interest rate,
cf. Svensson [61]. The sum always converges in the equilibria examined below. The variable
½t is (under the expectations hypothesis) related to the deviations from the steady-state level
15

There are obviously more realistic and less simplistic ways of modelling the pass-through of exchange-rate
movements to domestic prices ofP
imported …nal goods.

Hence, for a long (but …nite) maturity T , the variable ½t is approximately the product of the
long real rate and its maturity,
½t ¼ T (rtT ¡ r).

(2.13)

The aggregate demand is predetermined one period in advance. It depends on lagged expectations of accumulated future real interest rates, foreign output and the real exchange rate.
The aggregate-demand equation is derived, from a …rst-order condition consistent with optimization and hence with some microfoundations, and discussed in further detail in Svensson
[61, appendix]. A crucial assumption is that the output gap, the current account and the real
exchange rate are all stationary.17

18

The exchange rate ful…lls the interest parity condition
it ¡ i¤t = st+1jt ¡ st + 't ;

(2.14)

where i¤t is the foreign nominal interest rate and 't is the foreign-exchange risk premium. The
foreign-exchange risk premium incorporates any exogenous residual disturbances to the exchange
rate, including changes in portfolio preferences, credibility e¤ects, etc. In order to eliminate the
potentially non-stationary exchange rate, I use (2.5) to rewrite this as the real interest parity
condition in terms of the stationary real exchange rate,19
qt+1jt = qt + (it ¡ ¼t+1jt ) ¡ (i¤t ¡ ¼¤t+1jt ) ¡ 't :

(2.15)

Note that qt and ½t are closely related. Solving qt forward and exploiting that qT approaches
q when T ! 1, we have

17
There is an obvious similarity to the closed-economy aggregate demand function of Fuhrer and Moore [23],
except that a lagged long real coupon-bond rate enters in their function.
18
The natural output level enters in (2.9), because the equation is …rst derived for the level of aggregate
demand. It is then expressed in terms of the output gap by subtraction of the natural output level.
19
Equation (2.15) may give the impression that the real exchange rate will have a unit root. This is not the
case in equilibrium, however. All real variables, in‡ation rates and interest rates are then stationary. The nominal
price level and exchange rate are nonstationary under in‡ation targeting with base-drift in the price level.

10

where the rt¤ ´ i¤t ¡ ¼¤t+1jt is the foreign real interest rate, r¤ is the foreign steady-state real
interest rate, ½¤t is de…ned in analogy with (2.10), and I use (2.20) below as well as the fact
that the steady-state domestic and foreign real interest rate will be related the steady-state
foreign-exchange risk premium, ', according to
r ¡ r¤ = '.

(2.17)

Thus, the real exchange rate is related to the negative di¤erence between the domestic and
foreign expected future deviations of the real interest rate from the steady-state real interest
rate.
For simplicity, I assume that foreign in‡ation, foreign output and the foreign-exchange risk
premium follow stationary univariate AR(1) processes,
¼¤t+1 = ¼¤ + ° ¤¼ (¼ ¤t ¡ ¼¤ ) + "¤t+1

(2.18)

't+1 = ' + ° ' ('t ¡ ') + » ';t+1 ;

(2.20)

where the coe¢cients are nonnegative and less than unity, the shocks are serially uncorrelated
and zero-mean, and ¼¤ and ' are the constant steady-state levels of foreign in‡ation and the
foreign-exchange risk premium, respectively. Furthermore, for simplicity, I assume that the
foreign interest rate follows a Taylor-type instrument rule; that is, it is a linear function of
foreign in‡ation and output,
i¤t = i¤ + f¼¤ (¼ ¤t ¡ ¼¤ ) + fy¤ yt¤ + » ¤it ;

(2.21)

where i¤ ´ r¤ + ¼¤ (where r¤ is the constant steady-state foreign real interest rate) is a constant

steady-state level of the foreign interest rate, the coe¢cients are constant and positive, and » ¤it

is a serially uncorrelated zero-mean shock. These speci…cations of the exogenous variables are
chosen for simplicity; obviously the exogenous variables may be cross-correlated in more general
ways without causing any di¢culties, and additional variables can be introduced to represent
the state of the rest of the world.20
Fiscal policy is not explicitly represented. It is implicitly assumed to be “Ricardian,” so that
the government’s intertemporal budget constraint is an identity and the Fiscal Theory of the
Price Level does not apply.
20

Weerapana [73] extends this model to a two-country world with endogenous foreign variables.

11

2.2. The loss function, state-space form, and equilibrium
A possible loss function corresponds to “‡exible (domestic) in‡ation targeting” with a constant
in‡ation target ¼
^ (thus, stars denote foreign variables and hats denote target levels). This can
be represented as a period loss
^ )2 + ¸yt2 ;
Lt = (¼t ¡ ¼

As shown in Svensson [61], the model can be written in a convenient state-space form. Let
Xt and Yt denote the (column) vectors of predetermined state variables and goal variables,
respectively, let xt denote the (column) vector of forward-looking variables, and let vt denote
the (column) vector of innovations to the predetermined state variables,
Xt = (¼t ; yt ; ¼¤t ¡ ¼¤ ; yt¤ ; i¤t ¡ i¤ ; 't ¡ '; ytn ; qt¡1 ¡ q)0

with the diagonal (1; ¸), i ´ r + ¼
^ is the steady-state level of the nominal interest rate, and

Y^ ´ (^
¼; 0)0 is the vector of target levels (see Svensson [61, appendix] for details23 ).

21
Flexible CPI in‡ation targeting would have the period loss function Lt = (¼ ct ¡ ¼
^ )2 + ¸yt2 . Svensson [65] and
Aoki [1] compare domestic and CPI in‡ation targeting from di¤erent points of view.
22
Intuitively, predetermined variables are determined by lagged variables and current exogenous shocks, whereas
forward-looking variables (non-predetermined variables) are also a¤ected by expectations of future forward-looking
variables. More rigorously, predetermined and forward-looking variables have one-period-ahead prediction errors
that are exogenous and endogenous, respectively.
23
As mentioned above, the variant of the model presented here di¤ers in that domestic in‡ation is predetermined
one period ahead rather than two and that the steady-state levels of some of the variables are not set equal to
zero).

12

If the zero bound (2.12) is disregarded, the model is linear with a quadratic loss function.
Then, the model is a standard linear stochastic regulator problem with rational expectations
and forward-looking variables.
With forward-looking variables, there is a di¤erence between the case of discretion and the
case of commitment to an optimal rule. In the discretion case, the central bank each period
minimizes the intertemporal loss function under discretion. Then, the forward-looking variables
will, in equilibrium, be linear functions of the predetermined variables,
xt = HXt ,

(2.27)

where the matrix H is endogenously determined. The equilibrium reaction function will be a
linear function of the predetermined variables,
¹
it = i + f(Xt ¡ X);

(2.28)

¹ ´ (^
where the row vector f is endogenously determined and X
¼; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0)0 denotes the

steady-state levels of the predetermined variables.24

The dynamics of the economy are then described by
¹ + vt+1 ;
¹ + M11 (Xt ¡ X)
Xt+1 = X

(2.29)

Yt = (C1 + C2 H + Ci f)Xt ;

are partitioned according to Xt and xt .
When the zero bound is taken into account and binding in some states of the world, the solution is no longer linear and must be found with non-linear dynamic programming. In equilibrium,
the forward-looking variables and the instrument will still be functions of the predetermined
variables,
xt = H(Xt );

(2.33)

it = F (Xt );

(2.34)

24
In the commitment case, the optimal policy and the forward-looking variables also depend on the shadow
prices of the forward-looking variables. Only the discretion solution is considered here. See Svensson and Woodford
[66] for the di¤erence between discretion and commitment and its importance for in‡ation targeting.

13

but the functions H(¢) and F (¢) are no longer linear.
2.3. The transmission channels
In summary, the model consists of the aggregate-supply equation, (2.1), the CPI equation, (2.6),
the aggregate-demand equation, (2.9), the de…nitions of the sum of current and expected future
real interest rates and the real interest rate, (2.10) and (2.11), real interest-rate parity, (2.15),
and the equations for the exogenous variables: foreign in‡ation and output, the foreign-exchange
risk premium and the foreign interest rate, (2.18)–(2.21).
Let us temporarily disregard the zero bound (2.12) and examine how the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is modelled here. The timing and the lags have been selected to
provide somewhat realistic relative lags for the transmission of monetary policy. Consider a fall
in the instrument, the short nominal interest rate it , in period t. Current domestic in‡ation
and the output gap are predetermined. Domestic in‡ation in period t + 1 will be sticky, and
so are domestic in‡ation expectations, ¼t+1jt . Thus, the short real interest rate, rt , is a¤ected,
and falls.25 The forward-looking variables ½t and qt are a¤ected by the current real interest rate
but also by expected future real interest rates. Thus, the change in the whole expected future
path of the real interest rate matters. Assume that there is some persistence in the real rate
fall, so that also the expected real interest rate in the near future falls. Then, ½t falls and qt
rises unambiguously. That is, the long real rate falls, and there is a real depreciation of the
domestic currency. The real depreciation a¤ects current CPI in‡ation ¼ ct by (2.6), the direct
exchange-rate channel to CPI in‡ation.
Furthermore, ½t+1jt falls, that is the expected future long real rate falls, since expected future
real rates fall. This increases the output gap, yt+1 , by (2.9), and hence increases aggregate
demand (since aggregate demand is the endogenous component of the output gap). This can be
called the real-interest-rate channel to aggregate demand. Furthermore, the expected future real
exchange rate, qt+1jt , rises, which further increases aggregate demand one period ahead, which
can be called the exchange-rate channel to aggregate demand.
Having traced the transmission channels to aggregate demand, we can examine the e¤ect on
domestic in‡ation one period ahead, ¼t+1 , in (2.1). In the Calvo model with in‡ation predetermined one period ahead that lies behind (2.1), domestic in‡ation in period t+1 is determined by
25

In Svensson [65] and [61], ¼ t+1jt is predetermined (because domestic in‡ation is assumed to be predetermined
two periods ahead), so it a¤ects rt one-to-one. In this model, ¼t+1jt is endogenous, and rt being increasing in it
is an equilibrium property.

14

expectations in period t of in‡ation in period t + 2 and of marginal cost of production in period
t + 1. Marginal cost is increasing in the output gap and, because imported-intermediate inputs
are used in production, also in the real exchange rate. This is the reason yt+1jt and qt+1jt enter
in (2.1). Thus, expectations of future increases in the output gap and real exchange rate from
the expected fall in future real rates will lead to a rise in domestic in‡ation one period ahead.
This can be called the aggregate-demand channel and the exchange-rate channel to domestic
in‡ation (this can be said to constitute a marginal-cost channel to domestic in‡ation).
Finally, domestic in‡ation in period t+1 also depends on expectations of domestic in‡ation in
period t + 2, the term ¼t+2jt in (2.1). With persistence of the increase in in‡ation in period t + 1,
in‡ation expectations for t + 2 rise, which then adds to domestic in‡ation in period t + 1. This is
a direct expectations channel to domestic in‡ation in period t + 2. Naturally, this is not the only
expectations channel; indeed, expectations channels abound in the transmission mechanism. We
have seen above that ½t+1jt and qt+1jt that enter into one-period-ahead aggregate demand in (2.9)
are determined by accumulated expected future real interest rate. For a given future nominal
interest rate, higher expected in‡ation also further decreases the expected future real rate, and
hence, adds to the positive e¤ect on aggregate demand. Indeed, expectations of future variables
are crucial in the transmission mechanism.
Thus, by assumption, there is no lag in the monetary policy e¤ect on CPI in‡ation, a oneperiod lag in the e¤ect on aggregate demand, and a one-period lag in the e¤ect on domestic
in‡ation. Both VAR evidence and practical central-bank experience indicate that there is a
shorter lag for the e¤ect of a monetary-policy action on CPI in‡ation than for aggregate demand
and domestic in‡ation.26
2.3.1. A credit channel and a direct money channel
The reader may have noticed that two potential transmission channels have not been modelled
above, namely the credit channel and a separate money channel (for instance, a real-balance
channel). A more elaborate model than the one underlying (2.1) and (2.9) with capital market imperfections would, as discussed in Bernanke and Gertler [9] and Bernanke, Gertler and
Gilchrist [10], allow some …rms’ and consumers’ borrowing possibilities to depend on their collateral (their balance sheet). These agents then face marginal borrowing costs exceeding the real
interest rate referred to above, by an “external-…nance premium”. A reduction in the real inter26

See, for instance, Cushman and Zha [18].

15

est rate would then increase the value of the collateral and thereby allow these agents to borrow
at a lower external-…nance premium and, in this way, additionally stimulate aggregate demand
beyond the “pure” real interest rate e¤ect discussed above, via a “balance-sheet channel”. As
detailed in Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist [10], improving balance sheets and increased credit
‡ows may also have signi…cant feedback and magni…cation e¤ects; what these authors call the
“…nancial accelerator”. Since these e¤ects would have the same signs as the “pure” real interest
rate e¤ects, they would, in the present simpli…ed model, appear as larger coe¢cients on the real
interest rate in (2.9) (although a more elaborate model would also introduce the initial …nancial
position as an important state variable). Thus, in the present model, we take the credit channel
to be included in the interest-rate channel to aggregate demand.
What about a direct money channel, for instance, a real-balance e¤ect, to aggregate demand,
in addition to the real interest-rate channel emphasized above? Naturally, money lies behind
the transmission mechanism outlined below in the sense that central banks use open-market
operations, especially repurchase contracts, to a¤ect the amount of reserves supplied and, in
this way, supply whatever reserves are demanded at the desired level of the instrument rate (an
operating target), an overnight rate or a two-week repurchase rate, say. Given this, nothing is
lost if we think of the instrument rate as the central-bank instrument and consider reserves to
be demand-determined. A direct money channel, however, is something di¤erent than supplying
reserves to achieve a particular level of the instrument rate; furthermore it involves broad money
rather than the monetary base. Meltzer [46] and Nelson [48] …nd some empirical support for a
direct e¤ect of real money on aggregate demand, in addition to the e¤ect via the interest rate.
Such an e¤ect might be expected to show up as real money entering on the right side of (2.9), in
addition to the other variables. However, as Woodford [76] emphasizes, to the extent that such an
e¤ect is interpreted as a wealth e¤ect, the Euler condition used in deriving an aggregate-demand
relation as (2.9) already incorporates any wealth e¤ects (and, more generally, an intertemporal
budget constraint).27 As discussed by Woodford [76], Nelson [48] and McCallum [39], a direct
money e¤ect would arise, if real balances entered the representative agent’s utility function and
this utility function was not additively separable in consumption and real balances but had a
positive cross-derivative. However, reasonable parameter values make any such e¤ect so small
that it can safely be disregarded. Meltzer [46] and Nelson [48] emphasize that a direct e¤ect
27
This is due to the fact that the Euler condition that is solved forward to get (2.9) is such that current
consumption depends negatively on the real interest rate and positively on expected future consumption, and
the wealth e¤ect (and generally the impact of the intertemporal budget constraint) enters via expected future
consumption.

16

of money may instead be a proxy for e¤ects of other asset prices and interest rates than the
short nominal interest rate, in particular long bond rates. However, if this is the reason for a
direct money e¤ect, including those asset prices and interest rates explicitly would seem more
satisfactory. In our case, a long rate is already included via the variable ½t , and among other
potential other asset prices at least the exchange rate is already included. For this reason, I
choose not to include a separate direct-money channel to aggregate demand here.28

29

2.4. A binding zero bound
Let us now consider the transmission mechanism when the zero bound (2.12) is taken into
account and sometimes binds. Consider a situation where the zero bound is binding, in the
sense that (2.28) implies a negative interest rate. This could, for instance, be the result of a
series of negative demand shocks, which would call for expansionary monetary policy. If the
usual instrument rate hits the zero bound, are there any other expansionary monetary policy
actions available, or does monetary policy become ine¤ective and the central bank can only
wait for better times? Several potential actions have been discussed in the literature (see the
references in footnote 1).
In the model above, it is ½t and even ½t+1jt that matter, rather than rt . If there are expectations of the nominal interest rate becoming positive in the future, the central bank may try to
commit (as suggested by Orphanides and Wieland [54]) to maintaining the nominal interest rate
at zero for longer than so far expected by the private sector . If this commitment is credible, this
will shift expectations of future nominal rates downward and, at unchanged in‡ation expectations, expected future real rates downward to the same extent. This will reduce ½t and stimulate
the economy, everything else equal. However, absent any particular commitment mechanism,
the commitment may not be credible and interest rate expectations not much a¤ected.
Another action is further expansion of the monetary base, even when the short interest rate
has fallen to zero, along the lines of Meltzer [46] and [45]. But with a zero interest rate, short
28
Although admittedly, ½t , which is proportional to a long real rate, is determined by the simple expectations
hypothesis in (2.10). This may not do justice to Meltzer and Nelson; they may have in mind risk premia, a term
premium, for instance, that depend on real money via some portfolio-balance e¤ect.
29
The so-called P ¤ model is of a di¤erent category (see Hallman, Porter and Small [27], Tödter and Reimers
[68] and Svensson [64]). Here, the price gap (the current price level less the prive-level in long-run equilibrium
with an unchanged broad money stock) or, equivalently (with a change of sign), the real money gap (current real
broad money less real broad money in a long-run equilibrium) enters into a traditional accelerationist Phillips
curve in the place of the output gap. Although there is some empirical support for the P ¤ model (see Hallman,
Porter and Small [27], Tödter and Reimers [68] and Gerlach and Svensson [25]), absent any microfoundations,
this empirical support is di¢cult to interpret. As shown in Rudebusch and Svensson [58], the real money gap and
the output gap may be highly correlated, in which case the real money gap may enter as a proxy for the output
gap. Therefore, I do not incorporate the P ¤ model here.

government bonds would be more or less perfect substitutes for reserves, so it is not clear that
the private sector holding more money and less short government bonds would have much e¤ect
on other asset prices, including the exchange rate, unless a further expansion of the monetary
base somehow a¤ects in‡ation and exchange-rate expectations. Meltzer actually suggests openmarket operations in other assets than short government bonds, in order to a¤ect other asset
prices, notably the exchange rate, via imperfect substitutability and portfolio-balance e¤ects.
One possibility is to do open-market operations in longer government bonds and, in this
way try, to reduce long nominal and real interest rates (also suggested by Lebow [36]). If
this works, it is either because this action reduces expectations of future nominal rates (under
the expectations hypothesis) or because the relation between long and short rates involves risk
premia, term premia (not included in the model above), that depend on outstanding stocks of
longs bonds via a portfolio-balance e¤ect that can be exploited by the central bank. A third
possibility is that such open-market operations increase in‡ation expectations and thus lowers
½t .
Naturally, rt and ½t are not the only interest rates in a more elaborate setting, there is a
whole spectrum of rates on corporate bonds and loans which are, in equilibrium, higher than the
government bond rates because of some default risk. Thus, the central bank can, in principle,
do open-market operations in corporate bonds and even open a window and lend directly to
the private sector and thereby lower these rates and stimulate the economy. Since buying these
bonds and making these loans means taking on some risk, the central bank is subsidizing this
risk, so such actions have elements of …scal policy in them. This can also be interpreted as an
attempt to exploit the credit channel, by making some …rms less dependent on their balance
sheet to obtain loans and e¤ectively lowering their external-…nance premium.
Suppose current and expected future nominal rates cannot be further a¤ected. If the central
bank can increase the real exchange rate, that is, cause a real depreciation of the currency,
it can still stimulate aggregate demand and in‡ation via the exchange-rate channels discussed
above. Can the central bank a¤ect the exchange rate when the nominal interest rate is zero?
McCallum [39] has argued that foreign-exchange interventions can still a¤ect the exchange rate,
even if interest rates are zero. If the real exchange rate ful…lls the interest-rate parity condition
(2.15) with an exogenous foreign-exchange risk premium, 't , as in (2.20), the real exchange rate
can only be a¤ected if ½t is a¤ected. If the central bank cannot a¤ect current and expected
nominal interest rates and expected in‡ation, it cannot a¤ect ½t and hence, not qt . However,

18

suppose that the foreign-exchange risk premium 't is partly endogenous and in the simplest
possible case via a portfolio-balance e¤ect a¤ected by relative holdings domestic- and foreigncurrency assets. Then, instead of (2.20) we might have
¹ t;
't = Ã(bt ¡ b¤t ¡ st ) + '
¹ ) + » ';t+1 ;
¹ + ° ' (¹
't ¡ '
'
¹t = '
where bt and b¤t are private (log) holdings of domestic- and foreign-currency nominated assets
(including currency), respectively, Ã is a positive constant, and '
¹ t is the exogenous component
of the foreign-exchange risk premium. Then, foreign-exchange interventions that change the
relative holdings of domestic- and foreign-currency nominated assets would a¤ect the nominal
and real exchange rate. McCallum does not provide any calibration of the parameters or discuss
the magnitude of interventions needed to a¤ect the foreign-exchange risk premium, though.
Again, aggressive foreign-exchange interventions might a¤ect exchange-rate expectations and
thus a¤ect the current exchange rate, even in the absence of a portfolio-balance e¤ect.
I have already referred to private sector expectations and several expectations channels in the
transmission mechanism several times. More speci…cally, if the central bank can somehow a¤ect
private-sector expectations of future in‡ation, everything else equal it will be reducing expected
future real interest rates, reduce current and expected future real rates, increase (depreciate) the
current and expected future exchange rate, increase actual future output, and increase actual
future in‡ation. Krugman [33], who has strongly emphasized the role of expectations in getting
out of a zero-bound situation (a temporary liquidity trap), has stated that the central bank
should “credibly promise to be irresponsible.” In less striking but more precise words, the
central bank should attempt to restore in‡ation expectations to a sound positive level, more
precisely to its in‡ation target, ¼
^ > 0. That is, it should credibly promise to be responsible and
bring the in‡ation back to its target.
Although any increase in private in‡ation expectations would be helpful in the short run,
as emphasized by Posen [55] it is advantageous to anchor in‡ation expectations to a suitable
in‡ation target, that is, getting a credible in‡ation target. This should help avoiding the opposite
problem, getting too high and/or unstable in‡ation expectations and risking a change to a high,
unstable and uncertain in‡ation rate. For Japan, Krugman [33] has suggested a 4 percent
in‡ation target for 15 years. A more moderate target may be more credible, in the sense of
it being more desirable to keep it unchanged after having escaped from the liquidity trap. For
19

Japan, Posen [55] has suggested an initial in‡ation target of 3 percent, to be reduced to 2 percent
within a few speci…ed years.
An announcement is not likely to be enough, though. Setting up the whole in‡ation-targeting
framework, with published in‡ation forecasts, transparent in‡ation reports, etc., is a more serious commitment. Acting accordingly, motivating the interventions, explaining the role of the
emergency measures used, etc., is then a natural ingredient in building credibility for the in‡ation
target and getting rid of de‡ationary expectations.
A price-level target (path) corresponding to a positive long-run in‡ation (say 2 percent),
may, if it can be made credible, have special advantages. With a credible price-level target,
some de‡ation would, by itself, increase expected future in‡ation, and hence reduce real interest
rates and cause a real depreciation of the currency, even if nominal interest rates are unchanged.
Furthermore, long-run in‡ation expectations would not depend on whether the price-level target
will be missed in the near future.30
Although a number of potential monetary-policy actions have been suggested for a situation
with a liquidity trap and a binding zero bound, there remains considerable uncertainty about
how e¤ective they might be, especially when they rely on portfolio-balance e¤ects of uncertain
magnitude. None of them seem to be foolproof ways of escaping from a liquidity trap. In
particular, although a credible positive in‡ation target or a credible price-level target path
would clearly be very desirable, and by itself stimulate the economy in a liquidity trap via the
expectations channels, it is not clear how e¤ective actions to establish such credibility would be,
at least in the short run.
Fortunately, for an open economy, there seems to be a foolproof way of escaping from a
liquidity trap.

3. A foolproof way of escaping from a liquidity trap
Let us now consider an open economy in the above model in an initial liquidity trap. The
zero bound is binding, so short nominal interest rates are zero. Expected domestic in‡ation is
negative, so the real interest rate is positive. The economy is in recession and the current output
gap is negative. Expectations and forecasts point to continued de‡ation and a negative output
30

It is an open question whether, away from the zero bound, in‡ation targeting or price-level targeting is the
preferred policy. Conventional wisdom has been that price-level targeting would imply more short-term in‡ation
variability and/or output-gap variability. This conventional wisdom has recently been challenged by Svensson
[62], Woodford [77], Vestin [72], King [32] and Batini and Yates [5], where it is shown that di¤erent forms of
price-level targeting may very well reduce short-term in‡ation and/or output-gap variability.

20

gap for some time ahead. The nominal interest rate is lower than in the rest of the world so,
to the extent uncovered interest parity holds, the domestic currency is expected to appreciate.
Flexible in‡ation targeting with a small positive in‡ation target and some weight on stabilizing
output around potential output calls for a more expansionary monetary policy and a lower real
interest rate, but the central bank is prevented from lowering its instrument rate by the zero
bound.
3.1. The foolproof way
I would like to suggest that there is indeed a foolproof way of implementing a more expansionary
monetary policy and escaping from such a liquidity trap. This involves introducing a price-level
target path corresponding to a small positive long-run in‡ation target and jump-starting the
economy by a devaluation of the currency and temporary exchange-rate peg. More precisely, a
central bank that wants to escape from the liquidity trap should:
(1) Announce an upward-sloping price-level target path f^
pt g1
t=t0 for the domestic price level,
^ (t ¡ t0 ); t ¸ t0 ;
p^t = p^t0 + ¼

(3.1)

with the price-level target for the current period t0 exceeding the current price level,
p^t0 > pt0 ;

(3.2)

and with a small positive long-run in‡ation target (for instance, 2 percent per year),
¼
^ > 0:
(2a) Announce that the currency will be devalued and that the exchange rate will be pegged
to a crawling exchange-rate target,
st = s¹t ; t ¸ t0 ;

(3.3)

where the exchange-rate target s¹t is given by
¼ ¡ ¼¤ )(t ¡ t0 ); t ¸ t0 :
s¹t = s¹t0 + (^

(3.4)

That is, the central bank makes a commitment to buy and sell unlimited amounts of foreign
currency at the exchange rate s¹t . The initial exchange-rate target after the devaluation, s¹t0 , is
chosen such that there is real depreciation of the domestic currency relative to the steady state,
qt0 ´ p¤t0 + s¹t0 ¡ pt0 > q
21

(3.5)

(recall that the domestic price level is sticky, so that in the short run, the real exchange rate
moves one-to-one with the nominal exchange rate). The exchange-rate target then corresponds
to a nominal depreciation of the domestic currency at the rate of the di¤erence between the
^ < ¼¤ , there is a
domestic in‡ation target and average foreign in‡ation, ¼
^ ¡ ¼¤ . That is, if ¼
nominal appreciation, and if ¼
^ = ¼¤ , the peg is …xed instead of crawling.
(2b) Announce that, when the price-level target path has been reached, the peg will be
abandoned, either in favor of ‡exible price-level targeting with the same target path, that is,
with a period loss function given by
1
Lt = [(pt ¡ p^t )2 + ¸yt2 ];
2

(3.6)

or in favor of ‡exible in‡ation-targeting with the same in‡ation target, that is, with a period
loss function given by (2.22). Which alternative is announced would be determined by whether
a price-level targeting without base drift of the price level or in‡ation targeting with such base
drift is preferred in the long run.31

32

(3) Then, just do it.
3.2. Why would this work?
Why would this work? The argument proceeds in several steps, to be explained in detail below:
(i) It is technically feasible for the central bank to devalue the currency and peg the exchange
rate at a level corresponding to an initial real depreciation of the domestic currency relative
to the steady state. (ii) If the central bank demonstrates that it both can and wants to hold
the peg, the peg will be credible. That is, the private sector will expect the peg to hold in the
future. (iii) When the peg is credible, the central bank has to raise the short nominal interest
rate above the zero bound to a level corresponding to uncovered interest rate parity. Thus, the
economy is formally out of the liquidity trap. In spite of the rise of the nominal interest rate,
the long real rate falls, as we shall see. (iv) Since the initial real exchange rate corresponds to a
real depreciation of the domestic currency relative to the steady state, the private sector must
expect a real appreciation eventually. (v) Expected real appreciation of the currency implies, by
31

The central bank may also announce that it wants to shift to targeting the CPI level or in‡ation rather than
domestic price level or in‡ation. Escaping from the liquidity trap is more easily discussed in terms of the domestic
price level, though.
32
Flexible price-level targeting without base drift in the price level would correspond to the period loss
function (3.6) rather than (2.22). With such a loss function, the model can be expressed in the state-space
form (2.24)–2.26), with the vectors of predetermined variables, target variables and target levels de…ned as
Xt ´ (¼ t ; yt ; ¼ ¤t ¡ ¼ ¤ ; yt¤ ; i¤t ¡ i¤ ; 't ¡ '; ytn ; qt¡1 ¡ q; pt¡1 ¡ p^t¡1 ; p^t ), Yt ´ (pt ¡ p^t ; yt )0 and Y^t ´ (0; 0)0 . That is,
the domestic price level and the price-level target are additional predetermined variables.

22

real interest parity (2.15) and (2.16), that the long real interest rate is lower. (vi) Furthermore,
given the particular crawling peg (3.4), a real appreciation of the domestic currency will arise
only if domestic in‡ation exceeds the in‡ation target. Therefore, the private sector must expect
in‡ation to eventually rise and even exceed the in‡ation target.
(vii) The economy is hence jump-started by (a) a real depreciation of the domestic currency,
(b) a lower long real interest rate and (c) increased in‡ation expectations. Via the transmission
channels discussed in section 2, the output gap will rise because of (a) and (b). In‡ation will
increase above the in‡ation target by (a), (c) and the increase in the output gap, and thus
induce a real appreciation of the domestic currency. (viii) With actual in‡ation above the
in‡ation target, the price level will eventually catch up with the price-level target path. (ix)
When the price-level target path has been reached, the peg will be abandoned, and monetary
policy shifts to ‡exible price-level targeting or ‡exible in‡ation targeting, depending on what
has previously been announced.
Let me explain this argument in more detail. With regard to step (i), it is indeed possible for
the central bank to devalue the domestic currency and peg the nominal exchange rate at a level
corresponding to a real depreciation relative to the steady state. The central bank will make a
commitment to buy and sell unlimited amounts of domestic currency for foreign currency at the
target exchange rate. Since the currency has been devalued so as to achieve a real depreciation
relative to the steady state, the currency will be strong in the sense of there being appreciation
pressure. Thus, the domestic currency will be in demand, and the central bank can always
ful…ll that demand by issuing enough volumes of domestic currency. The central bank’s foreignexchange reserves will rise, but this is not a problem in a situation when the central bank wants
in‡ation and in‡ation expectations to pick up.
In contrast, a central bank defending a weak currency, in the sense of there being depreciation
pressure, would be buying the domestic currency and paying with its foreign-exchange reserves,
eventually risking running out of foreign-exchange reserves and having to ‡oat the currency.
There is indeed a big di¤erence between defending a strong currency and a weak one, since by
issuing more domestic currency and allowing foreign-exchange reserves to grow without bounds,
the strong currency can be defended inde…nitely. There are many examples of central banks
pegging a weak currency being overwhelmed by speculative attacks, and having to ‡oat because
they have run out of foreign-exchange reserves or because the level of domestic interest rates

23

needed to stop the onslaught are too costly to be credible.33 In contrast, a central bank pegging
a strong currency would only abandon the peg by choice, if the size of the foreign-exchange
reserves and the stock of money become too in‡ationary or the low interest rate to counter the
appreciation pressure is too expansionary and causes the economy to overheat. This is obviously
not the situation for an economy in a liquidity trap. When in‡ation and activity starts picking
up, the price-level will eventually hit the price-level target path, and the peg will be abandoned.
The idea is that the price-level target shall be met before the economy has become dangerously
overheated.
Note that the argument does not depend on any portfolio-balance e¤ects of foreign-exchange
interventions, in contrast to the argument of Meltzer [46] and McCallum [39], and thus, it is
more general. Indeed, we can assume that there is no portfolio-balance e¤ect and that uncovered
interest parity (2.14) holds, with an exogenous or even zero foreign-exchange risk premium.
As long as the central bank supplies an unlimited amount of domestic currency at the target
exchange rate s¹t , arbitrage in the foreign-exchange market will ensure that this exchange rate
is the equilibrium exchange rate.34 Alternatively, as discussed in appendix B, one can think of
the temporary peg as supported by a threat of foreign-exchange interventions of huge volumes,
at which a portfolio-balance e¤ect would realistically appear and depreciate the currency. This
threat excludes the possibility that the peg would fail.
With regard to step (ii), if the central bank thus demonstrates that it can hold the peg, the
peg will become credible. That is, private-sector exchange-rate expectations will ful…ll
st+¿ jt = s¹t+¿ ; ¿ ¸ 0

(3.7)

With regard to step (iii), combining (3.7) with (3.4), we have that private-sector exchange-rate
expectations ful…ll
st+1jt = st + ¼
^ ¡ ¼¤ :

(3.8)

Together with (2.14), this implies that the equilibrium interest rate will no longer be zero but
rise to ful…ll
it = i¤t + ¼
^ ¡ ¼¤ + 't ;
33

(3.9)

See, for instance, Svensson [60] for more discussion.
If there is a portfolio-balance e¤ect and sterilized interventions are e¤ective, the central bank will the have
a choice between nonsterilized interventions, which amounts to buying foreign-exchange reserves and paying in
domestic currency; thus see the monetary base rise with the foreign-exchange reserves, or sterilized interventions,
which amount to selling domestic bonds for the foreign-exchange reserves (that is, reducing domestic credit)
and keep the monetary base constant. However, the central bank might run out of domestic credit, in which
case it would have to switch to nonsterilized interventions. Since the central bank always has the option to use
nonsterilized interventions by issuing more currency, it can always ful…ll the demand for the currency.
34

24

and the zero bound is no longer binding (I assume that i¤t + ¼
^ ¡ ¼¤ + 't > 0). That is, when
the peg becomes credible, if the central bank sets the interest rate equal to (3.9), domestic
and foreign investors are indi¤erent between holding domestic-currency and foreign-currency
nominated short bonds, and the central bank need no longer intervene on the foreign-exchange
market to support the exchange-rate peg. Then, the monetary base will be demand-determined,
at the interest rate given by (3.9). Appendix A supplies some further details on the establishment
of the peg.35
At …rst thought, we might think that the rise in the nominal interest rate to (3.9) implies
that the real interest rate has increased and monetary policy may not necessarily have become
more expansionary, when the e¤ect of both the real interest rate and the real exchange rate are
taken into account.36 As we shall see, however, increased in‡ation expectations dominate over
the rise in the nominal rate.
Indeed, because the initial real exchange rate corresponds to a real depreciation relative to
the steady state, (3.5), a real appreciation of the domestic currency must eventually occur, and
the private sector must expect it to eventually occur, step (iv) above. Furthermore, by (2.16),
we see that the real depreciation relative to the steady state implies a low ½t relative to ½¤t .
Thus, we have demonstrated step (v), that the long real interest rates is lower.
With regard to step (vi), if the peg holds, by (2.5), (3.3) and (3.4), we have
^ ) + (¼¤t+1 ¡ ¼¤ ).
qt+1 ¡ qt = ¡ (¼t+1 ¡ ¼

(3.10)

For simplicity, let me temporarily take foreign in‡ation to be deterministic and constant, so that
¼ ¤t+1 ´ ¼¤

(3.11)

(that is, I assume that ° ¤¼ = 0 and "¤t ´ 0 in (2.18); the more general case with (2.18) and base
drift in the foreign price level is discussed in appendix C). Then, we have
qt+1 ¡ qt = ¡ (¼t+1 ¡ ¼
^ );

(3.12)

so a real appreciation of the domestic currency occurs only if domestic in‡ation exceeds the
in‡ation target. When the peg is credible, (3.7), this means that the private sector must expect
35
A rise in short and long nominal interest rates implies capital losses for holders of government bonds and
corresponding gains for the government. If these losses are a problem, they can obviously be undone by adjustment
of the coupon on government bonds.
36
Blinder [11], in his comments at the conference “Monetary Policy in a Low In‡ation Environment,” October
1999, in reference to an intervention from the ‡oor by Dale Henderson suggesting a peg of the yen, observes that
the nominal interest rate would then rise to the level of the foreign interest rate and concludes that the increase
in the interest rate would imply a tightening of monetary policy.

25

in‡ation to eventually exceed the in‡ation target,
^ = ¡ (qt+¿ jt ¡ qt+¿ ¡1jt ) > 0;
¼t+¿ jt ¡ ¼

(3.13)

for some ¿ ¸ 1, and step (vi) has been demonstrated.
Thus, in step (vii), monetary policy is indeed expansionary, and the economy is jump-started
by (a) a real depreciation of the domestic currency relative to the steady state, (b) a lower long
real interest rate and (c) increased in‡ation expectations.
With regard to step (viii), we have already noted that a real appreciation (after the initial
real depreciation) of the domestic currency implies that domestic in‡ation is higher than the
in‡ation target. Thus, we know that the price level is approaching the price-level target path
from below. Do we know that the price level will actually hit the price-level target path in …nite
time?
Suppose the exchange-rate peg would be maintained forever, and consider the steady-state
domestic price-level path, f¹
pt g1
t=t0 , that is consistent with the exchange-rate peg. It is given by
p¹t ´ p¤t + s¹t ¡ q
^ (t ¡ t0 );
= p¤t0 + s¹t0 ¡ q + ¼

(3.14)
(3.15)

where I have used (2.8), (3.1), (3.3) and (3.11). We realize that if this steady-state price-level
path is above the price-level target path,
p¹t > p^t ;

(3.16)

the price-level target will be reached in …nite time. Furthermore, from (3.1) and (3.15), we have
p¹t ¡ p^t = p¤t0 + s¹t0 ¡ q ¡ p^t0
´ (qt0 ¡ q) ¡ (^
pt0 ¡ pt0 ):
Thus, in order for (3.16) to be ful…lled, we must have
qt0 ¡ q > p^t0 ¡ pt0 > 0;
where the last inequality restates (3.2).
Thus, the central bank wants the initial devaluation to cause a real depreciation relative to
the steady state that is larger than the di¤erence between the initial price-level target and the

26

initial price level. The central bank can use the initial real depreciation relative to the steadystate level, qt0 ¡q, as a measure of the extent to which monetary policy is initially expansionary.37
The di¤erence between the price-level target and the initial price-level, p^t0 ¡pt0 , will be a measure
of how much the economy is intended to in‡ate and expand before the price-level target is hit;
that is, how much of the “price gap” caused by several years of zero or negative in‡ation that
the central bank intends to undo. For a given initial depreciation relative to the steady state
(qt0 ¡ q), the price-level target will be hit sooner the smaller the di¤erence p^t0 ¡ pt0 . For a given
di¤erence p^t0 ¡ pt0 , the economy will hit the price-level target sooner and with higher activity
and in‡ation, the larger the initial real depreciation relative to steady state (qt0 ¡ q). Clearly,
a greater and quicker recovery from the liquidity trap runs the risk of overheating the economy
before or as the price-level target is being hit.38
3.3. The roles of the price-level target path and the exchange-rate peg
The role of the price-level target path is to provide the best nominal anchor for the economy.
Once credible, a price-level target implies that long-run in‡ation expectations are independent
of in‡ation the …rst few periods, and even that a few periods of de‡ation increases in‡ation
expectations for the near future, thus providing automatic stimulation of the economy. Furthermore, the uncertainty about long-run in‡ation falls with the horizon. The di¤erence between the
initial price-level target from the initial price level provides a measure of how much accumulated
above-normal future in‡ation the central bank wants, that is, how much of the price gap it wants
to undo. The price-level target path also provides a well-de…ned criterion for abandoning the
peg when the latter has done its work.
The role of the devaluation and peg corresponding to a real depreciation relative to the
steady-state level is to jump-start the economy out of the liquidity trap. The di¤erence between
the initial real exchange rate after the devaluation and either the steady-state level of the
exchange rate or the initial real exchange rate before the devaluation provides a measure of
the magnitude of the jump-start, the initial boost to the economy.39
37
Letting the real exchange rate in the liquidity trap immediately before the announcement be denoted by
qt0 ¡ , we can use the di¤erence qt0 ¡ qt0 ¡ ´ st0 ¡ st0 ¡ as (one measure of) the change in monetary policy with
the new policy, the boost to the economy.
38
Obviously, the precise path of the economy can be characterized more explicitly, for instance by simulations
of the model.
39
The price-level target path and the peg that is maintained until the price-level target path is reached makes
the foolproof way di¤er from Feldstein’s [21] proposal (see footnotes 4 and 7). Feldstein suggests an initial
depreciation followed by a gradual nominal appreciation: “The Japanese government could add that it recognizes
that such an exchange rate cannot last inde…nitely and that it expects to permit the yen to rise at, say, 8% a year,
reaching 129 after one year, 119 after two years and so on until the currency reaches a level at which intervention

27

3.4. The central bank’s balance sheet
What are the balance-sheet consequences for the central bank of this policy? The initial devaluation will give the central bank a capital gain on (the domestic-currency value of) its initial
foreign-exchange reserves. While defending the peg in the initial phase, the central bank acquires
foreign-currency denominated assets with a depreciated domestic currency, at the exchange rate
s¹t0 . The extent to which the central bank’s foreign-exchange reserves will rise initially depends
on how long and how massive foreign-exchange interventions it takes to gain credibility for the
peg. Once credibility has been achieved and the domestic interest rate has risen to (3.9), the
money base will be demand-determined, and the domestic-currency return on foreign-exchange
reserves equals (3.9). Thus, initial capital gain on the foreign-exchange reserves is the main
balance-sheet consequence for the central bank. Appendix A provides further details on the
initial currency ‡ows.

4. Conclusions for Japan
The monetary policy of Bank of Japan is very controversial. A number of economists, including
Bernanke [8], Blinder [11], Fedstein [21], Ito [31], Krugman [33], McCallum [39], Meltzer [43][46], Mussa [47], Posen [55] and Svensson [63] have suggested monetary policy actions and
changes that may improve the economic situation in Japan. In particular, Bernanke, Krugman,
Meltzer and Posen have contributed more detailed arguments, criticism and suggestions. In
contrast, responses from Bank of Japan, including Okina [50] and [52] and Ueda [69] and [70],
have consistently defended a policy of not taking any actions beyond lowering the instrument
rate to zero.
The gist of the Bank of Japan argument, as far as I can see, seems to be that, since one cannot
be absolutely sure that any given policy action or change in the monetary policy regime will
succeed in getting the economy out of the liquidity trap, it is safer not to try. The logic of this
argument escapes me. Instead, as argued in Svensson [63], it seems that, if a monetary expansion
is deemed desirable, prudent policy calls for trying a number of the suggested remedies (as long
as they are not inconsistent), in the hope that some may work. Some of the Bank of Japan
arguments for no further action have pointed to potential negative consequences for its balance
sheet and that the responsibility for foreign-exchange interventions rests with the Ministry of
is no longer needed.” With a gradual nominal appreciation, in‡ation and in‡ation expectations would not be
generated to the same extent, or not at all.

28

Finance. This seems like setting myopic bureaucratic interests and technical details above the
welfare of the country, in a situation where leadership and resolve is called for (see Bernanke
[8]).
Now, there is an additional possibility for Bank of Japan (and the Ministry of Finance): a
foolproof way of escaping from its liquidity trap and recession, namely combining a price-level
target path corresponding to positive in‡ation with a devaluation of the yen and a temporary
exchange-rate peg to jump-start the economy. Exchange-rate policy and monetary policy cannot
be separated under free international capital mobility, since exchange rates and interest rates
cannot then be set independently. Nevertheless, many countries, including Japan, have the
inconsistent institutional setup that exchange-rate policy is the responsibility of the government,
via the ministry of …nance, rather than the responsibility of the central bank. For Japan, I
understand that the Bank of Japan is not allowed to undertake independent foreign-exchange
interventions in order to a¤ect the exchange rate. Given this, the temporary exchange-rate peg
required for the foolproof way of escaping a liquidity trap requires an explicit agreement between
Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance. When the welfare of the country is at stake, it
would seem that such an agreement should not be di¢cult to conclude.40
Given the discussion in Okina [50]-[52] and Ueda [69] and [70], if a monetary expansion is
deemed desirable, what objections might Bank of Japan still have to the foolproof way? The
proposal of Krugman [33] and others of a positive in‡ation target has been rejected by Bank of
Japan with the argument that the proposal does not in itself suggest any means for the Bank
of Japan to achieve the in‡ation target. Regardless of the validity of this argument, it does
not apply to the foolproof way with its price-level target path, since the foolproof way suggests
a very speci…c means to achieve the price-level target, namely the temporary exchange-rate
peg. With regard to the proposal by Meltzer [46], McCallum [39] and others to depreciate
the yen, Okina [50]-[52] emphasizes that it is the Ministry of Finance and not Bank of Japan
that is responsible for exchange-rate policy, seems to agree that unlimited foreign-exchange
40
Since the net balance-sheet consequences for Bank of Japan of the proposed way of escaping from the liquidity
trap seem to be positive, they provide no reason for Bank of Japan objections. The Bank of Japan Law has the
asymmetric provision that Bank of Japan pro…ts are delivered to the Government whereas losses are born by
the Bank (see Okina [50]). Because of this, Bank of Japan has resisted proposals to buy long-term government
bonds, since it would su¤er capital losses when long-term bond rates rise to normal levels (even though these
losses would correspond one-for-one to Government capital gains). It may be advantageous, as suggested by
Bernanke [8], to revise the law to put Bank of Japan on a …xed operating allowance and make the Government
the residual claimant of gains and losses to the Bank’s balance sheet. Before such a revision, it would seem that an
agreement with the Ministry of Finance on how to escape from the liquidity trap could also include a Government
guarantee to cover any capital losses encountered by the Bank. To most observers, it of course seems bizarre if
minor balance-sheet consequences (especially if they cancel between the Bank and the Government) are allowed
to stand in the way of the welfare of the country.

interventions (in cooperation between Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance) to achieve a
target exchange rate would work, but warns that “given that the ‡oating exchange rate system
has prevailed among industrialized countries for quite a long time, any attempt at unlimited
intervention to bring the foreign exchange rate back to something akin to a …xed exchange
rate regime would be a grand experiment” [51, p. 196] (probably meaning “too grand an
experiment”). This argument (again regardless of its validity) does not seem to apply to the
foolproof way, since that is for a temporary devaluation and exchange-rate peg to achieve the
price-level target and not a permanent shift to a …xed exchange-rate regime (as proposed by
McKinnon [41] and [42]).
One possible objection to the foolproof way is that it is similar to a competitive devaluation,
and that trading partners may have objections. First, one can observe that, due to (2.16),
any monetary expansion that results in a lower long real interest rate must in equilibrium be
associated with a real depreciation. Hence, if one objects to any real depreciation, one essentially
objects to any monetary expansion. Second, jump-starting the Japanese economy should sooner
or later increase Japanese demand for import from the rest of the world. As is well known, the
current account e¤ects of a devaluation are generally ambiguous, with substitution and income
e¤ects of opposite signs. To most observers, it seems rather uncontroversial that Japanese, Asian
and world welfare would all be well served by an expansion of the Japanese economy.41
41
At the time of writing, the o¢cial view of Bank of Japan is that the Japanese economy has improved to such
an extent that any further monetary expansion is not needed, and Bank of Japan has just (defying practically
all external advice, including IMF [30]) taken the very controversial action of raising the interest rate above zero,
stating that “de‡ationary concern has been dispelled” (Bank of Japan [3]) without reference to forecasts of the
CPI or GDP-de‡ator and in spite of current de‡ation in these price indices.

A. Devaluing the currency and establishing the peg
This appendix discusses the establishment of the temporary peg in some detail.
A.1. Before the peg
In the initial situation, before the devaluation, we have a zero interest rate (it = 0), a clean ‡oat
and, by (2.14),
st+1jt ¡ st = ¡ i¤t < 0;

(A.1)

where I for simplicity set the foreign-exchange risk premium equal to zero ('t ´ 0). That
is, the currency is expected to appreciate at a rate equal to the foreign interest rate. The
foreign-exchange market is in equilibrium and there are no foreign-exchange interventions. The
expected domestic-currency (one-period) return on foreign(-currency one-period) bonds equals
the zero domestic-currency (one-period) return on domestic(-currency one-period) bonds. Let
t0 ¡ denote the “beginning” of period t0 , before the (unanticipated) announcement of the
devaluation and the peg, so the initial exchange rate, st0 ¡ , and exchange rate expectations,
st0 +1jt0 ¡ , in the beginning of period t0 ful…ll
st0 +1jt0 ¡ ¡ st0 ¡ + i¤t0 = 0;
hence making the expected one-period domestic-currency return on foreign bonds equal to zero.
A.2. Initial lack of credibility of the peg
Let t0 denote the “middle” of period t0 , after the announcement of the devaluation and the central bank’s commitment to buy and sell unlimited amounts of foreign exchange at the exchange
rate s¹t0 > st0 ¡ . Suppose that the peg is not credible. More precisely, suppose that expectations
of the period-t0 + 1 exchange rate remain the same, so st0 +1 = st0 +1jt0 ¡ . Let the domestic
interest rate be held at zero. Then the expected one-period domestic-currency return on foreign
bonds at the exchange rate s¹t0 ful…lls
st0 +1jt0 ¡ s¹t0 + i¤t0 < 0;
so the expected one-period domestic-currency return on foreign bonds is less than the return on
domestic bonds. Then there will be excess demand for domestic currency and excess supply of
foreign currency. The central bank then intervenes and equilibrates the foreign-exchange market
31

at the exchange rate s¹t0 by supplying the corresponding amount of domestic currency, thereby
adding to its foreign-exchange reserves. Arbitrage among foreign-exchange traders ensures that
the market exchange rate equals s¹t0 .
A.3. A credible peg and a zero interest rate
Next, suppose that the peg becomes credible, when the central bank has demonstrated that it
can ful…ll the excess demand for domestic currency, so exchange rate expectations ful…ll
st+1jt = s¹t+1jt
for t ¸ t0 . Suppose the interest rate is still held at zero. Then the expected one-period domesticcurrency return on foreign bonds in period t0 is by (3.4) given by
^ ¡ ¼¤ + i¤t0 > 0;
s¹t0 +1jt0 ¡ s¹t0 + i¤t0 = ¼
(where I again assume that ¼
^ ¡ ¼¤ + i¤t > 0). Now, the expected domestic-currency return on
foreign bonds has become positive and larger than the zero return on holding domestic bonds.
Then foreign exchange will be in excess demand and domestic currency will be in excess supply.
The central bank will have to intervene in the opposite direction, buying domestic currency and
selling foreign exchange. It will hence be reducing its foreign-exchange reserves and it will have
to raise the domestic interest rate before its foreign-exchange reserves are extinguished.
A.4. A credible peg and an equilibrium interest rate
So, let the central bank raise the domestic interest rate to equal
^ ¡ ¼¤ + i¤t
it = ¼
for t ¸ t0 (corresponding to (3.13) with 't ´ 0). Then the expected domestic-currency returns
on domestic and foreign bonds are equal, the foreign-exchange market is in equilibrium, and
no foreign-exchange interventions are needed. The total demand for base money will, in the
simplest case, be a function of and decreasing in the domestic interest rate and increasing in
the volume of transactions in domestic currency, which we assume depends on the output level.
Thus we can write
Mt
= g(it ; Ytd );
Pt

32

(A.2)

where Mt is the quantity of base money, Pt ´ ept is the absolute domestic price level and
d

Ytd ´ eyt is the level of real domestic output (aggregate demand). More precisely, the central
bank will be reducing the monetary base, via open-market operations or unsterilized foreignexchange interventions, so as to increase the interest rate to the equilibrium level. Furthermore,
the monetary base will equal the sum of the central bank’s holding of domestic bonds (domestic
credit), Dt , and the domestic-currency value of is holdings of foreign-currency bonds (foreignexchange reserves), Rt (measured in foreign currency),
Mt = Dt + S¹t Rt ;
where S¹t ´ es¹t is the absolute level of the exchange rate peg. Thus, although the total domestic
monetary base, as usual under an exchange rate peg, is given to the central bank by (A.2) in
equilibrium, the central bank can a¤ect the composition of the monetary base into domestic
credit and foreign-exchange reserves. For instance, in the previous stage A.3 (when the peg
is credible, the domestic interest rate is at zero (below the equilibrium level) and the central
bank is loosing foreign-exchange reserves) the central bank can time the increase in the interest
rate to the equilibrium level so as to be able to stop foreign-exchange intervention when the
foreign-exchange reserves have fallen to a desirable level.
A.5. Announcing the peg and increasing the interest rate simultaneously
Note that the central bank could in principle announce the peg and increase in the interest rate
at the same time. The expected domestic-currency excess return on foreign bonds would then,
at the pegged exchange rate, be given by
¼ ¡ ¼ ¤ ):
st0 +1jt0 ¡ s¹t0 + i¤t0 ¡ it0 = st0 +1jt0 ¡ s¹t0 ¡ (^
If the peg is not credible, so st0 +1jt0 < s¹t0 +1 , the excess return is negative, there will be excess
demand for domestic currency, and the central bank will intervene and increase its foreignexchange reserves. At the same time it will be doing open-market operations so as to reduce
the overall monetary base and increase the interest rate. When credibility of the peg has been
restored, it can stop intervening. How much foreign-exchange reserves have increased by then
depends on how quickly credibility of the peg is achieved. This may come very quickly, in which
case little foreign-exchange interventions may be needed. Alternatively, the foreign-exchange
reserves may have risen to a level larger than desirable, for instance, having replaced most of
33

domestic credit, which will require unwinding of the reserves over time. For this reason, it may
be preferable to follow the sequence A.2–A.4 above, and only increase the domestic interest rate
after credibility of the peg has been achieved.
A.6. Balance-sheet consequences
What are the balance-sheet consequences of the operations above. At the devaluation, the central
bank makes a capital gain on its initial foreign-exchange reserves, (S¹t0 ¡ St0 ¡ )Rt0 ¡ > 0. After

the devaluation, any foreign-exchange interventions are done at the pegged exchange rate S¹t ,

and domestic credit and foreign-exchange reserves earn the same return. When the temporary
peg is later abandoned, the central bank will make capital gains and losses if the exchange rate
jumps then. The magnitude of the capital gains and losses are then a¤ected by the volume of
foreign-exchange reserves, which is under control by the central bank.
A.7. An implicit short-run ‡ow model of the foreign-exchange market
Note that the discussion in sections A.1–A.5 above is consistent with an implicit short-term ‡ow
model of the foreign-exchange market, where the volume of foreign-exchange intervention (the
capital ‡ow) is proportional to the expected excess return on holding foreign-currency bonds,
st+1jt ¡ st + i¤t ¡ it = ¡ 't
't = Ã t (Rt ¡ Rt¡1 ) + '
¹ t;
where 't is the total foreign-exchange risk premium, the coe¢cient Ãt is positive and its de¹ t is an exogenous
pendence on t allows it to depend on the state of the economy (Xt ), and '
component of the total foreign-exchange risk premium.

B. The threat of huge foreign-exchange interventions42
Arguably, the temporary peg could fail in the following way. The central bank announces the
peg and commits to buying and selling unlimited amounts of foreign currency at the pegged rate,
s¹t . However, assume that there is in fact a large but …nite upper limit to how much domestic
currency the central bank is willing to issue, and that this is anticipated by the market. Then,
one possible equilibrium would seem to be that the foreign-exchange market just absorbs the
increased supply of domestic currency up to the central bank’s limit, after which the central
42

I have bene…tted from comments by Michael Woodford on this issue.

34

bank abandons the attempt to defend the peg. The domestic currency never depreciates to the
desired peg and continues to ‡oat after the defence of the peg is abandoned. If domestic currency
is a perfect substitute for foreign(-currency denominated) assets, the exchange rate would even
follow exactly the same path, corresponding to (A.1), as followed if the central bank had never
attempted to institute the peg. The foreign-exchange traders who bought the domestic currency
at the pegged price has made a good deal (and the central bank has su¤ered a corresponding
loss), but otherwise nothing has changed (obviously I am disregarding the …scal consequences
of the central bank’s loss and the wealth e¤ects of the traders’ gains).
If the limit is small, the above is of course the likely scenario. However, if the limit is
very large, it is realistic at such volumes of currency issue that domestic currency would no
longer be a perfect substitute for foreign assets and some portfolio-balance e¤ect would appear
and depreciate the domestic currency, in which case the investors who just bought domestic
currency would su¤er losses. This would seem su¢cient to exclude the equilibrium where the
peg fails because the large issue of domestic currency is just absorbed by the foreign-exchange
market with no e¤ect on the exchange rate. Given this, the threat and any portfolio-balance
e¤ects need never materialize, and uncovered interest parity holds in the equilibrium with the
temporary peg.

C. Base drift in the foreign price level
Now, I allow ¼¤t+1 to be determined by (2.18) instead of (3.11), so that p¤t , given by (2.8), will
no longer be deterministic but include a unit root and hence, be integrated order one, I(1). In
particular, it follows from (2.8) and (2.18) that
t¡t

p¤t = p¤t0 + ¼ ¤ (t ¡ t0 ) +

(C.1)

Suppose that the central bank pursues the same foolproof policy (1)–(3) with the same price-level
target, (3.1), and the same peg, (3.3) and (3.4). Then, (3.10) implies
^ ) + (¼¤t+1 ¡ ¼¤ );
qt+1 ¡ qt = ¡(¼t+1 ¡ ¼
instead of (3.12). Thus, now
qt+¿ jt ¡ qt+¿ ¡1jt = ¡(¼t+¿ jt ¡ ¼¤ ) + (° ¤¼ )¿ (¼¤t ¡ ¼¤ ):
If the term (° ¤¼ )¿ (¼¤t ¡ ¼¤ ) is su¢ciently small, expected real appreciation would still approximately mean expected domestic in‡ation above the in‡ation target.
35

The domestic price-level consistent with the peg and the steady-state level of the real exchange rate, (3.14), is now
p¹t =

p¤t0

instead of (3.15). This will introduce the same base drift in p¹t and pt as in p¤t , which will
introduce more variability in the time required for the domestic price level to catch up with
the price-level target path. Unless foreign in‡ation is far o¤ its steady-state level or the shocks
to foreign in‡ation are large, if the catch-up would occur fairly soon in the absence of foreign
price-level drift, this base drift will not matter much.
We note that p¹t expected in period t0 , p¹tjt0 , ful…lls

p¹tjt0 ¡ p^t = (qt0 ¡ q) ¡ (^

Thus, to ensure that p¹t0 +T jt0 > p^T for some horizon T > 0, the initial devaluation should be
adjusted to ful…ll
qt0 ¡ q > p^t0 ¡ pt0 ¡

1 ¡ (° ¤¼ )T ¤ ¤
° (¼ ¡ ¼¤ ) > 0:
1 ¡ ° ¤¼ ¼ t0

That is, the initial devaluation should take into account the expected foreign price-level increase
in excess of that corresponding to average foreign in‡ation. This excess foreign price-level
increase is measured by the term
1 ¡ (° ¤¼ )T ¤ ¤
° (¼ ¡ ¼¤ ):
1 ¡ ° ¤¼ ¼ t0
Note that there is a more sophisticated crawling (and drifting) peg that compensates for the
base drift in the foreign price level. This would instead of (3.4) be
^ (t ¡ t0 ) ¡ p¤t :
s¹t = s¹t0 + ¼
With p¤t given by (C.1), this implies
s¹t = s¹t0 + (^
¼ ¡ ¼¤ )(t ¡ t0 ) +

(C.2)

Thus, this crawling and drifting peg di¤ers from the crawling peg (3.4) by the last two terms in
(C.2). With this peg, we would again have (3.12), (3.13) and (3.15), and no drift is introduced
into p¹t and pt during the peg.

36

D. Sticky initial de‡ation
I assume that the economy is initially in a liquidity trap with de‡ation, ¼t0 < 0. Given the
dependence of in‡ation on lagged in‡ation in (2.1), the de‡ation is sticky, and even if the
temporary peg immediately becomes credible, and the economy is jump-started, de‡ation may
continue for a few periods. Furthermore, it may take a few additional periods before in‡ation
is above the long-run in‡ation target, ¼
^ . During those periods, by (3.12), the real exchange
rate is depreciating further, increasing the expansionary e¤ect of the real exchange rate on the
output gap in (2.9) and in‡ation in (2.1). While there is de‡ation and expected de‡ation,
because the nominal interest rate has been increased from zero to (3.13), the short real interest
rate will be higher in the …rst few periods. This might seem to be contractionary. However,
the aggregate-demand relation (derived from a forward-looking …rst-order condition in Svensson
[61, appendix]) implies that it is the long real interest rate, corresponding to ½t , that matters
for aggregate demand. This long-real interest rate depends on the degree of real depreciation
relative to a long-run equilibrium, (2.16). Thus, a few periods of de‡ation and further real
depreciation lowers the long real interest rate further. Even though the …rst few periods’ short
real interest rates increase, future real interest rates decrease more due to increased in‡ation, so
the net e¤ect on the long real interest rate is a decrease.
