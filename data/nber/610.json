It emphasizes deadweight loss as the correct criterion of taxation evaluation, rather than merely output effects. Distributional issues are also discussed. Simulations are done for the Kemp-Roth tax reform proposals to calculate both revenue effects and changes in deadweight loss. Deadweight loss calculations are also done for an equal yield progressive linear income tax.\n\n",
