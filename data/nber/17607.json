    "abstract": "\n\nIn this essay I review Sylvia Nasar's long awaited new history of economics, Grand Pursuit.  I describe how the book is really an economic history of the period from 1850-1950, with distinguished economists' stories inserted in appropriate places.  Nasar's goal is to show how economists work, but also to show that they are people too--with more than enough warts and foibles to show they are human!  I contrast the general view of the role of economics in Grand Pursuit with Robert Heilbroner's remarkably different conception in The Worldly Philosophers.  I also discuss more generally the question of why economists might be interested in their history at all.\n\n",
