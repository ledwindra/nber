    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper tests traditional capital structure models against the alternative of a pecking order model of corporate financing.  The basic pecking order model, which predicts external debt financing driven by the internal financial deficit, has much greater explanatory power than a static trade-off model which predicts that each firm adjusts toward an optimal debt ratio.  We show that the power of some usual tests of the trade-off model is virtually nil.  We question whether the available empirical evidence supports the notion of an optimal debt ratio.\n\n",
