China and the TPP: A Numerical Simulation Assessment of the Effects Involved
Chunding Li and John Whalley
NBER Working Paper No. 18090
May 2012
JEL No. C68,F47,F53
ABSTRACT
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a new negotiation on cross border liberalization of goods and
service flows going beyond WTO disciplines and focused on issues such as regulation and border
controls. Though the US, Australia and other pacific countries are included, China is notable for its
exclusion from the process thus far. This paper uses numerical simulation methods to assess the potential
effects of a TPP agreement on China and the other participating countries. We use a numerical five-country
global general equilibrium model with trade costs and monetary structure incorporating inside money
to allow for impacts on trade imbalances. Trade costs are calculated using a method based on gravity
equations. Simulation results reveal that China will be hurt by TPP initiatives, but the negative effects
are relatively small given the geographical and commodity composition of China’s trade. Other non-TPP
countries will be hurt but member countries will all gain. Japan’s joining TPP would be beneficial
to both herself and all other TPP countries, but negative effects on China and other non-TPP countries
will increase further. If China takes part in TPP, it will increase China’s and other TPP countries’ gain,
but non-TPP countries will be hurt more. As a regional free trade arrangement, TPP effects are different
from global free trade effects which will benefit all countries (not just member countries) in the world,
and the positive effects of global free trade are stronger than TPP effects.

1. Introduction
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a proposed nine-country Asia-Pacific free
trade arrangement being negotiated among the United States (US), Australia, Brunei,
Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The aim is to go beyond
WTO liberalization and focus on issues of regulation and border controls. As such it
differs from tariff based liberalization in there being no revenues involved with the
border measures. They also compound with conventional tariffs. The intuition,
therefore, is that larger gains may accrue to the importing countries compared to
previously studied liberalization. The negotiating partners have agreed that this
proposed “living agreement” cover new trade topics and include new members that
are willing to adopt the proposed agreement’s higher standards. To that end, Japan,
Canada and Mexico all have stated that they would have an interest in joining the
negotiations. This free trade pact, even without Mexico and Canada, would affect 600
million people in countries that produce 20 trillion US$ of annual economic output
(COC, 2011).
As a big country in the Asia-Pacific area, China has not been invited to take part
in the TPP initiative. Here we analyze how a TPP arrangement could potentially affect
both China and other participating and non-participating countries if this proposal
resulted in a true free trade agreement (FTA) among participants. The answer to this
question is important for policy making and related research, and depends critically
both on the size of barriers involved and their negotiability. Present literature on TPP
3

is limited and is mostly analytical or simple newsletters and comments, such as
Williams (2012), James (2010), Lewis (2011), and Ezell and Atkinson (2011). Few
numerical methods have been used to capture potential TPP effects for other countries
and the whole world, except Petri et al (2011) and Itakura and Lee (2012). Our point
of departure is to use numerical general equilibrium simulation methods to explore
TPP effects on both China and other countries.
We use a five-country (China, US, Japan, other TPP countries and the rest of
world (ROW)) Armington type global general equilibrium model. Each country
produces two-goods (Tradable goods and Non-tradable goods) and has two-factors
(capital and labor). The model captures trade costs and uses a monetary structure of
inside money both so as to also endogenously determine trade imbalance effects from
the trade initiative and also allow calibration to a base case capturing China’s large
trade surplus. We use a trade cost calculation method that recognizes limitations of
data by using an estimation treatment that follows Wong (2012) and Novy (2008). We
capture endogenously determined trade imbalances by incorporating both current
consumption and expected future incremental consumption from saving into the
model using an analytical structure attributed to Patinkin (1947), also adopted in
Archibald and Lipsey (1960), and used more recently in Whalley et al (2011) and Li
and Whalley (2012). We calibrate the model to 2010 data and use counterfactual
simulations to explore TPP effects.
Our simulation results show, not surprisingly, that the TPP initiative will hurt
China, but these effects are relatively small under the present TPP proposal, and so
4

will not have large effects on China. Other non-TPP member countries will be hurt as
well. Total world production and welfare will increase under a TPP regional free trade
initiative and a TPP will benefit member countries and the effects are significant and
comparatively prominent. Among these TPP countries, other TPP countries (OTPPC)
in the model will gain proportionally more than the US from this regional
arrangement because of their large intra Pacific trade. We also evaluate a partial
non-tariff barriers elimination scenario as sensitivity analysis, and also change
elasticities and upper bound values in the monetary structure. Results suggest that our
simulation results are reasonably robust. We have also simulated the effects that could
follow if Japan joins the TPP, and find that these would be beneficial both for Japan
and for all other TPP countries, but the negative effect on non-TPP countries (like
China and ROW) would increase. We have also evaluated the scenario of China
joining the TPP, and find that China and other TPP countries will all gain, but
non-TPP countries will be hurt. We also compare TPP effects to global free trade
effects in the model, and find they are different. Firstly, global free trade benefits all
countries in the world, but TPP benefits just member countries; second, global free
trade positive effects are considerably higher than TPP free trade effects.
The remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows: Part 2 introduces the
TPP initiative and its development; Part 3 is the global general equilibrium model
specification; Part 4 is our calculation of trade costs and TPP barriers change; Part 5
presents data and reports parameters from calibration; Part 6 reports simulation results
for six different scenarios. The last part offers conclusions and remarks.

2. The TPP Initiative and Its Development
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), also known as the Trans-Pacific Strategic
Economic Partnership Agreement (TPPA), is a multilateral free trade agreement (FTA)
that aims to further liberalize the economies of the Asia-Pacific region. Current
negotiating partners include Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru,
Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam, a total of nine countries. Although all
original and negotiating parties are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC), the TPP is not an APEC initiative. However, it is considered to
be a step towards the proposed Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP), an
APEC initiative. The country member relationships between TPP and APEC are
shown in Figure 1.

The TPP grew out of the Pacific Three Closer Economic Partnership (P3-CEP).
Its negotiation was launched on the sidelines of the 2002 APEC Leaders’ Meeting in
Los Cabos, Mexico, by Chilean President Ricardo Lagos and Prime Ministers Goh
6

Chok Tong of Singapore and Helen Clark of New Zealand. Brunei first took part as a
full negotiating party in the fifth round of talks in April 2005, after which the trade
bloc became known as the Pacific-4 (P4). The objective of the original agreement was
to eliminate 90% of all tariffs between member countries by January 1, 2006, and
reduce all trade tariffs to zero by 2015. It was also to be a comprehensive agreement
covering all the main components of a free trade agreement, including trade in goods,
rules of origin, trade remedies, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers
to trade, trade in services, intellectual property, government procurement and
competition policy (Wikipedia, 2012).
After the P4 negotiations finished in 2005, its parties agreed to begin negotiating
on financial services and investment which were not covered by the original
agreement within two years of its entry into force. When these negotiations began in
March 2008, the US joined the group pending a decision on whether to participate in a
comprehensive negotiation for an expanded TPP agreement. In September 2008, the
US announced it would participate fully in the negotiations, and Australia, Peru, and
Viet Nam also joined (NZMFAT, 2012).
In November 2009, US President Obama affirmed that the US would engage with
TPP countries. Negotiations for an expanded agreement began in March 2010 (Figure
2). During the third round in Brunei in October 2010, Malaysia joined the
negotiations. Meanwhile, Japan, Canada and Mexico have all more recently expressed
an interest in joining the TPP negotiations. We report information on these rounds of
negotiation in Table 1.

The objective of the TPP negotiations remains to develop an FTA agreement
which will be able to adapt and incorporate current issues, concerns and interests of
members. Working groups have been established in the following areas: market
access, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, rules of origin,
customs cooperation, investment, services, financial services, telecommunications,
e-commerce, business mobility, government procurement, competition policy,
intellectual property, labor, environment, capacity building, trade remedies, and legal
and institutional issues. A unique departure from other FTAs is the group’s additional
focus on cross-cutting “horizontal issues” such as regional integration, regulatory
coherence, competitiveness, development and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
8

TPP member countries are home to more than 500 million people; one fifth of
APEC’s population. The nine participating economies account for 17.8 trillion USD,
or just over half of APEC’s GDP. The TPP economies account for 36% of total goods
trade and 47% of total service trade in APEC. These economies also accounted for 62%
of outward FDI and 58% of inward FDI in the APEC region (NZMFAT, 2012). This
regional FTA could have significant impacts on the global economy.

3. Model Specification
To assess the potential impacts of TPP both on China and other countries, we use
a general equilibrium model with both international trade in goods and trade costs.
Our global general equilibrium model has five countries and each country produce
two goods with two factors. These five countries are China, the US, Japan, other TPP
countries (OTPPC) and the rest of the world (ROW). The two goods are tradable
goods and non-tradable goods and are treated as heterogeneous across countries. The
two factors in each country are labor and capital, which are intersectorally mobile but
internationally immobile.
To this we add monetary structure using inside money following Whalley et al
(2011) and Li and Whalley (2012). This allows for the endogenous determination of
changes in trade imbalances for trade in goods following a TPP initiative, which are
offset through inter-temporal trade across countries in money; and also allows for a
calibration to a base case where China has a large trade surplus. This monetary
structure builds on Azariadis (1993) where there is extensive discussion of simple
overlapping generation models with inside money. Here, in addition, interactions
between monetary structure and commodity trade are needed, and hence motivates
models with simultaneous inter-temporal and inter-commodity structure.
In our general equilibrium model with monetary structure, we assume there are
two goods in each period and allow inter-commodity trade to co-exist within the
period along with trade in debt in the form of inside money. We use a single period
10

model where either claims on future consumption (money holding) or future
consumption liabilities (money insuance) enter the utility function as incremental
future consumption from current period savings. This is the formulation of inside
money used by Patinkin (1947, 1971) and Archibald and Lipsey (1960). This can also
be used in a multi-country model structure with trade in both goods and inside money.
On the production side of the model, we assume CES technology for production
of each good in each country (Figure 3)

On the consumption side, we use the Armington assumption of product
heterogeneity across countries, and assume claims on future consumption enter
preferences and are traded between countries. Each country can thus either issue or

11

buy claims on future consumption using current period income. We use a nested CES
utility function to capture consumption (Figure 3)

The composite of tradable goods is defined by another nesting level reflecting the
country from which goods come. We assume this level 2 composite consumption is of

Where xijT is the consumption of tradable goods from country j in country i . If
i  j this denotes that this country consumes its domestically produced tradable
goods.  ij is the share parameter for country j ' s tradable goods consumed in
country i .  i ' is the elasticity of substitution in level 2 preferences in country i .
We assume a representative consumer in country i with income as I i . The
12

budget constraint for this consumer’s consumption is

Pi T X iT  pciNT X iNT  pciY Yi  I i

(6)

Here, Yi represents both inside money (debt) held by country i , and also
country i ' s trade imbalance. Yi  0 implies a trade surplus (or positive claims on
future consumption); Yi  0 implies a trade deficit or future consumption liabilities
(effectively money issuance), and Yi  0 implies trade balance.
For trade deficit countries, utility will decrease in inside money since they are
issuers. In order to capture this given that Yi  0 for these countries, we use an upper
bound Y 0 in the utility function in a term [ Y 0  Yi ] following Whalley et al (2011)
and assume that Y 0 is large enough to ensure that Y 0  Yi  0 . We use the

transformation yi  Y 0  Yi to solve the optimization problem, and the utility

We introduce trade cost for trade between countries. Trade costs include not only
import tariffs but also other non-tariff barriers such as transportation costs, language
barriers, institutional barriers and etc. We divide trade costs into two parts in our
model; import tariff and non-tariff trade costs. We denote the import tariff in country
14

i as ti , and non-tariff trade costs as N ij (ad volume tariff-equivalent non-tariff

trade costs for country i imported from country j ). This yields the following
relation of consumption prices and production prices in country i for country j ' s
exports.

For non-tariff trade costs, they are different from the import tariff: they cannot collect
revenue, and importers need to use actual resources to cover the costs involved. In the
numerical model, we assume that the resource costs involved in overcoming all other
non-tariff barriers are denominated in terms of domestic non-tradable goods. We
incorporate this resource using feature through use of non-tradable goods equal in
value terms to the cost of the barrier. We thus assume reduced non-tariff trade costs
(including transportation cost) will thus occur under trade liberalization as an increase
in non-tradable goods consumption NRi by the representative consumer in importing
countries. The representative consumer’s income in country i is thus given by

The TPP FTA will thus reduce both import tariffs and non-tariff trade costs

equilibrium model above, we can calibrate it to a base case data set and then simulate
and explore TPP effects.

4. Trade Cost Calculations
We report our calculations of trade costs in this part which provide trade cost
estimates for use in our general equilibrium model. The methodology we use is from
Novy (2008) and Wong (2012). We calculate and report ad valorem tariff-equivalent
trade costs between countries for China, the US, Japan, other TPP countries (OTPPC),
and ROW from 2000 to 2010.
4.1 Trade Costs Definition

A broad definition of trade costs includes policy barriers (Tariffs and Non-tariff
barriers), transportation costs (freight and time costs) as well as communication and
other information costs, enforcement costs, foreign exchange costs, legal and
regulatory costs and local distribution costs. Figure 4 reports the structure of
representative trade costs used by Anderson and Wincoop (2004) to illustrate
conceptually what is involved.

Trade costs are reported in terms of their ad valorem tax equivalent. They are
large, even aside from trade policy barriers and even between apparently highly
integrated economies. The tax equivalent of representative trade costs for rich
countries is about 170% and this includes all transport, border-related and local
distribution costs from foreign producer to final user in the domestic country
(Anderson and Wincoop, 2004).
Trade costs also have large welfare implications. Current policy related costs are
often more than 10% of national income (Anderson and Wincoop, 2002). Obstfeld
and Rogoff (2000) commented that all the major puzzles of international
macroeconomics hinge on trade costs. Other studies estimate that for each 1%
reduction of trade transaction costs world income could increase by 30 to 40 billion
USD (APEC, 2002; OECD, 2003; De, 2006).
4.2 Methodology

Here, we have calculated trade costs for prospective TPP participants, China, and
other non-participants following the approaches in Head and Ries (2001), Novy (2008)
and Wong (2012). Their method is to take the ratio of bilateral trade flows over local
trade, scaled to some parameter values, and then use a measure that capture all
barriers. Some papers have argued that this measure is consistent with the gravity
equation and robust across a variety of trade models (Novy, 2008; Wong, 2012).
The gravity equation is one of the most robust empirical relationships in
economics which relates trade between two country to their economic size, bilateral
trade barriers, costs of production in exporter countries, and how remote the importer
18

is from the rest of the world (Wong, 2012). Some recent studies have provided the
micro foundations for the gravity equation, for example Anderson and Wincoop
(2003), Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Chaney (2008).
The measure of trade barriers used here is based on the gravity equation derived
from Chaney’s (2008) model of heterogeneous firms with bilateral fixed costs of
exporting. Trade barriers can take two forms in the model, a variable trade barrier  ir
and a fixed cost of exporting Fir . The variable trade barrier  ir is an iceberg cost. In
order to deliver one unit of good to i from r ,  ir  1 unit of good has to be
delivered. The gravity equation supported by this model is:

X ir 

Yi  Yr wr ir   ( 11)
(
) Fir
Y
i

(22)

Where X ir is import of country i from country r . Yi , Yr and Y are the
economic sizes of both countries and the total world, wr is labor costs,  ir is
variable trade costs and Fir is the fixed cost of exporting. The Pareto parameter 
governs the distribution of firm productivities.  is the elasticity of substitution in
preferences. i is a remoteness measure for the importing country which captures
trade diversion effects. The mechanism is that the further away i is from the rest of
the world, the more likely that r could export more to i due to less competition
from third party countries in the importer country. This has a similar interpretation to
the multilateral resistance term in Anderson and Wincoop (2003).
We can relate data on trade flows to unobservable trade barriers by taking ratios
of bilateral trade flows of two regions over local purchases of each of two countries:

19

X ir X ri
 
F F  (  1)
 ( ri ir )  ( ri ir )  1
X ii X rr
Fii Frr
 ii rr

(23)

This equation reveals the relationship between observable trade data and unobservable
trade barriers and eliminates the need to worry about the omission of unspecified or
unobserved trade barriers. If the fixed costs of exporting are not bilaterally
differentiated ( Fri  Fr ) or is they are constant across locations ( Fri  F ), the fixed
costs drop out of this measure and the measured trade costs would simply be
interpreted as variable trade costs, as in models without fixed export costs such as
Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Anderson and Wincoop (2003).
For simplicity of exposition, we normalize own trade costs to 1, i.e.  ii  1 and

Fii  1 . Defining the geometric average of trade costs between the country pair i and

r as

X X 
tir  ( ir ri ) 2

(25)

Data for this equation is relatively easy to obtain, and so we have a
comprehensive measure of trade barriers, and the ad valorem tariff-equivalent
bilateral average trade cost between country i and r can be written as
1

t ir  tir  1  (

(26)

Using the trade costs equation above, we can calculate actual trade costs between
20

countries in our general equilibrium model, which are needed in building a
benchmark data set for use in calibration and simulation.
4.3 Data and Results of Calculations

We need to calculate trade costs between each country pair for China, the US,
Japan, other TPP countries (OTPPC) and ROW. OTPPC denotes the summation of 8
TPP countries: Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and
Vietnam. For the ROW, we use world total minus China, the US, Japan and OTPPC to
yield the data we use in calculations.
For trade costs, in equation (26), X ir and X ri are separately exports and
imports between countries i and r . This trade data is from the UN comtrade
database, and total world trade data is from WTO International Trade Statistics 2011.
Due to market clearing, intranational trade X ii or X rr can be rewritten as total
income minus total exports (see equation (8) in Anderson and Wincoop(2003)),

X ii  yi  X i

(27)

Where X i is the total exports, defined as the sum of all exports from country i ,
which is

Xi 

X

r ,i  r

(28)

ir

This data is from the UN Comtrade database also. For yi , GDP data are not suitable
because they are based on value added, whereas the trade data are reported as gross
shipments. In addition, GDP data include services that are not covered by the trade
data (Novy, 2008). It is hard to get this income data according to such a definition, so
here we use GDP data minus total service value added. We get GDP data from World
21

Bank database, and the service share of GDP data from World Development
Indicators (WDI) of World Bank database, we then calculate results for GDP minus
services. We take the value of  to be 8.3 as in Eaton and Kortum (2002).

Results are shown in Table 2 and Figure 5. We only use trade cost data for 2010
22

in our numerical general equilibrium model, but to give more information on trade
costs over time, we have also calculated trade costs from 2000 to 2010.
From the results, we can see that nearly all trade costs between countries have
decreased as time passes; except in 2009, because of the financial crisis. All countries’
trade costs increased in that year and then decreased again in 2010. For pairs of
country trade costs, China-US trade costs are higher than China-Japan trade costs; and
they are separately 33.38% and 28.45% (ad valorem tariff equivalent) in 2010.
Japan-US trade costs are higher than China-US trade costs; they are separately 37.43%
and 33.38% in 2010.

5. Data and Parameters Calibration
We use 2010 as our base year in building a benchmark general equilibrium
dataset for use in calibration and simulation following the method set out in Shoven
and Whalley (1992). There are five countries in our model, and the OTPPC data is
obtained by adding Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore
and Vietnam together, and ROW data is obtained from total world values minus
values for China, US, Japan and OTPPC. For the two goods, we assume secondary
industry (manufacturing) reflects tradable goods, and primary and tertiary industries
(agriculture, extractive industries, and services) yield non-tradable goods. For the two
factor inputs, capital and labor, we use total labor income (wage) to denote labor
values for inputs by sector. All data are in billion US dollars. We adjust some of the
data values for mutual consistency for calibration purposes.
Chinese data are from China data online. We use production and capital values to
determine labor values by residual for China. US data are from the Statistics Database
of Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), capital and labor data are from the
input-output table. Japan, OTPPC and ROW data are all from World Bank database
(World Development Indicate). We use agriculture and service share of GDP data and
GDP data to yield production data of tradable goods and non-tradable goods, and use
capital/GDP ratio to yield capital and labor input in production. We set the upper
bound in our monetary structure, Y 0 , to equal 1000 in all countries; and change this
value in later sensitivity analysis to check its influence on simulation results. These
24

data are listed in Table 3.

Trade data between each pair of countries are from the UN Comtrade database.
We use individual country total export and import values to indirectly yield exports to
and imports from the ROW. Using production and trade data, we can then calculate
each country’s consumption values. All trade data are listed in Table 4.

We divide trade costs into two parts, import tariffs and all other non-tariff
barriers. We obtain each country’s import tariff data from WTO Statistics Database.
25

For ROW, we cannot obtain its import tariff directly, and so we use European Union’s
tariff rate to denote these values. We calculate all other non-tariff barriers by using
trade costs (in Table 2) minus import tariffs. All import tariffs and other non-tariff
barrier values are listed in Tables 5 and 6.

There are no available estimates of elasticities for individual countries on the
demand and production sides of the model. Many of the estimates of domestic and
import goods substitution elasticity are around 2 (Betina et al, 2006), so we set all
these elasticities in our model to 2 (Whalley and Wang, 2010). We change these
elasticities later in sensitivity analysis to check their influence on simulation results.
With these data, we calibrate the model parameters and report parameter values
in Table 7. When used in model solution these will regenerate the benchmark data as
an equilibrium for the model. Then, using these parameters we can simulate the
effects of TPP changes under different scenarios.

27

6. Simulation Results
We report counterfactual simulation results in this part to assess the potential
effects of TPP on China and other countries under different scenarios. In our model,
we divide trade costs into two parts, import tariffs and other all non-tariff barriers.
According to the TPP negotiation targets, the aim is to set up a free trade area, and for
import tariffs to be completely eliminated among participants after the negotiation of
the TPP. In the meanwhile, TPP negotiations will focus on institutional areas,
technical and standard barriers, investment, services and other impediments, which
implies other all non-tariff barriers will be reduced and, in the long run, even
completely removed. In our simulation analysis, we first assume that the TPP will
completely eliminate tariff barriers (free trade), and then either partially (with weights
denoting the percentage by which non-tariff barriers will be reduced) or completely
eliminate other all non-tariff barriers. We focus on effects on production, welfare
(utility), export, import and revenue and trade imbalances, and use percentage
changes compared to 2010 data to show these effects.
6.1 Potential Effects of TPP on China and Other Countries

We initially use two different scenarios to capture TPP effects, the first assumes
TPP eliminates all trade costs (including tariff and other all non-tariff barriers)
between members; the second assumes TPP only eliminates tariffs between member
countries. Table 8 and Figure 6 show these results.
For China, production, welfare, import and revenue all will be negatively affected,
28

but exports and the trade imbalance increase. Under whole trade costs elimination,
these effects are stronger than only under import tariff elimination. When all trade
costs are removed, China’s welfare will decrease -0.056%, production will decrease
-0.042%, imports will decrease -0.171% and revenues will decrease about -0.172%;
meanwhile, exports and the trade imbalance will separately increase 0.132% and
2.439%. But when only import tariffs are removed, China’s welfare, production,
import and revenue separately decline by -0.011%, -0.009%, -0.035% and -0.035%;
and exports and the trade imbalance improve separately by 0.04% and 0.609%. This
suggests that TPP initiatives could have negative effects on China but the impacts are
not severe.

TPP member countries, US and other TPP countries (OTPPC), both gain from the
FTA agreement. Their production, welfare, export and import all increase and only
revenues decrease. Comparatively, OTPPC will gain more than the US. For Japan, its
29

total production will increase (gain) but welfare will decrease (lose); revenue, export
and import all will decrease (lose) but their trade surplus will increase also. ROW will
lose comprehensively, its total production, welfare, export, import and revenue all
decrease and only their trade surplus will increase. Total world production, welfare
and trade all increase.

In general, present TPP initiatives are beneficial for member countries, but will
hurt other countries outside of the organization like China, Japan and ROW. Although
this kind of regional FTA is good for regional trade liberalization but may form
another kind of protectionism to outside countries. Additionally, the effects of current
cooperation among TPP countries are small because trade between these member
countries is not very big. In the meanwhile, present TPP negotiations have not yet
30

reached agreement and they may need a long time to negotiate and may even not
reach agreement. Therefore, the TPP initiative for now does not provide a major
economic challenge to China and other non-TPP countries.
6.2 Effects of TPP under Giving Weights to Non-tariff Barriers Elimination

Other non-tariff barriers include transportation costs and some other costs that
cannot be reduced by a TPP negotiation, such as added transportation costs, so it may
not be realistic to assume that a TPP can remove all other non-tariff barriers. We
therefore give weights to other non-tariff barriers elimination by assuming that TPP
just removes part of non-tariff barriers. We use weights 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% to
explore four different cases, which means that TPP can remove separately 20%, 40%,
60% and 80% of other all non-tariff trade barriers. We report these results in Table 9
and Figure 7.

TPP impacts are similar to those in Table 8, but the intensity of the effects
becomes stronger as weights increase. We can take China’s welfare variations as an
example. This will change separately by -0.019%, -0.027%, -0.035% and -0.045%
when weights equals 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%. In summary, TPP effects shown in
this part are as follows: China, Japan and ROW will have a reduction in total
production, welfare and trade. The US and OTPPC will gain from this FTA agreement.
Total world production and welfare will increase. All countries’ revenue will decrease.
TPP effects are relatively robust even if we assume that TPP can just partially
remove other non-tariff barriers. For the TPP influence on China which we focus on
in this paper, it is clear that it will hurt China, but the effects are not severe.
Meanwhile, it is China’s exports will increase and imports will decrease which means
that the trade surplus will increase. This result comes in part from the import increase
by ROW from China.
6.3 Sensitivity Analysis of TPP Effects

We perform sensitivity analysis by changing the values of elasticities and upper
bound money to check the robustness of TPP effects. We change elasticities in both
production and consumption to separately equal 0.6, 1.6 and 2.6, and change the
upper bound Y 0 to 2000, 3000, and 4000. We then recalibrate parameters and
simulate TPP effects. For simplicity, we only check the sensitivities of TPP effects for
the whole trade costs elimination case, which is the main result for this paper. These
results are reported in Table 10 and Figure 8.

Comparing sensitivity results with the basic results in Table 8, we find that all
impacts (positive or negative) are of the same sign except for production, import and
revenue changes for China, welfare changes for Japan, and welfare, export and import
changes for ROW under elasticities equal to 0.6. These results suggest that TPP
impact results on China and other countries are reasonably reliable and robustness.
We take the effects on China as an example to compare different influences under
different elasticities and upper bound money values (Figure 8). We find that China’s
production will decrease except when elasticities equal 0.6, welfare will decrease and
change between -0.018 and -0.091 except when elasticities equal 0.6, export will
increase expect when elasticities are small (0.6), imports will decrease except when
elasticities equal 0.6, and revenues will decrease except when elasticities equal 0.6.
All sensitivity analyze results show TPP effects are beneficial for member
35

countries but adverse for countries out of TPP. Total world production and welfare
improved.
6.4 Effects When Japan Joins in TPP

Japan has already decided to negotiate to join in TPP. As one of big developed
countries, its joining TPP will influence the global economy significantly. We thus
further explore the effects if Japan joins in. We do this by scenario simulation and
report these results in Table 11 and Figure 9. We divide this scenario into three cases:
whole trade costs elimination, 50% non-tariff barrier elimination and only tariff
elimination.
Simulation results show that China will be adversely affected by TPP, and this
loss is larger than the case if Japan does not participate in the TPP. Specifically
China’s production and welfare decrease are about -0.056% and 0.084% in the whole
trade costs elimination case. These effects will weaken if TPP is partially eliminated
non-tariff barriers or only import tariff barriers are eliminated. A difference from the
results when Japan does not join in TPP, is that China’s exports, imports and trade
imbalance all will be reduced after Japan’s participation. Revenue for China will
decrease also.
For TPP member countries, the US, Japan and OTPPC all gain from the FTA, but
comparatively the US and OTPPC gain more when Japan does not take part.
Specifically, the US, Japan and OTPPC will separately increase production by 1.981%,
7.166% and 6.043%; and will separately increase welfare by 0.51%, 1.057% and
2.461% in a whole trade costs elimination case. But these member countries’ revenues
36

all decrease. As a country out of TPP, the ROW will suffer in terms of welfare,
production, export, import, trade imbalance and revenue impacts. Total world
production and welfare will increase from Japan’s participation in TPP. Additionally
TPP effects under whole trade costs elimination are the strongest, whole effects under
partial non-tariff barrier elimination are the second strongest. Effects under tariff
elimination only are the least.

In summary, China and ROW will suffered for an alleviation of TPP. On the
contrary, TPP member countries, including the US, Japan and OTPPC all gain.
Comparatively in proportional terms OTPPC gains the most, Japan gains second, and
37

the US gains the least. Therefore, Japan’s joining TPP will negatively affect China,
but good for both Japan and present TPP member countries.

6.5 Comparing the Effects of TPP Free Trade and Global Free Trade

We compare the effects of TPP free trade and global free trade in this part and
report simulation results in Table 12 which shows changes under global free trade
relative to the benchmark situation. Figure 10 compares effects of TPP free trade and
global free trade.
It is clear that global free trade will benefit both China and all other countries.
For China, its welfare will increase by 2.57%, production by 10.89%, export by
37.4%, imports by 33.9% and trade balance increase by 63.7% for the whole trade
costs elimination case. But under only tariff elimination, China’s imbalance will
decrease by about -31.3%.
38

All other countries will benefit from global free trade. For the whole trade costs
elimination case, the welfare of the US, Japan, OTPPC, ROW and the world will
increase separately by about 1.6%, 3.2%, 6.3%, 0.7% and 1.6%. These gains are much
higher than for a TPP regional free trade agreement.

There are some differences between the TPP effects and global free trade effects.
Firstly, global free trade will increase all country’s trade, production and welfare, but
TPP just benefits member countries but hurts other countries outside of the TPP.
Secondly, global free trade effects are much stronger and more significant than TPP
effects. We also find that small countries will gain more from free trade and big
countries will gain less, whether this trade freedom is global or regional.
6.6 The Effects of China’s Becoming A TPP Member

China is a big country in APEC and one of main trade partner countries with
present TPP member countries. So it is helpful to explore the potential effects of
China’s joining TPP. We report results for this scenario simulation in Table 13 and
Figure 11. We evaluate this scenario in three separate subcases: whole trade cost
elimination, 50% non-tariff barriers elimination, and only import tariff elimination.

From these results, it seems clear that China will benefit from TPP participation
(see Figure 11). On production side, China will increase output separately by 3.816%,
1.967% and 0.59% under the three different trade costs elimination cases. On the
welfare side, China will gain about 1.125% under whole trade costs elimination
situation. Trade for China also will increase significantly under TPP participation.
Other TPP member countries, the US and OTPPC will all gain in terms of total
production, welfare, export and import. Countries outside of TPP (ROW) will lose in

41

production, welfare, export and import. Total world production, welfare and trade will
all rise which suggests that regional trade liberalization will in aggregate benefit
global trade and welfare. Japan is a different case in that although not a member of
TPP, still gains in production, welfare and trade. Comparing specific impacts on TPP
member countries, OTPPC will gain the most, China the second, the US the third and
Japan the least. TPP effects will increase as trade costs decrease more.
These results thus suggest that China will gain if China joins TPP and China’s
engagement will further improve other TPP member countries’ production and
welfare.

7. Conclusions and Remarks
We explore the potential effects of a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiation
on participant and non-participant countries, stressing the effects on China. We use a
general equilibrium model with monetary structure incorporating inside money to
yield an endogenously determined trade surplus, and also numerically calibrate to
2010 data in a five country single period global general equilibrium model covering
China, US, Japan, Other TPP countries (OTPPC) and the rest of world (ROW) in
which large trade imbalances occur. We calculate trade costs using a revised gravity
model method following Novy (2008) and Wong (2012). We incorporate trade costs in
the numerical general equilibrium model and explore potential TPP effects on China
and other countries. We capture possible TPP effects by considering six cases. These
are: (1) TPP effects under complete removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers against
each other; (2) TPP effects under partial other non-tariff barriers removal; (3)
sensitivity analysis with changing elasticities and an upper bound parameter in the
monetary structure; (4) TPP effects if Japan joins; (5) Comparison of TPP and global
free trade effects; (6) TPP effects if China joins.
Our simulation results reveal that present TPP arrangements will hurt China and
other non-TPP member countries, including Japan and the rest of world, but benefit
TPP member countries. Total world production and welfare will improve because of
these regional trade liberalization effects. These effects will be more significant as
trade liberalization deepening occurs. If Japan joins TPP, China will suffer further
43

compared with a TPP without Japan. But Japan and other TPP countries will gain.
When China joins TPP initiative, all countries will benefit except ROW, and China’s
total production will increase by about 3.8%, welfare will increase about 1.1% and
trade increase more than 10% under complete trade costs removal. Effects from a
comparison of TPP and global free trade suggest that global free trade is beneficial to
all countries, not like TPP (regional free trade) which just benefits member countries
but hurt others. Global free trade effects are much stronger than TPP effects.
TPP will hurt non-member countries’ including China, but these negative effects
are not strong, so that China may not need to worry too much about TPP’s influence.
Japan can gain from TPP participation; but this will hurt China further. China will
gain if she joins TPP, and it will benefit other countries in TPP for China is an
important trade partner for them. Therefore TPP may become more important and
have more influence if China can become a member. As a regional free trade
arrangement, TPP will benefit member countries and contribute to global total
production and welfare but will hurt non-member countries. TPP, in some form may
function as a kind of regional trade protectionism instrument, and so ultimately it is
global free trade that will benefit all countries.
