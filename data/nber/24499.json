    "abstract": "\n\nWe provide the first evidence on the effects of expansions to private and public insurance programs on children\u2019s use of specialty substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. We combine administrative government data over the period 1996 to 2017 with quasi-experimental differences-in-differences methods to study this question. Expansions of the private market \u2013 laws that compel insurers to cover SUD treatment services as parity with general healthcare \u2013 increase admissions by 21%. Increases in admissions are driven by patients with private coverage and receiving outpatient care. The number of admissions of patients with no insurance also increases following parity law adoption. There is mixed evidence on changes in admissions following a public insurance expansion that increases the income eligibility thresholds for Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\n",
