Oettinger, and Robert A. Leone for guiding this research and
reviewing earlier drafts of this paper. Errors are, of course,
mine alone.

Usually transportation/communication (tic) considerations appear as only
two in a long list of factors which determine headquarters location patterns.
The research reported here singles out tic considerations as the logical

basis for headquarters location decisions. The primary probe -is: to what
degree

do transportation/communication consideration explain the patterns of

headquarters location? The case of manufacturing firms with five or more
establishments and no manufacturing activity at the headquarters location was
examined. The tic considerations were studied in terms ofd the advantages of
close

proximity between the headquarters of

a firm

and

the manufacturing

establishments of that firm and the advantages of close proximity between the

headquarters of one firm and the headquarters of other firms. The findings

of this research show that the logic of headquarters location patterns is
heavily dependent on t/c considerations.
An

understanding of the implication of tic considerations for headquarters

logistics is a prerequisite for assessing the

potential impact of changes in

and transportation technologies on headquarters location patterns
and for developing policy in this area. Since industrial logistics play such
information

large

role in

public

determining the shape of cities1,

a

this probe also has wider

policy interest.

Introduction

There are essentiafly two approaches to the analysis of the location of

manufacturing firms in the logistics literature. First, progress has been made
in actually describing patterns of manufacturing location, especially for urban

areas.

For example, Hoover and Vernon2 identify three locational zones —— core,

inner ring, and

outer

ring ——

for

the New York Metropolitan Region. They go on

to classify certain special industry clusters, such as communication—oriented

industries,aid begin t investigate factors in the dynamics of location decisions ——

agglomeration, the incubator hypothesis, and the search for space. An important
spur to the quantification of these portrayals has been the development and
exploitation of massive data banks.

Descriptive

and exploratory studies which

make heavy use of data have added new dimensions to the discussion of manufacturing

location. Leone's time series analysis of marginal establishments3 and the
Regional Plan Association's project on the office industry in New York are
examples of this new breed of descriptive logistics study.
U

The second direction of research takes a comparative cost approach to
determining where industrial establishments should locate on the basis of

varying factor prices. These studies create prescriptive models based on
microeconomic theory and decision analysis and compare the predictions of those

mo.els with actual locational patterns. Isard follows the comparative cost
approach on the national level by looking at regional cost differentials for
the petrochemical, iron and steel, and aluniinim industries. 5

Similarly, Kemper

uses regression analysis to relate the locations of industry births to sixteen
industry characteristics in five zones of the New York Metropolitan region.6

Daly and Webber review much of the prescriptive models literature dealing with
industrial distributions in cities7.

Both of these approaches to logistics stress the importance of t/c considera-

tions. Some examples from each approach will be presented. On the descriptive
side, Leone conjectures that8:

communication advances appear to be weakening the spatial ties
between establishments in multiëstablishment firms, thereby
facilitating the process of land use specialization.
He goes on to write9:

An important technological factor has been the improvement in
communications made possible by expanded low—cost intercity
telephone service and electronic data processing and transmission.
Within urban areas, this has been a force for decentralization.

In contrast with Leone?s fin.ings, the report

of the

Regional Plan Association

points out the enduring importance of personal communication which encourages a
high concentration of offices10:

There is a clear preference of headquarters for the Manhattan
Central Business District, where 80 percent of the Region's —
and nearly 20 percent of the nation's —— headquarters jobs are
located... The determining locational factor here certainly
would seem to be the facilitation of face—to—face communication
by executive decision—makers in an "environment" of high intention.
Transportation/communication considerations have also been handled by the

prescriptive modelers of manufacturing logistics. The folThwing passage from

•

Daly and Webber shows how changes in transportation and communication technologies
•

have affected the comparative cost approach to logistics11:

Up to the third decade of the twentieth century the Weberian
least—cost location models could be applied to the intra—city
case; there were considerable savings in transport costs for firms
which located close to the city center and the major rail terminals...
The situation has changed drastically over the past 30 years:
factories have dispersed over broad areas of the city; the types of
manufacturing have diversified; technological change has been
rapid; the marketsof metropolitan-based firms have multiplied
throughout states and nations; and the manufacturing labor force
has spread from the central city to the suburbs. All of this
has weakened the importance of transport. costs in the firm' s
decision on where to locate within the city.

As a result of these changes, the locational effects of least—cost modeling
had to be re—examined and the role of t/c demands in those models had to be

reassessed. It should be noted here that this paper will look at how t/c
considerations affect the decision of where headquarters locate within the

United States and not within a city. Entire cities will be used as units of
analysis, with no concern for location within cities.
This study will examine the t/c considerations in light of the basic

structure of the firm. A multi—establishment firm is made up of branch and
headquarters establishments, and each establishment does or does not carry on
manufacturing activities. Most previous studies ignore the str'icture of firms

and deal solely with establishments. The spatial configuration of establishments
of

a firm

is

thereby neglected. However, in the study of the tic considerations

in the location of the headquarters of a firm, the location of the manufacturing
branches of the firm are clearly important.
The

section

remainder of this paper is organized in four sections. The first
develops the location theory with regard to headquarters of multi-

establishment manufacturing firms. The specific hypotheses which will undergo
empirical testing are derived and. explained

in this section. The next section

explains the data base used in this study. This description should make the
reader aware of the possibilities and problems of the ensuing empirical analysis
using this data base. Third, the empirical aialysis is reviewed. Three
topics are covered: (A) Procedural decisions which serve as a bridge from the
ab'stract location theory to the use of data to test the hypotheses; (B) Empirical
evidence regarding the hypotheses and various

I Derivation of Five Specific Headquarters Location Hypotheses
The macro—hypothesis of this research is that there exists an underlying
logic in the logistics of the multi—establishment firm and that the role of t/c

considerations in that logic can be assessed. This research will emphasize
the logic of the location of headquarters of multi—establishment firms.
The following diagram presents an overview of the hypotheses examined by
this research:

Macro—Hypothesis:

to the logic of headquarters

Weak Intrafirm hypothesis:
Headquarters will locate with
regard to the spatial configuration of their, manufacturing
establishments.

regard to the location of other
headquarters of manufacturing
firms.

Headquarters will locate "near" at
least one manufacturing establishment of the firm.

cities with the headquarters of
many other manufacturing firms.

in the "center" of the

establishments.

Strong Intrafirm hypothesis:
Headquarters will locate "near"
the "largest" manufacturing
establishment of the firm.

Strong Interfirm Hypothesis:

Headquarters will locate in the
major

city with the most other
headquarters of manufacturing
firms.

The choice of location for the headquarters of the firm must take into
account both intrafirm and

interfirm

motives. These motives have been explained

in a number of qualitative analyses of headquarters logistics. Leone in
Location of Manufacturing Activity in the New York Metropolitan Area points out
the tension between intrafirm and interfirm motives12:

Whereas the advantages of a New York City location for the
control function in a business have always been great, given the
proximity to the financial community, access to the educational
and legal establishment, and so on, in the past these advantages
have frequently been counterbalanced by the diseconomies of
separating control functions from operating functions.

To make

the

association between Leone's terms "control functidns" and. "operating

and

functions"

the

distinction between headquarters and manufacturing establish-

ment activities, assume that the headquarters is concerned with control functions
and the manufacturing establishments are concerned with operating functions.
This

point

will be returned

to later in

the decision to look only at non—

manufacturing headquarters, that is firms which have no manufacturing activity

at their headquarters
The

locations. The Regional Plan Association study called

Office Industry: Patterns of Growtth and Location points to the
Manufacturing tends to be directed from a detached front

same two motives'3:

office and has both strong inward (production) and strong
outward (market) linkages.

Both

the

motives depend on tic considerations as

factors in the logistics of

headquarters. Before characterizing these motives more explicitly, it will

be helpful to introduce one piece of logistic jargon here. The tendency for the
headquarters of many

firms

to group together in major cities, with the headquarters

of any given firm locating in a major city primarily because the headquarters
of many

other

firms are located there, is called the agglomeration effect. The

agglomeration effect has an important role in the interfirm motive.

An explicit definition of the two motives, with the appropriate interpretation of the tic considerations, can now be stated:
Intrafirrn Motive: the purpose of the headquarters is to tie together and
coordinate

would

be

the manufacturing establishments of the

firm. In this case, one

interested in the location of the headquarters with respect to the

manufacturing establishments of the firm. The exchanges and information flows

are between the headquarters and the. manufacturing establishments of the firm.
The cost and effectiveness of these exchanges and information flows can be
influenced by the location of the headquarters.

Interfirm Motive: the purpose of the headquarters is to solicit business
for the firm, secure necessary inputs for the firm, and. provide connections with

other firms. Here one would be interested in the location of the headquarters
with respect to major cities where there will be an agglomeration of headquarters.
The exchanges and

•

•

information

flows are between the headquarters of the given

firm and the headquarters of other

firms. The cost and

effectiveness of these

exchanges and information flows can be influenced bj the location of the
headquarters of the given firm.

The statements of two hypotheses follow directly from the definition of

the intrafirm and interfirm motives. These hypotheses will be referred to as
the weak hypotheses derived from the two motives.

Weak Intrafirm Hypothesis: headquarters will located with regard to the
spatial configuration of their manufacturing establishments. The patterns of
headquarters locations will show that the location of the headquarters of a firm

is chosen to be either in close proximity to at least one of the manufacturing
establishments of the firm or toward the center of the spatial configuration of
the manufacturing establishments.
Weak

Interfirm Hypothesis:

ladquarters will locate

with regard to the

location of headquarters of other manufacturing firms. The patterns of headquarters
locations will show
be

that the location of the headquarters of a firm

is chosen to

in close proximity to many other manufacturing headquarters and hence in

one of the major commercial cities of the country.

Each of these weak

hypotheses can

be strengthened in specificity. If the

intrafirm motive is a valid primary interpretation ofthe logic underlying the
location of the headquarters for multi—establishment firms, then the headquarters
should

be located either "near" at least one of the manufacturing establishments

of the firm or toward the "center" of the spatial configuration of the manufacturing
establishments. (The research approach to the concepts of distance and
centrality, given the limitations of the available data base, will
•

be discussed

in section Ill—a.) If the headquarters must be "near" at least one of the
manufacturing establishments, is there any particular estalishment it should be
"near" more often than any other? If one establishment must be chosen, the most

•

obvious justification on the conceptual level exists for assuming that it must

be the "largest" manufacturing establishment. (The handling of size will be

discussed in section Ill—a.) Two lines of reasoning are presented for the
derivation of this strong intrafirm hypothesis:

Infrafirm Consideration Justification: this pattern may yield closer
contact between administration personnel and the

most important and/or greatest

number of operation personnel with lower exchange and information flow cost and
higher effectiveness. The cost and effectiveness are related to the trans—

porttion and communication of: (1) services provided by the headquarters for
the

manufacturing establishments; and

(2) Information

demands made of the

manufacturing establishment by the headquarters. Other characteristics of the
manufacturing

establishments being equal, both of these regards should increase

with the size of the

increase

manufacturing establishment. Furthermore, the cost should

and the effectiveness decrease with the distance from the manufacturing

establishment to the headquarters.

Interfirm Considerations Justification: the need to interface with other

in

firms

the

the supply of inputs and the marketing of outputs will be greater for

largest manufacturing

establishment. These are the types of services

provided by the headquarters. Also, the firm's demands for interfaces with
other firms will more likely center about the largest manufacturing establisbmen—
than any of the smaller manufacturing establishments.
Note that in this case the interfjrni considerations justification operates

on a secondary level and has nothing to do with the agglomeration of headquarters.
Instead, the interfirm considerations here recognize the need of the operating
functions

of

a manufacturing establishment to interface with

this interface

stronger forms of the intrafirm motive, such as that the firm will

locate its headquarters "near" the highest concentration of its manufacturing
establishments,

are

possible

but will

not

be explored in this paper.

Next, examine the stroner form of the interfirm motive. Following the

agglomeration effect leads to this hypothesis: the major city with the most
headquarters

other

of manufacturing firms will have

many more headquarters than

any

major city. From the logic of the agglomeration effect, the process

resulting in this situation is as follows: let A and B be two major cities
with the number of

number

headquarters of manufacturing firms

in A greater than the

in B. Firm X has to decide where to locate its headquarters. If X

emphasizes the interfirm motive, it

will

choose to locate its headquarters in

some major city to be close to the headquarters of firms with which it interacts15
Assume that X has only A and B from which to choose for the location of its

headquarters in a major city. Then, all other

factors such as the distribution of

headquarters by industry and size being equal for A and B, X will choose to
locate in A because, under the interfirm motive, X wants its headquarters to be

near as many other headquarters as possible. Hence, the number of headquarters
in A has increased both absolutely and relative to B. Finally, there will be a
tipping phenomenon,and several headquarters in B may choose to move to A for
the same reasons of the interfirin motive, while any reverse flow would be unlikely.

Of course in the real world major cities do offer certain regional
advantages, and they do differ in the distribution of.-headquarters by industry.

These aspects also influence the super—agglomeration forces, that is the forces

which lead to an extremely heavy concentration of headquarters in one city. This
form of the strong interfirm motive can also be analyzed from the perspective
of models of micromotives and macrophenomenal6 and gravity and potential models17.
The

statements of the strong hypotheses derived from the intrafirm and

interfirm

motives will be suinniarized as follows:

to keep three shortcomings of the DM1 file in mind when reviewing the research

design and conclusions of this study. The three problem areas are: (i) file
accuracy; (2) the concept of distance; and (3) the nature of the multi—establishment
firm.

(1) File Accuracy: Spot checks of corporate annual reports and Moody's

Manual show that the DM1 file misses some establishments but has no

establishments

not reported in the other sources. Part of

the problem

may be

in the hazy definition of what constitutes a manufacturing establishment.

Different sources use different criteria. For example, an establishment that
is primarily a warehouse may be called a plant by Moody's but not qualify as a

manufacturing establishment for DM1. It is hard to say which is the more
reliable source and how exactly a plant differs from a manufacturing establishment.

(2) Concept of Distance: although the DM1 file codes the location of each

five different spatial units, no ready means of calculating
the distance between establishments is built into the file. Beneath the technical
establishment by

problems of adding to the file geographical distances or coordinates lies a level
of conceptual difficulties. Does it make sense to use geographic distance to
measure how "near" one establishment is to another? Why not use air

problem, and it is probably true that no simple addition to the DM1 file

could completely satisfy the requirement for a useful measure of distance.
This problem will limit the evaluation of the intrafirm motive, as will be seen
in section 111—A.

(3) Nature of the Multi—establishment Firm: the SIC

codes of

the establish-

ments in a multi-establishment firm give some indication of whether a firm is

vertically or horizontally integrated. However, there is no information about
the inter—relationship of the manufacturing establishments in a firn, the

interaction

between the headquarters and each establishment of the firm, or the

linkage between the headquarters of one firm and the headquarters of other firms.

Certainly, the degree of linkage between the headquarters and a manufacturing
establishment of the firm varies across manufacturing
solely

establishments

and is not

dependent on the size of the manufacturing establishment. However, no

information on these relationships exists in the DM1 file. Once again, this is

as much a conceptual problem as a data problem. Difficulties arising from this
limitation are noted in sections 111—A and 111—C.

Which manufacturing establishments to include in the analysis:

a multi—establishment firm is defined as any firm with two or more establishments.
This study only looks at a subset of multi—establishment firms, those with five

or more establishments and d.th non-manufacturing headquarters. The decision to
look at those firms with non—manufacturing headquarters was made in order to

strengthen the association between headquarters location and solely the location

of t1e control functions of the firm. One can conjecture without too much
abstraction from reality that the firms with non—manufacturing, or separate,
headquarters

the

locations respond purely

t/c considerations

to the intrafirm and interfirm motives and

therein. On the

other hand, the analysis of those firms

which do some manufacturing at their headquarters location must include

inter-

Although

some of these location factors overlap with the TTp.Ljre?t headquarters

location factors,

they are far from the logic of the intrafirm and interfirm

motives. To rephrase this point, the goal of this research project is to find
out to what degree simple t/c considerations can explain headquarters location.

It is understood that these considerations are not tie only location factors for

any headquarters, non—manufacturin or manufacturing. Nevertheless, it will be

much

simpler to

assess the importance of t/,c considerations in headquarters

location decisions in the case of non—manufacturing headquarters where these
considerations should have a much greater weight than in the case of manufacturing

headquarters. If they are minimal under these "pure" restrictions, they are
even less likely to be important in the "mixed" case. Finding a significant
effect in the pure case leaves open the option to assess the mixed case.

Unless the sample size were intolerably reduced by the assumption of
separate headquarters, it would be unwise to pollute the t/c considerations at

this time. As a result

of this decision, 1568 manufacturing multi—establishment

firms with separate headquarters locations were selected.

The other component of the restriction is the limitation to firms of five

or more establishments. The underlying proposition is that multi—establishment
firms with large numbers of establishments are fundamentally different from

those of a small number of establishments. Firwith a large number of
establishments are, in general, less localized, have a more dispersed spatial
configuration of establishments, and have a higher magnitude of intrafirm and

interfirm demands on the headquarters. The role of t/c considerations seems
likely to assume a greater weight in the location factors for the headquarters
of

a large multi—establishment firm.

line

The decision to use five as the dividing

between small and large multi—establishment firms

was somewhat

arbitrary

and intuitive. Once again, unless the sample size would become

small,

it

would be advantageous to limit

the

intolerably
sample in this analysis to those

firms having a heavier dependence on t/c considerations in the choice of

headquarters location. This decision reduced the total sample of 1,568
multi—establishment
file

manufacturing firms

to a aample of 263 firms

with

with

separate headquarters in the DM1

five or more establishments for the rear

1971.

(2) Handling of subsidiaries: the data of the DM1 file allow the researcher

to

distinguish establishments of a non—affiliated firm, a subsidiary

parent

firm,

and

a

firm. The analysis which follows combines these three types of firms.

If a firm of any one of these three types has five or more establishments and

a separate headquarters location, it was included in this analysis. The findings
show that it may have been wiser to limit the analysis to non—affiliated firms

or to find an alternative way of regarding the location of the headquarters of

a subsidiary or parent firm. This aspect of the findings will be pointed out
later in section 111—C.

(3) Use of spatial units instead of distances: as was ex.p1.ned in
section II, the concept of distance between establishments is very tricky on
the theoretical level, and no measures of distance or locational coordinates are

included in the DM1 file. Yet, it was noted in the section on locational theory
that some approach to the closeness of two establishments is vital for testing

the hypotheses, especially those dealing with the intrafirm motive. As a
surrogate for distance, this analysis will ask whether or not two establishments

are in the same spatial unit. Recall that the DM1 file codes each establishment

by five spatial units —— state, SMSA, county, city, and zip code. Analysis

of whether the headquarters of a firm is "near" any manufacturing establishment

of that firm was conducted on two levels: (1) Is any manufacturing establishment
in the same state as the headquarters? and (2) Is any manufacturing establishment

in

the same city as the headquarters? Obviously, disproportionate weight is

given to the boundary lines between states and cities by this method. This

satisfactory for an exact analysis of the logistics
of headquarters, but it will suffice for the present initial analysis of the

proôedure is far from totally

S

intrafirm and interfirm motives.

In order to compensate for the spillover of certain metropolitan areas
beyond city and state boundaries, two special units were defined. If two
establishments are in the same special unit, then they are counted as being
the same state and in the

New

in

same city. The first special unit encompasses the

York Metropolitan Area. The twenty—two counties in New York, New Jersey,

and Connecticut named by Hoover and Vernon in Anatomy of a Metropolis21 were

combined to comprise this special unit. The
Chicago

second special unit

covers

the

Metropolitan Area. This area extends over eight countries, six in

Illinois

and

two in Indiana. Additional special units, to cover such interstate

metropolitan areas as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania —

New

Jersey and Kansas

City,

Missouri — Kansas, may be useful in future research.
One consequence of the replacement of measures of distance by

units

spatial

is that it is not possible to analyze centrality. Analysis of whether

headquarters follow the form of the weak intrafirm hypothesis stating "locate
in the 'center' of the spatial configuration of manufacturing establishments"

is beyond the scope of this study. Hence, it will only be possible to identify
those firms with headquarters in the same spatial unit as a manufacturing establish-

ment as firms follodng the t/c considerations of the weak intrafirm hypothesis.
This approach may affect the evaluation of that hypothesis.

(it) Measurement of the size of establishments: section II mentioned that
the DM1

file

annual sales volume, number

has three types of size indicators ——

of employees, and net worth. However, annual sales volume and net worth data
only apply on the firm level. For multi—establishment firms, the only size
indicator on each establishment is the number of employees. Still, this

indicator is quite saitsfactory for present purposes. Given this indicator

makes certain predictions about the locational

patterns of headquarters. However, finding that the behavior of a firm
corresponds to the prediction of one of the hypotheses does not necessarily mean
that the firm is consciously locating with regard to the t/c considerations of

the hypothesis. In other words, there is a certain element of randomness of
behavior which may be mistaken for sensitlyity to t/c considerations. The
headquarters

of a firm may just happen to be in the same state as a manufacturing

establishment of the firm with no regard for the intrafirm motive. Likewise,
the headquarters of a firm may just happen to be in a major city wi•th no
regard for the interfirin motive. Use the phrE.se behaving inacord. with the
predictions of an hypothesis to refer to any firm whose behavior corresponds
to the predictions of aihypothesis, regardless of intent. Use the phrase
following

an hypothesis to refer to any firm whose

behavior corresponds to the

—.10—

predictions

of an h-pothesis by design rather than by random chance.. Various

null models will be proposed in the analysis of the findings to try

to

distinguish

firms following an hypothesis from all others.

The mode of presentation of each hypothesis has three components. First,
the hypothesis is stated and a table of the empirical findings which will be

used to test the hypothesis is shown. Note that the findings are not an
adequate test in and of themselves. Next, a null model or set of mull models
is used to distinguish firms following the hypothesis fromthose behaving in
accord with the hypothesis but by chance. Finally, some general conclusions
about the hypothesis will be stated based on the comparison between the null
models and the actual occurrences of firms behaving in accord with the

predictions of an hypothesis. This order will be modified slightly for the
joint testing of the weak and strong intrafirm hypotheses.

This research will show that there is convincing support for all four
hypotheses —— weak intrafirrn, strong intrafirin, weak inerfirm, and strong

interfirm. The tic considerations of those hypotheses play major roles in
headquarters location decisions.

it is tempting to jump to the conclusion that the hypothesis is

satisfied for both spatial units. It seems to be especially obvious that
firms with a high number of establishments behave in accord with the predictions

of the hypothesis. However, to conclude that firms with a high number of
establishments have a greater propensity to follow the weak intrafirin motive

just from these figures may be misleading since firms in the higher categories
simply have more establishments spread around than those in lower categories.

A strong null model, based on these figures, and the results for the next

hypothesis together will help estimate the number of firms following the
weak intrafirni hypothesis. The data for the next hypothesis will be presented
before the application of the null model and statement of general conclusions
about the weak intrafirni hypothesis.

Hypothesis II:

(Strong Intrafirm Hypothesis) Headquarters will locate

"near" the manufacturing establishment of the largest size of the firm.

A combinatorial argument will be used to develop a more exact approach
to the evaluation of the results for hypotheses I and

II.

The point of this

approach is that not all firms behaving in accord with the predictions of the

hypotheses need necessarily be following the intrafirm motive. Also, it is
not possible by casual observation to determine which firms are only following

the

weak intrafirm hypothesis and which

are also following the strong intrafirm

hypothesis.

The argument starts by assuming that there are

possible decision
rules which a firm may use with regard to the intrafirm motive:
three

Decision Rule #1. Locate the headquarters randomly, without regard
for the location of the manufacturing establishments

of the firm.

Decision

Rule #2. Locate the headquarters in the same state as any
manufacturing establishment, without regard for the
size of the manufacturing establishment.

Decision Rule

#3.

Locate the headquarters in the same state as
establishment of the largest

the

manufacturing

employment size.

The state was chosen as the spatial unit because

combinatorial

it

facilitates

the ensuing

argument. Mathematical details of the null model are presented

in Appendix A. The null model estimates the number of firms following each of
the three decision rules for firms grouped by the number of establishments per

firm. The

data presented in Tables 1 and

Two conclusions will be drawn fromthis analysis.

First,

the weak intrafirm

motive las a great deal of influence on location decisions for headquarters.

According to the null model, a mean of 64.7%
establishments and

separate

of

the firms with five to nineteen

headquarters follow the weak intrafirm hypothesis.

In only four of the fifteen size categories does a majority 'of firms behave

randomly, i.e. without regard fthe basic intrafirm motive. Note also that the
correspondence between the percent of firms following Decision Rule #1 and

the number of establishments per firm is weak. Second, the strong intrafirm
motive also has a large role in the logic of headquarters location. In fact,
the null model shows that in six of the fifteen size categories the percent
of firms following the strong intrafirm motive, Decision Rule #3, is higher
than the percent of firms following the weak but not strong intrafirm motive,

Decision Rule #2. Once again, there is no powerful correlation between the
percent following Decision Rule #3 and the number of establishments per firm.

More analysis in the direction of determining the mean percent of establishments
in the same state as the largest establishment of a firm would be necessary
in further evaluation of the strong intrafirm hypothesis.
This concludes the analysis of results pertaining to hypotheses I and II.

conclusion is that well over a majority of firms, either 69.0% or

65.6%, follow the weak interfirm motive. Headquarters are strongly attracted
to the major cities for the types of t/c considerations of the weak interfirm
motive.

Now proceed to hypothesis IV, the strong form of the interfirm motive.

Hypothesis IV: (Strong Interfirm Motive) Headquarters will locate such
that the major city with the most headquarters of manufacturing firms will have

many more headquarters of manufacturing firms than any other major city. Table
5 shows the tabulations for each of the ten major cities used to test the

extended

interfirm motive in bypothesis IV.

The evidence definitely suggests accepting the strong form of the interfirm

motive. In fact, an interesting reflectionon the strength of the super—
agglomeration effect is that of the lL9 headquarters in the twenty—two counties

of the New York Meropo1itan Area, 14l are located in Manhattan. This evidence
supports the importance of face—to—face counication in the interfirm motive.
Is the strong interfirm hypothesis as well supported when the appropriate

null models are applied to the data? The null models used here are analogous to
the ones developed in Appendix B and

applied

to the data from hypothesis III.

Slight modifications of Decision Rules #4 and #5

are necessary to test hypothesis IV.

The new Decision Rules state:

Decision Rule #I—a. Locate the headquarters in the city with the most
headquarters with the same frequency as
manufacturing establishments.
Decision Rule #5—a. Locate the headquarters in the city with the most
headquarters with the same frequency as any
establishment.
Note that the null models have changed their focus from asking how many
headquarters of the 263 firms will randomly locate in the ten major cities to
asking how many headquarters of the 193 located ii the major cities will

randomly locate in New York. The modified version of Null Model I estimates
that 21.5 of the 193 headquarters located in the ten major cities will be

randomly distributed in New York by Decision Rule #4—a. Similarly, the
modified version of Null Model II estimates that 36.1 of the 193 headquarters
will end up in New. York by Decision Rule #5—a. The following chart presents
the results of this analysis:

Under either null

model,

a very high percent of the 193 firms, 61.5% or 58.3%,

follow the strong interfirm motive in locating their headquarters. The prediction
of the strong interfirm hypothesis, that the largest major city will be far

larger than any other in terms of number of headquarters of these firms, is
obviously definitely supported by the data in Table 5.

C. Examining the Macro—Hypothesis
This research attempts to estimate the degree to which simple transportation!

conunication considerations can explain headquarters location. Of all the
locational factors important to the choice of headquarters location, we want
to discern whether simple hypotheses derived from only one type of locational
factor, t/c considerations, can be used to explain the patterns of headquarters

lopation. In the preceding section the empirical evidence concerning each one

of

the fouz hypotheses was

level

examined. The final question deals

Macro—Hypothesis:

with

the macro—

-

Thansportation/Communication considerations are intrinsic

to the logic of headquarters location and can be used to explain patterns of

headquarters location. This hypothesis states that all firms will include in
their logistics logic the t/c considerations of headquarters location. Furthermore,
the macro—hypothesis predicts that the motives derived from these considerations
explain patterns of headquarters location. In other words, the macro—
hypothesis predicts that every firm with five or more establishments arid a
will

separate headquarters will follow the intrafirm and/or interfirm motives for
headquarters

location. Table 6 shows

the data used to examine the macro-hypothesis.

These results are startling in the power of the t/c considerations which

they indicate. Only 6 of the 263 firms, or 2.3%, do not behave in accord with
the predictions of either the intrafirm or the interfirm motives derived from

the t/c considerations. Of course, as the combinatorial and null models

developed in the testing of botheses I to IV have shown, the percent of firms
not following either the intrafirm or interfirm motives is definitely higher

than
in

the 2.3%. A certain

percent

of the headquarters

seeking neither to locate

the same state as one of the manufacturing establishments of the firm nor

in a major city will end up in the same state as one of

of the firm and/or in a major city anyway. An appropriate null

model for this situation is beyond the scope of this analysis. Still, it is
extremely powerful for any single set of considerations to be directly related

to the location patterns of so manyfirms.

Similarly, Marathon Oil Co., with headquarters in Findlay, Ohio, has oil and gas

lands located in Ohio. If research centers and mineral lands had been classified
as manufacturing establishments by DM1, both of these firms would be in accord with

the intrafirm motive. Certainly, many of the same t/c considerations embodied

in the intrafirm motive apply to the types of plants not classfied as manufacturing
establishments by DM1. Second, the cases of subsidiary and parent firms appear

of headquarters for subsidiaries and parent firms is more complicated than

location patterns for subsidiaries and parent firms should be reconsidered.

Finally, it is interesting to look at the locationbf the 138 firms
which behave in accord with both the intrafirm and the interfirm motives.

A distinguishing characteristic of the New York Metropolitan Area emerges
in the data in Table 7.

also has some manufacturing establishment in the

50 of the 55 firms in accord with the interfirni but not the intrafirm motive

firms with headquarters in one of the ten major cities but no manufacturing

subsidiaries discussed in section 111—A. The concentration of headquarters in

evidence

that state is further

of the super—agglomeration effect resulting from t/c nsiderations.

IV Conclusion
Transportation/communication considerations have been shown to explain or,

at least, be associated with the headquarters location patterns of a high percent of
the manufacturing firms with five or more establishments and separate headquarters
location. Both the intrafirni and the interfirm motives were found to be very signficant

factors

in the logic of headquarters location decisions. One natural extension of this

research involves applying the same hypotheses to the case of manufadturing head—
a

quarters.

Tto other particularly intriguing paths of research are encouraged by the

strength of these results. First, from the technology point of view, it

learn

from the public policy point of view, it will be important to

how the close association between t/c considerations and

headquarters

location patterns affects what government can do to influence business

logistics. Do the various strategies used to attract the headquarters office
industry to a particular area make sense in light of the importance of t/c
considerations?

Can the central business districts of major cities continue

to thrive on the importance of face—to—face communication?

These cost and effectiveness judgments deal with the costs and benefits of the time
and space factors of interpersonal communication via face—to—face, telephone, and
postal media, and of transportation of personnel and goods at various locations
for the headquarters.

15. Only data on the number of headquarters of manufacturing firms iii a major city
are available in this segment of the DM1 file. It is certainly true that the
presence of major financial and legal firms in a major city is of great importance
in influencing the location decisions of a manufacturing firm for its headquarters. Hopefully, the presence of many headquarters of manufacturing firms
in a major city would indicate the presence of the appropriate financial and
legal services in the major city.

The model will yield a negative number of firms following one or two of the
decision rules for many of the distributions of total firms, firms in accord
with the basic intrafirm motive, and firms in accord with the extended
intrafirm motive in the higher establishments per firm categoreis. This
problem is more likely statistical, i.e. due to the small sample sizes in
those categories, than a fault
the construction of he null model or a behavior

If there are i

manufacturing establishments in the same state as the headquarters

j =l,...,n-l), those j establishments could be chosen from the (n-i) manufacturing

establishments in C(n—l,j) ways. Further, the remaining (n—j—l) establishments
outside of the state in which the headquarters is located can be distributed in the

remaining 49 states in 49nj1 ways. Using the rule of product and sunaning over

So, the probability of A is: P(A) =

Null Models for the Interfirm Hypotheses

Let: X = number of firms following the basic interfirin hypothesis
Y = number of firms following decision rule #4
Z = number of firms following decision rule #5
There are 4,851 total establishments in the file of firms with five or more

establishments and a separate headquarters location. Of those 4,851 establishments,
263 are headquarters and the remaining 4,588 are manufacturirg branches. Additionally,
there are 828 total establishments located in the ten major cities -- 193
headquarters and 635 branches.

The first null model specifies that the percent of firms not following
the basic interfirm hypothesis which behavejin accord with its predictions is
equal to the ratio of manufacturing branches in the major cities to all manufacturing

branches. In other words,

or 13.8% of the headquarters located randomly,

i.e. not following the basic interfirm hypothesis, should end up in major cities
anyway

according

the the first null model. We then have two simulataneous

equations:

(1) Y = 0.138(263 — x)

(2)

Solving

X+Y=

193

yields:
-

x=181.7
Y= 11.3

The second null model states that the percent of firms not following
the basic interfirm hypothesis which behaves in accord with its predictions is
equal to the ratio of all establishments in the major cities to the total number

of establishments. In other words,

or 17.1% of the headquarters located

randomly, i.e. not following the basic interfirrn hypothesis, should end up in major

)

cities anyway according to the second null model. While equation (2) applies to
this model also, equation (1) is modified with the new ratio:

(3) Y = 0.171(263 — X)
Solving yields:

X=172.5
Y= 20.5
