    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper evaluates the Swedish Riksbank's  Inflation Reports' and draws comparisons among the Reports issued by the Riksbank, the Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. This report poses and addresses a common set of questions about each of the three central banks'  Inflation Reports'. It assesses the credibility of inflation forecasts, evaluates the Reports' discussions of the current state of the economy, asks if a coherent set of models underlies the Reports, and discusses whether the Reports hold the banks sufficiently accountable for their decisions.\n\n",
