Capital Controls and Financial Crises

NBER Working Paper No. 7398
October 1999
JEL No. F2, F3
ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to explain the reluctance of developing countries to open up their
capital market to foreigners, and the conditions inducing an emerging market economy to switch its
policies. We consider an economy characterized initially by a one-sided openness to the capital
market – domestic agents can borrow internationally, but foreign agents cannot hold domestic equity.
We identify conditions under which the emerging market's capitalists would oppose financial reform.
This would be the case if "green field" investment by multinationals would bid up real wages,
reducing thereby the rents of domestic capitalists. A financial crisis that raises the domestic interest
rate and causes a real exchange rate depreciation may induce the emerging market's capitalists to
support opening up the economy to FDI. This attitude switch is more likely to occur the greater the
debt overhang, the lower the borrowing constraint, and the weaker the market power of foreign
entrepreneurs. Even in these circumstances, the emerging market's capitalists would prefer a partial
reform to a comprehensive one -- they would prefer to maintain the restrictions on "green field" FDI.

"With so many South Korean firms in dire straits, it is hardly surprising
that westerners are flocking to Seoul in search of bargains. GM and Ford are both
close to establishing joint ventures with Daewoo and Samsung, two local car
makers, respectively. The logic of such deals is seductive: most South Korean
companies are short of cash and their shares are cheap, so outsiders should be able
to dictate the terms to their own advantage. But history cautions joint venturers to
beware. ... Most such troubles (with joint ventures) stem from South Korea's
restrictions on foreign ownership. Until recently, outsiders were barred from
owning controlling stakes in joint ventures in 'strategic' industries, such as finance.
This allowed South Korea's chaebol (conglomerates), which like to use strong
subsidiaries to prop up weak ones, to plunder joint ventures' coffers. ... The safest
course for an outsider is to buy a majority stake. This is getting easier. The
conditions of 1997's IMF bailout will accelerate the opening of South Korean
industry to foreign ownership. Wholly owned and majority-owned foreign
ventures accounted for more than 60% of the total last year, a number that is sure
to grow. For all the talk of a new embrace for foreign investors, there is nothing
like boardroom control to guarantee it."
From "South Korean joint ventures. Look before you leap", The Economist, 14-Mar-98

A widespread attitude of countries in the Far - East is the reluctance to open up their
equity market to meaningful ownership by foreign entrepreneurs. Occasionally, it takes a major
crisis to induce greater financial openness, as is exemplifies by the experience of Korea cited
above. Yet, the reluctance to open up the equity market may be stubborn enough to withstand a
deep crisis (see Malaysia's current policies).
The purpose of this paper is to explain the conflicting forces accounting for the reluctance
to open the equity market. We will provide a welfare interpretation for the divergent reactions to
the crisis, explaining why the welfare gain from opening the financial market may be elusive from
the perspective of the emerging market capitalists. We consider an economy where initially there
is a one sided integration with the global capital market – domestic agents can borrow, but foreign
entrepreneurs are not allowed to own domestic capital. We identify circumstances where, in the
absence of a crisis, the restrictions on foreign ownership of domestic capital are desirable from
the point of view of domestic capitalists. This were the case if "green field" investment by

-3-

multinationals would bid up real wages, thereby reducing the rents of domestic capitalists. In
these circumstances, if domestic capitalists are in control, thereby determining domestic policies,
there would be a one sided integration with the global capital market. Inward FDI would be
prohibited, while international borrowing by domestic agents would be allowed.
We identify conditions under which capital flight following a confidence crisis may cause
a reversal in the attitude towards capital market openness. The capital flight and the induced
increase in the domestic interest rate and the real deprecation imply that there are welfare gains
from opening the domestic equity market to foreign ownership. No attempt is made in the
present paper to explain the dynamics leading to the crisis, and the sequences described in the
paper are consistent with various scenarios.1
These arguments are summarized in Figure 2, plotting welfare in a two period economy.
The 'inverted u' shape curves depict the welfare of the representative domestic capitalist as a
function of foreign borrowing F in period 1. The solid curve (U) depicts the welfare when all
forms of FDI are prohibited. The broken curve (U p) depicts the welfare if a partial reform is
adopted in period 1, allowing the sale of domestic capital to foreign entrepreneurs. The bold
curve (Uf) corresponds to the case of a full reform, allowing unrestricted inward FDI, including
"green field" investment. In these circumstances, if the country has unrestricted access to the
global financial market, domestic capitalists will support closing the economy entirely to FDI. If,

The crisis can be explained in several ways. Radelet and Sachs (1998) and Chang and
Velasco (1998a, 1998b) attribute the crisis to an investor panic, but without addressing the origin
of the panic. Caballero and Krishnamurthy (1998) suggest it may be due to the real or perceived
inadequacy of international collateral stemming from microeconomic contractual problems. Calvo
(1999) hypothesizes that poorly informed investors may misread a shift out of emerging-market
assets by liquidity-constrained informed traders as signaling low returns and this confusion may
lead to a market collapse. The moral hazard problem associated with domestic bailouts has been
cited by various observers as a contributing factor in the Asian financial crisis [see Krugman
(1998), Dooley (1997) and Corsetti, Pesenti, and Roubini (1998)] . The implications of greater
uncertainty on the supply of international credit (and its disappearance) are studied in Aizenman
and Marion (1999).

-4-

however, the country has limited access to the capital market (hence F is restricted to below a
threshold F 0), welfare will be higher in the reformed regime. Even in this case, domestic
capitalists prefer partial financial reform, restricting "green field" investment. In these
circumstances, a financial crisis leading to capital flight may induce the domestic economy to
move towards opening its equity market to foreigners.
A key assumption driving some of the results is the presumed rivalry between the "green
field" investment and the old capital. This rivalry is induced by the increase in real wages
associated with the new capital. This effect may be reversed, however, if the old and the new
capital are complementary. While the degree to which old and new capital are complements is
subject to empirical debate, domestic capitalists may oppose unrestricted FDI as long as there is
a significant downside risk regarding the ultimate rivalry of the old and the new capital.2
Section 2 describes the economy, deriving the results described above. Section 3 provides
a simulation of a detailed example of the model. Section 4 concludes.

The results reported by Haddad and Harrison (1993) and Aitken and Harrison (1999)
support the notion that FDI bids up the real wage, and the possibility of rivalry between the
"green field" investment and the old capital. For further studies dealing with the wage and with
the productivity implications of FDI see Feenstra and Gordon (1997). See Buffie (1993) for a
model dealing with the labor market implications of FDI.

The model
Consider a 2 period economy, producing traded and non-traded goods, with the help of

labor and capital.

Preferences
The utility of the representative agent is given by

(1)

U = u(c1, T ;c1,N ) +

u(c 2, T ;c2, N )
1+ρ *

where u(ci ,T ;ci , N ) is the periodic utility at time i (i = 1, 2) associated with the consumption of
traded (ci ,T ) and non-traded (ci ,N ) goods in period i. The supply of labor is inelastic, Ls = L .

Production and endowment
The traded sector is capital intensive relative to the non-traded. For simplicity, we
assume
X1,T = (L1,T )β ; X2,T = (1 + a)(L2,T )β ; β < 1
(2)
X1, N = L1,N ; X2, N = L2, N

where Xi , j denotes the production of sector j at time i, using labor input Li , j (j =T, N; i =1, 2).
Labor moves freely between the sectors, hence

(3)

L = Li, N + Li, T ; i = 1,2.

-6-

We normalize the price of the traded good to 1, and denote the real exchange rate, defined
by the relative price of the non-traded to the traded good, by pi, N (i = 1, 2). Note that (2)
implies that the real wage equals the real exchange rate.
We consider the case where labor cannot borrow. Capitalists have access to international
borrowing, and the debt overhang is the outcome of their past borrowing. The outstanding
foreign debt at the beginning of period 1 ('debt overhang') is D1 . The gross international
borrowing in period one is F , at a real interest rate ρ . The stock of capital is owned by
domestic entrepreneurs in period 1. In the absence of capital market reforms, it will continue to
be domestically owned in period 2.

2.1

A Closed Domestic Equity Market
The current account in the absence of capital market reforms is

(4)

X1,T − c1,T = D1 − F; X2, T − c2, T = F(1 + ρ ).

Solving the labor market equilibrium at period i yields
Xi ,T = Xi, T ( pi ,N ); Xi,T ' < 0;
(5)

Li, T = Li , T (pi, N );

Li, T ' < 0;

Xi , N = L − Li,T

With unrestricted access to the global capital market, allowing lending and borrowing at a real
interest rate of ρ , the domestic entrepreneur's consumption plan is the solution to

Equation (7a) provides the demand for foreign borrowing, as a function of the foreign interest
rate. Equation (7b) provides the demand for non-traded goods. We summarize the reduced form
of these demands by

.

The first order conditions for optimal labor's consumption can be reduced to (7b).
Applying (4), (5), and (8) we infer that, under the conventional assumptions about
preferences, the real exchange rate can be reduced to

It is convenient to present the optimization problem facing the domestic agent in a way
that allows a comparison between full and restricted access to international borrowing. This can
be done by dealing separately with the budget constraints in each period, as is the case in (6).

Reforming the Capital Market
We consider now the case where the domestic economy reforms the capital market in

period 1, allowing foreign ownership of the capital stock in the second period. We assume that
foreign entrepreneurs purchase in period 1 a fraction ξ of the domestic stock of capital. This
equity position is associated with second period rents of ξ(1 − β )X2,T . Foreign entrepreneurs
discount future income at a rate of ρ , as would be the case with a linear intertemporal foreign
utility function. We would like to consider the possibility that both the domestic and the foreign
entrepreneurs operate in an oligopolistic market (like automobiles, etc.). In these circumstances,
the equity price offered to the domestic producer in the first period may be the outcome of
bargaining, splitting the future rent according to the bargaining power of the two parties.
Specifically, selling the equity in period 1 implies that the future surplus is divided between the
domestic and the foreign entrepreneurs according to weights (κ ,1 − κ ), respectively.
Consequently, the price of the equity purchased in period 1 by the foreign entrepreneur is the
discounted value of κξ(1 − β)X2,T

An illustration of the process determining the selling price is the case where both the
foreign and the domestic agents have linear utilities. Specifically, if the threat point of the
domestic capitalist is not to sell the equity, the selling price P is determined by maximizing the

In addition, we assume that opening up the economy to unrestricted inward FDI will
induce multinationals to invest in new production facilities, employing L2,MT extra labor in the
M
second period, increasing thereby the second period traded goods output by X2,T
. To simplify

the analysis, we assume that this "green field" investment is externally financed, and requires
only traded inputs in period 1. The "green field" investment modifies the second period traded
goods production to

where X2,T = (1+ a)(L2,T )β ; X 2,MT = (1+ aM )(L2,MT ) β

As before, we assume that the financial reform would result in the sale of a fraction ξ of the 'old'
capital to foreigners. The resultant current account is

The domestic entrepreneur would support opening the domestic equity market for foreign
ownership only if it would increase his net income, which is equivalent to
∂V e (ξ)
| >0
∂ξ ξ =0

(17)

.

Applying the first order conditions corresponding to (14), it follows that, with unrestricted
access to international borrowing,

(18)

 ∂V e (ξ)

sign 
|ξ = 0  = sign{κ − 1}
 ∂ξ


.

Hence, the domestic entrepreneur would not sell the equity as long as the foreign party has some
bargaining power (and would be indifferent to the outcome if κ = 1).
This is not the case, however, if the domestic entrepreneur faces borrowing constraints,
so that F ≤ F0 < F(ρ ). In the presence of a binding foreign borrowing constraint, one expects a
domestic loan market to emerge, segmented from the international market. Specifically, let Fd
denote the domestic borrowing, at a real interest rate ρd . The existence of a foreign borrowing
constraint, and segmented domestic borrowing modifies the problem facing the entrepreneur to

In these circumstances, the domestic entrepreneur will support opening the capital market if 5

the premium of the domestic real interest rate above the foreign one, exceeds the bargaining share
of foreign entrepreneurs --

This condition is more likely to hold, the greater is the credit shortage in period 1 (as will
be the case the greater the debt overhang is); the lower is the first period borrowing constraint,
F0; and the weaker is the market power of the foreign entrepreneur. If (22) holds, the F.O.C.
characterizing the equilibrium selling of domestic capital to foreigners, denoted by ξ * , is

This condition is obtained by optimizing (19), for an exogenously given F = F0.

A comprehensive reform would impact the capitalists welfare in two ways. The direct
∂V fe (ξ)
effect is the outcome of selling the equity [equals at the margin to
]. The indirect effect
∂ξ
is the impact of the "green field" investment on the second period rent. This in turn is given by

(24)

∆ [ (1− β)X 2, T ] = (1− β)

∂X2, T f
[ p − p2, T ] < 0,
∂p2, T 2, T

where p2, T ( p2,f T ) is the real exchange rate in the absence of FDI liberalization (with
comprehensive liberalization). Equation (24) follows from the observation that the new
investment by multinationals increases the demand for labor by L2,MT , bidding up real wages (= the
real exchange rate), so that p2,f T − p2, T > 0 . The "green filed" investment cuts the rents of 'old
capital', reducing the welfare of domestic capitalists. This adverse rent effect would impact
domestic capitalists even if they would not sell their equity to the foreign entrepreneurs. The
"green field" investment imposes a pecuniary externality, due to the incipient increase in the
demand for labor.
It can be verified that with full access to international borrowing, no domestic capitalist
would sell his equity position. Hence, the equilibrium ξ is zero. Nevertheless, opening the
economy to unrestricted FDI would reduce the welfare of domestic entrepreneurs if it were to
induce "green field" investment. Consequently, emerging market capitalists will support capital
controls prohibiting inward FDI in order to protect them against this adverse effect. A financial
crisis reducing drastically borrowing below a borrowing constraint F0, may induce reluctant
domestic entrepreneurs to open up the economy to FDI. This would be the case if the beneficial
effect of alleviating the shortage of funds in period 1 is large enough. It should compensate for
the adverse effects of selling the equity at a discount due to limited bargaining power, and for the

- 14 -

decline of future rents due to future wage increases. Hence, a deep enough crisis may induce FDI
liberalization.
Note that the interests of labor and capital regarding inward FDI clash. Opening the
economy to FDI would clearly raise GNP. The impact of the real exchange rate appreciation on
the real GNP, evaluated in terms of traded goods, is

(25)

∂[ Lp2, T + (1− β)(1− ξ)X2,T ]
∂p2,T

= L − (1− ξ)L 2,T > 0

Hence, the "green field" investment increases real GNP. Thus, if labor is 'in control', opening up
to FDI is Labor's policy choice, even in the absence of a crisis. It can be verified that labor's gain
exceeds capitalists' loses. This suggests that, if the attitude of capitalists is the obstacle to the
reform, a side payment from labor to capitalists may be needed to induce a reform. This transfer
may be implemented by shifting part of the debt service to the tax payer.

We close this section with a simulation, plotting the dependency of domestic
entrepreneurs' welfare on borrowing, F. Figure 1 reports the utility in the absence of any reform
(U), and with full reform, opening the economy to unrestricted inward FDI (U f). The optimal
borrowing in the non reformed regime is about 0.24, and in the fully reformed regime about 0.17.
The drop in borrowing induced by the reform reflects the adverse wealth effect brought about by

- 17 -

the "green field" investment, as lower borrowing is needed to support the first period
consumption. This adverse welfare effect implies that domestic capitalists are worse off in the
fully liberalized regime. Hence, in line with our pervious discussion, domestic capitalists would
oppose inward FDI if they have full access to international borrowing.
We turn now to a comparison of the utility and the first period real exchange rate for the
case where the financial crisis imposes a borrowing constraint on the economy. In Figure 2 we
contrast 3 scenarios -- no FDI allowed (U); no "green field" investment allowed, but equity
purchase by foreigners is allowed (Up), and full FDI liberalization (Uf). Suppose that the onset
of the financial crisis imposes a borrowing constraint of F0 = 0.09. It can be verified that at this
low level of international borrowing, domestic capitalists are better off selling part of their
domestic equity. The optimal equity sale in the two reformed regimes, for F0 = 0.09, turned out
to be ξp* = 0.42; ξ*f = 0.36 (where ξp* ; ξ *f denotes the optimal equity sale in the partially and
the fully reformed regimes, respectively). The utilities Up and Uf reported in Figure 2 correspond
to these optimal equity sales.
The relative position of the curves implies that the financial panic would induce domestic
capitalists to support the reform. If domestic capitalists would have the choice, they would
prefer the partial reform to the comprehensive one. This follows from the observation that the
bold curve Uf (corresponding to the capitalists' welfare with full reform) is below the broken
curve Up (corresponding to the capitalists' welfare with partial reform). The vertical difference
between these curves measures the adverse income effect of the drop in second period domestic
rents due to the increase in real wages attributed to the "green field" investment. This adverse
income effect corresponds to the transfer of income to labor. Labor gains both from this transfer,
and from the added income associated with the higher wages paid by other employers, induced
by the "green field" investment.
The above provides, in a nut-shell, an interpretation for the impact of the crisis on capital
market reforms. The crisis has lead foreigners to reduce drastically their exposure to Korea,
setting a very low level for F . This in turn led to a sharp increase of the real interest rate, and to

a sharp real depreciation. In these circumstances, the (previously unattractive) option of selling
domestic capital to foreigners becomes a desirable one. A key factor contributing to the regime
switch is the crisis, leading to capital flight and to a sharp increase in the domestic real interest
rate. Note that a large debt overhang may be a precondition for the regime switch.

Concluding remarks
The purpose of this paper is to explain the reluctance to open up capital markets in

developing countries, and to study the impact of a financial crisis on the attitude towards
financial reforms. We consider an economy where, prior to the crisis, the emerging market's
capitalists have unrestricted access to international borrowing, but inward FDI is prohibited. We
identified a key role for a crisis and the resultant capital flight in inducing the country to open up.
The paper views debt overhang as the 'culprit', explaining the vulnerability to capital
flight. No attempt was made to model the forces leading to the build up of this debt overhang.
The model described above is consistent with various scenarios, including the possibility that
domestic producers used foreign borrowing to maximize non economic objectives [like size], and
thus overextending their investment [see Krugman (1998) and the lead citation from the
Economist]. This may explain the 'cleansing effect' of the crisis, punishing corporations that
abused their access to the international capital market and the implicit insurance provided to them
by the domestic tax payers. All these issues can be added to the above framework, providing a
richer, and more realistic account of the crisis dynamics.
